This material has been compiled for the general information of members of the dental profession and others interested in the public health measure. Note: Each item is quoted verbatim from the source listed. If this material is requoted, it is urged that care be exercised to make certain that the quotation is accurate. This article has only one purpose: to furnish information on the background, qualifications and activities of the best known opponents of fluoridation for use by those persons or groups contemplating, planning or engaged in a fluoridation effort on a one-time or continuing basis. The American Dental Association does not intend nor does it authorize any use of the article beyond this precise purpose.

AMER. DENT. ASSN.: Vol. 71, Nov. 1965 AMERICAN ACADEMY OF NUTRITION (GRANVILLE F. KNIGHT) From the Journal of the Southern California State Dental Association, October, 1953: ... Recently, the Directors of the American Academy of Nutrition announced their opposition to the fluoridation of community water calling it \"experimental mass medication.\" It would be interesting to know who persuaded them to take such an illogical action, separating themselves from almost the entire medical, dental, and public health professions, and bedding down with the chiropractors, the food faddists, and the anti-scientific religions. Perhaps they too read only the tracts published by the anti-s. Apparently the Academy, which held such bright promise, is being taken over by the fanatical fringe. The only hope for it, as a lasting instrument for good, lies in its professional members subscribing to conservative nutrition journals, and studying under nutritionists who are NOT members of the Academy. Fanaticism is usually the result of the inbreeding of ideas. The Academy has, of course, full right to oppose fluoridation. That its action will be given full publicity in every community considering the plan is a foregone conclusion. The impressive title of the Academy is a weapon to be exploited and it will be. From the July 3, 1956, Oroville California Mercury: When it comes to fighting fluoridation of water, the most astonishing statements are made. . . . Here is an example of this: Following the convention of the American Academy of Nutrition in Los Angeles its president, Dr. Granville F. Knight of Santa Barbara gave an interview to the Los Angeles Times. In it he said: \"In Detroit no less than 80 persons became ill after drinking water containing a higher than normal fluoride content. Weakness developed in their legs and arms, they fell down in the streets, felt a tingling in their hands and feet, and some even developed emotional confusion. \"A few deaths have been reported elsewhere .... \" ... This is an excellent example of the unprincipled opposition waged against fluoridation .... From a letter from the Department of Investigation, American Medical Association, April 16, 1962: ... There is also indication in the file that the publications of the American A._ademy of Nutrition and the American Nutrition Society indicate \"approval and acceptance of the belief that malnutrition in this country is widespread and that it is the result of the following faulty conditions or practices: 1. Use of pasteurized rather than raw milk. 2. Use of non-fertile rather than fertile eggs. 3.Ingestion of mixed meals. 4. Use of canned fruits and vegetables. 5. Use of white flour rather than freshly milled whole grains or sprouted grains. 6. Use of refined sugars. 7. Use of plant foods of all types grown on impoverished soils. 8. Use of chemically pure or synthetic vitamins. 9. , Use of chemically-contaminated foodstuffs resulting from pesticides, etc. (addition of fluo\u00ad rides to water supplies is opposed).\" Some of the members of the Academy, in the past, at least, have their place in the files of this Department as having a more commercial than scientific interest in nutrition .... From a letter by the Director, American Dental Association, Bureau of Public Infor\u00ad mation, August 3, 1962: ... He is a long-time anti-fluoridationist and has written extensively against the measure calling it \"mass medication without precedent \" and charging that the public was being used \"as human guinea pigs.\" ... Dr. Knight is one of the sponsors of the anti-fluoridationis t Medical-De ntal Committee on the Evaluation of Fluoridation .... He is also a leader of the anti-fluoridati onist John Birch Society. FLUORIDATION OPPONENTS 1157 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR MEDICO-PHYSICAL RESEARCH (S. EDGAR BOND and ADOLPH E. SCHNEIDER) From a letter from Bureau of Investigation , American Medical Association, May 26, 1955: ... The biographic records indicate that S. Edgar Bond of Webster, Ind., was born there in 1876, He obtained a diploma from the Physio-Medical College of Indiana in 1904 and was licensed to practice medicine in Indiana that same year. He is not a member of his local medical society .... Bond is known to us, also, as having used for a good many years the Koch treatment, another piece of cancer quackery. His name appears, also, as a member of the Board of Trustees of the \"American Association for Medico-Physical Research,\" on a 1952 letterhead. This is a group of quacks and faddists, devoted originally to the Abrams technique, but later to other weird medical schemes and treatments .... With respect to Adolph E. Schneider, we find his name listed among those who are officers of the \"American Association for Medico-Physical Research,\" mentioned above. In this he is shown as \"D.D.S., M.D.,\" but we have no record of him as a Doctor of Medicine. He was, however, listed in Polk's Dental Directory for 1925 as a graduate of Northwestern University Dental School in 1901. Our principal information concerning Schneider is in connection with his \"Oxygen Therapy \" apparatus. This has had various names, but is principally known as \"Modified Oxygen.\" He has also operated what he calls the \"Oscillo-Therapy Research Institute \" in Chicago. There is also indication that an Adolph E. Schneider of Chicago had a rather questionable connection with one George C. Erickson. Erickson was selling the \"Vrilium Tube,\" an inert therapeutic bauble, to the gullible, at rather high prices. The Federal Food and Drug Administration caused the prosecution of Erickson and his partner for misbranding the Vrilium Tube. The hook-up as between Erickson and Schneider is not clear, but apparently some of the customers of Erickson were referred to Schneider for \"Oxygen Therapy.\" This occurred along about 1941. AMERICAN CAPSULE NEWS (DR. MORRIS A. BEALLE) From Redbook Magazine, \"The Fear Campai gn Against the Polio Vaccine,\" April, 1956: ... Another campaigner is Morris A. Bealle, who carries on his anti-Salk vaccine activities from Washington, D.q., where he edits a newsletter called American Capsule News. Bealle is the author of several books, among them \"Medical Mussolini,\" which attacks the American Medical Association, and \"The Drug Story,\" which attacks what he calls \"the drug trust.\" When Bealle sent specimen copies of his newsletter to potential subscribers, whom he addressed as polio crusaders, he wrote to them that (Duon H.) .Miller was \"particularly interested in our reports on Salk vaccine and its present and future effects on its victims.\" On the other hand, Bealle told me, \"Miller is one of our sources of polio information.\" Like Miller, Bealle rejects the \"bug\" theory of polio. Instead, his position is this: Polio strikes in hot weather, and in hot weather people consume a lot of ice cream and soft drinks. Here, he says, lies the origin of polio .... From a memorandum of August 20, 1956, from the chief of the Division of Dental Public Health of the US Public Health Service: Enclosed are copies of the AMERICAN CAPSULE NEWS. This publication opposes fluoridation, the Salk vaccine, and other public health measures. It is edited by Morris A. Bealle. This gentleman, according to Flora Rheta Schreiber, writing in the April, 1956, issue of Redhook Magazine, \"is the author of several books, among them 'Medical Mussolini,' which attacks the American Medical Association, and the 'Drug Story' which attacks what he calls 'the drug trust.' ... \"Bealle rejects the bug theory of polio. Instead, his position is this: Polio strikes in hot weather, and in hot weather people consume a lot of ice cream and soft drinks. Here, he says, lies the origin of polio. . . . \" From The Doctors' Dilemmas, by Louis Lasagna, MD, Harper and Brothers, 1962- pages 209-210: 1158 J. AMER. DENT. ASSN.: Vol. 71, Nov. 1965 One eccentri c periodical is American Capsule News, edited in Washington by Morris A. Bealle. The four-page sheet comes out weekly, describing itself as \"America's real FREE PRESS -uncontrolled by any political theory, organization or ideology; unkept by any advertising cabal, undaunted by any Smear Bund .... \" The .May 30, 1959, issue warned its readers that fluoridated tap water, introduced in many parts of the U.S. to prevent dental caries, was yielding \"heartrending'' results. In Sheboygan, \"middle-aged people are old; young people are middle-aged. The fluoride shuffle is a common thing about pedestrians. The undertaking business is reported flourishing.\" The writer goes on to hint darkly that the death rate has gone up significantly since the start of fluoridation, but that he has been unable to procure the actual figures because \"our correspondents there say it would be dangerous to try it.\" Six months later, Capsule News was slugging away at the drug industry, pontificating that \"no drug ever cured a disease or disorder.\" To Mr. Bealle, there is only one disease-\"toxemia, or nature's efforts to rid the system of an overload of toxin. To get rid of toxins is the cure; not putting more in through chemical injections or doses.\" Arthritis is due to \"faulty calcium assimilation and metabolism.\" All evils in modern medicine can be traced to the Rockefeller family, who are \"the largest manufacturers of drugs\"-a fact which will come as news to those owning. stock in the drug industry-and whose \"Rockefeller Foundation is a fake. . . .\" The Foundation was alleged to promote its. sordid work by gifts to medical schools and by dictating the writing of \"all medical books.\" Medical journalism of this sort is, fortunately, only one extreme of the spectrum. AMERICANISM BULLETIN (W. D. HERRSTROM) From The Journal of the American Dental Association, May, 1952: .. Many ( of the arguments against fluoridation) are to be found in a little known publi\u00ad cation entitled Americanism Bulletin edited by a self-styled world traveler and news analyst, W. D. Herrstrom, of Faribault, Minnesota. Editor Herrstrom, campaigning against fluoridation of communi ty drinking water, has gone to no end of trouble to compile a list of arguments indicating the harmful results of adopting a fluoridation program. First and foremost, cautions the Faribault news analyst, \"our national health services are promoting this scheme. They are operating under the same political bosses who told us that Bolshevik Russia and Communism were harmless. . . . The same political bosses are . . . for socialized medicine and fluoridation is socialization entering through the back door.\" \u00b7 Dragging in communism, socialism, or even the everyday garden variety of American politics is inexcusable when discussing the pros and cons of a public health measure such as water fluoridation. Both the American Dental Association and the American Medical Association have approved the fluoridation program and both associations for years have waged unceasing war on government control of health services. The Faribault editor plays further on the fears of a war-wearied world by warning that \"the mechanism for fluoridation of water supplies in any community would provide the perfect weapon for saboteurs. With large amounts of the fluorides in storage the enemy could dump these into the water supplies and destroy all the people in the community.\" This sounds like something found in the wildest \"who-done- it.\" ... Cox and Ast point out that even in the case of gross negligence it would require more than four tons of sodium fluoride per million gallons of water processed to produce a concentration of 450 ppm fluorine-sufficient to pro\u00ad duce salivatio n and vomiting-and such a concentration they point out is not possible in any program of water fluoridation. \"If,\" queries Mr. Herrstrom, \"fluorides harden the teeth what is to prevent them from hardening all the bones in the body making them easy to break and too weak to support the body.\" If the Minnesota editor were as well informed as he would have his readers believe he , would know that several studies have been made by excellent authorities which indicate that the concentration of fluoride in the public water supply shows no effect on the incidence of bone fracture. Neither time nor space nor the patience of the reader permits a listing of the 25 reasons advanced by the Faribault world traveler as to why community water supplies should not be fluoridated, but one of his reasons is so ridiculous that it hardly needs to be challenged. \"It is reported,\" writes Mr. Herrstrom in his September 1951 bulletin which sells for 10 cents, \"that in Russia fluorine was added to the milk given babies in order to weaken their wills and made them more amenable to dictatorship when they grow up. This method was used following FLUOR I DAT ION OPPONENTS I 159 the revolution in 1917. Is the American public going to be 'doped' into submission to dic\u00ad tatorship here?\" The answer is \"no\" and neither is the American public going to be \"doped\" into believing the anti-fluoridation nonsense published for profit by world traveler Herrstrom in his AmBricanism Bulletin. ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS From Testimony of Frederick B. Exner, MD, before the California Public Utilities Commission at a public hearing on Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies held at Oroville, October 20-21, 1955: The House of Delegates of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, Inc., adopted the above resolution opposing and condemning all compulsory mass-medication. Exception was made for measures necessary for control of epidemics or communicable disease; but since toothdecay. is not contagious, the exception does not apply. Fluoridation, was in fact, the actual target of the resolution, although it was stated as a general principle, as it should be stated. So when anyone tells you that no responsible medical organization has come out against fluoridation, you can tell them that the most responsible of them all is definitely opposed to it. From the May, 1958, News Letter of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons; statement by Dr. Mal Rumph, president: On the matter of fluoridation of public water supplies. Let's set the record straight .... On October 8, 1955, the Association adopted a resolution condemning mass-medication .. No mention was made of \"fluoridation.\" ... At the San Francisco sessions oh April 12, 1958, the Association adopted a resolution condemning the use of water supply as vehicle for drugs . . . . No mention was made of fluoridation .... The Association is not in a position to take a scientific stand .... It has no research personnel or facilities .... As a result, it could not give an official scientific opinion. The Association's official position is this and only this: \"It con\u00ad demns mass medication and it condemns the use of water supply as vehicle for drugs.\" From a letter from Bureau of Investigation, American Medical Association, February 11, 1959: According to the New York Herald Tribune for December 30, 1943, the Association was incorporated, not for profit, in Gary, Ind., in December 1943, by members of the Lake County (Ind.) Medical Society, \"to block the regimentation of American medicine under compulsory systems of bureaucratic federal control.\" ... Under the circumstances, it appears that the group is an organization of physicians having as its aims and purposes, matters which are essentially socio-economic. We are aware of the fact that a resolution indicating an opposition to \"compulsory mass medication\" was adopted by the Association in 1955. It was after the American Medical Association, at its meeting in Philadelphia in December 195 7, adopted a resolution endorsing fluoridation that this group decided to disagree. . . . From May, 1962, American Dental Association Information Bulletin: ... Another AAPS officer is Granville F. Knight, M.D. He has written extensively in oppo\u00ad sition to fluoridation calling it \"mass medication without precedent\" and charging that the public was being used \"as human guinea pigs.\" Two other AAPS officers are Mal Rumph, M.D., Fort Worth, Tex., and James L. Doenges, M.D., Anderson, Ind., both of whom are listed in a 1958 issue of \"Free Enterprise \" as members of the Wake Up America Committee , of We, the People!, an ultra-conservative and anti\u00ad fluoridationist organization. Four of the officers of AAPS have been listed at one time or another as sponsors of the anti-fluoridationist Medical-Dental Committee on Evaluation of Fluoridation: Dr. Exner and Dr. Knight, mentioned above; Charles W. Pavey, M.D., Columbus, Ohio, and Louis S. Wegryn, M.D., Elizabeth, N.J. Five of the current AAPS officers are leaders of the ultra-conservative, anti-fluoridationist John Birch Society: George J. Hess, M.D., Bunker Hill, Ill., AAPS president; Dr. Knight, speaker of the AAPS-House of Delegates, and Drs. Pavey, Wegryn and Doenges, members the AAPS Board . . . 1160 J. AMER. DENT. ASSN.: Vol. 71, Nov. 1965 AMERICAN MERCURY From a manuscript ( 1960) by Perry Ottenberg, assistant professor, department of psychiatry, University of Pennsylva nia medical school: The American Mercury, managed by Russell Maguire, is one of the most powerful journals carrying anti-scientific articles. Dr. Leo Spira, writing in the American Mercury, states that he has diagnosed as a conse\u00ad quence of drinking fluoridated water, illnesses which manifested itching, outbreaks of boils, \"athlete's foot,\" deafness, brown patches of skin, feminization of men, fits of depression, constipation and excessive gas, ulcers and mental disease. DR. CHARLES BETTS From the Milwaukee Journal, March 31, 1953: Dr. Betts is president of an organization he calls the \"Anti-Cancer Club of America.\" The principal idea of the dub is that food cooked in aluminum pans causes cancer-a theory without backing from reputable scientists. Dr. Betts received his license in Ohio in 1900 when some licenses were being granted without dental school training. Dr. Betts admits he did not go to dental school. Dr. Betts is a member of a group called the \"American Association for Medico-Physical Research,\" which the A.M.A. has called \"another society catering to the twilight zone of professionalism.\" Dr. Betts is known for his oppos1t1on to vaccination and other accepted public health practices, such as pasteurization. From the Toledo Blade, May 27, 1954: According to Oliver Field, director of the A.M.A.'s (American Medical Association) bureau of investigation, he (Dr. Betts) \"has for many years been engaged in the business of selling pamphlets on unscientific medical subjects. He has set himself up as an authority on the alleged poisonous characteristics\u00b7 of aluminum cooking utensils. \"In some of his printed material, Betts claims 'Fellowship' in the 'American Association for Medico-Physical Research. ' This is an organization ... devoted to the Abrams idea (healing with electrons) and several other unscientific but apparently profitable methods. \" JOHN BIRCH SOCIETY From column by Ralph McGill, editor, Atlanta Constitution, published in the Chicago Daily News, March 21, 1961: ... No less an expert than J. Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned against those who make reckless, unsustained charges without justification. They make his job more difficult. There is, for example, an organization bearing the name of John Birch . . . . It goes so far as to declare that Dwight D. Eisenhower is a Communist or a stooge of Communists. They declare President Kennedy also to be a Red. . . Even fluoridation is denounced by some as a Communist plan to poison America's water supply. Most of those who make preposterous and unsustained charges do not know what Communism is or how it operates. The danger of it is ever-present and must be exposed. But those who, with unsupported scatter-gun charges, are making the Americans fear one another are doing Communism a service. From Pine Bluff (Ark.) Commercial, April 1, 1961: ... Consider the men and things which the John Birchers or their founders have already conceded to the Communists: They include the President and his predecessor; the Supreme Court; the nation's city managers; the urban renewal advocates; the proponents of fluorida\u00ad tion; the United Nations. These people don't need condemnation. They need help. They need, each of them, a quick course in American history, a heart-to-heart talk with a trustworthy friend and then, perhaps, a good long rest. . . . \u00b7\u00b7- FLUORIDATION OPPONENTS 1161 From an article in the Anti-Defamation League Bulletin, June, 1961, by Benjamin R.Epstein, entitled ''Democracy and the John Birch Society:\" . . The enemy is everywhere. Fluoridation of water is a plot; so too is legislation calling for registration of guns .... From a letter of July 7, 1961, from the Attorney General of the State of California: ... In assessing patriotism most Americans would feel the need for differentiating between a paid agent of the Soviet espionage apparatus on the one hand and an American who believes in fluoridation or mental health programs or the UN or federal aid to education--or all four of these--on the other hd. Not so Mr. Welch. He d tlie Birchers angrily lump all these together under the blanket accusation of treason. . . . From the December 10, 1961, New York Times Magazine, in an article by Thomas M.Storke, entitled \"How Some Birchers Were Birched:\" ... It was revealed as a holding company for virulent \"aginner \" groups that say, as does the title of a current London show, \"Stop the world, I want to get off\"-groups that are against democracy; against all income taxes; against the welfare and protective activities of the Government, which it calls socialism; against our participation in the United Nations; against foreign aid; against alliances for mutual protection with NATO and SEATO nations; against organized labor; against academic freedom; even against fluoridation. . . . From the Winter, 1961, Jewish Times, in an article by Robert E. Segal, entitled \"Who Are the Foes of Fluoridation?:\" ... But .that doesn't mean we close out the possibility of a heavy dose of Birchism in the Wellesley campai gn. Nor was it necessarily absent in the Brookline campai gn. Indeed, chances are that the John Birchers will have plenty to say about the Newton. vote on fluoridation. All they have to do is turn ,.to Page 13 of the February, 1960, John Birch Society Bulletin and get these pointers: \"HOW TO DEFEAT FLUORIDATION IN YOUR CITY. Call a meeting of those interested. Raise $25 or $50 or more. Then buy a supply of many .Jcinds of tracts and pamphlets that expose the horrors of fluoridation. Every two weeks mail a different article, by a different writer to ALL of your top city officials, school board, PT A, ministers and leaders in the city. Never stop or slow down. Keep that up for months if necessary. That is what we did here in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and we won. So can you. If you live in a large enougp. city, or if the Communists have been able to beguile a sufficiently large enough, powerful enough, and deter\u00ad mined enough clique into supporting fluoridation, the above formula, alone, may not stop them. But following it conscientiously will do the job in many places .... \" Again, in the July, 1960, Birch Society Bulletin, skyrockets of praise are sent up for California followers of Bob Welch who did in the profluoridation forces. E. H. BRONNER From the Milwaukee Journal, March 24, 1953: An example (of fluoridation opponents ) is \"Dr.\" E. H. Bronner of Los Angeles, who says he is a chemist. Bronner is one of fluoridation's most active and loudest opponents. He addressed meetings at Seattle, \u00b7wash., where fluoridation was beaten, 2 to 1. He spoke at Clinton, Iowa, and the city council decided there was too much opposition to adopt fluoridation . . Bronner charges that fluoridatin is a plot of the Communists to take over this country. He says fluoridation is \"poison.\" Bronner calls it \"treason.\" . . . But after he had made several speeches, the Clinton Herald became suspicious of him and started investigating. Bronner left town when it was discovered that he was an escapee from the Elgin (Ill.) state mental hospital. ' From the Milwauke-e Journal, March 25, 1953: \"Dr.\" E. H. Bronner of Los Angeles, formerly of -Milwaukee, an escapee from an Illinois state mental institution, led mass meetings in Seattle against fluoridation. Bronner is not a physician. He told Seattle vote_rs that fluoridation was a Communist plot, collectivisim and \"socialized medicine. \" 1162 J. AMER. DENT. ASSN.: Vol. 71, Nov. 1965 From a letter to the editor, from Dale G. Parker, DDS, MS, published in the Capital Journal (Salem, Oregon) Oct. 28, 1954: I have before me an article printed in the October 23 issue of the Capital Journal in.'which a Dr. E. H. Bronner of Los Angeles is quoted at length as saying: \"As a Research Chemist . . . based on years of practical experience in health food and chemical field, I wish to state . 'fluoridation of drinking water is pure insanity!' ... For some so-called 'doctors' to be able to persuade a civilized nation to add-voluntarily-a deadly poison to its drinking water is unbelievable and is the very height of criminal insanity.\" Recently I moved to Salem from the State of Iowa and the name of Dr. E. H. Bronner recalled a town meeting in the city of Clinton, Iowa, January 30, 1952, called to decide whether or not to fluoridate the water supply there. Dr. Bronner spoke vehemently against fluoridation at this meeting. Two days later, on February 1, 1952, the news staff of the Clinton Herald exposed with indisputable evidence that Dr. Bronner was: 1. An escaped inmate of the Elgin, Illinois State Hospital for the mentally ill. 2.He had been committed to this hospital on March 27, 1946, as mentally ill and had escaped in 194 7. From a letter from Dr. Daniel Haffron, superintendent of the Elgin State Hospital, Elgin, Ill., May 9, 1955: Emil Bronner was received here by commitment from Cook County on March 27, 1946. He was considered here to be mentally ill. On July 7, 1947, he left.without proper authoriza\u00ad tion and was considered to be on escape. As a result of a regulation issued by the Department of Welfare recently, patients on unauthorized absence for a period of more than five years were orderd absolutely discharged. Such a discharge was issued in the case of Mr. Bronner on March 10, 1955. DR. CHARLES A. BRUSCH From The Hartford (Conn.) Courant, July 3, 1956: Recently the Hartford Council, setting out to study both sides of the fluoridation question\u00ad just as though there were two sides-succeeded in hearing a single medical doctor who would oppose fluoridated water. He was Dr. Charles A. Brusch of the Brusch Medical Center, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Through courtesy of the Massachusetts Medical Society The Courant can now give its readers a thumbnail description of this licensed physician. The Society's dossier on Dr. Brusch begins in 1952, when a Boston advertising firm prepared a glossy print of Dr. Brusch together with a pretty patient and apparatus described as \"the revolutionary new Guarino kidney.\" According to the announcement, widespread use of this apparatus would in twelve months save \"four to five million lives.\" The \"significant discovery\" was announced by Dr. Brusch. Physicians at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital said the conclusions in the article were not warranted. Dr. Brusch denied that the publicity material was ever used, but did not disavow the publicity that appeared in several magazines. In 1953 the Health Commissioner of .Massachusetts brought to the attention of the Massa\u00ad chusetts Medical Society a six-page article by Dr. Brusch on the dangers of fluoridation. This article has been used frequently by other anti-fluoridation people, including the Fairfield Pure Water Committee. Among other things Dr. Brusch said: \"Continued use in the drinking water of children would in time render them more susceptible to the ordinary diseases of childhood ... It would also render them highly sensitive to leukemia, polio, diabetes, tuberculosis and cancer.\" When the statement was read to Dr. Brusch he said he had been misquoted, and that \"there is no tieup with conditions like leukemia and cancer. This is so far-fetched that there is no sense in it.\" On May 2, 1955, Dr. Brusch was one of a group who announced their scientific findings that \"vodka, made in this country, leaves less of a hangover than bourbon whiskey, gin, or rum.\" In November, 1954, Dr. Brusch, obviously a busy research man, gave a \"clinical evaluation\" of appetite depressants and spoke a good word for \"Ayds,\" a trademarked product sold commercially. On November 14, 1955, a news item appeared in many newspapers to the effect that Dr. FLUORIDATION OPPONENTS 1163 Brusch's research had also disclosed that \"Dr. Edwards Olive Tablets were more effective than others.\" Back again to his laboratory, and early in 1955 an advertisement for Vicks Medi\u00ad trating Cough Syrup appeared, backed by a \"clinical evaluation\" of Dr. Brusch. And in January of this year, Dr. Brusch published an article on \"Chronic Rheumatic Disease\" in which he found that Baume Ben Gay was helpful to those with rheumatoid arthritis. Before noon of April 13, 1955, the front page of a Boson newspaper displayed a three\u00ad quarter page picture of Dr. Brusch giving the \"first inoculation of the Salk anti-polio vaccine\" to an eleven-year-old child. At that time other Massachusetts physicians had no Salk vaccine. They had received notice that \"vaccine would be available as soon as licensed by the National Institute of Health.\" Dr. Brusch stated that he had been unable to avoid this publicity. That is part of the record as compiled by the Massachusetts Medical Society. Does Hartford take the word of this man as being of more weight on fluoridation than its own city and state health departments-and that of virtually all the doctors and dentists in the country? LAURENCE E. BUNKER From the Winter, 1961, issue of Jewish Times, in an article by Robert E. Segal, entitled \"Who Are the Foes of Fluoridation?\": Now that Brookline pro-fluoridation people have Jost an election by a close squeeze and Wellesley has defeated the proposal by a whacking vote .... In the Wellesley defeat, alert people were quick to note that Colonel Laurence E. Bunker, a former aide to General Douglas MacArthur, played an important role. Now wasn't Colonel Bunker on the Council of the John Birch Society, they asked? He surely was .... From Time Magazine, March 24, 1961, an article entitled \"Fluoridation Fails Again\": .. , In the key Wellesley campaign, the chief opponent was the Rev. Andrew G. Rosenberger . . . His far-right-hand man was Laurence E. Bunker, a former aide of General Douglas MacArthur, and a member of the council of the semisecret, archconservative John Birch Society (TIME, March 10). . . . Bunker noted darkly that the Daily Worker had supported fluoridation, and insisted: \"This is not a question on which any group has a right to vote. No group has a right to force taxpayers to take medicine not recommended by their own doctor.\" ... CITIZENS MEDICAL REFERENCE BUREAU From the Cincinnati Enquirer, \"The Truth About Fluoridation,\" March, 1953: A second source of anti-fluoridation information is the \"Citizens Medical Reference Bureau, Inc .... \" \"Their main function appears to be opposing vaccination of school children,\" the Better Business Bureau says. From the Lafayette (Calif.) Sun, April 16, 1954: But what is the Citizens Medical Reference Bureau? I learned this from local medical men, who quoted Dr. Fred Wertheimer, director of the Bureau of Dental Health, Michigan State Department of Health: The Citizens Medical Reference Bureau is run by an elderly man and wife who have no medical affiliation. But they do have impressive titles and have \"earned\" a very-good income for years by opposing public health measures. Their business is financed by the sale of pamphlets and contributions. In 1920 they published a booklet, \"Horrors of Vaccination-Exposed and Illustrated\" and in 1929, \"Facts Against Vaccination. \" Both booklets use about the same arguments against vaccination as they now present against fluoridation. From the Toledo Blade, May 28, 1954: H. B. Anderson, secretary, Citizens Medical Reference Bureau, which publishes pamphlets in the fight against fluoridation, has put out \"Koch's drug for cancer\" according to the A.M.A. investigator ( Oliver Field). 1164 J. AMER. DENT. ASSN.: Vol. 71, Nov. 1965 C.LEON DeARY AN From the Winter, 1961, issue of Jewish Times, in a column by Robert E. Segal on \"Who Are the Foes of Fluoridation?\": ... Mortimer Kass, director of the Anti-Defamation League's information department cited C. Leon DeAryan, professional anti-Semite, who declared that fluoridation is an attempt on the part of Jews to \"weaken the Aryan race mentally and spiritually.\" ... DELANEY COMMITTEE (DR. A. L. MILLER) From The Journal of the American Dental Association, September, 1952, a report by J. Roy Doty, PhD, and W. Philip Phair, DDS, MPH: The Delaney Committee report on fluoridation acknowledges that the preponderance of scientific evidence supports the conclusion that fluoridation is a safe and effective procedure for the control of dental caries. The Committee itself concludes that the efficacy of the procedure is amply demonstrated but expresses vague apprehensions concerning possible toxic action from a cumulative effect of the fluoride .... It is our opinion that the Congressional Committee report suffers from a lack of adherence to the proper standards of investigative procedure as evidenced especially by its failur to substantiate many statements which it accepted as fact. The Committee also accepted misgivings of a few individuals who appeared as witnesses, in spite of the weight of the evidence furnished by such organizations as the American Dental Association, the American Medical Association, the United States Public Health Service, the National Research Council, the American Public Health Association and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers. The Com\u00ad mittee, through its statement that \"dental decay is not contagious nor can it be said to constitute a serious danger to health,\" implies that a disease is not a community problem unless it is contagious and fails to recognize the fact that dental caries (decay) is the most prevalent disease of mankind. From Missouri Medicine, Journal of the Missouri State Medical Association, Feb\u00ad ruary, 1954: Dr. A. L. Miller is a former state health officer of Nebraska, from which state he is now a U.S. Representative and a member of the Delaney committee .... His arguments disregard the weight of evidence and do not show regard for the realities of the situation in his recom\u00ad mendation that fluorine be provided by means of tablets or supplement in milk. . . . He has tortured the meaning of words in attempting to \"interpret \" the forthright approval by the American Medical Association of the fluoridation of water supplies. He has fallen into serious factual error in using inappropriate vital statistics in evaluating the incidence of circulatory diseases as a cause of death in Grand Rapids, on which point he has been most clearly and courteously set straight by W. B. Prothro, M.D., public health director of Grand Rapids. He has presented no acceptable evidence that fluoridation is either dangerous, ineffective or undesirable .... His statements have, inevitably, been widely reproduced as a scientific opinion in opposition to fluoridation. If he claims to speak with scientific, rather than political authority, however, his attitude leaves much to be desired .... All (of the opponents of fluoridation) have laid much stress on the failure of the Delaney Committee to approve the principle of fluoridation of community water supplies. It is fair to state that many open-minded, genuinely inquiring persons with the ability to evaluate scientific evidence have been much impressed by the Delaney Report and such is the natural reaction to what purported to be a congressional hearing of scientific testimony. The Report itself is, we believe, very fair in intention. It reflects a clearly expressed sense of responsibility on the part of the members of the Committee not to reach a hasty conclusion nor one which might conceivably result in harm to the population of any community in the United States. The Report itself, however, is much fairer in tone than was the atmosphere of the Hearings, as a close reading of the latter makes obvious. A contentious attitude, particularly toward witnesses from the United States Public Health Service, seems to have been displayed by the Chief Counsel and by one of the members of the Committee and moved Representatives Paul C. Jones of Missouri and Walt .Horan of Washington, themselves members, to protest against a \"prosecuting\" attitude toward certain advocates of fluoridation. . . We would characterize the Report not as bad but as disappointing in that it: 1) failed to ':'\\ ( ... _:.:.;.::. FLUORIDATION OPPONENTS 1165 give due emphasis to the better evidence in the Hearings, and 2) sought for perfect and complete knowledge in a scientific field unlike that demanded of any other in which reliable data for day-to-day application are available. To deny the validity of the evidence for the safety of fluoridation today pending the completion and extension of experimental investiga\u00ad tions is to disregard what has already been learned and to introduce the concept of a conflict between practice and investigation which is not valid. Rep. Miller . . . is in factual error (in his separate report) in the notion that only persons under eight years of age will be benefited by fluoridation and he is guilty more than once of \"interpreting\" statements of the American Medical Association to derive meanings which are contrary to the accepted usage of the English language. ELECTRONIC MEDICAL FOUNDATION NATIONAL HEALTH FEDERATION (FRED J. HART) From a news release, December 22, 1961, by the US Department of Health, Educa\u00ad tion and Welfare, Food and Drug Administration: The Food and Drug Administration announced today institution of a criminal contempt of court action against the Electronic Medical Foundation, San Francisco, Calif., and Fred J. Hart, its president. The action charged the Foundation and Hart with violation of a 1958 court order prohibiting any further distribution of 13 types of medical devices which had been claimed to diagnose and treat hundreds of diseases based on \"emanations\" supposedly given off by a drop of dried blood sent in on a piece of sterile paper .... Fred J. Hart is also President of the \"National Health Federation,\" an organization which shares offices with the Electronic Medical Foundation and is devoted to such causes as defending use by drugless healers of dietary foods and devices of unproved efficacy, opposition to fluoridation of drinking water to prevent dental caries, and promotion of worthless cancer remedies such as the Hoxsey cure. From a speech by K. L. Milstead, deputy director, Food and Drug Administration, October 9, 1963: National Health Federation is headed by Fred J. Hart, its founder and only president .... This organization is waging a vigorous and often vicious campaign which misinforms, clouds issues and misleads consumers, legislators, and their own members, on '\\:\"here the best interest of the public lies. The principles of nutrition and health expressed by the Federation are not supported by present-day nutritional and medical experts: The organization has supported completely discredited medical treatments such as the Hoxsey Cancer Treatment .... From a memorandum of October 21, 1963, from the Food and Drug Administration: ... The National Health Federation was founded in 1955 by Fred J. Hart, shortly after he consented to a Federal Court injunction prohibiting him from making further shipments of 13 electrical devices which had been widely distributed for the diagnosis and treatment of disease .... He was prosecuted for criminal contempt of the injunction and on July 27, 1962, he was fined $500 by the U.S. District Court at San Francisco .... The stated purpose of the Federation is to promote \"freedom of choice\" in health matters. The record shows that what this frequently means is freedom to promote medical nostrums and devices which violate the law. From its inception, the Federation has been a front for promoters of unproved remedies, eccentric theories, and quackery .... DR. FREDERICK B. EXNER From the Florida Health Notes, January, 1956: ... Dr. F. B. Exner, speaking for the opposition declared in his verbal testimony that in the reports of the studies made by the Public Health Service \"facts have been warped, mis\u00ad represented and even fabricated.\" He charged that Professor A. P. Black's scientific publications contained \"statements carefully designed to deceive.\" Furthermore, those who have endorsed fluoridation (including America's outstanding bodies of scientists) have perpetrated \"what is 1166 J. AMER. DENT. ASSN.: Vol. 71, Nov. 1965 probably the greatest and most elaborate hoax in history.\" The Board (Florida State Board of Health) vigorously disagrees. The Public Health Service research has been acclaimed repeatedly by American physicians, dentists and scientists for its classical design, precise execution and sound conclusions. The Board has secure confidence in the integrity of the scientists concerned, individually and as a group. They note also that the dentists who have participated most actively in \"perpetrating\" the alleged \"hoax\" are those who stand to lose economically from the improvement of dental health which they seek to attain. Dr. Exner repeatedly pointed to variation in intake of fluorides due to differences in indi\u00ad vidual consumption of water, as a major disadvantage of the fluoridation of water supplies. The proponents, however, introduced as evidence detailed data on the distribution of fluorides in food and water, and their absorption and excretion by the body. The amount taken in foods varies with selection. Sea foods, in general, have a high content of fluorides (commonly 4 to 10 tpm / parts per million/) . Meats ( as steak, chops, chicken), butter, cheese and bread have a moderate level (commonly 1-2 ppm) while fruits and vegetables are variable (commonly less than 1 ppm). The amount taken in water varies with level and consumption. Of the fluorides ingested, a portion is absorbed, the remainder is discharged in the fecal waste. That absorbed is discharged in the urine and sweat. The fluoride level in the urine is closely similar to that in the water consumed. On drinking increased quantities of water, there will be an increased intake of fluorides, but promptly thereafter (within 1 to 3 hours) there will be an increased output of both water and fluorides through urine and/or perspiration. Even with an intake of two to three times that provided by an average diet and water with 1 ppm fluorides, the approximate balance of intake and output has been demonstrated by quantitative chemical determinations. Evidence of significant accumulation was obtained only when there was excessive intake. Experimentally \"when F (fluoride) levels up to 50 ppm were given in a ration no skeletal changes were found.\" The Board failed to find any scientific evidence to even suggest that there would be, or h11d been any abnormal or undesirable accumulation of fluorides with intake in a general diet and in water with fluorides even substantially above the level recommended for fluoridation. From an editorial in the Chicago Daily News, January 25, 1956: A Seattle (Wash.) physician* told a city council committee that \"there is no shred of scientific evidence\" to support claims that fluoridated water will protect teeth from decay. We hope he is a better physician than he is a logician. For what he must mean is that he never saw any such evidence. It is hardly likely that he has examined all the evidence in the world, to be sure that none of it sustained the merits of fluoridation. If he says he is ignorant of such merits, we will believe him. In the meantime we will believe that the judgement of leading medical societies, the US Public Health Service, and the experience of leading communities, including Evanston (Ill.), is a more trustwort hy guide to the truth. *Referring to Dr. F. B. Exner, who, however, was not named in the editorial. From The Journal of the American Dental Association, April, 1956, \"Recent Studies on Medical Aspects of Fluoridation,\" Wallace D. Armstrong, MD, PhD: ... Exner (Northwest Medicine, July, 1955) has given an extended statement of the grounds for his opinion that the health safety of fluoridation is unproved. He considers that the intake of fluoride ought to be individualized, he attacks the methods and observations of several investigators who have endorsed fluoridation, and he states his impression as a roent\u00ad genologist that skeletal abnormalities due to fluoride are common in the United States. On the latter point two recent reports* [See footnotes] of extensive roentgenological studies of the skeleton have reinforced the prior published evidence that the prolonged use of water con\u00ad taining fluoride, even when of higher fluoride content than that required for optimal dental benefits is without significant or frequent effects on the structure of the bones and produces no alteration of skeletal function. *Leone, N.

From article entitled \"Fluoridatio n Winner In Court Reward Case,\" in February 4, 1957, Centralia-Chehalis, Washington , The Daily Chronicle: FLUORIDATION OPPONENTS 1167 Fluoridation has won an outstanding victory from a Lewis county superior court trial held last August, it was .disclosed Monday in a memorandum opinion entered by Superior Judge John J. Langenbach. The court dismissed with prejudice the suit of Dr. F. B. Exner, Seattle, against the Chehalis Fluoridation League. The action means the Seattle man has no further recourse on the issues .... In the trial, which was an action for breach of contract, Dr. Exner sought to prove that fluorides are harmful when added to drinking water. The court said, in one conclusion, Dr. xner had failed to meet the burden placed upon him to sustain the cause of his action. From a review of The American Fluoridation Experiment in the Rocky Mountain Medical Journal, October, 1957, by Dr. Frederick S. MacKay: ,a This is one of the most peculiar books ever to be offered for serious consideration, either by scientists or lay persons. Both of the authors are of accepted standing in the medical profession. In the present instance this book plunges into a subject that is only vaguely concerned with the .special practice of either of the authors .... There is hardly a paragraph in the book with which informed opinion could agree .... Toward the end of the book there appears a list of communities over the country that, once having adopted fluoridation, have, for various reasons, abandoned it; some after a considerable period of use. (This list, by the way, has several errors.) Had it not been that these communities were flooded with the same vicious and misleading material (as so generously set forth in the book), these communities would be receiving the benefits of fluoridation. A victorious achievement, indeed. But, what of the victims: the children-the future adults. The whole purpose of this book is to maliciously yscredit fluoridation. From the Royal Society of Health Journal, May-June, 1958, a review of Doctor Exner's book, The American Fluoridation Experiment: ... This book cannot be recommended to the reader in search of an objective evaluation of fluoridation although it will certainly offer an attraction to those interested in the extremes of subjective criticism. From Time Magazine, March 24, 1961, an article entitled \"Fluoridation Fails Again\": In the key Wellesley campaign, the chief opponent was the Rev. Andrew G. Rosenberger, 42, a retired Unitarian clergyman who grew rich selling \"nature foods,\" and is currently awaiting trial on a federal charge of misbranding products. . . . Throughout the campai gn Rosenberger kept in telephone contact with Seattle Radiologist Frederick B. Exner, anti-fluoridation strategist, lecturer and pamphleteer .... From Master in Chancery's Notice in the case of Alice Schuringa et. al., vs. City of Chicago etc., et. al., August 21, 1961: ... Plaintiffs called a total of five expert witnesses upon the scientific and technical issues . . . . In the opinion of the master, only Dr. Frederick B. Exner and Dr. George A. Waldbodt [sic] can qualify within the range of the word expert .... . . . Dr. Waldbodt [sic] is a qualified physician who has specialized in radiology. Dr. Exner has made a detailed and careful study of the fluoridation program but this has been limited to a reading of published articles and results. Unfortunately, however, for plaintiffs' position, neither of these men has done any research of any kind of the effect of fluoridation on tooth cay and neither of them is a qualified dentist. . .. f/ From Archives of Internal Medicine, 109:771, June, 1962. Review by William B. Bean, MD, of Doctor Exner's book, Fluoridation. Its Moral and Political Aspects: A New and Comprehensive Study: . . . The Pied Piper of. Hamlin, the dancing mania, certain elements of the Crusades, religious wars, the bwning of witches, tortures for heresy, and the self-mutilations of Corbyan\u00ad tian orgies are somber historic illustrations that \"The capacity of the human mind to deceive itself knows no limits.\" As a minor league or perhaps bush league example of a latter day instance of such tortured confusions and misconceptions the future may well look back on the paranoia provoked by such a simple problem as prophylactic fluoridation to reduce the 1168 J. AMER. DENT. ASSN.: Vol. 71, Nov. 1965 incidence of dental caries. Exner, aided and abetted by the Greater New York Committee Opposed to Fluoridation, symbolizes the testimonial approach which the most convinced zealot may mistake for evidence. This tract illustrates once more that freedom to criticize does not imply license and that righteous indignation, no matter how devout, does not establish accuracy or raise up the light of truth. DR. JONATHAN FORMAN (MEDICAL-DENTAL AD HOC COMMITTEE ON THE EVALUATION OF FLUORIDATION) From a letter from Bruce D. Forsyth, US Public Health Service, March 7, 1957: \u00b7 ... Apparently, a group of medical and dental people totaling about 300, who are opposed to water fluoridation, have formed an association called \"The Medical-Dental Ad Hoc Com\u00ad mittee on the Evaluation of Fluoridation.\" Members of this Ad Hoc Committee appeared at the March 6 hearings in opposition to fluoridation. Leading this group was Dr. Jonathan Forman of Columbus, Ohio, who stated that he was editor of the Ohio State Medical Journal. Dr. A. Allen London, a dentist, of Boonton, New Jersey, testified that he was secretary of this Ad Hoc Committee .... A representative of the American Medical Association testified that there are approximately 250,000 physicians in the United States, and a representative of the American Dental Asso\u00ad ciation testified that there are nearly 90,000 dentists in the United States, making a total of well over 3,000,000. Therefore, this Ad Hoc group represents less than one-tenth of one per cent of the physicians and dentists in the United States .... From \"A Layman Looks at Fluoridation\" by Hugh R. Jackson, President, Better Business Bureau of New York City, May 28, 1958: ... Let me cite another instance of a type of practice which is not only dishonest but which would be a distinct violation of law in this State if it were done in conjunction with any charitable or philanthropic appeal. I have seen and examined a pamphlet entitled A Statement on the Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies issued by the Medical-Dental Ad Hoc Committee on Evaluation of Fluoridationan antifluoridationist group-which was issued on February 20, 1957. On the inside cover and the back page of this pamphlet are printed a list of the names of 283 professional men, chiefly physicians, labeled as a \"partial listing'' of sponsors \u00b7of the statement. Forty-eight of the physicians listed in this group are from the City of New York .... Twenty-five of the 48 said that they were opposed to fluoridation and had given permission for their names to be used. Five more were opposed but had not given permission for their names to be used. Five of these physicians stated they had no opinion on the\u00b7 subject. Two refused to comment, one died in January, 1958, and seven were definitely in favor of fluori\u00ad dation. The remaining three had not been contacted by the time I received this report. This is indeed a sorry record insofar as the elementary rules of honesty and decency are concerned ... From a letter by directr, American Dental Association, Bureau of Public Informa\u00ad tion, May 28, 1959: The Medical Dental Ad Hoc Committee ... is headed by Dr. Jonathan Forman, a physician of Columbus, Ohio. Dr. Forman is known for his opposition to water fluoridation and was asked to resign his position as editor of the Ohio State Medical Association because of this. This action was taken by the Medical Association last October 15 .... GOLDA FRANZEN From Dental Health Memorandum, VS Department of Health, Education and Welfare, November 15, 1959: .Mrs. Golda Franzen, of San Francisco, nationally known for her antifluoridation activities, was given a six-month suspended sentence, placed on two years probation and fined $150 on each of two counts as charged. Mrs. Franzen and two men were convicted for violation of the California Pure Drugs Act relating to the advertising and sale of a cancer quack device. The two men were Emerson B. Hartman , a chiropractor, and Webster Billington, manufacturer of '., FLUORIDATION OPPONENTS 1169 the device. The defendants have appealed the case and posted an appeal bond. The investigation carried out over the past two years involved careful documentation of evidence in which patients had been diagnosed by Hartman as having cancer and then advised to purchas e and use a \"Film-O-Sonic\" vibrator device, an audible sound ray machine. This device, principally an ordinary tape recorder with speakers replaced by, grill pads, was made available through Mrs. Franzen or directly from Billington at prices ranging up to $500. It was revealed that this device had been sold extensively in California and other states. CARLTON FREDERICKS From Docket No. 4032 of 1944, New York Special Sessions Court, 100 Centre Street, New York City: Dr. Carlton Fredericks is a lecturer and radio speaker who has been introduced on the radio as an \"internationally known nutrition expert.\" He has .not taken courses either during his undergraduate or graduate studies which would qualify him as a nutritionist. At the University of Alabama, where he was registered as Harold Frederick Caplan, he had a two-hour course in physiology and eight hours of elementary chemistry. Later he attended the New York University School of Education and studied subjects such as education for democracy, social psychology, etc. Dr. Fredericks has a Ph.D. degree in physical education, health education, and recreation from New York University but under the New York Medical Practice Act, he would not be entitled to use the term \"doctor\" in connection with the public health. On March 13, 1945, Carlton Fredericks pied guilty in Special Sessions Court, New York City, on charges of unlawful practice of medicine after he had prescribed some liquid medica\u00ad tions for one investigator, and diets, vitamins, thyroid and benzedrine pills for another investigator of the Medical Grievance Commission of the New York State Department of Education. He was fined $500 and sentenced to three months in City Prison; prison sentence was suspended and the fine was paid. From a letter from Sidney Tartikoff, Assistant Attorney General in Charge Education Bureau, Department of La'w, State of New York, January 24, 1946: . . Our rei:ords indicate that Carlton Fredericks was convicted on his plea of guilty to a charge of practicing medicine without a license in this state. This charge arose out of the fact that he prescribed certain vitamins to persons for the definite purpose of effecting a cure of specific ailments. On April 3, 1945, defendant was sentenced to pay a fine of $500 which he paid and in addition, the court imposed a sentence of three months' imprisonment. The execution of the latter portion of the sentence was suspended .... From a letter from Bureau of Investigation, American Medical Association, May 31, 1961: . The record indicates, further, that (Carlton) Fredericks received the degree of M.A. in 1949 and Ph.D. in 1955, both from New York University, in public health. None of his formal education, therefore, appears to cover the field of scientific nutrition .... A few years ago Mr. (Carlton) Fredericks wrote a book entitled \"Eat, Live and be Merry.\" We asked one of the nutritionists on the staff of our Council on Foods and Nutrition to read the book and comment on it. We have received the following commentary: \"Carlton Fredericks seems to have some grasp of basic nutrition. However, in his book he distorts many of the facts and propounds his theories as proven facts. None of the statements in the book are substantiated by literature references. \"Although he does admit that no single food will prevent or cure anything, he violently opposes white bread and flour, sugar, and pasteurized milk and 'devitalized foods.' He recom\u00ad mends vitamin and mineral supplements for everything. \"Fredericks makes many statements in regard to the treatment of various diseases, such as atherosclerosis, common cold, asthma and anemia, that either cannot or have not been con\u00ad firmed by acceptable scientific investigation. He encourages self-diagnosis, although he does say that these conditions should be treated by a physician.\" In 1945 we were notified by New York authorities that Fredericks had pleaded guilty to the charge of practicing medicine without a license in New York. The case arose out of his prescribing certain vitamins to persons for the definite purpose of effecting a cure of specific ailments. -I 170 J. AMER. DENT. ASSN.: Vol. 71, Nov. 1965 We -regard Carlton Fredericks as a salesman of vitamin preparations, and presumably a good one. From The Journal of the American Medical Association, April 7, 1962, column on Medical News: ... Here are other enforcement actions reported by Dr. Larrick: \"Two court actions have been filed involving the writings and lectures of the self-styled 'nutritionist' Carlton Fredericks .... In one case, we seized some vitamin products on charges that they were misbranded by statements in the sales literature. . . . In the other case, we instituted seizure of 43 of the vitamin and mineral food supplements marketed by Foods Plus, Inc., a mail-order distributor. We are alleging that these articles are misbranded because of the representations made for them in Mr. Fredericks' radio lectures. . . . We charged that the products do not have adequate directions for treating many serious ailments referred to in Mr. Fredericks' radio lectures. . . . For example, in the lectures recorded in the Foods Plus case he recommended such treatment for respiratory and circulatory diseases, multiple sclerosis, sexual frigidity, cerebral palsy, heart trouble, and numerous other conditio_ns.\" From a speech before the Yonkers Academy of Medicine, Yonkers, New York, May 16, 1962, by K. L. Milstead, deputy director, Bureau of Enforcement, Food and Drug Administration: Carlton Fredericks is no stranger to you. He is a \"self-styled nutritionist\" who has been broadcasting over about 50 radio stations in this country, including one here in New York. He also publishes a diet book entitled, \"Eat, Live and Be Merry'' and other pamphlets and booklets on health subjects. Mr. Fredericks' basic theory is that all ailments of mankind are due to faulty diet and devitalized foods and all diseases can be successfully treated by taking vitamins and other food supplements. We have made two seizures of vitamin preparations based on misbrandings resulting from Mr. Fredericks' writings and his radio lectures. In addi\u00ad tion to charges based on false nutritional and therapeut ic claims, we also challenged his claim that he is \"America's Foremost Nutritionist.\" Actually, he has no formal or educational qualifications as a nutritionist. OLIVER KENNETH GOFF From article by Richard Graf, entitled \"Goff Assailed by Englewood's Civic Leaders,\" July 24, 1953, Denver Post: The Rev. Kenneth 0. Goff, Englewood evangelist, was bitterly denounced Wednesday by Englewood business, religious and civic leaders for his picketing of a \"Prayer for Peace\" meeting Sunday officially opening that city's golden jubilee celebration. Residents of the Denver suburb, including a city councilman, a leading businessman, the president of the school board and several ministers joined in terming Goff a \"rabble rouser,\" a \"publicity hound\" and a \"menace to the community.\" Goff and ten of his followers in the Colorado Anti-Communist league picketed the meeting 1n the Englewood high school field house to protest the presence of John A. Carroll, former U.S. congressman who was the featured speaker. Goff told reporters he and his supporters were picketing the meeting because of Carroll's \"left-wing views\" and support of the United Nations. The controversial minister, who was termed a \"professional agitator\" in 1947 by Mayor Newton's committee on human relations, drew down a barrage of scathing criticism for his action ... From editorial entitled \"Goff Scoffed Off,\" in July 24, 1953, Denver Post: Civic leaders of Englewood are to be congratulated on their prompt denunciation of the Rev. Kenneth O. Goff, the evangelist who Sunday night led a string of pickets against the \"Prayer for Peace\" program that opened Englewood's golden jubilee celebration. It is regrettable that another Goff attention-getting stunt had to mar the start of the jamboree, but characters like him just naturally must get into the act somehow. Goff not only showed shockingly bad taste when he tried to inject his political prejudices into the Englewood celebration scene. He also made himself look like something of a village FLUORIDATION OPPONENTS 1171 clown, with highly exaggerated hate for the United Nations, to which the American people through their government have overwhelmingly subscribed. U.N. doesn't hate Goff; but Goff just can't stand U.N. . . . Long a disciple of Gerald L. K. Smith, Kenneth Goff is one of the minor menaces among American hate-merchants. But all the little fellows of this profession aspire to national attention. The place to keep them trimmed down to size is on the home plot of ground. The people \u00b7of Englewood, we feel sure, are not going to be taken in by rabid nonsense, notoriety\u00ad seeking, and hysterically pitched appeals to the baser nature of man. From a letter from Department of Investigation, American Medical Association, May 24, 1961: ... We have reference in our files to (Kenneth or Oliver Kenneth) Goff as claiming to be a former Communist, and in his writings he claims to know all about them. In 1959 we were asked for information on a book entitled \"Brain Washing,\" said to have been written by Mr. Goff. This was described in an advertisement in the Defender Magazine for June 1958 on page 17 as follows: \"This book contains three divisions (1) a statement by its publisher, Kenneth Goff, (2) the course on psychological warfare taught in various countries by Soviet leaders, and ( 3) a lecture of psycho-politics by Beria. Prices: $1.00 copy; Six copies $5.00 postpaid. Defenders, Inc., Wichita, Kansas.\" The Defender Magazine was the enterprise of the late Gerald Winclro, and is classed generally as a \"hate\" type of publication, being anti-medical, anti-Communist, anti-Catholic, and anti-Jewish. Goff has been connected with this group, in the past, at least. In their medical activities, they have sponsored such useless cancer treatments as the Koch preparation (\"Glyoxylide\"), the Hoxsey treatment, and the \"Laetrile\" treatment. In the circumstances, if Mr. Goff opposes fluoridation, this would come as no surprise. LUDWIK GROSS From a memorandum, September 24, 1962, by the US Public Health Service, Divi\u00ad sion of Dental Public Health and Resources: Dr. Ludwik Gross, Chief of Cancer Research, for the Veterans Administration, states: \"The plain fact that fluorine is an insidious \u00b7poison, harmful, toxic and cumulative in its effect, even when injected in minimal amounts, will remain unchanged no matter how many times it will be repeated in print that fluoridation of the water supply is safe.\" He also opposed fluoridation on the grounds that the consumption of water varies greatly, that the margin of safety is narrow and that the engineering problems in large cities are formidable. The Veteran's Administration which employs Dr. Gross states: \"Dr. Gross is free to offer his personal opinion in any relation he may desire. However, Dr. Gross does not speak for the Veteran's Administration (J// the subject of fluoridation. This agency is not opposed to the fluoridation o& public water supplies.\" DR.V.O.HURME From Missouri Medicine, Journal of the Missouri State Medical Association, Feb\u00ad ruary, 1954: V. 0. Hurme, D.D.S., is research director, Forsyth Dental Infirmary, Boston, Mass., in which institution dental service is provided for children. He is the author of a paper entitled \"An Examination of the Scientific Basis for Fluoridating Populations\" and of a number of public statements questioning the advisability of fluoridation of water supplies. His article produces no evidence that fluoridation is either dangerous or ineffective. A study of his paper leaves the reader with the convictions a) that the author has failed to review the voluminous literature which gives concrete evidence upon points about which he confesses himself to be in doubt and b) that his use of such terms as \"mass medication\" and \"compulsory\" procedures reveal an emotional bias which casts doubt on his objectivity. A lengthy comment on points which Dr. Hurme has characterized as controversial has been made subsequently in the same publication by David B. Ast, D.D.S., director of the Bureau of Dental Health, New York 1172 J. AMER. DENT. ASSN.: Vol. 71, Nov. 1965 State Department of Health, who has been, unlike Dr. Hurme, long noted for his contributions to the scientific literature on this subject. Those who find themselves alarmed by Dr. Hurme's wish to delay fluoridation pending the establishment of criteria which he does not, himself, define should read Dr. Ast's rebuttal. To quote the latter verbatim, \"Many of the accepted public health procedures were generally applied with far less study and knowledge of the mechanism by which they worked or side reactions than is known about water fluoridation. I know of no public health procedure, including water chlorination, pasteurization of milk, or vaccination which has had the intensive and comprehensive study before it was applied as water fluoridation has had.\" KU KLUX KLAN From the Clinton (Tenn.) Courier News, May 16, 1957: A Ku Klux Klan rally was held Saturday night off Highway 25-W and Klan speakers attacked polio vaccination programs, fluoridation of water, Governor Frank Clement, the Supreme Court and President Eisenhower. . .. From Chicago Sun-Times, May 22, 1961: Montgomery, Ala. (AP)-Two bitterly rival Ku Klux Klan leaders-Robert M. Shelton and Alvin C. Horn-are among the defendants in a federal court injunction against bus violence ... Shelton, 31, a former rubber factory employee, was grand dragon of the U.S. Klans, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc., before he was ousted last year. He was replaced by Horn, a Talladega (Ala.) minister once indicted for murder .... Besides the usual KKK activities of fighting racial integration, Shelton also has been actively opposed to increased state appropriations for mental health and against fluoridation of drinking water, contending they have subversive aims .... DR. ROYAL LEE United States vs. Lee, 107F. 2d 522 (US Court of Appeals for the Senth Circuit, 1939), petition for writ of certiorari denied by US Supreme Court, (Dr.} Royal Lee, Trading as Vitamin Products Company, Petitioner, vs. United States of America, 309 US 659 ( 1940) . From the opinion of the Court of Appeals, written by Circuit Judge Otto Kerner: The defendant, Royal Lee ( trading as the Vitamin Products Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin) appeals from a judgment which pronounced a sentence upon him after conviction by jury. In four counts, the indictment charged him with the interstate shipment of his product \"Catalyn\" . . . and with the misbranding of Catalyn, thereby violating Sections 2 and 8 of the Food and Drug Act .... Counts 1 and 3 of the indictment charged that certain representations, pertaining to the curative and therapeutic effect of Catalyn and printed on the bottle labels, wrappers and enclosures, were false and fraudulent. . .. In this regard, it was alleged that by these means defendant intended to deceive buyers and to create in their minds the impression that Catalyn contained ingredients effective to cure, mitigate, or prevent over fifty enuumerated ailments, e.g., dropsy, goiter, heart trouble, and stomach ulcers. Counts 2 and 4 of the indictment charged that certain statements pertaining to the contents or ingredients of Catalyn were false and misleading .... In this connection, it was alleged that the particular information ,on the bottle labels indicated falsely that Catalyn contained definite proportions of the various vitamins . , .. The defendant was tried before the jury and convicted on all four counts. The court imposed sentence and the defendant appealed therefrom .... The defendant's guilt was amply proved, and there is no reason why the judgment should not be affirmed. From the Milwaukee Journal, March 24, 1953: Another vociferous foe of fluoridation is Dr. Royal Lee, a graduate dentist who has never FLUORIDATION OPPONENTS 1173 practiced. Lee is a vitamin products jobber and a manufacturer of engineering products .... Lee is opposed to cooking in aluminum pans and to pasteurizing milk, besides being opposed to fluoridation .... Recently, Lee's address to a women's group in Lakeland (Fla.) was reprinted in the Amalgamator, the monthly publication of the Milwaukee section of the American Chemical Society. The editor reprinted the address to see what comment would be made by chemists. Dr. Gerald J. Cox, a biochemist and director of dental research at the University of Pittsburgh, who has done research in fluoridation, said this in a letter to the Amalgamator: \"I assure you that every point made by Lee can be met with many facts, and every twist he has given can be untwisted. His article is pure rubbish.\" From United States Federal Trade Commission Release, March 11, 1954 (Order 4733): Royal Lee, trading as Vitamin Products Co., 2023 West Wisconsin Ave., Milwaukee, has been ordered by the Federal Trade Commission to cease and desist from disseminating false advertisements concerning the nutritional and therapeutic properties of medicinal preparations, including various vitamin products. The order directs the respondent to discontinue representing that his vitamin preparations designated Catalyn, Vitamin A Complex, Vitamin B Complex, Vitamin C Complex and Vitamin D Complex constitute competent nutritional or corrective treatment for prevention or cure of numerous and diverse diseases and ailments enumerated in his advertisements. The order also prohibits the respondent from representing that his other vitamin preparations designated Vitamin E Complex, Vitamin F Complex and Vitamin G Complex are competent nutritional treatment for or preventive of many conditions and ailments listed in his adver\u00ad tising matter. With respect to vitamins generally, the respondent is ordered to cease and desist from representing that a synthetic vitamin is incapable of curing or relieving diseases or symptoms of vitamin deficiency as effectively as a like vitamin obtained from the respondent's prepara\u00ad tions; or that any recognized scientific or medical publication contains statements or conclusions concerning the effects of vitamin deficiencies or the effectiveness of vitamins in the treatment of diseases or conditions, which statements or conclusions are different in import from those actually contained in such publication. Other medicinal preparations sold by the respondent are designated V.P. Organic Mineral Tablets, Cerol, V.P. Phosphade, Viable Acidophilus Yeast and Cerodyn (also known as Cerolyn and V.P. Fortified Wheat Germ). The Commission found that certain representations made in the respondent's advertisements concerning the effectiveness of these preparations in the treatment of various ailments and conditions were false and misleading and ordered such representations discontinued. From The Journal of the American Medical Association, April 7, 1962, column on Medical News: . . . Royal Lee, who for many years has been one of the leading sources of nutritional quackery in this country, has pleaded no contest in a criminal action at Milwaukee and is awaiting sentence for distributing misbranded vitamin and proprietary remedies. He has also consented to an injunction which will stop further distribution of more than 115 products claimed to be good for some 500 different diseases and conditions .... From the Milwaukee Journal, April 24, 1962: Royal Lee was placed on three years' probation and his Vitamin Products Company . . . was fined $7,000 ... by Fedral Judge Robert E. Tehan on charges of sending misbranded drugs in interstate commerce .... Lee, a 1924 graduate of Marquette University's dental school, was fined $800 and ordered to pay $4,006 court costs in' 1939 upon conviction for misbranding his products. In 1941 and in 1946 he was ordered by the federal trade commission to stop \"disseminating false advertisements concerning the nutritional and therapeutic prop\u00ad erties of medicinal preparations.\" DR. E. A. McLAUGHLIN From a letter of March 7, 1963, by Joseph E. Cannon, MD, director of health, Rhode Island Department of Health: 1174 J. AMER. DENT. ASSN.: Vol. 71, Nov. 1965 ... Some of the allegations attributed to Dr. E. A. McLaughlin, one of the former Directors of Health of Rhode Island, are as follows: (a) ... that children have just as many cavities now as other children before the water was fluqridated. (b) That he has seen more cases of gastroenteritis than ever before; that he is convinced that ... may well be due to fluoride in the water. (c) That ... adults should not be exposed to the dangers which accompany the indiscriminate addition of sodium fluoride to the public drinking water. ( d) Chronic fluoride poisoning results in impairment of bone and soft tissue in children and adults. ( e) The danger of poisoning is heightened by human or mechanical failure in the operation of the system by which fluoride is added to the water. In. refuting the allegations made by Dr. McLaughlin, the following facts are presented item by item. (a) ... it has been demonstrated that there has been a steady decrease in the amount of dental decay among the school children. In some instances as much as 65%. (b) Health data . . show no problems, conditions. or diseases which directly or indirectly can be attributed to theuse of controlled fluoridation .... (c&d) ... no scientific data has been produced to substantiate such claims. . . . ( e) Years of experience in drinking handling do not sub\u00ad stantiate these <:!aims .... DUON H. MILLER From a paper presented by Perry Ottenberg, assistant professor, Department of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania Medical School: The pamphlet, leaflet, handout bills and sticker literatur e is a tremendous one running into the millions. A typical example is \"Little White Coffins,,, put out by a group called Polio Prevention in Coral Gables, Florida, whose founder and backer is Duon H. Miller. Many of his pamphlets describing polio vaccination as \"anti-Christ, sneaking attempt to violate the bodies of innocent children with (Jewish) Salk vaccines,\" have turned up at P.T.A.'s, school boards, health departments, in mail boxes of apartment houses, etc. From a memorandum from chief, Division of Dental Public Health US Public Health Service, August 20, 1956: Duon H. Miller, Coral Gables, Florida, is a cosmetic manufacturer and operates Polio Prevention, Inc. Food and Drug Administration has brought four actions against him and his firm. He was fined $1,000 by Judge Emmet Chase of the Miami Federal District Court for conducting a post card campaign against the Salk vaccine in which he stated that \"thousand s of little coffins will be used to bury victims of Salk's heinous and fraudulent vaccine.\" For years he has campaigned against soft drinks, white sugar, white flour, and pasteurized milk. NATURAL FOOD ASSOCIATES (JOE D. NICHOLS) From a speech, October 9, 1962, by K. L. Milstead, deputy director, Food and Drug Administration: ' Natural Food Associates is headed by Joe D. Nichols, MD, its organizer and only president. . . His organization is a leading advocate of the use of \"natural \" foods and a foe of all processed foods, fluoridation of water, use of commercial fertilizers and pesticides. It is the basic philosophy of this group that all mental and metabolic diseases are caused by commercially produced foods .... From The Wheat Flour Institute Reports, January, 1963: Dr. Frederick J. Stare, nutritionist, writer and head of the Department of Nutrition, School of. Public Health, Harvard University, has been cleared of libel charges brought by the Boston Nutrition Society ... a suit was filed against Dr. Stare in the Norfolk County Superior Court, Dedham, Massachusetts. In the trial, Dr. Joe D. Nichols of Atlanta, Texas, testified against Dr. Stare. Dr. Nichols owns a half interest in a hospital and a part interest in a health food store. He is vice chairman of the Committee on Nutrition of the Texas Medical Association, and head of an organization called Natural Food Associates .... During the trial, Dr. Nichols admitted he wrote the statement circulated by the Boston Nutrition Society. In questioning the Texas practitioner said that in his opinion multiple sclerosis is due to a dietary deficiency. He said, however, that he had seen but one case in his period of practice. The court respondedFLUORIDATION OPPONENTS 1175 to Dr. Nichols' testimony by saying, \"What a fake that was.\" The jury found Dr. Stare not guilty after a short period of deliberation. CHARLES ELIOT PERKINS From a letter from Dr. Thomas L. Hagen, chief of the Division of Dental Public Health of the US Public Health Service, January 29, 1954: .Mr. (Charles Eliot) Perkins is the author and publisher of the pamphlet entitled, \"The Truth about Water Fluoridation.\" In the foreword of this book Mr. Perkins claims to be \"one of the few scientists with a thorough knowledge of fluorides\" and that he is \"internationally known for his original discoveries in the field of cancer research.\" Mr. Perkins uses no degree after his name and as far as is known has done no research. He has authored two books on cancer, \"The Conquest of Cancer\" and \"What Price Civilization.\" In a review of the latter book, the American Cancer Society says, \"this volume presents a mass of undocumented theories .... \" We have been unable to locate any contribution Mr. Perkins has made to rep\u00ad utable cancer journals such as the American Journal of Cancer, Cancer Research, and the Journal of the Cancer Institute. Mr. Perkins states that he is a biochemist and a physiologist yet we have likewise been unable to locate any contributions he has made to the professional journals in those fields. He is not listed in American Men of Science, in the membership of the American Chemical Society or in the membership in the Society of Biological Chemists. In 1951 or thereabouts, Mr. Perkins obtained an interview with the laboratory chiefs and scientists of the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland. The Director of 'the Institute reported on this meeting and indicated that Mr. Perkins obviously was not what he pretended to be--an authority on cancer. In 1946 Mr. Perkins was press agent for a Washington hotel. He is presi\u00ad dent of the Fluoridation Education Society, P.O. Box 8036, S.W. Station, Washington, D.C. and president of the Charles E. Perkins and Associates , Biochemists , Washington. ' From Birmingham Post-Herald, April 8, 1954: There's a considerable doubt that Charles Eliot Perkins is the \"expert of fluoridation\" that he's claimed to be. Dr. George A. Denison, city-county health officer, disclosed a few facts about Perkins-cited as an authority by a local anti-fluoridation group in recent newspaper advertisements-yesterday at a meeting of Birmingham Lions Club. Quoting a letter from the American Medical Assn., he read: \"A clipping from The New York World, May 25, 1938, states that Charles Eliot Perkins, 50, who lived at 334 West 87th-st, in New York was in jail in default of $2,500 bail and awaiting trial on the charge of practicing medicine without a license. \"Five women inspectors of the Health Department said he diagnosed their cases, suggested treatment and accepted fees. Perkins said he was only a biochemist , however. \"He said that he had studied at St. Mary's College in Oxford, but the judge pointed out that there was no such college. Then Perkins said he had taken a correspondence course from Oxford while he was living in New Jersey.\" Quoting from a letter from the American Cancer Society, and signed by Dr. Charles S. Cameron, Dr. Denison read: ... \"I know that Mr. Charles Eliot Perkins uses the name of the American Cancer Society in a way that implies endorsement of his book 'What Price Civilization.' \"Nothing could be further from the truth. It so happens that we sent a purchase requisition to the publisher of this book since we thought it was necessary to be informed as to its contents in order to answer any inquiries which it might stimulate, and so far as I know, the fact that a book was sold to our library is the only basis of his reference to this society. \"I certainly know of no evidence which indicts fluorine as a cause of cancer nor as a stimulant to cancer growth .... \" Genkinger et al vs. City of New Castle Water Co., etc. In the Court of Common Pleas of Lawrence County, Pa. From the decision of Judge P. J. Braham (rendered March 4, 1955) : . . . The overwhelming weight of the evidence is to the effect that treatment of drinking water in the proportion of one part or 1.2 parts to one million will have a very beneficial effect on the teeth of the young and' may be done without danger to anyone. This is what the court 1176 J. AMER. DENT. ASSN.: Vol. 71, Nov. 1965 finds from the evidence. Charles Eliot Perkins, witness for the plaintiffs, was not convincing as an expert. The court may take judicial notice of the enormous advantage which had accrued to the public health from the work of devoted scientific men in laboratories, clinics and schools. In the great majority of cases this has been done by men thoroughly prepared, aware of the progress of .their science, and thinking of themselves as only workers with others in the ranks of that science. Mr. Perkins, on the contrary, with comparatively meager preparation, flouts ordinary procedures and recognized scientific men. His knowledge of the subject here in dispute is, like his cure for cancer, impulsive, erratic and unsound .... Dr. Perkins' belief that the use of fluorine in drinking water increases the incidence of cancer is completely answered by the testimony of Dr. Harry F. Bissel, an expert in the field of cancer, and of Dr. Thomas R. Uber, president of the Lawrence County Medical Society, each of whom testified that no importance is attributed to this factor in the top cancer research of the country. In like manner the fear that there would be an undue concentration of fluorine in the bones seems to be answered by the very scientists upon whom plaintiffs reply. In the brochure put out by the University of Mexico it is stated that no such result follows unless there are more than six points (parts) per million of fluorine in the water. Dr. Perkins' contention that fluorine in the body will seek calcium for which it has an affinity and will rob the body of calcium is answered by Dr. Cox who testified that there are one thousand times as much calcium in the water as fluorine when the proportions of one part to one million are maintained and by the testimony of B. French Johnson, chemist for the water company, who testified that the local water is rich in calcium .... PREVENTION MAGAZINE (J. I. RODALE) From a letter to Dr. Lon W. Morrey, editor, The Journal of the American Dental Association, from Oliver Field, Bureau of Investigation, American Medical Asso\u00ad ciation, May 6, 1954: This is in further reply to your telephoned request for information concerning Prevention Magazine. We do not regard this as a reliable source of information on nutrition and health. Many faddist preparations are advertised therein. None of these has any established merit in the treatment of disease. The publisher, J. I. Rodale, himself claims authorship of a good percentage of the articles appearing in the various issues that we have seen. His qualifications for such authorship are perhaps as unique as the magazine itself. In early promotional literature, Mr. Rodale was described as \"a prominent and wealthy manufacturer of electrical wiring devices such as fuse plugs and switches, which are distributed nationally and internationally. . . . Ever since he was a young man, Mr. Rodale was in search of the cause of illness, but could not find it. He searched widely through medical literature, but continued to observe increasing illness all about him without finding the remedy .. \" The New Yorker Magazine for March 7, 1953, on page 59, quoted an item from Prevention explaining its acceptance of advertising. This stated in part: \"We went for eight months without any advertising except one page in each issue of classified ads, offering unpoison-sprayed organically produced foods for sale. But in March 1951 we had to announce a change in policy. We had come to the conclusion that the cost of paper and printing being what it was, and that it being unpatriotic not to help pay off the Government's bonded debt (sic) by paying income tax, Prevention must take paid advertising.\" IONEL RAPAPORT From Utica, New York Observer Dispatch, June 4, 1963: Recently to refute a \"new\" objection-mongoloid births in relation to fluoridation-the Utica Health Dept. sent a telegram to the University of Wisconsin, where this undocumented state\u00ad ment was made by Dr. Rapaport, a former member of the staff of a psychiatric unit. Dr. Philip P. Cohen, professor of physiological chemistry, replied on ll4ay 31, 1963: \"I have no confiden ce whatsoever in the significance of the interpretat ion which Dr. Rapaport has given to his data. In reviewing this matter with him several years ago, he admitted that he had no true knowled ge of the actual fluoride exposure of the mothers. Rapapor t is not a trained scientist; he has been unable to get his material published in reputable journals and his requests FLUORIDATION OPPONNTS 1177 for support from NIH have been consistently rejected. ''I regret that Dr. Rapaport's totally unwarranted publication based on erroneous data has reflected on the standards of research at this University. However, I can assure you that his conclusions are totally without basis in fact.\" ... REV. ANDREW G. ROSENBERGER From Bristol (Conn.) Press, March 22, 1961: ... Well, up in Wellesley, Mass., the good people flocked to the polls and defeated fluoridation by a wide margin. The neighborhood towns of Newton and Brookline followed suit .... But the amusing feature of the Wellesley situation is that the chief opponent of fluoridation was the Rev. Andrew G. Rosenberger, He is a retired Unitarian clergyman who grew wealthy on selling certain \"nature foods.\" And, for the record, he is currently awaiting trial before a Federal court on a charge of misbranding his products .... From Time Magazine, March 24, 1961: ... In the key Wellesley campai gn, the chief opponent was the Rev. Andrew G. Rosenberger, 42, a retired Unitarian clergyman who grew rich selling \"nature foods,\" and is currently awaiting trial on a federal charge of misbranding products .... \"Fluoride is a poison,\" Throughout the campai gn Rosenberger kept in telephone contact with Seattle Radiologist Frederick B. Exner, anti-fluoridation strategist, lecturer and pamphleteer .... From a news release by the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Food and Drug Administration, June 27, 1962: A chain of health food stores doing a national mail order business and two of its officers have been convicted in Boston, Mass., on charges arising out of \"health\" lectures to promote food supplements for the prevention, treatment and cure of serious diseases .... Judge George C. Sweeney of the Federal District Court in Boston sentenced Henry K. Rosenberger, president and treasurer of Nature Food Centres, Inc., Cambridge, Mass. , and his brother Andrew Rosenberger, member of the firm's board of directors and lecturer, to $5,000 fines each and six month jail sentences . The jail terms were suspended and the brothers placed on two years probation. The Nature Food'Centres firm was fined an additional $10,000. ALONZO J. SHADMAN From a letter from Bureau of Investigation, American Medical Associatio n, February 19, 1959: ... According to our biographic information, Dr. (Alonzo J.) Shadman was born in 1877 and was licensed to practice medicine in Massachusetts in 1905, after obtaining a diploma from Boston University School of Medicine (then a homeopathic institution). He is not shown\u00b7as a member of the Massachusetts Medical Society. In 1943, Dr. Shadman was president of an organization known as the \"Academy of Certified Therapeutic Specialists, Inc.,\" which at that time was giving publicity to a \"new discovery in the treatment of arthritis\" consisting of \"live red ant serum,\" which was being promoted by some of the trustees of the \"Academ y.\" ... GERALD L. K. SMITH From the Milwaukee Journal, March 14, 1954: Delavan, Wis.,-A flood of propaganda linking fluoridation of drinking water with com\u00ad munism is being received in this city which will soon hold a referendum on whether fluoridatio n should be continued. Some of the letters and pamphlets to local residents bear the signature of Gerald L. K. Smith. . . . One of the to fluoridation as \"the crime of the century.\" It said that fluoridation was known in Communist circles as \"a vehicle of Red warfare to be used for outright poisoning of the population \" and \"for reducing the men\u00ad tality and will of the population so it will not resist communism.\" ... Smith, 56, was born at 1178 J. AMR. DENt. ASSN.: Vol. 11, Nov. 196S Pardeeville, Wis., and ... later became a follower of Gov. Huey P. Long of Louisiana and helped to organize Share the Wealth clubs .... In 1936 a March of Time newsreel referred to him as the \"number one rabble rouser of the United States ... a national figure with the makings of a fascist dictator.\" From Newsweek Magazine, December 4, 1961: SMITH: A blustery ex-Baptist Minister named Gerald L. K. Smith, who once publicly prayed \"God, make me a rabble-rouser,\" crested the wave of isolationist frenzy in 1937 with his nationwide Committee of One Million. While disclaiming anti-Semitism, his slogan was \"Christ First in America.\" From Look Magazine, July 16, 1963, an article entitled \"The Rampant Right\": . . . In this superheated situation, even the old-fashioned demagogues see opportunity. Jew-baiter Gerald L. K. Smith has popped up, active again. Smith's monthly, The Cross and the Fl:ag, advises followers to infiltrate Birch chapters in search of members who will add the Jews to their list of Red conspirators. . . . DAN SMOOT From The Far Right by Donald Janson and Bernard Eismann, McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., 1963, pages 134-135: . . . Dan Smoot readily admits being guilty of what his opponents call \"extremism.\" The well-spoken former FBI agent from Texas says, \"I equate the growth of the welfare state with socialism and socialism with Communism.\" From the May 27, 1957, Dan Smoot Report: ... Communists approve of fluoridation, and the reasons are obvious. If you can establish the practice of giving mass medication to the people through public water supply systems, how easy will it be to start introducing tranquilizing drugs into the water-to make people placid. and amenable to control and authority: to improve their mental health, in other words? DR. LEO SPIRA From a letter to Dr. Henry F. Helmholz, emeritus professor of pediatrics, Mayo Clinic, from S. Wright, Middlesex Hospital Medical School, London, England, July 26, 1954: Thank you for your letter of the 21st July about Dr. Spira and his book which I have not seen. I get a good many inquiries about Dr. Spira and so I should like to make my relationship to him clear. He worked in my laboratory for a PhD thesis in Physiology (not in Medicine) on the effects of fluorine in rats. This work was carefully carried out and the results were put in the PhD thesis which was accepted by the University of London. He did no clinical work at all in connection with this thesis, and any clinical claims that he makes are presumably based on clinical studies which he has carried out elsewhere. He did observe various toxic effects in his animals and they suggested that toxic effects might be produced in man. His experimental work, however, gives him no justification for stating what concentration fluorine would be toxic, or what the clinical changes might be. Dr. Spira's statement that I gave him \"the sorely needed chance of finding out whether the results of my previously recorded clinical observations on man were correct \" is therefore not an accurate statement of the position. He must make his claims about the clinical results of the use of fluorine entirely on clinical studies, of whose value clinicians only would be competent to judge. From a report by Dr. J. Roy Doty, secretary of the Council on Dental Therapeutics of the American Dental Associatio n, May, 1955: Dr. Leo Spira's book, \"The Drama of Fluorine, Arch Enemy of Mankind,\" is published by the Royal Lee Foundation. [See comments on Royal Lee.] One may readily gather that many of the claims which Dr. Spira makes demonstrate a lack of logic and non-adherence to standards of scientific investigation. FLUOR I DAT ION OPPONENTS 1 179 He endeavors to convince his readers of this theory by quoting himself as his authority. He says \"the endemic \u00b7nature of chronic fluorine poisoning in this country (England) was dem\u00ad onstrated when Spira ( 1928) first described a symptom-complex the origin of which he traced chemically to drinking water and aluminum cooking utensils.\" His statement \" ... that fluorine was the causative agent ... on account of its contaminatin g food prepared in aluminum cooking utensils . . .\" represents a most remarkable chemical concept. Unless Dr. Spira has found the \"philosopher's stone\" so long sought by alchemists, it is difficult to understand how the aluminum is transformed into fluorine. He may be confused into thinking that fluorides accompany the aluminum since fluorides are employed in the preparation of aluminum metal from its ore! It is also noteworthy that Dr. Spira again asserts that the aluminum itself is toxic. This in spite of the many careful studies by other investigators to demonstrate the lack of harm from use of aluminum utensils. In a letter to the editor of the New York Times, published August 27, 1952, and in other instances, Dr. Spira implied that his \"experimental research on animals\" indicates that fluorides at a level of 1 part per million are toxic. In order to investigate the basis for this claim, a number of Dr. Spira's articles published in scientific journals were collected and examined in some detail. In no instance was evidence presented of harm from fluorides in amounts com\u00ad parable to those which might be obtained from drinking water bearing fluoride at a level of 1 part per million. In fact, toxic effects were noted only when the concentration of administered fluoride was several hundred times as high as that employed in municipal fluoridation programs. Dr. Spira apparently assumes that a substance that is toxic in high doses must of necessity also be toxic when ingested in very small amounts of low concentration. One wonders how he would explain the fact that humans require small amounts of vitamin A although it has been demonstrated repeatedly that an intake of this vitamin several hundred times the required amount will produce serious toxic effects. The. bibliography of the Report of the United Kingdom Mission, which made extensive studies of fluoridation, fails to list a single reference to Spira's work although the majority of his papers were-published in England. In 1952 the National Research Council published a 565 page book with 2,016 references entitled \"Survey of the Literature of Dental Caries.\" One chapter of 90 pages was devoted to \"Fluorine and Dental Caries,\". and\u00b7 the background of fluorine was carefully presented. None of Dr. Spira's numerous papers were mentioned in this bibliography. DR. ALFRED TAYLOR From the Texas Dental Jo\u00b5rnal, September, 1951: A two-day investigation (of Alfred Taylor's work) was made personally by two of the out\u00ad standing authorities of the National Institute of Health, Dr. H. Trendley Dean and Dr. H. B. Andervont. Following this investigation, Dr. Dean wrote the following letter to the Texas State Dept. of Health .... \"Dr. Howard B. Andervont and I have carefully evaluated the data in respect to the alleged relation of fluoride water to an accelerated rate in the . development of mammary tumors and are of the opinion that the evidence adduced does not !warrant any modification in the policy [of the US Public Health Service] of recommending fluoridation of public water supplies for the partial control of dental caries.\" From a letter to the director of dental health, State Department of Health, Austin, Texas, from Chauncey D. Leake, vice-president of the University of Texas, Medical Branch, Galveston, October 1, 1951: It is greatly to be regretted that Dr. (Alfred) Taylor's conclusions ( that fluorides were connected with cancer) were so widely disseminated without full appreciation of all facts involved .... It seems to me that every effort should be made to convince public health officials throughout this country that there is no contraindication (evidence opposed) to fluoridation of drinking waters for the purpose of reducing dental caries. From a letter to a Texas physician by Dr. Charles S. Cameron, president of the American Cancer Society, 47 Beaver St., New York, NY, April 10, 1953: No valid scientific evidence known to the Society supports a causative relationshi p of fluorine (specifically in amounts used in water fluoridation for the purpose of dental caries prophylaxis) 1180 J. AMER. DENT. ASSN.: Vol. 71, Nov. 1965 to cancer. On the contrary such epidemiological and laboratory experimental data as are available indicate no such relationship. MRS. LILLIAN VAN De VERE President, Connecticut Pure Water Association and Citizens' Committee against Fluoridation From The Hartford (Conn.) Courant, February 13, 1955: .Miss Lillian Van deVere, a sell-appointed expert in various fields of science, is at it again\u00ad this time in New Haven ... Health directors and selectmen have already received copies of Miss Van deVere's litera\u00ad ture alleging that sodium fluoride is \"rat poison\" and injurious to liumans when used in water. To back her claims, the Hartford woman includes a biography of herseH listing her .qualifications. . . . In the printed biography, Miss Van deVere states that she is a \"medical research scientist who has performed scientific medical research experiments with sodium fluoride at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, using laboratory animals but not human beings.\" The truth of the matter, according to Dean Willard C. Rappleye, MD, of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, is that Miss Van deVere took only two short courses at the college, neither of which qualify her as an expert. In a letter to The Courant, Dean Rappleye said she \"registered in 1918-19 under the name of Miss Lillian D. Vilkomerson for two short courses in bacteriology. These were courses open to laymen and would give no one any knowledge to permit them to pose as an expert in the field of bacteriology.\" To further her claim as an authority on fluoridation, Miss Van deVere states she did \"post graduate \" work at Harvard University. Records now in the files of the State Health Department show she took a two-week course on how to take blood -counts at the Thorndyke Memorial Hospital, Boston. The course was designed for technicians and the hospital says, could in no manner be interpreted as \"post graduate \" study .... An investigation has failed to produce evidence that Miss Van deVere was ever graduated from high school or college. . . . In the biography .. .Miss Van de Vere states that she has had varied training and experience as a bacteriologist, serologist, biochemist, hematologist, clinical pathologist and pathologist. Here are the facts: She was employed by the State Health Department from March 17, 1941, to June 30, 1942, successively as a temporary junior serologist, junior microbiologist , assistant microbiologist and microbiologist. Her service ratings during the perioa, according to the State Health Department, were \"below average.\" The various titles she held were not the result of promotions, but simply of job reclassification, the department reports. At no time did she do any research work .... The only evidence produced thus far of her work in hematology is the two weeks' course she took at Thorndyke Memorial Hospital. No record of her work in pathology has ever been produced although she has claimed to be a pathologist ever since 1921. \u00b7That was the year .she married Harold Schwarm, a New Britain dishwasher posing as 'Dr. Reginald Van deVere.\" Schwarm, after their marriage masqueraded as the Prince de Chateroux de Bussigny de Bourbon in New York society with Miss Van df'Vere enacting the role of the \"princess \" until the hoax was discovered in 1923 .... When she applied for a position with the State Health Department in 1941, Miss Van de Vere stated in her written application that she did research in the department of pathology of the College of Physicians and Surgeons between 1914 and 1915. She was 14\u00b7 years old at the time .... DR. GEORGE L. WALDBOTT Statement by Dr. J. Roy Doty, secretary of the Council on, Dental Therapeutics of the American Dental Association, on a circular by Dr. George L. Waldbott, entitled \"Medical Evidence Against Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies\": It may be noted that a serious charge can be directed at the circular because\u00b7 of the inaccu-FLUORIDATION OPPONENTS 1181 racy with which it reports the context of medical literature and that relating to physiology . The errors are so profound that it is difficult to believe that the writer, a physician, could have had the original articles before him for examination at the time of writing the circular. The following examples may be verified by direct comparison of the circular and the original publications: ( 1) Assertion in the Circular (page 6) : \"In a twenty-two year old soldier reported by Linsman and McMurray, whose death was due to naturally fluoridated drinking water .... \" Original publication: \"A careful examination of the article reveals that the authors do not ascribe the patient's death to fluoride. Death was attributed to the result of severe kidney disease caused in part by infection.\" \"The pyonephrosis probably followed the local infection at the sternal biopsy site which provided a portal of entry. \"The fluorine may have played some role in the anemia but it must be concluded on the basis of the pathological findings that the anemia and its lack of response to therapy was primarily on the basis of the uremia present.\" (Linsman and _McMurray. Fluoride osterosclerosis from drinking water. Radiology 40:474-84, 1943.) The authors speculate on the possibility that fluoride ingestion might \"have aggravated existing kidney lesions\" but they point out that the only reports of such kidney damage were \u00b7 \"in severe chronic fluoride intoxication .... \" (2) Assertion in the circular (page 6): \"In a publication attesting to the absence of toxicity from a 1 ppm (parts per million) concentration of fluorides in water, the only reference to danger is a plea that patients with kidney disease buy nonfluoridated water. . . .\" Original publication: The author makes no such plea that might represent the apprehension implied in the circular. The original puolication states: \"In the unlikely event that evidence of the occurrence of fluorosis should be found in patients with chronic nephritis who have used water with no more than 1 ppm, it should be possible for physicians who discover such disease to advise their patients to use nonfluoridated water which could readily be made available for their use. No evidence exists that water-borne fluoride has been a cause of nephritis.\" (Heyroth, F. F. Toxicological Evidence for the Safety of the Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies. Am. J. Public Health 42: 1568-75, Dec., 1952.) From the Milwaukee Journal, November 8, 1955: .. Dr. (George L.) Waldbott, presented as an expert witness by opponents of fluoridation, charged that fluoridation was \"the greatest scandal in medical history. \" Dr. (E. R.) Krumbiegel (Milwaukee health commissioner) challenged him to prove it . . . . Dr. Waldbott said he had evidence of 55 cases of \"poisoning'' among persons who had been drinking fluoridated water. He said that one case was that of a Milwaukee man who wrote to. him complaining about a wide variety of symptoms. Dr. Waldbott described himself as \"a physician who has the highest standing\" among his colleagues and \"the highest esteem\" of his patients. He said he had published 125 papers on scientific subjects. He said that he was ,the first person to describe allergic pneumonia as a disease, and said he was the first to demonstrate the role of pollen in allergy. He charged that the United States public health service and the American Dental Association (ADA) had promoted fluoridation of water supplies without knowing what they were doing, He charged that the two organizations had conspired to prevent doctors who noticed cases of fluoride poisoning from having reports published in medical journals. Symptoms of fluoride poisoning, he said, were: Mouth ulcers, stiffness of the spine, general weakness, numbness in the hands, inability\u00b7 to concentrate and eye damage. 1n\u00b7 describing the case of the Milwaukeean, a mailman, Dr. Waldbott said that the man suffered from most of the symptoms but when he switched to spring water he noticed a remarkable improvement. Dr. Krumbiegel criticized Dr. Waldbott for making a diagnosis of \"poisoning '' on the basis of a letter. He said that the city was willing to take such an individual as the mailman, put him in a hospital without cost and do tests to determine whethe r there was \"poisoning.\" Dr. Krumbiegel also attacked Dr. Waldbott's \"references.\" \"Dr. he expected no favors,\" Dr. Krumbiegel said, \"so I'm going to take him at his word. After his opening self-serving statements, he went on to say that he was the first to describe allergic pneumonia and the first to demonstrate the role of pollen in allergy.\" Dr. Krumbiegel said that \"a Dr. Loeffler\" was the first man to describe allergic pneumonia and that \"pollen in allergy was demonstrated when (Dr. Waldbott) was .walking around in short pants.\" l182J.AMER. DENT.ASSN.:Vol.71, Nov.1965 The Detroit physician (Dr. Waldbott) later said that he had described allergic pneumonia five years before Dr. Loeffler. Dr. Krumbiegel said that Dr. Waldbott was \"harboring a delusion and was badly mistaken \" when he said that getting an article published in a medical journal establish ed something as the truth. All publication of an article means is that the editor thinks it should be published, he said. He contradicted Dr. Waldbott's assertion that there had never been a meeting of doctors on the subject of fluoride \"poisoning.\" He said that he himself had attended such a meeting in Buffalo, NY, a year ago. Dr. G. J. Hildebrand, Sheboygan health commissioner, said that fluoridl!,tion was \"one of the great achievements in the field of public health; there's no doubt in my mind that fluori\u00ad dation eventually will become general.\" He said that in the nearly 10 years that Sheboygan water had been fluoridated tooth decay had been reduced by 65% in the younger age groups of children. Sheboygan was the first city in Wisconsin to fluoridate its water, in February, 1946. Dr. Hildebrand said that death rates in Sheboygan from various causes did not differ essentially from those in cities where water was not fluoridated or from those in the state as a whole. He said Sheboygan's 48 physicians last year issued a statement that they had noticed no adverse effect on any of their patients that could be attributed _to fluoridation. But they had noticed a marked decrease in tooth decay in children, he said. Dr. Francis Bull, director of dental educatio n for the state board of health in Madison, said that \"it's astounding that we have to get a doctor from outside the state to tell us that people here e walking around half dead,\" from fluoridation. He referred to Dr. Waldbott's remark that Milwaukeeans were being \"poisoned \" by fluoridation. He said that persons who opposed fluoridation were opposed to nearly all public health programs. He said that public health organizations which supported fluoridation had helped increase life span by 30 years in the last two generations. The same organizations, he said, would be the first to let the public know if fluoridation were not safe. Dr. J. B. Franklin, president of the Greater Milwaukee Dental Association, said that 700 dentists in the association and the 3,000 dentists in Wisconsin were on record in favor fluoridation. \"Dental decay stands next to the common cold in frequency,\" Dr. Franklin said. \"Decayed teeth afflict about 97% of the children.\" Dr. Delbert P. Nachazel, chairman of the fluoridation committee of the dental association, said that he had studied all the available scientific reports on fluoridation and \"there was never anything in the literature by Dr. Waldbott.\" \"Where was Dr. Waldbott when these fluoridation studies were going on?\" he asked. \"These studies are still going on and I have never seen anything he has written on the subject.\" Note: In a letter dated February 16, 1962, to the American Dental Association, commenting on the above newspaper report, Dr. George L. Waldbott states: At no time have I stated . that I was the first to discover the role of pollen in allergy as claimed. I stated that I was first to discover the role of pollen in chronic perennial asthma (Ann. Int. Med. 7:508, 1933). I also stated that I was first to describe allergic pneumonia. I was referring to observations originally published in Am. J. Dis. of Children 47:41, 1934, and subsequently Am. J. Ped. 6: 229, 1935: This disease is in no way connected with \"Loeffler's Syndrome.\" Furthermore, you imply that no reports about my research on fluoride have been published in the medical literature. (In a subsequent letter to the America n Dental Association dated March 21, 1962, Dr. Waldbott makes the statement that \"thirteen articles\" of his have been published in medical journals. ) From Florida Health Notes, January, 1956: ... The Board (Florida State Board of Health) has reviewed the clinical evidence of the cases of chronic fluorosis reported l;>y Drs. Smith and Waldbott. Diagnoses were unsupported by confirmatory laboratory findings. It was stated by Dr. Waldbott that chemica l analyses for fluorides were not done since chronic fluorosis could occur in those with little or much fluorides, an observation which does not conform with the general knowledge of inorganic poisons. There was no evidence that the diagnosis of chronic fluorosis represented the consensus of a group of FLUORIDATION OPPONENTS I 183 physicians. Since the subjective symptoms could arise from a variety of causes, the Board must agree with the physicians speaking for the proponents that the causes of these reported illnesses were undetermined. They note also the testimony of Dr. T. Z. Cason that throughout his career (which was long and distinguished) as a specialist in internal medicine in Jacksonville (Fla.), (a city with 0.7-0.8 parts per million fluorides occurring naturally in the water) he has never seen a case in which a diagnosis of chronic fluorosis was warranted. From Master in Chancery's Notice in the case of Alice Schuringa et al, vs. City of Chicago etc. et al, August 21, 1961: ... Plaintiffs called a total of five expert witnesses upon the scientific and technical issues .... In the opinion of the master, only Dr. Frederick B. Exner and Dr. George A. Waldbodt [sic] can qualify within the range of ... . . . Dr. Waldbodt [sic] is physician who has specialized in radiology. Dr. Exner has made a detailed and careful study of the fluoridation program but this has been limited to a reading of published articles and results. Unfortunately, however, for plaintiffs' position, neither of these men has done any research of any kind on the effect of fluoridation on tooth decay and neither of them is a qualified dentist .... . . . This witness (Waldbodt) [sic] conceded that he had no special training as a physiologist or as a biochemist. Also he had never conducted any research in connection with fluoridation of any public water supply. The doctor also testified that a certain portion of the population would show symptoms of fluorosis whether the water was fluoridated or not. The doctor testified that he had seen 50 individuals in his practice who had never had fluoridated water but who had developed the symptoms which the doctor described as fluorosis, apparently from .other sources .... \\ \\.
