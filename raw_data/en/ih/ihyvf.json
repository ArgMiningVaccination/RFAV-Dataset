This is a serious health alert as children born after April 2016, when the type-2 virus was withdrawn worldwide including in India, do not have immunity to this viral strain. The vaccines in question were manufactured by Ghaziabad-based firm Biomed and administered to children in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Telangana. The type-2 containing poliovirus vaccine was supposed to have been destroyed by the company. Its wrongful administering now means the type-2 virus has been reintroduced into the environment. The World Health Organization detected the virus in stool samples from UP. Now there's the risk of the virus mutating in a few months, complicating containment strategies. This is a serious blow to India's polio-free status and exposes regulatory failure. All drug samples are sent to the Central Drug Laboratory in Kasauli for testing. The type-2 containing poliovirus vaccine should have been detected then. While full force of the law should be applied against Biomed for this disaster - the company's managing director has already been arrested - the main challenge now is to identify the children given the type-2 containing vaccine, monitor the geographical spread of the virus, and implement contingency measures. That this episode comes on the heels of Johnson & Johnson's faulty hip replacement systems in India underlines weak checks and balances. While progress on many health parameters has been possible through programmes implemented in mission mode, the poliovirus vaccine case shows achieving select targets isn't enough. Without continual upgradation of monitoring, prevention and remedial systems, there is a real danger of slipping back on the health scorecard.
