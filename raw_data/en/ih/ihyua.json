Aloes John 19:39-40 Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds. They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths, according to the burial custom of the Jews. Aloe is a perennial plant with thick fleshy leaves full of gelatinous material that was used to embalm dead bodies in Egypt. And since aloe doesn't have a fragrance on its own, it was mixed with myrrh to offer perfume benefits. Myrrh aloe was used on the crucified body of Jesus Christ before it was wrapped in linen. Today, the aloe extract, also known as aloe vera gel, is known for various health benefits, including: - Detoxifying the body - Hydrating the sin - Boosting the immune system - Soothing arthritis pain - Lowering cholesterol levels - Soothes acid reflux symptoms - Promotes hair growth - Slows the aging process - Cooling and treating sunburns - Stabilizing blood sugar - Preventing kidney stones - Reducing high blood pressure - Lubricating the digestive tract and healing stomach ulcers - Fighting inflammation - Treating blisters, allergic reactions, insect bites, burns, eczema, psoriasis, wounds, and other conditions associated with inflammation. 2.

Cinnamon is obtained from the inner bark of different species of the genus Cinnamomum. In the Bible, it was used as an aromatic condiment. It was described as sweet-smelling and used as an ingredient in the holy anointing oil used to anoint the tabernacle and its vessels. In proverbs 7:17, King Solomon used it as a fragrance to perfume his bed. In the scientific world today, cinnamon has [been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4003790/) to provide antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic benefits.

Saffron is mentioned only once in the Bible, in the Song of Solomon, and within a garden context. Because there is no clear indication of its use, it's thought to have been treasured for its ornamental beauty. Today saffron is commonly used as a spice. It's also rich in antioxidants and other medicinal compounds that can boost good health, including: - Protecting against cancer - Improving eyesight - Boosting brain function - Promoting digestion - Healing wounds - Treating asthma - Improving arthritis 5.

Anise is an annual plant whose leaves, seeds, and stems were used for different purposes, including medicinal benefits.

Myrrh Mathew 2:11 And when they came into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.

Myrrh was a common ingredient in the holy anointing oil for consecrating kings, priests, and the tabernacle. It was also used for fragrance and for embalming dead bodies because it can kill bacteria and other microbes. Today, myrrh oil is primarily used to fight infections as it can increase white blood cells that help the body fight infections and other diseases. In fact, preliminary [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23961070/) show that myrrh can directly kill bacteria and stimulate the immune system to produce more white blood cells, which also kill bacteria. Myrrh can treat ulcers, indigestion, cough, colds, lung congestion, asthma, arthritis pain, leprosy, cancer, depression, insomnia, and spasms. 7.

Cassia is an essential oil that was used in the holy anointing oil. It has similar aromatic properties as cinnamon. Although not commonly used today, cassia can offer numerous benefits for natural hair care. 8. Frankincense Exodus 30:34-36 The Lord said to Moses: Take sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum, sweet spices with pure frankincense (an equal part of each), and make an incense blended as by the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy; and you shall beat some of it into powder, and put part of it before the covenant in the tent of meeting where I shall meet you; it shall be for you most holy.

In the Bible, it was used for ceremonial cleansing purposes. For example, God instructed the children of Israel to use a bunch of hyssop as a \"paintbrush\" to apply blood on their door posts. Today hyssop is [known](https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/hn-2114004#hn-2114004-how-it-works) as a power expectorant and can help relieve respiratory conditions like bronchitis, asthma, and coughs.
