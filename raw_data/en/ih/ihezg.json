The 1943 Case Report Case report of 11 children united by a \"profound inability to relate to others\" and an \"anxiously obsessive desire for the maintenance of sameness\" Kanner's Autism vs Autism Today Wrote numerous case reports 1943 -60s that eventually convinced his colleagues that autism was a distinct syndrome But also made sweeping assertions that would no longer be accepted today: No overlap between autism and intellectual disability Parents were as \"distinct\" as the children - typically white, professional, highly educated, and emotionally distant The \"Refrigerator Mother\" Era From the 1940s through the mid -1960s, autism was widely portrayed as the withdrawal of an infant into an internal \"fantasy world,\" in response to a cold and emotionally frigid mother The Infamous Dr Bruno Bettelheim Chicago Psychoanalyst, Director of Orthogenic School for Children, Public Intellectual and Author of Acclaimed 1967 book What were the alternatives? Life Magazine Article on early behavioral therapy, published May 7, 1965 The Great Parent Revolt Began with psychologist/father of autistic child: Bernard Rimland (1964 book) Parents wrote back! Formed what would become the Autism Society of America \u2014first of the powerful parent advocacy groups for autism Autism Transformed: 1965 -80 Reconstructed as a neurobiological rather than emotional disorder Diagnosis became codified in DSM -3 as checklist of symptoms in three domains: social interaction, communication, and rigid/repetitive behaviors But the question of how biology explained autism would fracture the autism world into two warring factions... \"Mainstream\" Autism Paradigm Viewed autism rooted in brain development - with strong genetic component With a \"spectrum\" of manifestations from mild \"Asperger's\" to severe Therapy promoted early detection and aggressive services (TEACCH, ABA, language, OT) UNC's Eric Schopler, founder of TEACCH program Mainstream Autism since 2000: The (Unfulfilled) Promise of Genomics Hopes that autism might be explained by a relatively small number of genetic variations were dashed We have instead identified 100s of variations, none exclusive to autism, and collectively explaining only a minority of autism cases Work is now exploring epigenetics, the introns, and neurodevelopmental pathways The \"Alternative\" Autism Paradigm Promoted by parents and \"dissident\" professionals Bernard Rimland's Autism Research Center 1967 Agreed autism was rooted in biology - but argued it included many disorders, some treatable with diet or supplements (like PKU) Launched DAN! Project 1995-2011 Bernard Rimland PhD and son Mark; the first psychologist to openly challenge the psychogenic paradigm ( Infantile Autism, 1964) The Defeat Autism Now! (DAN!) Project, 1995-2011 Became a powerful network promoted via web, conferences, and books Disseminated by a network of practitioners (less than half physicians) Promoted some 33 modalities for \"curing\" autism, including but not limited to: --Gluten and casein free diet meds The Autism \"Epidemic\" - and the Autism Vaccine Controversies Dr Andrew Wakefield, promoter of MMR/Autism linkage The Vaccine Controversies Refuted Numerous studies have examined both the MMR and thimerosal controversies - and failed to support any role for vaccines \"Vaccine Omnibus\" cases dismissed in courts in 2009 Andrew Wakefield exposed in media for research irregularities, barred from practice in UK in 2010 Why \"Alternative Autism\" persists Persistent skepticism towards medical expertise in autism community The (understandable) need \"to do something\" Parents need hope more than a microarray....and a clinical partner rather than a scientist Clip from 2003 documentary \"Refrigerator Mothers\" The Newest Autism Controversy? Neurodiversity Autism: Disability or Identity? High functioning people with autism have attacked both of the earlier autism paradigms Assert that autism is not a pathology to be \"cured\" - or to be prevented through prenatal screening How does this history play out in your office? Recognition Discussions with Parents Listening to Parents Despite the rising prevalence of autism, the average age of diagnosis is still around age 4 Limited diagnostic facilities are an important part of the problem But many parents report that their primary care practitioners played down their concerns Caveat: Parental anxiety over autism is still more common among the educated (reflecting composition of autism parent advocacy groups) Red Flags in Toddlers Language regression or delay associated with: No pointing to make requests by 15 months May instead pull caregiver by the hand No pointing to share interests by 18 months Not checking parents' facial expression in novel situations (contrast with separation anxiety) Red Flags: Age 24 - 36 months Language: may emerge, but not to communicate Delayed echolalia: repeating lines from TV/video Stereotypical play and behaviors: Rigid, repetitive rather than pretend play Might just push toy car back and forth, spin wheels for long time periods, lick or smell it Often love to flip light switches, run in circles, spin Tantrums triggered by unexpected changes in plan Screening: the M -CHAT 23-Question Screen form administered at 18 and 24 months visits (validated for 16 to 30 months) High Sensitivity --but high false positive rate The MCHAT R/F Includes a set of follow up questions, designed to clarify any failed response Results in far better positive predictive value: 54% of failures will have autism diagnosis 94% will have some kind of developmental delay But takes time... Example: Follow up for question #2 Referral after failed M -CHAT R/F Getting a Comprehensive Evaluation Ideally would include detailed interview, plus and formal developmental testing including an ADOS -2 Academic autism center, developmental pediatrician or neurologist, child psychologist, NC TEACCH In practice - it can be hard to obtain such evaluation in timely fashion Always refer to early intervention or preschool services to get services started CDSA/Preschool Programs This referral will connect the child to ongoing services and periodic evaluations, often at home Children under 3 will receive speech and OT In many counties, children approaching age three and older, with suspicion of autism may well receive autism evaluation and be offered placement in an autism -specific preschool program First Steps After the Diagnosis What if you deliver the news? First ask parent what they know about autism, before offering your interpretation Review the child's deficits and behaviors, including special abilities (positive side of autism \u2014memory, patterns, iphones and ipads !) Ask about their concerns - why this child? Is it mother's fault? What does the future hold? Take a generally hopeful stance and make clear you will be their partner Talking about Autism Be aware of the neurodiversity perspective Try to distinguish the morbidities of autism from autism as an identity Don't talk about cure; but helping child reach full potential as a person with autsim Two Critical Resources for Parents Autism Speaks (leading research foundation) www.autismspeaks.org Great resources for parents.. A set of downloadable \"toolkits\" addressing common behavior problems Check this yourself if you are asked a tough behavior problem related to autism Your state Autism Society Support groups Runs parent education groups, and answers questions about local resources Medical Evaluation Never forget audiology if language delayed! Physical exam with Woods lamp as thorough as possible; specific testing and genetics referral if suggested by findings on exam or family history Fragile X and Microarray are recommended as basic workup - especially if significant cognitive delay or other anomalies Metabolic workup if Hx of regression MRI only for macro - or microcephaly, asymmetry on neurologic exam, significant intellectual disability EEG if suggestions of seizure activity More on the Microarray Parents should be informed that this is recommended for all children with autism by American College of Genetics (2009) But proceed with caution if doing yourself: Yield is low for phenotypically normal and higher (cognitively) functioning children Significant chance of incidental variations Cost is around $2000 for both Fragile X and microarray; can be issue for high deductible plans Four \"Standard\" Therapeutic Strategies Speech and Language: need to address visual communication Occupational Therapy: helpful in addressing (but not curing!) sensorimotor challenges associated with autism Structured Education (TEACCH): focuses on making home and routines \"autism friendly\" Behavioral: Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) and its variations More on ABA The most evidence -supported therapy for improving communication and behavior in autism In earlier years, was often very rigid reward/punishment (Discrete Trial Conditioning); \" aversives \" dropped long ago Has evolved into more naturalistic approaches (ie, early start Denver model, pivotal response training) - take advantage of child's natural inclinations to promote communication What if parents ask you about CAM approaches? Don't judge too quickly - think about being in their shoes! Help parents be informed consumers - look at anecdotal claims with suspicion Identify possible risks and costs - avoid potentially dangerous interventions (chelation) And if they do wish to try a safe intervention, have a concrete plan to assess target symptoms CAM in Autism: Evidence Grades Levy SE, Hyman SL Child Adol Psych Clin N Amer 2015; 24: 117 -143 Grade A: No positive trials Strong NEGATIVE evidence for secretin Grade B: Melatonin, Vitamin C, Music Therapy, GFCF Diet Grade C+: Oxytocin Grade C: Vitamin D, Omega -3 FA Grade D: Chelation Agents (DMSA; one death reported); Vitamin B6/Magnesium The GFCF Diet Used by 15 -16% of children per Interactive Autism Network Based on \"leaky gut\" hypothesis: allowing entry of gluten - and casein -based peptides into circulation and then binding to opioid receptors in CNS Early studies reported abnormal levels of gluten and casein in urine of children with autism; but studies were not replicated Still, diet was aggressively promoted in 1990s GFCF Diet: Best studies Four published experimental studies prior to 2015 had conflicting results Compromised by reliance on nonblinded parent reports, and no effort to control concomitant therapies Hymen et al (2015) small but well designed double blind challenge trial addressed both shortcomings - and showed no benefit. N -14. Hyman SL (2015). J Autism Dev Disord 46:205 -220. GCFC Diet: What you can tell parents If it works at all, can only be on a small subset of patients with ASD Anecdotal reports have likely failed to mention concomitant therapies Difficult to implement - especially in feeding - averse children Involve a nutritionist, and have a clear assessment plan And What About Vaccines? Talking Points You can tell parents that while the rising prevalence of autism is not fully understood, expanded recognition explains most of it, and numerous studies have examined, and exonerated, any role for vaccines Can talk about problems of anecdotal reports: selective memory and omitted details And the fate of Dr Wakefield... And maybe try sharing a little history If they still worry that vaccines explain the rise of autism, ask: Why was there no autism epidemic in 1970s, when US introduced MMR? Why did autism rates fail to decrease after thimerosal withdrawn from vaccines after 2003? In the end, much comes down to building a relationship of trust Tomorrow: Autism Co - Morbidities Sleep Diet Behavior "}
