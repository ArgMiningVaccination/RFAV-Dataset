How we chose the best essential oil diffusers We surveyed our nationwide tester panel about what they look for in a diffuser. From 10 diffuser models, more than 6,600 people responded and contributed feedback that helped us assess important factors such as ease of use, stream intensity, water capacity, appearance (it's important!), extra features, automatic shut-off and overall quality. Our in-Lab panelists valued appearance the most and sought diffusers for their fragrance impact, with lavender being a favorite among our panel. What to consider when shopping for the best essential air diffusers Types: Essential oil diffusers generally come in a few different variations. Here are the difference, per [Rachel Rothman](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/1470/rachel-rothman/), the chief technologist and executive technical director at the GH Institute: - Ultrasonic diffusers, the most common essential oil diffuser, use vibration to disperse water into a fine mist. This type is ideal for those who want a simple essential oil diffuser since they generally require less power and are lower maintenance to clean. - Evaporative diffusers use a filter and a fan and may function with or without water. These work better for small rooms since the oils aren't dispersed as far. - Nebulizing diffusers blast a high pressure air stream into a small tube, which draws the oils and then releases as a pleasant aroma without using water. That means they're great if you want to fill a large room with scent, since they disperse essential oils faster and at a higher concentration. Automatic timer: Built-in features like an automatic shut-off timer is ideal for those who want a set it and forget it experience, since this turns off the device after a certain time setting or once the water has hit pan for safety purposes. Light settings: Those who want a more soothing effect or a night light can look for diffusers with rotating color settings. Most machines offer ambient colors that double as night lights, but if you prefer your room to get completely dark, make sure there are adjustable light settings. Run time: Note that a diffuser's average use time can vary upon its stream output and water capacity, not necessarily the size. If you prefer less water refills and more economical oil use, pay close attention to the run times we outlined for each pick. Some options like Vitruvi claim eight hours while a few Amazon options can range up to 20 hours. Some portable ones like the 80 mL option above boast six hours of run time, while pint-sized ones with 400 mL water capacity can last an entire day and night. Cleaning: The maintenance of an essential oil diffuser should be minimal. Simply clean your unit with a microfiber cloth after every few uses to prevent essential oils from building up, or just drop a teaspoon of white vinegar into the diffuser and let it run. Otherwise, it can cause the quality of your machine to degrade faster. What are the best essential oils to diffuse? Once you've found the perfect diffuser, you'll want a good set of essential oils to match. Lavender and peppermint aside, some lesser-known oils have been studied to see if they combat pain, insomnia and more. Beauty, Health & Sustainability Lab Executive Director [Birnur Aral](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/12432/birnur-aral-ph-d/) recommends geranium oil, bergamot oil and anxiety-reducing and muscle-relaxing benefits. For a bit mental reprieve, bergamot oil [reduces stress](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/380989?), while ylang ylang boosted self-esteem in [test groups](https://www.scielo.br/j/reeusp/a/pxVJcRwHMzPQmNkcKdYJGLn/?lang=en). With that said, essential oils are best suited for aromatherapy as much more formal research is still needed on its benefits: \"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies essential oils as food supplements, not drugs,\" says Dr. Patrick, \"and there is no evidence to suggest essential oils are effective (or safe) as the primary treatment of diseases and symptoms that fall outside the mind-body connection.\" Is it safe to breathe essential oils in a diffuser? Experts at [Berkeley Wellness](http://www.berkeleywellness.com/self-care/home-remedies/article/essential-oils-what-you-should-know) suggest keeping your diffuser away from pets and kids because high doses of some essential oils can be harmful to them. You should also [clean the inside of your diffuser](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/cleaning/a20707725/how-often-should-you-clean-essential-oil-diffuser/) regularly \u2014 microfiber cloths and cotton swabs work to get the excess moisture out, and rubbing alcohol tackles excess grime once or twice a month.
