Novem ber 2020 vi A NEW BIOMATERIAL FOR VACCINATION: AN AQUEOUS ZIF -8 CRYSTAL GROWTH TO PRESERVE ANTIGENS AND ENHANCE THE IMMUNE ACTIVATION Michael Andrew Luzuriaga , PhD The University of Texas at Dallas, 2020 ABSTRACT Supervising Professor: Jeremiah J. Gassensmith Biomaterials encompass a broad range of applications for m edical treatment and can be on the macroscale, such as heart valves or hip implants, to the micro scale and nanoscale, such as stitches, dental fillings or particles for drug delivery . For the last thirty years, biomaterials with sustained release propertie s have been investigated as a method to improve the delivery of vaccines. Vaccines are considered one of the most significant inventions in the human history, as it has prevented hun dreds of millions of deaths since its invention and is the main cause for extending the human life expectancy. However, a major issue with current methods of vaccination is the ir low stability at room temperature and the requirement for multiple injections to produce an immune response strong enough to develop long -term memory. For th ese reason s, the \"cold chain\" infrastructure keeps them refrigerated from manufacturer to clinic, ensur ing the epitopes in the proteinaceous vaccines do not unfold . Any failures in this process can lead to the loss of billions of dollars and , even wi th this system , the proteinaceous material will denature over time. On top of that , the necessity of multiple in jections to provide immunity it is clear how heavily we rely on the cold chain. To solve these issues, biomaterials with sustained release prope rties has been vii employed to \"cage\" proteins within a stabilizing polymer network that prevents conformational changes and enable s storage at room temperature . Herein, methods to encapsulate proteinaceous material under aqueous conditions within zeolitic imi dazole framework -8 (ZIF -8), a well -studied metal organic framework, is investigated for it's ability to activate the immune system in mice and protect vaccines from denaturation . viii TABLE LIST OF TABLES ................................ ................................ ......................... vi CHAPTER 1 SUSTAINED RELEASE BIOMATERIALS IN VACCINATIONS: A SINGLE DOSE DEFENSE AGAINST INFECTIOUS DISEASES ................................ ............. 1 INTRODUCTION INTERACTION BETWEEN 11 BIOMATERIAL IMMUNE ACTIVATION ................................ ................................ ..13 CHAPTE R 2 ENHANCED STABILITY AND CONTROLLED DELIVERY OF MOF - ENCAPSULATED VACCINES AND THEIR IMMUNOGENIC 21 DEGRADES MEDIA, SERUM, AND SOME ................................ ................................ ................................ ........... 4 A WHOLE CELL FRAMEWORK ENCAPSULATED VACCINE AGAINST CONCLUSIONS ................................ ................................ ................................ 5 CONCLUSIONS ............. 60 ................................

J., Release Biomat erials in Vaccinations : A S ingle Dose Defense Against Infectious Diseases . 2 1.1 Introduction Every year, infectious diseases cause millions of deaths worldwide making it the third leading cause of death after cardiovascular disease ( Figure 1 .1A-B).1 Presently, our society is dealing with the COVID -19 pandemic , which at the time of this writing has claimed 1 million lives and remains on a worrying trajectory as the pandemic continues. Efforts to con trol the pandemic have focused on developing prophylac tic vaccines and every possible approach to create an effective drug is being pursued. This pandemic is unique in recent human history in its expanse and severity; however, s ome of the worst pandemics i n human history have resulted in the deaths of million s of people worldwide and vaccines are credited with significantly extending human lifespans by reducing the voracity of disease spread .2-4 Vaccination was firs t described in 1796 by Edward Jenner, who experimentally proved that immunity against the deadly disease smallpox was created by inoculating a person with cowpox \u2014a similar, but less virulent virus.5, 6 This discovery provided a pathway to produce other vaccines that have either greatly mitigated or eradicat ed several deadly diseases, incl uding measles , tetanus, diphtheria, and poliovirus.7 Still, 300 years after the first vaccination, vaccines continue to be complicated therapeutics to create and distribute. Vaccination relies of the production of a robust immunological response that is otherwise triggered by an actual invading organism and a key developmental hurdle is trying to engender that same immunological response with non -infectious agents that are both potent yet not reactogenic. Further, vaccines are some of the most thermally sensitive drugs on the planet and demand complex an d expensive infrastructure that maintains cryogenic temperatures for their deployment from manufacturer to clinic. 8-12 3 Figure 1.1: A pie chart showing in percentages the A) leading causes of deat h worldwide and B) the number of deaths by the leading causes of deaths by infectious diseases for 2017. The number of publications published from 1995 - 2020 with the key word being C) vaccine refined to journals, letters, and report s, with additional ref inement for in vivo and D) polymer vaccine or sustained release vaccine refined to journals, letters, and reports, specifically regarding in vivo work. Note: 2020 publications were checked on October 15, 2020. Vaccines protect indi viduals by developing immunological memory, so when the body encounters a foreign pathogen , an immediate and proportional adaptive response against that pathogen begins before it can reproduce and cause systemic damage . The immune response to an infectious agent follows two bro adly defined phases: an initial innate response followed by an adaptive response. The initial response occurs when the cellular vanguards of the immune system \u2014neutrophils, macrophages, patterns (PAMPs) on a foreign invader using pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on their cellular surfaces. This allows these cells to verify that what it has encountered as potentially dangerous. If it is indeed a foreign su bstance, the cell will consume the material via phagocytosis and release signaling chemicals called chemokines and cytokines that recruit additional cells and induce the 4 physical symptoms of local inflammation to indicate infection. Some of these cells wil l differentiate into a ntigen presenting cells (APCs) and will migrate to the T -cell region of the draining lymph node, where they will initiate the second phase of the immune response, the adaptive response.13, 14 The adaptive respons e and development of immune memory for rapid response to previously vaccinated antigen depends upon an important interplay between T -cells and the rest of the immune system. CD4+ cells are only able to determine if an antigen is foreign or not if they were presented with the antigen by an APC that was activated in the initial infection or vaccination. From there, the activated CD4+ cells that have become memory CD4+ cells will no longer need activation from APCs during a second encounter with the infection, thus being able to mount a faster and stronger immune response. Clearing a pathogen, however, requires the immune system to respond in a number of different ways. The adaptive immunity is most commonly divided into two major systems: t he first is the cell ular-mediated response, which is characterized primarily by T helper 1 CD4+ cells, which activate cytotoxic CD8+ T -cells, and this system can police human cells that might be harboring infectious pathogens. It is thought that vaccines t hat target tuberculo sis, cancer, and HIV will need to focus primarily on developing a strong cellular response. The other system produces a humoral response, characterized by T helper 2 CD4+ cells, which activate B -cells and plasma cells to secrete antibod ies. There are sever al different types of antibodies, each serving specific purposes, but most vaccines focus on producing neutralizing IgG - type antibodies that can bind tightly to the surface of a pathogen to either block it from entering cells and/or to flag it as a foreign invader that should be destroyed. This latter route has been the focus of the vast majority of vaccines, including those for COVID -19 and urinary tract infections; indeed, most successful vaccine development has largely focused on this latter route. Differentiating between foreign and self -proteins is one of the most critical parts of adaptive immunity, and this differentiation is often made by assessing the surface antigens that are displayed on the outside of a pathogen. Therefore, v accine development h as historically involved identifying the most immune stimulating aspect of a pathogen and presenting it to the immune system, with 5 the hope that the immune system will be able to mount the correct type of immune response. Three such for mulations are freque ntly employed \u2014live Live attenuated vaccines are \"living\" relatives of the infectious organism that produce no or only mild symptoms yet are capable of instigating a protective immunity agai nst a dangerous path ogen. At issue, however, is that live attenuated vaccine might replicate to o rapidly for elderly or immune compromised patients and have the potential to mutate back to a virulent form , leading to severe complications.15-18 The alternative to a live pathogen to use an inactivated pathogen that has been rendered non -reproductive (or dead) through either heat or chemical crosslinking. Alternatively, the exterior antigens can be removed or purified or genetically engin eered onto the surface of a nanoparticle so as to fool the immune system into producing antib odies that bind specifically to that antigen. In both cases, inactivation or subunit vaccines are considered to be safer than inactivated vaccine systems19-21 although both approaches frequently fail to induce a strong immune response on their own even after multiple injections, meaning they may not provide any protection against the actual disease and usually require an adjuvants in order to promote a robust immune response.22, 23 The use of adjuvants have been a way to steer t he type of response the immune system has. As the current method to determine how long a vaccine retains protection against a disease is whether the host still produces antibodies against the disease.24-26 A better way to answer this question is to determine what immune cells need to be activated in the adaptive immune system to guaran tee long-lasting protection. The ideal 21st century vaccine should be a safe, patient -friendly , and stable enough such that it can be stored at ambient conditions and provide long -term immunity after one administration . Biomaterials have been investigate d for the last three decades as strong candidate s to enhance vaccinations and improve the stability of proteins. Several studies have been published that investigate biomaterials as a tool to preserve proteins for long periods of time at room temperature by either attaching27, 28 functional groups that prevent water loss or by encapsulation29-31 to prevent unfolding, which would eliminate the need for the cold chain. We foun d that , in the last 25 years , there ha ve been a lot of publications for vaccinations that have or mention in vivo (Figure 1 .1C) and it is clear from Figure 1.1 D , that biomaterials with sustained release for vaccinations is a new 6 area gaining traction. This review will focus on biomaterials that provide sustained release and have been mainly investigated in vivo. 1.2 Types of Biomaterials Vaccine development has made remarkable progress since 1791, when Edward Jenner developed the first vaccine for smallpo x.32 Since then , safer vaccine designs have emerged and inclusion of different classes of adjuvants36 have significantly improve d long-term immunolo gical memory by generat ing higher antibody titers, while reducing severe side effects.37 However, many challenges remain as sociated with low stability, inefficient delivery, poor selectivity , and inability to translate into humans.38 For the past three decades , biomaterial -based technologies such as synthetic and n atural polymers, lipids, scaffolds, microneedles, and other particle -carriers have emerged rapidly to improv e vaccine efficacy, safety , and stability.39, 40 Biomaterials offer a unique design strategy of carrier/ad juvant for immune cargos loading, protection, modification , and administration to control targeted delivery, minimizing number of injection s, and reducing systemic and local toxicity.41-43 In this section , we disc uss biomaterials with excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and chemical mod ifiability that make them ideal candidates for controlled release vaccine delivery system. 1.2.1 Synthetic biodegradable polymers Synthetic polyesters including poly(lactic acid ) (PLGA), polyurethane (PU), and poly( -caprolactone) (PCL) are the most widely studied biodegradable polymers in the biomedical and vaccine field.44-50 They have shown favorable physiochemical properties including high biocompatibility, tunable h ydro/lipophilicity, high antigen loading, and sustained cargo release for in vivo application s.42, 51, 52 They also can be designed in different shapes with various surface chemistr ies to provide selective cell ta rgeting delivery ( e.g. APCs) and showing switchable and stimuli responsive behavior in cargo release.53-55 Flexibility of polyeste r 7 based vaccine platforms in method of antigen encapsulation ( e.g. single and double emulsion solvent evaporation , nanopercipitation, and spray drying) and route of administration ( e.g. dermal, intranasal and subcutaneous ) provides a selection of formulati ons that can enhance the immune response activation. Among the polyester materials , PLGA copolymer s are considered promising FDA approved sustained release vaccine delivery vehicle s for both antigen and adjuvant thanks to their excellent safety profile .56, 57 Although PLGA is one of the most studi ed biomater ials and has had several studies to understand the effects of surface charge,58, 59 injection interval,60 and administration route,61 it wasn't until 201 7 that particle size was considered in activating the immune system by the Guanghai lab.62 PLGA (molar ratio for lactide/glycolide = 75:25, Mw 13000 Da) particles were formulated using an oil in water technique to obtain particle sizes at 500 nm, 900 nm, 2.1 \u00b5m and 4.9 \u00b5m , all having a similar negative surface charge ( Figure 1.2A). Each particle was mixed with 25 \u00b5g of ovalbumin and injected intramuscularly twice at two -week intervals. While e ach size showed good cell viability, uptake, and overall good immune activation compared to the antigen alone , the 900 nm particle proved to perform the best in production of antibodies and cytokine compared to the other particle sizes owing to the enhanced uptake in macrophage . This study show s there are still many variables even for well -known materials to be tested in vaccine development , like surface charge, dosage, interval of injections, molecular weight or polymer ratio, in addition to particle size has on activating the immune system. Despite the successful immunization seen in vivo , PLGA particles along with other polyesters face sever al major limi tations including production of local acidic environment following hydrolysis and using harsh synthesis condition such as toxic organic solvent and high temperature s. These limitation can lead to protein denaturation , reduc tion in encapsulation efficiency, and harm to patients when the organic solvent is n't removed before injection, which has led researchers to look towards alternative biomaterials. 8 Figure 1.2: A) SEM images of different PLGA particle size s tested by the Guanghai lab to determine the effects it has on activating the immune system.

Major propertie s that ha ve attracted researchers to natural materials are their good water solubility, ease of preparation , and simple chemical modification. In addition, these biologically assembled particles have led to development of effective oral and intranasal vaccine administration that have advantages over parenteral injection such as patient compliance and convenience of at-home self -care vaccination.73, 74 Among the natural materials, c hitosan has been studied heavily and evaluated in humans for the potential use in vaccination against infectious diseases owing to its high safety and ease of clearan ce.75-77 Twenty years of r esearch ha s shown chitosan significantly enhanc es APCs uptake through electrostatic interaction owing to its positive ly charged n itrogens and can be combined with other biomaterials (e.g. PLGA ) to synergisti cally enhance immune activatio n.78-80 However, the mechanism by which chitosa n enhances an immune response wasn't investigated until 2016 by the Xu Lab .64 For this study, they used hepatitis B antigen and mixed it with acid - soluble chitosan for in vitro and in vivo adjuvant mechanistic evaluation. Their study showed that the intranasal delivery of chitosan mixed with antigen s involves a depot effect produced by insoluble chitosan at physiological pH found in the extracellular fluid , whereas in lower pH found in lysosome s they are able to facilitate escape of the encap sulated antigen, which is schematically shown in Figure 1.2C. This was corroborated in vitro with higher dendritic cell activation and in vivo with improved cell mediated activation. Again, this study shows the importance of understanding the biomaterial p roperties first. As it is possible that adjuvants may not even be needed for some of these sustained release biomaterials and could be sufficient alone with antigen to produce single shot vaccines. 1.2.3 Others Hydrogels and metal -organic frameworks that are biocompatible are other biomaterials that have been used for drug delivery that fall in between both synthetically made and naturally produced materials.81-85 A major advantage of these materials are their ability to self-assemble with antigens 10 under aqueous conditions as well as their availability for post -synthetic modifications.86-88 Given the infancy of these materials in immunology, correlation between immunog enicity and parameters such as size or antigen dosage are yet to be addressed . In some cases, biomaterial s have not been studied alone , mea ning only with antigen and without any adjuvants, to determine any immune enhancement. Most studi es will mix the biomaterial with adjuvant + antigen to show that the system all together can initiate a stronger immune response. For exa mple, a n excellent study by the Appel Lab investigated the encapsulation of ovalbumin and Poly(I:C), a toll -like receptor 3 agonist, using different formulated hydrogels.63 The hydrogel s were composed of PEG - PLA nanoparticles and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose derivatives at different ratios. The focus of the paper was to show an improve immunogenic response compared to free ova and adjuvant, showing the 2:10 slower delivery prolonged germinal center activat ion ( Figure 1.2B) and produced a better overall humoral response compared to the bolus and 1:5 injections. However, the investigation of the hydrogel alone with ova without adjuvant was not tested, nor was the toxicity, dosage and length between each injec tion and the effects this could have on the immune response. In 2016, the Qu lab encapsulated ovalbumin within ZIF -8, then mixed it with a solution of CpG. The ZIF -8 was grown in methanol and PVP was used to help stabilize the ovalbumin under these conditi ons ( Figure 1.2D).65 They showed that ZIF -8 would release less than 20% of antigen when incubated in pH 7.4 PBS buffer and would release ~90 % of the antigen after 2 h when the pH went down to 6, stating the antigen would only release after endocytosis. They injected mice subcutaneously and showed th eir system could enhance the immune activation compare to free ovalbumin + C pG, but did not look at ovalbumin encapsulated within ZIF without CpG. Further research by the Gassensmith lab showed a method to encapsulate a whole virus within ZIF -8 under aqueo us conditions and the antigen could be released when incubated in serum.89, 90 The subcutaneous injection corroborates the slow release in serum that ZIF slowly release particles from within to develop a strong hum oral response. This study was interesting because they showed a more stable method to encapsulate antigens and showed that the biomaterial could enhance the immune system without the need of the adjuvant. Howeve r, ZIF -8 formulations have not been studied t o determine how particle size, dosage, and surface modification affect the immune activation. The dissection of these biomaterials and newly developed polymer system that 11 offer sustained release attributes need to be further investigated, specifically on t he tuning of size, charge, dosage, and frequency of injections the biomaterial itself has on the activation of the immune system. 1.3 The Interaction between Antigen and Biomaterial Weak immunogenicity and short -term stability are some limitations associated with subunit antigens, where a common solution to overcome these is to use biomaterials as delivery /protection vehicles.91-93 Biomaterials can be a host that stabilizes antigens against denaturing conditions ( e.g. absence of refrigeration), can be tailored to achieve different types of release profiles ( e.g. sustained and pulsatile ), can augment the desired immune activation , and in some cases can provide lifetime immunity from a single dose.94 However, a major challenge associated with their usage is formu lation of antigen/biomaterial to achieve optimal therapeutic efficacy . Figure 1.3 portrays several antigen/biomaterial interaction approaches developed over the years . Below , we discuss some of the forces driving such interactions and their performance when injected in murine models. Figure 1.3: A schematic of different ways biomaterials interact with antigens 12 1.3.1 Interaction a nd Release The interaction between the antigen and biomaterial can be broadly classified into five categories; surface mixing, encapsulation, conjugation, and infiltration.95 Surfac adsorptio n for example, is fully driven by electrostati c or hydrophilic/hydrophobic interactions leading to weak attach ment of the antigen to the surface of the biomaterial. Thus, when tested in vivo , the composite readily dissociat es exhibiting a burst release kinetics profile .96 Differently, conjuga tion relies on chem ical crosslinking of the antigen to the biomaterial. Release is achieved through biomaterial decomposition either intracellularly or extracellularly. Further, this interaction is mostly used to improve immunogenicity.97 Encapsulation is achieved through mixing the antigen and precursors of the biom aterial during synthesis.98 Antigens encapsulated get gradually release d in vivo through biomaterial degradation or when taken up by cells and digested in low pH compartments . For sustained release kinetic profiles , adsorption and encapsulation interactions are currently the most investigated interactions for improving vaccines.99-102 While adsorption studies have focus ed more on the uptake of the biomaterial rather than a slow release of antigen,103 most in vivo studies for sustained release use encapsulation as it offer s both long -term stability and slow release for single injecti on vaccination s.55, 104 For the development of single injection vaccinations, slow or consistent re lease has been most studied in vivo and has shown significant stimulation of the immune system. 105, 106 A concern articulated by some researchers has been that antigen persistence can lead to immune cell exhaustion and lower antibody affinity to antigens.107-110 Instead, p ulsatile release seems to be a bet ter alternative as it mimics a single injection followed by several booster shots.111 For example, the Langer Lab investigated 16 different formulations of PLGA and took three formulations that exhibited pulsatile release profiles.112 The goal of this study was to show the pulsatile release could d evelop a humoral response identical to a single injection, followed by two booster shots. They foc used on the biomaterial and future studies will look at further tuning the material to elongate the pulse from two weeks to two months to mimic better the injections schedule of current vaccines. 13 1.3.2 Antigenicity and Long -term Stability Biomaterial s play a pi votal role in vacci ne development, as they c an improve the stability of the antigens encapsulated within. Thus, it is importan t that t he antigenicity and epitope stability be monitored over a long period of time. Stability in vitro has only been investigat ed for short periods of time ranging from 1 - 12 months and using circular dichroism, western blot, or enzyme -linked immunosorbent ass ay (ELISA) to determine the stability of model proteins, such as ovalbumin.60, 113 However, biomaterial usage in vaccine development is still an area of ongoing investigation; long-term stability should be assayed using antigens other than ovalbumin , which is known to be a quite robust protein. Additionally, translation to actual su bunit proteins should be investigated and verified in vivo as these studies are rare, only short -term, or just mentioned as a possibility .114- 118 The Tiyaboonchai lab encapsulated Pasteurella multocida within algin ate microparticles for subcutaneous injections. Key to this study was a 6 month storage test were antigenicity was investig ated in sampl es kept either at 4 or 37 \u00b0C. 119 Results revealed that mice injected with either formulation elicited an immune response similar to freshly encapsulated antigens. Further, the work done by Tiyaboonchai lab provides an ideal experimental template for single dose vaccination investigations. Future investigations should focus on long-term stability and researchers should test the antigenicity at RT for at least six months or longer for these systems to be able to replace the cold chain infra structure. 1.4 Biomaterial Immune Activation The investigation of biomaterials for the delivery of vaccines against infectious diseases offer new strategies to engineer specific immune responses . As discussed in section 3 , determining the antigenicity of antigens within a biomaterial will ensure that the immune activation will be produced for the correct epitope. To further verify this, the biomaterials discussed above needs to be studied in vivo to understand their role for long -term immunity from single or multi shots to any associated t oxicity. Since most investigations of biomaterials tend to be short -term, 74, 120 experiments need to be developed to ensure this field is being advanced. The following section focuses on biomateri als studied in vivo and provides an analysis of some examples in the literature, 14 which focus primarily on the production of antibodies, cyto kines, immune cells, and survival studies.121 Figure 1.4: A) The comparison of ovalbumin antibodies that have been encapsulated inside of a cubosome polymer with and without adjuvant has similar production compared to alum.

Reprinted from reference 124, with permission from Elsevier. 15 1.4.1 Antibodies: From 1995 to 2005 the main experiment conducted to determine the immune response of an antigen + biomaterial was based on the production of antibodies. The main biomaterial investi gated was PLGA with a plethora of antigens, such as diptheria, tetanus toxoid, and hepatitis B, used to determine it's effectiveness in animal models.125-128 The goal of th ose studies w as to show that a single dose of PLGA, slowly releases the antigen from within and can produce a humoral response similar to 3 inj ections of the antigen alone. 129 With the emphasis that higher antibody production means improved formulation of the biomaterial and this has be en the approach for most investigations. More recent studies go beyond just antibodies and develop ex periments to determine the increase in antibodies. For example in 2013, the Hook Lab showed that cubosomes, a lipid based nanocarrier, could prime T cells more efficiently because they can encapsulate a higher amount of antigen compared to liposomes.122 In this study, they use ovalbumin as their subunit antigen and delivered 15 \u00b5g of ovalbumin, 150 \u00b5g imiquimod, and 14 \u00b5g of monophosphoryl lipid A \u2014imiquimod and MP L are toll -like receptor agonists and used as adjuvants. As can be seen from Figure 1.4A, the Cubosome with adjuvant produced the highest amount of antibodies when compared to Liposome with adjuvant and alum. More Recently in 2019, the Irvine Lab fabricate d microneedles with silk fibroin protein tips and encapsulated HIV envelope trimer within as shown in Figure 1.4B.123 In addition, mixed within the tips they added TLR2 agonist pam 3CSK 4 and TLR3 agonist Poly I:C as adjuvants to recruit immune cells to the skin. They showed clearly that the mice vaccinated with MNs conta ining the trimer and adjuvant had the highest production of anti -trimer IgG titers compared to the mice receiving bolus injections (Figure 1.4C). Both studies showed that the biomaterial developed an immune response without the need of an adjuvant, but the inclusion of an adjuvant provided a higher response. However, both studies were short -term, lacked the type of antibod ies produced , and could have investigated if the slow release improved binding affinity, which would have provide d more information on how effective the biomaterial is at enhancing the humoral respon se. 16 1.4.2 Immune cell activation It is understandable to just look at antibody production, as the current method to determine if a vaccine is still active is to test whether a patient is still produ cing antibodies. However, to get a better understanding of how well a formulation works i t is necessary to investigate the activation of immune cells. For antigen presenting cells (APCs), researchers mainly focus on macrophage and dendritic cells and for t he activation of the adaptive immune system they look at T -cells and B-cells found in secondary lymphoid organs \u2014the lymph nodes and spleens. For example, the Xu lab investigated the mechanism of chitosan as an adjuvant, with hepatitis B as the model antige n.64 They showed that the insolubility of the chitosan particles enabled the formation of a sustained release depot and enhanced the uptake of antigens by bone marrow dendritic cells. It was clear that the chitosan particles containing hepatitis B improved the maturation of DCs as can be seen from the upregulation of CD 40, CD 80, and CD 86 ( Figure 1.4D). However, an interesting study would have been to test if the chitosan particle improved T cell activation. More recent stud ies to determine if a biomaterial c an activate immune system is by directly looking at the draining lymph nodes and spleen for activation markers on DCs and T -cells.130 The Fahm y lab124 showed that liposome and PLGA nanoparticles improve the T ce ll activation owing to sustained release antigens. They mention that most vaccine focus on developing neutralizing antibodies, even though a defense against viruses and intracellular bacteria would benefit more from a cel lular immune response. Thus, they s how that the PLGA and Liposome nanoparticle not only enhance antibodies, but also enhance the cytotoxic immune cells (CD8+) and these activated T cells (CD8+,CD44+) are specific to ovalbumin (tetramer) as seen in ( Figure 1.4E-F). Future studies should inve stigate the activation of memory T and B cells that activate specifically to the pathogen epitope. 17 Figure 1.5: The Cevhar lab investigates chitosan activation of the immu ne system when different administrations are used and compare the cytokine production of A) IL -2, B) IL -4, C) IL -6, D) IL-10, and E) IFN -.

Reprinted from reference 132, with permission from Elsevier. 18 1.4.3 Cytokines (Type of response) Cytokines as additional experiments to test the biomaterial ability to activate the immune system in vivo did not start to pick up until 2006. In addition to immune cell activation, the cytokines produced can indicate whether the immune response is Th1, Th2 or both and can distinguish how size, adjuvant, dosage, and other attributes can affect this response.62 Th 1 is an intra cellular or cell-mediated response and Th 2 tends to focus on extracellular pathogens and reducing inflammation. The Ainslie lab chemically modified a naturally occurring polysaccharide to have acid-cleavable acetal groups and silyl groups.133 They showed that extending the alkyl chain or mixing th e inulin and dextran polysaccharides at different ratios could shorten or extend the release of antigens from within. They mention an ongoing challenge with sub unit vaccines is incorporating adjuvants that safely stimulate and activates both a Th1 and Th2 immune response. They used a solvent evaporation technique to encapsulate ovalbumin within dextran microparticles to show that their particle could target APCs more efficiently and would obtain a more balanced cellular and humoral response. They vaccinated mice subcutaneously with 50 \u00b5g of ovalbumin and showed that their biomaterial produced antibodies similar to ova+alum. In addition, they looked at the amount o f TNF - produced by macrophage in vitro and the IFN - produced by splenocytes restimulated with SIINFEKL \u2014a peptide sequence of ovalbumin. same s upernatant collected from the splenocyte restimulation, they could have looked at the IL -4, IL -6, IL -12, and IL-10 to corroborate the high production of antibodies and show a balance d Th1/Th2 respons e. In fact, the Cevhar lab did a thorough investigation131 to show that their chitosan particles could activate a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response. The focus of this paper was to show that their aminated chitosan and aminated plus thiolated chitosan provide a balanced Th1/Th2 respon se when delivered intranasally and compared this to mice vaccinated subcutaneously ( Figure 1.5A). The results obtained from spleens harvested at day 253 show that intranasal injections of 20 \u00b5g of BSA encapsulated within the chitosan formulations have a si milar Th2 response when compare d to mice vaccinated subcutaneous based on the IL -6, IL -4, and IL -10 cytokine productions ( Figure 1.5B-D). The cell mediated response for mice vaccinated with chitosan was actually higher compared to subcutaneous injections and controls using CPG as an ad juvant based on the IFN - and IgG2a antibodies ( Figure 1.5E). This was a great study that compared injection routes and 19 compared their chitosan formulation to current adjuvants used in vaccinations. The only issue with cytoki nes is that different immune ce lls can produce these cytokines, therefore just measuring cytokines gives an idea of the type of response, but not specifically what cells are producing the cytokines. In order to truly understand the immune activation and th e type of response would be to do intracellular staining to determine the cytokine being produced by T helper cells. This staining method along with an antigen -specific marker for the TCR would without a doubt determine how balanced of an immune response t hese biomaterials are creating. 1.4.4 Survival Studies Survival studies for Biomaterials with an encapsulated antigen was first found in 2004 to provide protection against tumors.134 Most survi val studies with biomaterials tends to focus on how long their biomaterial can keep mice alive after inoculation with tumor cells.83, 101, 135, 136 The earliest experiment that looks at survival agains t infectious diseases using a sustained release polymer was conducted by the Zhu lab using PLGA as the biomaterial.137 They encapsulated subunit proteins, rROP18 (T. ) within PLGA microparticles to generate a long -lasting immune response. The mice were vaccinated subcutaneously and immune response was measured by lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine expression, and antibody production. In addition, they challenged the vaccinated mice six weeks after the last injection with live T. gondii and their survival was recorded daily until all mice were dead. The mice vaccinated with PLGA and rROP18 subunit protein survived the longest. Similarly, t he Han lab entrapped132 a subunit protein, CAMP factor, from streptococcus agalactiae within PLGA to develop single -dose vaccines that provide protection against diseases. Mice were vaccinated by an intraperitoneal injectio n and six weeks later were challenged with a lethal dose of S. agalactiae (LD 50 = 2\u00d7108 CFU). Mice were monitored for 10 days for mortality and the CAMP -PLGA vaccinated group had the highest chance of survival as shown in Figure 1.5F. It is fitting that PL GA was the first biomaterial to be investigated as a single dose vaccination treatment to test survival efficiency as it has been studied the longest. As researchers continue to investigate biomaterials for vaccination, survival experiments should be kept in mind to determine how well they can provide protection against infectious diseases. 20 1.5 Conclusion and Perspective This review summarizes how far we have come in understanding the use of sustained release biomaterials as a tool to improve vaccination. However, there are still questions that need to be answered for biomaterials to become a new method of vaccination. Res earchers need to report the protein loss during integration with these polymer systems, along with the antigenicity. The binding affinity between the polymer system and antigen needs to be investigated to understand the antibody p roduction occurring in viv o, followed by determining whether the antibodies produced have a strong affinity to the antigen. As some studies have shown that the continuous release of antigens could reduce the binding affinity of the antibodies produced agai nst it and induce immune e xhaustion.107, 109, 110 It is clear that more thorough studies have to be done with biomaterials without adjuvants to understand the effects that the type of release, size, charge, dosage, and injection intervals has on activating the immune system in vivo . In addition , understandin g the specific immune activation of T -cells and B -cells need to be further investigat ed. Specifically, by looking at TCR and BCR that are antigen specific and de termining the population of effector cells and memory cells during the study with biomaterials will give us a better understanding of how well they induce an immune response. Correlating all this with survival studies can give us a more quantitative answer on the level of response from the immune system that is needed to provide protection against i nfectious diseases. As newer biomaterials with improved properties are being engineered, investigators should keep these experiments in mind. The application of sustained release biomaterials to infectious diseases is still in its infancy and will require strong collaborative efforts between researchers in diverse fields. Ultimately, the field of sustained release biomaterials offers new tool s that could be used t o manipulate the immune system to develop improved vaccines that protect against infectious dis eases after a single injection and could provide long -term stability for antigens at ambient temperatures. 21 CHAPTER 2 ENHANCED STABILITY AND CONTROLLED DELIVERY OF MOF - ENCAPSULATED VACCINES AND THEIR IMMUNOGENIC RESPONSE IN VIVO Authors - Michael A.

Researchers have been motivated by these limitations and have begun to develop new methods that can enhance protein stability.10, 27, 143 -147 Metal organic framework (MOF) encapsulation has been shown29 to stabilize enzymes,148, 149 viruses,150, 151 and antibodies152 while providing structural and chemical protection. MOFs a re highly porous crystalline materials made of metal ion cl usters linked by organic ligand struts153, 154 that have shown promise fo r use in gas storage155 and separation,156, 157 catalysis,158, 159 sensing,160 and small molecules drug delivery.161-164 Recently, researchers have been shown that MOFs can immobilize165, 166 and stab ilize167, 168 biomacromolecules. In parti cular, coating proteins in zeolitic imidazolate framework -8 (ZIF -8) is proving to be a promising method for protection against conditions normally adverse to proteins, and there have been many promising advancements in this area.31, 167, 169 -171 In particular, biomimetic mineralized growth149, 150, 166 of ZIF-8 directly on to the surface of a protein has emerged as a means to encapsulate enzymes and insulin using only protein, zinc salts, and methylimidazole directly in water.172, 173 Because ZIF -8 can grow on protein surfaces of different sizes, charge states, and morphologies, this process is quite \"agnostic\" to the biomolecule host inside the ZIF.151, 170 This differs from other equally 23 elegant methods that use bespoke MOFs with tuned174-176 pore sizes to enc apsulate specific biomolecules or polymer encapsulated proteins coated with ZIF and formed in organi c protic solvents.65, 177 For instance, our lab biomimetically encapsulated Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) within a ZIF -8 shell (TMV@ZIF) and found the encapsulation process to be high yielding and promoted by a modest affinity for zinc ions toward the proteinaceous surface.151 This affinity leads to high local concentrations of zinc, which promotes a mineralization proce ss that r esults in either core-shell or monolithic crystals of bionanoparticles.149, 178 It is unclear, however, how \u2014or if\u2014 the nucleation and growth affects the secondary or tertiary structure at the protein surfac e. If the protein surface of a therapeutic protein is altered as a result of the nucleation pr ocess, unwanted immunological reactions may occur as human proteins wouldn't be recognized as \"self\" and antigens for encapsulated vaccines would raise antibodies against a misfolded protein rendering this strategy moot.139, 179, 180 Because an articulated aim166 of thermally stabilizing proteins is to improve the global distribution of vaccines, which depend upon the fidelity of their folded structure, we were drawn t o determine if changes in the immunogenicity of a viral nanoparticle would emerge following encapsulation and administration. We chose TMV, a 300 nm \u00d7 18 nm tubular RNA plant virus, as a model vaccine biomacromolecule owing to extensive data on its in vivo performance as a carrier for engineered and chemically conjugated181-183 epitopes in vaccine development ( Figure 2.1). This chemical modifiability, which can occur on both interior and exterior surfaces independen tly, has given TMV a u nique appeal beyond vaccine development as the structure tolerates attachment of dyes,184 sensors,185, 186 contrast agents,187 and bioactive molecules.188, 189 The multivalent nature of TMV comes from its 2130 identical coat proteins arranged helically around a 4 nm central pore where the viral RNA is 24 located. This allows many bioconjugations to the same virus particle, increasing local concentratio n of active sites and immobilizing them, which is one reason it is thought to be such a useful platform for vaccine development.181-183 Figure 2.1: Schematic for a nalyzing surface and stressing: TMV contains glutamate re sidues, shown in blue, on the interior pore modifiable with EDC chemistry. The viral RNA, shown in orange, is embedded inside the TMV pore. A) Native TMV is incubated with 2-methylimidazole and zinc acetate to form B) TMV@ZIF. C) TMV@ZIF is subjected to denaturing conditions such as heat and organic solvents. D) Stressed TMV@ZIF is exfoliated with EDTA. E) Recovered TMV surface integrity is characterized by ELISA. Since TMV is an established pre -clinical vaccine platform, it is a reasonable model to test the efficacy of thermal protection when encapsulated inside ZIF -8. While it is possible to remove the ZIF-8 shell to obtain pristine TMV, we wondered if this additional step was unnecessary. Indeed, it had occurred to us that the dissolution of ZIF -8, which happens slowly in biological media, may 25 present a method to formulate 'slow release' agents for proteins \u2014an area of active research interest.190, 191 We thus sought to determine if we co uld simply leave the TMV inside the protective ZIF-8 she ll and inject this composite subcutaneously in a mouse model as a method to slowly release TMV, producing an immune response similar to injecting native TMV subcutaneously. We can quantify changes to the surfaces of TMV as a result of ZIF -8 growth and remo val using anti-TMV antibodies measured in an enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A damaged or unfolded protein at the virus surface will not interact strongly with their complementary antibodie s and this loss of affinity will manifest as a diminishe d ELISA response. The TMV@ZIF composite was subjected to stressors, including heat and denaturing solvents, the ZIF shell was removed, and the recovered protein was examined by ELISA to confirm surfac e intactness. Tobacco plant infection and in vivo studie s further demonstrate the viability of ZIF -8 as a protective shell. Finally, we conducted longitudinal in vivo studies to ascertain the toxicity and immunogenicity of the TMV@ZIF -8 when implanted subc utaneously. Our results show that this strategy has cons iderable potential to operate concurrently as a substrate to stabilize proteins at above -ambient conditions as well as deliver them effectively intact and in a more linear dose. 2.2 Results and Discussion TMV@ZIF can be prepared in a number of different morpho logies151 ranging from bulky rhombic dodecahedra containing hundreds of viruses to discrete rod -shaped core -shell bionanoparticles with a shell thickness tu nable from 10 to 40 nm. Each of these morphologies have different colloidal and dispersion characteristics and for this study the following criteria were considered: i) the composite made had to be di spersible in solution for easy in vivo injection, and ii ) the kinetics of shell dissolution should allow for complete dissolution of all in vivo administered ZIF -8 by the 26 end of our one -month study. When we attempted to suspend rhombic dodecahedra, they settled out of solution too quickly and clogged the syri nge. This is in line with literature reports that particles larger than 1000 nm tend to settle rather quickly, making them a difficult material for injection.30, 192 We chose to continue forward with rods, as the ~350 nm particle size allow for them to be easily dispersed into solution and the shell exfoliates more rapidly than the larger rhombic dodecahedra. We thus set out to determine whether the ZIF -8 shell would increase the stability of TMV and if it c ould be delivered in vivo . The encapsulation of TMV into ZIF -8 crystals was obtained by mixing TMV (0.111 mg) with an aqueous solution of 2 -methylimidazole (400 mM, 3.0 mL), followed by an aqueous sol ution of zinc acetate (20 mM, 1.5 mL) ( Figure 2.1). After 16 h, the TMV@ZIF particles were collected by centrifugation at 4300 \u00d7 g and the shell diameter and rod -like morphology were verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ( Figure 2.2A). The morpholo gy of TMV@ZIF is clearly different from the common rhombic dodecahedral native ZIF -8 crystals. 27 Figure 2.2: Top: SEM images of TMV@ZIF A) non -stressed, B) heating at 100 \u00b0C for 20 min, and after soaking over night in C) methanol, D) 6 M guanidinium chloride, and E) ethyl acetate. Scale bars represent 1 \u00b5m. F) TEM image of exfoliated non -stressed TMV. Scale bar is 200 nm. Bottom: The ELISA response of naked and encapsulated TMV subject to no stress (a), heating (b), methanol (c), 6 M guanidinium chlor ide (d), and ethyl acetate (e). These labels correlate to the SEM images A -E above. The percentages range from buffer blank (0% TMV) to a separate internal control of non -stressed naked TMV (100% TMV). 28 TMV@ZIF was t hen stressed under various conditions to determine the stability of the encapsulated virus surface. Stability versus various solvents was tested: soaking in methanol, ethyl acetate, and 6 M guanidinium chloride \u2014a common protein denaturant193\u2014overnight. Thermal stability was tested by heating TMV@ZIF to 100 \u00b0C for 20 min. After stressing, samples retained their rod -like morphology, as seen in SEM ( Figure 2.2B-E), and the ZIF -8 shells retained their crystallinity, as seen in PXRD ( Figure A.2). The composites were exfoliated in EDTA, desalted, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer. The protein concentrations were then determined by Lowry assay, and all samples were diluted to 5.0 \u00d710-4 mg/mL and ELISA response determined. Since changes in the viral proteins surface are being investigated, the ELISA results were normalized to naked non -stressed TMV (100%), and buffer blank (0%) for comparison between the two. We were pleased to discover that the process of the shell formation and exfoliation did not significantly alter the protein surface and that the shell confers considerable protection to TMV when exposed to high temperatures. For instance, the percent difference between naked TMV and TMV@ZIF when heated to 100 \u00b0C for 20 min was 165.0% ( Figure 2.2 bottom, Table A.1). Likewise, the percent difference between protected and unprotected exposure to the strongly denaturing guanidinium chloride was 199.2% ( Figure 2.2 bottom ). We were also able to demonstrate that the ZIF was able to confer protection against other denaturing organic solvents ( Table A.1). 29 Figure 2.3: Top: N. benthamiana plants 10 days after inoculation with A) 0.1 M pH 7.4 potassium phosphate buffer as a negative control, B) TMV@ZIF, C) exfoliated TMV@ZIF, and D) native TMV as a positive control. Bottom: A bar graph showing the viral recovery of TMV from 1 g of harvested leaves measured by ELISA. Leaves were inoculated with buffer as a negative control, TMV@ZIF, exfoliated TMV@ZIF, and native TMV as a positive control. We then set out to determine whether encapsulating TMV would damage the RNA. To assess the protection that TMV@ZIF has on the RNA of TMV, Nicotiana benth amian a plants were inoculated with phosphate as a negative control, TMV@ZIF, TMV@ZIF exfoliated with EDTA, and native TMV as a positive control. The infection of N. benthamiana depends on the disassembly of the capsid to liberate the intact viral RN A and begin replication. Consequently, any damage to the RNA will reduce viral load in plants. 30 Inoculated leaves were collected after 10 days post infection. Visually, the control plants remained green and the other plants withered ( Figure 2.3A-D). ELISA w as pe rformed on 1 g of of leaves macerated in 10 mL of extraction buffer and centrifuged to remove the large plant matter. Since the relative amount of TMV present in the leaf matter was being investigated, the ELISA results were fit to a standard curve of native TMV and results reported as apparent TMV concentration in \u00b5g/mL. The TMV@ZIF, exfoliated TMV@ZIF, and native TMV plants showed a clear increase in ELISA response compared to the buffer -inoculated plants, with percent differences of 164.32% (a 10 -fold increase), 167.01% (an 11 -fold increase), and 175.29% (a 15 -fold increase), respectively (Figure 2.3 bottom ). This indicates that the TMV remains virulent and that the RNA survives the encapsulation and exfoliation process. Figure 2.4: a) Time schedule showing the days the mice were injected (black arrows) and submandibular blood withdrawals were performed (red arrows). Serum samples were diluted 200\u00d7, 1000\u00d7, and 5000\u00d7. b) ELISA response for each time point, buffer blank subtracted. c) hematoxylin & eosin Y staining of saline and TMV@ZIF injected mice. 31 We next turned our attention to in vivo studies on murine models to determine i) whether the virus would release from the protective ZIF shell in vivo , ii) how the antiTMV IgG production against subcutaneously administered TMV@ZIF compares to native TMV, and iii) the biocompatibility of TMV@ZIF composite. In order to determine relative antibody production and optimize serum dilutions, 2 groups (n = 4) o f BALB/c test mice were either non -injected or injected subcutaneously with native TMV and blood drawn after 10 days. In the test mice, there was a clear antiTMV ELISA response in mice injected with native TMV compared to non -injected mice after 10 days, and an optimal serum dilution range of 200\u00d7 to 5000\u00d7 was found ( Figure A.3). To continue our investigation, 12 BALB/c mice were divided into three groups (n = 4) and subcutaneously injected on day 0, 2, 4, and 6 with saline, native TMV, or TMV@ZIF. Multiple injections were administered to enhance the antibody production levels in mice. We hypothesized that the TMV@ZIF would protect the encapsulated TMV in the body for as long as native TMV and result in a similar antibody production level. Submandibular bloo d draws were conducted on day 0, 4, 7, and 35 ( Figure 2.4A). The ELISA response, which measures the production of mouse antibodies against TMV, shows that the TMV@ZIF elicits an antibody response comparable to naked TMV (Figure 2.4B). Antibody production t ypically depends upon successful uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs) \u2014for instance macrophages and dendritic cells \u2014in the body. This means that the shell is being removed before or during APC uptake. Exactly what is happening requires further study; h owever, there is literature precedent169 that ZIF-8 can dissolve in the presence of cell media and it is not unexpected that ZIF -8 would dissociate in the interstitial fluids of the subcutaneous region prior to cellular uptake. The antibody levels that were detected for the composites were comparable to that of naked TMV, confirming that the TMV@ZIF does not need 32 to be exfoliated before administration. Five days after the last blood withdrawal, hematoxylin and eosin Y (H&E) stained images were taken on various organs for each mouse to further evaluate TMV@ZIF biocompatibility. No visual difference could be determined between mice injected with saline and with TMV@ZIF ( Figure 2.4C). This confirms the biocompatibility of TMV@ZIF, following multiple subcutaneous injections with no apparent toxicity or beh avioral changes in the mice. While some literature has shown in vitro toxicity,169, 194 our study has concluded that these results may not translate in vivo . Our method depends upon the slow degradation of ZIF -8 in vi vo by physiological salts and macromolecules, suggesting that encapsulation and protein -ZIF composite formation may be an intriguing way to prolong a linear dose of protein -based drugs. This could be especially useful for the administration of insulin and vaccines, which typically require multiple injections over tim e to achieve a sustained effect.195 Histology of the tissue at the subcutaneous site of administration at the conclusion of the study \u2014which consis ted of four consecutive TMV@ZIF injections \u2014did not uncover any residual material, tissue damage, or scarring, which lead us to suspect that the full dose was being absorbed into the animal, as shown in Figure 2.4C. To better understand the rate at which TM V@ZIF was taken up by the mouse, we conducted time dependent in vivo imaging using TMV labeled on its interior with the (Cy5 -TMV, to be 12.59 mg/mL and the appar Cy5 molecules per TMV rod was determined to be 12. 13. This labeled TMV was encapsulated inside ZIF -8, which caus ed a quenching of the red fluorescence 33 (Figure A.6). This fluorescence of Cy5 -TMV was restored in full when the shell was removed, providing a clear indication of shell removal. For this study, 6 BALB/c mice were divided into two groups (n = 3), shaved to remove the hair on their torso and limbs, and injected subcutaneously with either un -encapsulated Cy5 -TMV or Cy5 -TMV@ZIF and imaged over two weeks. The images shown in Figure 2.5B show that, pri or to injection, the only fluorescence comes from the hairs ne ar the head. As shown in the series of images in Figure 2.5C, subcutaneous injection of Cy5-TMV decayed slowly over a period of 120 h. In contrast, the Cy5 -TMV@ZIF fluoresced weakly at first, fo llowed by an increase then gradual decay. After 288 h, the flu orescence at the injection site for the encapsulated material returned to baseline ( Figure 2.5A). 34 Figure 2.5: a) Fluorescence intensity over tim e.

The mice were shav ed and the only initial fluorescen ce comes from the hairs on the head. c) After injection and time point images of Cy5 -TMV or Cy5 -TMV@ZIF. 2.3 Conclusions The results of this study strongly indicate that ZIF -8 coatings not only provide protection against denaturing solvents and heat, but the nucleation and growth of the crystalline lattice does not alter the secondary or tertiary structure of protein and pro tein ensembles. Further, the shell does not 35 significantly damage the viral RNA. The ZIF -8 shells are exceptionally easy to synthesize on proteins, their composites are formed in a few seconds, and are ready to use within hours. It is clear from histology d ata that prolonged exposure to ZIF -8 does not alter tissue morphology at either the injection site or distal organs. Qualitatively, we saw no behavior changes in mice following administration, nor did any mice become ill or die as a result of prolonged exp osure to TMV@ZIF composites. On the other hand, in vivo data clearly suggest that the administration of equal quantities of immunogenic pr otein yielded identical antibody responses, showing that the release of the protein from the ZIF shell occurs to compl etion. This was further corroborated with time-dependent in vivo imaging studies, which showed a time -delayed release of the injection ove r the course of 14 days \u2014a property of ZIF -8 we aim to exploit in subsequent studies. Taken together, these data strong ly suggest ZIF -8 based shells may provide a method to concurrently protect and deliver proteinaceous drugs safely.

Copyright 2019 Taylor & Francis. 37 3.1 Introduction Over the preceding two decades, meta l-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proposed for a number of industrial applications in catalysis,158, 159 and separations156, 157, 196 and have more recently emerged as promising materials for biological sensing197 and drug delivery.161-163 The applications for drug deliv ery have run from proposed systematic delivery of small molecules to the slow release of proteins in vivo .10, 164 A significant number of these MOFs in drug delivery have focused on two hydrolytically stable system s based on either zeolitic imidazole framework - 8 (ZIF -8),30, 162 , 163 a coordination polymer composed of methyl -imidazole (HMIM) ligands bound to zinc that self -assembles into a zeolitic topological net, or use inorganic Zr 6O4(OH) 4 polynuclear clusters as secondary building units typically linking benzodicarboxylic acid struts.175, 198, 199 While these syst ems are both well -known for their hydrolytic stability, biological milieu can be quite complex and for in vivo or in vitro work, a number of aqueous buffered systems are used routinely. Of concern is that several of t hese buffers contain inorganic anions t hat can form kinetically trapped compl exes with transition metals and MOF stability in buffers has been relatively unexplored .200 In particular, buffers based on phosphates and bicarbonate are fairly ubiquitous and these salts comprise a significant portion of cell media like Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DME) as well as derivations of that media (DMEM, EMEM, etc). Further, se rum contains a substantial amount of albumin, which is a 66.5 kDa protein covered in solvent exposed thiols from externally facing cysteine residues.201 These residues are well known binders to metals and are a component of metal transport in blood .202-204 Our interest in MOFs as potential drug delivery systems has focused on slow -release of large proteins for vaccine or therapeutic delivery by injecting the drug either subdermally or 38 intramuscularly.89 Our approach has been to grow ZIF -8 non -specifically onto the s urface of the proteins,150, 151 which not only thermally stabilizes the inlayed protein but also creates a \"slow release\" mechanism for the protein to escape after implantation while protecting the protein from biological degradation by elevated temperatures or proteolytic enzymes.89 In this context, the slow dissolution of the ZIF is a critical component of drug release in that, over time, as the ZIF dissolves, it releases proteins that were \"biomimetically\" integrated into the framework. Because our MOF work frequently takes us both in vivo and in vitro, aqueous buffered solutions and cell media are frequently employed; thus , we sought to determine the stability of ZIF -8 in the most common laboratory buffer systems as well as cell media , serum , and \"whole cell media\" which is a mixture of cell media and serum . Our investigation revealed that neither phosphate nor carbonate -based buffers are innocent and induce almost immediate morphological changes as well as new and altered reflections in the PXRD pattern following exposure to these buffers. Beyond buffers, w e found that serum \"burrows\" holes into ZIF -8 crystals, the effects of which are imperceptible by PXRD, but cause cargo embedded in the crystalline matrix to leak out . In the context o f controlled protein delivery via subdermal or intramuscular implantatio n, neither of these issues are problematic \u2014in contrast, they help explain the protein release we have already observed .89 On the other hand, in vitro cell delivery and systemic delivery of small drugs may be complicated by these observations and the experimentalist should take ca re to interpret their results in light of these issues. 39 3.2 Result s and Discussion As described in the supporting information and Figure B.1, we prepared ~ 1 \u00b5m sized ZIF -8 crystals by optimizing the final concentration of zinc acetate and HMIM solutions. Our ZIF -8 sample purity was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy (IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and powder x -ray spectroscopy (PXRD ). The crystals were not activated with organ ic solvent, but they were held under dynamic vacuum to remove excess wash water to dry them out for easier handling. These crystals were then weighed out into individual 15 mL falcon tubes and dispersed in diffe rent common lab buffers, which were buffered above pH 7.4 . Additionally, we tested unbuffered 0.9% saline, which was measured to be mildly acidic from dissolved carbon dioxide. All samples were placed on a laboratory rotisserie to ensure proper mixing . Several buffers investigated had minimal effect on the apparent morphology of ZIF-8. Specifically, the 0.9% saline, 0.05 M 0.025 M HEPES buffered solutions , (Figure B.3) yielded little apparent changes over 24 hours by SEM while 1X PBS (phosphate bu ffered saline), 10X PBS, produced mild change s after several hours. On the other hand, within the first 10 mins, morphological changes \u2014in some cases , significant ones \u2014were apparent by SEM on ZIF -8 that had been placed in 0.1 M bicarbonate buffer, 0.1 M KP buffer, the cell media additive DMEM, bovine serum, and whole cell growth media, which is typically a combination of growth medium (DMEM in our case) with 10% serum. These morphological changes became even more obvious over time as can be seen in Figure 3.1 and continued until the end of our 24 hours experiment (Figure B.2). The changes observed when incubated with DMEM \u2014a commonly used buffered cell growth medium \u2014make sense, as these solutions contain 0.665 mM phosphate and 60.6 mM bicarbonate. 40 Figure 3.1: Time -resolved SEM micrographs of ZIF -8 incubated in A) water pH 7.8, B) 0.1 M Bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.5), C) 0.1 M KP Buffer (pH 7.4), D) DMEM (pH 7.6), and E) Serum (bovine serum , pH 7.9). At each time point an aliquot of the ZIF -8 was taken and wa shed three times with water, dried, and imaged by SEM. (Scale bar: 1 \u00b5m) 41 In addition to morphological analysis, a ll ZIF -8 samples were analyzed by PXRD and EDX. Prior to this, solutions in their respective buffers and media were centrifuged at 4300 \u00d7g for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was pipetted off, its pH was measured, and free Zn content was analyzed by ICP -MS ( Table B.1 and Table B.2). The remaining pellet was washed three times with water and dried under vacuum for analysis. Changes to the bulk crystals were obvious by PXRD for all the phosphate and bicarbonate containing buffers and media \u2014including DMEM. salts ( 60.6 mM ), is not surprising that incubation in DMEM and bicarbon ate show similar PXRD reflections \u201411.04\u00b0, 18.96\u00b0, and 23.92\u00b0 2\u2014in addition to the known ZIF -8 reflections ( Figure 3.2A). 42 Figure 3.2: A) PXRD and B) EDX of ZIF -8 after 24 h of incubation with water, 0.1 M bicarbonate buffer, 0.1 M KP buffer, DMEM, and serum. (supersc ript 1 are L shell electrons and superscript 2 are k shell electrons). The 0.1 M potassiu m phosphate buffer (KP), on the other hand, completely eradicated the ZIF-8 replacing it with a different crystalline material altogether . Energy -dispersive X -ray (ED X) spectroscopy shows the resulting constituent crystals to likely be zinc and potassium p hosphate salts with little HMIM remaining on the surface as noted by the lack of carbon or nitrogen ( Figure 3.2B and B.5). Considering the extensive changes with KP b uffer, we were surprised that t he PBS buffered solutions, which stands for \"phosphate buff ered saline\" showed markedly less changes in 43 the PXRD spectra ( Figure B.4). While the standard laboratory \"recipe\" for 1X PBS buffer uses an order of magnitude less p hosphate, the 10X PBS buffer has the same phosphate concentration as 0.1 M KP buffer , yet 10X PBS buffers affects were clearly more mild over the same period of time as shown by PXRD (Figure B.4). Tentatively, we ascribe this to the high NaCl concentratio n, which seems to suppress th e release of free zinc into solution per inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP -MS) data presenting in Table B.2. Surprisingly, despite the apparent morphological changes to crystals left in bovine serum, the PXRD for these samples remained largely unaffected, indicating that the crystallinity of the sample was not significantly altered ( Figure 3.2A). The other buffer s that had ZIF -8 were measured by PXRD and had no obvious changes in the spectrum, meaning that the buffers d id not change the crystal ( Figure B.4). It is clear from ICP -MS data in Table B.2 that serum was dissolving and solubilizing the Zn into solution, the most likely culprit being albumin. Finally , we wondered how these changes to the crystal composition and morphology would affect entrapped biomolecules with the assumption that some of the buffers that cause profound changes to morphology wou ld lead to leaking . For the following study, green fluorescent protein ( GFP)\u2014 a 27 k Da and barrel -shaped protein : 4.2 nm in length and 2.4 nm in diameter 205\u2014was biomimetically mineralized within ZIF -8 (Figure 3.3A) and the synthesized crystal was characterized by PXRD and FTIR (Figure B.6 and B.7). The crystal conditions were tuned such that the final crystal sizes were similar to the ones created for the preceding work as shown by DLS measurements ( Figure B.8).31, 206 GFP@ZIF was individually incubated in the buffers mentioned and ult rapure water and aqueous 0.5M EDTA \u2014which completely dissolves the ZIF-8\u2014were used as controls. Separate samples were pelleted at 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h by 44 centrifugation and f luorescence measurements of the supernatant were taken. Surprisingly, the only signif icant release of protein occurred in the serum, while , in all other cases, only a very small release occurred close to the lower limit of detection . The exact amount of GFP released from the crystals can be found in Table B.3 (Figure 3.3B and B.9). The obs erved marginal release of GFP from ZIF -8 incubated in KP, DMEM and 0.1 M bicarbonate with the observed changes in morphology and crystal composition, suggests a double displacement reaction between salts in solution with the ZIF -8 that proceeds with one co mponent \u2014either the ZIF -8 or the salt \u2014always remaining in the solid phase. In other words, even at very small scales, the salt exchange reaction appears to be completely heterogeneous. On the other hand, the GFP leak ing from serum is attributable to the fa ct that, unlike the salts, the Zn is solubilized by serum proteins, thus the ZIF is literally dissolving into solution. This is corroborated by ICP-MS data that show s the supernatant obtained from serum had half the zinc concentration of the supernatant fr om an EDTA solution, which fully dissolves the ZIF -8. This dissolving of ZIF -8 by blood proteins causes approximately 40% of the GPF to be released within 24 h. 45 Figure 3.3: An SEM micrograph of A) GFP@ZIF ( scale bar: 1 \u00b5m) and Time resolved fluorescence study showing B) the release of GFP from ZIF after 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h incubation with water, 0.1 M bicarbonate buffer, 0.1 M KP buffer, DMEM, serum, and EDTA as a control. 3.3 Conclusion s This study shows that ZI F-8 is not stable in certain buffers , even though they are all above pH 7, and that PXRD and electron microscopy studies are both needed together to fully demonstrate this . We have summarize d our results to indicate the buffer and cell prep formulations th at are \"compatible\", \"should be used with caution\", and \"not compatible\" with ZIF -8 in Table 3.1. The stability seems to be a competition between the coordination bonds of zinc and 2 -methyli midazole against strong inorganic and proteinaceous zinc binders, which include bicarbonate and phosphate and surprisingly serum proteins as well . That said, o nly serum seem to degrade ZIF -8 in such a way that allows significant quantities of GFP to escape. These experiments provide insight on the importance of buffer ch oice for in vitro and in vivo studies, storage, and drug delivery formulation. 46 Table 3.1: Buffer compatibility chart. compatib le, caution not compatible Further, we are beginning to understand how Z IF-8 fully dissolves at physiological pH in vivo and it is clear that blood proteins, will play an important component. We caution that these effects may change when using d ifferent sized proteins and we are not sure how translatable these results are to Z r-based MOFs ; however , it is worth pointing out that, under mimicked physio logical conditions, the Zr MOF UiO-66 seems to show analogous behavior .207 Finally, the changes in surface chemistry from the i nteractions with cell media clearly suggest that cells are likely not interacting with the surface of ZIF -8\u2014rather, they are interacting with a complicated surface of different formed salts and plasma pro teins, this surface composition and morphology clear ly depends upon incubation time and cell media choice. Consequently, we recommend experimental controls that include \u2014as appropriate \u2014cell media, buffers, and common plasma proteins to demonstrate morpholog ical and chemical stability for projects that use MO Fs for in vitro and in vivo applications. 47 CHAPTER 4 A WHOLE CELL METAL -ORGANIC FRAMEWORK ENCAPSULATED VACCINE AGAINST SEPTICEMIC UPEC INFECTIONS Authors - Michael A.

Copyright 2020 bioRxiv. 48 4.1 Introduction Development of vaccines against bacterial infection is an ongoing challenge. Globally disseminated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the difficulty of developing of antimicrobial agents lacking serious side effects has compelled researchers to look to different strategies to prevent pan demic spread of AMR organisms. AMR is so widespread that treatment of even routine bacterial infec tions, such as urinary tract infection (UTI), has become problematic.208 UTIs are the second most common adult bacterial infection worldwide, with ~80% of all community -acquired UTIs caused by uropathogenic Escheri chia coli (UPEC ).209 Indeed, half of all women will develop a UTI in their lifetime, and more than 40% of these individuals will experience a recurrent infection.210, 211 The incidence and recurrent nature of infection take on more urgency given that 10 -25% of uncomplicated UTI patient isolates are resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole212, 213 (TMP/SMX), a common antibiotic treatment regimen for UTI. When antibiotic treatment fails, bacteria persist in the bladder, increasing the cost of care and morbidity for the patient.214 Left untreated, lower UTI can ascend to the kidn eys progressing to the more severe diseases of pyelonephritis and urosepsis, which have a global mortality rate of 40%.215, 216 Given the ubiq uity of UTI and the high likelihood of recurrence, the societal cost is estimated to be over $5 billion each year in the US alone.217 A prophylactic vaccine would be an ideal first line of defense against UTIs but there are no FDA -approved vaccines for this disease .218 Indeed, no approved vaccine against infection caused by any pathogenic E. coli exists. 49 UPEC presents a unique challenge for the development of vaccines owing to the incredible genetic diversity of UPEC strains, which span the four major phylogenetic groups of E. coli (A, B1, B2, D).219 To create a subunit vaccine, which typically incorporates pathogen surface proteins, the selection of antigens inducing broad protection against all UPECs would be exceed ingly difficult. Additionally, subunit vaccines must be conjugated to a carrier to mimic the multivalence found in or on pathogens and require several booster shots to induce a robust immu ne response.22, 23 Inactivated, whole cell vaccines would bypass the need for specific antigen selection required for subunit vaccines. The primary hurdle for the development of inactivated whole cell bacterial vaccines is the weak immune response they elicit because of the ir short half -life within the body, poor uptake by antigen presenting cells, and surface antigen degradation by harsh fixation methods.220-222 In the present study, we have developed a method to gently inactivate whole cell bacteria by enc asing them in a crystalline metal -coordination polymeric matrix called zeolitic imidazolate framework -8 (ZIF -8). This process occurs within minutes i n water, uses inexpensive and biocompatible reagents, occurs at ambient temperatures, and most importantly, greatly improves survivability following systemic bacterial infection compared to standard inactivated formulations. 4.2 Result s and Discussion To deve lop a whole cell vaccine capable of inducing durable immune responses, we tested whether porous metal -coord ination polymers, more commonly known as metal organic framework s (MOFs), protect surface proteins from denaturation and prolong the release of bacte rial antigens. MOFs are low density, crystalline metal -coordination polymers formed from metal nodes that coordinate organic ligands in a highly repeating and ordered matrix ( Figure 4.1A and B ). These 50 materials are useful in catalysis, separations, sensors , and recently, as non -toxic vehicles for drug delivery.156-163, 2 07 We and others have described a specific type of MOF called ZIF -8,151, 166 composed exclusively of zinc metals interconnected by methylimidazole ligands, that crystallize \"biomimetic ally\" on a variety of biomacromolecules including soluble proteins, polysaccharides, viruses, and whole cells. 31, 65, 150, 169, 223 -225 For this study, we used CFT073, a model urosepsis strain of UPEC frequently e mployed in the development of new vaccines.226 Gram -negative E. coli has an outer membrane containing embedded polysaccharides and proteins,227-229 which su pport ZIF -8 growth ( Figure 4.1C). We resuspended CFT073 in a saline solution containing 2 -methylimidazole (HMIM) and zinc acetate and after washing to remove excess zinc and HMIM, analyzed the resulting encapsulated bacteria, called CFT@ZIF, by scanning el ectron microscopy (SEM), -ray (EDX) spectroscopy. ZIF-8 growth occurred exclusively on the surface of the bacteria ( Figure 4.1D). The PXRD of CFT@ZIF confirmed the shell was crystalline ZIF-8 (Figure 4.1E) and EDX confirmed the presence of zinc and phosphorus, indicat ing the presence of both bacteria and ZIF -8 (Figure C.1). An initial challenge was the formation of free or empty ZIF -8 crystals. To find conditions that reduced the number of empty ZIF -8 particles ( Figure 4.1C, white arrows), we tested a time course of in cubation and a range of salinity in the encapsulation solution. We observed that an encapsulation time of 20 minutes and a final concentration of 100 mM NaCl yielded crystal growth primari ly on the bacteria (Figure C .2). Using these parameters to generate CFT@ZIF, we then tested whether we could remove the shells from the encapsulated bacteria, in a process called exfoliation. We observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) that the b acteria 51 remained intact after dissolving the ZIF -8 shell in mildly acidic (pH 5) sodium acetate buffer and no obvious debris from lysed bacteria were seen ( Figure 4.1D). Figure 4.1: A) Simplified schemati c of a metal organic framework composed of metal nodes and organic ligands that can expand infinitely in all directions. B) The crystalline super structure of ZIF-8 is illustrated. C) Conceptualization of the synthetic process shows that the surface of an E. coli external membrane can initiate ZIF -8 growth on and around membrane -bound biomacromolecules following incubation with Zn2+ and 2 of ZIF -encapsulated UPEC strain CFT073 (CFT@ZIF) (left), which c an be removed gently in sodium acetate buffer (AB) at pH 5 to reveal whole bacteria, as seen in the transmission electron micrograph (right). White scale bars are 1 \u00b5m and white arrows are free ZIF crystals. E) Powder X -ray diffraction of CFT@ZIF compared to pristine/empty ZIF - 8, showing the measured data matches simulated PXRD spectra of pristine ZIF -8. F) Bacteria growth assay shows CFT@ZIF is not viable after exfoliation, similar to formalin fixation or heat treatment, and can be used as a method to inac tivate bacteria. The dashed line indicates the detection li mit of 100 CFU/mL. To assess the stability of the CFT@ZIF, we introduced a plasmid encoding small near -infrared fluorescent (smURFP) CFT073 during heating ( Figure C.3A). In addition to finding that thermal stress did not lyse bacteria or induce changes in the CFT@ZIF morphology, we observed that smURFP fluorescence was preserved compared to unencapsulated C FT073 ( Figure C.3B). We and others reported that ZIF -8 thermally protects proteins immobilized in the ZIF -8 matrix 52 from denaturation,148-150, 194 likely by limiting conformational mobility within the framework; however, to the best of our knowledge, an example of a protein within a microorgan ism being protected has not been reported. A challenge in whole -cell vaccine formulation is that the bacteria must be inactivated with minimal damage to the surface epitopes , including delicate membrane -bound proteins and complex oligosaccharides. We teste d whether ZIF encapsulation inactivates CFT073. Following formation of the ZIF shell, immobilized CFT073 was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and exfoliated with 500 mM sodium acetate buffer. Unencapsulated CFT073 was inactivated using formalin or heating as described for other whole -cell bacterial vaccines,230-232 and bacterial viability was measured for each condition by colony forming unit (CFU) assay, and compared to naked CFT073 incubated in unencapsulated CFT073 incubated in saline or in the sodium ace tate buffer but not for bacteria that were formalin - fixed, heat -inactivated, o r, importantly, exfoliated from the ZIF shell ( Figure 4.1F). These results support that the ZIF -shell growth process itself inactivates bacteria, which is in line with previous observations that overexposure to zinc causes bacterial cell death.233-235 Having established that CFT073 was encapsulated, intact, and inactivated, we turned to immunological studies. A humoral response depends on the activation of antigen -specific B cells to differentiate into antibody -produc ing plasma cells.236 We hypothesized that the ZIF shell would induce higher antibody titers by protecting immunogenic surface antigens. We -expressing CFT -Fixed, CFT@ ZIF, and free ZIF -8 and confirmed that emission was from smURFP within the CFT073 and that formalin fixing did not alter fluorescence in vivo (Figure C. 3C). Mice were (CFT -Fixed), or CFT@ZIF subcutaneously monitored over a period of 12 days until fluorescence levels returne d to baseline (Figure 4.2A). Images collected during this period show that intact CFT@ZIF remained at the injection site 4 days longer than CFT -Fixed ( Figure 4.2B). Figure encapsulation (CFT@ZIF).

C) Vaccination schedule for mice injected with either saline, CFT -Fixed, vaccinations and red arrows are blood draws .

Error bars represent the mean\u00b1SD. Statistical signicance was calculated using an ordinary mult 0.0005, ****p < 0.0001). We next measured ding to 54 the vaccination and blood sampling schedule in Figure 4.2C. Serum from days 21 and 42 post - injection was serially diluted and the amount of anti -CFT073 IgG produced was determined by ELISA against CFT073. Mice immunized with CFT@ZIF produced the hi ghest levels of anti- CFT073 IgG at day 21 and 42 compared to all o ther groups ( Figure 4.2D). Remarkably, even the thermally stressed more -CFT073 unstressed -inacti vated CFT -Heat formulation induced the lowest antibody production, in line with the observation that high temperatures lead to thermal denaturation of proteinaceous and sugar -based epitopes.10 As IL -6 promotes plasma cell production of immunoglobulins,237 we diluted serum from day 14 and measured IL -6 production by ELISA. IL -6 levels were hi ghest in CFT@ZIF, which correlated with enhanced production of antibodies in mice injected with this formulation (Figure 4.2E). The increase in CFT073 -specific antibodies from mice injected with CFT@ZIF supports the hypothesis that ZIF encapsulation prote cts immunogenic epitopes. Elevated antibody production may also be a result of the prolonged presence of CFT@ZIF in the tissue compared to unencapsulated bacteria. Throughout the experiment, mice were monitored daily and showed no signs of pain or changes in behavior, indicating the CFT@ZIF vaccine did not induce acute toxicity. At day 42, the mice were euthanized, and the spleen, liver, kidney, injection site, lung, and heart were collected, fixed in formaldehyde, and stained with H&E for pathological ana lysis. Organs displayed no signs of toxicity and H&E -stained organ sections showed no abnormal lesions, aggregation, or change in tissue compared to mice injected with saline ( Figure 4.2F). 55 Figure 4.3: A) Confocal micrograph CFT@ZIF(GFP).

B) Representative histograms show smURFP or GFP fluorescence, for the indicated bacterial preparati ons a nd controls. C) Confocal live cell images of smURFP -Fixed and CFT@ZIF(GFP) incubated with RAW 264.7 macrophages after 4 h. Scale bar = 20 \u00b5m. Antigen persistence via a \"depot effect\" is correlated with a strong adaptive immune response , as demonstrated above. However, a second mechanistic explanation for the greater antibody response may be increased uptake by professional phagocytes. We hypothesized that coating E. coli in a charge -neutral metal -organic framework would promote phagocyt osis. ZIF-8 the compartments of phagosomes, endosomes, and lysosomes, 30, 238 -240 which would free surface epitopes in a man ner similar to our exfoliation process in acidic buffer. To test this, we performed ZIF -8 shell growth on smURFP -expressing CFT073 in a solution with GFP to make 56 CFT@ZIF(GFP). The rapid shell formation around the CFT073 serendipitously captured solvated GFP within the crystalline matrix, which created a fluorescent \"core -shell\" c omposite that allowed us to monitor the bacteria separately from the ZIF shell ( Figure 4.3A). CFT073, CFT -Fixed, and with RAW 264.7 macrophages. Flow cytometry analyses show ed a four -fold increase in uptake of ZIF formulations of CFT073 over naked CFT073 and more than an order of magnitude increase over formalin -fixed CFT ( Figure 4.3B). Confocal microscopy images revealed that GFP was taken up by the cells, which strongly indicates that the ZIF-shell was intact during bacterial uptake ( Figure 4.3C). To rule out that the presence of ZIF -8 in the media promoted macrophage phagocytosis , a mixture of CFT 073 and ZIF -8 crystals (CFT+ZIF(GFP)) was incubated together with the macrophages , which did not result in greater CFT073 uptake compared to naked CFT073. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the ZIF encapsulation is correlated wit h increased uptake of CFT073. This, in addition to the depot effect, likely accounts for the strong antibody response observed in Figure 4.2D. Activation of a cell -mediated immune response is a vital aspect of vaccine development to promote long-term memo ry.124, 241 To determine whether CFT@ZIF promotes a cell -mediated immune response, we measured TNF -, an immunostimula tory cytokine mainly produced by macrophages and T h1 (Type 1 T helper) CD4+ T cells, and IFN -, a cytokine produced mainly by T h1 T cells and dendritic cells promot ing a cell -mediated response by stimulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes .242, 243 We employed the vaccination schedule depicted in Figure 4.2C, and on day 21, re -stimulated splenocytes collected from each group with CFT073. We measured TNF - (Figure 4.4A) and IFN- expression ( Figure 4.4B) levels by ELISA, observing that mice immunized with CFT@ZIF had higher levels of both cytokines compared to CFT-Fixed treated mice following re -stimulation. 57 Taken together, our data indicate a more robust cell mediated response in mice treated with CFT@ZIF compared to CFT -Fixed -vaccinated mice. Figure 4.4: Mice CFT073 that was inactivated with formalin (CFT - Fixed) or encapsulation Day splenocytes were colle cted from mice and incubated with 10 \u00b5g/mL of naked CFT073 for 48 h. After 48 h, the supernatant was tested for A) TNF - and B) IFN-. A second cohort of mice following the vaccination schedule 58 in Figure 4.2C were injected interperitoneally with a lethal dose of CFT 073 at day 21 and monitored for 48 h. C) Survival for each group over the course of 48 h. D ) When the mice became moribund or by the end of 48 h were assessed for the bacteria load s in the liver, spleen, and blood . Error bars represent the mean\u00b1SD. Statistical signicance was calculated using an ordinary one -way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison post-test Mice vaccinated with CFT@ZIF had increa sed antibody production and increased express ion of multiple key cytokines at day 21 compared to other CFT formulations. To determine whether these responses would be protective, we used a uro -sepsis model. We vaccinated as above with 21, we administered a lethal dose15 of CFT073 and mice were monitored over the course of 48 hours and euthanized when they became moribund, defined by lack of movement for over 15 minutes, shaking in place, and a decrease of body temperat ure. All CFT@ZIF -vaccinated mice survived after 48 hours compared to the other treated groups, which all succumbed to challenge ( Figure 4.4C). After euthanasia, blood, spleens, and livers were collected, homogenized, and CFUs were enumerated ( Figure 4.4D). Bacterial load in the blood, spleens, and livers of CFT@ZIF - vaccinated mice were four orders of magnitude lower than all the other groups. This lower bacterial load may be attribute d to the 5 -fold higher anti -CFT073 IgG that CFT@ZIF promotes over CFT - Fixed. Notably, the thermally stressed CFT@ZIF formulation promoted longer survival, which hints at a possible thermally protective effect of the ZIF -8 shell, an observation that is with considerab le precedence.31, 89, 206 4.3 Conclusion s In this work, we demonstrated that ZIF -8 effectively inactivated a urosepsis strain of UPEC, creating a persistent vaccine formul ation that considerably outperformed current whole cell 59 inactivation methods in nearly every regard. This meth od of inactivation avoids the use of toxic formaldehyde, and is faster, more convenient, and yields superior results. Only CFT@ZIF - vaccinated mice survived a lethal dose of CFT073, which we attribute to the five -fold increase in IgG and superior uptake by phagocytes as compared to CFT -Fixed-vaccinated mice. Furthermore, this reduction in bacterial load and survival exceeds the efficacy of published subunit vaccine strategies for CFT073.214, 244, 245 The results sho wing improved survival even after thermally stressing the vaccine formulation are in line with published data showing that ZIF protects surface epitope structure. Finally, the biomimetic growth strategy that we employed here is likely generalizable across a number of different organisms, presenting an enormou s opportunity for a generalizable approach toward whole -cell vaccine formulation . Formulation of the inactivated bacteria does not use dangerous or toxic compounds, involves the mixture of only three components, and the total reaction time is under 30 minu tes. Our ecologically friendly and low - cost approach makes it an ideal platform for rapid vaccine production from patient isolate UTIs. This creates an opportunity to produce rapidly patient -specific pr ophylactic and therapeutic vaccine formulations for th ose suffering from recurrent UTI in a truly personalized medicine approach . 60 CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 5.1 Conclusion s The development of materials for healthcare treatment is essential for curing disea ses. Chemistry offers a vast amount of synthetic approaches to tune biomaterials to serve specific needs, such as cell targeting, tracking, and stimuli response. However, to fully understand the safety of these biomaterials for patient care will involve co llaborations with immunologist, biologist , and pathologist from other fields . The areas of biomaterials and colloidal chemistry were used to develo p formulations for physiologically safe microparticle that could be used to del iver antigens encapsulated wit hin to patients and showed that serum would develop holes that would release the antigens over time. The joining of the areas of immunology and material science have introduced a simple one-pot method under aqueous conditions to preserve vaccines at ambien t conditions during shipping without refrigeration and eliminate the world's reliance on the cold chain. In addition, this novel vaccine protection platform has the potential to activate the immune system after a single inject ion owing to the sustained rel ease. 5.2 Future Directions There are still a lot of studies before ZIF -8 can be used as a biomaterial for vaccination and multiple directions can be followed from this work. The most beneficial study would be to determine the type of immune response ZIF -8 helps activate. The current experiments done above seem to lean more towards a Th2 type response but investigating the cytokines CD4+ helper T cells produce 61 after vaccination with ZIF -8 containing antigens and ZIF -8 without antigens would verify the mechanis m of immune activation. Other minor , but beneficial studies would be to determine the effects of number of injections, dosage, crystal size, and adjuvants have in developing adaptive immune memory. The studies of ZIF -8 as a biomaterial for vaccination shou ld move away from whole viruses and bacteria to safer subunit/inactivated vaccines to determine if it can initiate an immune response for the proteins inlayed w ithin. This would be novel because a major issue with subunit vaccines is their inability to pro duce a long -lasting, protective immune response and this would show that ZIF -8 cab be both an adjuvant and thermal protection carrier. Either way ZIF -8 has the potential to encapsulate multiple components durin g crystal growth, which could be used to encap sulate multiple antigens with adjuvant or multiple antigens at once. Animal models that can test this multiple antigen presenting system against an infectious d isease would further confirm ZIF-8 as a generalizable method for prophylactic vaccines. The immu ne response should be tested for the type of antibodies produced and immune cell activation in the lymph node , spleen, blood and area of vaccination. The testin g of known subunit proteins that the immune system develops against, during the actual infection , can be used to look at T cell and B cell activation specific to that antigen. Survival studies can be done and correlated to the cell mediated response and hu moral response to correlate what led to survival would be a very novel experiment to do. Finally , the formulation that provides long -term protection at ambient condition, produce long -lasting immune memory after a single injection, and prevents infections/ death should be tested in clinical trials. 62 APPENDIX A EXTENDED DATA FOR CHAPTER 2 MATERIALS Acetic acid, acetic anhydride, acetone, bovine serum albumin, 6 dibasic, um phosphate monobasic, sodium sulfite, sucrose, Triton X -100, Tween -20, and zinc acetate dihydr ate were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA), Chem -Impex Int'l (Wood Dale, IL, USA), or VWR (Radnor, PA, USA), and used without further modification.

Cy5-TMV@ZIF Cy5-TMV@ZIF was prepared using the same protocol as TMV@ZIF, except using Cy5 -TMV instead of native TMV. EDTA Exfoliation Exfoliation buffer was prepared by adding EDTA to 0.1 M in a 0.1 M potassium hydroxide solution. Solid potassium hydrox ide pel lets were added until the EDTA was fully dissolved, then the pH adjusted to 7.0 with HCl. TMV@ZIF composites were exfoliated by reducing the solvent level to a minimum or drying out, then adding 1 to 2 mL of EDTA Exfoliation buffer and left on a rot isserie at 37 \u00b0C. Wet samples became water -clear within the first few minutes. Resuspended dried samples became cloudy and required a longer time to clear up, up to overnight. Samples were then buffer exchanged with a 10K MWCO Pierce Protein Concentrator. TMV@ZI F Stressing Three batches of TMV@ZIF were combined and either left as is (non -stressed), soaked in 1 mL of methanol, ethyl acetate, or 6 M guanidinium chloride overnight, or heated to 100 \u00b0C in a water bath for 20 min. Naked TMV samples were stresse d in th e same manner, with 0.333 mg of TMV soaked in 1 mL solvent overnight, or heated to 100 \u00b0C for 20 min. Encapsulated samples were 70 collected via centrifugation at 4300 \u00d7 g for 20 min, rinsed with ultrapure water, and exfoliated in EDTA overnight.

The plate was read at 405 nm, 420 nm, and 450 nm, and the absorbance values of buffer blank wells averaged and s ubtract ed from the entire plate. Experiments were performed in 4 replicates and the values were normalized between that of naked non -stressed TMV (100%) and 71 that of the buffer blank (0%). The internal control ensures data comparability between separate ELISA expe riments. Percent difference was calculated according to the equation: |12| (1+2 2) where 1 and 2 are values expressed in percentages. The percent differences are listed below in Table A1. Table A .1: ELISA values of stress ed TMV, stressed TMV@ZIF, and their percent differences Stress plants were divided into 4 groups (n = 6 plants) and inoculated with 0.01 M pH 7.4 KP buffer as a negative control, TMV@ZIF in ul trapure water, TMV@ZIF exfoliated with EDTA and buffer exchanged into 0.01 M pH 7.4 KP buffer, and native TMV in 0.01 M pH 7.4 KP buffer as a positive control. Solutions were prepared such that 50 \u00b5L of solution delivered 5 \u00b5g of TMV, and 50 \u00b5L per leaf wa s used. To ensure no cross contamination each group was placed in different trays and watered and handled separately. After 10 d, the plants were collected into separate bags and stored at -80 \u00b0C until needed. Frozen leaves were coarsely ground and approxi mately 1 g of recovered plant matter per group was macerated using a mortar and pestle in 10 mL of sample extraction buffer pe r 1 g of leaves. The plant pulp was allowed to extract overnight at 4 \u00b0C, then centrifuged to remove large plant matter, and the s upernatant collected as samples for ELISA. Mouse Serum 72 Rabbit anti -TMV IgG in coating buffer was added 100 \u00b5L per well to a 96 -well plate and incubated at R.T. for 4 h or overnight at 4 \u00b0C.

The plate was emptied and washed 8\u00d7 with wash buffer. 1 mg/mL p-nitrophenylphosphate in substrate buffer was added 100 \u00b5L per well and the plate developed for 45 min at R.T. The plate was rea d at 405 nm, 420 nm, and 450 nm, and the absorbance values of buffer blank wells averaged and subtracted from the entire plate . Experiments were performed in 4 replicates, a best -fit line was fit to the blank -subtracted averaged standard values, sample val ues were calculated from the equation, dilutions were back -calculated and averaged, and values reported as the average \u00b1 stand ard deviation of the apparent sample concentrations in \u00b5g/mL. Test Mice 8 BALB/c mice were divided into two groups (n = 4) and eit her left uninjected or injected subcutaneously with 100 \u00b5g of native TMV in saline. Blood was drawn submandibularly after 10 d, centrifuged to remove erythrocytes, and relative antiTMV IgG levels determined by ELISA as per the above procedure. Serum was se rially diluted by factors of 2 from 20\u00d7 to 10240\u00d7 in order to determine relative ELISA responses and optimal serum dilution le vels for subsequent ELISAs. Mouse Time Study All mice studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas at Dallas (Protocol # 17 -05). 12 BALB/c mice were divided into three groups 73 (n = 4) and injected with saline, native TMV in saline, or TMV@ZIF suspended in saline. TMV solutions were prepared such that 200 \u00b5L delivered 10 \u00b5g of TMV. Doses of 200 \u00b5L of saline, TMV, or TMV@ZIF were administered subcutaneously on day 0, 2, 4, and 6 and blood was withdrawn sub mandibularly on day 0, 4, 7, and 35. The blood was centrifuged to remove erythrocytes, and the antiTMV IgG content of the resultan t serum was determined by ELISA as described above. At the end of the study, the mice were sacrificed for histological analysi s on the spleen, liver, kidney, lung, heart, and the skin at the administration site. The mice were sacrificed by carbon dioxide a sphyxiation, the organs harvested, and fixed in 4% formaldehyde overnight. The fixed organs were moved to a 70% ethanol soluti on and processed with an ASP300 S tissue processor (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) for dehydration into paraffin. The organs were then embedded into paraffin wax using a HistoCore Arcadia C and H paraffin embedding station (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Each organ was sliced into 4 \u00b5m sheets using a RM2235 manual microtome (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) and image d with a DMi1 optical microscope (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) at 40\u00d7 magnification. Mouse Imaging Ten BALB/c mice were fed a non -fluorescent diet and shaved once the mice showed no abdominal autofluorescence. The mice were anaesthetized with isofl urane and injected with 200 \u00b5L of saline (n = 4), Cy5 -TMV (n = 3), or Cy5 -TMV@ZIF (n = 3). The TMV -containing solutions wer e prepared such that 200 \u00b5L delivered 10 \u00b5g of TMV. A series of time points were taken at 1, 5, 10, and 30 min, with additional time points at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, and every 24 h thereafter until the fluorescence decayed back to the average level of the saline injected mice. 74 SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURES Figure A.1: 1H NMR spectra of ( 4) Figure A .2: PXRD spectra of stressed T MV@ZIF samples. 75 Figure A .3: ELISA response of test mice after 10 days.

Induction was performed at OD 0.7 with 0.8% L-arabinose for a minimum of 12 hours. Cells were pelleted at 10.5K rpm for 3 0 mins using a Sorvall LYNX 4000 centrifuge, resuspended in 1\u00d7 PBS pH 8 and lysed using a Microfluidics M - 110P Microfluidizer. Cells were again centrifuges at 10.5K rpm for 1 hour to remove cell debris. The supernatant was purified using an NGC Quest 10 FP LC equipped with a 5 -mL Bio -Scale Profinity IMAC cartridge. The samples were loaded using 1\u00d7 PBS pH 8, washe d with 10mM imidazole in 1\u00d7 PBS, pH8 and eluted with 200 mM imidazole in 1\u00d7 PBS, pH 8. GFP containing fractions were dialyzed against MilliQ water f or 3 days and lyophilized using a Labconco Freezone 2.5 Lyophilizer. Dried GFP stored at 4\u00b0C. GFP@ZIF GFP@Z IF was prepared using the same protocol as ZIF -8, except GFP had a final concentration of 0.33 mg/mL. GFP@ZIF was characterized by SEM, PXRD, and IR . DLS measurements were taken to ensure that the addition of GFP would not change the size of the ZIF -8 crys tals.

Ultrapure water was obtained from an ELGA PURELAB flex 2 system with resistivity measured to at least 18.2 M -cm. BACTERIAL STUDIES Bacterial strains and growth conditions CFT073 was obtained from ATCC and grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium at 37 \u00b0C for all experiments. pLenti -smURFP was a gift from Erik Rodriguez & Roger Tsien and was transformed into CFT073 electrocompetent cells as described: 50 \u00b5L of electrocompetent CFT073 were thawed on ice, then mixed with 100 ng of pLenti -smURFP and incubated on ice for 20 minutes. The mixture was transferred to an electroporation cuvette and electroporated at 1.8 kVs. 500 \u00b5L of SOB media was immediately added and the cells recovered for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Transformants were s elected on LB agar \u00b5g/mL ampicillin. CFT073 -smURFP was grown to OD 600 of 0.9 -1 and 10 mg/mL arabinose was added to induce smURFP expression. After 4 hours, cells were harvested by centrifugatio n at 2,000 88 \u00d7g for 10 min and washed three times with 0.9% saline. Pellets were weighed to ensure exactly 40 mg/mL of CFT073 would be the stock solution for all studies described. CFT@ZIF was prepared by adding 1 mg of CFT073 from the stock solution and 500 uL of 1600 mM 2 -methylimidazole (HMIM) into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, followed by the addition of 500 \u00b5L of 20 mM zinc acetate dihydrate (ZnOAC). The tube was capped, swirled for 20 s, and left to incubate at RT for 20 min. HMIM and ZnOAC solution we re made using 100 mM NaCl solution to keep bacteria near isotonic conditions. The solution became cloudy after a few minutes and remained colloidal throughout the incubated timeframe. Longer time frames than 20 minutes led to free ZIF -8 as seen in Extended Data Fig. 2. After 20 min, the solution was centrifuged at 4500 \u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed with ultrapure water twice. The final CFT@ZIF powder was either dried to characterize the sample or placed into 0.9% saline for in vitro and in vivo studies. Growth Killing Assay In a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, either 0.9% saline or 500 mM acetic/acetate buffer pH 5 (Acetate buffer) at a volume of 975 \u00b5L was added to each tube. 25 \u00b5L of naked CFT073 or dried CFT@Z IF was added to each tube to obtain a 1 mg/mL concentration of bact eria. Acetate buffer can exfoliate the ZIF shell and was used as a control to show that naked CFT073 will continue to grow when incubated for the same amount of time it takes to exfoliate C FT@ZIF. CFT@ZIF must be incubated for 30 min to be fully exfoliated . The naked CFT073 or CFT@ZIF was suspended in 0.9% saline and left at 80 \u00b0C for 15 minutes. As previously stated, naked CFT073 was exposed to identical stress conditions, dilutions, and in cubation in 500 mM acetic/acetate Formalin -fixed CFT073 placing 1 mg in 5% formalin to a final volume of 1 mL and incubating overnight. CFT -Fixed was then centrifuged at 4,000 \u00d7g and washed with 0 .9% saline, twice. E ach of the tested conditions was serially dilut ed (10-2 to 10-9) and spotted on an LB agar plates to determine the colony -forming unit (CFU) titers formed after 12 h, individually. All experiments included n=3 per sample tested. Macrop hage Uptake by Flow CT 89 RAW Macrophage 264.7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with 10% FBEssence and 1% -streptomycin (50 \u00b5g/mL). Cells were seeded at ~105 cells/mL in a 6 well plate one day prior to testing. Th e cells were incubated with 25 \u00b5g/mL of indicated samples for 4 hou rs. The cells were washed 3\u00d7 with 1\u00d7 PBS, resuspended in 1 mL of 1\u00d7 PBS, and transferred to a 5 mL sterile polystyrene tube. ~10,000 gated events per sample were collected using a BD LSRFor tessa flow cytometer. Raw data were processed and analyzed using FlowJo\u00ae software Version 10.6.1. Histogram overlays were normalized to mode to compare samples that varied in number of recorded events. Macrophage Uptake by Live Cell Imaging RAW Macropha ge 264.7 cells were as above and seeded at ~105 cells/mL in glass b ottom dishes one day prior to testing. The cells were incubated with 25 \u00b5g/mL of indicated samples for 4 h. The cells were washed 3\u00d7 with 1\u00d7 PBS, stained with 10 \u00b5M \u00b5g/mL WGA -TRITC, washed 3\u00d7 with 1\u00d7 PBS, and kept in 2 mL of clean supplemente d media for imaging. Live cell imaging was performed with an Olympus FV3000 RS Confocal microscope. Raw images were processed using ImageJ software. Antigen stimulation of splenic T lymph ocytes Mice were injected on days 0, 7, 14 and splenocytes were isolated from immunized mice 7 days after the third immunization. Briefly, the cells were seeded at ~ 1.0 \u00d7 106 cells per well in a 24 well plate and supplemented with RPMI 1640 medium, 10 % F BEssence, 1 % penicillin - streptomycin, and 50\u00b5m -mercaptoethanol. Cells were re -stimulated with 10 ug naked CFT073 (10 g/mL) for 48 hours. The supernatant tested for cytokine production by enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Then the cells wer e stained with anti -CD3 -APC, anti -CD4 - PE/Cy7, a nti-CD8a -FITC, and a zombie violet viability kit and analyzed by flow cytometry. Additional cells were incubated with 10 ug/mL of live CFT073 and cytometry. 90 Antibody and cytokine ELISA CFT073 -specific antibody production was determined by following a previously published method.232 Briefly, lyophilized CFT073 was resuspended in 0.05 M pH 9.6 sodium carbonate/bicarbonate buffer to a concentration of 0.31 mg/mL, 150 \u00b5L was adde d to each well, and was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 9 0 min. The plate was emptied and washed 4 times with wash buffer. 200 \u00b5L of blocking buffer was added to each well and was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 45 min. The plate was emptied and washed 4 times with wash buffe r. Mouse serum was serially diluted 7 times sta rting at a 200\u00d7 dilution using 1x PBS at ph 7.4, 150 \u00b5L added to each well, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 90 min. The plate was emptied and washed 4 times with wash buffer. Alkaline phosphatase -conjugated goat ant i-mouse IgG in conjugate buffer was added 150 \u00b5 L per well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 90 min. The plate was emptied and washed 4 times with wash buffer. 1 mg/mL p -nitrophenylphosphate in substrate buffer was added at 150 \u00b5L per well and the plate developed f or 15 min at R.T. The plate was read at 405 nm and the absorbance values of the buffer blank wells averaged and subtracted from the entire plate. The blank -subtracted values of each mouse group were reported as the average \u00b1 standard deviation for each dil ution. The levels of TNF - and IFN - were deter mined by ELISA following protocols recommended by the manufacturer. ANIMAL STUDIES Ethics Statement Female BALB/c were obtained from Charles River Lab (Wilmington, Ma). All animal studies were done in accord ance with protocol #19 -06 approved by the University of Texas at Dallas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Vaccinations 20 BALB/c mice were divided into five groups (n = 4) and injected with saline, formalin CFT - saline. Heat -treated samples were placed in 80\u00b0C water for 15 minutes. CFT073 solutions were prepared such that 100 \u00b5L delivered 10 \u00b5g of CFT073. were adm inistered subcutaneously on day 0, 7, and 14, and blood was withdrawn submandibularly on day 0, 14, 21, and 42. The blood was centrifuged to remove cells, and the anti - CFT073 IgG content of the resultant serum was determined by ELISA as described above. At the end of the study, the mice were sacri ficed for histological analysis on the spleen, liver, kidney, lung, heart, and the skin at the administration site. The mice were sacrificed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, the organs collected, and fixed in 4% for maldehyde overnight. The fixed organs were moved to a 70% ethanol solution and processed with an ASP300 S tissue processor (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) for dehydration into paraffin. The organs were then embedded into paraffin wax using a HistoCor e Arcadia C and H paraffin embedding stati on (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Each organ was sliced into 4 \u00b5m sheets using a RM2235 manual microtome (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) and a DMi1 optical microscope (Leica Biosystems, Bu ffalo Grove, IL) at 40\u00d7magnification. Body Clearance 10 BALB/c mice were fed a non -fluorescent diet and shaved 12 hours before imaging to reduce autofluorescence from the hair. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and injected with 100 \u00b5L saline (n= 4), CFT(smURFP) -Fixed, or CFT(smURFP)@ZIF. The CFT073 containing solutions were prepared such that 100 \u00b5L delivered 10 \u00b5g of CFT073. A series of time points were taken after injection at 30 min, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 18 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 120 h, 168 h, 216 h, a nd 288 h. The fluorescence returned to the levels of saline at 48 hours for CFT -Fixed and 216 h for CFT@ZIF. Survival Challenge 20 BALB/c mice were divided into five groups (n = 4) and injected with saline, formalin CFT - saline. Heat treated s amples were placed in 80\u00b0C water for 15 minutes. CFT073 solutions were prepared such that 100 \u00b5L of 0.9% saline delivered 10 \u00b5g administered subcutaneously on day 0, 7, and 14. On day 21, all mice were injected interperitoneally with a lethal dose of 3.6 \u00d7 108 CFU of CFT073 per mouse and 92 monitored for 48 h. All mice were euthanized when they became moribund, which is defined by lack of movement for over 15 minutes and wh en gently touched and shaking in place. After a mouse was euthanized, the spleen and liver were collected, homogenized, and placed on agar plates at dilutions ranging from 10-2 - 10-9 to determine the CFU/g. The bl ood was also taken from each mouse and dil uted to determine the CFU/mL. Figure C.1 : The chemical analysis of CFT@ZIF was analyzed by energy dispersive X -ray.
