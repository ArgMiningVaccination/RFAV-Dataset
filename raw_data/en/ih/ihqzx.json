If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission [Here's our process](/product-selection-process). Greatist only shows you brands and products that we stand behind.Our team thoroughly researches and evaluates the recommendations we make on our site. To establish that the product manufacturers addressed safety and efficacy standards, we: - Evaluate ingredients and composition: Do they have the potential to cause harm? - Fact-check all health claims: Do they align with the current body of scientific evidence? - Assess the brand: Does it operate with integrity and adhere to industry best practices? Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the (many) active compounds found in the Cannabis sativa plant. It differs from THC mainly in that it doesn't get you \" [high](/health/does-cbd-get-you-high)\" \u2014 but that doesn't mean it has no medicinal value. Folks use CBD as a remedy for sleep problems, chronic pain and inflammation, stress, anxiety, and depression. And some have even turned to CBD to help with weight loss. While the jury is still out on how adding CBD to your daily routine influences weight loss, some evidence supports its use. So, which CBD products could be most beneficial for weight loss, what should you look for, and how do you find them? Let's answer those questions for you right here and now. - Best rated CBD: [NuLeaf Naturals anxiety: Full Capsules](#nuleafcapsules) Spectrum on the correlation between CBD and [weight loss](/health/weight-loss-stages) is limited. However, there's some information that links the two. Let's see what the science says: Boost metabolism [Animal studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5442223/) suggest that CBD may interact with certain receptors in your body \u2014 known as CB1 and CB2 \u2014 which can help rev up your [metabolism](/eat/metabolism-boosting-foods) and reduce food intake. Sounds pretty sweet, but more research (on humans) is needed to confirm these findings. Fat loss Some research suggests that CBD might affect the body's relationship to fat. In a [2016 study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11010-016-2702-5), CBD was shown to stimulate the breakdown of fat cells. This was further explored in a [2018 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6163475/), which found that CBD may help promote the \"browning\" of fat cells. During browning, white fat cells are turned into brown fat cells, which actively create heat (aka [burning calories](/fitness/do-you-burn-more-calories-in-the-heat), y'all!). This, in turn, can help with [weight loss](/health/how-to-lose-weight-fast). Appetite suppression Some folks say that CBD helps curb [cravings](/health/period-cravings) and keeps their [appetite](/eat/food-to-curb-sugar-cravings-naturally) at bay. However, there isn't much science (yet!) to back this up. Still, a [2012 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22543671/) found that rats exposed to CBD did show reduced [appetites](/health/natural-appetite-suppressant). While this is promising, more human research needs to be done to fully understand if CBD suppresses appetite. Pain management [Research from 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4508090/) examining the relationship between [chronic pain](/health/cbd-for-joint-pain) and [obesity](/health/does-losing-weight-make-you-taller) found that the two often coexist. One reason for this is that chronic pain often causes us to lead a more sedentary lifestyle, which can contribute to [weight gain](/health/stress-and-weight-gain). Other [research](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2018.01259/full) shows that CBD can be an effective way to relieve certain types of pain \u2014 like [nerve pain](/health/cbd-for-nerve-pain), inflammatory pain, and pain from osteoarthritis. Having less pain allows for a more [active lifestyle](/health/how-to-stay-active-at-home), which can help you lose weight. Stress, depression, sleep problems [Research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28849612/) shows that having a lot of stress in your life can lead to poor sleep, increased appetite, and decreased motivation for physical activity \u2014 all of which can lead to weight gain. Other [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30894189/) shows that depression can have similar effects. Sleep troubles on their own are [associated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28164452/) with weight gain, too. On the bright side, multiple studies have found that CBD can help [reduce stress](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-015-0387-1) and [improve symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7699613/) of anxiety and depression. It's also shown to [help people sleep](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7388834/) better. This is good news for your general health *and* weight loss. Insulin regulation A [2020 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7064444/) found that CBD may be effective for managing insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes as a result of its effects on lipid and glucose metabolism. These conditions are often associated with weight gain and obesity, so managing them could help prevent weight gain and/or make it easier to lose weight. But keep in mind that more large-scale studies are needed before we can say for sure whether CBD is an effective treatment for these conditions. Because the FDA doesn't have established standards for CBD testing and labeling, the quality and potency of CBD products can vary a lot. That's why we use a thorough vetting process to weed through the duds. We only include CBD products that meet the following requirements: - made by a company that provides proof of third-party testing by an [ISO 17025-compliant](https://www.iso.org/ISO-IEC-17025-testing-and-calibration-laboratories.html)lab - made with U.S.-grown hemp - contains no more than 0.3 percent THC, according to the certificate of analysis (COA) - got passing results for pesticides, heavy metals, and molds, according to the COA We also considered stuff like: - indicators of user trust and brand reputation, such as: - customer reviews - whether the company has been subject to an [FDA warning letter](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/compliance-actions-and-activities/warning-letters) - whether the company makes any unsupported health claims - company certifications and manufacturing processes - product potency - overall ingredients Pricing guide - $ = under $30 - $$ = $30-$70 - $$$ = over $70 Here's a closer look at our fave CBD product choices for peeps looking to add CBD to their weight loss routine. Best rated CBD for weight loss [NuLeaf Naturals milligrams (mg) per serving - Dosage: 1 serving (10 drops) daily - COA: available [online](https://nuleafnaturals.com/batch-reports/) This is an excellent choice for those looking for a versatile product. Its ingredients include [full-spectrum](/health/full-spectrum-cbd) hemp extract and organic virgin hemp seed oil derived from organic hemp grown in the Rocky Mountains. This CBD oil checks all the boxes and scored exceptionally well during our selection process. It's organic, ethically sourced and marketed, and third-party lab tested, and customer service ranks among the highest in the industry. How it could help with weight loss: Full-spectrum gets a lot of attention because of a theory called the \" [entourage effect](https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01238.x).\" Basically, the theory says that keeping all of the compounds found naturally in the cannabis and hemp plants (think: CBD, THC, and terpenes) together boosts CBD's therapeutic benefits. Plus, some research points to terpenes having therapeutic benefits of their own. This full-spectrum oil, in particular, contains a bunch of terpenes that are known for helping reduce anxiety and helping people fall asleep: [bisabolol](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00210-017-1405-0), [caryophyllene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC8308581/), [linalool](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7763918/), [nerolidol](https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01238.x). And like we mentioned above, reduced anxiety + [better sleep](/health/cbd-oil-for-sleep) = potentially meeting your weight loss goals. Additionally, customers recommend the product for various ailments, and they rave about the speed of delivery. Some reviewers ding this product for its unpleasant taste, but that's pretty typical for unflavored oils. Pros - potential to benefit from the entourage effect - contains anti-anxiety and sleep-inducing terpenes - fast-acting, organic - highly-concentrated - well-rated among customers Cons - unpleasant taste - pretty expensive Best CBD oil for weight loss [Bluebird Botanicals Classic Price: $ - - Potency: 5 mg per serving - Dosage: 1 serving (15 drops) up to 10 times daily - COA: available [online](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0344/3431/8381/files/Gaia_Botanicals_LLC_590_UWCLD_-_T000124611_Potency.pdf?v=1614963287) When it comes to oils, the Classic CBD Oil by Bluebird Botanicals reigns supreme.

How it could help with weight loss: Weight loss could be a byproduct of improved sleep, less pain, and reduced depression and anxiety. Although some consumers report an unpleasant taste, this product comes highly recommended for its vast array of potential benefits. Pros - potential to benefit from the entourage effect - organic - sugar-free - great customer service Cons - flavor can be unpleasant to some - no terpene profile testing Best CBD for pain relief mg - Dosage: apply a pea-sized amount as needed - COA: available Plant People's Balm is balm](/discover/cbd-balm) that relieves muscles and joints](/health/joint-supplements). On top of containing full-spectrum CBD oil, it also contains some evidence-backed ingredients that help relieve pain and increase circulation \u2014 like [arnica](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC8537440/) and [camphor](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bpb/37/12/37_b14-00442/_article). Peppermint oil adds in a cooling sensation and also [helps get rid of inflammation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21144345/). This brand also has excellent customer support. Additionally, the Plant People website provides resources and a wealth of information to guide consumers to the product that will be most beneficial for them. This level of education and transparency is valuable when shopping for suitable cannabis products. How it could help with weight loss: Plant People markets the balm for [muscle soreness](/health/it-hurts-so-good-the-lowdown-on-working-out-when-sore), mobility issues, athletic sprains and bruises, and circulation concerns.

Pros - includes evidence-backed pain-relieving ingredients - fast-acting - great customer service Cons - strong scent - oily feel Best CBD for weight loss and anxiety [NuLeaf Naturals - mg per serving - Dosage: soft gels daily - COA: available [online](https://nuleafnaturals.com/product/cbd-capsules/) NuLeaf Naturals also makes a [CBD capsule](/discover/best-cbd-capsule) formulated to support sleep and [relaxation](/grow/relaxation-required-this-meditative-throwback-playlist). The soft gel is made from a whole plant extract and its full-spectrum formulation means you could reap the bennies of the entourage effect. It contains the same anti-anxiety and sleep-inducing terpenes as its oil counterpart \u2014 bisabolol, linalool, and nerolidol. It also contains humulene, a terpene that might [help reduce inflammation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29224178/). The company upholds high quality standards and transparency through third-party lab testing. At any time, you can look up your specific item's batch and obtain the lab results. NuLeaf also uses [CO2 extraction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7272408/) to extract CBD from hemp plants, which produces a naturally potent product without any chemical solvents. How it could help with weight loss: With the potential to improve sleep, anxiety symptoms, and inflammation, these high quality soft gels are a well-rounded pick for peeps looking to use CBD for weight loss. Plus, the customer reviews for these soft gels are filled with people saying that they improve sleep quality, relieve pain, and reduce appetite.

In addition, its higher potency and natural whole-plant composition may provide safe and quick results for consumers. From growing to harvesting to bottling to consumption, the manufacturer adheres to the highest industry standards to provide you with a top product. How it could help with weight loss: There might only be two ingredients in this oil, but those two ingredients put in WERK. Full-spectrum CBD does its pain-, anxiety-, stress-relieving thang, which we already learned can help folks lose weight. But the addition of MCT oil also plays a role by potentially [controlling hunger](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031938417302111), [improving gut health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4882694/), and [increasing fat loss](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC2874190/) when used as a part of a healthy diet. Um, love that?! Pros - contains MCT oil, which might aid in weight loss - certified organic - higher potency - fast-acting - clearly labeled dropper for accurate dosing Cons - expensive - no terpenes profile testing Best CBD for weight loss and depression [Joy Organics Organic broad-spectrum - Potency: 30 mg per serving - Dosage: 1 full dropper daily - COA: available [online](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0265/5164/8355/files/Joy-for-posting-OTM900-22067B.pdf?v=1647366367) This broad-spectrum tincture from Joy Organics is a high quality option for people looking to avoid THC. Zero THC also makes this a good pick for people with [depression](/health/how-to-fight-depression). Current [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33332004/) on how THC impacts depression is a little all over the place. Some experts say that cannabis use might lead to the onset of depression, while others say the opposite. Until this is sorted out, it might be worth avoiding regular use of THC-containing CBD products. Enter: Broad-spectrum CBD. The oil is made with broad-spectrum hemp extract that works alongside organic olive oil and peppermint essential oil to give you a minty, organic CBD experience. Joy Organics products are USDA Certified Organic and provide the whole gamut of product information, including third-party lab testing and analysis.

How it could help with weight loss: Reminder: Early [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7699613/) shows that CBD has the potential to treat symptoms of depression. Reduced symptoms of depression can make living a more active lifestyle easier, helping you lose weight. Pros - THC-free option - certified organic - no artificial colors or flavors - subtle mint flavor - great customer service Cons - pricey - some users find the dropper to be leaky Best CBD gummies for weight loss [CBDistillery CBD per gummy - Dosage: 1 gummy 1-2 times daily - COA: available [online](https://www.thecbdistillery.com/product/30mg-full-spectrum-gummies-30-count/#view-lab-results?correlationId=null) If you're looking for the powerful effects of a full-spectrum tincture in an easier-to-take (and yummier) form, you may have just found it in CBDistillery's CBD Gummies. Packed with delicious strawberry flavor (which reviewers love, btw), these [gummies](/discover/cbd-gummies) pack quite the punch. Each sugary bite contains 30 mg of full-spectrum CBD. Hiii, entourage effect. Reviewers are super satisfied with these [gummies](/discover/cbd-gummies-for-anxiety), with over 80 percent of users saying that they're effective at easing anxiety, calming the mind, promoting [better sleep](/health/cant-sleep-advice-and-tips), and reducing pain. Sounds like pretty sweet perks to us! How it could help with weight loss: While their light sugar coating probably won't win you any weight loss points, the effects of these gummies might According to the COA, these gummies have two terpenes that can help reduce anxiety, promote better sleep, and reduce pain: Bisabolol and limonene. Bisabolol is that anti-anxiety and sleep-inducing terpene we've mentioned a few times now, and [limonene](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfbc.13566) is a terpene found in citrus fruits that has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The combo of CBD and these terpenes might help you get better sleep, feel less anxious, and reduce inflammatory pain \u2014 which in turn might help you lose weight. Yum. Pros - contains anti-anxiety, sleep-inducing, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory terpenes - yummy flavor - easy to take Cons - contains sugar - can cause dry mouth, fatigue, or upset stomach |Type||Price||Potency||Pros||Cons||Company Organics Organic Broad Full Spectrum CBD Gummies](https://activation.healthline.com/api/member-offers/6764/redirect?lp=465&tc=120399&subid2=%2Fgr8%2Fhealth%2Fbest-cbd-for-weight-loss&subid=cbdistillery_30mg_full_spectrum_gummies_textlink_36766&correlationId=null) Using CBD oils and creams for weight loss purposes has both benefits and drawbacks. It's important to consider these and discuss options with a healthcare professional before starting to use CBD. The potential [benefits of adding CBD](/health/cbd-benefits) to your weight loss regimen include relaxation, improved sleep, and improved management of anxiety, depression, and pain. If you experience any of these issues, CBD may help address them. And this boost in your mental and physical well-being could help your weight loss efforts. As with most [weight loss supplements](/health/weight-loss-pills), the main con of CBD is that simply adding it to your daily routine won't likely produce results. But using CBD in conjunction with a [diet and exercise](/health/can-you-lose-weight-with-diet-alone) plan may help with weight loss. Additionally, some CBD products contain trace amounts of THC, the chemical compound in cannabis that produces psychoactive effects. Though it's unlikely, you may experience some effects from the THC, depending on the type of CBD product you use. You might consider this either a benefit or a drawback, but either way, it's valuable information to know. You've already done some of the work to narrow down your search by deciding to try CBD to aid in your weight loss journey. The following considerations will help you make a safe, informed choice on the CBD product that's right for you. Certificate of Analysis (COA) Any CBD product worth its salt will have a COA from a third party that essentially verifies that the product is what it claims to be. The COA is a scientific document that vouches for the product's quality, potency, levels of CBD, and other cannabis compounds and indicates any possible contamination that may have occurred in production. If a CBD product or manufacturer does not provide a COA, walk away. Type of CBD There are three types of CBD products: isolate, broad-spectrum, and full-spectrum. - of the cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids naturally found in the cannabis/hemp plants \u2014 including THC (but never more than 0.3 percent in federally legal products). [Broad-spectrum CBD](/health/broad-spectrum-cbd)products contain all of the compounds (cannabinoids and terpenes) in the cannabis/hemp plants, but 0 THC. [CBD isolate](/live/cbd-isolate)products are exactly what they sound like \u2014 they only contain CBD and no other compounds. [Broad-spectrum and full-spectrum](/discover/full-spectrum-vs-broad-spectrum-cbd) products might have an advantage over isolate products because of the entourage effect, which is a theory that states keeping all of those compounds together makes for better benefits. So, which one's best for shedding pounds? TBH, it kind of depends on your unique needs and preferences. Ask yourself what you're looking to target with CBD use ( [boosting metabolism](/eat/metabolism-boosting-foods)? [Busting stress and anxiety](/live/anxiety-and-weight-loss)? Putting [pain in its place](/discover/cbd-cream-for-pain)?), as well as whether you want pure CBD or something a little extra-extra (*cough* the entourage effect *cough*). If you're unsure or simply want something to promote [general weight loss](/health/weight-loss-vs-fat-loss), you might want to opt for full-spectrum products over broad-spectrum or isolates. Full-spectrum CBD not only contains CBD, but it has all the bells n' whistles of the cannabis plant's other compounds, including flavonoids, terpenes, and a touch of THC. We can't guarantee weight loss, but when these compounds assemble, you're almost getting Avengers-level max strength from your CBD. Potency Potency is another consideration. All CBD products should list the potency in milligrams per serving on the bottle. As with any new product, it's best to start with a low potency \u2014 around 5 mg to really start low and slow \u2014 and increase it as you adjust to its effects. Type of product Lastly, there are a plethora of CBD products available, such as [topical creams and lotions](/health/cbd-topical), [oils](/discover/best-cbd-oils) and [tinctures](/health/full-spectrum-cbd-tincture), and [gummies](/discover/cbd-gummies). Okay, we get it: that's a helluva lot of products to choose from! So, which one's best for weight loss? Again, it depends. Your best bet is to choose according to your preferences and what works best for you. However, if you want a little guidance, we've got you. In general, CBD oils and tinctures are the most popular product types, but dosing can be tricky. If you're looking for an easy-to-use, easy-to-dose type of product, gummies, soft gels, and capsules can do the trick nicely. Not only are they already in set doses, but they're a no-brainer to take. Plus, some taste great, too (hey, fruity [gummies](/discover/cbd-gummies-for-anxiety) ). Other ingredients Some CBD products contain other ingredients such as chemical additives or flavorings, but part of the allure of CBD products is that they're all-natural. As such, products with chemical additives seem counterintuitive. However, flavored oils and [gummies](/discover/cbd-gummies-for-anxiety) are popular among those who don't like the taste of CBD by itself. But of course, you can always check the COA to make sure these flavorings are natural. Essential oils are another type of ingredient often added to CBD products. These contribute to taste and aroma or are used to dilute the concentration of CBD in an oil or cream. Although they're typically natural and safe, always read the ingredient list to make sure you don't have any allergies to them. Product directions vary, but generally, CBD products follow a similar plan for use: - Oils and tinctures. It's recommended to start with the [lowest dose](/health/how-much-cbd-should-i-take-the-first-time)and gradually increase as you get used to the product. Consider taking drops once a day at first and then adding a second dose if desired or necessary. You can take drops directly, put them in a beverage, or even mix them with lotion to use them topically. - Cream or lotion. Apply it wherever you're [experiencing pain](/health/cbd-oil-for-back-pain)or soreness. Apply the cream in the morning and before bed at first. You could also apply it after exercising as a tool for [recovery](/fitness/active-recovery). - Gummies. Take them as directed on the packaging, typically 1 gummy daily, before bed. Gummies usually contain 1 dose per serving. Dosage There are no specific recommendations on how much CBD you should take to lose weight. However, there are some general factors to consider when doling out dosage: - Peep the product label. No two products are created equally, and different manufacturers have different recommendations for how (and how much) of their CBD product to take. Carefully read the labels and follow the directions given. - Start small. Less is more when starting out with CBD. Always begin with the lowest dose possible (usually around 5 or 10 mg) and gradually increase the amount over time. - Consider your stats. Just like all products are unique, so are all people. Your unique needs and traits can affect how much CBD is right for you. Consider your body type, body weight, goals, and body chemistry when selecting potency and determining dose. - Talk with your doc. Before starting any new supplement, get advice from a healthcare pro. They can help you determine what dose will be best for you, as well as what types or forms may work well for your health and lifestyle. Want more info? You can [find more deets on dosing here](/health/how-much-cbd-should-i-take-the-first-time). At this time, there are no known safety hazards for the use of CBD alone. But some products may contain other ingredients that could cause reactions. A lot of CBD products have wholly natural and organic ingredients. Still, while these plant-based products are typically safe to use, they may sometimes lead to [side effects such as](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/): - diarrhea - drowsiness - hunger - mild psychoactive effects, depending on the THC content Some other risk factors and considerations to keep in mind about CBD: - Pregnant or nursing? Skip the CBD. The [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/what-you-should-know-about-using-cannabis-including-cbd-when-pregnant-or-breastfeeding)advises against using CBD or other cannabis-based products while pregnant or nursing, as they may cause negative effects. - CBD can interact with certain meds. You may wanna steer clear of CBD if you're taking certain meds. CBD may interact with certain drugs (both prescription and over-the-counter), and not in a good way. Talk with a healthcare pro if you're considering adding a CBD supp to your routine. - High-fat foods and CBD might not mix. Some [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7065230/)suggests that using CBD with high fat meals can increase absorption, i.e., you'll end up getting too much CBD in your system. This can increase your risk of those not-so-fun side effects. As with any supplement that's new to you, it's best to speak with a healthcare professional before consuming or applying it. Does CBD help with weight loss? Honestly, the jury's still out on this one. While CBD may not solve your weight loss woes on its own, some studies indicate that it may help you reach your weight loss goals. When combined with other healthy habits, like eating a well-balanced diet and exercising, CBD can support your weight loss journey. It can help ease pain and soreness, improve sleep quality, and reduce stress and anxiety \u2014 all of which can hinder weight loss when not properly managed. More research needs to be done in this area to know more about if and how CBD can be used as a weight-loss aid. How much CBD should I take for weight loss? CBD can affect each person differently, so dosage amounts are often as unique as you are. There isn't a standard recommendation for exactly how much CBD you should use, but some good guidelines to follow include: - Follow the instructions on your CBD product of choice. - Start with the lowest dose possible and gradually increase the amount over time. - Talk with a healthcare professional; they're the pro and can help you navigate the world of CBD. How long does it take for CBD to help with weight loss? This all depends on you, your body, your needs, and your goals. Weight loss is a journey, and there's no set time for when you'll get to your destination. While CBD may be able to help you along the way, it won't speed up the process. What CBD can do is help you feel like your best, pain-free, stress-free, and well-rested self, which can give you the energy and motivation to keep pushing forward toward your #goals. Does CBD make you high? Nope! Sure, CBD can make you feel dope AF, but [it won't get you high](/health/does-cbd-get-you-high). Even though broad-spectrum and full-spectrum CBD products contain trace amounts of THC (aka the chemical that creates the \"high\" feeling), the amounts are too low to have any sort of impact \u2014 unless you take them at super-high doses, that is. CBD products may help address various health conditions and potentially aid in weight loss. There's limited research to support CBD's direct involvement in weight loss, but it may help alleviate conditions linked to issues with weight management, such as stress and sleep problems. With this in mind, we used a rigorous ranking process to select the products on this list and suggest the safest methods for adding CBD to your weight loss efforts. Is CBD legal?The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp from the legal definition of [marijuana](https://post.healthline.com/health/hemp-vs-marijuana) in the Controlled Substances Act. This made some hemp-derived CBD products with less than 0.3% THC federally legal. However, CBD products containing more than 0.3% THC still fall under the legal definition of marijuana, making them federally illegal but legal under some state laws. Be sure to check [state laws](https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx), especially when traveling. Also, keep in mind that the FDA has not approved nonprescription CBD products, and some products may be inaccurately labeled. "}
