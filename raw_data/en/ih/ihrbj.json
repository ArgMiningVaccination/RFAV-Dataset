Review of exemption requests may take up to 10 business days, so team members are encouraged to make timely submissions of completed forms in advance of vaccination deadlines. Medical Exemptions: May be granted on permanent bases if a licensed physician, licensed physician's assistant, licensed nurse practitioner, or licensed midwife (caring for a pregnant team member) certifies in writing that such vaccination may be detrimental to the team member's health or is otherwise medically contraindicated. Must include a statement indicating which vaccine may be detrimental, including an explanation of the valid medical basis for such determination, and the length of time for which it may be detrimental. May be granted on a temporary basis up to the point when the condition supporting an exemption is expected to resolve or expire per medical providers instruction; If a team member feels a continuation of a temporary exemption is needed, they must submit a new Vaccine Exemption Request Form along with an updated note from their provider. Once the temporary exemption as expired, the team member will be expected to comply with the vaccine requirements outlined in Inova's Immunization Program Policy. Religious Exemptions: A note from your religious affiliate must describe with specificity the sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance that guides the objection to immunization. Will not be granted when opposition to the immunization is medical, scientific, political, philosophical, ethical, or otherwise secular rather than religious in nature. May require additional supporting documentation. A complete submission for vaccination exemption must include both the Vaccination Exemption Request Form and any supporting documentation described above. Exemption requests will not be reviewed if incomplete documentation is submitted. Complete submissions will be reviewed and evaluated by Team Member Health on a case-by-case basis to determine if they will be granted. Team members will be notified by Inova's Team Member Health Team whether their exemption request was approved. If an exemption is granted, the team member may be required to comply with additional safety protocols, in order to protect the health and safety of our team members and patients. To Request a Medical or Religious Exemption: Please submit the completed Vaccination Exemption Request Form along with supporting documentation outlined above and email to exemptionrequests@inova.org or you may deliver the form and supporting documentation to a Team Member Health office as noted below.
