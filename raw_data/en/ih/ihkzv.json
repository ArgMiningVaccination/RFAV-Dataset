The Enrollee's coverage will be active on the effective date regardless of whether or not the Enrollee has received all the information by the effective date. It is expected that all of the items outlined in \u00a730.4.1 of the Medicare-Medicaid Plan Enrollment and Disenrollment Guidance will be sent prior to the effective date for Passive Enrollment. 2.3.6.

Enrollee incentive programs must be offered to all current enrollees, and if used in marketing materials, must be marketed to all eligible beneficiaries, without discrimination based on race, national origin, gender, disability, chronic disease, whether a person resides or receives services in an institutional setting, or other prohibited basis. Further, when marketing Enrollee incentive programs to potential enrollees, plans must do so in conjunction with Plan benefits. 2.12.9.2.8.1. CICOs may include some incentives for Enrollees t o receive services that are 174 only available to males or females, such as prostate exams or mammograms. 2.12.9.2.9.

CICOs may at their discretion, set parameter s regarding reward amounts, and frequency limitations. 2.12.9.2.11.3. Such accounts should be designed to provide Enrollees w ith the flexibility to supplement their covered care with services and/or supports that will help them to maintain or improve their conditions. Accounts should also 175 promote Enrollee engagement and self- determination. 2.12.9.2.11.4. Accounts must allow Enrollees to purchase only non-Covered Services or supports that contribute to an Enrollee's overall health. Non-Covered Services and supports include medical or LTSS benefits that are not covered by the plan, services in excess of the covered amounts, and other supportive non-medical services. For example, CICOs could allow enrollees to apply the account funds toward services and items such as, but not limited to, dentures, nursing facility personal needs allowances, personal assistance with activities of daily living, or home modifications to make the Enrollee's personal residence safer or more accessible. 2.12.9.2.11.5. Accounts cannot be used to pay for Covered S ervices, nor may CICOs allow Enrollees to apply the account funds toward items or activities solely intended for entertainment, home improvements unrelated to or unnecessary for the Enrollee's condition, or items or services intended primarily for anyone other than Enrollee. For example, an Enrollee could not use the account funds to contribute upgrades to an institutional setting that would typically be the responsibility of the facility or for home modifications intended to accommodate a co-resident's mobility needs. Accounts should not be used for the purchase of entertainment items such as books, televisions, or gaming systems. This section is not an exhaustive list of prohibited services or items. 176 2.12.9.2.11.6.

CICOs, through their Care Coordinato rs or member services department, must provide Enrollees with information or assistance with which to find reputable service Providers when the Enrollee seeks to use the account to purchase services from Providers outside the CICO's network of clinical or LTSS Providers. For example, if the CICO permits Enrollees to use the accounts for home modifications, then the CICO must help Enrollees to find professional service Providers who meet industry qualifications. CICOs may provide Enrollees with lists of pre-screened service Providers and may prohibit Enrollees from using Providers known for Fraud, waste, Abuse, lack of professional credentials, or other quality-related concerns. 2.12.9.2.11.8. Accounts must be overseen by a financial intermedi ary that provides counseling and guidance to Enrollees to support both independence and program integrity. 2.12.9.3.

At its discretion, develop and implement processes and standards to m easure and improve the performance of the SCDHHS Enrollment Vendor staff. SCDHHS sh all monitor the performance of the SCDHHS Enrollment Vendor. 205 Section 4. Payment and Financial Provisions 4.1. General Financial Provisions 4.1.1. Capitation Payments 4.1.1.1. CMS and SCDHHS will each contribute to the total Capitation Payment paid to the CICO. CMS and SCDHHS will each make monthly payments for each Enrollee to the CICO for their portion of the capitated rate, in accordance with the rates of payment and payment provisions set forth herein and subject to all applicable federal and state laws, regulations, rules, billing instructions, and bulletins, as amended. 4.1.1.2. The CICO will receive three (3) monthly payments for each Enrollee: one amount from CMS reflecting coverage of Medicare Parts A/B services (Medicare Parts A/B Component), one amount from CMS reflecting coverage Medicare Part D services (Medicare Part D Component), and a third amount from SCDHHS reflecting coverage of Medicaid services (Medicaid Component). 4.1.1.3. The Medicare Parts A/B payment will be risk adjusted using the Medicare Advantage CMS-HCC Model and the CMS-HCC ESRD Model, except as specified in Section 4.2.4.1. The Medicare Part D payment will be risk adjusted using the Part D RxHCC Model. The Medicaid Component will utilize the rate cell methodology described in Section 4.2. 4.1.1.4. CMS and SCDHHS will provide the CICO with a rate report on an annual basis for the upcoming calendar year. 4.1.1.5. On a regular basis, CMS will provide SCDHHS with the CICO plan-level payment information in the Medicare Plan Payment Report. The use of such information by SCDHHS will be limited to financial monitoring, performing financial audits, and related activities, unless otherwise agreed to by CMS and the CICO. On a regular basis, SCDHHS will also provide to CMS CICO plan-level payment information, including the Medicaid Capitation Payments. 4.1.2. Demonstration Year Dates 4.1.2.1. Capitation Rate updates will take place on January 1st of each calendar year or more frequently, as described in this section; however, savings percentages and quality withhold percentages (see Sections 4.2.3 and 4.4.4) will be applied based on Demonstration Years, as follows: 206 4.1.2.1.1. Demonstration Year 1: February 1, 2015-December 31, 2016 4.1.2.1.2. Demonstration Year 2: January 1, 2017-December 31, 2017 4.1.2.1.3. Demonstration Year 3: January 1, 2018-December 31, 2018 4.1.2.1.4. Demonstration Year 4: January 1, 2019 - December 31, 2019 4.1.2.1.5. Demonstration Year 5: January 1, 2020 - December 31, 2020 4.1.2.1.6. Demonstration Year 6: January 1, 2021 - December 31, 2021 4.1.2.1.7. Demonstration Year 7: January 1, 2022 - December 31, 2022 4.1.2.1.8. Demonstration Year 8: January 1, 2023 - December 31, 2023 4.2. Capitated Rate Structure 4.2.1. Medicaid Component of the Capitation Payment 4.2.1.1. SCDHHS shall pay the CICO a monthly capitation amount (the Medicaid Component) based on the rate cell of the Enrollee, a sum equal to the product of the approved Capitation Rate and the number of Enrollees enrolled in that category as of the first day of that month. 4.2.1.1.1. Except as provided in Section 4.5.1, an Enrollee's rate cell will be determined by their residential status as of the first day of the month and as outlined in Exhibit 1 Medicaid Rate Cell Categories. SCDHHS will use its eligibility system to determine an Enrollee's rate cell. When there are delays in changes to an Enrollee's residential status in SCDHHS eligibility system, SCDHHS will adjust past Capitation Payments as needed. 4.2.1.2. For Demonstration Years 1 through 6, the baseline spending data for Medicaid services used for calculating the Capitation Rates was the most recent two-year historical fee-for-service data from the total population that would have been eligible for Enrollment in the 207 Demonstra tion during the historic al baseline period. Completion factors were calculated and applied to the baseline dat a, in order to include expenditures for services that were incurred but not r eported in the available data. The dat a were then adjusted for known polic y and program changes that will be in effect during the contract period. The completed and adj usted data were trended forward to the midpoint of the contrac t period and used to devel op Capitatio n Rates. All steps in this proces s were subject to CMS review. Beginning no sooner than Demonstration Year 7, SCDHHS may develop the Medicaid Component of the rates using Healthy Connections Prime data (\"experience data\" ) or other reasonab le proxy data (such as FFS program data) as appropriate, with adjustments consistent with the rate development standards outlined in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.5(c), subject to methodological agreement by CMS and SCDHHS. To the extent SCDHHS develops the Medicaid Component of the rates using this approach, SCDHHS will also project Medicaid costs, for the applicable Demonstration Year, under methodology in effect for Demonstration Years 1 through 6 (under Section 4.2.1.2). CMS and SCDHHS will compare the resulting experience-based Medicaid rates against the Medicaid costs projected under the prior rate-setting methodology to determine if there is a material difference. To the extent there is a material difference between the experience-based rates and the projected Medicaid costs, CMS and SCDHHS will jointly determine how to update the Medicaid rate setting methodology applicable to subsequent Demonstration Years to ensure cost neutrality with consideration for actuarial soundness. Any significant changes in methodology will be memorialized in future contract amendments. 4.2.1.3. The Capitation Paym ents are based on the rate cell structure and are generated by SCDHHS at the rates established in this Contract. Any and all costs incurred by the CICO in excess of the Capitation Payment will be borne in full by the CICO. 208 Exhibit 1 Medicaid Rate Cell Categories Rate Cell Description NF1: Nursing Facility- based Care Includes individuals identified with a Nursing Facility payment category beyond the three (3) months following admission as a Resident of a nursing facility. H1: Home and Community-Based Services Includes individuals who do not meet NF1 criteria, and for whom a level of care determination indicates that the individual meets the level of care requirements for nursing facility placement and/or applicable HCBS waiver . These requirements include: For the Community Choices waiver, meet the following level of care req uirements: o Skilled Level of Care - need at least one skilled service and have a least one functional deficit, as defined in the waiver, or; o Intermediate Level of Care - need at least one intermediate service and have at least one functional deficit or have at least two functional deficits, as defined by the waiver. For the HIV/AIDS Waiver, be determined at -risk for hospitalization as defined in 42 C .F.R. \u00a7440.10. For the Mechanical Ventilation Waiver, meet nursing home level of care and are dependent of a life- sustaining ventilator for six (6) or more hours per day, as defined by the waiver. H2: Home and Community-Based Services Plus Includes individuals moving from the NF1 rate cell to a qualifying HCBS waiver for the first three (3) months of transition; OR Includes HCBS Waiver individuals not residing in a nursing facility, for the first three (3) months of enrollment in the waiver. C1: Community Ti er - Community Includes individuals who do not meet NF1, H1, or H2 criteria. 4.2.2. Medicare Component of the Capitation Rate 4.2.2.1. Medicare will pay the CICO a monthly capitation amount for the Medi care Parts A/B services (the Medicare A/B Component), risk adjusted using the Medicare Advantage CMS-HCC Model and the CMS-HCC ESRD Model, except as specified in Section 4.2.4. Medicare will also pay the CICO a monthly capitation amount for Medicare Part D services, risk adjusted using the Part D RxHCC Model (the Medicare Part D Component). 4.2.2.2. Medicare A/B Component 209 4.2.2.2.1. The Medicare baseline spending for Parts A/B services are a ble nd of the Medicare Advantage projected payment rates and the Medicare FFS standardized county rates for each year, weighted by the proportion of the enrolled population enrolled in each programprior to the Demonstration. The Medicare Advantage baseline spending will include costs that would have occurred absent the Demonstration, such as quality bonus payments for applicable Medicare Advantage plans. The FFS county rates will generally reflect amounts published with the annual Medicare Advantage Final Rate Announcement, adjusted to fully incorporate more current hospital wage index and physician geographic practice cost index information; in this Demonstration, this adjustment will be fully applied to the FFS county rates in 2017, but the adjustment will otherwise use the same methodologies and timelines used to make the analogous adjustments in Medicare Advantage. CMS may also further adjust the Medicare FFS standardized county rates as necessary to calculate accurate payment rates for the Demonstration. To the extent that the published FFS county rates do not conform with current law in effect for Medicare during an applicable payment month, and to the extent that such nonconformance would have a significant fiscal impact on the Demonstration, CMS will update the baseline (and therefore the corresponding payment rate) to calculate and apply an accurate payment rate for such month. Such update may take place retroactively, as needed. 4.2.2.2.2. Separate baselines will exist for Enrollees meeting the Medicare ESRD cri teria. For Enrollees with ESRD in the dialysis or transplant status phases, the Medicare Parts A/B baseline will be the ESRD dialysis state rate. For Enrollees in the functioning graft status phase, the Medicare Parts A/B baseline will be the Medicare Advantage 3.5% bonus county rate (benchmark) for the applicable county. 4.2.2.2.3. Both baseline spending and payment rates under the Demonstra tion for Medicare Parts A/B services will be calculated as per member per month (PMPM) standardized amounts for each county participating in the Demonstration for each year. Enrollee risk scores will be applied to the standardized rates at the time of payment. 210 4.2.2.2.4. The Medicare A/B Component will be updated annually consistent with annual FFS estimates and Medicare Advantage rates released each year with the annual rate announcement. 4.2.2.3. Medicare Part D 4.2.2.3.1. The Medicare Part D baseline for the Part D Direct Subsidy will be set at the Part D national average monthly bid amount (NAMBA) for the calendar year. CMS will estimate an average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost-sharing subsidy and federal reinsurance amounts; these payments will be reconciled after the end of each payment year in the same manner as for all Part D sponsors. 4.2.2.3.2. The monthly Medicare Part D Component for an Enrollee can be calculated by multiplying the Part D NAMBA by the RxHCC risk score assigned to the individual, and then adding to this estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost-sharing subsidy and federal reinsurance amounts. 4.2.3. Aggregate Savings Percentages 4.2.3.1. Aggregate savings percentages will be applied equally, as follows, to the baseline spending amounts for the Medicare Parts A/B Component and the Medicaid Component of the capitated rate, provided that such savings percentages may be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2.3.2. 4.2.3.1.1. Demonstration Year 1: 1% 4.2.3.1.2. Demonstration Year 2: 2% 4.2.3.1.3. Demonstration Year 3: 3% 4.2.3.1.4. Demonstration Year 4: 3% 211 4.2.3.2. Rate updates will take place on January 1st of each calendar year, however savings percentages will be calculated and applied based on Demonstration Years. 4.2.3.3. Savings percentages will not be applied to the Part D component of the rate. CMS will monitor Part D costs closely on an ongoing basis. Any material change in Part D costs relative to the baseline may be factored into future year savings percentages. 4.2.4. Risk Adjustment Methodology 4.2.4.1. Medicare Parts A/B: The Medicare Parts A/B Component will be risk adjusted based on the risk profile of each Enrollee. Except as specified below, the existing Medicare Advantage CMS-HCC and CMS-HCC ESRD risk adjustment methodology will be used for the Demonstration. 4.2.4.1.1. In calendar year 2015, CMS will calculate and apply a coding intensity adjustment reflective of all Demonstration Enrollees. This will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment proportional to the anticipated proportion of Demonstration Enrollees in 2015 with Medicare Advantage experience in 2014, prior to the Demonstration. 4.2.4.1.2. In calendar year 2016, CMS will apply an appropriate coding intensity adjustment reflective of all Demonstration Enrollees; this will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment proportional to the anticipated proportion of Demonstration Enrollees in CY 2015 with prior Medicare Advantage experience and/or Demonstration experience based on the Demonstration's Enrollment phase-in as of September 30, 2015. 4.2.4.1.3. After calendar year 2016, CMS will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment to all Demonstration Enrollees. 4.2.4.1.4. The coding intensity adjustment factor will not be applied during the Demonstration to risk scores for Enrollees with an ESRD status of dialysis or transplant, consistent with Medicare Advantage policy. 212 4.2.4.2. Medicare Part D: The Medicare Part D NAMBA will be risk adjusted in accordance with existing Part D RxHCC methodology. The estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost-sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts will not be risk adjusted. 4.2.4.3. Medicaid: The Medicaid component will employ rating categories described in Section 4.2.1. 4.3. Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) 4.3.1. Medical loss ratio Guarantee 4.3.1.1. The CICO has a target MLR of eighty-five percent (85%) for Demonstration Years 1 through 6, eighty-five and a half percent (85.5%) for Demonstration Year 7, and eighty-six percent (86%) for Demonstration Year 8. 4.3.1.2. If the medical loss ratio calculated as set forth below is less than the target medical loss ratio, the CICO shall refund to SCDHHS and CMS an amount equal to the difference between the calculated MLR and the target MLR (expressed as a percentage point) multiplied by the coverage year revenue, as described in Sections 4.3.1.2.1 and 4.3.1.2.2. SCDHHS and CMS shall calculate a MLR for Enrollees under this Contract for each coverage year, beginning with Demonstration Year 1, and shall provide to the CICO the amount to be refunded, if any, to SCDHHS and CMS respectively. Any refunded amounts will be distributed proportionally back to the Medicaid and Medicare programs on a percent of premium basis, with the amount to each payor based on the proportion between the Medicare and Medicaid Components. At the option of CMS and SCDHHS, separately, any amount to be refunded may be recovered either by requiring the CICO to make a payment or by an offset to future Capitation Payment. The MLR calculation shall be determined as set forth below; however, SCDHHS and CMS may adopt NAIC reporting standards and protocols after giving written notice to the CICO. 4.3.1.2.1. For Demonstration Years 1 through 6, if the CICO has an MLR below eighty-five percent (85%) of the joint Medicare and Medicaid payment to the CICO, the CICO must remit the amount by which the eighty-five percent (85%) threshold exceeds the CICO's actual MLR (where the difference is expressed as a percentage point) multiplied by the total Capitation Payment revenue of the contract. 213 4.3.1.2.2. For Demonstration Year 7, if the CICO has an MLR beloweighty- five and a half percent (85.5%) of the joint Medicare and Medicaid payment to the CICO, the CICO must remit the amount by which the eighty-five and a half percent (85.5%) threshold exceeds the CICO's actual MLR (where that difference is expressed as a percentage point) multiplied by the total Capitation Payment revenue of the contract. 4.3.1.2.3. For Demonstration Year 8, if the CICO has an MLR below eight-six percent (86%) of the joint Medicare and Medicaid payment to the CICO, the CICO must remit the amount by which the eighty-six percent (86%) threshold exceeds the CICO's actual MLR (where that difference is expressed as a percentage point) multiplied by the total Capitation Payment revenue of the contract. 4.3.1.3. MLR will be based on the 42 C.F.R. seq 423.2400 et seq, and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 43 8.8 except that the numerator in the MLR calculation will include: 4.3.1.3.1. All Covered Services required in the Demonstration under Section 2.4 and Appendix A; 4.3.1.3.2. Any services purchase d in lieu of more costly Covered Services and con sistent with the objectives of the Demonstration; and 4.3.1.3.3. Care Coordination Expense. That portion of the personnel costs for Care Coordinators whose prim ary duty is direct Enrollee contact that is attributable to this Contract shall be included as a benefit expense. The portion of the personnel costs for CICO's medical director that is attributable to this Contract shall be included as a benefit expense. 4.3.1.4. The revenue used in the MLR calculation will consist of the Capitation Payments, as adjusted p ursuant to Section 4.2.4, due from SCDHHS and CMS for services provided during the coverage year. For Demonstration Year 1, revenue will include amounts withheld pursuant to Section 4.4.4, regardless of whether the CICO actually receives the amount in Section 4.4.4. For Demonstration Years 2-8, revenue will reflect the actual amounts received by the CICO under Section 4.4.4. 214 4.3.1.5. Data Submission. The CICO shall submit to SCDHHS and CMS, in the form and manner prescribed by SCDHHS and CMS, the necessary data to calculate and verify the MLR within eleven (11) months after the end of the run-out period. 4.3.1.6. Medical Loss Ratio Calculation. Within ninety (90) days following the data submission, SCDHHS and CMS shall calculate the MLR by dividing the benefit expense by the revenue. The MLR shall be expressed as a percentage rounded to the second decimal point. The CICO shall have sixty (60) days to review the MLR calculation. Each party shall have the right to review all data and methodologies used to calculate the MLR. 4.3.1.7. Coverage Year. The coverage year shall be the demonstration year. The MLR calculation shall be prepared using all data available from the coverage year, including IBNP and nine (9) months of run-out for benefit expense (excluding sub-capitation paid during the run-out months). 4.4. Payment Terms 4.4.1. Timing of Capitation Payments 4.4.1.1. CMS and SCDHHS will each make monthly Capitation Payments to the CICO. If an individual is enrolled with the CICO on the first day of a month, the CICO has the responsibility of providing Covered Services to that Enrollee for that month, even if the Enrollee moves to another locality. If the Enrollee moves to a locality outside of the CICO's Service Area, the Enrollee will be disenrolled from the CICO at the end of the month of change. Any and all costs incurred by the CICO in excess of the Capitation Payment will be borne in full by the CICO. The CICO shall accept SCDHHS's electronic transfer of funds to receive Capitation Payments. 4.4.1.2. The Medicare Parts A/B Component will be the product of the Enrollee's CMS-HCC risk score multiplied by the relevant standard county payment rate (or the ESRD dialysis state rate by the HCC ESRD risk score, as applicable). The Medicare Part D Component will be the product of the Enrollee's RxHCC risk score multiplied by the Part D NAMBA, with the addition of the estimated average monthly prospective payment for the low-income cost-sharing subsidy and federal reinsurance amounts. 4.4.1.3. The Medicaid component for each rate cell will be product of the number of Enrollees in each category multiplied by the payment rate for that rate cell. 215 4.4.1.4. Enrollee contributions will not be deducted during the initial three (3) months when an Enrollee enters into a nursing facility. 4.4.1.5. Enrollments 4.4.1.5.1. CMS will make monthly PMPM Capitation Payment to the CICO. The PMPM Capitation Payment for a particular month will reflect payment for the Enrollees with effective Enrollment into the CICO's Demonstration plan as of the first day of that month as outlined in Section 2.3.2. 4.4.1.5.2. Capitation rates are calculated net of an estimated average patient pay amount. The net amount is calculated by applying estimated reimbursement rate changes to the gross facility rate and subtracting trended average pay amounts. 4.4.1.5.3. SCDHHS will make monthly PMPM Capitation Payments to the CICO for the current month's Enrollment (e.g., payment for June Enrollment will occur in early June, July payment will be made in early July). The PMPM Capitation Payment for a particular month will reflect payment for the Enrollees with an active Enrollment into the CICO's Demonstration plan as of the first day of the current month. 4.4.1.6. Disenrollments 4.4.1.6.1. The final PMPM Capitation Payment made by CMS and SCDHHS to the CICO for each Enrollee will be for the month: a) in which the disenrollment was submitted, b) the Enrollee loses eligibility, or c) the Enrollee dies (see Section 2.3.6). 4.4.2. Enrollee Contribution to Care Amounts 4.4.2.1. Patient Liability is the payment amount required for individuals who are residing in nursing facilities. This amount is calculated using an individual's monthly recurring income minus a standard personal needs allowance. Patient Liability is required to be calculated for every Enrollee receiving nursing facility services, although not every Eligible Beneficiary will be required to pay each month. 4.4.2.2. SCDHHS will provide information to the CICO that identifies Enrollees who are required to pay a Patient Liability amount and the amount of 216 the obligation as part of the monthly transition report. SCDHHS Capitation Payments to CICOs for Enrollees who are required to pay a Patient Liability amount will be net of the actual monthly Patient Liability amount. 4.4.2.3. It is the responsibility of the nursing facility Provider(s) to collect the Patient Liability amount from Enrollees, and the CICO may reduce reimbursements to nursing facility Providers equal to the Patient Liability amount each month. Patient Liability amounts are to be collected at the beginning of the first full calendar month either upon completion of a traditional Medicare skilled/rehab stay or upon admission as a traditional Medicaid custodial resident. 4.4.3. Modifications to Capitation Rates 4.4.3.1. CMS and SCDHHS may propose modifications, additions, or deletions to the rate cell structure over the course of the Demonstration. Any modifications to the rate cell structure will be subject to agreement by the other governmental party. CMS and SCDHHS will confer with the CICO on any such changes in advance as appropriate and possible. CMS and SCDHHS will inform the CICO of any decisions regarding changes in rate cell structures in writing, and the CICO shall accept such changes as payment in full as described in Section 4.7. Any mid- year rate changes would be articulated in a rate report. 4.4.3.2. Rates will be updated using a similar process for each calendar year. Subject to Section 4.4.3.3 below, changes to the Medicare and Medicaid baselines (and therefore to the corresponding payment rate) outside of the annual Medicare Advantage rate announcement and annual Medicaid rate update will be made only if and when CMS and SCDHHS jointly determine the change is necessary to calculate accurate payment rates for the Demonstration. Such changes may be based on the following factors: shifts in Enrollment assumptions; major changes or discrepancies in federal law and/or state policy used in the development of baseline estimates; and changes to coding intensity. 4.4.3.3. For changes solely affecting the Medicare program baseline. CMS will update baselines by amounts identified by the independent CMS Office of the Actuary necessary to best effectuate accurate payment rates for each month. 4.4.3.4. Subject to Section 4.4.3.3 above, if other statutory changes enacted after the annual baseline determination and rate development process are jointly determined by CMS and the SCDHHS to have a material change in baseline estimates for any given payment year, baseline 217 estimates and corresponding standardized payment rates shall be updated outside of the annual rate development process. 4.4.3.5. CMS and/or SCDHHS will make changes to baseline estimates within thirty (30) days of identification of the need for such changes, and changes will be applied, if necessary on a retrospective basis, to effectuate accurate payment rates for each month. 4.4.3.6. Changes to the savings percentages will be made if and when CMS and SCDHHS jointly determine that changes in Part D spending have resulted in materially higher or lower savings that need to be recouped through higher or lower savings percentages applied to the Medicare A/B baselines. 4.4.3.7. Any material changes in the Medicaid State Plan and 1915(c) waivers, including pertaining to Covered Services, payment schedules and related methodologies, shall be reflected in corresponding capitation payment adjustments. The CICO will not be required to implement such changes without Advance Notice and corresponding adjustment in the Capitation Payment. In addition, to the extent other Medicaid costs are incurred absent the Demonstration, such costs shall be reflected in corresponding Capitation Payment adjustments. 4.4.4. Quality Withhold Policy 4.4.4.1. Under the Demonstration, both CMS and SCDHHS will withhold a percentage of their respective components of the Capitation Rate, with the exception of Part D component amounts. The withheld amounts will be repaid subject to the CICO's performance consistent with established quality thresholds. 4.4.4.2. CMS and SCDHHS will evaluate the CICO's performance according to the specified metrics required in order to earn back the quality withhold for a given year. 4.4.4.3. Whether or not the CICO has met the quality requirements in a given year will be made public. 4.4.4.4. Additional details regarding the quality withholds, including more detailed specifications, required thresholds and other information regarding the methodology are available in the Medicare-Medicaid Capitated Financial Alignment Model CMS Core Quality Withhold Technical Notes and South Carolina Quality Withhold Measure Technical Notes. 218 4.4.4.5. Determination of whether the CICO has met required quality withhold requirements will be b ased solely on those measures that can appropriately be calculated based on actual enrollment volume during the demonstration year. 4.4.4.6. Withhold Measures in Demonstration Year 1 4.4.4.6.1. Exhibit 2 below identifies the withhold measures for Demonstration Year 1. Together, these will be utilized as the basis for a one (1) percent withhold. 4.4.4.6.2. Because Demonstration Year 1 crosses calendar and Contract years, the CICO will be evaluated to determine whether it has met required quality withhold requirements at the end of both CY 2015 and CY 2016. The determination in CY 2015 will be based solely on those measures that can appropriately be calculated based on the actual Enrollment volume during CY 2015. Consistent with such evaluations, the withheld amounts will be repaid separately for each calendar year.

Quality Withhold Measures in Demonstration Years 2-8 4.4.4.7.1. The quality withhold will increase to two (2) percent in Demonstration Year 2 and three (3) percent in Demonstration Years 3-8. 219 4.4.4.7.1.1. CMS will apply an additional one (1) percent quality wit hhold to the Medicare A/B rate component starting in Demonstration Year 6. See Section 4.4.4.8 of this Contract for more information. 4.4.4.7.2. Payment will be based on performance on the quality withhold measure s listed in Exhibit 3 Quality Withhold Measures for Demonstration Years 2-8 below. The CICO must report these measures according to the prevailing technical specifications for the applicable measurement year. 4.4.4.7.3. If the CICO is unable to report at least three of the quality withhold measure s listed in Exhibit 3 for a given year due to low enrollment or inability to meet other reporting criteria, alternative measures will be used in the quality withhold analysis.

C.5.5.2 Formal contractual authority and programmatic oversight with HCBS Provider s under the following conditions: C.5.5.3 Readiness: CICOs must meet Benchmark Review Provider sufficiency. 293 C.5.5.3.1 Network adequacy: CICOs must have sufficient Providers in each geographic area sufficient to meet the needs of the target population and to guarantee Enrollees have a meaningful choice of Providers for each service. Since the volume of and need for services differ, the number of Providers will vary by specific services. For instance, more personal care Providers are necessary to cover an area than adult day care providers or home delivered meals Providers. C.5.5.3.2 Provider Contracts : CICOs will use a standard HCBS contract language (i.e., SCDHHS approved scope of services) provided by SCDHHSto ensure consistent continuity of care standards are put into place. C.5.5.3.3 Provider rates : CICOs will be able to set HCBS Provider ra tes using pre-established guidelines from SCDHHS. CICOs must comply with rate floors adjusted annually for each service that will set a minimum reimbursement level. These floors will also allow CICOs to create incentives for performance and quality. Rates that fall below 100 percent of the current FFS level should have a corresponding performance and/or quality incentive that should be reflective of 100 percent of the FFS rate (at a minimum). C.5.5.4 Authority for HCBS service plan development and service authorizations with SCDHHS concurrence. The CICO will exercise its authority by approving or disapproving the recommended service plan and service authorization submitted by the Waiver Case Manager. SCDHHS conveys concurrence with the CICO via signature within SCDHHS's automated Case Management system. An arbitration process through the Demonstration's independent Ombudsman will continue to exist for disputes, should they arise. The Ombudsman will advocate on behalf of the Enrollee's best interest. Please note: SCDHHS will continue to establish a initial service plan during the LOC determination process. This service plan will ensure Enrollees have access to key services (e.g, personal care) prior to a formal request being submitted by the Waiver Case Manager. 294 C.5.5.5 . Self-directed care will be paid by the SCDHHS financial management service Provider. Payments will be reconciled with each CICO through gross level adjustments. C.5.6 CICO Benchmark Review Standards: In order to move to Phase III, the CICOs must demonstrate the following: C.5.6.1 Competency to assume the authority to oversee self-directed attendant care through the: C.5.6.1.1 Incor poration care plans during Phase II; C.5.6.1.2 Capacit y to assess the viability of self-direction for Enrollees; C.5.6.1.3 Abilit y to interface with the University of South Carolina's Center for Disability Resources which provides screening for attendants and employers; and C.5.6.1.4 Ability to promptly and adequately pay attendants. This process will con tinue to flow through SCDHHS's established Electronic Visit Verification and financial management contractor, PPL system. C.5.6.2 Demonstrated understanding of Provider credentialing and monitoring processe s if a CICO elects to assume this optional responsibility. C.6 Phase III: C.6.1 Phase III is marked by the CICO's maturity in HCBS operations and assumption of the remaining HCBS core components, care plan development, service authorization, self-directed attendant care and attendants, many of whom are paid family caregivers. C.6.2 CICO Responsibilities During Phase III: This date will be agreed upon by SCDHHS and CMS based on read iness to move to Phase III. CICOs will assume the following additional responsibilities: C.6.2.1 Responsibility for self-directed attendant care and related functions. C.6.2.2 Independent Provider credentialing and monitoring processes if a CICO elects to assume this option. 29 5 APPENDIX D.
