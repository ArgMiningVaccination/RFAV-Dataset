The content of your Will reflects who you are, what you value, and the contribution you'd like to make to the world after you leave it. I believe - in fact I know - that you will make a profound difference to thousands of Australians if you choose to support medical research into multiple sclerosis (MS) through a gift in your Will. The power of medical research is extraordinary. It has already dramatically changed the trajectory of MS. More medical research, funded and fuelled by the compassion of people like you, will end MS for good and its power over people's lives. Momentum is already building. We will find a cure and we will, in the foreseeable future, be able to prevent MS and reverse its effects. It really is just a matter of time, money, determination - and you. I hope you choose to change the world in this way. You have my promise that any gift you leave to MS Australia will be used to make the best possible difference by investing in our best and brightest researchers. On behalf of every Australian affected by MS, and every researcher working to end it, thank you. Rohan Greenland CEO, MS Australia \"When I was diagnosed with MS, there were no treatments available. Nothing. I just had to let the disease run its natural course. Today there are all kinds of drugs that can help. That progress gives me hope that one day researchers will find a cure. I want my gift to play a part in that.\" - Pearl ChampionDr Simon Murray and Dr Jessica Fletcher are working on a new frontier in MS research - promoting myelin repair in the brain to prevent MS from becoming worse. Your gift in Will could fund future breakthroughs in this exciting field of research - and give great hope to people living with advanced MS.THE POWER OF MEDICAL RESEARCH MS Australia is Australia's national multiple sclerosis (MS) not-for-profit organisation that empowers researchers to identify ways to treat, prevent and cure MS, seeks sustained and systemic policy change via advocacy, and acts as the national champion for Australia's community of people affected by MS. Thanks to the generous support of people like you, and a relentless focus on medical research, we've made incredible progress. We've discovered life-changing treatments and are getting closer to a cure every day. But there's still so much to do. For some Australians living with MS, the symptoms are still going almost unchecked. Others can't plan their futures with confidence. And many live in fear of relapse or recurrence. Most concerning though, is that more Australians are diagnosed with MS every year. The vast majority of them are women. Medical research has brought us so far already. So we're certain that, one day, we'll find a cure. By leaving a gift in your Will, you'll accelerate that progress, fast track the breakthroughs that'll have the most impact, and put a complete stop to MS. Forever. With a gift in your Will, you'll fuel pioneering research into MS. And bring us closer to the day when we can: Treat every person living with MS, without exception. Stop the progress of MS, for good. Reverse MS and give back what people have lost. Prevent MS for those most likely to develop the disease. Find a cure, and make MS a thing of the past.Medical research has been behind every significant advance in MS treatment and care. People like you have been behind every breakthrough. THE WORLD YOU CAN CREATE Research into MS has come a long way in the last decade. After diagnosis, more people are living longer, fuller lives than ever before. But Lauren's story proves we still have a long way to go. When she was just 25 years old, Lauren's neurologist broke the news: she had MS. Lauren was devastated. On the way back to the car with her mum, she burst into tears. Soon afterwards, her treatment began. Her body rejected five consecutive therapies, and as the list of potential side effects grew longer and longer, Lauren became worried. She was afraid she would never be able to have children. \"It was all I'd ever wanted - ever since I was a kid in kindergarten and the teacher asked us all what we wanted to be when we grew up: I said, 'a mum'\", Lauren remembered. But Lauren was determined MS wouldn't take away her dream. Although she didn't have a partner, she had no time to lose. So with the support of her family, she made the bold step of starting IVF. Lauren now has a beautiful baby boy named Bailey. But she's still living with MS, so uncertainty about her future (and Bailey's) is a large part of her life. Your gift will help change that. You'll help create a world where nobody is limited by MS. And by including MS Australia in your Will, you'll help power the search for cures and treatments for people just like Lauren - and give her and her family the future they deserve.You can give people like Lauren freedom to choose, plan and dream.Australia is seeing a year-on-year increase in the number of women newly diagnosed with MS. Your gift can help researchers find out why, and develop treatments that will allow young women like Lauren to get on with their lives, free from MS.\"I have always promised myself that I will never give up investigating the devastating disease that my grandfather lived with for most of his life.\"- Dr Steven PetratosAfter losing his grandad to MS, Dr Steven Petratos is determined to make sure no family experiences the same loss he did. He's certain there are life-changing new MS treatments on the horizon - all we need is more research. Right now, Dr Petratos is working on 'progressive MS'; the form of the disease with the fewest treatment options and the worst outcomes. But Dr Petratos is dedicated. And thanks to his hard work, a new treatment may be just around the corner. To make it a reality, he needs more funding. When you leave a gift in your Will, you'll be supporting tireless researchers like Dr Petratos and making sure their work never slows. You'll help build teams of the brightest minds in the world, and help focus all their energies on finding a cure. And you'll make sure every breakthrough leads to another one, even bigger than the last. Your gift will help beat MS, in so many ways, including: Helping researchers make the next big breakthrough. Providing seed funding for the most innovative scientific ideas. Supporting clinical trials to treat MS now, and pave the way for better treatments in the future. Sending Australian research global and enabling worldwide collaborations. Providing scholarships to the brightest up-and-coming researchers, with the freshest thinking.THE RESEARCH - AND THE RESEARCHERS For this researcher, it's personal.\"I hope my gift will achieve a positive change in the future for other people diagnosed with MS.\" - Meg McIntyreYOU'LL BE IN GOOD COMPANY Meg was a talented hockey player, and at the peak of her career as a Sports Physiotherapist, when she was diagnosed with MS. At first, the disease didn't slow her down. She continued to work as a physio for the Australian Women's Hockey and Cricket teams. She kept up with her hockey, snow skiing and athletics. She even cycled across China to raise funds for people living with MS. But over the years, MS has gradually taken away more of Meg's energy and mobility. She retired last year and today often needs a cane to walk. \"As time has gone by, I don't have the same energy for fundraising. So I decided to leave a gift in my Will to make a difference. Ultimately, I hope we can predict MS before it happens, as well as cure it and repair the damage it causes.\"\"It would be lovely if the money I leave is the actual dollar that flicks the switch that finds the cure for MS!\" - Gilli Barnard \"When I took up fundraising, I hoped they'd find a cure for MS before I die. That may not happen, but I know leaving a gift in my Will means the search will continue. I feel comfortable and happy my Will isn't going to just one person but will make a difference for thousands of individuals living with MS.\"Gilli Barnard moved to Australia as a \"10 pound pom\" in 1966, aged 19. She had her first episode of MS in 1970. Gilli is an active and dedicated fundraiser for MS Australia. She's regularly at Hobart's Salamanca Market, sharing a joke and collecting spare change from tourists. Despite the challenges of living with MS, Gilli is an endlessly positive person who is determined to help others. By including MS Australia in your Will, you'll join a wonderful community of people passionate about finding a cure.

Having an up-to-date Will means you can decide which people and causes receive your assets after you pass away. Without one, they may go to someone you wouldn't have chosen yourself. Is it expensive or difficult to include MS Australia in my Will? Not at all. If you already have a Will, you simply need to get in touch with your solicitor and include an extra sentence about your gift. And if you'd like any help with the wording, or have questions about how to update your Will, we're happy to help. Can I change my existing Will to include you? Absolutely. Updating your Will to include a gift to MS Australia is quick and inexpensive. Though we recommend you use a solicitor to do so. Can I look after those closest to me and still include a gift to MS Australia? Of course - your loved ones should always be your priority. For that reason, most of our supporters choose to leave a 'residual gift' - a small percentage of the residue of their estate after family and loved ones have been taken care of. With a residual gift, the percentage you allocate to charity stays the same, even if the value of your estate changes.IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS So where do you start? Possibly with some answers to frequently asked questions.Two important things to consider when amending your Will: 1. Use a solicitor to make sure things are exactly as you want them 2. Include the correct details so your gift goes to: MS Australia (ABN: 51 008 515 508)Is there a minimum amount I can leave? Every gift will make a difference, and the amount you choose to leave is completely up to you. A residual gift (explained in brief on the opposite page) is an excellent way to make a difference, regardless of the value of your estate. You can also choose to leave a specific dollar-amount or anything of value - such as real estate, jewellery or shares. Associate Professor Yasmine Probst is researching the links between MS and nutrition. She hopes to help people with MS manage their disease through lifestyle changes. Your gift could fund this important area of research and also help Yasmine herself. She is one of several MS researchers who lives with MS.
