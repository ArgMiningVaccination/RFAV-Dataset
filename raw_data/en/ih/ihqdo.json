Blessings and love on your journey of life and ascension, Eve The Healer & Ascension Certification Course began in 1986 as The Healer Development Program and what an adventure it has been! It was conceived when my healing clients asked me to teach what I do. Since what I do is completely inspired in the moment by creating unity between my client, their Higher Self and the essence of truth of God, I approached teaching the same way. Always working with my current set of students, I would adjust my teaching to their needs and expanding abilities. What came of that was a lightly structured system of spiritual healing that continued to evolve as the potentials of our world grew, which they have done in amazing ways.
