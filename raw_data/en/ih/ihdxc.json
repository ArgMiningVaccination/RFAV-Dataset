Regular chiropractic care and adjustments encourage spinal health, restore joint function, and therefore support the nervous system. As a result of improved function and mobility in your spine and body, you can actually boost your immune system. Here at Tannenbaum Chiropractic in Beverly Hills, we emphasize full body well-being. This includes strengthening your immune system through natural care practices like spinal correction and adjustments, decompression, structural integration, massage therapy and acupuncture in Beverly Hills. By integrating these practices into your regular health routine, you can enjoy a healthy immune system with the benefits of physiological stress relief. Your Immune System is Directly Related to Your Spine Your [nervous system communicates](http://www.chiropractic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ICA-Report-on-Immune-Function-and-Chiropractic-3-20-20.pdf) with the rest of your body through the spinal cord. This means that when your spine is damaged or misaligned, there is an interference with that path of communication, causing pain symptoms and increasing your chances of injury or illness. Your immune system may suffer from this compression of nerve pathways, weakening your body's natural mechanisms for fighting off illness. As a result, [studies have shown](https://lesterchiropracticny.com/boosting-immunity/) that chiropractic care designed to relieve stress, pain, and misalignment of the spine improves nerve function and can potentially boost your immune system by 200%. Stress Impacts Your Immune System, and Your Body Can Harbor Stress in the Spine [Research shows](https://www.apa.org/research/action/immune) that stress weakens the immune system: the state of mind affects one's state of health. Stress-related back pain is one of the most common psychosomatic symptoms, because many people tend to carry the stress in their shoulders, neck, and backs. Heightened stress levels can therefore compound with regular back pain complaints, gravely affecting your immune system and leaving you more suspectable both emotionally and physically. While chiropractic care cannot actively cure disease or infection, like other preventative care health practices, a visit with a chiropractor can help strengthen your body's natural ability to heal and recover from both illness and injury, should it occur. Chiropractic Care and Preventative Care Understanding your bodily function is imperative. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html) has recently offered several advisory measures in maintaining mental, physical, and immune health during this pandemic crisis. As there are no cures or accepted health approaches for COVID-19 yet, the best we can do at the present time is honor our bodies with preventative care measures that boost our immune systems and focus on full-body wellness. Optimizing your spinal health and full-body function through chiropractic care can increase your emotional and physical health and wellbeing.
