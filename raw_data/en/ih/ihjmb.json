She is diagnosed with an intestinal infection, given intravenous fluids and aprescription for a fluoroquinolone\u2014an antibiotic\u2014and is sent home. Day 2 At a Massachusetts hospital's emergency room, a 2-year-old boy with a severe case of diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and fever is given fluids and administered a cephalosporin, another type of antibiotic, and isadmitted to the hospital. Day 4 The boy's lab results come back identifying the cause of his illness as Salmonella , a common foodborne bacterial infection, but, in this instance, the \"bug\" is highly resistant to the antibiotics commonly used to treat suchinfections, including cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. The baby boy dies of dehydration and bloodstream infection. As for the 34-year-old woman, the Salmonella infection results in a miscarriage of an otherwise normal baby followed by the woman's death. Day 5 325 people are dead. Thousands\u2014many of them children, the elderly, and other vulnerable individuals\u2014jam emergency rooms across the Northeast complaining of similar symptoms. Cases have been reported in 15 statesalong the East Coast and in the Mid-Atlantic region. Isolated cases are reported in other states, including Texasand California. Fourteen cases are reported in Mexico and 27 cases in Canada. Day 6 1,730 deaths and 220,000 illnesses have occurred in the United States. The epidemic expands in other countries. Canada, Mexico, and Europe close their borders to U.S. food imports, and travel initiated from the United States is banned around the globe. Economic losses to the U.S. and global economies soon reach tens of billions of dollars. The Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identifiy the source of the infections as a milk distribution facility located in New York state. They confirm that the Salmonella not only causes severe illness, but also is resistant to all available antibiotics. Doctors can only provide supportive care, notspecific, antibiotic treatment. Day 7 The number of deaths and illnesses continues to climb. Think it can't happen? Think again. In 1985, milk contaminated with Salmonella typhimurium infected 200,000 people across the Midwest. What distinguishes that case from our scenario is the development of a fully antibiotic-resistant strainof the bacteria as compared to the one that is only partially drug-resistant. Such \"bad bugs\" are evolving. Some arealready here. Had bioterrorism prompted this scenario, infection rates could have been significantly higher, as several sources could have been intentionally contaminated. The toll on human lives and the U.S. economy would have beensubstantially worse. Can we avert this catastrophe? If we act now, the answer is yes. 1 THENEXTEPIDEMIC BEGINS... 2 The Next Cases of Hospital-Acquired Infections Caused by Selected Resistant Bacteria in the United States in 2002 . . . .9 History of Why We Are Concerned Antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs have saved millions of lives and eased patients' suffering. Althoughthey have been dubbed \"miracle drugs,\" antibiotics arenot always effective. Over time, bacteria can developresistance to existing drugs, making infections difficult ifnot impossible to treat. A multi-pronged approach is needed to limit the impact of antibiotic resistance on patients and the public. Theseefforts include educating physicians, patients, and parentsabout the appropriate use of antibiotics, developing andapplying infection control and immunization policies andpractices to prevent transmission, surveying clinical andprescription data, and developing safer alternatives toantibiotic uses in agriculture. The purpose of this document, however, is to call attention to a frightening twist in the antibiotic resistanceproblem that has not received adequate attention fromfederal policymakers: The pharmaceutical pipeline for newantibiotics is drying up. Until recently, research and development (R&D) efforts have provided new drugs in time to treat bacteria thatbecame resistant to older antibiotics. That is no longer thecase. Unfortunately, both the public and private sectorsappear to have been lulled into a false sense of securitybased on past successes. The potential crisis at hand is theresult of a marked decrease in industry R&D, governmentinaction, and the increasing prevalence of resistantbacteria. Infectious diseases physicians are alarmed by theprospect that effective antibiotics may not be available totreat seriously ill patients in the near future. Why Policymakers Should be Concerned Too Policymakers already have recognized the urgent need to spur R&D related to biodefense. While this concern isappropriate, it is important to keep things in perspective.There has not been a single case of smallpox anywhere on the planet since the 1970s, but drug-resistant bacterialinfections kill tens of thousands of Americans every year,and an epidemic could harm millions. Why should policymakers care about antibiotic resistance and the lack of new antibiotics to treatresistant infections? Infections caused by resistant bacteria can strike anyone\u2014the young and the old, the healthy and thechronically ill. Antibiotic resistance is a particularlyserious problem for patients whose immune systemsare compromised, such as people with HIV/AIDS andpatients in critical care units. About 2 million people acquire bacterial infections in U.S. hospitals each year, and 90,000 die as a result.About 70 percent of those infections are resistant to atleast one drug. The trends toward increasing numbersof infection and increasing drug resistance show nosign of abating. Resistant pathogens lead to higher health care costs because they often require more expensive drugs andextended hospital stays. The total cost to U.S. society isnearly $5 billion annually. The pipeline of new antibiotics is drying up. Major pharmaceutical companies are losing interest in the antibiotics market because these drugs simply are notas profitable as drugs that treat chronic (long-term)conditions and lifestyle issues. Drug R&D is expensive, risky, and time-consuming. An aggressive R&D program initiated today would likelyrequire 10 or more years and an investment of $800million to $1.7 billion to bring a new drug to market. Resistant bacterial infections are not only a public health problem; they have national and global securityimplications as well. The Institute of Medicine and federal officials have identified antibiotic resistance and the dearth of antibiotic R&D as increasing threats to U.S. public health. 3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 4IDSA's Investigation IDSA has investigated the decline in new antibiotic R&D for more than a year, interviewing stakeholders from allsectors. Society leaders have met with officials from theFood and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Instituteof Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), congressionalmembers and staff, executives from leadingpharmaceutical and biotechnology companies,representatives from public-private partnerships that arefocused on infectious diseases-related productdevelopment, patients, and other stakeholders. Eachstakeholder has an important role in furthering futureantibiotic discovery and development and limiting theimpact of antibiotic resistance. However, based upon pastsuccesses, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industriesare clearly best situated to take the lead in developing thenew antibiotics needed to treat bacterial diseases. As such,industry action must become the central focus of aninnovative federal public health effort designed tostimulate antibiotic R&D. IDSA's investigation has revealed that the incentives most likely to spur R&D within major pharmaceutical companiesinclude those that provide financial benefits prior to adrug's approval (e.g., tax credits for R&D), commence atthe time of approval (e.g., wild-card patent extension),reduce the costs of clinical trials (e.g., FDA flexibilityconcerning the evidence necessary to demonstrate safetyand efficacy; NIAID-sponsored research to develop rapiddiagnostics tests, etc.), and reduce companies' risks (e.g.,liability protections). R&D at smaller biotechnologycompanies also could be stimulated through statutory andadministrative changes. Finally, new funding for criticalfederal public health programs, and public and privateresearch efforts, would help to ensure progress as well aslimit the public health impact of antibiotic resistance. Following is a list of specific potential legislative solutions, administrative recommendations, and funding requests: Potential Legislative Solutions To Fuel Innovation Congress and the Administration must work together to enact statutory incentives that stimulate the discovery anddevelopment of new antibiotics to treat drug-resistant andother dangerous infections. Critical priority incentives thatwill have the greatest impact are indicated. Commission to Prioritize Antimicrobial Discovery Establish and empower an independent Commission to Prioritize Antimicrobial Discovery to decide which infectiouspathogens to target using these legislative R&D incentivesand administrative solutions: Supplemental intellectual property protections: \"Wild-card patent extension.\" A company that develops andreceives approval for a priority antibiotic could extendthe market exclusivity period of another FDA-approveddrug as long as the company commits to invest aportion of the profits derived during the extensionperiod back into antibiotic R&D. Restoration of all patent time lost during FDA's review of priority antibiotics Extended market exclusivity similar to what has been successfully implemented for pediatric and orphan drugs Other potential statutory incentives: Tax incentives for R&D of priority antibiotics Measured liability protections Additional statutory flexibility at FDA regarding approval of antibiotics, as needed Antitrust exemptions for certain company communications A guaranteed market CRITICAL PRIORITY CRITICAL PRIORITY CRITICAL PRIORITY CRITICAL PRIORITY Establish similar statutory incentives to spur R&D for rapid diagnostic tests for targeted pathogens, which will help to reduce the cost of clinical trials Potential statutory incentives of interest to small biopharmaceutical companies: Waive FDA supplemental application user fees for priority antibiotics Tax credits specifically targeting this segment of the industry Small business grants In addition to enacting statutory incentives to spur antibiotic R&D, Congress should work with theAdministration to implement administrativerecommendations at FDA and NIAID. Food and Drug Administration Recommendations FDA is a pivotal and constructive partner in the process of antibiotic development. In order to effectively implementFDA's plan, Innovation or Stagnation: Challenge and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New Medical Products , modifications to existing policy, procedures, and guidelinesare necessary. Each of the following recommendations is acritical priority: Accelerate the publication of updated guidelines for antibiotic clinical trials to provide needed clarity, andrevisit existing guidelines as appropriate to ensure theirrelevance Encourage imaginative clinical trial designs that lead to a better understanding of drug efficacy againstresistant bacterial pathogens Provide a clear definition of acceptable surrogate markers as end points for clinical trials of bacterialinfections Explore and, when appropriate, encourage the use of animal models of infection, in vitro technologies, andvalid microbiologic surrogate markers to reduce thenumber of efficacy studies required for each additional indication while maintaining safe and effective drug dose regimens Explore with NIAID all opportunities to streamline antibiotic drug development Grant priority antibioticsacceleratedreview status 5 In 2002, out of 89 new drugs, no new antibioticswere approved. Drug-resistant infections canstrike anyone,even healthychildren.July 1997. A 7-year-old girl from urban Minnesota was admitted to a hospital with aninfected right hip joint. Doctors drained theinfected joint and treated the girl with theantibiotic cefazolin. On the third day of herhospital stay, tests showed the girl wasinfected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and the doctors changed her antibiotic to vancomycin,but it was too late: The infection had alreadyinvaded too deeply into her lungs. The girlsuffered respiratory failure that day and wasplaced on a ventilator. After five weeks in thehospital, she died from a lung hemorrhage.This girl was previously healthy with norecent hospitalizations. CRITICAL PRIORITIES National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Recommendations NIAID could play a central role in the R&D process. To do so, NIAID should implement the following recommendations.Each is a critical priority: Aggressively encourage translational (bench to bedside) research as described in NIH's Roadmap for Medical Research Remove roadblocks to antibiotic R&D that may exist in NIAID's structure and guidelines, including anyunnecessary restrictions affecting companies'intellectual property rights Increase the number and size of grants that support discovery of new drugs that treat targeted pathogens Develop and expand collaborations with industry and the infectious diseases research community Sufficiently fund and rapidly launch NIAID's newly established Drug Discovery and Mechanisms ofAntimicrobial Resistance Study Section Engage outside experts in research planning and ensure more transparent decision-making Explore with FDA all opportunities to streamline antibiotic drug development Encourage research on topics directly related to conduct of clinical trials Sponsor research into new rapid diagnostic tests for bacterial infections that, when available, could reduce the cost of clinical trials Encourage research on antibiotic use and resistance development Fund placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the necessity of antibiotic therapy for selected diseases New Funding Needed The increasing threat of drug resistance, concomitant with decreasing antibiotic R&D, requires a dramatic increase inpublic funding for CDC, FDA, NIAID, and public-privateresearch efforts. At a minimum, Congress and theAdministration must work together to invest new resources (i.e., not shift funds from other public health efforts) into the following critical program areas: Double CDC's antimicrobial resistance program funding to $50 million in 2005 and continue to increase it by $25 million increments until 2009 to atotal of $150 million Increase FDA's funding by $25 million to support implementation of the Critical Path plan (which would help decrease the cost of antibiotic development), thedevelopment of new antibiotic guidelines, and tospeed antibiotic reviews Significantly increase NIAID's translational and antibiotic resistance research efforts Support synergistic public/private partnerships that focus on infectious diseases medicines Conclusion Without innovative public policy and additional financial support, fewer and fewer antibiotics will be available totreat the increasing number of drug-resistant anddangerous microbes that threaten Americans and theglobal community. The proposals advanced in thisdocument are intended to ensure a sustainable supply ofsafe and effective antibiotics to protect the public's health. We urge policymakers to act quickly. 6 CRITICAL PRIORITIES \"Infectious diseases physicians are alarmed by the prospect that effective antibiotics may not beavailable to treat seriously ill patients in the near future. There simply aren't enoughnew drugs in thepharmaceutical pipeline to keep pace with drug- resistant bacterial infections, so-called 'superbugs.'\" Joseph R. Dalovisio, MD IDSA President As Antibiotic Discovery Stagnates ... A Public Health Crisis BrewsBADBUGS, NODRUGS 8 9 RESISTANCE ON THE RISE Antibiotics* have saved millions of lives and eased the suffering of patients of all ages for more than 60 years.These \"wonder drugs\" deserve much of the credit forthe dramatic increase in life expectancy in the UnitedStates and around the world in the 20th century. Theyprevent amputations and blindness, advance our abilityto perform surgery, enable new cancer treatments to beused, and protect the lives of our military men andwomen. A famous infectious disease expert once notedthat the discovery of penicillin in the early 1940s gavemore curative power to a lone provider than thecollective talent of all the physicians in New York City atthat time. Unfortunately, it is inevitable that, over time,bacteria develop resistance to existing antibiotics, makinginfections more difficult to treat. Antibiotic resistance is not a new phenomenon. National surveillance data and independent studies show that drug-resistant, disease-causing bacteria have multiplied andspread at alarming rates in recent decades. A diverse rangeof patients is affected. The Institute of Medicine (IOM),Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) warn that drug-resistant bacteria area serious public health threat, especially considering thatthere are few novel drugs in the pipeline to combat them. Infections that were once easily curable with antibiotics are becoming difficult, even impossible, to treat, and anincreasing number of people are suffering severe illness\u2014or dying\u2014as a result. This year, nearly 2 million people inthe United States will acquire bacterial infections while inthe hospital, and about 90,000 of them will die, accordingto CDC estimates. More than 70 percent of the bacteriathat cause these infections will be resistant to at least oneof the drugs commonly used to fight them. (See Table 1.) In a growing and frightening number of cases, thesebacteria are resistant to many approved drugs, andpatients have to be treated with new, investigationalcompounds or older, toxic alternatives. For many patients,there simply are no drugs that work. The resistance problem \"has probably been smoldering for years, but recently it's almost like a switch got triggered,\"medical professor Stuart H. Cohen, MD, of the University ofCalifornia, Davis, recently told the Wall Street Journal . \"Antibiotic resistance is increasing too quickly and in too many organisms,\" said Harvard Medical School pediatricinfectious disease specialist Jonathan Finkelstein, MD, inthe same article. Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Estimated Cases Methicillin/ S. aureus Methicillin/CNS 130,000 Vancomycin/enterococci 26,000 Ceftazidime/ P. aeruginosa 16,000 Ceftazidime/ K. pneumoniae 11,000Table 1: Estimated Cases of Hospital- Acquired Infections Caused by Selected Resistant Bacteria in the United States in 2002 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion These preliminary estimates were extrapolated by CDC staff from data collected from hospitals that participatein the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System. NNIS hospitals are disproportionately large,urban, and affiliated with medical schools and are morelikely to have more seriously ill patients. As such, these estimates should be interpreted cautiously. CNS=Coagulase-negative staphylococci *Antibiotics are a type of antimicrobial, a broad term used to describe any agent that inhibits the growth of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, yeast, protozoa, and parasites.Antibiotics target bacteria\u2014the \"bad bugs\" addressed in thispaper. Bacteria are by far the most common cause of infectiousdiseases-related deaths in the United States. According to IOM and FDA, only two new classes of antibiotics have been developed in the past 30 years, andresistance to one class emerged even before FDA approvedthe drug. (See Table 2.) Furthermore, some strains of resistant bacteria are no longer confined to hospitals and are occurring in otherwisehealthy individuals in communities across the United Statesand other countries. As resistant bacteria multiply, so does the burden they place on our health care system. The economic cost hasreached billions of dollars annually in the United States,according to estimates from IOM and the formerCongressional Office of Technology Assessment. Thehuman cost in terms of pain, grief, and suffering,however, is incalculable. Fast-Moving Targets To understand how quickly disease-causing bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics, take the example of Staphylococcus aureus (staph), a common cause of hospital infections that can spread to the heart, bones, lungs, andbloodstream with fatal results. Penicillin, introduced in theearly 1940s, once kept staph bacteria at bay. However,penicillin-resistant staph bacteria were identified as early as1942. By the late 1960s, more than 80 percent of staphbacteria were penicillin-resistant. Methicillin was introducedin 1961 to combat resistant staph bacteria, but reports ofmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rapidly followed. In 1974, 2 percent of the staph bacteria found inU.S. hospitals were methicillin-resistant. By 2002, that figurehad jumped to 57.1 percent, according to CDC data. (SeeChart 1 and Table 3.) Staph infections have acquired resistance to many other drugs in addition to penicillin and methicillin. In fact,according to CDC, about half of the identified MRSAstrains in U.S. hospitals are resistant to all but a fewantibiotics. Causing even greater alarm, staph bacteriapartially resistant to vancomycin, a drug of last resort inthe treatment of several resistant infections, werediscovered in patients in the late 1990s. Two cases of fullyvancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) were reported in 2002 and a third in 2004. MRSA is no longer a problem confined to hospitals. One ongoing study of children with community-acquired staphinfections at the University of Texas has found nearly 70percent infected with MRSA. In a 2002 outbreak, 235MRSA infections were reported among military recruits ata training facility in the southeastern United States. Inaddition, a total of 12,000 cases of community-acquiredMRSA were found in three correctional facilities (Georgia,California, and Texas) between 2001 and 2003. 10 Table 2: History of Antibiotic Discovery and Approval Source: Food and Drug Administration (modified) Presented by John H. Powers, MD, at April 15-16, 2004 \"Antimicrobial Drug Development Workshop,\" co-sponsored by FDA, IDSA, and the InternationalSociety of Anti-Infective Pharmacology.Year Introduced Class of Drug 1935 Sulfonamides Trimethoprim 2000 Oxazolidinones 2003 Lipopeptides Other resistant bacterial infections also are raising significant public health concerns: In 1998, IOM reported an alarming rise in the incidence of infections due to a bacterium calledenterococcus, which causes wound infections,infections in blood, the urinary tract and heart, andlife-threatening infections acquired in hospitals.Vancomycin has been a core treatment forenterococci. The percentage of enterococci resistant tovancomycin (VRE) has been increasing dramaticallysince the late 1980s, according to CDC. In 2002, morethan 27 percent of tested enterococci samples fromintensive care units were resistant to vancomycin. (SeeChart 1 and Table 3.) The percentage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria resistant to either ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin, twocommon antibiotics of the fluoroquinolone class(FQRP), has increased dramatically from the late 1980sto the present. Recent CDC data show that in 2002,nearly 33 percent of tested samples from intensivecare units were resistant to fluoroquinolones. P. aeruginosa causes infections of the urinary tract, lungs, and wounds and other infections commonly found inintensive care units. (See Chart 1 and Table 3.) 11 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000Year% IncidenceMRSA VRE FQRPChart 1: Resistant Strains Spread Rapidly Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention This chart shows the increase in rates of resistance for three bacteria that are of concern to public health officials: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aeruginosa (FQRP).

Drug/Pathogen Resistance (%) Methicillin/ S. aureus 57.1 3: of Drug Resistance in Hospital-Acquired Infections in 2002 Source: CDC National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System, August 2003 for all, except penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae , which is the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance of the Emerging Infections Network. This table provides a snapshot of selected drug-resistant pathogens associated with hospital infections in intensive care unit patients during 2002. CNS=Coagulase-negativestaphylococci; 3rd Ceph=resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most feared bacterium that causes pneumonia. S. pneumoniae strains that are resistant to penicillin and other drugs are emerging rapidly in the United States. Up to 40percent of infections caused by this bacterium areresistant to at least one drug, and 15 percent areresistant to three or more drugs, the CDC reports.Aside from 100,000 cases of pneumonia each year,this bacterium causes childhood ear infections (6million per year), meningitis (3,300 per year), andsinusitis (thousands of cases). Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter , a type of bacteria that has caused stubborn wound infections in U.S.soldiers and civilians stationed in Iraq, has beenincreasingly reported worldwide. Pneumonia due to Acinetobacter infections is now considered one of the most difficult hospital-acquired infections to controland treat, according to a recent study in Clinical Infectious Diseases (CID) . An international surveillance study, also reported in CID, tested hundreds of Acinetobacter samples and found various levels of resistance to 15 drugs. Some Acinetobacter strains are resistant to virtually every available drug with theexception of one toxic antibiotic that causessubstantial side effects. Salmonellosis, a common foodborne infection thatcauses diarrhea, can causeserious illness and death.Nationally, the incidence of Salmonella bacteria resistant to cephalosporins, anantibiotic commonly used totreat severe salmonellosis, rosenearly fivefold (from 0.5percent to 2.4 percent)between 1998 and 2001,according to a study publishedin the Journal of Infectious Diseases . In Massachusetts during the same time period,the prevalence of drug-resistant Salmonella rose from 0 percent to 53 percent. Tuberculosis (TB) is becoming increasingly difficult to treat. The World Health Organization estimates that up to 50 million people worldwide may be infectedwith drug-resistant strains of TB. Treatment forresistant TB strains can take up to 24 months, asopposed to the six months generally required to treat non-resistant strains. 12 Many athletes have developed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcusaureus (MRSA), which can infectthe heart, bones, lungs, andbloodstream.Since 2000, CDC has reported a new phenomenon\u2014community-acquired outbreaksof MRSA among athletes, including collegefootball players in Pennsylvania, wrestlers inIndiana, and a fencing club in Colorado. Publichealth officials believe that physical contactand the sharing of clothing or equipmentprobably leads to the spread of infection inthese otherwise healthy people. In Septemberof 2003, this issue was brought to national attention when MRSA brokeout in Florida among theMiami Dolphins, sendingtwo players to the hospitalfor treatment. The Human Toll Statistics cannot convey the human toll that resistant organisms take on their victims. Throughout this paper arestories of previously healthy people who became seriouslyill or died as a result of drug-resistant infections. Theseexamples, reported by the CDC, the media, and infectiousdiseases physicians, show that resistant infection can strikeanyone, at any time. They serve as examples of what anincreasing number of Americans could face as a result ofthe impending public health crisis. The Economic Bur den Drug-resistant bacteria impose an economic burden on the United States on the order of billions of dollars annually,according to several authoritative analyses. Drug-resistantinfections are significantly more expensive to treat thannon-resistant infections because of longer hospitalizations,extra physician visits, the higher cost of alternativeantibiotics, more post-hospital care, lost work days, anddeaths. For example, resistant TB strains are as much as100 times more expensive to treat than non-resistantstrains, according to Lee B. Reichman, MD, MPH, directorof the New Jersey Medical School National TuberculosisCenter. MRSA infections cost an average of $31,400 percase to treat compared to $27,700 per case for non-resistant infections, according to a study cited in the IOMreport Antimicrobial Resistance: Issues and Options (1998) . The same IOM report estimated that the total cost to U.S. society of antimicrobial resistance was at least $4 billion to$5 billion annually. A 1995 cost analysis by the formerCongressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA)provided similar dollar estimates when factors such as thecosts of lost work days and costs for post-hospital care areconsidered. OTA went further to say that \"these costs canbe expected to increase rapidly as the numbers ofantibiotic resistant bacteria increase.\"A multi-pronged approach is essential to limit the impact of antibiotic resistance on patients and public health. Goodantibiotic stewardship, infection control and preventionefforts, increased surveillance, and limits on agriculturaluses of antibiotics are extremely important. But a morepressing concern is that, as the number of resistantpathogens continues to grow, the pipeline of antibioticsused to treat these \"bad bugs\" is quickly drying up. 13 Patients with Compromised Immune Systems at Greater Risk Antibiotic resistance is a serious problem for peoplewith compromised immune systems, includingpatients in hospital critical care units and the 40million people living with HIV/AIDS in the UnitedStates and globally. Their weakened immune systemsmake these patients particularly vulnerable to drug-resistant and other bacterial infections. A recent studypublished in Clinical Infectious Diseases has shown that the very patients most vulnerable to thedevastating impact of resistant infections\u2014those withcompromised immune systems\u2014also are more likelythan other patients to be infected with resistantpathogens. Furthermore, in many areas of the world,patients infected with HIV are more likely to die as aresult of bacterial infections, such as tuberculosis,than of the underlying HIV infection. A wider array ofantibiotics that treat bacterial infections\u2014particularlydrug-resistant strains\u2014could offer significant hope topeople with compromised immune systems. 14 In spite of the pressing need for new drugs to treat resistant infections, there simply are not enough newantibiotics in the pharmaceutical pipeline to keep pace.Major pharmaceutical companies with the R&D \"muscle\"to make progress are losing interest in the antibioticsmarket, even as they increase their overall R&D budgets.Of greatest concern is the dearth of resources beinginvested in drug discovery. The trend started more than 10 years ago. In 1990, half of the large pharmaceutical companies in the United Statesand Japan reported that they had halted or significantlydecreased their antibiotic discovery efforts. That same year,several companies attempted to get back into the market,spurred on by worsening problems with MRSA and a VREoutbreak. But the enthusiasm was short-lived. In 2000,Roche announced that it was spinning off its anti-infectivediscovery division. In 2002, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company,Abbott Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, and Wyeth allhalted or substantially reduced their anti-infective discoveryefforts, and Aventis announced plans to spin off its anti-infectives division. Procter & Gamble also appears to bewithdrawing from new antibiotic R&D. Other companiesappear to have decreased the number of employeesassigned to antibiotic discovery and development. An article in the January-February 2004 issue of Health Affairs described the impact of these reductions on the ability of pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugsto target antibiotic resistance: \"Today there are fewchampions for the study of infectious diseasesmechanisms, and few within the industry are able tointerpret the epidemiological data in a way that translatesinto business decisions.\" Companies' efforts to downsize antibiotic R&D activities have had a notable impact on the number of antibioticsmoving through the pipeline. A recent analysis published in Clinical Infectious Diseases found only five new antibiotics in the R&D pipeline out of more than 506 drugs in development.* The authorsevaluated the websites or 2002 annual reports of 15 major pharmaceutical companies with a track record inantibiotic development and seven major biotechnologycompanies.** Their analysis revealed four new antibioticsbeing developed by pharmaceutical companies, and onlyone antibiotic being developed by a biotech company. Bycomparison, the analysis found that the pharmaceuticalcompanies were developing 67 new drugs for cancer, THEPIPELINE OF NEWANTIBIOTICS ISDRYING UP A growing number of drug companies appear to bewithdrawing from newantibiotic research anddevelopment. April 2004. blood culturesgrew Acinetobacter that was resistant to all antibiotics except colistin, a drug rarely usedbecause it is very toxic. He died.*\"Development\" in this context refers to phases 2 and 3 of human testing\u2014the later stages of the R&D process. **Pharmaceutical companies examined were Merck & Co., Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Aventis, Pharmacia, Novartis, Wyeth, Eli and Bayer. Biotech companies were Amgen,Genentech, Applera, Genzyme, Serono, Chiron, and Biogen.The authors' list of new drugs in the pipeline also includedtelithromycin, which was subsequently approved by FDA. 33 for inflammation/pain, 34 for metabolic/endocrine disorders, and 32 for pulmonary disease. The biotechcompanies were developing 24 drugs for inflammation/immunomodulators, 14 drugs for metabolic/endocrinedisorders, and 13 for cancer. The end result of the decline in antibiotic discovery research is that FDA is approving few new antibiotics.Since 1998, only 10 new antibiotics have been approved,two of which are truly novel\u2014i.e., defined as having anew target of action, with no cross-resistance with otherantibiotics. In 2002, among 89 new medicines emergingon the market, none was an antibiotic. IOM's 2003 report on microbial threats reinforces the point, noting that although at first glance the situationwith respect to antibiotics currently in clinicaldevelopment looks encouraging, not one new class of antibiotics is in late-stage development. \"Rather these'new' antibiotics belong to existing classes, includingmacrolides and quinolones, that have been used to treathumans for years,\" IOM said. Infectious disease experts are particularly concerned about the dearth of new \"narrow-spectrum\" agents\u2014that is,drugs that fight a specific infectious organism. Many of theantibiotics in development today are \"broad-spectrum\"\u2014meaning they are intended to work against a wide rangeof organisms\u2014which are more likely to contribute to thedevelopment of resistance. 15 Antibacterial Year Novel rifapentine 1998 No quinupristin/dalfopristin 1999 No moxifloxacin 1999 No gatifloxacin 1999 No linezolid 2000 Yes cefditoren pivoxil 2001 No ertapenem 2001 No gemifloxacin 2003 No daptomycin 2003 Yes telithromycin 2004 NoTable 4: New Antibacterial Agents Approved Since 1998 Source: Spellberg et al., Clinical Infectious Diseases , May 1, 2004 (modified) Source: Spellberg et al., Clinical Infectious Diseases , May 1, 2004 (modified)Chart 2: Antibacterial Agents Approved, 1983-2004 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 1983-1987 1988-1992 1993-1997 1998-2002 2003-2004Total # New Antibacterial Agents (5 year intervals) Only about five new antibiotics are in the drugpipeline, out of more than506 agents in development. 16Medical Need Versus Market Realities There is a growing disconnect between the medical need perceived by those who practice infectious diseasesmedicine and the market as assessed by thepharmaceutical industry. Infectious diseases physicians seea significant need for new antibiotics to treat a growingnumber of bacterial infections from which their patientssuffer\u2014but antibiotic R&D does not add up from abusiness perspective. The costs outweigh the benefits to acompany's bottom line.The pharmaceutical industry, like all other publicly traded industries, must deliver for its shareholders in order tojustify their continued investment. The unique nature ofantibiotics makes securing investments challenging.Because antibiotics work so well and so fast, they producea weak return on investment for manufacturers.Antibiotics are commonly prescribed for seven to 14 days.Even for the most serious of infections, these drugs arerarely needed for more than four to six weeks. Understandably, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and their investors are drawn to developproducts that provide greater returns on investments. Thefavored drugs include those that patients take for life, likeinsulin for diabetes, statins for elevated cholesterol, anddrugs that treat hypertension and arthritis. Although thesedrugs do address significant medical needs, other drugs\u2014like those used to treat impotence, baldness, and otherlifestyle issues\u2014have little to no medical benefit at all butare likely to reap huge profits. Experts in industry, government, and academia understand the problem and have acknowledged it for years: \"Product development in areas crucial to public health goals, such as antibiotics, has slowed significantlyduring the past decade.\" (U.S. Food and DrugAdministration. Innovation/Stagnation: Challenge and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New MedicalProducts. March 2004.) \"To describe drug research in trendy terms: chronic disease medications are in; anti-infectives are out.\"When it comes to annual sales potential, antibioticsdon't measure up. An industry representative speakingat a scientific conference noted that a musculoskeletaldrug is worth about $1.150 billion, a neurosciencetreatment is rated at $720 million, and a medicine forresistant Gram-positive cocci is $100million. (Sellers, LJ. Big pharma bails on anti-infectivesresearch. Pharmaceutical Executive. December 2003, 22.) Are Small Biotechnology Companies Engaged? If major pharmaceutical companies are exiting the field,what about smallerbiopharmaceutical companies? Indeed, several smaller companies are focusing onthe development of antibiotic compounds (e.g.,Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Basilea, Paratek, VicuronPharmaceuticals, Oscient). However, asubstantial number of other small companies simplyare pursuing development of drugs that have beenlicensed from the major companies\u2014i.e., most arenot involved in basic discovery research. While somesmaller companies are funding antibiotic discoveryprograms, it remains to be seen whether they can besuccessful in the absence of the financial supportand expertise available at larger companies. In orderto advance new classes of antibiotics from discoveryto development, they may need the financialsupport of larger companies or other backers to fundlate-stage clinical trials and commercialization. Forthe economic reasons described in this paper, it isnot apparent that such support will be forthcoming. 17 \"As a consumer, you want a drug [that] you don't have to take very long and works very well. But thatisn't the most profitable type of drug. ... [I]n somecases the economics and the public health match up.\" (Mark Goldberger, acting deputydirector of FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation andResearch, quoted in Service, RF. Orphan drugs of thefuture? Science. March 19, 2004, Vol. 303, 1798.) U.S. demographics shifting toward an increasingly older population will lure even more investors andcompanies to the chronic diseases market. As genericscompete with existing products, companies faceadditional pressure to develop new blockbusters,which account for most of their revenue. (Health CareIndustry Market Update: Pharmaceuticals, Centers forMedicare and Medicaid Service. January 10, 2003.) Limiting Resistance\u2014and Profitability, Too Antibiotic resistance\u2014and public health measures to combat resistance\u2014also pose unique challenges tosecuring investment in antibiotic R&D. Resistance limitsthe effectiveness of antibiotics over time and thereforedecreases a drug's long-term profitability. Antibioticsand other antimicrobials are the only drugs whereextensive use leads to loss of benefit. In addition, infectious diseases physicians and other public health experts often hold new antibiotics inreserve, hoping to avoid fostering the rapid emergenceof resistant bacteria and saving them for when they aremost needed. This unusual practice is unique to anti-infective drugs. From a public health perspective, thestrategy is sensible. However, in pharmaceutical industryterms, this practice translates into a \"slow commercialuptake\" that limits the potential market for newantibiotics. Drug company representatives have said thatphysicians' efforts to preserve antibiotics for thetreatment of resistant infections serve as a disincentiveto antibiotic discovery and development. Technical Hur dles In addition to the lack of effective market incentives, antibiotic R&D is hampered by technical challenges as well.As IOM's microbial threats report noted, \"the discovery ofnew antibiotics is not as easy as was once believed.\" Until the early 1990s, pharmaceutical companies tended to develop new infectious diseases drugs by randomlyscreening natural products to identify those demonstratingantimicrobial activity. New technologies in use since then,such as combinational chemistry, X-ray crystallography,high throughput screening, and molecular modeling, havenot been as successful in identifying new antibiotics asmight have been hoped. Infectious disease doctors often hold new antibiotics in reserve because of concerns about resistance.August 2003. A 7-year-old Texas boy came down with a fever of nearly 103 degrees andcomplained of severe pain in his leg. He wastaken to Hermann Children's Hospital inHouston, where doctors discovered that avirulent, drug-resistant staph infection wascausing a potentially fatal blood clot in theboy's leg. Fortunately, in this case, surgerywas life-saving. 18Moreover, industry representatives speaking about these challenges at a recent scientific meeting said that genomicdata have \"failed to deliver the expected flood of noveltargets.\" Assuming one has a novel target of action within the bacterium, there is still the challenge of finding a chemicalentity that can reach the target site and inhibit growth,without being too highly toxic to patients. \"The technicalhurdles, coupled with competition for resources withinpharmaceutical companies from other significant medicalneeds with larger market opportunities, have led toreduced investment in or, in the case of most companies,elimination of antibiotic drug discovery programs,\"concluded IOM. Additional Hurdles for Clinical Trials of New Antibiotics In addition to market and technical challenges, industry representatives cite scientific and regulatory hurdles asimpediments to antibiotic approvals. Because antibiotics are used to treat various types of infection (e.g., pneumonia, urinary tract infection, skin andsoft tissue infection), the drug approval process requiresclinical trials for each of these indications (one trial or oftenmore per indication), with enrollment of large numbers ofpatients to ensure an understanding of a drug's safety andeffectiveness against specific bacterial pathogens. Finding enough patients to enroll in clinical trials of new drugs to treat resistant pathogens is no easy task. Bycontrast, when enrolling patients in a clinical trial to test anew cancer drug, researchers know from the start whethera specific patient has the specific type of cancer they aretargeting. With antibiotic clinical trials, that is notnecessarily the case. For many resistant pathogens, thereare no rapid diagnostic tests available to help researchersto identify patients who would be eligible for their studies. As one industry consultant explained, in order to test a drug that is intended to treat resistant strains, \"You haveto wait for epidemics to break out in hospital wards, andyou can't predict when that will happen. It may take fiveyears to complete a clinical study.\" One company's experience in trying to develop a new drug to treat vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) illustratessome of the challenges. Researchers used entry criteriathat were developed in consensus with FDA and academia.With 54 research sites open for two years, only threepatients enrolled in the study\u2014it was closed for insufficientenrollment. When a second study was launched, only 45subjects enrolled over a period of 18 months. This doesnot mean that there are few VRE infections; indeed,according to CDC, there are estimated to be 26,000hospital-acquired cases each year in the United States. (SeeTable 1.) The problem is in the ability to anticipate theirpresence and to enroll critically ill patients in clinical trials. July 2001. An 11-year-old boystruck by aresistant staphinfection first spent seven weeks in thehospital, two of those weeks in intensive care,and then underwent 12 surgeries over thenext two years to excise the infection andrepair the damage it inflicted on his thighbone. After two years of operations, bodycasts, wheelchairs, and crutches, this boy isfinally able to walk and run again, althoughwith a limp because his previously infectedleg is now shorter than the other. 19 Updated FDA guidance documents defining the investigational approaches for each type of infection, someof which are currently in review, will bring needed clarityto drug development teams within industry. Such guidancewould provide a better understanding about the type ofsafety and efficacy data that FDA could find to bescientifically compelling and acceptable when evaluatingnew antibiotic applications. Lengthy, Costly, and Risky Process As with any other drug, antibiotic R&D is a lengthy, costly, and risky process. According to a September 2003 review by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, the mediantime from the beginning of clinical testing through FDAreview for new antibiotics and similar drugs was just oversix years (55.8 months in the clinical phase; 18.6 months inthe review phase).* Preclinical identification and testing ofpotential candidate drugs may add several more years tothe process. During the pre-approval phases of drug discovery and development, a product's patent clock is ticking away.Most patents are filed during the pre-clinical phase, whichmeans that the effective patent life of a new compoundonce it is brought to market is less (sometimes substantiallyso) than the 20 years provided by law. Although currentlaw allows for restoration of some patent time lost duringFDA's period of review, not all lost time is restored. The 2003 IOM report acknowledged this challenge, noting that \"the development of an antibiotic is an expensive andrisky process; no guarantee can be made that theantibiotic will remain effective and the investment will beregained before the patent period has ended.\" As for thecost, according to a recent FDA report, bringing a newdrug to market can cost $800 million to $1.7 billion. The pharmaceutical industry's risks are high. According to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers ofAmerica, only five in 5,000 compounds that enterpreclinical testing make it to human testing, and only oneof these five is approved. If a product is not going toproduce strong profits, then other products with greatermarket potential will get the \"green light\" for the nextphase of development. *The study looked at small molecule anti-infectives approved between 1982 and 2001.Pharmaceutical Charity Helps, But Is Not the Solution The pharmaceutical industry participates in many areas of public health and providesmany good works pro bono . Some examples include Merck & Co.'s efforts related to RiverBlindness; efforts by Bristol-Myers Squibb,Pfizer, and AstraZeneca's TB drug discoveryinitiatives. cannot alterits fundamental business strategy in any waythat would place its bottom line at risk.Policymakers and the public should have noillusions that future pharmaceutical charitywill be sufficient to address the existing and emerging pathogens that threaten public health. Because antibiotics work so well and so fast, they producea weak return on investmentfor manufacturers. 20Much has been written about antibiotic resistance and the decline in R&D. Many groups have supportedstrengthening the U.S. and international governments'response to this growing public health crisis, includingIOM, the World Health Organization, the CongressionalOffice of Technology Assessment, the American Society forMicrobiology, and the Alliance for the Prudent Use ofAntibiotics. To date, the U.S. government's action has been inadequate to address the brewing crisis, but theAdministration and Congress recently have announcedseveral proposals, which, if successfully and fullyimplemented, could make a difference. NIH's Roadmap for Medical Research NIH's Roadmap , issued in September 2003, outlines a series of initiatives to \"speed the movement of researchdiscoveries from the bench to the bedside.\" Afterdecades of investment in basic biomedical research, the Roadmap is intended to widen NIH's mission to include translational research \u2014i.e., translating basic discoveries from concept into clinical evaluation, focusing onspecific diseases or therapies. FDA's Innovation/Stagnation: Challenge and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New Medical Products In March 2004, FDA issued its Critical Path report to complement the NIH Roadmap initiative. In FDA's view \"applied sciences have not kept pace with thetremendous advances in basic sciences.\" The Critical Path plan is FDA's attempt to encourage the creation of new tools to get fundamentally better answers abouthow the safety and effectiveness of new drugs can bedemonstrated, in faster time frames, with morecertainty, and at lower costs. FDA's report has beencalled \"timely and significant\" and \"courageous\" byTHEFEDERAL GOVERNMENT 'SRESPONSE National Security and Antibiotic R esistance Antibiotic resistance not only threatens public health, but may have national and global security implications as well. Virtually all of the antibiotic-resistant pathogens that exist naturally today can be bio-engineered through forced mutation or cloning. In addition, genetic manipulation of existing pathogenscould render them resistant to currently available antibiotics. A better understanding of the mechanismsrelated to drug resistance and tools that could be derived from such research may help U.S. public healthofficials as they monitor and respond to any future bioterrorism episodes that involve geneticallyengineered resistant pathogens. Moreover, antibiotic resistance may limit the effectiveness of antibioticsduring future bioterrorism events, outbreaks, and other emergencies. Members of Congress are beginning to see the connection and to understand our vulnerability. In their reports on Project Bioshield in 2003, both the House Government Reform Committee and the Energy andCommerce Committee linked natural conditions , including antimicrobial resistance and dangerous viruses, to national security concerns. The Energy and Commerce Report stated \"advancing the discovery of newantimicrobial drugs to treat resistant organisms ... may well pay dividends for both national security andpublic health.\" [See also the report, Beyond Anthrax: Confronting the Biological Weapons Threat , issued May 4, 2004, by the Democrats of the House Select Committee on Homeland Security simultaneously with the introductionof the Rapid Pathogen Identification to Delivery of Cures Act (H.R. 4258).] 21 industry leaders who have praised the report for \"recognizing the serious problems that are preventingnew, innovative drugs and biologics from getting to thepatients who need them.\" Project Bioshield Following the 2001 anthrax attacks, the Administration and congressional leaders moved rapidly to introducethe Project Bioshield Act.* The legislation is intended tospur R&D of new drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics foruse against potential bioterrorism agents by establishinga guaranteed market for these products with the federalgovernment serving as purchaser. Project Bioshieldfocuses on the six category A bioterrorism agents ofgreatest concern (smallpox, anthrax, botulism, tularemia,viral hemorrhagic fevers, and plague). The legislation does not include incentives to spur R&D of new antibiotics to treat drug-resistant infections thatthreaten public health, despite IDSA's pleas that they beincluded. Public Health Service Action Plan to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance In January 2001, a federal interagency task force including CDC, FDA, NIH, and other agencies publishedthe Public Health Service Action Plan to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance. The action plan is a comprehensive strategy that includes efforts to reversethe stagnation in antibiotic R&D. Other key action itemstarget antimicrobial resistance surveillance, preventionand control, and research. Due to limitedappropriations, the Administration's implementation ofthe plan thus far has been slow, not well coordinated,and incomplete. General Accounting Office Study In May 2003, Senators Judd Gregg (R-NH) and Jack Reed (D-RI) asked the General Accounting Office (GAO)to study the antimicrobial availability problem. Thesenators stated: \"With the threat of bioterrorism, the growing number of microorganisms resistant to drug therapy, thereemergence of previously deadly infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, and the emergence of new infectious diseases in the United States, such as severeacute respiratory syndrome and West Nile virus, there isan urgent need for new antimicrobials.\" A year later, GAO has yet to begin the study, and their analysis of the many challenges to antibiotic R&D may be years away. ... The time for studying the problem is over. January 1999. A 13- year-old girl fromrural Minnesota wasbrought to a local hospital with fever and respiratorydistress. She was coughing up blood. A chest X-rayrevealed fluid in the lungs. The girl was treated withthe antibiotics ceftriaxone and nafcillin. Within fivehours of arriving at the hospital, the girl's bloodpressure dropped, and she was transferred to apediatric hospital, intubated, and treated withvancomycin and cefotaxime. Despite intensivemedical care, the girl's health deteriorated, and shedied on the seventh hospital day from multiple organfailures and excessive fluid and swelling in the brain.An autopsy and tests revealed that MRSA haddestroyed her left lung. The girl had no chronicmedical conditions and no recent hospitalizations. *Although not enacted at the time this paper went to press, the Act likely will have been enacted by its publication date. 22 The federal government must take decisive action now. Primarily, policymakers must focus on adopting incentivesto stimulate investment in this area of discovery bypharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Anyantibiotic R&D plan that does not include industry action atits core will yield hollow promises. Government-sponsoredresearch and refinement of existing regulations, policies,and guidance can help to address the overall problem ofantibiotic resistance, fill in some of the gaps in research,and reduce the cost of antibiotic discovery anddevelopment. But industry must take the lead to ensuresuccess. Industry decision-making is not perfect from apublic health perspective, but the focus on financialincentives has made industry successful in the past, andnew incentives can lead to future successes. The past two decades of antibiotic development clearly have demonstrated that we no longer can rely on existingmarket forces to keep companies engaged in this area ofdrug discovery and development. Should additionalcompanies' antibiotic R&D infrastructures be dismantled, itwill take years to establish new programs\u2014or thisexpertise could simply be lost forever. Moreover, given the10-year time gap that it takes for new antibiotics to movefrom concept to market, time for action is running out. Creative thinking and innovative policy will solve both the antibiotic R&D and antibiotic resistance problems. IDSA hasexplored with industry, government officials, academics,patient representatives, and congressional staff the long-term value of many potential solutions. Our investigationhas revealed that the incentives most likely to spur R&Dwithin major pharmaceutical companies include those thatprovide financial benefits prior to a drug's approval (e.g.,tax credits for R&D), commence at the time of approval(e.g., wild-card patent extension), reduce the costs ofclinical trials (e.g., FDA flexibility concerning the evidencenecessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy; NationalInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [NIAID]sponsored research to foster the development of rapiddiagnostics tests, etc.); and reduce companies' risks (e.g.,liability protections). R&D at smaller companies also couldbe stimulated through statutory and administrativechanges. Finally, new funding could help to ensure abetter understanding about biological mechanisms relatedto antibiotic resistance, limit the public health impact ofantibiotic resistance, and spur public-private R&D efforts. IDSA does not claim to possess all of the answers, but a combination of the solutions listed in the next section willhelp. Policymakers should use these recommendations toshape a framework for governmental action. INNOVATIVE FEDERAL POLICY AND IMMEDIATE ACTION ARENEEDED Resistant infections can lead to longerhospital stays. April 2004. A 52-year-old Maryland man, previously healthy, was hospitalizedcomplaining of cough, fever, and shortness ofbreath. His sputum culture grew MRSA. Achest X-ray showed pneumonia involvingalmost all segments of the lung. He wastreated aggressively with antibiotics,transferred to the intensive care unit, andplaced on a ventilator but died on the secondhospital day. 23 Legislative action is necessary to stem the tide of pharmaceutical company departures from antibiotic R&D andto stimulate the involvement of non-active companies. Criticalpriorities that will have the greatest impact are indicated. Commission to Prioritize Antimicrobial Discovery To begin to address the \"bad bugs, no drugs\" problem, Congress should establish and empower an independentCommission to Prioritize Antimicrobial Discovery (CPAD).CPAD's specific focus would be to identify the targetedpathogens that are (or are likely to become) a significantthreat to public health due to drug resistance and otherfactors. The statutory R&D incentives that follow wouldapply to drugs that treat these pathogens. CPAD'sdecision-making would be based on an analysis of risks aswell as benefits to public health. An expert independent commission is needed to address the public health and R&D issues unique to antimicrobial R&D.Similar entities in other areas of medicine include the NationalVaccine Advisory Committee and the National CancerAdvisory Board. CPAD would make recommendations directly to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and would be comprisedof experts from the infectious diseases medical and researchcommunities, representatives from relevant governmentagencies (CDC, FDA, NIH), and representatives from industryand relevant patient advocacy groups. Companies would register with HHS to become eligible for the incentives. Once HHS certified a company as eligible, itcould receive tax credits (R&D, capital formation, etc.). Whena company successfully developed a product that met HHSpredetermined specifications, it would become eligible forother incentives (intellectual property, liability, etc.).Proposed Statutory Incentives Congress must enact a robust set of statutory incentives to stimulate private sector investment and innovation. Unlesssuch incentives are established, Americans will be at evengreater risk from infectious disease threats in the future. The Project Bioshield Act and pending legislation, such as the Biological, Chemical, and Radiological WeaponsCountermeasures Research Act (S. 666), introduced bySenators Lieberman and Hatch in 2003, provide good startingpoints for congressional discussions about what incentives areappropriate. Like Project Bioshield, S. 666 includes progressiveideas to spur R&D for bioterrorism countermeasures. S. 666goes further, however, providing tax credits, specialintellectual property incentives, and antitrust andindemnification provisions. Existing law offers other models to consider. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, for example, provides anadditional six months of market exclusivity for new or already-marketed drugs and priority review status for pediatricsupplements to a drug application, if the holder of anapproved application undertakes studies of these drugs inchildren. Under the Orphan Drug Act,* qualifying drugsreceive seven years of market exclusivity protection againstgenerics and innovator drugs, tax incentives (up to 50 percentfor clinical research), and research grants. Following is a list of potential statutory incentives for Congress to consider: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONGRESS *Orphan diseases or conditions must affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or provide no reasonable expectationthat the sales of the drug will recover the costs of development.CRITICAL PRIORITY 24 1. Supplemental intellectual property protections for companies that invest in R&D for priority antibiotics Establishment of a \"wild-card patent extension\" linked to R&D for antibiotics totreat targeted pathogens The original concept of a wild-card patent extension is provided in S. 666. Under this proposal, a company thatreceives approval for a new antibiotic, or a new indicationfor an existing antibiotic, that treats a targeted pathogenwould be permitted to extend the market exclusivity periodfor another of the company's FDA-approved drugs. S. 666supports a patent extension of two years. The wild-card incentive may not be acceptable to all policymakers. For that reason, Congress should explore thefeasibility of modifying the wild-card concept to requirethat the company commit a substantive portion (10percent-20 percent) of the profits derived from the patentextension to additional targeted antibiotic R&D. Thisincentive is unlikely to help small biopharmaceuticalcompanies, but would be a significant lure to majorpharmaceutical firms. Restoration of all patent time lost during FDA's review of applications for antibiotics that treattargeted pathogens FDA's review time for new antibiotic applications can vary, but the mean time is as long as 18 months. Although someof the patent time lost during FDA's review may berestored under current law, the specter of losing any patenttime can have dramatic implications for companies'decision-making. S.666 permits a company to select eitherthis incentive or the wild-card patent extension incentive,but not both. Because the profit potential of mostantibiotics is not very high and is likely to decline as thepatent runs out, this is unlikely to be a very strong incentivein most cases. Extension of market exclusivity for antibiotics that treat targeted pathogens similar to what has been successfully implemented for pediatric andorphan drugs Extended periods of market exclusivity can be an incentive to the original sponsor of a drug, as generic copies of the drug may not be approved or marketed during this time. Lengths of market exclusivity used or proposed in the pastinclude six months under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), seven years under the Orphan Drug Act, and 10 years under S. 666. Several pharmaceuticalcompanies have indicated that an additional six months ofmarket exclusivity would not provide a sufficient draw forthem to invest in the development of new antibiotics or toseek a new indication for an existing antibiotic. For thatreason, new legislation should include the longer periods ofexclusivity as available under the Orphan Drug Act or asproposed in S. 666. The fundamental principle behind the passage of BPCA and the Orphan Drug Act is that the government has a publichealth interest in spurring the discovery of new treatmentsto assist vulnerable populations. This same principle shouldprompt Congress to address the problem of drug-resistantinfections. Because the profit potential of most antibiotics is not high and is likely to decline over time, this profit is unlikely to bea very strong incentive in most cases. 2. Other potential statutory incentives to spur antibiotic R&D Provide tax incentives (as provided in S. 666). The company seeking to fund research would be eligible toelect among the following tax incentives: - Claim tax credits for R&D of antibiotics that treat targeted pathogens CRITICAL PRIORITYRECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONGRESS (CONTINUED ) CRITICAL PRIORITY 25 - Allow R&D limited partnerships to conduct research on drugs to treat targeted pathogens. The partnerships would pass through all business deductions and credits tothe partners. - Issue a special class of stock for the entity to conduct the research. The investors would be entitled to a zero capital gains tax rate on any gains realized on the stock. - Receive a special tax credit for research conducted at a non-profit and academic research institution Provide FDA with additional statutory flexibility to approve antibiotics that treat targeted pathogens asopposed to types of infection (e.g., resistant S. aureus vs. pneumonia) and encourage the agency to use that authority Create a guaranteed market with the federal government as purchaser and sufficientappropriations to stimulate R&D for antibiotics thattreat targeted pathogens (as provided for biodefense in Project Bioshield and S. 666) The \"bad bugs, no drugs\" problem highlights the need for an open and flowing pipeline of antibiotics to treat patientson a daily basis in hospitals and communities across theUnited States. A guaranteed market that promptsstockpiling of drugs is unlikely to have much applicability inthis regard. 3.Establish similar statutory incentives (as listed previously) to spur R&D forrapid diagnostic tests to identify targeted pathogens, which will help to reduce the cost of clinical trials Policymakers should consider applying the incentives outlined above as potential solutions to encourage R&D for rapiddiagnostic tests. New rapid diagnostics would greatly reducethe cost and time needed to conduct clinical trials for newantibiotics. For many resistant pathogens, there currently areno rapid diagnostic tests available to assist in identifying eligible patients for clinical trials. Cutting costs and time willserve as incentives for greater investment in and more speedyapproval of targeted antibiotics. In addition, new rapiddiagnostics will permit physicians to diagnose specificbacterial infections in their patients. This will enablephysicians to prescribe the most appropriate antibiotics,which will slow the evolution of new resistance. 4. Potential statutory incentives of interest to small biopharmaceutical companies that have far less up-frontcapital to invest in R&D for antibiotics that treat targeted pathogens Provide tax incentives to form capital from investors and retained earnings for biopharmaceuticalcompanies that cannot use tax credits, because theyhave no tax liability, or permit the small company tosave or sell its credits (as provided in S. 666) Significantly increase the number and amount of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants thatNIH can provide for these antibiotics Waive user fees for supplemental new drug applications submitted to FDA for the treatment of targeted pathogens Currently, companies can submit supplemental applications for new indications of drugs that havealready been approved by FDA\u2014for example, if anexisting drug is found to be effective in treating adifferent bacterial infection or the same infection locatedin a different area of the body. Under current law, theuser fee is waived for the original new drug applicationthat an eligible \"small company\" submits to FDA forreview. However, the company is charged a user fee forsupplemental applications submitted for each newindication even if the new indication will treat anorganism that threatens public health.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONGRESS (CONTINUED ) 26 5. Liability protections afforded to companies that receive FDA approval for antibiotics that treat targeted pathogens (asprovided in S. 666) For obvious reasons, the pharmaceutical company representatives with whom IDSA met each saw governmentindemnification, similar to what has been affordedchildhood vaccines, as a powerful incentive to develop newantibiotics. IDSA's recommendation is limited to antibioticsas they are being used to treat pathogens targeted by theCommission to Promote Antimicrobial Discovery. 6. Limited antitrust exemptions for companies that seek to worktogether to expedite research on targeted antibiotics (as provided in S. 666) Congress must act now to encourage pharmaceutical and biotech companies to invest in the antibiotics market.February 2004. A 34-year-old Maryland woman had the flu and went to an emergency roomwhere a chest X-ray showed pneumonia.Laboratory studies confirmed it was due toMRSA. She developed shock and required aventilator and tracheostomy to supportbreathing. As a complication of shock, both legs were amputated. She remained in the hospital for more than two months. CRITICAL PRIORITYRECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONGRESS (CONTINUED ) Next Steps for Congress Hearings should be scheduled as soon as possible to highlight the human consequences of the \"bad bugs, no drugs\"problem and to determine which combination of incentives aremost appropriate. The Senate and House leadership shouldwork together in a bipartisan manner to enact sufficientstatutory incentives to stimulate new antibiotic R&D. Congressshould work cooperatively with the Administration toencourage greater antibiotic R&D and to limit the public healthimpact of antibiotic resistance. 27 The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) high standards for evaluating antibiotics' safety and efficacy must be maintained.However, avenues must be explored to better address theunique nature of antibiotic discovery and stimulate industry-sponsored antibiotic R&D. As FDA implements its new Critical Path plan, the agency should implement the following recommendations. Each of the recommendations should beconsidered a critical priority: Publish updated guidelines for clinical trials of anti- infectives. Industry is understandably hesitant to initiate new clinical trials in areas where the standards for safetyand efficacy are unclear. FDA should issue, as soon aspossible, guidelines for resistant pathogens, bacterialmeningitis, acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial otitismedia, and acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Theseguidelines have been in revision or development for sometime. FDA also should move quickly to identify additionalareas of uncertainty in antibiotic drug development anddevelop or update guidelines in those areas as well. Reviewof these guidance documents at appropriate intervals alsowould be extremely useful in ensuring their continuedrelevance and accuracy. Encourage imaginative clinical trial designs that lead to a better understanding of drug efficacy againstresistant pathogens. For example, clinical trial data on resistant pathogens are time-consuming and costly toaccrue. FDA could define ways in which an antibiotic'sefficacy against drug-sensitive types of bacteria could beused to extrapolate efficacy against drug-resistant strains. Provide a clear definition of acceptable surrogate markers as endpoints for clinical trials of bacterialinfections. In other words, FDA needs to define new ways to determine an antibiotic's effectiveness, such as clearingbacteria from blood or other body sites (e.g., hip and kneeimplants) or resolving fever. This concept has been acceptedfor antiviral agents, but has had limited application tobacterial infections. Explore, and when appropriate encourage, the use of animal models of infection, in vitro technologies (e.g., test tube), and valid microbiologic surrogate markers(e.g., clearance of bacteremia) to reduce the numberof efficacy studies required for each additionalindication. These data are easier and less costly to obtain than full results of safety and efficacy testing in human subjects, and therefore, when appropriate, could result in a more timely and efficient approval process. Of course, safeand effective drug dose regimens must be maintained. Explore with NIAID all opportunities to streamline antibiotic drug development. (See examples outlined under NIAID recommendations.) Grant accelerated approval status for antibiotics that treat targeted pathogens. This regulatory pathway allows FDA to grant approval prior to completion of full humantesting, based upon a demonstration of efficacy usingsurrogate endpoints with a commitment for post-approvalhuman testing to confirm the effect on disease outcomes.Moving beyond the current scenario, FDA could giveprovisional approval for antibiotics that treat targetedpathogens followed by a post-approval study of the drugby a select group of investigators certified to treat patientswith the drug. The certified investigators would collectadditional efficacy data needed to lead to a full approval,while providing patients with earlier access to the drug.Health care payers would offset the costs of the clinicaltrials, which may prompt companies to pursue candidatedrugs that they otherwise might not.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FDA CRITICAL PRIORITIES 28 NIH has shown leadership in developing the Roadmap initiative. The true test is still to come as the plan is implemented. The National Institute of Allergy and InfectiousDiseases (NIAID) has primary responsibility for implementingthe Roadmap in the infectious diseases arena. To achieve success, NIAID should implement the following recommendations. Each of these recommendations should be considered a critical priority: Move aggressively to expand the translational (bench to bedside) research concepts contained in the Roadmap to strengthen antibiotic R&D, remove roadblocks that may exist in NIAID's structure andguidelines, and accelerate antibiotic resistanceresearch activities Increase the number and size of grants to small businesses, academic institutions, and non-profitorganizations that focus on R&D of antibiotics to treattargeted pathogens Seek greater opportunities to work with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies toadvance antibiotic R&D, and ensure that NIAID staffwho oversee technology-transfer efforts understandindustry's motivations and goals Engage more aggressively the infectious diseases research community in research planning efforts and create a more transparent decision-making process Sufficiently fund and rapidly implement NIAID's newly launched Drug Discovery and Mechanisms ofAntimicrobial Resistance Study Section Encourage research on topics directly related to the implementation of clinical trials (e.g., surrogate endpoints of response to therapy, animal models, andanalytical methods) Sponsor research into new rapid diagnostic tests for bacterial infections that, when available, could reducethe cost of clinical trials Re-examine NIH's 1999 research tool guidelines and modify or waive the guidelines where necessary. NIH's guidelines have been criticized for unnecessarily restricting companies' intellectual property rights andrevenue generation where research tools have beendeveloped in conjunction with federally funded research.Critics believe the guidelines should be modified to breathe new life into research tool development, particularly to help fight emerging infectious pathogens. Research toolsinclude cell lines, drug delivery technologies, laboratory animals, clones and cloning tools, databases, and other technologies. Develop a fellowship curriculum designed for clinician investigators to provide expertise in clinical trials ofnew antibiotics. FDA and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) announced an analogous program for anti-cancerdrugs in 2003. Explore joint programs with FDA to streamline antibiotic drug development similar to programsinitiated by NCI and FDA in 2003. The NCI/FDA programs are intended to inform and harmonize all phasesof cancer drug discovery, development, and regulatoryreview. Encourage research on antibiotic use patterns and their impact on resistance, specifically the impact of use restrictions on newly approved antibiotics Fund placebo controlled trials to determine if certain diseases require antibiotic therapy (e.g., acute otitis media, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, andacute bacteria sinusitis). There is reasonable concern that antibiotics frequently are prescribed to treat diseases thatare not caused by bacteria (e.g., are viral in origin). Thisinappropriate use of antibiotics promotes antibioticresistance with no benefit to patients. Definitive placebo-controlled studies are needed to elucidate this point.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NIAID CRITICAL PRIORITIES 29 NEWFUNDING NEEDED Public and private efforts that target the growing problem of drug resistance and lack of antibiotic R&D are drasticallyunder-funded. An infusion of new resources (i.e., not shiftingfunds from other public health efforts) in several criticalprogram areas will go a long way toward assuring Americansthat they will soon be protected from dangerous and drug-resistant pathogens. Double CDC's antimicrobial resistance program to $50 million in 2005 and continue to increase it by $25 million increments until 2009 to a total of $150 million CDC is the primary coordinator of much of the Public Health Service Action Plan to Combat AntimicrobialResistance . Increasing CDC's funding will enable the agency to expand its surveillance of clinical and prescribing datathat are associated with drug-resistant infections, whichwould assist the Commission to Prioritize AntimicrobialDiscovery (referenced above), CDC, and other public healthagencies in setting priorities. Funding also is needed toeducate physicians and parents about the need to protectthe long-term effectiveness of antibiotics as well as tostrengthen infection control activities across the UnitedStates. Finally, broadening the number of CDC's extramuralgrants targeting applied research at academic-based centerswould harness the brainpower of our nation's researchersand assist the agency in developing practical and successfulantimicrobial resistance prevention and control strategies. Increase by $25 million funding for FDA's programs that support antibiotic development and reduce the costs of clinical trials New funding will enable the anti-infective review group within FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Review tobegin to implement the Critical Path plan, including funding research efforts envisioned under the plan and creatingguidelines that clarify for industry the standards FDA willapply to antibiotic R&D. New funding also wouldstrengthen the anti-infective review group's ability toevaluate antibiotics for the treatment of targeted pathogens, by permitting them to contract with companiesthat provide national, real-time microbiological data relatedto relevant antibiotics and all clinically relevant strains ofbacteria. This information is not available throughgovernment sources. New funding also would enhance theCenter for Devices and Radiological Health's ability tosupport the review of rapid diagnostics to detect resistantmicroorganisms. Significantly increase NIAID's critical translational and antibiotic resistance research efforts IDSA and other organizations have called for a 10 percent across-the-board funding increase for NIH in 2005. Suchfunding is necessary to allow NIAID to move aggressively toimplement the Roadmap initiative in the area of antibiotic R&D as well as to support research that will lead to a betterunderstanding ofmechanisms related toantibiotic resistance. February 1999. A 12- month-old fromrural North Dakota wasadmitted to a hospitalwith vomiting,dehydration, andinflammation of hisairway. He had atemperature of slightly more than 105 degrees.Tests and X-rays revealed an infection in his rightlung. Doctors transferred the boy to the intensive-care unit, inserted a chest tube, and treated himwith the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime.The next day the boy developed severe respiratorydistress and falling blood pressure, and he died.The boy had not been hospitalized since birth andhad no known medical problems. However, his 2-year-old sister had been treated for a culture-confirmed MRSA infection three weeks earlier. 30 Support Synergistic Public/Private Solutions A growing number of international public-private partnerships are focusing on the discovery of medicines totreat infectious diseases in the United States and globally.Initiatives like the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative(formed in 1996), the Medicines for Malaria Venture (1999), and the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (2000) offer promising opportunities to advance productR&D in areas that have languished in the past. Public- private partnerships have adopted business models that exploit the venture capital approach to investment in newproduct R&D. Such initiatives receive the bulk of fundingfrom the public and philanthropic sectors. They involve for-profit partners by seeking in-kind contributions fromindustry. The commitment of U.S. public dollars for theseand similar initiatives would take advantage of the entrepreneurial spirit possessed by many researchers and humanitarians. In addition to funding public-private partnerships, policymakers should seriously consider ways to promptcompanies to inventory their shelves for promising drugcandidates that could be donated to the partnerships fordevelopment. Such candidates exist, and companiesrecently have shown some interest in donating them. This is not a current priority for companies, however, becausethe resources required would have to be diverted fromother efforts. Emer ging and R e-Emerging Infections Robust research and development programs are needed to respond successfully to existing infectiousdiseases as well as new threats on the horizon. More than three dozen new infectious diseases have been identified since the 1970s that have impacted the United States and more vulnerable countries. The list includes HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratorysyndrome (SARS), Lyme disease, hepatitis C, a new form of cholera, waterborne disease due to Cryptosporidium , foodborne disease caused by E. coli 0157:H7, and a plethora of neglected diseases that primarily affect patients in the developing world. Some of these diseases have no treatment except for supportive care. For diseases that do have effective treatments, complacency can stifle new research and allow us to be caught off guard when currenttreatments become less effective due to resistance. This has been the case with tuberculosis (TB). It hasbeen 30 years since a new class of antibiotic was approved to treat TB despite the fact that it is thesecond most common microbial cause of death in the world. Doctors also are concerned about the rapidrate at which other bacterial infections, such as gonorrhea and syphilis, are becoming resistant to drugs.Finally, for diseases such as TB, AIDS, and malaria, which have notoriously complex and sometimes toxictreatment regimens, there is a substantial need for new drugs that are not only more effective but easierto deliver to the patient so that greater drug adherence and, ultimately, successful care and treatmentwill be achieved. NEWFUNDING NEEDED (CONTINUED ) 31 The time for talk has passed\u2014it's time to act. The \"bad bugs, no drugs\" problem is growing more severe, andpatients are suffering. Government-sponsored researchand refinement of existing regulations, policies, andguidance can help to address the overall problem ofantibiotic resistance, fill in some of the gaps in drugdevelopment, and help reduce the cost of drug discoveryand development. However, industry action must remainpolicymakers' central focus. Incentives that encouragepharmaceutical companies to remain active in this area ofdiscovery or stimulate additional investment by inactivepharmaceutical and biotechnology companies must be acritical part of any solution. New drugs are desperately needed to treat serious as well as common infections (e.g., blood, heart, and urinary tractinfections; pneumonia; childhood middle-ear infections;boils; food poisoning; gonorrhea; etc.). Thebacteria that cause these infections are becomingincreasingly resistant to the antibiotics that for years havebeen considered standard of care, and the list of resistantpathogens keeps growing. It is not possible to predictwhen an epidemic of drug-resistant bacteria will occur\u2014but we do know it will happen. Congress and the Administration have a window of opportunity to act now\u2014 before a catastrophe occurs \u2014to spur both R&D of antibiotics to treat dangerous and drug-resistant infections and to promote a better understandingof antibiotic resistance and its implications for both publichealth and national and global security. Time is runningout. Even if all of the incentives outlined in this paper were implemented today, it likely would take 10 or moreyears for companies to move safe and effective new drugsto market. Federal officials have worked tirelessly over the past few years to help improve U.S. defenses against, andtreatments for, bioterrorism agents. Although this work isneeded and appropriate, it also is necessary to keep risks inperspective. Drug-resistant bacterial infections kill tens ofthousands of Americans every year and a growing numberof individuals are succumbing to community-acquiredinfections. An epidemic may harm millions. UnlessCongress and the Administration move with urgency toaddress these infections now, there is a very good chancethat U.S. patients will suffer greatly in the future.CONCLUSION January 1998. A 16-month-old girl from rural North Dakota was taken to a local hospitalwith a temperature of over 105 degrees. Shewas suffering from seizures and was in shock.Doctors treated her with the antibioticceftriaxone, but the girl died within twohours of heart and lung failure. An autopsyand tests revealed that MRSA had spread toher brain, heart, liver, and kidneys. Onemonth earlier, the patient had been treatedwith amoxicillin for otitis media (an earinfection). Neither the girl nor her familymembers had been hospitalized during theprevious year. Drug-resistant infections are more difficult to treat. 32Antibiotic-resistant infections increasingly common among healthy people [press release].
