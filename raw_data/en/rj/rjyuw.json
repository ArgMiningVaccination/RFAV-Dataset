If you combine natural remedies with traditional forms of treatment, they might help you manage moderate symptoms. Why Use Joint Supplements? Bone and joint health become more crucial as we age. We may be seeking to aid in the healing of an injury. We may be looking for strategies to stay healthy because we're worried about osteoporosis or arthritis. Healthy bones and joints can be maintained with the help of vitamins, minerals, and other dietary [supplements](https://stpaulrheumatology.com/2022/02/blog-6-supplements-to-improve-joint-health/). However, make sure they're a part of a comprehensive plan that incorporates nutrition, exercise, and help from medical professionals. When starting a new supplement, discuss it with your doctor. There are medical factors to take into account, such as drug interactions. What Vitamins and Minerals Are Essential for Bone Health? Many [nutrients ](https://stpaulrheumatology.com/2022/11/the-9-best-bone-and-joint-health-supplements/)required for bone health can be obtained if you consume a healthy diet. However, including supplements in the mix can help us ensure we're covered, particularly as we age. We may choose to take supplements of the following vitamins and minerals for the maintenance of our bones and joints: - OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS It is well-recognized that omega-3 fatty acids can reduce inflammation. They are additionally advantageous for heart health. The secret to controlling pain and regaining function is reducing inflammation. People with rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory condition that produces swelling in the joints, may find omega-3s very beneficial. - CALCIUM For strong and healthy bones, calcium is necessary. We must get calcium from our diets since our bodies cannot naturally make it. Our bodies start removing calcium from the bones when we do not consume enough of it. Osteoporosis may eventually result from this weakening of the bones. Although non-dairy foods also contain calcium, dairy products are the primary source for most people. - VITAMIN D Together with calcium, vitamin D is essential for your body to absorb calcium from meals properly. Sunlight exposure helps our bodies make vitamin D, but it also exposes them to excessive UV radiation, which can cause skin cancer. This is why it's advised to consume meals or supplements that contain vitamin D. - VITAMIN C Vitamin C aids in maintaining healthy joints and lowering the incidence of inflammatory arthritis. Getting the proper dosage\u2014not too much or too little\u2014is the key. Seventy-five milligrams of vitamin C for women and 90 milligrams for men should be consumed daily. - POLYPHENOLS Antioxidants called polyphenols may lessen joint inflammation and delay cartilage deterioration. For rheumatoid arthritis patients who must take immunosuppressive drugs, they may also strengthen bones and aid in the body's ability to fight off infections. - SULFORAPHANE According to studies, sulforaphane may inhibit the enzymes responsible for destroying joint cartilage and lessen inflammation. - DIALLYL DISULFIDE Diallyl disulfide may restrict the enzymes that damage cartilage, according to research. A study found that individuals who consumed these items regularly showed fewer early osteoarthritis symptoms. 7 Natural Join Supplements to Consider Maintaining a balanced diet is crucial even if you don't experience joint discomfort. However, you should include these items in your diet if you do have joint pain brought on by osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis to aid with inflammation and joint health. - TURMERIC Turmeric, a plant from the ginger family, is frequently used in South Asian dishes like curry. Curcumin, a vital component that can aid in reducing inflammation, is present in it. Turmeric must be absorbed with fatty oils, like avocado or olive oil, and black pepper, which most supplements contain, to be effective as a dietary supplement and not only digested and expelled. - BOSWELLIA Boswellia serrata extract has been found in clinical investigations to have anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritis properties, alleviate pain, and restore bodily function. Frankincense or olibanum is the name for the sticky exudate or resin that is obtained by removing the bark. In Ayurveda, Boswellia is frequently used to cure arthritis. - GINGER Many different ginger compounds have been proven to have antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, according to recent in vitro and animal studies. These properties help reduce the symptoms of chronic inflammatory diseases, including pain. Participants who consumed either two grams of heated ginger or two grams of raw ginger reported less pain and inflammation. Both forms of ginger were shown to be beneficial. However, heat-treated ginger was deemed to have a more substantial effect. - ALOE VERA You can benefit from the natural anti-inflammatory effects of aloe vera by including its juice in your daily regimen. It is packed with antioxidant-rich polyphenols that can help lessen the impact of intermittent inflammation, the sensation of joint stiffness, and joint pain. Inflammation is also reduced when aloe vera is applied topically. You can also immediately apply the gel of the Aloe vera plant to sore and swollen joints. Due to the gel's anti-inflammatory characteristics, it will relieve joint pain and immobility. - GREEN TEA Due to its numerous health advantages, tea is one of the most extraordinary beverages for those with arthritis. Green, black, and white teas are all high in polyphenols, which have anti-inflammatory properties. Due to the presence of the active component \"epigallocatechin-3-gallate,\" or EGCG, in green tea, it is typically believed to be the healthiest beverage. - EUCALYPTUS According to research, eucalyptus oil relieves joint inflammation. This essential oil is used in many well-known over-the-counter lotions and ointments that reduce pain from ailments, including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. With many conditions, eucalyptus oil helps to lessen pain and inflammation. - COLLAGEN It's believed that when you consume more collagen, more protein builds up in the cartilage between your joints. Additionally, it might encourage your body to produce more collagen. Fewer discomfort, less inflammation, and improved mobility are the results. Type II collagen also contains chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine, and hyaluronic acid, all of which reduce joint discomfort and inflammation. The foods on the above list are typically a part of a balanced diet. To maintain a diet supporting bone and joint health, you don't need to look for unusual foods. Additionally, these foods have a lot of other health advantages that make them worthwhile to include in your diet, even if joint pain isn't a recurring problem. "}
