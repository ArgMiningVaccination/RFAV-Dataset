If two doses of different mRNA COVID- 19 vaccine products are administered in these situations (or inadvertently), no additional doses of either product are recommended at this time. Recommendations may be updated as further information becomes available or other vaccine types (e.g., viral vector, protein subunit vaccines) are authorized 9 www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid- 19/info -by-product/clinical -considerations.htmlUS Guidance: Interchangeability of Vaccine for 2ndDose Auto -immune diseases -No data are currently available on the safety and efficacy of mRNA COVID -19 vaccines in persons with autoimmune conditions, though these persons were eligible for enrollment in clinical trials -Persons with autoimmune conditions who have no contraindications to vaccination may receive an mRNA COVID- 19 vaccine. Guillain -Barre -No cases Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) reported w/ mRNA vaccines -Persons with history of GBS may receive mRNA COVID- 19 vaccine unless they have contraindication to vaccination Bells Palsy -Cases of Bell's palsy were reported following vaccination in both clinical trials -However, FDA does not consider these to be above expected frequency expected in general population -Persons with history of Bell's palsy may receive an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine unless they have contraindication to vaccination. 10 www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid- 19/info -by-product/clinical -considerations.htmlUS CDC Updated Guidance: Vaccination in Special ConditionsPost-Vaccine Local Reactions Local reactions not infrequently reported ~1-2D post -vaccination Sx: redness, swelling, hot, mildly painful, itchy Is NOT indicative of infection, does not require abx Tx: ice compresses Can last 7+ days 11 US CDC CISA Clinical Consultation Healthcare providers can request consultation from CISA COVIDvax for a complex COVID- 19 vaccine safety question that is...
