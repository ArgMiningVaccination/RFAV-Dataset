Bausch AA SSUUMMMMAARRYY During production proteins are exposed to various stresses which can cause protein denaturation and inactivation. Th e objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of shear forces which can occu r during filling operations of pharmaceutical solutions with dosing equipment. Such shear forces possibly have a negative influence on shear sensitive substances and may lower the quality and yield of the final drug product. In the scope of this work a peristaltic pum p and different sizes of rotary piston pumps (RPPs) were compared in respect to induced protein aggregation due to shear damage caused by dosing equipm ent. The influence of vari ous parameters such as filling speed, dosing volume, friction surfac e and exposure to air-liquid interfaces and on the intensity of the shear stress was examined. A char acteristic rotary piston pump parameter was developed and introduced as an indicator describing the potential of a rotary piston pump to cause protein damage. Furthermore, excipients were tested on their ability to protec t the model protein against shear-induced damage. 2 model proteins in solution, lactase ( -galactosidase) and rituximab, a recombinant chimeric monoclonal antibody, were used and tested for their suitability as model proteins. No activity loss wa s seen for the sheared lactase solution, therefore finally rituximab was chosen as a model protein. The level of protein aggr egation in the unsheared and sheared solutions was determined by Photon Correlation Spec troscopy (PCS) and SEC-HPLC. TEM was used to visualise protein aggregation. It was found that protein aggr egation was induced by rotary piston pumps however not by the peristaltic pump. The degree of protein damage was marginally low for large rotary piston pumps such as RPP 3 and 4 and showed a co nsiderable increase with smaller sizes like RPP 1 and 2. A loss of protein monomers of 3.2 % \u00b1 1.8% was found after 3 hours of circulation with RPP 1 in the test system. For RPP 2 a loss of 0.4% \u00b1 0.2% was found. No loss was s een for RPP 3. The different clearance between the piston and the cylin der in the different sizes of pumps was suggested to Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 1 Ursula J. Bausch be one reason for the large difference in ex erted shear stress leading to protein aggregation. Two more factors were suggested to have an influence on the exerted stress caused by a RPP, which are the generated friction surface per dosed ml and the dosage volume. Although an influence of the dosage volume could not be confirmed by the conducted shear experiment s. These 3 factors were respected for the calculation of parameter . The evaluation of the filling speed showed minor influence with a trend to fast filling spe eds being more favourable, whereas the exposure to the air-liquid interface did not show an influence. A slight trend was seen that the combination of 5% trehalose dihydrate and 0.5% polyethylene glycol showed the best protective effect out of the excipients examined. An evaluation of the analytical methods used in this work revealed that PCS is an extremely sensitive method to detect prot ein aggregates and wa s therefore very suitable to monitor the changes in the protei n solutions after circ ulation in the test system. A significant lower sensitivity was observed for SEC-HPLC. It can be concluded that for filling of shear s ensitive pharmaceutical protein solutions, it is critical to choose t he appropriate equipment. Large sizes of RPPs such as RPP 3 and 4 or peristaltic pumps should be empl oyed as dosing equipment. Furthermore high speed gives better results than low sp eed, i.e. machine stops during production should be avoided. 2 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch BB IINNTTRROODDUUCCTTIIOONN Peptides and proteins as active pharmace utical ingredients have gained very much in importance in the rec ent years. The introduction of the recombinant DNA technology and the hybridoma technology, has led to the development of a large number of protein pharmac euticals. All leading pha rmaceutical companies do research in this area and seek to register new innovative protein pharmaceuticals like vaccines, monoclonal antibodie s, polyclonal antibodies, enzyme activators and inhibitors, functional regulat ors such as hormones and cyt okines. An overview of recombinant proteins approved in t he European Union till 2004 is given in Table G.1.1 (ISB, 2004) in chapter G. Protein pharmaceuticals have in comparison to structurally small chemical entities a high specificity and activity at relative low concentrations. This is one reason for their importance in the battle against diseases. The activity of a protein is related to the specific three dimensional structures. Any conformational change may lead to denaturation and aggr egation resulting in no or reduc ed activity. During production operations as stirring, pumping, filtration, centrifugation, steriliz ation, shaking and shipping, protein aggregation is routinely found due to t he presence of physical, chemical and thermal stresses. This is a majo r concern as it lowers final yield of the product. Furthermore denatured aggregated prot ein presents a clinical danger when i.v. administered (Demeule et al., 2006). Due to technical advances in analytical sepa ration and purification, biotechnologically manufactured proteins can be obtained at a very high level of purity. However, achieving a stable protein formulation which maintains the integrity of the protein pharmaceutical during manufacturing and dur ing an acceptable shelf-live is still a major challenge in development. Further, optimization of the manufactur ing process and underst anding potential risks during the various production steps can as well contribute to increase final yield. The present study concentrates on examinin g shear forces which may occur during dosing operations with respective equipm ent and to possibly optimize the filling Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 3 Ursula J. Bausch process. Excipients are tested for their suit ability to protect proteins from degradation during the filling process. 4 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch CC TTHHEEOORREETTIICCAALL BBAACCKKGGRROOUUNNDD C.1 Protein Stability C.1.1 Protein Structure Proteins consist of a defined sequence of amino acids, which is referred to as the primary structure. The ami no acid chain folds up to a precisely determined three- dimensional structure. It is the three-dimensional structur e on which the activity of a protein depends. The chain contains lo cal regions of regular structure, -helices, - strands and -turns. The local ordered regions cons titute the secondary structure and are separated by segments of random coil. The whole chain is folded into a three- dimensional tightly packed glo bular structure, the tertiary structure. If a protein consists of more than one amino acid chai n, the defined position of the chains to each other is referred to as t he quaternary struct ure (Doonan, 2002). C.1.2 Protein Folding The formation of secondary structure elements are based on hydrogen bonds. - helices are stabilized by internal hydr ogen bonds. The hydrogen bonding is between amino acids close to each other in the sequence. -strands do generally not occur singly in proteins as they cannot form internal hydrogen bonds. This is why they occur in sheets. Two or more strands are located alongside one another and are stabilized by forming hydrogen bonding netwo rks between the strands. The strands forming the sheet can be located far away from each other in the amino acid sequence. Various forces contribute to the overall foldin g of the protein into t he tertiary structure. The formation of -sheets, which brings together re mote regions of the amino acid chain, but as well each amino acid residue contributes via it 's interactions with other amino acid residues. There are various types of interactions: hydrogen bonds which are formed between the side chains of polar residues or with peptide bonds; ionic interactions formed between amino acids wit h ionized acidic or basic residues; Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 5 Ursula J. Bausch electrostatic interactions formed bet ween the peptide bond which has dipole character and other dipoles or charged resid ues (van der Waals' forces). Individually all of these interactions are relatively weak but the total of t he entire interactions make a large contribution to the shape a nd stability of the protein. The repellent forces between non-polar domains of t he protein and water are responsible for hydrophobic interactions (Wang, 1999). C.1.3 Protein degradation Due to the complex folded three-dimens ional structure, proteins are highly susceptible to degradation (Manning et al., 1989). Degradation is often categorized in two different classes: chemical and physica l. Chemical degradation refers to any process that involves modification of t he molecule via covalent bond formation or cleavage. Resulting is a ne w chemical entity. Physica l degradation involves changes in the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure. Howe ver, chemical and physical degradation do not occur completely i ndependent of one another (Randolph et al., 2002). Chemical degradation can induce furt her physical degradation as for example reduction of disulfide bonds can lead to loss of the protein native conformation and vice versa, e.g. denaturation can cause ox idation to amino acid residues that have been buried inside before (Kendrick et al ., 2002). On the other hand chemical changes may not always have an influence on the protein conformation or activity. It depends on the location of the amino acid (Wang, 1999). C.1.3.1 Chemical degradation Proteins can undergo chemical changes through several pathways like hydrolysis deamidation oxidation beta elimination disulfide exchange racemization 6 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch A large number of possible chemical reactions have been determined as decomposition pathways of polypeptides. Th ey have been summarized in a review article by Manning et al. (1989) . Out of all of the reacti ons, hydrolysis and oxidation reactions are of major concern as a source of chemical instabil ity. Following a brief description of the pathways is given. Hydrolytic cleavage can occur at the peptide bond (RNH-CO-R), known as proteolysis, and more likely at the este r linkage (R-O-CO-R). Peptide bonds are considered to be stable unless hydrolysis is supported by a nei ghbouring group. The amino acids serine, threonine and first of all aspartic acid form peptide bonds which have been identified as the weak link of the chai n. It has been found that the hydrolysis of peptide bonds of aspartic acid in dilute acid is 100 times faster than that of peptide bonds of other amino acids. Part icularly prone to proteolysis is the bond between aspartic acid and proline or glyci ne (Wang, 1999). The hydrolytic rate is mostly influenced by solution pH and temperature; it is increased by extreme pH and high temperature. Often, hydrolysis is a co ntinuation after deamidation of asparagine residues. The nucleophilic addition of water to the side chain ami de of either asparagine or glutamine under removal of ammonia refers to the deamidation reaction. This is a most common degradation reaction in aqueous solution which is catalysed by both acid and base. It has been found t hat in general asparagine is much more labile than glutamine. Asparagine is most stable between pH 2 - 5 in proteins. The deamidation reaction at pH 5 - 12 proceeds rapidly and entirely and passes through a cyclic imide (succinimide) where the side chain carbonyl group attaches to the nitrogen atom on the peptide backbone. Depending on which bond in the cyclic imide breaks the des- amido peptide, the iso peptide or D-isomers result. In acidic media (pH 1 - 2) it is a slow reaction which seems to skip the succi nimide intermediate (Daniel et al., 1996). The peptides deamidate by dire ct hydrolysis. Cross et al. (1991) showed that the deamidation rate of asparagi ne in neutral and alkaline media is significantly influenced by the neighbouring amino acid on t he carboxyl side. Increasing size and branching of this residue decreased the rate of deamidation compared to that of the asparagine-glycine sequence which is most labile. Furthermore secondary and tertiary structures can have a stabilizing effect on asparagine residues, as they are Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 7 Ursula J. Bausch buried inside and ther efore inaccessible. It has been found that -helical as well as - turn structures have a tendency to protect asparagine against deamidation. Therefore certain proteins are only deamidated if t hey have undergone denaturation first. Besides acidic and alkaline pH, the deamidation rate is increased by high temperature. Ionic strength and the choice of a suitable buffer are important as the anion can have a catalytic effect. Along with deamidation, oxidation is the most common form of chemical degradation of peptide pharmaceuticals (Cleland et al, 1993). Oxidation can occur at cysteine and methionine residues, or at the heterocyclic aromatic side chains of histidine and tryptophan. The thio groups of cysteine and methionine ar e most prone to oxidation. Methionine residues are sensitive to oxid ation by atmospheric oxygen, like human growth hormone in a contai ner with only 0.4 % oxygen (Wang, 1999). The thio group of cysteine is oxidized to form disulfi de linkages; methionine is at a first stage reversibly oxidized to sulfoxide which can be further oxidized irreversibly to sulfone. The heterocyclic aromatic side chains of histidine and tryptophan form N-oxides. Several types of oxidants are known to c ause specific mechanism s of oxidation. The different oxidants react at specific site s in the protein and set free specific decomposition products. Organic peroxides represent a reactive species which oxidize methionine to sulfoxide through a nu cleophilic substitution reaction. Sources of organic peroxides are stoppers and silic one tubing as well as excipients like polysorbates. Furthermore singlet oxygen, which is generated through excitation by light, is a potential oxidant. Another source of reactive oxygen is redox-active metals like Fe(III) and Cu(II) which occur in trac es as contaminants of buffer salts and sugars (Meyer, 2002). The rate of oxidati on is influenced by the solution pH. In general it is increased in neutral to slightly alkaline media. -elimination is a frequent decomposition pathway of proteins, where cystine, cysteine, serine, phenylalanine, lysine an d threonine residues can be involved. Often -elimination contributes to further physica l degradation and leads to inactivation of the protein. The rate of -elimination is increased by al kaline pH, high temperature and the presence of metal ions (Manning et al., 1989). 8 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch The cleavage of disulfide bonds and forma tion of new bonds with another sulfhydryl group, i.e. exchange of disulfide bond, is a possible degradation mechanism. As disulfide bonds are oft en critical for the stability of the three-dimensional structure, interchange of disulfide bonds induce loss of activity. In neutral and alkaline pH the reaction is a nucleophilic attack of an i onized thiol group (thi and therefore catalyzed The reac tion can be inhibited by thiol scavengers (Manning et al., 1989). Disulfide exchange in acidic media follows a different mechanism. As all amino acids except gl ycine dispose of a chiral C-atom and hence a protein is composed of multiple chir al centres, the racemization reaction results in the formation of diastereomers. In alkaline media the reaction is considered to proceed through elimination of the -proton to form a negatively c harged planar carbanion. By addition of a proton to this intermediate a mixture of D- and L- enantiomers for the individual amino acid results. The rate of racemization is particularly high for aspartic acid residues in proteins, which is 10 5-fold higher than for the free amino acid, in comparison to a 2- to 4-fold increase for all other amino acids, as the mechanism involves the formation of a cyclic imide (Manning et al., 1989). C.1.3.2 Physica l degradation Proteins possess a specific conformational structure, which mini mizes the exposure of hydrophobic groups. This unique globul ar structure is a requirement for the proteins physiological and pharmacologica l activity. Physical degradation is the change of the native secondary or higher order fo lded structure. For proteins in dilute solutions (< 1 mg/ml) unfolding is often reversible, which means that the protein refolds to its native globula r structure if the favourabl e solution conditions are restored. However, at concentrations above 2 mg/ml, which is often encountered for pharmaceutical protein solutions, the two-state thermodynamic model is not applicable (Kendrick et al., 2002) . Intermolecular interact ions are likely to induce reversible and irreversible aggregation and precipitation. Possible irreversible physical degradation reactions which follow denaturation are: Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 9 Ursula J. Bausch non native aggregation precipitation adsorption to surfaces and interfaces The mechanisms of non-native protein aggr egation are not yet fully understood. Arakawa et al. (2006a) s uggested pathways for the formation of non-native aggregates according to Figure C.1.1 , where mechanism A1 starts from the presence of a contaminant. This contaminant, whic h could be damaged pr otein, host cell proteins, or even nonprotein material, may lead to the formation of soluble oligomers and subsequently could serve as a nucleus, wh ich induces assembly of further native protein. Figure C.1.1: Pathways of protein aggregation (Arakawa et al., 2006a) In second mechanism ( Figure C.1.1 , A2) proteins aggregat e from a partially unfolded state which was described as a transiently expanded conformational species within the native state ensemble (Kendrick et al., 1998b; Kim et al., 2001). The structure of proteins has to be considered as not t oo rigid and thus, the native conformational state fluctuates betw een a folded and a more expanded form. Kendrick et al., (1998b, 2002) suggested the scheme shown in Figure C.1.2 for the formation of aggregates of recombinant human interferon- . Non-native protein aggregation has been identified as a reversible modification of the native structure followed by an irreversib le aggregation step. 10 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch N N* A; (a) A + A n-1 A n ; (b) Figure C.1.2: Recombinant human interferon- aggregation mechanism In Figure C.1.2 , N* is a transiently expanded conformation in equilibrium with N. A is an aggregation-competent conf ormation. The transformation of N* to A is an irreversible reaction. A is a partially unfol ded conformation, also called molten globule or acid-denatured. Hy drophobic parts, which are buried in side the protein structure in native state, are exposed on the surface. A is prone to aggregation to minimize the exposed hydrophobic surface and therefore under goes assembly reactions to form larger aggregates. Non-native aggregates are characterized by an increased le vel of non-native intermolecular -sheet structures and a loss in -helical structures (Kendrick et al., 1998a + b). Aggregation is most critical as it regularly occurs during routine production steps like refoldin g, purification, sterilizati on, shipping and storage (Manning et al., 1989). In some cases the cause for protein aggregation is very difficult to be identified as the impairment of the protein happens at a different process step than the formation of the a ggregates. An example for this is the recombinant manufacturing of monoclonal ant ibodies, where the protein is exposed to low pH, but formation of aggregates is induced upon pH increase as shown in Figure C.1.1 , B. Even under favourable solution conditions and in absence of any applied stresses protein aggr egation can be observed. Aggregation leads to higher-order stru ctures which may be soluble but with increasing size the aggregates become insoluble and precipitation occurs. With increasing hydrophobicity of the protein, whether it is in native or unfolded conformation, adsorption to surfaces and in terfaces can be observed. Adsorption to glass or plastic surfaces as in vials or in fusion bags and adsorption to filters regularly pose problems in production. Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 11 Ursula J. Bausch C.1.4 Physical stability of proteins in aqueous solution Physical stability of proteins in solution is controlled by conformational and colloidal stability of the protein under the solution conditions. The role of conformational and colloidal stability was summarized by Chi et al. (2003b) in a review article. Conformational stability depends on the thermodynamic equilib rium of the native and the partially unfolded stat e and is characterized by Gunf, the free energy of unfolding. With increasing Gunf values the thermodynamic equilibrium is pushed towards the more compact native protein conformation. It was s hown for recombinant human interferon- that increasing Gunf resulted in a decreased aggregation rate (Kendrick et al, 1998a). The difference in free energy which stabilizes the native conformation is only approximately 5 - 20 kca l/mol compared to unfolded, denatured and biologically inactive conformations. Th is small conformational stability is the result of large stabilizing and large destabilizing forces. T he native state seems to be predominantly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions (Dill, 1990). Colloidal stability is reflected by the B 22 value, the osmotic se cond virial coefficient. The B 22 value is a measure for overall protei n-protein interactions, like Coulombic, van der Waals, and all other short range in teractions. It quantifies intermolecular interactions. Positive B 22 values show that protein-solvent interactions are favoured over protein-protein intera ctions and therefore repulsive forces between protein molecules are dominant. Negative B 22 values indicate that protein-protein interactions are dominant, i.e. proteins are colloidally uns table and assembly to aggregates is favoured (Chi et al., 2003a, 2003b). Thus to achieve a physically stable protei n solution the aggregation process, which consists of at least 2 steps, structural c hanges followed by an assembly step, has to be controlled by increasing conformational and colloidal stability. It has been shown for recombinant human granulocyte colony stim ulating factor that ei ther of the 2 steps can be rate limiting depending on the solution conditions (Chi et al., 2003a). 12 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch C.1.5 Physical factors affecting protein stability Protein degradation may be a ffected by a variety of physical factors, such as temperature, pH, agitation, exposure to interfaces and su rfaces, pressure, shearing, etc.. Wang (1999) has discussed these influencing factors on t he stability in a review article. These factors easily perturb the fragile balance between stabilizing and destabilizing factors. Temperature: Increasing te mperature usually leads to physical denaturation. Whereas electrostatic interactions are prac tically not affected by rising temperature, hydrogen bonding is diminished, and hydrophobic interactions are up to a certain limit enhanced. Denaturation may in so me cases be reversible depending on experimental conditions. High temperature accelerates as well chemical degradation reactions, such as hydrolysis and deamidat ion. Usually the thermodynamic stability of proteins, characterized by Gunf, the free energy of unfoldi ng, is positive within a temperature range; outside th is range, at temperatur es higher or lower, Gunf becomes negative and proteins are destabilized. Proteins are often stable within a narrow pH range. pH may strongly influence physical and chemical stability. Formulation pH defines the overall charge on the protein and its distribution, which influences electrostatic e ffects. If protein molecules are highly charged, the repulsive forces bet ween the molecules stabilize proteins in solutions colloidally and prevent aggregation and denaturation. On the other hand when a protein is highly charged, e.g. at pH far from the isoelectric point (pI), the density of charged groups on the molecule is high and may lead to an increased intramolecular charge repulsion which destabilizes the protein conformation. In addition specific electrostatic forces, such as salt bridges and ion pairing are affected and can have an influence on protein stabi lity (Wang, 1999; Chi et al., 2003b). During exposure to interfaces and surfaces proteins can suffer damage to their native structure. Due to their am phiphilic character, proteins tend to accumulate at hydrophobic surfaces and interfaces. They are aligned in a way to expose the hydrophobic residues to air and / or surface and unfold to maximize the exposed hydrophobic parts. Additionally a subsequent process of continuous adsorption and release of structurally perturbed protein molecules into the solution can occur and Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 13 Ursula J. Bausch cause further protein aggregat ion and denaturation (Randol ph et al., 2002). This can lead to very high percentages of loss of nat ive protein molecules. Depending on the extent of the surface active property, the degree of hydrophobic ity of the protein molecule and flexibility of the protein structur e, a protein is more or less sensitive to the exposure to surfaces and interfaces. The same applies to agitation and shearing, where new air / water or solid / water interfaces are continuously created and hydrophobic areas of proteins are exposed, initiating den aturation. Agitation and exposure to denaturing interfaces is one of the most common physical stresses as it occurs routinely during shipping and handl ing, as well as during processing operations, such as mixing, pumping and centrifugation of protein solutions. Maa and Hsu (1997) showed that recombinant human growth hormone formed noncovalent aggregates in the presence of high shear and air-liquid interface. Harrison et al. (1998) found that the binding activity of single-chain Fv antibody fragments decreased in a stirred vessel in the presence of air-liquid interfaces. There is evidence in literat ure that high pressure of a few hundred MPa can cause denaturation. The impact of pr essure on protein molecule s should be considered in certain manufacturing processes and in certain drug delivery devices. The volume of unfolded protein in solvent is smaller and therefore unfolded pr oteins are more compressible. It has been suggested that in trusion of water into the hydrophobic parts of the protein takes place under pressu re. The protein is des tabilized and as a result denatured (Kendrick et al., 2002). C.1.6 Stabilization of proteins Stabilization of protein molecules aims to protect sensitive f unctional groups in the native molecule from covalent degradation reactions, as we ll as protecting the folded native structure by intensifying the rigidity of the molecu le and thus make it less sensitive to unfold due to destabilizing effects. There are generally two possible approaches of stabilization of proteins: internal and ex ternal stabilization (Wang, 1999). Internal stabilization refers to any structural modifications to the protein molecule. External protein stabilization ap plies to stabilization by changing the properties of the solvent in contact with the molecule. 14 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch A search of literature reveals that a wide ra nge of possibilities to improve stability of protein therapeutics exists (Wang, 1999; Capelle et al., 2007). They can be divided in 3 groups: Stabilizing excipients, site -directed mutagenesis, and chemical modification. 1. Stabilizing excipients: The most common way to stabilize prot ein therapeutics is the addition of excipients to the formulation. The types of protein stabilizing excipients include sugars and polyols, salts, detergents, amino acids, am ins, polymers and metal ions, see Table C.1.1 with a list of commonly used excipients in protein formulations (Capelle et al., 2007). Polyalcohols, such as glycerol and s ugars, stabilize proteins by the preferential interaction mechanism (Ge kko et al., 1981a; Gekko et al., 1981b; Xie et al., 1997). One of the most studied excipients of this type is sucrose (Kim et al., 2003; Kendrick et al., 1998b; Lee and Timasheff, 1981). Sucrose is preferentially excluded form the protein's surface du e to repulsion from the protein backbone, which is thermodynamically unfavorabl e. Proportionally to the proteins' exposed surface, this interaction results in an increase of the chemical potential of the protein. By the LeChatelier principle, t he system will aim to minimize this thermodynamica lly unfavorable effect and therefore the protein is driven to the most compact conformation with the smallest surface area. Thus, the presence of sucros e shifts the equilibrium shown in Figure C.1.2 towards the more compact native state. The struct urally expanded species, which precedes protein aggregation, is disfavored. Therefore sucrose makes proteins more resistant agains t any stress that leads to a more expanded state of th e protein. Preferentially ex cluded excipients may also reduce chemical degradation as the accessi bility of buried inside side chains is reduced. The Wyman linkage function wa s applied by Timasheff et al. (e.g. Timasheff, 1998) to protein conformational stability and can be used to explain the mechanism of preferential exclusi on. Excipients that are preferentially excluded are also known as cosolutes or cosolvents and include as well salts and amino acids. Preferential interacti on was measured for various cosolutes added to protein solutions and it was found that this mechanism can explain Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 15 Ursula J. Bausch the impact of cosolutes on protein solu bility and stability (Lee et al., 1974; 1981; and buffers have complex effects on protein stability, where the influence of buffers is not limited to having the appropriate pK a for the formulation. Depending on the type and concentration of the salt, the charged groups of the protein and the type of ionic interact ions between them, salts may have a stabilizing, a destabilizing or no effe ct. At high concentrations salts can stabilize proteins through the preferential exclusion mechanism. The effect correlates with the Hofmeister series for anions (Kendrick et al., 2002): Br- > I- > ClO 4-. Salts at low concentrations predominant ly influence stability of proteins in solution by non-specific electrostatic shielding (Debye screening). Electrostatic interactions between charged groups ar e reduced, which can stabilize the protein. Furthermore specif ic ion binding to a protei n can occur and may also lead to a stabilization of the protein. Howe ver, if ions bind more strongly to the nonnative protein conformation, destabiliza tion of the native st ate results (Chi et al., 2003). Detergents are often added to protein formu lations to inhibit aggregation and adsorption to surfaces and interfac es. Both, protein and detergents are surface active molecules. At interfaces and surfaces they or ient in a way to minimize exposure of hydrophobic parts to the aqueous solution, which for proteins can lead to damage of the native conformation. The addition of surfactants lowers the su rface tension of the solu tion and reduces the number of protein molecules adsorbed to surfac es and interfaces and therefore has a stabilizing effect on protein solutions. Nonionic surfactants, such as polysorbates are routinely used. Randolph et al. (2002) give an overview of surfactant-protein interactions. Arakaw a et al. (2003) have shown that Tween 20 protects effectively ciliary neutrotrophic factor from aggregation caused by agitation. Bam et al. (1998) found that Tween 20 used in molar ratios > 4 inhibits aggregation of human growth hormone during agitation. Vidanovic et al. (2003) observed that Tween 80 and Crem ophor EL employed close to the 16 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch critical micelle concentration destabilized IgG in solution and stabilized it in the presence of glycine. Polymers stabilize proteins by one or more of the following properties: preferential exclusion, surface activity , steric hindrance of protein-protein interactions, increased viscosity leading to limitation of structural movement (Wang, 1999). Some proteins can be stabilized by metal ions like zinc, calcium and magnesium. They bind to t he protein and intensify t he rigidity of the whole structure resulting in an ov erall more stable and resist ant state of the protein. In literature many examples can be found for this mechanism, e.g. it has been shown that insulin is stabilized by calcium or zinc ions (Wang, 1999). Hydrophilic cyclodextrins may also protect proteins from aggregation. This has been shown for recombinant human growth hormone using hydrophilic - cyclodextrins (Tavornvipas et al ., 2004), suggesting that hydrophilic - cyclodextrins are pot entially useful excipients for parenteral preparation. Furthermore Tavornvipas et al. (2006) found that the use of the appropriate cyclodextrin is also dependent on the type of the denaturating stress on the protein. 2. Site-directed mutagenesis Protein stability can be influenced by modifying amino acids through site- directed mutagenesis. To enhance stability of proteins by change of amino acids, labile amino acids can by exchanged, hydrogen and disulfide bond can be increased, internal hydrophobi city can be increased and surface hyrophobicity lowered, flexibility and charge density can be decreased. However, the overall protein co nformation has to be preserved. 3. Chemical Modification The introduction of charge groups or wa ter soluble polymers as polyethylene glycol and glycosylation results in a more hydrophilic surface of the protein which as well fortifies the in tramolecular interaction. Th is can stabilize proteins Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 17 Ursula J. Bausch and is referred to chemical modification. A further possibility to make the protein structure more rigid is to introduce inter-and intramolecular cross linking using bifunctional reagents (Halbeisen, 1993). C.1.7 Protein formulations Typically proteins are formulated as soluti on for injection or infusion. If for stability reasons a liquid preparation is not possible, usually a lyophilisate is developed. For a stable liquid preparation cont rol of pH and ionic str ength is imperative. In Table C.1.1 an overview of commonly used excipients in pr otein formulations is given (Capelle et al., 2007). A typical formulation contains: buffer salt as citrate or phosphate pH adaptation to physiological pH or as close as possible, if not stable a surfactant is added to prevent adsorption to container surfaces Table C.1.1: List of commonly used excipients in protein solutions Excipient Examples Salts Ammonium The included excipients are FDA approved for par enteral administration and part of the inactive ingredients list or part of FDA approved biopharm aceuticals et Mannin et al., 1993; Gupta et al., 2003; Arakawa et al., 2001; Powell et al., 1998). As cryo-protectants for freeze-dried forms , non-reducing sugars such as sucrose and trehalose are used. It was found that trehalos e is involved in stabilizing membranes and proteins in animals surviving in dr y environment and in anhydrobiotic organisms 18 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch and was first introduced as excipient by Genentech for Herceptin\u00ae (Capelle et al., 2007). A great challenge is the devel opment of highly concentra ted preparations above 100 mg/ml, which are needed for subcutaneous administration (Harris et al., 2004). C.1.8 Methods for characterization of proteins C.1.8.1 Analytical techniques in protein characterization A wide range of chemical and physical analytical methods including their principles for the characterization of pr oteins and monitoring of in stabilities is available in literature. For each protein product a number of anal ytical methods should be selected and customized to accomplish it s specific needs. Biological assays to determine the biological activity of a protei n are as essential as the determination of structural properties as the biological activity is dependent on the structure. Table C.1.2 gives an overview of commonly used anal ytical methods including their major applications (Wang, 1999). Table C.1.2: Analytical methods used in protein characterization Analytical techniques Major applications Analytical centrifugation Protein aggregation CE Protein degradation, Determination of T m CD Estimation of secondary structure, Determination of T m, Probing protein conformation, Determination of multimers DSC Determination of T g, Determination of T m, Protein unfolding Electron paramagnetic Ligand-protein interactions resonance (EPR) Fluorescence Protein unfolding/inte raction, Determination of T m, Probing protein conformation HPLC-ion exchange Protein degradation and aggregation HPLC-reversed phase Pr otein degradation and aggregation, Estimation of contamination HPLC-size exclusion Protein degradation and aggregation, Estimation of contamination IR Estimation of secondary structures, Determination of T m, Probing protein conformation Karl Fischer Water determination Light scattering Protein aggregation MS Determination of molecular weight, degradation products and contaminants NMR Determination of 3-D and secondary structures, Protein relaxation and softening, Protein unfolding Raman spectroscopy Determinat ion of secondary structures Refractometry Ligand-protein interactions UV/visible spectroscopy Determination of T m, Protein aggregation, Estimation of contamination, Probing protein conformation Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 19 Ursula J. Bausch Further methods which have successfully been used in quantification of protein aggregation are assymetrical flow field flow analytical ultracentrifugation ( SV-AUC) (Gabrielson et al., 2007). However, there is still a lack of analytical methods which can be used to directly examine protein structure and st ability at high concentrations without prior dilution or concentration changes during the measur ement process (Harn et al., 2007). Following the methods used for this work are described in more detail. C.1.8.2 Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS) Photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) is a method based on time-dependent or dynamic light scattering, which can be used for particle sizing of pa rticles in the range of a few microns that are suspended in a liquid (Weiner, 1984). Determination of the size and size distributions is a common application of PCS (Janmey, 1993). Particles with diameters in the range from 1 to 5000 nm, dependent on sample considerations and the available laser power can be measured (Zetasizer 1000 /2000/3000, 1996; M\u00fcller et al., 1997). Protein aggregates resulting from protein degradation can be detected by measuring the particle size and particle size di stributions of proteins in solution. The size of aggregates can be determined by dynamic light scattering, however for measuring the exact composit ion of multimodal distributions and the percentage of aggregated protein in solution a prior s eparation step by e.g. SEC- HPLC or asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation is necessary (Demeule et al., 2007). C.1.8.2.1 Principle The Brownian motion of suspended particles in solution causes time dependent intensity fluctuations of li ght scattered from the particl es. The changes in intensity with time are dependent on the size of particles, as small particles move more rapidly than large particles. These changes ca n be detected with suitable optics and a photomultiplier. The rate of fluctuations of the scattered light is higher for small particles. The scattered light is detected usua lly at an angle of 90\u00b0 of the laser beam. 20 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch A correlator calculates from the measured time dependent variations in intensity of scattered light an autocorrelation function. A theoretical correlation function according to Equation C.1.1 is adapted to the measured autocorrelation function: () g Equation C.1.1 where =2sin4 nK Equation C.1.2 where is the correlation time, D is the diffusion coefficient and K is the scattering vector (dependent on refractive index of solvent n, wa velength of laser source and detection angle ). D is the only variabl e factor in Equation C.1.1 and can be related to hydrodynamic particle radius R h using the Stokes-Einstein equation: DT kRh = 6 Equation C.1.3 Where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is absolute temperature and is solvent viscosity. C.1.8.2.2 Data analysis For the characterization of the protein solutions the following parameters are used: Cumulants Analysis: The analysis of the aut ocorrelation function can be performed with the cumulants analysis, where the nor malized and logarithmized autocorrelation function is equated with the quadratic term: a + b + c2. The logarithmized theoretical correlation function (see Equation C.1.1) is a straight line, as is the logarithmized autocorrelation function of a m onodisperse distribution. b is the slope of the straight line and rela ted to the z average mean. c re flects the deviation of the autocorrelation function from the theoretical correlation f unction and is related to the polydispersity. The deviation increas es with increasing polydispersity. Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 21 Ursula J. Bausch Z average mean: Mean hydrodynamic di ameter obtained from the cumulants analysis. Polydispersity index (PI): PI is calculated with the constants b and c and describes the width of the particle size distribution. It is obtained from t he cumulants analysis. A differentiation between a broad distribution and a bimodal distribution is not possible using the cumulants analysis. Contin analysis: The contin -algorithm is a complex mathematical calculation operation to determine a particle size dist ribution from the autocorrelation function. During this mathematical operation 12 possi ble distributions ar e calculated and the best fit result is displayed. As the cont in analysis is good at determining smooth distributions and finding contam inants it is suitable to det ect protein agglomerations in very low concentrations. However the resolution of this analysis is low. C.1.8.3 Size-Exclusion HPLC SEC-HPLC is an important method for the characterization of highly molecular substances as proteins or polymers. It is the basic method in aggregation analysis to determine and quantify aggr egation levels for protein pharmaceuticals and practically always required for regulatory ap proval (Arakawa et al., 2006a). Principle: Molecules are separated due to their difference in size and shape of the solutes, i.e. their hydrodynamic volume. The principal of this method is shown in Figure C.1.3 . The stationary phase consists of a porous material of a defined pore size diameter. Molecules with a larger di ameter that cannot permeat e into the pores pass the column with the mobile phase and elute fi rst. Small molecules that permeate freely into the pores are retarded and take the longest time to pass the column. Molecules of an intermediate size bet ween the two extremes ar e partially excluded and separated due to their size and occasionally as well due to their shape. They are detected at different retenti on volumes. The retention volu me is calculated from the retention time according to Equation C.1.4 . 22 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch Equation C.1.4 flowrate R RV t V = where V R is the retention volume which describes the retention behavior, t R is the retention time and V flowrate is the flow rate of the mobile phase. Figure C.1.3: Principal of SEC-HPLC (Otto, M., 2000) Stationary phase: Routinely, columns with chemically modified polar phases like hydrophilic silica gel of a particle size around 5 to 10 \u00b5m and constant distributions of pore size diameter are used. The distribution of pore si zes should be as narrow as possible. The ratio of the total pore volume to the void volume should be as high as possible to improve the peak capacity. The separation efficiency can be increased by using small, regular stat ionary phase particles and by a narrow, long and densely packed column (Stulik et al., 2003). Furt hermore it can be enhanced by injecting small sample volumes and reducing the flow rate. The limit of exclusion from a column corresponds to the molecular size in Dalton above which no retention can be observed anymore. It is dependent on the pore size of the material of the stationary phase and the hydrodynamic volume of the molecule. Mobile phase: The choice of the mob ile phase depends on the solubility of the material to be analyzed. For water soluble material aqueous elution media containing a buffer for pH control are used. For poorly water-soluble substances apolar organic solvents in combination with hydr ophobic packing materials are used. Electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions of the solutes with the stationary phase compromise the pure size exclusion mech anism and should as far as possible be suppressed by modifying t he stationary and mobile phase accordingly. Literature Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 23 Ursula J. Bausch gives evidence that proteins tend to bi nd to columns during SEC -HPLC (Arakawa et al., 2006a; Stulik et al., 2003; Gabrie lson et al., 2007), leading to abnormal chromatograms, protein loss, column damage and inaccurate protein molecular weight data (Ejima et al., 2005). This is especially true for soluble aggregates. In Figure C.1.4 possible mechanisms of protein binding to the stat ionary phase are shown, where in SEC-HPLC proteins tend to bind according to step C (Tsumoto et al., 2007). For recombinant hum an platelet-activating factor acteylhydrolase it has been found that it reversibly binds to silica surface (step A) followed by an irreversible conformation modification (step B) which leads to the formation of aggregates (Chi et al., 2005). Figure C.1.4: Schematic illustration of protein binding to column resin (Tsumoto et al., 2007) To decrease these interactions e.g. the active surface silanol groups of silica-based columns can be masked with de xtran or agarose. The m obile phase can be adapted in terms of pH, ionic strength and the content of organic modifier in order to suppress hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (Stu lik et al., 2003). Tsumoto et al. give in a review article (2007) an overview of salt effects on protein-surface interactions applied to column chromatography. Salt s can have nonspecific charge shielding effects on proteins and column chromat ography due to their ionic properties and specific effects which refer to salting-in and salting-out effects of certain salts at 24 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch identical concentrations. In SEC-HPLC relati vely low concentrations of salts are often sufficient to prevent nonspecific binding (Tsumoto et al., 2007). For arginine hydrochloride it was demonstr ated to be very efficient in suppressing nonspecific binding of proteins as well as their aggregates to the stationary phase when added to the mobile phase in concentrat ions of 0.2 to 0.75 M (Ejima et al., 2005; Arakawa et al., 2006a+b). Recovery and peak separation were enhanced by arginine hydrochloride. Arakawa et al. ( 2007) discussed in a review article various mechanisms of how arginine influences pr oteins and suggested that it acts via interacting favorably with amino acid si de chains and limited binding on the proteins' surface, which inhibits aggregation but does not destabilize the protein. C.2 Regulatory Background C.2.1 Manufacturing conditions Protein instability is one of the reasons why protein pharmaceuticals are formulated for parenteral administrati on and not e.g. for oral administration (Wang, 1999). Furthermore, most protein pharmaceutical s are sensitive to heat and therefore cannot be finally sterilized by steam sterilization. For sterile preparation without sterilization in the final container, t he GMP guideline demands a preparation under aseptic processing is to maintain the sterility of a product that is assembled fr om components, each of which has been sterilized by steam, dry heat, ioni zing radiation, gas or filtration. Sterility of a product cannot be guaranteed by testing. As eptic production processes have to be validated by 3 consecutive successful process simulation tests using microbial growth media (media fill tests) to be controlled by measures as: bioburden of the solution before filtration filter integrity tests after use Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 25 Ursula J. Bausch microbiological controls during production: personnel, surface contact plates, air samplin g, sedimentation plates online particle monitoring sterility testing of the pr oduct in the final container C.2.2 Requirements on pare nteral preparations The European Pharmacopoeia (2006a) spec ifies in the mo nograph parenteral preparations, the requirements for sterile so lutions administered by injection like protein solutions. Solutions for injecti on must be clear and practically free from particles. They have to comply with the test for sterility, the test for particulate contamination: sub-visible particles, test for uniformity of content and the test for bacterial endotoxins or pyr ogens. As protein degradation often results in aggregation and precipitation, particles in the solution present besides othe r points a critical aspect. C.2.2.1 Test for visible particles The test for visible particles accord ing to the European Pharmacopoeia (2006b) describes a simple procedure for a visual inspection of parenteral solutions. The aim is to assess the quality of the solution in respect to particulate contamination consisting of mobile undi ssolved particles other than gas bubbles. The visual inspection is performed with the help of a viewing station consisting of a matt black and a non-glare white panel in vertical position next to each other and a suitable white-light source. Non-l abeled containers that are cl ean and dry on the outside are inspected for particles by gent ly swirling and observing 5 sec in front of the white panel and in front of the black panel. As it is a non-destructive method a 100% control can be performed. C.2.2.2 Test for sub-visible particles The test for sub-visible particles accord ing to the European Pharmacopoeia (2006c), which has to be performed for solutions for injection, is conducted using the light obscuration particle count test. The method allows a determi nation of a size 26 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch distribution using the principle of light blockage. A suitable inst rument calibrated with spherical particles of known size between 10 \u00b5m and 25 \u00b5m is used to examine a statistically relevant number of test specimens after sample preparation. Solutions for injection with a nominal volume of equal or less than 100 ml comply with the test if the average number of particles in the tested units does not exceed 6000 per container equal to or grater than 10 \u00b5m and 600 per cont ainer equal to or greater than 25 \u00b5m. Solutions with a nominal volume of more than 100 ml comply with the test if the average num ber of particles in the tested samples does not exceed 25 per ml equal to or grater than 10 \u00b5m and 3 per ml equal to or grat er than 25 \u00b5m. The microscopic particle count test is avai lable as a second back-up method in the European Pharmacopoeia (2006c). C.3 Manufacturing of Protein Pharmaceuticals Large scale manufacturing of protein pharmac euticals, e.g. recombinant monoclonal antibodies is well established in indus try and range from 10 liter to 10 000 liter volumes. In Figure C.3.1 , as an example, the schem atic production flow of manufacturing a recombinant antibody is s hown (Harris et al, 2004). The production process can generally be divided into two processing parts. The first one concerns the manufacturing of the active pharmaceut ical ingredient, i.e. the protein drug substance. In the second part the drug substance is formulated to manufacture the drug product in the final dosage form. Followi ng the two parts are briefly described. Cell culture expansion (seed strain to production) Harvest (centrifugation, tangential and / or normal flow filtration) Purification (chromatography, and/or membrane steps) Formulation Final vial filling Figure C.3.1: Recombinant antibody production process flow Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 27 Ursula J. Bausch C.3.1 Biotechnological Part - Manuf acturing of protein drug substance The capability for producing large amounts of high qualit y proteins is based on the availability of two biotechnologies. Re combinant DNA is utilized to produce the desired protein in the first one. The gene whic h is responsible for the generation of a certain amino acid sequence of a protei n is isolated, modified and subsequently recombined with a plasmid DNA, an extr achromosomal, independently replicating small circular DNA molecule. Restriction enzymes cut DNA at specific places and ligase connects the DNA fragment with the plasmid. The modified plasmid is then introduced into a host cell where it is replicated and transcribed to produce the specific protein. For example Escherichia coli are used for the production of insulin, human growth hormone, interleukin-2 and in terferon. Another production technique for insulin utilizes Saccharomyces cerevisi ae. CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cell lines are used for the expression of tissue plasminogen activator, coagulation factor VIII and erythropoietin (Schmid, 2002). In the case of Escherichia coli, proteins are expressed in the cytoplasm at high concentra tions and result in insoluble inclusion bodies and/or soluble proteins. To release the expressed protein, usually the cells need to be destructed chemically or mechanically. Usually water is used to lyse the cells; however buffers may be used to improve the recovery rate in the supernatant. The further purification st eps are depending if soluble folded proteins, soluble misfolded proteins or insoluble inclusion bodies are concerned. Different washing and purification steps are involved. For exam ple in the case of insoluble inclusion bodies a solubilisation, purification and refold ing is required to obtain the protein. An overview of the different possibilities for washing and purification methods is given by Arakawa et al. (2002). The second technology is the hybridoma tec hnique, which is foll owing exemplified by describing the production of mo noclonal antibodies. A specific antigen is injected into a test animal. The immune response is init iated and the production of antibodies by B-lymphocytes starts. The antibody-producing B-lymphocyt es are isolated from the spleen of the test animal and are in the pres ence of polyethylene glycol in vitro fused with cells of a lymphocyte tumour (myeloma cells) to form hybridoma cells (R\u00f6mpp- Lexikon, 1999). Hybridoma cells can be held in culture and indefinitely divided due to their tumour like attributes. The hybridom a cells expressing the desired antibody are selected using immunoassays and cell cloni ng. The best clones can be preserved for 28 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch many years by deep-freezing them. The hybr idoma cells are cultured in bioreactors in complex culture media containing besides glucose, fetal bovine serum as nutrient. Supply of oxygen and CO 2 is necessary. In industrial scale they are preferably grown in suspension as batch or continuous pr oduction process. A fed batch process, where the production phase in the bioreactor is prol onged by addition of nutrient medium, is preferred as the yield can be increased to several grams antibody per litre. Contrary to micro-organisms, no lysi s is necessary for animal cells as the product is secreted. Subsequently a purificat ion protocol is followed. Typically a concentration by ultrafiltration is performed, followed by a pre-purif ication by binding to protein A. Then the monoclonal antibody is further purified by ion-exchange chromatography and by ination of gel chromatography (Schmid, 2002). The purificatio n as well includes a treatment for viral inactivation; most effective for that purpose is an ex posure to acid (Ejima et al., 2006). C.3.2 Pharmaceutical part - Manufacturing of the final dosage form The formulation step transforms the purified bul k protein drug substance into the final solution composed of a defined concentra tion of protein and excipients. Methods used for the formulation step include large-sca le size exclusion chromatography and ultrafiltration. For the pr eparation of high-concentrati on formulations, which are desirable for example for subcutaneous administ ration, ultrafiltration is the preferred method (Harris et al., 2004). A standard production process for an aseptic ally manufactured product includes the following steps: The solution is prepared in a clean room Class C under laminar air flow class A using the protein to be formulated, excipients and water for injection or as mentioned above. The solution is filtered th rough a sterile filter of pore size 0.2 \u00b5m into the class A of a cleanroom class A/B. T he filtered solution is t hen filled into previously depyrogenated and sterilized glass vials or am poules of hydrolytic class I using a suitable filling and dosing machine or device. Complete filling lines are used for high performance output (starti ng from 24000 vials / hour) consisting of a washing machine for glass containers, a ster ilizing/ depyrogenation tunnel, filling and stoppering machine and crimping machine. The solution is filtered inline through a Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 29 Ursula J. Bausch sterile filter 0.2 \u00b5m. Filled vials are closed with previous ly sterilized stoppers followed by crimping; ampoules are closed by se aling with heat. Cleanroom conditions class A in B are imperative for all steps wher e open product or primary packaging components are handled. Different dosing systems are available for the filling operation, as for example: rotary piston pumps: the principle is based on volumetric displacement; see Figure . peristaltic pumps: a forward flow of solu tion in an elastic tubing is driven by peristaltic movement. time-pressure dosing system: the dosing ve ssel is kept at constant pressure; pressure differences are compensated wit h gas (usually nitrogen); dosing via valves, that are opened for a fixed time ; the whole process is controlled via a programmable logic controller (PLC) or microprocessor. weight-dosing system: dosing valves open till the desired fill weight is achieved; the weight is constantly measured with weighing cells during the dosing process; the process is controlled via PLC. sensor dosing system: is based on a prin cipal to fill a cont ainer and stop at a given level of product inside the contai ner. A sensor is used to monitor the liquid level. This system is often used for containers which have to be filled 100% without leaving an air bubble in the container as for example dental cartridges. Another advantage is that no product retracti on is necessary at the end of filling due to the tolerance of t he container, which minimizes the loss of product. 30 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch 1. Aspiration of bulk solution 2. Piston rotation 3. Filling 4. Piston rotation The groove of the piston is directed to the bulk solution container. The piston is moving upwards and aspirates the solution into the pump. The piston makes a 180\u00b0 rotation. The groove of the piston is directed to the filling needle. The piston is moving downwards. The solution is ejected and dosed into the final container. The piston makes a 180\u00b0 rotation. The groove of the piston is directed to the bulk solution container. Figure C.3.2: Functional principle of rotary piston pumps (Bausch Advanced Technology Group, 2007). Rotary piston pumps are solid precision ma chine parts, without valves and seals, which are easy and fast to clean. Further advantages of this dosing system are that they have a minimal dead quantity and are very flexible in terms of different dosing quantities. Advantages of t he time-pressure system and the weight-dosing system are that there are few pr oduct contacting parts and a br oad processing spectrum as they are as well suitable to fill suspens ions and abrasive media. The time-pressure system is suitable for high-performance processing. Aspects, which should be considered when c hoosing a dosing system, are that it is easy to clean and sterilize, preferable a CIP/SIP system is available, that it has a high dosing precision and the physical stress for the product is low if the product is sensitive to this. Furthermore the format change should be easy and quick. C.4 Shear forces during filling and dosing During processing of pharmaceutical solutions the latter are subjected to various stresses. There is a lot of evidence in literatu re that particularly proteins are prone to suffer under physical stress like for example high temper ature, hydrodynamic shear stress (Elias et al., 1998), exposure to su rfaces and interfaces during shaking and Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 31 Ursula J. Bausch foaming combined with high shear (Maa et al., 1996, 1997). The exerted physical stress can lead to protein degradation, agglomeration and precipitation. Rotary piston pumps have often been questioned for filling sensitive compounds as for example proteins, due to the potential risk of damage through shear forces that could occur, when passing thro ugh the pump. In this wo rk the notions shear and shear forces are used in the sense of ph ysical stress caused by filling systems. This includes the following stresses and their comb inations but is not limited to these: shear stress in the gap between the cylinder and the piston in a rotary piston pump caused by the move ments of the piston hydrodynamic shear stress caused by fluid motion physical stress due to exposure to surfaces and interfaces The shear stress is defined according to Equation C.4.1. = Equation C.4.1 where is shear rate and is solution viscosity. The conditions in a rotary piston pump in re spect to the average shear rate for the rotational movement is comparable to the conditions in a concentric cylinder shear device where the solution is introduced into the gap betw een two cylinders with the inner cylinder rotating. The radii of the cylinders are given by R o for the outer and Ro for the inner cylinder. Maa et al. (1996) derived and calculated the average shear rate <> as follows: ()222 11ln 4 = Equation C.4.2 where is the ratio between the radii of the inner and outer cylinder and is the rotating rate of the inner cylinder in radians/second. 32 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch The maximum shear rate occurs at the surf ace of the inner cylin der. An increase in the shear rate can be achieved by values for close to 1, which means to diminish the distance between inner and outer cylinder. The average shear can be calculated by multiplying the shear rate with the time spent in the shear field (Maa et al., 1996). Charm and Wong (1970) investigated shear damage for three enzymes when flowing through a capillary tube and found that the degree of inactivation was dependent on the shear rate and the time of exposure and was represented by t he product of the two parameters. The hydrodynamic shear stress in a cylindrical tube for a laminar uni-directional flow is zero at the centre of the tube an increases towa rds the inner surface of the tube, where it is maximal. The calculation of the shear stress results from Equation C.4.3 (Elias et al., 1998). LP r =2 Equation C.4.3 where r is the radial distance from the tube axis, P is the pressure drop between two points situated at distance L. C.5 Aim of the work It is well known that during manufacturing pharmaceutical solutions are subjected to various stresses, e.g. during stirring, ster ilization. However not so much is known about physical stress which might occur duri ng filling and dosing operations. In the scope of this study, the impact of physica l stress caused by dosing equipment is examined. By circulating a m odel solution in a suitable test system the impact of shear forces on the model solution is to be evaluated. As dosing equipment a peristaltic pump and rotary piston pumps are examined, compared and evaluated. Influencing parameters of the dosing operation like the dosing equipment itself, filling volume, speed, exposed surface during the operation shall be investigated. The objective is to better understand the filli ng and dosing process and to evaluate where the potential shear stress orig inates from. The obtained c onclusions shall be utilized Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 33 Ursula J. Bausch to optimize the process as well as the equi pment and to establish rules which shall be respected for filling shear sensitive products. As small chemical entities are unlikely to show an effect, t he focus for a model substance concentrates on protein solutions. Literature gives evidence that proteins are sensitive to physical stress and can su ffer damage from it. A protein which is sensitive enough to shear stress as it might occur in the present study has to be searched and evaluated in co mbination with the experi mental test system and an analytical method which can moni tor the impact on the protein. Subsequently excipients and their combinati ons are evaluated for their protective effect for the kind of physi cal stress encountered in the respective dosing equipment. As protein pharmaceuticals are administe red as parenteral dosage forms, all considerations for the present study ha ve to be made in respect of sterile manufacturing. C.6 Model Substances The search for a model protein from vari ous protein groups like hormones, vaccines, cytokines and enzymes concentrated at fi rst on the group of enzymes. The reason for this choice was that many enzymes ar e commercially available and the availability of simple enzymatic assays to determine the activity. -galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae was used for shear tests in this work because of its molecular weight of about 105 kDa (Tanaka et al., 1975). This corresponds to an average molecular weight for enzymes. Furthermore it is very stable, and an easy to handle enzyme activity test which delivers reliable results is available. After the first shear tests it became obvious that for -galactosidase no degradation following exposure to shear stress could be detected. To examine different parameters concerning dosin g operations a second model protein was searched which is highly sensitive to shear forces as they occur in the shear model used in this 34 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch study. Immunoglobulins in general are know n to denature under various conditions including among others temperature change and shear (Wang et al., 2007). Rituximab was selected for this purpose. The following chapters give a short over view of the character and properties of - galactosidase and rituximab. C.6.1 -Galactosidase -galactosidase is as widely distributed nature as its substrates, oligo- and polysaccharides containing D-galactose joined through a -glycosidic bond (Wallenfels and Weil, 1972). The universal occurrence on the one hand and the simple enzymatic assay and the great number of substrat es on the other hand led to a lot of research done on structure and behaviour of -galactosidase, which varies depending on the organism source. C.6.1.1 Structure and catalytic reaction Structure analysis done by Tanaka et al. (1975) and Akasaki et al. (1976) showed that -galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae has unlike the molecule from Escherichia , which is a tetramer, no subunit stru cture and a molecular weight of 105 kDa. The molecular weight corresponds mo re or less to the size of one monomer from Escherichia coli . Therefore it is suppos ed that the structure of -galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae is similar to that of the monomer of Escherichia coli . Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 35 Ursula J. Bausch Figure C.6.1: Structure of a monomer of -galactosidase from E. coli . D1-D5 indicate the five domains, a indicates the active site (Juers et al., 2000). __ depict Na+ exam the structure of -galactosidase from E. coli. The monomer (116 kDa) consists of five struct ural domains and an active site, which is located at the C-terminal end of the central core of domain 3 and includes also parts of loops from domain 1, 2 and 5. Magnesium ions are present in the active site. Table C.6.1 shows the amino acid composition of -galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae (Tanaka et al., 1975). 36 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J.

This is followed by the formation of the in termediary complex ES' with simultaneous elimination of the agl yconic leaving group P 1. The ES' complex is hydrolysed to yield free galactose P 2 and the enzyme E (Wallenfels and Weil, 1972). Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 37 Ursula J.

The galactose part of the galactose-enzyme co hydrolysed releasing the enzyme (Stellmach, 1988). C.6.1.2 Physicochemical properties and stability Tanaka et al. (1975) invest igated the properties of -galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae and found that the enzyme showed pH optima of 4.5 with OPNG-1 as a substrate and 4.8 with lactose as a substrat e. Furthermore a stable pH range from 4.0 to 9.0 was detected. The optimum temperatur e was found to be 46 \u00b0C. C.6.2 Rituximab Rituximab is a therapeutic m onoclonal antibody for intrav enous injection which has been licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997 to treat Non- Hodgkin's lymphoma. Following a short over view on the properties, structure and mechanism of action and of rituximab and m onoclonal antibodies in general is given. 38 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch C.6.2.1 Monoclonal Antibodies Monoclonal antibodies are genet ically engineered antibodi es using mammalian cell lines. Hybridoma cells, which result from a fusion of immune cells with tumor cells, have the ability to produce a specific antibod y and at the same time grow in cultures. This was achieved by Mils tein and K\u00f6hler, who received the Nobel price for their research. The monoclonal antibody is then purified and concentrated. Rituximab is manufactured using Chinese Hamster Ovary cell suspension in a nutrient medium. The subsequent purification is done by affinity and ion exchange chromatography. A specific viral inacti vation and removal procedure is performed (Patient Information Leaflet Rituxan\u00ae, 2002). C.6.2.2 Structur e chimeric murine monoclonal antibody. It is a type IgG 1kappa immunoglobulin, which consists of two heavy chains of 451 amino acids and two light chains of 213 amino acids (Pat ient Information Leaflet Rituxan\u00ae, 2002). The molecular weight is approxim ately 145 kD, which is a typi cal molecular weight for monoclonal antibodies (Wang et al., 2007). T he light and heavy chains show murine variable region sequences and human cons tant region sequences, as shown in Figure C.6.3 . The variable regions are marked with V; constant regions with C. Figure C.6.3: Chimeric monoclonal antibody (Br\u00fcggemeier, M., 2005) The target of rituximab is the CD20 transmembrane antigen on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. Rituximab molecules bind sp ecifically to the CD20 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 39 Ursula J. Bausch antigen with a binding affini ty of approximately 8.0 nM. An immunological response induces the lysis of the B lymphocytes. Ge nerally there are 2 known pathways for the cell lysis, the complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and ediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) mechanism (Arzneimittelkompendium der Schweiz, 2001). Research in this field is on-going to gain more understanding of t he cell-killing mechanisms of anti-tumor antibodies such as rituximab, e.g. (Idusogie et al., 2000). C.6.2.3 Physicochemical properties and stability Rituximab is stable as a liquid formulation. The concentrated solution of 10 mg /ml, as commercially available on the market, in a citrate buffer solution at a pH of 6.5 has a shelf life of 48 months. It is stable wh en stored at 2 - 8 \u00b0C and it should be protected from direct sunli ght. Wang et al. (2007) give an overview in their review article of the stability of m onoclonal antibodies in general. 40 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch DD MMAATTEERRIIAALLSS AANNDD MMEETTHHOODDSS Chemie molecular weight of 105 kD was prepar ed by dissolving 1 mg/ml of the enzyme powder in phosphate buffer solution. The phosphate buffer solution pH 4.5 contained 17.8 mg/ml disodium hydrogenphosphate (Merck AG, Darmstadt, Germany) and 12.4 mg/ml citric acid (H\u00e4nseler AG, Herisau, Switzerland) in distilled water. The enzyme solution was diluted 1:10 with phosphate buffer solution to obtain a solution containing approximately 0.1 mg/ml -galactosidase enzyme powder. D.1.2 Rituximab with a mo lecular weight of 145 kD was used. It was supplied by Roche, Basel as a sterile, clear, colourless and preservative-free solution at a concentration of 10 mg/ml form ulated in 9 mg/ml sodium citrate dihydr ate, 0.7 mg/ml polysorbate 80, and Water for Injection. The solution pH was 6.5. It was ob tained in 10 ml and 50 ml vials. D.1.3 Excipients A fundamental condition for the choice of excipients for the stabilization of rituximab against shear stress was the compatibility for the use in parenteral dosage forms. The properties of the selected excipients for evaluation of their pr otective effect are briefly described in this chapter. Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 41 Ursula J.

D.1.3.2 Formulation The excipients were added to the formulated rituximab solution described in chapter D. 1.2.1. In total 5 different formul ations with excipients were prepared: Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 43 Ursula J. Bausch original solution + 0.1% Polyglycol 6000 + 1% Trehalose dihydrate + 0.5% Polyglycol 6000 original solution + 1.24% Tween 80. As 0.07 % Tween 80 is already in the original solution a total concentration of Tween 80 of 1.31 % results. The excipients were weighed on an analy tical balance Range (Mettler Toledo Schweiz GmbH, Grei fensee, Switzerland) and dissolved in approximately 80 ml original rituximab so lution in a volumetric flask (Brand, Germany). tion added to 100.0 ml. D.2 Shear Experiment The shear experiments were performed under a laminar flow bench class 100 with a horizontal air flow (Type B-72- 30, Skan AG, Basel) to avoi d particulate contamination of the tested solution. All parts of the test system as well as all glassware and disposable material in direct contact wit h the test solution wa s cleaned with drinking water, finally rinsed three times with freshl y distilled water and left for drying under the laminar flow bench. In Table D.2.1 these items are listed. Table D.2.1: Materials in direct contact with the test solution Type Part Material made of test system holding recipient borosilicate glass tubing (inner \u00d8 5.0 mm; wall 3.0 mm) silicone filling needle stainless steel AISI 316L rotary piston pumps stainless steel AISI 316L platinum cured silicone tubing (inner \u00d8 3.2 mm; wall 1.6 mm) platinum cured silicone laboratory glassware pipettes (10.0 ml, 20.0 ml, 3.0 ml, 2.0 borosilicate glass pipettes -1000 l blue Treff AG\u00ae polypropylene sample tube 1.5 ml Treff AG\u00ae polypropylene 44 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch The test solution with the model protein was circulated at a defined displacement speed of the piston, which resulted in a pump ing or dosing speed, in the test system. The test system consisted of a holding re cipient and a filling nee dle both connected to the dosing system via silicone tubing as schematically shown in Figure D.2.1 . As dosing systems a peristaltic pump or a rotary piston pump were used. Schematic design of the test system in which the test solution was circulated during shear experiments: (1) Dosing System: Rotary Piston Pump or Peristaltic Pump (2) Silicone Tubing (3) Filling Needle (4) Holding Recipient Figure D.2.1: Schematic design of the test system Description of the test cycles: The defined starting volume of the test solution is exactly introduced with a glass pipette into the holding recipient. As many pumping movements as necessary are applied so that the test soluti on is directly in front of the pump / pump head. The first sample P0 of exactly 1.0 ml was drawn with an Eppendorf micro-pipette 500 \u00b5l in a polypropylene sample tube 1.5 ml (Treff A G, Degersheim, Switzerland). The test solution was then circulated in the test syst em by continuously do sing with the dosing system at a defined speed. After a fixed number of cycles, further samples P1, P2 and P3 were drawn as described above. The volumes of the samples taken were not replaced. One cycle corresponds to the number of stroke s needed to pass the total volume in the system once. In the case of the long term experiment the samples were taken after fixed lapses of time. Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 45 Ursula J. Bausch D.2.1 Dosing System for Rotary Piston Pumps The dosing system for rotary piston pumps consisted of a dos ing machine (Type EDM 3295, Bausch + Stroebel, Germany). The system was equipp ed with one or two valveless rotary piston pumps as dosing units. The adjustment of the dosing volume was made mechanically by fixing the piston stroke with a setting spindle. The position is shown in a digital display. The position for minimal filling volume was chosen 180, fo r the maximal filling volume 300. 180 corresponds to a piston stroke of 18. 0 mm; 300 to 39.0 mm, respectively. The dosing speed was continuously adjust able with a potentiometric control via a turning knob. The values can be set betw een 0.5 up to a maxima l speed of 9.25 indicated according to the position of the turning knob. These values correspond to displacement speeds of the piston between 10 sec/stroke up to 1.8 sec/stroke. The full speed range was covered by the shear test runs. Rotary Piston Pumps: The rotary piston pumps (RPP) used fo r the present shear experiment were valveless and made of stainless steel AISI 316L, as shown in Figure D.2.2 . 4 different sizes of rotary piston pumps (RPP 1-4) of 2 different suppliers were used. The different parameters of the 4 pumps are given in Table D.2.2 . Figure D.2.2: Valveless rotary piston pump consisting of a cylinder (top) and a piston (bottom) (Bausch Advanced Technology Group, 2007) 46 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J.

The friction surface increases with larger dosing volume s and higher strokes within the same size of a rotary piston pump. Figure D.2.3: Layout for the calculation of the generated surfaces of friction Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 47 Ursula J. Bausch Table D.2.3: Calculated surfaces of friction generated surface of friction A is calculated according to Equation D.2.1 : 1B Bx Ax = Equation D.2.1 where Ax is the generated surf ace of friction for a piston stroke of 18 mm (x=2) and a stroke of 39 mm (x=3); Bx is calculated with Equation D.2.2 . Results are listed in Table D.2.4 . hx d Bx piston = Equation D.2.2 where d piston is the diameter of the piston; x (=1, 2 or 3) is the index for respective height and friction surface according to Figure D.2.3 . h1 corresponds to the lowest position of the piston duri ng one stroke. h2 corresponds to h1 + 18 mm and h3 to h1 + 39 mm. Results are displayed in Table D.2.3 . The groove in the piston was neglected for these calculations. Calculation of cumulative friction surface: The cumulative friction surface is the int egrated area of friction over the displacement of the piston. The displacem ent during one stroke has a vertical and a horizontal direction, as the piston makes an upwa rd and downward movement and a rotary movement. The cumulative friction surface was calculated for 1 stroke with a rotary piston pump. The cumulative friction surface serves as a measure for the cumulative area on which the protein solution is subjec ted to shear stress. This is the area during 1 stroke where piston and cylinder are at a distance of the clearance from each other. 48 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J.

Bausch The pump has a speed range of minimal 3 up to maximal 400 rpm. A medium speed of 200 rpm was applied and the pump was used in MemoDose-mode for a controlled dispensing to assure a precise dosing throughout the test runs. The pump has a dosing range of 1 ml up to 50 ml. For the present work a dosing volume of 4.36 ml has been used. The pumphead wa s loaded with a plat inum cured silicone tubing (\u00d8 3.2 mm; wall 1.6 mm) which resulted in a fl ow rate of approximately 200 ml/min considering above mentioned operational speed. D.2.3 Test conditions Each experiment was performed three times with the same parameters. Three types of shear experiments with their corresponding test conditions can be differentiated: (overview of the performed shear tests see chapter G.2) I. Test conditions for shear experiment with: a) a following PCS analysis (rituximab solution) The shear tests were performed wit h RPP size 1-4 and with the WMP.

Total volume in the system: 20.0 ml dosing volume: 180 Pump used: RPP 1 applied pumping speed: 9.25 position of the filling ne edle: above the liquid level Sampling was performed as follows: at 0, 2, 4 cycles Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 51 Ursula J.

Test conditions for long-te rm shear experiment over 3 hours Samples drawn during the Long-term shear test were analyzed by SEC-HPLC to quantify the loss of protein monomers. Total volume in the system: is shown in Table D.2.7 . Table D.2.7: Volumes in the systems used for different pumps Pump Total volume RPP 1 23.0 ml RPP 2 23.0 ml RPP 3 30.0 ml dosing volume: 180 Pump used: RPP 1 - 4 applied pumping speed: 9.0 position of the filling ne edle: above the liquid level Sampling after 0, 60, 120 and 180 min D.3 Analytical Methods D.3.1 Enzyme assay Principle: The enzymatic activity of -galactosidase was determi ned to detect an eventual activity loss after shearing the protein solution. The enzyme assay was performed according to the method of extract chem ie, modified by Amano (Stellmach, 1988). o- nitrophenyl- -D-galactopyranosid abbreviated ON PG is used as a synthetic substrate. -galactosidase splits ONPG into o-nitrophenol (ONP) and galactose. acidic medium, but yellow coloured in alkaline medium can be quantified spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 420 nm and is a measure for the enzyme activity. 52 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch Procedure: The samples taken were diluted 1:10 by diluti ng 30 \u00b5l sample solution to 300 \u00b5l with phosphate buffer solution (17.8 mg/ml disodium hydrogenphosphate (Merck (H\u00e4nseler AG, Herisau, Switzerland); pH 4.5) to obtain a concentration of approximately 0.01 mg/ml -galactosidase. Substrate solution consisting of 0.172 mg/ml ONPG (Flu ka Chemie GmbH, Buchs, Switzerland) in phosphate buffer solution was tempered in a water bath (WB7, Memmert GmbH + Co KG, Schwabach, Germany) at 30\u00b0C. 2100 \u00b5l substrate solution was added to the 300 \u00b5l diluted sample solution in a glass test tube (VWR, Switzerland). Then, the mixture was incuba ted at 30\u00b0C for exactly 10 min. in the water bath. After stopping the reaction by a dding 600 \u00b5l sodium carbonate solution containing 106 mg/ml Na 2CO 3 (Riedel-de H\u00e4en, Seelze, Germany) the absorbance 420 nm with a spectrophotometer (UV mc2, Safas, Monaco) in a 10.00-mm-precision-cell type 100-QS (Hellm a, M\u00fcllheim, Germany) against the blank solution. A blank was prepared in the same way but taking 300 \u00b5l phosphate buffer solution instead of diluted samp le solution. All weighing was done wit h an analytical balance (CP3245, Sartorius, Dietikon, Schweiz). enzyme activity Ac according to Equation D.3.1 . mAAc =10 45 . 43 420 Equation D.3.1 where A 420 is the absorbance at 420 nm, 3 is the to tal volume of the reaction mixture in ml, 4.45 is the absorbance of 1 mol ONP per ml at 420 nm, 10 is the reaction time in min and m is the weight of enzyme in mg per 0.1 ml diluted enzyme solution. One -galactosidase unit is defined as the quantity of enzyme that sets free 1 mol ONP per min under above ment ioned experimental conditions. D.3.2 Selection of analyti cal methods for rituximab As no methods for the determinations of rituximab and the detection of eventual changes of the properties of rituximab afte r being subjected to shear stress in the Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 53 Ursula J. Bausch shear experiment were available, differ ent analytical methods were evaluated for their suitability in a first step. A sele ction of the methods was performed. The selected methods were then developed and optimized further to correspond to the needs of this work. UV-Spectrophotometry: The original solution as delivered and t he sheared solution (30 min.) were analysed spectrophotometrically. A UV-spectr ophotometric scan with a DU530 Beckman spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, USA) was performed. A maximum absorption of the original and the sheared solution, both dilute d 1:20 with distil led water, was detected at 280 nm. No bathochromic or hy psochromic shift of the maximum was seen due to the presence of aggregated pr otein. Therefore UV-spectrophotometry was not a suitable method to evaluate different ly sheared solutions. However, it was confirmed that UV detection at 280 nm c ould possibly be used in combination with a separation method like SEC-H PLC for quantification. SEC-HPLC: The original and a sheared rituximab solu tion were evaluated by size SEC-HPLC. The rituximab monomer peak was detected for both solutions. The chromatograms allowed a quantificati on of the rituximab monomer with the peak area. SEC-HPLC was found to be the method of choice fo r the quantification of rituximab monomer loss. TEM: Transmission electron microscopy is an electron microscopic imaging method. The original and the sheared solution were a nalysed. The original rituximab solution showed with an 11000x magnification a homogenous solution where the single monoclonal antibodies could not be identified. Few undefined particles which could represent oil drops or dust particles c ould as well be detect ed. In the sheared solution unstructured formations of differ ent shape and size coul d be detected. These agglomerations were formed due to the app lication of shear stress and represent protein aggregates. 54 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch TEM was found to be a useful method for t he characterization of rituximab original solution. Furthermore it could be used for the qualitative evaluation of the sheared solution. However, the method was not f ound to be suitable for the evaluation of differently sheared solutions, as a quantitative detection of agglomerations was not feasible. PCS: The mean hydrodynamic diamet er and polydispersity index were determined by PCS to characterize the original and the sh eared solution. The original solution was sheared by pumping with RPP 3 at a minimal speed of 0. 5. The total volume in the system in this pre-run was 43 ml. 100 pi ston strokes were applied; the dosage volume was 300. The results are listed in Table D.3.1 . Table D.3.1: PCS results: pre-run Polydispersity index solution 12.0\u00b10.1 0.091\u00b10.031 sheared solution (100 strokes) 14.0\u00b11.2 0.142\u00b10.079 blank solution not detectable not detectable The blank solution, which had exactly the sa me composition as the original rituximab solution without rituximab did not deliver a detectable signal duri ng PCS analysis. No detectable particles were pres ent in the blank solution. Th is confirmed that the mean hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity index measured in the original solution refer to rituximab protein particles. The hy drodynamic diameter of rituximab in this solution was determined to be 12.0 nm. T he increase of t he mean hydrodynamic diameter in the sheared solution showed that larger particles had been generated during shearing. The increas ed polydispersity index in dicated that the size distribution in the sheared solution had br oadened. However, it was still a narrow distribution. Rituximab was identified with this pre-run as shear-sensitive protein suitable for the following work. Furthermore, PCS was found to be a potential analytical method to detect even slight changes in the composition of sheared solutions. Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 55 Ursula J. Bausch D.3.3 Transmission El ectron Microscopy Principle: Transmission electron microscopy (TE M) is an imaging method where photographs of the sample are obtained indirectly. It wa s used to identify prot ein agglomerations. Procedure: Samples have been used directly or centri fuged at 14000 g. The sample solution was spread on a grid, which h ad a diameter of 3 mm a nd was coated with a 50 nm synthetic film. Particles were stained with uranylacetat before taking the TEM micrograph. D.3.4 Photon Correlation Spectroscopy Principle: PCS was used to detect aggregated protein in the sample solutions. The method delivers with the measured changes of intensities of scattered light a size distribution of the particles in the solu tion as well as the mean hy drodynamic diameter and the polydispersity index, which is a measure for the width of the distribution, see theoretical part C.1.8.2. The me thod is very sensitive to lar ge particles in the solution, which made it suitable to detect protei n aggregates at very low concentrations. Instrumentation: The instrument used for the meas urements was a Zetasizer 1000 HS A (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, United King dom) equipped with an autocorrelator 8 type 7032CN. Data analysis was done with Zeta sizer software Version 1.61 Rev. 1. Measurements were performed at a scattering angle of 90\u00b0 at 633 nm. As light source a Helium-Neon-Laser is integrated in the Zetasizer 1000 HS A. Optimization: In optimization runs the method was improved and adapt ed for the measurement of the original and sheared rituximab soluti on. To pass the qua lity check which is integrated into the system the following measure parameters were established: 56 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch The initial count rate was too low as small particle of a size of approximately 12 nm had to be detected; to ac hieve a count rate betwe en 100 and 200 K counts, the detection aperture 200 was used. The durat ion of a measurement was set to 300 sec. Automatic selection of the attenuator and size range was used. The correlator was configured in parallel mode. Measur ing temperature was set to 25 \u00b0C. The analysis selected for result processing was contin. Further parameters are listed in Table D.3.2 . Table D.3.2: Parameters set for PCS measurements 1.330 refractive Delay between measurements 10 sec Analysis: Weighting quadric Point selection auto Procedure: The samples were measured in a square quar tz cell of uniform wall thickness, which was cleaned between every sample with tap water followed by 3 rinses with freshly distilled water. The distilled water was chec ked for the absence of particles by a PCS measurement before use. O ne final rinse with the samp le solution was performed just before introducing the un diluted sample solution. T he outside of the cell was dried using a paper tissue. Every sa mple was measured in triplicate. Data analysis and interpretation: Characterization of monodisperse samples wa s done by analysis of PI and z average resulting form the cumulants method. Th e mean of the 3 measurements for one sample was taken. The following indication s were respected for the interpretation of PI results: 0.03 - 0.06: monodisperse distribution 0.10 - 0.20: narrow distribution 0.25 - 0.50: broad distribution > 0.50: not evaluable as it concerns a broad distribution of undefined shape. Polydisperse samples, for which the interp retation of the data is considerably more difficult, were characterized by PI and z average from the cumulants analysis. Although, it has to be noted that if the PI is greater than 0.25, the z average size Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 57 Ursula J. Bausch should be used in a relative sense. Additionally, the resu lt from the contin analysis was taken into consideration in terms of mean and width at half peak height and particularly the number of detected peaks. D.3.5 Size-Exclusion HPLC Principle: SEC-HPLC to qu antify loss of rituximab monomers due to the exposed shear during the test runs over 3 hours. The sample is separated by passing the column according to the molecular weight of the proteins in solution. Precipitates were centrifuged to eliminate protein particles with very high molecular weight. The area of the ritu ximab peak in the original solution was set to 100% monomers. The loss of monomers in % was calculated using the area of the rituximab peak. Procedure: Rituximab samples were left at 5-8\u00b0C for 3-5 days so that the prec ipitate could settle and then centrifuged in a centrifuge type 5415C (Eppendorf, Germany) for 30 min at 14000 min-1. The supernatant was transferred into HPLC glass vials (Agilent, USA) and 7.8 cm length; particle size 5 \u00b5m. The mobile phase consisted of 15.6 mg/ml NaH 2PO 4 x 2 H (Fluka Chemie GmbH, Buchs, Switzerland) in double distilled water, pH adjusted to 6. 7, pumped at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The instrument us ed was a Hewlett Packard series 1050 pump (Hewlett Packard, Waldbronn, Germany) and a Hewlett Packard series 1050 auto sampler (Hewlett Packard, Waldbronn, Germ any). The detection wa s performed at a wavelength of 280 nm using a Hewlett Pa ckard series 1050 UV-detector model 79835A (Hewlett Packard, Waldbronn, Germany). D.3.6 Visual Inspection Principle: 58 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch A visual inspection of the sheared solution at the end of each s hear experiment was performed. The aim of this examination was to detect precipitates which formed under the applied shear stress. The turbidity of the solution increa ses with increasing formation of protein aggregates. The storage of the sheared solution at 5-8\u00b0C for several days served to allow eventual precipitation to settle. With this procedure even a very light precipitation could be detected by eye. If precipitates were present, they moved upwards forming a white cloud when shaking t he vial as described below. Procedure: The remaining test solution in the test system was emptied at the end of a shear experiment into a 50 ml glass vial, hydr olytic glass type I and closed with a grey stopper and parafilm. Glass vials and stoppers were the reused primary packaging from the original rituximab solution. The vials and stopper s were washed and finally rinsed with distilled water. The turbidity of the test solution at the end of the shear experiment was visually inspected by comparing the sheared solution with a vial containing the original rituximab solution in front of a dark ba ckground. A second visual inspection was performed after storing the vi al with the sheared solution at refrigerated temperature for 5-7 days. The vial was taken out and left at room tem perature till the solution had adapted to room temperature to avoid formation of condensat e on the external of the vial during the visual inspection. The vi al was then moved with one quick horizontal circular shake. It was verified if an upward moving cloud was detected. A classification of the intensity and size of this cloud was don e into 3 categories according to Table D.3.3 : Table D.3.3: Type and intensity of precipitation for visual inspection Type and intensity of cloud Description fine cloud a very fine upward moving line is observed medium cloud a small to medium sized upward moving cloud can clearly be seen in the middle of the vial large cloud white precipitation can be clear ly seen on the bottom of the vial before shaking.

Bausch EE RREESSUULLTTSS AANNDD DDIISSCCUUSSSSIIOONN E.1 Influence of shear on a -galactosidase solution The suitability of lactase (= -galactosidase) in solution for use as a model protein to examine the impact of shear caused by dosing systems was evaluated. Therefore the lactase solution was circulated in the test system using the rotary piston pump size 1, see section C.2. 20.0 ml of solution was introduc ed into the test system and pumped by applying in total 180 strokes with a dos ing volume of 1.12 ml per stroke at maximum pumping speed. This corresponds to 10 cycles to which the solution was submitted. No signif icant loss of activity was obser ved during the shear experiment. Figure E.1.1 shows the results obtained in a plot of enzyme activity over the number of strokes. 10.0010.5011.0011.5012.0012.50 0 50 100 150 200 stroke sEnzyme Activity (units/mg) RPP size 1 Figure E.1.1: Influence of circulation of a lactase solution on the enzyme activity No physical degradation, which could potentially have been generated by the shear stress caused by RPP 1, was observed by measuring the enzyme activity. Conclusion: As no impact of the exert ed shear on lactase was detected, this enzyme was not suitable for performing the shear experiments for the evaluation of the impact of shear caused by different dosing equipment and dosing par ameters. The absence of loss of activity can be explai ned with the fact that either lactase is not sensitive to Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 61 Ursula J. Bausch shear as caused by the test system used for the present work or by a not sufficient sensitivity of the analytical method. E.2 Characterization of rituximab solution The original rituximab solu tion was analysed. The results of the characterization are presented in this chapter. Table E.2.1: Results of analysis of rituximab original solution Parameter Result UV maximum 280 nm pH 6.52 osmolality 300 mOsm aspect clear, colourless solution; precipitation z average (PCS) \u00b1 0.0 nm polydispersity index (PCS) 0.066 \u00b1 0.008 width at half peak height (PCS) 7.4 \u00b1 1.7 nm mean (PCS) 12.6 \u00b1 0.1 nm % The polydispersity index result from the PCS measurements showed that the original rituximab solution has a strictly mono disperse distributio n with an average hydrodynamic diameter of t he protein monomers of 11.9 nm. The contin analysis of the distribution confirmed these results with a width of the distribution at half peak height of 7.4 nm. The intens ity mean of 12.6 nm, which represents the distribution mean, was found to be a little higher than fr om the cumulants analysis. A percentage of 97.45 rituximab monomers from the SEC-HPLC revealed that approximately 2.5 % protein of higher or lower mo lecular size was present; 0.7 % larger particles and 1.8 % smaller particles. 62 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch Transmission electron microscopy pictures were in agreement to the SEC-HPLC result concerning the presence of larger molecules, whereas smaller molecules were too small to be seen in the pictures ( Figure E.2.1 and Figure E.2.2 ). Figure E.2.1: TEM picture without centrifugation of original rituximab solution The TEM pictures show the presence of larger particles in the ri tuximab solution. For the picture in Figure E.2.2 the particles were concentrat ed by previous centrifugation of the solution. The large unstructured agglomerations probably represent protein aggregates. The black round spots in Figure E.2.1 have eventually been introduced accidentally during preparation of the samp les and are not present in the original solution.

Bausch Figure E.2.2: TEM picture with previous cen trifugation of original rituximab solution E.3 Evaluation of quality of PCS data In this chapter considerations in res pect of the quality of data obtained from PCS measurements are made. The q uality of the data is essential for the estimation how well the analysis algorithms will perform. For the evaluation of the data quality the stability of the count rate from repeat measurements, the repeatability of the z average diameter, the result of the quality factor and the pr ecision of the method was observed. E.3.1 Quality factor For every single measurement the system deliv ers a quality factor. The quality factor was considered for evaluating PCS data. If re sults are within predetermined limits the quality factor obtained is a PASS. If one or more of the limits are exceeded a CHECK message for the parameter which failed is displayed. The limits are listed in Table E.3.1 . 64 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch Table E.3.1: Result quality check criteria Check criteria Check error message Count rate < 10K or > 500K check count rate Merit < 10% or > 99% check merit Polydispersity > 0.7 check poly index Fit error > 0.005 Check fit In Range < 80% check baseline Z average diameter < 1 or > 5000nm check z-average mean range Polydispersity < 0.1 and Fit error >0.01 check fit duration of data used in analysis < 101s check duration In preliminary test runs the PCS measure parameters we re fixed as described in chapter D.3.4 and the exper imental conditions e.g. t he number of cycles with the respective pump were adapted with the aim that the taken samples could fulfil above mentioned quality criteria. Ev ery measurement was check ed for the quality factor. It was found that for nearly al l measurements performed the qu ality factor was a PASS. In a few cases, the samples which were taken at the end of th e shear experiment (sample P3) with RPP 2 and 1, a CHECK param eter was indicated. In these cases the result was examined for the failed quality criterion. The reason for the failure was the presence of large aggregat ed protein particles which on the other hand was the phenomenon to be measured. Therefore even these measurements were accepted. The evaluation of the resulting quality factor indicates that the quality of the data obtained from measuring unstres sed or slightly stressed rituximab solutions is good. Increasing shear gives rise to the formati on of aggregates and to a deterioration of the quality of PCS data. E.3.2 Stability of count rate The count rate of 3 - 5 repeat measuremen ts should be within a few percent of one another (Zetasizer, 2000). Th is parameter was evaluat ed for the measurements of the original solution and for the solutions after cycling in the test system with RPP 1 - 4 with DV 180. The last sample (P3) was analysed. The results are in Table E.3.2 . It was seen that the relative standard devi ation of the count rate for 3 repeat measurements is in the range of 1 - 2% for the original solution and for the solutions Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 65 Ursula J. Bausch circulated with RPP 4 and 3. It was increasi ng when circulated with RPP 2 and 1. As well the count rate itself increased, as aggregation of the pr otein molecules took place. For RPP 1, which was found to stre ss the protein most, the relative standard deviation of the count rate was approximatel y 5.5%. In respect of the count rate the quality of the PCS data obtained was considered to be excellent for the original solution and less stressed solution and was still good for stressed solutions. With increasing formation of aggregat es the data quality was found to decrease, as large particles perturb the measurements. Table E.3.2: Comparison of count rates and rela tive standard deviation of PCS measurements Solution original solution DV 180, speed 9.25, sample P3, RPP 4 DV 180, speed 9.25, sample P3, RPP DV 180, speed 9.25, sample P3, RPP 2 DV 180, speed 9.25, sample P3, the PCS method The precision of the PCS method is giv en by the relative standard deviation SD rel in percent: 100 =MSDSD rel Equation E.3.1 where SD is standard deviation and M is mean value. For the present evaluation 5 determinations of the original solution were performed on the same day and the relative standard dev iation was calculated. The same was performed on 2 further days. The relative standard deviation was ca lculated from the 15 measurement. Furthermore the aver age mean was calculated from the 5 determinations per day and the relative st andard deviation was calculated from the 3 averaged values. 66 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch The same procedure was performed for a solu tion submitted to shear stress with the following conditions. The pump RPP 1 was used with a dosage volu me of 300 (1.12 ml) at a pumping speed 2 (5.7 s/stroke). The total volume was cycled 6 times under these experimental conditions in t he test system described under D.2.1. Precision of the cumulants analysis The results obtained from the PCS anal ysis using the cumulants analysis are presented in Table E.3.3 and Table E.3.4 . Table E.3.3: Precision Cumulants Analysis - z average Solution M \u00b1 SD (nm) SDrel (%) M M SD (nm) SDrel (%) precision on one day (n=5) precision on 3 days (n=15) precision on 3 days (n=3) calculated with the mean of 5 measurements per day original solution 11.9 \u00b1 0.0 0.38 11.9 \u00b1 0.1 0.43 11.9 \u00b1 0.0 0.26 sheared solution 20.6 \u00b1 2.5 12.14 19.7 \u00b1 1.81 9.19 19.8 \u00b1 0.7 3.54 The determination of z average obtained from the cumulants analysis for the original, unsheared solution showed an extr emely low relative standar d deviation below 0.5%, whereas the relative standard deviation fo r the sheared solution was considerably higher at approximately 10% . If the experiment was performed 3 times and the 3 mean values of 5 repeat meas urements were considered to calculate the precision, a relative standard deviation of approximately 4% was obtained. Table E.3.4: Precision Cumulants Analysis - Polydispersity index Solution M (nm) (%) M \u00b1 SD (nm) SDrel (%) Precision precision on one day (n=5) precision on 3 days (n=15) precision on 3 days (n=3) calculated with the mean of 5 measurements per day the determinations of the polydispersity index was approximately the same for the original and t he sheared solution. The relative standard deviation was Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 67 Ursula J. Bausch between 10-20%. The precision on 3 da ys calculated with the mean of 5 determinations was found to be in an acceptable range of 4%. Precision of the contin analysis The precision for the contin analysis was in vestigated for the sheared solution. Unlike the original solution, the sheared soluti on showed a size distri bution with different particle sizes. The mean values of the different peaks and the width at half peak height were considered for the present evaluation. Results are displayed in Table E.3.5 for the mean values and in Table E.3.6 for the width values. Table E.3.5: Precision Contin Analysis - Mean: sheared solution Peak 1 (nm) M \u00b1 SD (nm) Peak 2 (nm) M 853.4 M3-Day2 -- -- -- M3-Day3 11.5 -- -- M4-Day3 11.6 669.2 -- M5-Day3 11.5 Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J.

The relative standard deviation of the mean of 1.8% or 0.5%, depending on the way of calculation, stands for a high precision. The relative standard deviation for the width was found to be a little bit higher at 13.8% or 4.9%. The second and third peak was not detected in every measurement. The second peak was seen in 9 determinations out of 15; the third in 2 out of 15. The mean and width values were calculated from these 9 and 2 available values; the fact that in the other determinat ions the peaks were not detected was not considered for the calculation. The precisi on of the contin analysis was therefore relatively low. However, it still gave a good indication if more than one particle size was present in the solution. It can be concluded that the precision of t he PCS data was very high for the original solution and decreased with the presence of large particles, which were created through the applied shear stress. The method of cumulants worked extremely well for monodisperse samples like the original rituximab solution and delivered still very Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 69 Ursula J. Bausch acceptable results for the sheared solutions in this work. The precision of the contin analysis had to be considered low, but was in the present work in addition to the cumulants analysis a good indicato r for the size distribution. E.3.4 Influence of excipients on PCS data An evaluation of the influence of added excipients to the origi nal rituximab solution on the PCS measurements was performed. Z average was m easured for the original solution and the solutions with added excipients. The obtai ned values were compared. It was found that the z average values of the solutions containing excipients differed from the original rituximab solution in the range of up to 1 nm. This can be explained with a change in viscosity of the solu tion when adding excipients. The viscosity introduced into the Zetasizer so ftware for the original rituximab solution was 0.89 cP; this is the theoretical va lue indicated in the manual for aqueous solutions. Another explanation for the change of the mean hy drodynamic diameter of the protein in solution is the direct influence of the added excipients on the size of the molecule. The hydrodynamic diameter differ s from the diameter of the dry particle because of a layer of solvent molecule s around charged particles or attached surfactant molecules (Weiner, 1984). Excipients may influence this layer. In the case of very small sizes to be measured, whic h was true for the present determinations, these layers add to the diameter (Weiner, 1984). Furthermore, excipients that stabilize proteins against aggregation via the preferential exclusion mechanism drive the protein into a more compact conforma tion. The more compact conformation can lead to a smaller mean hydrodynami c diameter of the molecules. As for the present work the change of the mean hydrody namic diameter with the circulation time in the test system was of higher relevance compared to the absolute value, the following procedure was developed to achieve a starting z average of 12.0 nm \u00b1 0.2 nm for all solutions. A viscosi ty value was empirically established by measuring the solutions and adapting the viscosity val ues till the measured z average showed 12.0 nm \u00b1 0.2 nm. The acquired viscosity values are in Table E.3.7 . These viscosity values were introdu ced into the program when measurements of the respective solu tions were performed. 70 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch Table E.3.7: Viscosity values used for PCS measurements solution 0.95 Tween 80 1.3% 0.95 The quality of the obtained PC S data was not influenced by the added excipients. E.4 Comparison of WMP and RPP The peristaltic pump and the rotary piston pumps were compared in 2 aspects: filling precision and exerted shear st ress on the protein solution. E.4.1 Filling precision The precision for different filling weights was calculated using Equation E.3.1. The WMP, RPP 2 and RPP 3 were compared. 5 consecutiv e dosing operations were performed. Every single dose was immedi ately weighed on an analytical balance (type AG204 Delta Range, Mettler Toledo Schweiz GmbH, Greifensee). Results are shown in Table G.5.1 . It was found that at a filling we ight at approxim ately 5 g, the WMP filling precision was circa 1 %, RPP 3 was circa 0.5 % and RPP 2 showed the best precision of 0.06 %. As expected the precision increased with increasing filling weight, e.g. 0.25 % for a fill weight of 11g with WMP. R PP 2 still showed a very high precision of 0.2 % for a lowe r fill weight around 2 g. E.4.2 Shear stress The results from the shear experimen ts with the WMP and the RPP 3 were compared and are illustra ted in the graphs in Figure E.4.1 and Figure E.4.2 . The test conditions corresponded to th e description in D.2.3 I. Fo r RPP 3 the dosage volume was 180, corresponding to 5.55 ml. The dosage volume used for the WMP of 4.3 ml was approximately in the same range. The speed applied in the shear experiment for Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 71 Ursula J. Bausch RPP 3 corresponded to 9.25 (=1.8 sec/st roke) resulting in a flow rate of approximately 185 ml/ min. The flow rate of the WMP was 200 ml/min. 11.611.812.012.212.412.612.813.0 0 1 0 RPP size 3 WMP Figure E.4.1: Developing of z average with increasing circulation in the test system Figure E.4.1 shows the effect of shear stress caused by the two different dosing systems on the developing of the mean hy drodynamic diameter (z average) of rituximab. In the shear experiment with RPP 3 the mean hydrod ynamic diameter increased with increasing circulat ion of the protein solution in the test system. This was not the case when the WMP was used as dosing system. No effect on the mean hydrodynamic diameter was seen during cycli ng of the test solution with the WMP. 0.0000.0200.0400.0600.0800.1000.1200.1400.1600.180 1 02 03 04 RPP size 3 WMP Figure E.4.2: Developing of PI with in creasing circulation in the test system 72 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch Furthermore, it was observed that as we ll the polydispersity index increased when circulating the rituximab solution with RPP 3. It increased only marginally and not significantly when cycling with the WMP as shown in Figure E.4.2 . Under the shear influence of the RPP 3 a development from a very narrow size distribution with a polydispersity index below 0.1 towards a br oader size distribution could be observed. However, the evaluation of t he visual aspect of the circulated solutions did not show any difference between solutions circulat ed with RPP 3 and WMP. All solutions remained clear without any visible precipit ation throughout the shear experiments. Even the visual inspection after storing the solutions at 5 - 8\u00b0C for 5 - 7 days did not show any precipitation or cloud. The contin analysis method showed a slight in crease of the width fr om 6.3 nm to 8.8 nm at the end of the shear experiment with RPP 3. The size distribution always consisted of one peak. Conclusion: The shear stress which resulted from circulating the protei n solution with the use of RPP 3 generated damage to the protein. This damage resulted in the formation of aggregated protein and could be seen in an increasing z average and a broadening of the size distribution indicated by a ri sing value for the polydispersity index. In comparison the WMP did not cause shear stress on the protein in solution. No damage of the protein in solu tion was indicated by the PCS results. However, the extent of shear and damage caused by RPP 3 was very limited. The polydispersity index after 10 cycles with RPP 3 was still below 0. 1 which accounts for a monodisperse distribution. The contin analy sis of the PCS meas urements, which is good in finding contaminants like larger par ticles, did not show the appearance of a second peak. The width at half peak height gained only by 2.5 nm after 38 cycles. It is known that the selecti on of the appropriate processi ng equipment is a critical point in protein formulation (Wang et al., 2007). Factors which can influence the stability are contact surfaces (Tzannis et al ., 1996) as well as shear stress exerted by the equipment. The reason for the slight increase in z average and PI due to circulation with RPP 3 in com parison to the WMP is suggest ed to lie in the different Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 73 Ursula J. Bausch geometry of the 2 pumps and the different flow of the solution. In the WMP the solution is driven by a peristaltic move ment and the hydrodynamic shear stress can be calculated according to Equa tion C.4.3. In a cylindrical tube the shear stress for a laminar flow is 0 in the centre and maximal towards the inner surface. Evidently this maximum shear stress did not cause aggregati on of the model prot ein. Due to the fact that the tubing had t he same diameter, approximately the same length and the flow rate was in a com parable range for the 2 different pumps used, the hydrodynamic shear stress which occurr ed in the cylindrical tube was in a comparable range as well. Fo r RPP 3 additional shear st ress which might occur in the pump, predominantly origin ating from the rotary and ve rtical movement of the piston has to be considered. It is suggested that the shear stress which occurred in the gap between the cylinder and piston during the movements of the piston led to protein damage. This is in agreement with findings in literature. Maa and Hsu (1996) observed that during shear experiments us ing a concentric-cy linder shear device consisting of two concentri c cylinders, where the inner cylinder can be rotated, a rhGH solution was slightly opalescent and the amount of so luble aggregates increased 2.4 \u00b1 0.3% after 16 hours of shearing. Tirrell and Middleman (1975) studied the effect of shear in a coaxial cylinder viscometer using a urease solution. The rate of urea hydrolysis showed a cont inuous decrease as a function of shear time at a given shear rate. E.5 Comparison of different sizes of RPPs Shear experiments with RPP 1, 2, 3 a nd 4 were performed according to the conditions described in chapter D.2.3 I. The parameters used in the shear experiments for the comparison of the differ ent rotary piston pumps were a DV of 180 and a maximal pumping speed of 9.25. The aim of the comparison was to evaluate if the shear stress on the test solution is dependent on the pump size of the rotary piston pump. Figure E.5.1 shows the influence of circulat ing the solution with RPP 1-4 on the hydrodynamic mean diameter of the protein monomers. As a reference of a pump which was found not to cause any shear stress on the solution, the WMP was added to the graphs in Figure E.5.1 and Figure E.5.2 . 74 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch Whereas RPP 3 and RPP 4 sh owed a minor influence on z average, the smallest pump RPP 1 could clearly be identified to ve ry quickly induce the ge neration of larger particles, i.e. protein aggregat es. A sharp increase of z av erage from originally 12.0 nm to 15.0 nm was observed after circulati ng the solution twice. However, it has to be taken into account that if the polydispersity index is over 0.25, the z average size should only be used in a relative s ense (Zetasizer 1000HS/ 3000HS, 2000). The solution cycled 38 times with RPP 3 and 4 showed in comp arison a slow rise of z average from 11.9 nm up to on ly 12.6 nm and 12.9 nm respectively. The influence of circulating the solution with RPP 2 on hy drodynamic mean diamet er was in-between. Z average showed a moderate rise in respec t to the number of cycles performed. 0.05.010.015.020.025.030.0 0 1 02 03 04 06 CyclesZ 0 RPP size 3 RPP size 4 WMP Figure E.5.1: Developing of z average with increasing circulation in the test system Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 75 Ursula J.

After 2 cycles with R PP 1 the polydispersity index calculated with the cumulants analysis did not show a monodisperse size distribution any more, which was defined for this work to be below 0.1. The polydispersity index exceeded 0.3 already after 2 cycles. The polydispersity index during pumping with RPP 3 and 4 showed that the distribution of the particle size in the sheared solution gradually became broader during circulat ing but passed the limit fo r monomodal distribution of 0.1 only after approximately 10 cycles. The size distribution calculated by the c ontin analysis showed du ring the circulation with RPP 1 a second peak at 20 0 nm or above. It was detected after 4 cycles. In one case the second peak appeared after 2 cycles already. The intensity of the second peak increased with cycling the solution in the test system. Representative examples for the size distributions in the original solution and after 2, 4 and 6 cycles with RPP 1 are shown in Figure G.3.1 to Figure G.3.4 in the annex. The cont in analysis of shear experiments with RPP 3 and 4 did not show a second peak in the size distribution but an increase of the width at half peak height of 2.5 nm and 1.6 nm respectively as shown in Table E.5.1 . RPP 2 occasionally showed the appearance of a second peak after 20 cycles; out of 9 measurement s obtained from performing the shear experiment 3 times with triplicate dete rmination by PCS per sample, a second peak was detected in 5 measurements. 76 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J.

Large particles had been generated d ue to the stress caused by the relevant pump and corresponded to protein aggregates. The mo re the solution was pumped, the more these aggregates dominated the light scatte ring. When pumping with RPP 3 and 4 the size distribution was f ound to stay monomodal; just a slight broadening of the distribution was observed. In terms of shear stress caused by the di fferent pumps, it could be concluded that RPP 1 caused high shear stress which very quickly led to physical degradation of the protein monomers. However, RPP 3 and 4 only marginally affected the protein solution and therefore it coul d be concluded that the stress caused by these 2 pumps was very limited. Pumping with RPP 2 wa s seen to create moderate stress. A clear dependency of the induced stress on the pump si ze could be estab lished: the smaller the pump, the higher the shear stress on the solution. However, for pumps equal to the size of RPP 3 or larger a significant difference was not seen. E.6 Influence of the friction surface In this chapter the relationship between th e friction surface and the exerted degree of stress on the test solution is examined. In the above chapters it was shown that the degree of stress generated by RPPs was differ ent for the different sizes of pumps. The relation of the friction surface and t he dosed volume is one factor which changed with the dimension of a pump. Furthermore, it was assum ed that the stress on the solution was generated in the gap between the cylinder and the pi ston. The size of this gap is the clearance listed in Table D.2.2 . Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 77 Ursula J. Bausch For this evaluation two different approaches were taken into account. First, the friction surface was set equal to the generat ed friction surface A during one stroke. A has been calculated according to Equat ion D.2.1 and result s are listed in Table D.2.4 (chapter D.2.1 ). The calculation of the generated friction surface considered the new contact area between the pi ston and the cylinder at the distance of the clearance, which was generated during one stroke. The generated fr iction surface has then been divided by the dosage in ml to obtain a comparable value for the different sizes of RPPs. The results are shown in Table E.6.1 . The second approach was to take into acco unt the cumulated friction surface FS as calculated in chapter D.2. 1. Results are listed in Table D.2.4 . The cumulative friction surface contained the vertical and the rota ry movement of the piston. It corresponded to the areas under the curve when plotting the friction surface B over the displacement for the vertic al and the rotary movement. The assumption was made that this sum of accumulated friction su rface in the course of one stroke is proportional to the amount of stress exerted on the solution. The cumulated friction surface has then been divided by the dosage in ml to obtai n a comparable value for the different sizes of RPPs. The results are shown in Table E.6.1 . Table E.6.1: Cumulative friction surface FS a nd generated friction surface A in relation to the dosage volume DV Pump size - dosage volume 53973.00 135.7 The relation of the calculated values in Table E.6.1 show that for the generated friction surface the value for RPP 3 is appr oximately one third and the value for RPP 2, half compared to the value for RPP 1. The relation of the values regarding the cumulative friction surface is different. Furthermore the va lues for the same pump for 78 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch dosage volume 180 and 300 calculated from t he cumulative friction surface vary whereas they are approximately the same when calculated fr om the generated friction surface. To evaluate the influence of the friction surf ace a plot with z average over the friction surface instead of the number of cycles was produced. The plots are shown in Figure E.6.1 and 1 RPP size 2 RPP size 3 RPP size 4 Figure E.6.1: Developing of z average in respect to the cumulative friction surface FS 1 RPP size 2 RPP size 3 RPP size 4 Figure E.6.2: Developing of z average in respect to the generated friction surface A Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 79 Ursula J. Bausch The curves for RPP 3 and 4 were practically not inclined. Compared to the plot of z average over the number of cycles shown in Figure E.5.1 , it was found that the curves for RPP 1 and 2 are more gently inclined relative to the progression of RPP 3 and 4. This effect of approach of the curv es when considering the developing of z average over the friction surface was seen to be slightly greater for the plot in Figure E.6.2 (generated friction surface A) than in Figure E.6.1 (cumulative friction surface FS). A correlation of the friction area to which the protein was subjected during the circulation in the test system and the int ensity of stress which caused physical protein degradation could be supposed. However, it was evident that the friction surface could not be the only paramet er on which the intensity of stress was dependent. Further possible factors which could influe nce the intensity and which could explain the comparatively high leve l of protein degradat ion which occurs during the use of RPP 2 and particularly RPP 1 could be t he different clearanc e between piston and cylinder, the different shear speed in the gap due to the different diameter of the piston, or other par ameters which change due to a different ratio in each pump like the flow speed at which the solution is pus hed out or drawn inside the pump. Out of these, the clearance seemed to be the mo st likely one. A detailed experimental evaluation in respect of the influence of the clearance was not performed in the scope of this work. However, in the fo llowing chapters further evaluations were performed. As well, a characteristic pum p parameter was prop osed which considers various factors. Conclusions: The friction surface is sugges ted as a parameter which correlates with quantity of stress on the protein solution during circulation in the test system. As the friction surface was not the only parameter, the influence generally as well as the magnitude of the influence could not be prov en. Furthermore, it was not possible to evaluate which calculation of the friction surf ace, i.e. the cumulative friction surface according to Equation D.2.3 or the generat ed friction surface according to Equation D.2.1, is closer to the rea lity. Considering the results fr om the influence of the dosing volume in connection with t he calculation of the generated friction surface per ml dosed volume, the generated friction surf ace seemed to be more appropriate. 80 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch E.7 Influence of filling speed To evaluate the influence of the filling speed on the magnitude of shear stress caused, shear experiments under varying speeds were compared. In Figure E.7.1 and Figure E.7.2 the results of the cycling at different velocities with RPP 3 and RPP 1 respectively are demonstrated. 0.05.010.015.020.025.0 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 CyclesZ Ave (nm) 10 s / stroke 5.7 s / stroke 4.3 s / stroke 2.7 s / stroke 2.2 s / stroke 1.8 s / stroke Figure E.7.1: RPP 3, DV 180 0.05.010.015.020.025.030.035.0 0123456 CyclesZ Ave (nm) 7 10 s / stroke 5.7 s / stroke 4.3 s / stroke 2.7 s / stroke 1.8 s / stroke Figure E.7.2: RPP 1, DV 300 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 81 Ursula J. Bausch A quicker increase of z average calculated from the cumulants analysis was seen when circulating the solution with RPP 3 at low speeds. However, this was not consistent for all velocities. Exceptions we re the 2 slowest speeds of 10 s/stroke and 5.7 s/stroke. The mean hydrodynamic diameter increased more for the faster velocity of 5.7 s/stroke than that of 10s/stroke. For RPP 1 the results were less consist ent. However, it has to be taken into consideration that circulat ion with RPP 1 generated large protein aggregates after 2 - 4 cycles, yet. It is fact that the presenc e of large particles dominates the light scattering in comparison to light scattered by small particles. The relative standard deviation increased for rising z average val ues. Furthermore the z average value is only valid for monomodal distributions (E isenring, 1994) and should be used in a relative sense if the polydispersity index is higher than 0.25 (Zetasizer 1000HS/3000HS, 2000). Possibl y, protein aggregation occu rred too quickly when RPP 1 was used, so that a difference for the pumping velocities was not detectable with PCS. Conclusion: In Figure E.7.3 the slopes of the trend lines of the curves out of Figure E.7.1 and Figure E.7.2 calculated by employing least square linear regression have been plotted against the pumping velocities. A tendency to steeper slopes with declining velocities was seen. It can be concluded that high er filling speeds were favourable to low filling speed. The tendency can be explai ned with a shorter time of residence in the pump in the gap between cylinder and pist on resulting in less stress on the test solution. However, it was found that there was no major in fluence of the filling speed. The contribution of the filling speed to the overall shear stress caused by a specific pump was minor. The influence of the residence time is in agreement with the calculation of the average shear by Maa and Hsu (1996), which considers the shear rate and the time spent in the shear field. As well, Cha rm and Wong (1970) found that the level of inactivation of enzymes is dependent on the shear rate and the time of exposure. 82 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J.

The solutions in this shear experiment were circulated at the maxi mum pumping speed with RPP 3. The dosage volumes of 300 and 180 were compared with each other. Z average was plotted over the number of cycles and is shown in Figure E.8.1 . The same comparisons were done for solutions circulated with RPP1 at the maximum speed and the minimum speed for the 2 different dosage volume s 180 and 300. The gr aphs are shown in Annex G.4 Figure G.4.1 and Figure G.4.2 . The results from the shear experiments with RPP 3 did not show a difference for the two different dosage volumes. The PI in relation to the number of cycles was coherent with the results of z average measurements. The PI of the starting solution corresponded to a monodisperse distribution. It slightly exceeded 0.1 after 16 cycles and stayed in the range of a narrow distribution till the end of the experiment. This was found for both dosage volumes.

The experim ent at minimum speed showed a slightly quicker increase of z average with increasing circulation for the small dosage volume of 180, corresponding to 0.52 ml compared to DV 300 equivalent to 1.12 ml. This was particularly true for the end of the ex periment after circulating the solution 6 times. However, it can not be neglected that for both dosage volumes the PI of the solution was found to be above 0.25 after 2 cycl es, in which case z average should be used in a relative sense only (Zetasizer 1000HS/3000HS, 2000). After circulating the solution 4 times the PI had exceeded 0.5, which means that aggregates of different sizes were formed. The shear experiment with RPP 1 at maximum speed resulted in a more important rise of z average after 6 cycles of the dosage volume 300. The contrary was found for z average after 4 cycles. The calculation of th e generated surface A in relation to one dosed ml showed that for RPP 1 as well as for RPP 3 these valu es were in the same range for the dosing volumes of 180 and 300. The results of this calculation are listed in Table E.8.1 . On the other hand, the dosage volume was an im portant factor taken into account for the calculation of parameter in form of the number of strokes needed to pass the volume of 1000 ml once with a s pecific RPP at a DV of 180. was suggested in 84 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch chapter E.11 as characteristic pump parameter fo r rotary piston pumps indicating the risk of causing protein damage. Table E.8.1: Generated surface in relation to dosed volume Pump - A/DV (mm2/ml) 203.7 RPP 3 - DV 300 199.5 The influence of the filling volume could not be conclusively evaluated. Within one size of RPP a difference in the amount of stress exerted on the protein solution using different dosage volumes for a fi xed number of cycles in the test system could not be confirmed. At low speed of the piston movement a t endency could be observed that large dosing volume is favorable to small one, i.e. number of strokes performed is relevant. At high speed a clear significant difference between large and small dosing volumes was not seen. No influence of the dosing volume would be coherent to the calculated relation of the generated surface over the dos ed volume in ml. However, this would not be in agreement with the established characte ristic rotary piston pump parameter in chapter E.11. E.9 Influence of exposed air-liquid interface In the present chapter an evaluation of t he influence of the air-liquid interface was performed to verify if prot ein aggregation was induced pr edominantly by the rotary piston pump and not by the accumulation of t he protein at the ai r-liquid interface. A shear experiment was performed by circulat ing the protein solution with the filling needle positioned below the liqu id level, to avoid the formation of new air-liquid interfaces and keep the size of the interf ace constant. The results were compared with the shear experiment using the same parameters with exception to the position of the filling needle. Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 85 Ursula J. Bausch No statistically significant (Student's t-te st, p=0.05) difference of the PCS result in respect to z average values after 40 and 80 piston strokes was ob served. Results are shown in Table E.9.1 . Table E.9.1: Comparison of the developing of z average for 2 different filling needle positions Sample Z average After 0 strokes Mean \u00b1 SD (nm) Z average After 40 strokes Mean \u00b1 SD (nm) Z average After 80 strokes Mean \u00b1 SD (nm) RPP 1, speed 7, DV 300 0.0 15.2 \u00b1 0.2 19.8 \u00b1 0.7 RPP 1, speed 7, DV 300 Needle below liquid level 11.9 \u00b1 0.1 15.4 \u00b1 0.3 18.5 \u00b1 0.8 It was concluded that protein degradation was not significantly influenced by the increasing air-liquid interfacial area. This is also supported by the fact that pumping with the peristaltic pump di d not show an effect on the mean hydrodynamic diameter even though the air-liquid interface renewal during pumping was comparable to that of rotary piston pumps. The exposure to the air-liquid interface during the shear experiments could be excluded as a cause for formation of protein aggregates in this study. In opposition to this result, literature gives a lot of ev idence that physical protein degradation can be caused by the air-liquid interface or by surfaces particularly in combination with shear stress (Tzannis et al ., 1996; Maa et al., 1997; Harrison et al., 1998). Depending on the properties of the protein, it c an be more or less prone to accumulation and degradation at the air- liquid interface. Maa and Hsu (1997) suggested that recombinant human desoxy- ribonuclease was adsorbed less to the air-liquid interface due to lower surface activity and showed therefore a higher stability. Furthermore, it has to be take n into account that a detergent like polysorbate, which was present in the shear ed rituximab solution, is effective in preventing or reducing protein adsorption to interfaces and surfaces and is routinely used in protein formulations (Capelle et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007, Bam et al., 1998). 86 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch E.10 Determination of protein monomer loss To evaluate the extent of protein damage due to shear stre ss caused by rotary piston pumps, shear experiments over 3 hours we re performed according the conditions described in section D.2.3 III. Loss of protein monomers was determined and is shown in Figure E.10.1 . The monomer content decreased linearly with time circulated in the test system. It was found that the monomer content decreased to 97% during 3 hours circulation with RPP 1. When circulat ing the test solution with RPP 2 the monomer content decreased by approximately 0.5%. With RPP 3 an increase of protein monomers over 3 hours was observ ed. The increase of monomer content could be explained with the ev aporation of water during t he 3 hours duration of the shear experiment. When the long term shear experiment was performed the first time an increase of monomer cont ent in the range of 1% was observed for RPP 2 and RPP 3. Therefore the shear experiments were repeated and precautions were taken to reduce evaporation of wa ter during circulation. The system was closed with parafilm. Evaporation could be reduced but not completely eliminated, suggesting that the monomer loss for RPP 2 and 3 was slightly higher. During the course of the shear experimen ts with RPP 1 and 2 the test solution became cloudy and the degr ee of turbidity increased with circulation time due to the formation of protein aggregates. The test solution sheared with RPP 3 stayed clear till the end of the experiment. 94.0095.0096.0097.0098.0099.00100.00101.00102.00 0 50 100 150 200 Circulation Time (min)Monomer Content (%) RPP size 1 RPP size 2 RPP size 3 Figure E.10.1: Determination of ri tuximab monomer loss with SEC-HPLC Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 87 Ursula J. Bausch Conclusion: Protein molecules were not damaged by pum ping with RPP 3 or the quantity of damaged protein was below the detection limit of the method. Circulation of the solution with RPP 1 clearly caused damage to the protein molecules. The applied shear stress caused by pumping induced prot ein aggregation and pr ecipitation. The quantity of damaged protein increased linea rly with pumping time. As well RPP 2 stressed the protein solution in an extent to cause pr otein damage with time, even though the shear stress caused by this pump was lower compared to RPP 1. The results found were consistent with re sults of the PCS measurements in this work. However, the absolute quantity of protein monomer loss has to be regarded with caution. First, the evapor ation of water has to be considered. Second, for the determinations with the SEC-HPLC method it should be taken into account that proteins tend to bind to SEC columns. Gabrielson et al. (2007) found significant antibody losses through the SEC column. A loss of protein monomer due to applied shear stress and subsequent formation of aggregates was found by Maa et al., (1997) fo r rhGH solutions. The rhGH solutions as well became cloudy and turbid with increasing shearing time . Further examples can be found in literature where shear stress led to denaturat ion, e.g. Harrison et al., (1998). E.11 Characteristic rotary piston pump parameter To characterise the potential of a rotary piston pump to cause shear during filling and dosing on a protein in solution which subs equently might lead to protein degradation, agglomeration and precipitatio n, an evaluation to find an applicable characteristic rotary piston pump parameter was perfo rmed. In the present chapter such a parameter is proposed and assessed. The parameter is suggested to be and was obtained by dividing the generated friction surface A in mm2 by the dosage volume DV in ml and by the clearance d between piston and cylinder in mm and by mult iplying it with a factor, that was 88 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch obtained by dividing 1000 ml by the dosa ge volume DV in ml. The formula for is shown in Equation E.11.1. DVml d DVA 1000 1 1000 = Equation E.11.1 The dimension of the suggested characteristic pump parameter is: mm21. For the calculation of the dosage volume and the generated friction area A for dosage 180, which corresponds to a stro ke of 18 mm, was considered. The considered dosage had mainly an influence on the above described factor of: 1000 ml/DV, which describes the ratio between cycl es and strokes for a specific pump at a specific dosage volume. It is the number of strokes needed to circulate 1000 ml once in the test system with a certain pump at a specific dosage volume. The value for A/DV was only marginally in fluenced as the obtained valu es were in a comparable range for a specific pump when calculat ed e.g. with dosage 180 and 300. The values for the generated friction surface A pe r dosage volume DV are displayed in Table E.6.1 . Parameter was calculated for RPP 1 - 4 and is displayed in Table E.11.1 . The lower the value, the less shear stress is exerted by the pump and therefore the lower the risk for a protein to be damaged during the dosing operation. The lowest value was obtained for RPP 4. With decreasing pump size, increased. In principal this complied with the results of the shear ex periment, which showed that the increase of z average and PI with increasin g circulation in the test system was getting more important the smaller the pump size. With exception to RPP 3 and 4, for which the result was less consistent. Although that was smaller for RPP 4 than for RPP 3, the shear experiment did not s how a significant differenc e between the 2 pumps. Even a very slight trend was observed that RP P 3 caused marginally less stress in comparison to RPP 4. An explanation for th is could be that an im pact on the particle size distribution coul d only be observed if exceeded a certain value. If was smaller than this limit, the difference in t he impact of the pumps would be too small to be detected with PCS. This limit for is suggested to be somewhere between 1668.3 mm-2, the value for RPP 3 and 7829.8 mm-2, the value for RPP 2. Furthermore, the Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 89 Ursula J. Bausch values for for RPP 3 and 4 were relatively cl ose to each other and hence, they might be too close to see a difference in the impact on the particle size distribution. Table E.11.1: Calculation of RPP the curves in Figure E.5.1 was normalized by multiplying the cycles with the characterist ic pump parameter . The resulting curves are shown in Figure E.11.1 and for a better resolution in Figure E.11.2 . without the curve for RPP 1. To compare the course of the curves in Figure E.5.1 and Figure E.11.1 graphs with the slopes of the curves in each Figure in relation to the characteristic were plotted and are shown in Figure E.11.3 and Figure E.11.4 . Figure E.11.1 and Figure E.11.2 show that a normalization using the proposed parameter led to curves for the different RPP sizes with comparable slopes. Therefore, it seems that could compensate the differences in the course of the curves of Figure E.5.1 and hence represented well the influencing factors in an adequate proportion leading to the different slopes of the original curves. 0.05.010.015.020.025.030.0 0 200000 400000 600000 1 RPP size 2 RPP size 3 RPP size 4 Figure E.11.1: Curves normalized by multiplication of cycles with 90 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J.

The smaller the gap between them, the more stress was exerted. This relation is also represented by Equation C.4.2., used by Maa and Hsu (1996) to calculate the average shear in a concentric-cylinder device. The average shea r increases with a decreasing gap. The second important factor influencing the amount of stress was the dosage volume. This work suggests that per stroke a spec ific amount of stre ss was exerted. This influencing factor was expr essed in the equation for as the term 1000/DV, the ratio between cycles and strokes. Th erefore, contrary to the results presented in chapter E.8, that no significant influence of the dosage volume on the developing of z average and PI during circulation in the test system at high speed could be demonstrated, smaller dosage volumes would be less favourable, as more strokes are necessary to pass a defined volume. The same is applicable for smaller pump sizes. The third influencing factor is sugges ted to be the friction surface in proportion to the dosed volume. This ratio was seen to be higher and hence, less favourable for smaller pumps. It was found to be independent of t he dosing volume. Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 91 Ursula J.

Bausch E.12 Evaluation of protective effect of excipients The protective effect of excipients was de termined by circulating solutions containing different excipients and combinations of excipients in the te st system using RPP 1 and a pumping speed of 9.25. The mean hy drodynamic diameter and polydispersity index were measured in samples after 0, 2 and 4 cycles. The graph in Figure E.12.1 shows the development of the mean hydrodynam ic diameter of the different solutions compared with the original so lution. An increase of z average was observed for all solutions. The total of 5 solutions with different combinations of excipients stayed below the measured z average of the original solution a fter 4 cycles. The smallest increase of z average after 4 cycles was meas ured for the solution containing 0.5 % PEG 5% Trehalose dihydrate. 1.3% Figure E.12.1: Developing of z average with incr easing circulation of the solutions in the test system The results form the polydispersity i ndex measurements of the unsheared and circulated solutions are summarized in Figure E.12.2 . For the original rituximab solution the lowest polydispersity index was measured. The excipients seemed to influence the polydispersity index of the solu tions before they were circulated in the test system. An explanation for this could be slight impurities of the excipients. The slopes of the linear regressi on line of the curves in Figure E.12.2 were considered to evaluate the influence of the excipients on t he polydispersity index and are shown in Table E.12.1 . It was observed that the unsheared rituximab solution showed the Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 93 Ursula J. Bausch narrowest size distribution with a polydispersity index of 0.057 \u00b1 0.011. After circulation in the test system the solu tion developed the highest value for the polydispersity index of 0.529 \u00b1 0.035. The linear regression line of the solution with 0.5% PEG and 5% Trehalose dihydrate showed the lowe st slope of 0.0737; the starting polydispersity inde x for this solution was m easured to 0.161 \u00b1 0.004 and E.12.2: Developing of the PI with incre asing circulation of the solutions in the test system with RPP 1 Table E.12.1: Slopes of the Polydispersity index curves in Figure E.12.2 solution orig. solution The trend that the combi nation of 0.5 % PEG 6000 and 5% Tr ehalose dihydrate stabilised the protein complies with findings in literature. Xie and Timasheff (1997) showed that trehalose stabilizes ribonucleas e A via preferential exclusion from the protein surface. Bhat and Timasheff (1992) confirmed that polyethylene glycols stabilize proteins by preferential hydration of the protein. Pref erential hydration increases with increasing PEG size. The polyethylene glycols are excluded from the proteins surface due to steric reasons. 94 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch E.13 Comparison of PCS, SEC-HPLC and TEM For the test runs performed with a rituximab model solution, different analytical techniques were employed to evaluate the so lutions after being subjected to shear by circulation in the test system. The analyt ical methods, chosen out of a wide range of available methods, were photon correlati on spectroscopy, size-exclusion chromatography, and transmission electron mi croscopy. The aim of the methods was to qualitatively and quantit atively determine the potent ial damage to the protein caused by a dosing system. The parameter to estimate this damage was chosen to be the formation of aggregates. In the pr esent chapter a comparison of these methods and their suitability for aggr egation analysis is evaluated. PCS was the method which has been predominantly used for this work. By measuring the mean hydrodynam ic diameter z average and the polydispersity index, it was possible to detect with this method even very slight changes in the composition of the solution in terms of present particle sizes. Such slight ch anges were seen for example during the shear ex periments with RPP 3 and RPP 4. Z average increased during circulation with RPP 3 from 11.9 nm to 12.5 nm by only 0.6 nm after 16 cycles. A great advantage for the detection of these minimal changes was the fact that no sample preparation or sample dilution wa s necessary. The samples drawn could be measured directly by introducing them into the measuring quartz cell. Dilution, for example, can lead to dissociation of re versible aggregates (Harn et al., 2007). Furthermore, varying solution conditions like ionic strength, salt type and pH affect protein aggregation (Chi et al., 2003b). T hus, any influence on the aggregation level in the sample during sample preparation or the measurement itself due to changes in solution conditions could be excluded. Particul ate contamination of the sample, which would perturb the PCS measurement, was controlled by applying the precautions described in chapter D.2. However, the PCS method as applied in this work, encountered its limitations when the aggregati on level in the sample increased. Large aggregates, as occurred e.g. during the circul ation with RPP 1, very much perturbed the measurement, as the scattered light was much more intense. Depending on what particle passed the laser beam in the mom ent of measurement, the result for z average and the polydispersity index varied accordingly.

Bausch though the contin analysis displays a size distribution, the concentration of aggregates in the sample could not be determined with this method. Examples of size distributions are shown in chapter G.3. A previous separation by size would be necessary to perform quantification and a determination of size (Demeule et al., 2007). Size-exclusion HPLC was employed with the purpose to determine the amount of aggregation generated by s hear stress from the dosing syst em, as this determination was a limitation of PCS. A shear experim ent with RPP 1 at a pumping speed of 9.25 and a dosing of 300 was perfo rmed to have a comparison of the PCS analysis and SEC-HPLC. Samples were drawn after 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 42 cycles and analysed with SEC-HPLC. Re sults are shown in Figure G.8.1 in the annex. A monomer loss was observed between 0 and 2 cycles, however in the following no further loss was seen up to 42 cycles. The loss of protein monomers after performing 2 cycles does not correspond to a loss due to aggregation. It can be explained with the fact that the sample at 0 cycles co rresponded to the original rituximab solution and the sample taken after 2 cycles was taken from the test system. A dilution effect of the test solution occurred after the first cycle as the test system was not completely dry; some residual water rested after cleaning. When comparing these results with the results from PCS measurements, it was evident that the sensitivity of SEC-HPLC is much lower to det ect aggregation in the test so lution. To obtain a result in respect of a quantification of the lost na tive protein, the circulation in the test system had to be increased. Therefore samples were taken after 60, 120 and 180 min circulation in the test system, whic h corresponds to approximately 45 cycles per hour for RPP 1 at a pumping speed of 9.0, a dosage volume of 0.52 ml and a total volume in the system of 23.0 ml. A loss of protein monomers in this long-term experiment over 3 hours with RPP 1 of 1. 5% (\u00b10.9%) after 60 min., 2.3% (\u00b11.2%) after 120 min. and 3.2% (\u00b11.8%) after 180 min. was ob served. In comparison examples of graphs from PCS measurements of similar test conditions after 0, 2, 4 and 6 cycles are shown in chapter G.3. A loss of protein monomers of 1.5% corresponds to a loss of 0. 15 mg per ml. As 60 min. ci rculating corresponds to approximately 45 cycles, it c an be calculated as a rough estimation that a loss of 0.007 mg protein monomers resulting in protein aggregates per ml was detected qualitatively with PCS in the sample taken after 2 cycles. 96 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were calculated to be 0.03 mg/ml and 0.09 mg/ml respectively for th e SEC-HPLC method. The calculation was performed with the equat ions in chapter G.7 in the annex. TEM was used as a method to visualise the aggregates in the solution. It was used to confirm aggregation in the test solutions. A quantification of ag gregates with TEM was seen to be rather difficult, as a large range of sizes was observed. In Figure E.13.1 and Figure E.13.2 pictures of TEM measurement s of a sheared solution are shown. Figure E.13.1: TEM picture of a sheared rituximab solution Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 97 Ursula J. Bausch Figure E.13.2: TEM picture of a sheared rituximab solution In both pictures particles of the size of a few nm up to a few \u00b5m are seen. Furthermore particles of different density were observed, ranging from clear grey loose agglomerates to almost black more firm aggregates. Compared to the pictures in Figure E.2.1 and Figure E.2.2 of the unsheared solution, it is evident that the number of aggregates increased remarkably. Conclusion: With PCS a very sensitive method to changes due to the formation of protein aggregates in the shared test solution was at disposition. For the determination of the amount of aggregated protein, SEC-HPLC was a suit able method, even though it was found that the sensitiv ity was much lower than for PCS. Additionally, it was found to be a useful complement for the tw o methods, to confirm the formation of aggregates by visualization with TEM. The low sensitivity found for the SEC-HPLC method can be deriv ed from the fact that proteins tend to bind to columns. Gabriels on et al. (2007) examined the aggregation level in a monoclonal antibody formulation using SEC-HPLC, assymetrical flow field flow fractionation and sedimentation velo city and found statistically significant 98 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch (p<0.01) antibody loss thr ough the size exclusion colu mn. Arakawa et al. (2006a) observed that larger aggregat es of monoclonal antibodies tend to stick to SEC columns and the addition of arginine HCl to the mobile phase leads to a higher recovery of the aggregates. Such bindi ng can lead to abnormal chromatograms, protein loss, column damage and an abno rmal separation profile inducing an inaccurate determination of protein mole cular weight data and incorrect analysis of protein interactions (Ejima et al., 2005). Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 99 Ursula J. Bausch 100 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch FF CCOONNCCLLUUSSIIOONNSS F.1 Shear Forces during filling processes In the present study dosing and filling equ ipment was examined in respect to the effect of physical stress which possibly occu rs during filling and dosing processes on protein solutions. A negative effect on protein solutions due to shear stress was confirmed for certain dosing equipment. -galactosidase did not show any loss of activity after having been circulated with a rotary piston pump. Ritux imab aggregated under the physical stress caused by a rotary piston pump. The reason for this coul d be a different sensit ivity of each protein to shear stress due to the difference in pr imary, secondary and tertiary structure which leads to different instabilities. To confirm this, additional experiments with other proteins would be required. Another possible reason could be the different sensitivity of the applied analytical methods in respect to detect aggregation. As well possible is a combination of both proposed causes. Before filling protein solutions the sensitivity to shear should be assessed. The comparison of a peristalt ic pump and 4 different size s of rotary piston pumps showed that the peristaltic pump did not ca use any physical stress. The rotary piston pumps delivered different re sults depending on their size. Rotary piston pump size 2 and particularly size 1 caused aggregation and precipitation of rituximab. Whereas circulating with rotary piston pumps size 3 and 4 did not induce precipitation. A very low level of protein aggregation after ext ended circulation with RPP 3 and 4 in the test system was seen when analysing with photon correlation spectroscopy. However, it should be kept in mind that during a filling operation within the manufacturing of the final dosage form of a pharmaceutical solution the liquid product is not circulated but passes the dosing equ ipment one single time. On the other hand even minimal formation of visible or sub visi ble particles present in the final drug product is unacceptable and leads to low yield and refused batches. Therefore precautions for the filling of shear sensitiv e proteins should be taken in terms of choosing the appropriate dosing equipment. In this respect peristaltic pumps can be Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 101 Ursula J. Bausch considered to be suitable for the filling of these kinds of products. Furthermore no negative effect is expected when using rotary piston pumps of size 3 and 4. Rotary piston pumps size 1 and 2 should be avoided for shear sensitive products. On the basis of the evaluat ed parameters it was demonstrated that apart from the size of the rotary piston pump, the f illing speed had an influence on the aggregation level in the model protein solution. High filling speed was found to be slightly more favourable than slow filling speed. This tendency could be explained with the residence time of the protein in the gap between cylinder and piston. Therefore special attention should be giv en to slow filling speeds dur ing a filling operation when rotary piston pumps are used. These particularly can occur whenever an intervention which imposes a machine stop happens duri ng manufacturing. The last vials before the stop and the first ones after restarting the machine should very critically be monitored and investigated. Machine stops should be as far as possible avoided. The relationship between the friction surf ace and the exerted physical stress during filling with a rotary piston pump could not be definitely clarif ied to allow for an overall conclusion. A contribution to the physical stress is possible but not stringent. Certainly, at least one further factor significantly influenced the extent of physical stress, which has found to be unequal for the different sizes. The clearance between the piston and the cylinder wa s suggested as a factor. Th is would be coherent with the results from the shear experiments. Pump sizes 3 and 4, which have the same clearance, exhibited comparabl e extent of stress, whereas with diminishing clearance the amount of exerted stress, resulting in protein aggregati on, increased. This is as well coherent with the calculati on of the shear rate by Maa et al. (1996) as in chapter B4, which implies that the shear rate and therefore shear st ress and average shear increase by narrowing the gap between cylinde r and piston. Further investigations with identical pumps which differ only in their clearance would be necessary to evidence this implication. The calculation of the fric tion surface was performed as the cumulative friction surface and the generated friction surface. The cumulative friction surface takes into account the complete friction surface which accumulated during one stroke. The generated friction surface was defined as the surface which corresponds to the inner 102 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J. Bausch surface of the cylinder in the height of t he stroke. This was as well the area which was definitely flushed during every stroke with new solution. It did not consider the complete cylinder area which is covered by the piston througho ut the movements. The generated friction surface per ml of dosed solution was characteristic for each pump and independent of the dosing volume. This would be coherent with the results of the shear experiment with di fferent dosing volumes at hi gh filling speed, where a difference for varying dosing volumes withi n the same pump could not be proven. However, it should be noted that the infl uence of the dosing volume could not be conclusively analyzed. At low speed of the piston movement a tendency could be observed that large dosing volume is favo rable to small, i.e. number of strokes performed is relevant. At high speed a clear significant difference between large and small dosing volumes was not seen. A characteristic rotary piston pump parameter was suggested, which indicates the potential of the respective RPP to cause damage to a pr otein due to the exerted shear stress during filling. Apart from the 2 above mentioned factors, the clearance between cylinder and piston and the generated friction surf ace per ml, a third factor, the ratio between cycle and stroke, was tak en into account in the equation used for the calculation of . This suggested a thir d important influencing fa ctor to the amount of stress caused by a RPP, which is the dosing volume. It was assumed that every pumping stroke causes a certain amount of stress, independent of RPP size and dosing volume. This implied that smaller dosing volumes are less favorable as the stress per dosed ml is higher than for lar ge dosing volumes. It was found that the calculated values for represented well the potentia l to cause damage for the different pump sizes and therefore seem ed to be an adequate characteristic pump parameter for RPPs. With different combinations of excipients, which were added to the original rituximab solution, the aggregation level caused by ro tary piston pump 1 wa s slightly reduced. The combination of 0.5% polyethylene glyc ol 6000 and 5% trehalose dihydrate was the most effective protection. Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions 103 Ursula J. Bausch F.2 Suitability of analytical methods for the evaluation of shear sensitivity Photon correlation spectroscopy was predomi nantly used for the present work. It was found that it represents a very sensitive method to detect changes in the particle size distribution of the rituximab solution after circulating it in the test system. It was calculated that 0.007 mg aggreg ated protein per ml could be detected, whereas the limit of detection for the SEC-HPLC method was found to be 0.03 mg/ml. Even very slight changes in the solution were det ected with PCS as for example the changes caused by circulating the solution with RPP 3. These changes were not detectable with SEC-HPLC. SEC-HPLC was used to quantify the aggr egated protein. The loss of protein monomers was determined. A direct quant ification of aggrega tes with SEC-HPLC was not chosen, as in some of the shear ed solutions aggregated protein precipitated and the solution became turbid. To avoi d that precipitated protein entered the column, the solutions were stored and centrifuged before SEC-HPLC analysis. Furthermore, SEC-HPLC is often put into question due to the fact that proteins, particularly in the form of soluble aggregates, tend to bind non-specifically to columns and are therefore lost for quantification (Stulik et al., 2003). Transmission electron microscopy was found to be suitable imaging method to prove that changes in the particle size distribution detected with PCS came from the formation of protein aggregates. A quantific ation of the aggregates was not possible with this method. 104 Impact of Filling Processes on Protein Solutions Ursula J.
