They also have many healing properties. At Houston County Chiropractic in Dothan, AL, we believe that using them will improve the quality of your life by bringing wellness into it. Essential Oils and Wellness The many parts of a plant are pressed or steamed in order to create essential oils. They are often included in therapy sessions. The use of aromatherapy has been proven to affect a patient's emotional wellness and physical health. When applied by our specialists during a treatment, essential oils are known to have a calming effect on muscles that have grown tight. Safe Uses for Essential Oils There are a few ways that these oils can be used safely. While one is as aromatherapy accessories, others include body oil and an aroma stick. Of the three, body oils may be the most commonly used. This is what our specialists often use to soothe an aching body. Each kind of body oil is made up of several essential oils, and each has a carrier oil. The most commonly used are coconut, olive, and jojoba. The Most Effective Essential Oils Some of the most effective oils that have healing properties include lavender, tea tree, peppermint, and lemon. Lavender oils are often used as a sleep aid because they can ease both anxiety and stress. Tea tree oil has long been used to heal minor wounds. Today, most people use it for insect bites, acne, and athlete's foot. However, it is also known to strengthen the immune system. As a topical treatment, peppermint oil can be effective in getting rid of a tension headache. In capsule form, it can treat IBS. Last but not least, lemon oil can perk you up and improve your mood. Surviving the Winter Months In many ways, these oils are the key to maintaining good health during the coldest months of the year. Many of them have antimicrobial and antiviral properties, two elements that help the body fight off a cold. Oils that can work to treat a cold include eucalyptus, mint, and pine. They work to ease headaches, as well as nasal congestion and sinusitis.
