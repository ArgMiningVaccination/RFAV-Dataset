With nasty bugs going around, it's really important to do everything in our power to avoid getting sick. Here's how you can nip your colds in the bud before they manage to take hold - follow these 7 tips to help you ensure you stay one step ahead and combat colds in just 24 hours. 1. Hydrate! Our need for hydration increases when we're fighting infections, so you'll need to double down on water and comforting cups of herbal tea ( [Guide to Herbal Tea](https://www.healingholidays.com/blog/a-guide-to-herbal-teas-and-their-benefits)). Drink more than you normally would (ideally, more than 8 cups throughout the day) to help your body regenerate disease-fighting lymphatic cells naturally. 2. Drink Bone Broth Bone broth is packed full of nutrients and a whole host of vitamins and minerals to help heal and get you back on your feet. Supercharge your bone broth with garlic for its powerful anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties, chili which acts as a natural decongestant, and turmeric, cinnamon and a dash of fresh ginger can also be added and will help to speed up your recovery. 3. Up your vitamin C This well-known vitamin is extremely helpful when fighting infection, so at the first sign of a cold be sure to increase your intake by eating plenty of berries, citrus fruits, kiwi, papayas, broccoli and red peppers which will help keep you protected. 4. Step outside When it comes to combating a cold, Vitamin D is essential in helping to regulate the immune response. During the colder months, many people become deficient in Vitamin D because they stay inside avoiding the weather but you need to make sure you expose yourself to the sun's UVB rays by going outside for at least 15 minutes per day - even if it's chilly. 5. Stock up on zinc Try to incorporate plenty of zinc-rich foods in your diet, including pumpkin seeds, spinach, beef, and cacao. 6. Rest up We all think we are invincible and push forward no matter what but when feeling under the weather but ensure you take some time out - even if it's just in the evenings. Turn off your phone and TV, grab a great book and relax and de-stress. This not only feels good but can also boost your immune system. 7. Fermented foods Think of your gut as a personal bodyguard - 70% of your immune system is in your gut! Keep your gut healthy to keep your immune system healthy. Your gut loves fermented foods like kimchi, miso, kefir, tempeh, and sauerkraut - which are linked to reducing the duration of a cold and may decrease your likelihood of getting sick.
