Schedule your COVID vaccine or booster appointment Bivalent Pfizer vaccine and boosters are available by appointment for established patients in our Primary Care and Pediatric centers. Schedule an appointment using MyChart. Children under age 18 must be Henry Ford Health patients and accompanied by a parent or legal guardian to receive a vaccination at Henry Ford Health. Original, monovalent vaccine no longer given In accordance with the Michigan Department of Health and Humans Services directive, Henry Ford now only administers the bivalent vaccine. The bivalent vaccine is effective against the original coronavirus strain as well as the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 subvariants. If you or your child is set to begin or complete your primary vaccine series - dose 1 or 2 - you will now receive the bivalent vaccine to complete your series, even if the first dose was the monovalent version. If your appointment to receive those doses is scheduled in the next few days, it may need to be rescheduled as we update our electronic ordering systems to reflect the change to bivalent only. - Get the latest updates on COVID-19 [vaccines and boosters](/coronavirus/vaccine-faqs). - Looking for a COVID-19 test?
