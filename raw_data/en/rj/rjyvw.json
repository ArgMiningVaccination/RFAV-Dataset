Updated October 30, 2020 Green-e\u00ae Direct Governing Documents (Supplemental) In addition to the Standards and Governing Documents above, the following supplemental documents are also required for participants in Green-e\u00ae Direct. California Enhanced Community Renewables (ECR) Documents [Green-e ECR Developer and Generator Requirements](../../../docs/energy/ecr/ECR%20Developer%20Requirements.pdf). A detailed list of processes and requirements for developers to follow when participating in the CA ECR Program. [Green-e Energy ECR Utility Requirements](../../../docs/energy/ecr/ECR%20Utility%20Requirements.pdf). A detailed list of processes and requirements for utilities to follow when participating in the CA ECR Program. [Tracking Attestation for Electricity and RECs](https://www.tfaforms.com/4652008). A required Marketing Webinar Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/resourcesolutions/developer-marketing-requirements-and-submission-details-for-californias-enhanced-community-renewables-program). A presentation on \"Developer Marketing Requirements and Submission Details for California's Enhanced Community Renewables Program\" from September 2016. 4. Guidance Documents [Tracking Attestations](../../energy/eligibility). A review of the Tracking Attestation process, beginning with whether renewable energy or renewable energy certificates (RECs) generated from a specific facility meet certain criteria in the Green-e\u00ae Renewable Energy Standard for Canada and the United States, and whether the facility has completed the process to be listed on the \"Approved Tracking Attestations\" page by CRS. [Green-e\u00ae Residual Mix Emissions Rate Tables](../../residual-mix). CRS publishes annual \"Residual Mix\" emissions rates, which are CO2 emissions rates that should be applied to all electricity use that is not associated with a Green-e\u00ae Energy certified product or for which a more specific set of emissions data is not available. These rates are compatible with the World Resources Institute's (WRI's) guidance. [Green-e Energy Summary of WRI Scope 2 Guidance](../../../docs/energy/Scope2Summary.pdf)summarizes the major takeaways from WRI's Scope 2 accounting guidelines as well as required and optional reporting under this guidance. [Standardized PPA Language Providing for Green-e\u00ae Certification](https://www.green-e.org/ppa-language). Buyers who use power purchase agreements (PPAs) as a procurement method may want to plan for future Green-e\u00ae certification of the generation and environmental attributes, including renewable energy certificates (RECs), within the text of the PPA contract. CRS recommends including this PPA contract language to lay the groundwork for Green-e\u00ae certification to come. 5. Attestation Forms for Facilities Within a Tracking System These forms are used to substantiate the chain of custody of all renewable MWh (renewable electricity or standalone RECs) used in Green-e\u00ae Energy certified sales. Renewable energy generators must be registered in an approved tracking system (see \"Approved Tracking Systems\" below). [Tracking Attestation for Electricity and RECs](https://www.tfaforms.com/4652008), to be signed by generators selling renewables through an approved electronic Tracking System and want to be pre-screened for Green-e\u00ae Energy eligibility. 6. Attestation Forms for Facilities Not in a Tracking System Attestations for sales of RECs and renewable electricity from facilities not registered in an Electronic Tracking System. These do not grant any specific Green-e\u00ae Energy eligibility status; the ultimate determination of eligibility lies with Green-e\u00ae Energy staff during the annual verification audit. Facilities not in a Tracking System may only use these forms.
