Red Jasper is said to unlock dormant Kundalini energy, especially during meditation. For Meditation: Set an intention or affirmation for your meditation practice. Hold your crystals in the center of your palm facing upward. You may also lie on your back and place your crystals on the appropriate chakra space. Quiet your mind by placing your awareness in your body and repeating your intention or affirmation to yourself. How To Clear & Cleanse: It is important to regularly clear and cleanse your crystals as you include them in your meditation practice. Incense or other forms of cleansing smoke can be used to clear your crystals. All of our crystal kits include a complimentary Palo Santo incense stick, sustainably sourced by our friends at One Love Holistics. Place your crystals in the Lightwork & Co. satchel included in this kit and run your crystals through incense smoke for up to 60 seconds. We also recommend using a selenite bowl or charging plate and placing in a window which will clear and charge your crystals simultaneously. How to Charge: Use sunlight or moonlight to charge your cleansed crystals. Place them in a location with direct sun or moon access such as an unobstructed windowsill. You may also place your crystals on soil for a grounding Earth energy charge (if you don't have an outdoor space, you may place crystals in the pot of a healthy houseplant). Please Note: Some crystals (such as amethyst, citrine, smoky or rose quartz) may loose color or fade due to prolonged sun exposure. Be sure to cover your crystals while sun charging (you may use the satchel included in this kit). Exposing your crystal for 24 hours to both sunlight and moonlight is ideal and can generate the most energy. Full moons are optimal energy sources for your crystals especially for manifestation work.
