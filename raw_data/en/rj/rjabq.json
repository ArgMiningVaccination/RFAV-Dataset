The fact that these vaccines help in developing antibodies to fight off the autoimmune infection has made these a life-saver. Healthcare workers, frontline workers, elderly people and those with comorbidities are prioritized for the vaccine. However, there is one aspect that is forgotten in between which is taking medicines along with the vaccine. For the uninitiated, mixing drugs can harm the body and cause health complications. Doctors always ask about any ongoing medicinal course before prescribing medicines. Those who take regular medications for different health issues should know whether they can continue taking them after getting the vaccine shot or not. This article is a guide for you. Is taking medicines after the COVID-19 vaccine safe? As per Dr. DN Jha, Senior Consultant- MBBS, MD, Internal Medicine at Batra Hospital, New Delhi, regular medicines for comorbidities and coronavirus vaccine shot, both are equally important for your health and body. You cannot miss out on the regular medicine dose to manage the existing condition and covid-19 vaccination is a must to protect oneself from the deathly virus attack. No one has cared if both can be merged or if there any side-effect when these drugs meet in the body. It is very important to know this to potentially ward off the unforeseen casualty that may arise in the future. Besides, people with comorbidities have a compromised immune system that increases the risk of infection in them. This is why they need to get vaccinated but if they are taking medications, it is better to speak to a doctor before taking the jab. Coronavirus is an autoimmune disease and its vaccine is made to generate an autoimmune response to fight the virus if it enters the body. However, vaccination may act slower in their bodies due to poor immunity and this can cause a delayed vaccine response.
