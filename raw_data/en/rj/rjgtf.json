[] BENGALURU : On 10 October 2022, Karnataka's department of health and family welfare sent an odd circular to all of its district health officers. The circular, written in Kannada, spoke about the stock-out of a vaccine against the Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), a deadly disease that stalks mainly forest and agricultural workers. In light of this stock-out, no vaccine would be available for the upcoming November-May disease season of KFD, the circular said. And so, the health department asked the officers to control this tick-borne disease through other measures, such as educating people on how to avoid tick bites. "}
