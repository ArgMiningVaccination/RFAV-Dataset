As you read through these pages you will see the tremendous impact members of our department continue to make in advancing the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute mission, vision, and values. In 2022, we began emerging from the pandemic while responding to continued growth in patient volume. We opened Dana-Farber Brigham Cancer Center - Foxborough, expanded Dana-Farber Brigham Cancer Center in clinical affiliation with South Shore Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute - Chestnut Hill, and reconfigured the Yawkey Center for Cancer Care to accommodate current and future growth. This work has been grounded in our commitment to safe, high-quality patient care, interdisciplinary teamwork, and our commitment to relationship-based care - a model that has long distinguished us as leaders amongst our peers. During this past year, we also collaborated with colleagues across the Institute to ensure that Dana-Farber continues to be an inclusive place where employees, patients, and caregivers from all backgrounds feel welcomed and supported. Through the generous philanthropy of trustee Phillip T . Gross and his family, we were able to expand our newly licensed nurse residency program to attract nurses from diverse backgrounds with interest in careers in oncology. We also launched a tuition scholarship and mentoring program for our clinical assistants who are pursuing nursing careers. Our commitment to ensuring a pipeline for the future of oncology nursing is being realized as we recruit, train, and retain new staff. In Patient Care Services, we were finally able to welcome our beloved volunteers back on campus. They are an important support system to staff and make a positive impact on the patient experience. We also moved our resources online, enabling patients and caregivers to access our materials wherever and whenever they need support. We expanded medical interpreting and translation services and continue to Nursing and Patient Care Services 2022 Annual Report Contents 4-11 Providing Excellent Patient Care 12-15 Advancing Practice and Research 16-17 Disseminating Our Work 18-21 Developing and Recognizing Our Team 22-31 Accomplishments This annual report reflects Nursing and Patient Care Services activities through December 2022.

Grounded in the principles of the synergy model for patient care, (Curley, MA, 2007), the PPM illustrates nursing's alignment with the organization's mission and values. Patients receiving care in our infusion practices and Radiation Oncology are assigned a primary nurse at the beginning of treatment. The primary nurse works in a small team, and any team member can care for the patient when the primary nurse is unavailable. Nurses in all practice settings assure their patients' care, treatment plan, knowledge of the plans, and continuum of care needs are addressed consistently and holistically.

Nursing has been integral to Dana-Farber's clinical practice since founder Sidney Farber, MD, developed his \"total patient care\" model for the cancer center's 1947 opening. Today, in addition to providing care and symptom management throughout treatment, NPCS staff are conducting original research, addressing cancer disparities, and helping patients navigate the hidden burdens of cancer. They are nurses, nurse practitioners, nurse scientists, clinical assistants, respiratory therapists, nutritionists, navigators, interpreters, resource specialists, and administrative staff and leaders, each committed to making Dana-Farber a safe and welcoming place for patients, caregivers, and colleagues from all backgrounds. \"Relationship-based care is the foundation of our practice,\" says Anne Gross, PhD, RN, FAAN, senior vice president for Patient Care Services and chief nursing officer. \"The patient comes to us as a whole human being, and we strive to understand the person in front of us as someone much greater than the disease that they have.\" During its first 20 years, Dana-Farber ascribed to a primary nursing mode in which one nurse was chiefly responsible for the total care of each patient. Surviorship rates were much lower, and almost all children cared for by Farber and his staff were regularly hospitalized, so being known by their nurses was very comforting to their patients and caregivers. By the '70s and '80s with Dana-Farber now also treating adults, advances including combination chemotherapy and stem cell transplants allowed individuals with cancer to live longer Seventy-Five Y ears of Nursing and Patient Care Services at Dana-Farber and receive more outpatient care. When patient safety came to the forefront in the late 90's, Dana-Farber became a national leader in the movement - with nurses at the center of the changes. Many safety improvements were developed by staff working side-by-side with patients and caregivers - a group that would become the Patient and Family Advisory Councils. NPCS staff are continuing to meet the challenges people with cancer face today in various roles and team collaborations. When patients face challenges that go beyond their cancer - including lacking transportation to and from treatment, nearby housing, and financial hardships due to leaving a job or other factors - Patient Care Services (PCS) staff work to access resources through Dana-Farber's donor-supported Patient Assistance Fund. For these reasons and more, the Institute has been awarded Magnet\u00ae status from the American Nurses Credentialing Center four times. Magnet designation recognizes excellence in nursing practice and health care delivery, and is among the highest honors acknowledging excellence in nursing practice in the United States. Just 9.6 percent of hospitals achieve Magnet status, and Dana- Farber was the first cancer center in New England to do so. In 2023, Dana-Farber is unveiling a commemorative wall recognizing the efforts of NPCS staff over the past 75 years.

Active interventions include patient communications highlighting where to find resources, cross-collaboration between oncology nurse navigators and patient care teams amplifying personalized resources, and digitizing materials for patients to access both on and off campus. Ensuring patients and caregivers are knowledgeable about available resources at the right time in their care journey is of the utmost importance. PCS comprises various services and programs as outlined below which provide resources, information, and services that help ensure access to and complement clinical care. The Adult and Pediatric Patient and Family Advisory Councils (PFAC) are adult and pediatric patients and caregivers who volunteer their time, experiences, and expertise. They partner with executive leaders, providers, and staff, to help improve programs, policies, and overall quality of care. The Adult Resource Office supports income-eligible patients with resource needs, such as transportation, non-medical financial assistance, short-term accommodations, and community resources. In 2022, the office added six new staff members across Dana-Farber Brigham Cancer Center-Foxborough, Dana-Farber/New Hampshire Oncology-Hematology, and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute - Chestnut Hill, doubling the size of the team and increasing patient reach. Resource specialists also partner with patient navigators across the Institute to support some of Dana-Farber's most vulnerable patients. The Center for Spiritual Care provides multifaith spiritual care for individuals and groups across the campuses. These include spiritual and emotional support, ethical consultation, as well as assistance with spiritual/religious traditions, sacraments, scripture, prayer, and worship. The Dana-Farber multifaith chapel is a welcoming and inclusive space for prayer and reflection. The Eleanor and Maxwell Blum Patient and Family Resource Center provides online and physical access to educational materials that can be utilized before, during, and after treatment. Interpreter Services offers a variety of language assistance services to patients and caregivers in more than 50 languages in-person, by video, or by phone. The program also supports the translation of written documents for patients. One-to-One, a volunteer program, is a telephone peer support network that matches patients and caregivers with a previously diagnosed patient or caregiver volunteer. These volunteers are trained to provide a listening ear and offer support from the perspective of someone who has had similar experiences. Volunteer Services comprises dedicated volunteers in a variety of roles who create a warm and supportive environment for patients and their caregivers. Services include wayfinding, information-sharing, snack delivery, creating conversation, and more. 1,000 library cards issued on Overdrive 750 resources made available to patients and caregivers remotely 1,000 patients attended live virtual Zoom events about spirituality and cancer, survivorship, managing your finances, insomnia, and more 6,900 views of 31 recorded events featured on YouTube 2,000 Dana-Farber Brigham Cancer Center - Foxborough patient reminder and feedback calls made 120 volunteers 310 requests for support More than 77,000 interpretation sessions provided More than 350 translations provided Frequently requested languages other than English include Arabic, Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish Longwood resource specialists 6Evidence-Based Practice and Innovation Committee Highlights 2.) Dana-Farber/New Hampshire Oncology-Hematology Studies the Use of Weighted Blankets for Chemotherapy Patients Megan Corbett, MSN, RN, OCN, clincial specialist, Lisa Chicko, MSN- Ed, RN, OCN, staff nurse, Victoria Cole, BSN, RN, staff nurse, and Cheri Hermann, BSN, RN, OCN, staff nurse, presented an EBP idea focused on the use of weighted blankets by chemotherapy patients to the Dana-Farber Evidence and Innovations Committee (EIC). This idea, based on the Vinson, Powers, & Mosesso, (2020) Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing article, \"Weighted blankets; Anxiety Reduction in Adult Patients Receiving Chemotherapy,\" was approved to be conducted at Dana-Farber/New Hampshire Oncology-Hematology by Cynthia Arcieri, MS, APRN, OCN, nurse director, in 2022. The focus of the study aimed to reduce anxiety in patients during their time in the infusion clinic and add to the current evidence that weighted blankets decrease anxiety in the adult oncology patient population undergoing chemotherapy. The group investigated potential products, applied for grant funding to purchase medical-grade weighted blankets, and designed the EBP intervention. Infusion nurses were educated on the use of weighted blankets and completed surveys addressing ease of use during the study. Research found that patients' anxiety was reduced with the use of weighted blankets with the most dramatic reductions seen in the first infusion visit. 100% of nurses reported using weighted blankets as being feasible, and open-ended patient survey feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Results of the project are being shared with organizational and nursing- specific committees with the intention of garnering support for the scalability of the project to other practice settings. Dana-Farber Brigham Cancer Center at Milford Regional Medical Center and the Jimmy Fund Clinic at Dana-Farber's Longwood campus are developing implementation plans to use the blankets in 2023. 1.) Interdisciplinary Dana-Farber T eam Implements T axane Titration Protocol PROVIDING EXCELLENT PATIENT CARE Chemotherapeutic agents often have side effects, including hypersensitivity reactions (HSR). Taxanes are one of the top two classes of chemotherapeutic agents that have the highest HSR rates. A team led by co-investigators Donna-Marie Lynch, MSN, , and Terri Jabaley, PhD, RN, OCN, obtained a grant from Sigma\u00ae to conduct an evidence-based practice (EBP) project to reduce HSRs of taxane infusions. In 2021 an interprofessional including Jennifer Costa, MSN, APRN, PNP-BC, Emmanuele Mazzola, PhD, Jessica BSN, Linzhen Jiang, BSN, RN, OCN, Sandy Monteiro, BSN, RN, Lee Ann Parkinson, BSN, RN, and Cari Ryding, MSN, OCN, NC-BC.The evidence-based project focused on determining the effect of titration on the rate and severity of HSR during patients' first and second doses of treatment, when the risk for reaction is greatest; and to evaluate the feasibility of sustaining the practice pending favorable results. The project results demonstrated a significant reduction in HSR occurrence using titration. In 2022, based on this success, a new taxane titration infusion protocol was implemented on Yawkey 9 and 10. Standard nurse workflows and infusion rates were modified to maintain safety standards for medication error prevention and mitigate hazardous drug exposure risk for staff. Nursing education was developed to support this practice change. The curriculum outlined the results of the project demonstrating the positive effect of titrating taxanes, monitoring for side effects, reminders to use the HSR algorithm if a patient were to react, and the procedure for implementing titration within new workflows. Victoria Cole, BSN, RN, and a patient7 DANA-FARBER.ORG/NPCSDana-Farber's Inpatient Highlights Inpatient Hospital Nurses Mentor New Hires Inpatient Hospital Decreases Noise Enhancing Patient Experiences Lisa Geaudreau, BSN, RN, Erin Issel, BSN, RN, Michele Messina, BSN, RN, and Eulalio Veras, BSN, RN, all staff nurses, are deeply committed to their roles and team at Dana-Farber's Inpatient Hospital. As members of the overnight team, they are integral members of a patient's stay, ensuring exemplary patient care and improving patient outcomes. Approximately 20 newly licensed nurses have joined the overnight team since 2021, and Veras, Geaudreau, Messina, and Issel, have been instrumental in their mentoring with a heavy emphasis on Dana-Farber's patient-centered care model.\"Starting your nursing career in oncology can be daunting and knowing that you have the support of your colleagues makes such a difference in the kind of nurse you will become,\" says Susan Ayers, MSN, RN, OCN, nurse director, Dana-Farber's Inpatient Hospital. \"Working the night shift poses unique challenges, and this group has ensured the best patient care is delivered while supporting their colleagues. They ensure the care and comfort of our patients, and A continued priority of Dana-Farber's Inpatient Hospital is to decrease noise levels on the floors. As part of a Clinical Process Improvement Leadership Program project, Lauren Marolda, MSN, RN, OCN, clinical specialist, and Lisa Geaudreau, BSN, RN, staff nurse, surveyed patients to learn about their experience with noise related to quality and quantity of sleep and staff to determine what they thought impacted patient sleep. Dana-Farber's Inpatient Hospital aimed to increase the percentage of patients on the floor who rated the noise level at night as \"low\" from 37.5% to 45%. To achieve this, several changes were made including: staff education and awareness, providing patients with white noise machines, and sleep kits consisting of eye masks and ear plugs. Patients were surveyed to see how useful they felt the white noise machines and sleep kits were in helping them block out the noise at night to get better rest. The team increased the percent of patients rating the noise at night as \"low\" from 37.5% to 45%, which met the project's aim and improved the overall patient experience. \"As a former night nurse and a new mother, I was particularly focused on how important sleep is for our patients,\" says Marolda. \"Quality and quantity of sleep during hospitalization impacts patients' experience of care. This project addressed the need to improve quietness and promote healing for our oncology patients.\" Lisa Hospital staff staff, every night they work.\" \"I'm fortunate to be able to positively impact the experience of newer nurses, helping them find their voices and encouraging them to learn,\" says Veras. \"I was lucky in my career to have had people impact my practice in that way, and Iook forward to continuing their good work.\" Nicole Joseph (left) and Marie Magdala Tinfil-Jeannot8 PROVIDING EXCELLENT PATIENT CARE Chestnut Hill Patients Find Allies at Center for Education and Support Dana-Farber Creates Inclusion Diversity and Equity Interpreter Ambassador RoleThe Center for Education and Support, physically located at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute - Chestnut Hill, serves as a drop-in space to learn more about a diagnosis, find programs of interest, and more. In addition to offering free workshops and computer access, the Center houses a hybrid library and access to the Blum Digital Resouce Center. Visitors can access online and printed resources for all cancers treated at Chestnut Hill, as well as popular topics like nutrition, survivorship, spirituality, and young adult cancers. The library grew out of a challenge. When the Members of Interpreter Services, Social Work, Patient Navigation, the Blum Resource Center, and Patient Programs created the inclusion, diversity, and equity (IDE) interpreter ambassador role to support equal and meaningful access to care and services.This role combines the professional language access talents of a medical interpreter with the welcoming spirit and informational qualities of an ambassador. As a medical interpreter, they interpret, and act as cultural broker and advocate. As an ambassador, they welcome patients to the Institute, wayfind, and provide information and connection to supportive resources. The IDE interpreter ambassador role launched in 2022 as a pilot program supporting adult, Spanish-speaking patients at Longwood. Twenty-two patients have enrolled in the program and report being very satisfied with the support. Members of Patient Care Services and Volunteer Services and Patient Programs Interpreter Services staff pandemic forced the closure of the Blum Resource Center, patients could no longer access available cancer-related books, brochures, videos, and educational materials. Led by Maritza Nassif, MEd, manager of Volunteer Services and Patient Programs, staff moved all of this information online. Patricia Stahl, MEd, director, Volunteer Services and Patient Programs, feels the Chestnut Hill center is a manifestation of the special partnership between Dana-Farber patients and the volunteers who have always stood with them. \"Volunteer Services, and our resource centers, have gone through a unique and challenging time, but the amount of innovation and creativity and passion for what we do and believe in has grown even stronger,\" says Stahl. On-site Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Chestnut Hill: - 50 on-site volunteers weekly More than 3,000 hours of service - Center for Education and Support: 850 visits since April 2022 On-site Longwood: 80 on-site volunteers weekly since August 2022 -More than 3,200 hours of service 40 virtual welcome volunteers - 17,300 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Chestnut Hill patient reminder and feedback calls made 9 DANA-FARBER.ORG/NPCSProviding Personalized Support for Cell Therapies Patients Madeleine Goldstein, adult resource office supervisor, and Caroline Johnson Costa, cell therapies resource specialist, assist patients in dealing with unique barriers to cancer care. \"The goal of the office is to assist our most vulnerable patients - or any patient that is struggling with the financial toxicity around cancer treatment,\" Goldstein explains. \"Although resources are limited, we connect them with as many concrete resources as possible to assist with the cost of travel, short-term accommodations, or any other related costs to help make things more manageable.\" Goldstein says that when she started in 2018 there were only four people on her team. Now, there are 13 specialists across the Dana-Farber campuses. Johnson Costa supports patients being treated with cell therapies including CAR T-cell therapy and stem cell transplant patients. Her role was created to meet the expanding demand of patients at the treatment centers. \"Having ambulatory outpatient transplant clinics at Dana-Farber is incredible,\" says Goldstein. \"But the needs of this patient group are complex. For example, they must stay close to the hospital during and post- treatment for a certain number of days. These costs add up quickly.\" Since Dana-Farber is one of the only facilities in New England to provide these treatments, many patients come from across the country. Nurse navigators and social workers who interact with patients early on can identify which patients might require financial or lodging support and will put them in touch with Johnson Costa. Once connected, Johnson Costa works with patients to identify their housing and financial needs and uses the various partnerships and resources at Dana- Farber's disposal to provide assistance. Johnson Costa stays energized through the relationships she builds with patients. \"You grow really close with many of these patients, and when you are successful in securing grant funding or making their day-to-day even just a little easier, it's really motivating,\" she says.2022 PATIENT AND FAMIL Y ADVISORY COUNCIL BY THE NUMBERS Since their inception in 1998 and 1999, respectively, the Adult PFAC and Pediatric PFAC have served as national models of patient- and family-centered care. In 2022, Pediatric and Adult PFAC participated in several Institute-wide committees supporting quality improvement initiatives and ambulatory services, provided letters of support for research initiatives from the patient/ caregiver perspective, and more.Adult PFAC 73 projects, committees, and activities 19 Adult PFAC members Pediatric PFAC 28 projects, committees, and activities 11 Pediatric PFAC members Mark Pettengill and Meghan Shea Caroline Johnson Costa (left) and Madeleine Goldstein PFAC Highlights10PROVIDING EXCELLENT PATIENT CARE Since January 2012, Dana-Farber's Cancer Care Equity Program (CCEP) has worked to broaden clinical access for historically marginalized groups who are most at risk of delays in cancer diagnosis and treatment and has joined community partners in the pursuit of equitable care across the spectrum of cancer-related disease.Cancer Care Equity Program FOCUS AREAS Cancer Diagnostic Clinics at Federally Qualified Health Centers Clinical Access and Equity Research Across Cancer Care ContinuumCommunity-Focused Patient Navigation at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Prevention DiagnosisPost- TreatmentDetection TreatmentSurvivorship End of Life1 2 3 Members of the Addressing Cancer Care Equity and Systemic Racism planning committee The \"Addressing Cancer Care Equity and Systemic Racism in Healthcare\" educational program and networking forum was designed to educate Dana-Farber staff and those from other Boston-based oncology organizations on ways to provide expert, compassionate, and equitable care while maintaining a focus on communities that have been historically marginalized. The half-day-long event, held in October, was organized by co-leads DNP Integrative Svoboda, BSN, RN, MA, nurse director, CCEP . A team joined the co-leads to bring the event to fruition. Internal and external presenters discussed research related to eliminating heath care disparities, addressing systemic causes of health care inequity, and more. Addressing Cancer Care Equity and Systemic Racism in Healthcare 11 DANA-FARBER.ORG/NPCS Adult Patient Education Program staffThe Adult Patient Education Program expanded in 2022 hiring three new team members, including two health education communications specialists, and a full-time clinical specialist. Other adult and pediatric education highlights include: Printed materials shared with Longwood and regional campuses - 6,410 information packets focused on chemotherapy and immunotherapy distributed to new patients - 4,200 wallet cards focused on immunotherapy and blood transfusions 150+ teaching sheets supporting pediatric patients A new resource, Caregiver Corner, highlights care best practices for patients and caregivers - Includes 17 handouts highlighting four areas of support: Caring for Yourself at Clinic, Caring for Yourself at Home, Creating Time Together, and Finding Resources and Support In order to increase equitable access across the spectrum of cancer-related disease, CCEP offers cancer outreach clinics at federally qualified health centers staffed by a Dana-Farber clinical team including a physician assistant, nurse director, and patient navigator. Primary care physicians refer patients for diagnostic evaluation of suspected cancers, abnormal screening, and long-term follow-up. They may also refer patients with a history of cancer to re-establish their connection with oncology. This work directly supports the NPCS strategic plan, ensuring access and providing competent, expert care to all patients who seek these services. The Jimmy Fund Clinic made several changes in the past three years to enhance the experience of patients, their caregivers, and staff. This transformation includes restructuring the workflow in the clinic, optimizing patient flow, supporting a disease- based nursing model, leveraging technology when applicable, and refining the patient team structure to maximize the distribution of patient care including: Implemented an infusion nurse practitioner model Adjusted the nursing staffing model to create a blood draw staff nurse and a disease-based oncology nurse navigator role \"The oncology nurse navigator is one of the consistent points of contact that patients and their caregivers interact with from the first day they arrive at the Jimmy Fund Clinic until the end of the treatment,\" says Colleen Leonard, MS, RN, CPHON, clinical specialist. \"The role serves as the gatekeeper, a safe place for dialogue with caregivers, and is a critical thinker during times of challenge while ensuring patient and caregiver needs are met. The oncology nurse navigator is crucial in the multidisciplinary team, as they can often provide the missing piece to the puzzle to improve patient care.\" Various Pediatric Oncology staff worked with Dana-Farber Health Systems Improvement team members to make these changes with input from the larger pediatric oncology community, especially frontline nurses.Patient Education Highlights 2022Clinical Services Expand to The Dimock Center in Roxbury, MA Pediatric Patient and Family ProgramsClinical Services Cancer screening and education Diagnostic workups and follow-up care Referrals for second opinions Genetic evaluations Patient navigation Eileen Foley, RN Referral Criteria New, existing, or past cancer diagnosis Benign hematology diagnosis (neutropenia, anemia, clotting disorders, thrombocytopenia) Breast issues (abnormal mammogram studies, lumps, pain or discharge) Worrisome (cancer-related) symptoms without clear cause (lumps, bumps, bruises, weight-loss)12 Established in 2001, The Phyllis F. Cantor Center for Research in Nursing and Patient Care Services conducts and promotes research focused on the patient/ caregiver experience of living with and beyond cancer, emphasizing symptoms, interventions, and outcomes. In alignment with the Institute at large, the primary purpose of research is to reduce the burden of cancer. Nurses and research scientists at the Cantor Center lead interdisciplinary research teams in conducting studies across the cancer care continuum. Areas of focus (as seen below) include symptom science; identifying biological mechanisms that underlie a high symptom burden; improving symptom management strategies; aiding in treatment decision-making; and addressing caregiver needs. Throughout this work, emphasis is placed on multiple determinants of health and ensuring inclusivity, diversity, and equity. The Cantor Center is currently building community partnerships and expanding studies to Dana-Farber regional campuses to better engage underserved populations. Nurses and research scientists at the Cantor Center lead interdisciplinary research teams in conducting studies across the cancer care continuum. \"Nursing as a role is holistic. Caring for the whole person involves considering the interaction between them, their clinician, the health care system, and the larger context of their situation,\" says Rachel Pozzar, PhD, RN, FNP-BC. \"Nurse scientists approach research with that unique perspective.\" Pozzar, who has been at Dana-Farber since 2015, focuses on promoting patient-centered health care for women. She is interested in the human response to illness and treatment. Therapies and preventive measures are important, but there is a person at the center of that treatment. Other nurse scientists in the Cantor Center focus on the biological aspects of cancer. Marilyn Hammer, PhD, RN, FAAN, director of the Cantor Center, conducts research dedicated to understanding the phenotypes and underlying mechanisms that contribute to inter-individual variability in cancer-related symptom experiences. Others, like Tamryn Gray, PhD, RN, MPH, focus on caregiver-patient relationships and disparities in care. She centers her work on the palliative and supportive care needs of family caregivers who are most vulnerable to caregiver burden and poor quality of life.The Phyllis F .

Manan Nayak, PhD, the first non-nurse scientist with the Center, has a background in sociology and focuses her research on healthcare disparities in immigrant populations, health behaviors, and cannabinoid use for symptom management. The sixth annual Research Nurse Symposium titled \"Clinical Research: Lessons Learned Through Storytelling,\" was held in September. The event gave research nurses an opportunity to learn from one another and from the patients and collaborators with whom they work. Professionals from across the U.S. in various healthcare roles shared their work. Presentations focused on the cost of cancer treatment, work with international patients, the pharmacist's perspective on how the COVID-19 pandemic changed clinical trials, and more. \"All of us who work in clinical research have seen so much innovation and growth in our field in the last several years and learned so much throughout our careers,\" said Caryn Caparrotta, BSN, RN, OCN, nurse director for clinical research nursing operations, in kicking off the event. \"This year's agenda reflects a diversity of subjects highlighting the challenges we face and what we've learned.\" The symposium concluded with a session in which Dana-Farber research nurses shared their career paths, the rewards of their job, and how the field is changing. Nicole Hixon, BSN, RN, OCN, clinical research nurse at Dana-Farber Brigham Cancer Center in clinical affiliation with South Shore Hospital, cited the opportunity to work with staff in multiple areas of the facility. \"Research nursing, particularly in a community setting, takes collaboration to a whole new level,\" she said. \"I love the relationships you form with the providers and the trust they have in you over time.\" 446 1,494 25,361292 221 100%new protocol reviews conducted by clinical trials nurses protocol administrative modifications reviewed protocol amendments reviewed in-services conducted research patient visits amount that the research nursing workforce has increased in the past eight yearsSymposium Celebrates Role of Research Nurses who Manage Clinical T rialsNPCS RESEARCH NURSES BY THE NUMBERS 2022 14 In order to become active, clinical trials must pass a series of formal reviews. From nursing to radiation, each department involved in a trial must review protocols (documentation) to ensure safe implementation in the clinical environment. For nursing, this responsibility is managed by the Clinical Trials Nursing Office. \"From a nursing perspective, we determine whether we have the information needed to safely administer the therapy to patients,\" says Kristen Legor, PhD, JD, RN, vice president, Clinical Research Nursing Operations. \"A lot of therapies under investigation are being delivered for the first time. With advancements in research, protocols are becoming more challenging and complex to implement.\" Clinical Trials Nursing staff, Joan Lucca, MSN, Leah Killion, MSN, RN, OCN, and Virginia Dalton, MS, NP , review new protocols or amendments to existing clinical trials and work to ensure items such as how the therapy is administered, what to do if the patient experiences side effects, and the frequency of treatment are clearly defined. Significant time is put into the process of feasibility to establish that the end users (infusion nursing and pharmacy) are equipped to understand, operationalize, and implement the research being done safely and efficiently. These nurses are led by Maura Dacey, MSN, RN, nurse director, research. In 2022, clinical trials nurses helped lead an important initiative with research Clinical T rials Nursing Office ADVANCING PRACTICE AND RESEARCH Clinical Trials Nursing Office staff colleagues to optimize the Dana-Farber Harvard Cancer Center protocol alert page. The alert page enhances patient care by ensuring that clinicians have the most up-to-date information on changes to protocol documents and serves as a critical communication tool to research staff and clinicians who are providing care to patients experiencing a clinical trial. Regional campus research nurses15 DANA-FARBER.ORG/NPCS The nurse director, clinical research regional campuses and affiliates role was created to expand the research portfolio at regional campuses. In this role, Alissa Gentile, MSN, RN, collaborates with leadership to foster connections and work between the campuses, ensuring research offerings at Longwood are also available at other locations.

Topics are selected based on nursing learning needs assessments, staff suggestions, updates or advancements in clinical areas, etc. Programming produced by this program includes the Schwartz Rounds\u00ae, Advanced Practice Provider offerings, Pharmacy/Nursing offerings, Integrative Nursing offerings, Research Nurse offerings, and other special events. Along with 14 nurse planners, several NPCS administrative staff lead this work in the Center for Clinical and Professional Development. The series went virtual in 2020, enabling more staff to attend the various sessions. In 2022, 15 PDS events were held with more than 1,000 attendees Approximately 50 members of NPCS were presenters, content experts, or nurse planners 48 live programs were produced 130.75 Nursing Continuing Professional Development credits were earned 3,088 attendees Pediatric Mock Simulation The Jimmy Fund Clinic created a mock code simulation educational experience to improve staff collaboration and response to an emergency in the clinic. A simulation manikin is used as the patient, and the learning objectives of the curriculum focus on assigning roles and teamwork with Boston Children's Hospital emergency response team to transport as necessary. Post-training, a multidisciplinary debriefing occurs to revisit the learning objectives and identify areas for improvement in real-life scenarios. Training like this provides a safe environment where staff can learn and practice their skills. The clinic plans to offer this monthly and the effort is led by Colleen Leonard, MS, RN, CPHON, clinical specialist, Colleen Gerrity, DNP , RN, manager, Pediatric Services, Ryle, BSN, RN, staff nurse.
