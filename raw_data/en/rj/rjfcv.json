For storage, wrap in paper towels then wrap tightly in a heavy plastic bag from the store and use within one week. Steam greens lightly, add some olive oil and light seasoning such as salt and pepper or garlic for extra punch. Greens from your garden can be easily frozen for winter soups.

Adding greens such as chard, kale and mustard greens to your meals provides needed vitamins such as C, E, K as well as many of the B's. The significance of Vi- tamin K should not be overlooked. One cup of greens a day more than meets the minimum recom- mended intake. And re-cent research provides evidence that this vitamin regulates blood clotting, protects bones from osteo-porosis, and may prevent diabetes. Greens also contain minerals such as iron, cal-cium and potassium and even contain small amounts of Omega 3. They are an excellent source of fiber and do not contain any carbohy- drates. If you like to forage, don't overlook greens from the wild! Spring, and in many cases through the summer, is the ideal time for tasty greens such as wild leeks, garlic mus- tard, chickweed, purslane, tact your doctor: As early detection is the key.

Here are some helpful tips: Keep to the same sleep schedule when your shifts are constant, even on non-work days. Have as much exposure to bright light as possible when you need to be alert, and avoid light exposure in the morning after a night shift. Protect your sleep by eliminating noise and light from your sleep environment (use eye masks and ear plugs). Avoid taking caffeine close to bedtime. Avoid drinking alcohol since it disrupts sleep, even though it may seem to help in falling asleep, initially. If you still have problems, contact your physician, or a Sleep Specialist. http://www.metrohealth.org/body.cfm? id=1857&oTopID=1857 Holiday Budgeting Helps Relieve Stress pay for the purchases the following month. *Get creative with gift giv- ing.

It remains active beyond Oct. 11th ) ~ Denise Hoecker Are you sad a lot? If you are feeling sad nearly every day, all day, for 2 weeks or longer you may want to talk to your doctor about depression. Depression is a common occurrence. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, 1 in 10 adults experience symp- toms each year. Although the reasons are not clear, women are twice as likely to experience depression as men. Depression can be caused by a variety of reasons which include ge- netic and biochemical fac-tors, environmental and other stressors (e.g., ex-periencing a loss, financial difficulties, major life change) and various psy- chological and social fac-tors (e.g., chronic pessimis- tic thinking, low self- esteem, pattern of worry-ing). Besides an overwhelm- ing feeling of sadness, other symptoms of de- pression include: losing interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy, feeling guilty, hopeless or worthless, experiencing changes in appetite and sleep patterns, and having trouble paying attention and making decisions. The good news is that depression is treatable. Recognizing the Signs of a Stroke\u2014Act F.A.S.T. Sometimes the symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify.
