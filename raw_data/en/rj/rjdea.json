As you know, having bariatric surgery can help you lose a signi cant amount of weight, but a successful outcome requires a permanent and life-long commitment to a healthy lifestyle. The goal of weight loss surgery is to provide a \"tool\" to assist you with your weight loss and to decrease the long-term risk of medical complications caused by obesity. It is crucial to adhere to the proper nutrition and exercise program and to receive emotional support. In addition, working closely with your healthcare team will ensure that your weight loss is safe as well as successful. A successful program incorporates the expertise of a multidisciplinary team Our team at the New Jersey Bariatric and Metabolic Institute located at the Barnabas Health Ambulatory Care Center works closely with the Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center bariatric sta and surgeons to provide pre-surgical and post-surgical follow-up. The sta consists of certi ed, health professionals who are experts in their elds and have experience with the health implications of obesity. The Center o ers individualized nutrition, psychotherapy and exercise programs to meet your need. Long-term follow up is available both individually and through support groups. Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center has earned the prestigious designation as a MBS AQIP accredited facility (formerly a Center of Excellence) from the American College of Surgeons Welcome Patient Name Please bring this book with you to all follow-up visits before surgery What's Considerations Before Surgery 2 }One Week Prior To Surgery 4 }Day Prior to Surgery 5 }Night Prior to Surgery 5 }Hospital Care 6 }Understanding Nutrients 8 }Daily Nutrition Requirements 9 }Quick Nutrition And Eating Tips 10 }Diet Progression After Surgery 10 }Choosing a Protein Supplement 15 }Vitamin & Mineral Supplementation 16 }Complaints, Problems and Solutions 17 }Your Bariatric Health Care Team 18 }Support Groups And Resources 20 }Recommended Vitamin Supplements 21 }Smoking Cessation Resources 21 }Testing Your Readiness 22 }Patient Calendar 24 1 Comprehensive Recovery Pathway for Bariatric Surgery Overview of Bariatric Surgeries Sleeve Gastrectomy This procedure generates weight loss solely through gastric restriction (reduced stomach volume). The stomach is restricted by stapling and dividing it vertically and removing more than 85%. This part of the procedure is not reversible. The stomach that remains is shaped like a very slim banana and measures from 1-5 ounces. The nerves to the stomach and the outlet valve (pylorus) remain intact with the idea of preserving the functions of the stomach while drastically reducing the volume.(Procedure description from www.obesityhelp.com) Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass The gastric bypass operation is both a restrictive and malabsorptive procedure. It is designed to limit the amount of food you eat and absorb. This surgery reduces the stomach to the size of an egg. This surgery will change the way food passes through the intestine. Your new stomach can hold only about one (1) ounce of food. Over time, the stomach pouch will stretch to hold approximately 4-6 ounces at a time. The smaller opening recreated between the stomach and small intestine slows the rate of the food emptying from the stomach into the small intestine. This increases the feeling of fullness, therefore, helping you to eat less. Loop Duodenal Switch The Duodenal Switch (DS) combines restrictive and malabsorption components which allow you to achieve and maintain a greater, long-term percentage of excess body weight lost. The restrictive component reduces the capacity of the stomach while maintaining its functionality. The malabsorptive component of the DS procedure rearranges the small intestine to separate the flow of food (red arrow) from the flow of bile and pancreatic juices (green arrow). This inhibits the absorption of calories and some nutrients. Further down the digestive tract, these paths are rejoined; food and digestive juices begin to mix, and limited fat absorption occurs in the common tract as the food continues on its path toward the large intestine.

You may also need to see your primary care physician for a pre-operative medical evaluation. Please check with your insurance to nd out if a referral form is required. o Obtain Laboratory Tests Most surgeons will require updated blood work before surgery. The Bariatric Navigator (973-322-9845) will be available to help you schedule your pre-operative blood work. Ideally, we will try to coordinate the timing of your blood work with other preoperative counseling sessions. o Start Preoperative Exercises and Diet We recommend that patients who are undergoing bariatric surgery start a diet and exercise program that are similar to the one you will be having after the surgery. To ensure your life-long success, The New Jersey Bariatric and Metabolic Institute will be oering you preoperative nutrition, exercise and psychological consults free of charge. The Bariatric Navigator will be coordinating these sessions for you. o Preoperative Education Patients will receive a pre-operative education session before undergoing bariatric surgery. Here are some topics that will be covered: } Preoperative Diet and Exercise Regimen } Breathing Exercises } Preventing Blood Clots After Surgery } Pain Management After Surgery } Tour of the Bariatric Stepdown Unit } Questions and AnswersBehavioral Considerations Before Surgery It is a good idea to start making changes before surgery to help you prepare for your new lifestyle after surgery. It will facilitate better outcomes. We should mention that there is a risk of weight regain after surgery if \"old\" behaviors are not modied and new behaviors are formed. Most weight regain after surgery is related to behavioral issues. 1. Practice eating slowly and chewing your food thoroughly. You must be able to chew food to an applesauce consistency AFTER surgery before swallowing to decrease your risk of pain, nausea and vomiting. Practice this new behavior by: } Using infant utensils or chop sticks. } Cutting food into tiny pieces or take tiny bites (ie pencil eraser-size). } Chew foods 20 times or until they are liquid. 3 Comprehensive Recovery Pathway for Bariatric Surgery 2. Stop eating when you feel comfortably satised. It takes 20 minutes for your brain to realize that your stomach is full. After surgery you may feel pressure in your upper stomach area, this will be your new \"full\" feeling. If it is painful, you probably took one too many bites, or perhaps ate too quickly, or maybe the food was too dry. Practice this behavior by: } Eating slowly to recognize your feeling of fullness. } Savoring each bite, noting its taste, flavor, and texture. } Sitting down and focusing on eating. Avoid activities (ie reading, watching TV) where you can become distracted. 3. Practice sipping beverages slowly. Drinking too quickly, gulping and drinking too much, as well as using a straw may cause pain and discomfort after surgery. At the same time, make sure you are drinking adequate amounts of fluids. You should be taking in 6 to 8 cups per day (48-64 ounces). Avoid alcohol. Alcohol may cause weight gain and result in poor nutrition, since it is high in calories and low in nutrients. } Try a sports top water bottle to slow you down. } Keep fluids with you all day long. 4. Wean o beverages containing caeine, carbonation and sugar. Caeine and carbonation may irritate the stomach and make you uncomfortable as well as provide empty calories. } Choose beverages such as Crystal Light\u00ae, Propel Fitness Water, Fruit 2O \u00ae, Diet caeine- free Snapple\u00ae and Vitamin Water Zero. } If you are having trouble tolerating plain water, try adding a sugar-free flavoring, such as True Lemon/Lime/Orange \u00ae. 5. Read food labels. Begin by identifying the amount of sugar, fat and protein in a particular food. Sugar Foods that are high in sugar can also slow down the rate of weight loss and may even cause weight re-gain. } Avoid high sugar foods such as sweets, candy, fruit drinks and sodas. } Do not eat foods that contain sugar in the rst 3 ingredients on the food label. } Aim for no more than 15 grams of \"sugars\" per serving of food at one sitting. Sugar alcohols Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, and starch hydrolysates may lead to cramping, abdominal pain, excess gas and/or diarrhea. Sugar alcohols are typically found in dietetic foods such as sugar-free candies, cookies, ice cream and chewing gum. Fat } Avoid high fat foods such as snack chips, fried foods, fast food, bacon, sausage, hot dogs, bologna, pepperoni, cream soups, alfredo sauce, donuts, cakes, cookies and pastries . } Choose foods with 3 grams or less of total fat per 100 calories. Select cheeses with 5 grams or less of total fat per ounce. Protein Protein is important for wound healing and immune function. You will need 70-75 grams of protein a day. Protein should be consumed rst at each meal, then vegetables and fruits, then whole grains. } Eat protein with each meal or snack. } 3 ounces of protein = 20 grams (size of checkbook, deck of cards, palm of your hand) } Eat protein foods rst at each meal. Take 2-3 bites of protein followed by a bite of fruit or vegetable. } Choose lean proteins prepared with little or no fat (white meat like chicken, turkey or sh) } Consider moist preparation methods and avoid dry meats. 4 Comprehensive Recovery Pathway for Bariatric Surgery 6. Explore and purchase protein supplements } Look for drinks made with whey protein isolate. Protein drinks made from protein isolate contain no lactose and are absorbed well. Whey protein concentrate contains lactose, which may be an issue after your gastric surgery. Lactaid pills can help with tolerance. } Choose supplements with at least 20 grams of protein per serving. } Mix supplements with skim or 1% milk for an additional 8 grams of protein per serving. } Choose supplements with less than 5 grams of sugar per serving. } Avoid and/or limit products with collagen (not a complete protein) 7. Purchase your vitamin and mineral supplements. Initially, you will need vitamin and mineral supplementation after surgery as you will not be getting enough nutrition from your food intake. Be sure to check with your surgeon's Registered Dietitian for recommendations. Below are general guidelines: Multivitamin (MVI) - Take 2 chewable or multivitamins for the rst 4-6 weeks after surgery then 1 multivitamin a day for a lifetime. MVI come in many forms such as chewable, liquid, capsules and powders. We do not recommend \"gummies.\" Calcium - Look for Calcium Citrate on the label and make sure you're getting 500-600 mg of Calcium Citrate per pill/tablet. Take 500-600 mg two times per day, separated by at least 2 hours (see schedule below). } Must contain Vitamin D (at least 400 IU) and Magnesium to help the calcium be better absorbed. } Suggested timing of supplements: Breakfast 1 multivitamin Lunch 500-600 mgs calcium Dinner 500-600 mgs calcium8. Include physical activity in your daily routine. Exercise is recommended as a life-long habit and is known to improve over-all health, mood and sense of well-being as well as maximize weight loss. Strive for 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity exercise such as walking. Exercise can be split throughout the day - it doesn't need to be done all at the same time. 9. Avoid \"last supper\" eating (that \"last hurrah\" before your surgery). Weight gain, especially a few weeks before your surgery, can increase the size of your liver and may make it harder for your surgeon to get under your liver and to your stomach to perform your weight loss surgery. 10. Consider losing 5 to 10 pounds before your surgery. Weight loss has been shown to decrease the size of your liver and make it easier for your surgeon to perform the surgery. One Week Prior to Surgery o Stop Taking Medications That Increase Bleeding Anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen, aspirin, Motrin, Naproxen, Aleve and Vitamin E, etc, may cause increased bleeding and therefore, need to be stopped at least one week prior to having surgery. You may also want to check with your surgeon about stopping any herbal supplements that you are currently taking. If you are taking a blood thinner, or medications such as Coumadin, Warfarin, and/or Plavix, your doctor will give you special instructions on when to stop taking them.5 Comprehensive Recovery Pathway for Bariatric Surgery o Shopping List You will be on a special diet for the rst few weeks after surgery. It is highly recommended that you do your shopping a week before surgery to make sure that you have everything ready when you go home. Here is a list of the recommended items: } Diet Jell-O (avoid red-colored jello) } Sugar-free beverages (non-carbonated) } Broth (chicken, beef or vegetable) } Decaeinated coee or tea } Protein shakes (please see list of recommended shakes) } Chewable or liquid multivitamins } Chewable with Calcium Citrate } Sugar-free popsicles } Small dishes } Small spoons and forks } Strainer for food } Food processor or Magic bullet } Protein shaker bottle Day Prior to Surgery Find Out Your Arrival Time at Hospital The Day Surgery sta will call you the evening before your surgery to provide you with information on time and location. You may receive the call on Friday evening or Saturday morning if you are scheduled to have surgery on a Monday. If we missed you at home please call 973-322-5130 Monday through Friday until 9:00 pm or from 8:00 am to 12 Noon on Saturday. You will be asked to come to the hospital 2 hours prior to the scheduled surgery to give the nursing sta sucient time to start IVs, prep and answer questions. It is important that you arrive on time to the hospital because sometimes the surgical time is moved up the last minute and your surgery could start earlier. If you are late, it might create a signicant problem with starting your surgery on time. In some cases, lateness could result in moving your surgery to a much later time.Night Prior to Surgery o What Should I Eat or Drink } Check with your surgeon to see what you can eat or drink before surgery. o What to Bring to the Hospital } A copy of your advance directives } Your insurance card, driver's license or photo I.D., and any co-payment required by your insurance company } Your CPAP machine if you have one } Cell phone and charger } List of medications } Loose-tting cover up (bathrobe) } Walking shoe or sturdy slippers } Personal toiletries } Glasses, contacts } Chewing gum o Special Instructions } Check with your primary care physician prior to taking any medication for diabetes on the day of surgery } Please leave jewelry, valuables, and large amounts of money at home } Makeup must be removed before your procedure } Nail polish may be left on, remove nail tip s 6 Comprehensive Recovery Pathway for Bariatric Surgery Hospital Care Registration You are required to arrive 2 hours prior to scheduled time of surgery. Proceed to Registration in the new Cooperman Pavilion entrance of the hospital to register. The sta will be asking for your driver's license or photo I.D., insurance card, and if you have an advance directive (please bring a copy if you have one). After registration, you will be asked to be seated in the waiting area until they call you into the pre-operative area. Pre-operative Area You will be asked to change into a cotton hospital gown. All jewelry should be removed. You will be provided a garment bag where you can put your clothes and shoes which can be kept in the closet and delivered to your room in the afternoon/evening after your surgery. Please do not leave valuables, jewelry and money in the garment bag. Nurses will be checking your blood pressure, temperature, etc. and will verify information obtained from you previously. Please let the sta know the exact time you had anything to eat or drink. They will also insert an intravenous catheter in your arm and start giving you IV fluids. Your IV catheter can also be used for administering medications. Operating Room (O.R.) Holding Area You will be transported to this area via stretcher or bed. This is where you will be waiting while they are getting the operating room ready for your surgery. The nurses will be verifying all your information and are available to answer your questions. If medications are ordered prior to surgery, you will be receiving them here. The anesthesiologist will be seeing you in this area before the surgery.Operating Room (O.R.) When the surgeon and the operating room sta are ready for your procedure, they will take you to the operating room via stretcher or bed. You will then be transferred on to the operating room table where you will be put in the proper position for surgery. The anesthesiologist will then give you medications to make you go to sleep before starting the procedure. Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) After the procedure, you will be transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. Your family members and friends in the waiting room will be given an update by your surgeon. The length of your stay here varies from a half an hour to several hours depending on several factors such as pain level, presence of nausea or vomiting, etc. Pain medications and anti-nausea medications will be available for you. You will have flowtrons boots on your legs that alternately pump to prevent blood clots. 7 Comprehensive Recovery Pathway for Bariatric Surgery Dedicated Post-Surgery Floor Once your vital signs, pain and nausea are stable, you will be moved to your room. You will be transferred in your bed. You will have a pulse oximeter applied on your nger overnight that measures the amount of oxygenation in your blood, and a telemetry monitor will also be applied on your chest to monitor your heart. You will be given an incentive spirometer for your deep breathing exercises. Surgery Center In general, patients who have undergone the sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass will be transferred to Surgery Center after PACU, then to the specic bariatric unit. After Surgery You will be encouraged to use your incentive spirometer for deep breathing exercises and to walk around the nurses' station to help mobilize the gas in your abdomen. You will be provided small, 1-ounce cups to measure your fluid intake. Most patients will be started on bariatric stage I diet (clear liquids) after the surgery. Your nurse will explain the amount of intake that you are allowed to take per hour. Your urine output will also be measured. There will be medications available for your pain, nausea, and vomiting. Nurses are always available to answer your questions. You will be allowed to take a shower on the second day after the surgery. You will also be seen by your surgeon as well as other doctors such as a Metabolic Physician, Endocrinologist, Cardiologist, and Pulmonologist the day after your surgery. You will be weighed prior to discharge. On the morning of your discharge, you will receive discharge education from the Bariatric Team that includes information you need when you go home. 8 Comprehensive Recovery Pathway for Bariatric Surgery Understanding Nutrients Remember, you have just had a major surgery. To help with healing, maintain health and prevent disease, it is crucial to modify key nutrients in your diet. In general, your new diet will be high in protein and low in fat, calories, and sugar. Important vitamins and minerals will be supplemented. Let's review the key nutrients. Protein Protein is the nutrient that the body uses to build new tissue and help with wound healing. This is particularly true after surgery. Adequate protein intake will also help to limit or prevent hair loss following signicant weight loss. Over the long term, protein will help preserve muscle tissue so that weight loss will consist primarily of fat and not muscle. Sources: } lean meats such as skinless chicken, turkey, and veal } sh } egg whites } low-fat or fat-free dairy such as cheese, milk, soy products } protein supplements - see appendix for more detailsFluids One of the main challenges for the post-bariatric patient is to prevent dehydration by consuming adequate fluids. After surgery, fluids must be separated from food. Fluids should not be consumed for 30 minutes prior to eating and for at least 30 to 60 minutes after eating. A minimum of 48-64 ounces of fluid should be consumed per day. A challenge may be drinking enough fluids without feeling full so, sip slowly and avoid using straws or drinking carbonated beverages (increases air pulled into the body causing gas and bloating). Sources: } water } no-calorie beverages } protein drinks count as fluids! Fiber There is initially less space in the stomach to hold bulky, high ber foods and less gastric juices available to digest them. If high ber foods are not chewed thoroughly, they may get stuck in the pouch or block the narrow opening into the small intestine. Wait about 2 months after surgery before introducing high ber foods. Sources: } vegetables } fruits 9 Comprehensive Recovery Pathway for Bariatric Surgery Fat Too much fat in the diet delays emptying of the stomach and lls you up; leaving no room for other nutrients that can better sustain you. In addition, consumption of fat increases the risk of gastric reflux and adds unneeded extra calories. Fat may also cause diarrhea, nausea or stomach discomfort. Sources: } fried foods } fatty meats such as beef, } cream sauces } mayonnaise } butter } margarine } regular cheese } regular salad dressing, oils, etc. High Sugar Food: High sugar foods are high in calories and/or fat. Even in small amounts they can make weight loss dicult. Eating foods high in sugar may promote \"dumping syndrome\" (gastric bypass patients only). Symptoms of dumping syndrome may include: bloating, nausea, uncomfortable fullness, abdominal pain/cramping, diarrhea, weakness, sweating, and fast heart rate. Most sugary foods do not provide many vitamins or minerals despite their calorie content. Since calories are limited on the gastric bypass/gastric banding diet, it is important that every food contribute nutrients. Look for \"sugar free,\" \"no added sugar,\" or \"zero calorie\" products. Although milk or fruit containing items will contain grams of sugar, it is a natural sugar with nutritional value and is acceptable to incorporate as part of a healthy diet.Check the ingredient list on products to avoid: } sugar } high fructose corn syrup } brown sugar } honey } hydrolyzed corn syrup } glucose Articial sweeteners are acceptable: } Splenda (Sucralose) } Sweet N Low (Sacchrin) } Equal, Nutra-Sweet (Aspartame) Natural Sweeteners are acceptable: } Stevia } Truvia Daily Nutrition Requirements The bariatric diet is designed to bring about signicant weight loss. Learning new eating habits and behaviors as well as following the recommended diet will help to maintain long-term weight loss. Since the amount of food you will be able to consume after surgery is limited, your food choices will need to be of high nutritional quality in order to maintain health. In other words you want to get \"the biggest nutritional bang for the calories.\" The following guidelines will ensure that you are consuming a well-balanced, calorie-controlled diet. These guidelines will also help to reduce your risk of side eects and physical discomfort. Daily Nutrition Requirements after Surgery Calories 900-1100 do not expect to reach this daily calorie level for several months after surgery Protein 70-85 grams (food and supplements) Carbohydrates 100 grams (unless advised otherwise by Dietitian)10 Comprehensive Recovery Pathway for Bariatric Surgery Fat limit to 30 grams or less (preferable healthy fats: mono and polyunsaturated fats - ask your Dietitian for this information) Fluid Minimum of 48-64 ounces (water, calorie-free, decaeinated beverages - includes liquid protein supplements) Supplements multi-vitamin, calcium, sublingual B-12, and vitamin D Quick Nutrition and Eating Tips } Chew food thoroughly before swallowing } Eat slowly (30-35 minutes per meal) } Eat protein rst at each meal } Learn proper portion sizes (weigh & measure foods) } Use smaller plates & toddler size utensils-which helps reduce portion size } Use protein shakes to increase daily protein and liquid intake } Sip liquids slowly } No liquids from 30 minutes before and 30 to 60 minutes after food } No fluids with food } Eat 3- 5 nutritious meals everyday (immediately after surgery, smaller, more frequent meals may be more tolerable) } Keep food records to track calories and grams of protein } Take a liquid or chewable multivitamin with iron daily } Take additional 1000-1500mg calcium daily (split dose) } Exercise regularly (consult with your physician for exercise clearance) Your dietitian will go over this information in more detail during you nutrition consultation sessions.Diet Progression After Surgery After surgery, your diet will progress through the different stages. It is important to follow these stages for a smooth, safe recovery. If you are not tolerating a diet stage, contact your doctor as it may be suggested that you return to the previous stage and then advance at your own pace. It is advisable to keep track of any food that causes discomfort and wait two weeks before re-trying that food. One of the most important messages is don't eat until you feel full. The nerves of satiety (feeling of stomach fullness and eating satisfaction) are \"slow\" nerves. There is a delay of about 15 minutes from the time your stomach pouch gets comfortably lled to the time that your brain becomes aware of that fact. If you swallow even one additional bite, the pouch can become overlled and you may experience stomach pain, nausea and possibly vomiting. Realistically, every patient will probably experience this overlled feeling at one time or another. The goal is to learn from the experience. Try to make a mental note of the appropriate amount of food so that you will know when to stop eating, before you feel full. Adjusting to this new concept/eating behavior may take time. In order to ensure that you can be successful in attaining your weight loss goals, it is important to understand situations that can lead to weight regain such as: } Frequent overeating -this may lead to stretching of the pouch. This can be one of the causes of weight regain several years after surgery. It is very important not to overeat after surgery. } Over time, the absorption of calories will improve and as a result you will be absorbing more calories, possibly leading to weight regain. Although this booklet contains food and nutrition guidelines, more individualized information will be discussed with the Dietitian during your nutrition consultations.11 Comprehensive Recovery Pathway for Bariatric Surgery Following Your Surgery... Initially following your surgery, you will be encouraged to sip small amounts of liquids to assess tolerance and begin the healing process. Your specialized diet while in the hospital will consist of: Breakfast - Lunch - Dinner } 2 tablespoons (30 mls) of unsweetened, decaeinated, non-carbonated fluids } Sips of water all day long In general, the following liquids are allowed for the rst week: } Sugar-free gelatin } Broth-chicken, beef or vegetable (the salt in the broth can help your body hold on to fluid better) } Water, decaeinated tea, decaeinated coee } Sugar-free fruit drinks (ie. Crystal } Sugar-free popsicles and sugar-free Italian ice } Unflavored protein supplement can be mixed with Crystal Light \u00ae Progression of Nutritional Stages Please keep in mind that the following information on the progression stages are meant to be general guidelines. In addition, you may receive diet progression information from others. Please check with your surgeon's Registered Dietitian if you have any questions or need more detailed information. Week One After Surgery - Clear Liquids 1. Consume 3 - 5 clear liquid meals a day. You should try to consume at least 3 ounces at each meal. 2.

Consume 3 pureed meals a day plus one 11-15 oz. sugar free protein drink which can be divided up in between your meals. (Note: many ready-to-drink protein drinks are 11-15 oz) 2. Each meal should total 6 tablespoons of pureed food. 3. Eat slowly. Make each meal last 30 minutes. 4. Fluids are no longer consumed with meals. 5. To make your own pureed foods: cook thoroughly and then puree in a blender or food processor until baby food consistency. You may add a little broth, strained soup or low fat gravy to keep food moist during the blending process. 6. Avoid raw fruits and vegetables. 7. Your main focus on each meal is your protein rich foods. Always start with protein rst. 8. Be sure to sip on water and calorie free non-carbonated drinks between meals, throughout the day. Goal is 6 - 8 cups (48 -64 oz.) of fluid a day.Example of pureed food choices: } Soft scrambled eggs } Sugar-free smooth (Light) yogurt or plain yogurt, or plain Greek yogurt } Smooth low-fat cottage cheese } Farina (cream of wheat), cream of rice, oatmeal needs to be runny } Baby food } Low fat, sugar free pudding } Smooth tuna salad, egg salad with low fat mayonnaise } Pureed poultry, sh } Pureed cooked vegetables i.e. carrots, sweet potatoes (NOT STRINGY VEGETABLES) } Tofu } Pureed fruit (canned, in own juice or fresh cooked) REMEMBER: Consume protein first.

Expect to start on a regular diet anywhere from 4-8 weeks after surgery. } Consume 3 meals a day plus 2 protein rich foods. } Each meal should be about 1 cup total or 16 tablespoons. } Take 30 - 45 minutes to consume a meal. This is extremely important! } In the beginning it is recommended to chew your food to an applesauce consistency. As time goes on this will ease up. Thorough chewing will always be the key to success. } If solid foods are not tolerated well, go back to pureed foods. Be sure to continue with a cup of food even though you may be on pureed foods. Retry solid foods in a few days } Try to consume 2-3 oz. protein (14-21 grams protein) at each meal. Your daily goal is 70 - 75 grams a day. Refer to your protein list in this pamphlet. } When eating a meal, always consume your protein rich food rst. } Eat a variety of foods and make sensible choices. Try not to get in the habit of eating the same foods all the time. } Your taste for some favorite foods may change in the beginning.

The Metabolic Physician is an Internal Medicine specialist with advanced training and certication in clinical nutrition; they are experts in obesity management. These physicians will: } adjust any medications } perform metabolic monitoring and } assure that you are employing proper strategies for a successful outcome. Medication Adjustments may be required due to pill size/format and your recent surgery. Based on you medical history, additional medications such as acid blockers or anticoagulants may be recommended. Bariatric surgery patients are often able to decrease or discontinue many medications; however sudden discontinuation of certain medications can be dangerous. On the other hand, continuing drugs when they are unnecessary can lead to serious side eects. The metabolic physician will guide you through this process. Metabolic Monitoring protects patients from developing deciencies of vital nutrients such as protein, electrolytes, vitamins and minerals. Hair loss, dry skin, dry eyes, altered taste, and numbness may be signs of early nutrient deciency. More serious conditions including visual disturbance, osteoporosis and cardiac dysfunction can occur if nutritional deciencies are not properly corrected. Regular blood tests and clinical examinations are scheduled to prevent post operative deciencies.

Bariatric surgery alone does not change long-standing food behaviors. Weight loss surgery requires lifelong nutritional management. It is important to nd a registered dietitian that specializes in bariatric patients. Your Registered Dietitian can help ensure that the patient is eating the proper amount of calories and protein, while 19 Comprehensive Recovery Pathway for Bariatric Surgery still obtaining all vital nutrients. They will work with the patient on making appropriate food choices, brand selection, and supplements. Individualized meal plans also allow your new way of eating to be compatible with your lifestyle. Patients suddenly have more \"food rules\" than any diet they have ever followed. How do they eat enough to sustain themselves, yet continue to lose weight? Patients will no longer have the relationship with food they had prior to surgery. Issues that the R.D. addresses are: } Modifying eating behaviors } selecting proper food choices } preventing nutritional complications } how to avoid grazing and overeating } preparing healthy meals } making good choices when eating out It should not be assumed that patients, who appear to have met their goals for weight loss after 12-18 months, no longer need continued follow-up. It is common for patients to be less aware of their eating habits after year and often fall back into \"old habits.\" Lifetime follow-up is essential to reinforce proper food choices and good eating habits. The Registered Dietitian can provide education, resources and understanding that will help patients develop new, healthy, and positive relationships with food. Exercise Physiologist Before increasing physical activity and beginning any type of formal exercise program, it is important to get clearance from your doctor. A clinically trained Exercise Physiologist can help you make sure you are performing a program that suits your needs. Regular exercise after surgery is crucial to the weight loss process and long-term success. Some of the benets of exercise: } Burns calories and allows you to lose weight at a quicker and more consistent rate } Promotes the loss of fat mass and improves your muscle mass } Increases your metabolism } Improves the ease of performing everyday tasksBeginning an exercise program before surgery as well aswithin the rst few months after surgery, will make it easier for exercise to become part of your regular routine, as well as promote continued weight loss and eventually weight maintenance. Bariatric patients need two distinct forms of exercise, strength training and cardiovascular work. Strength training will consist of: } body weight machine } free weight exercises This form of exercise not only burns calories but is also the only form of exercise that can maintain and build muscle. Cardiovascular exercise is equally important, as it burns calories and fat mass in addition to improving heart, lung and circulatory functioning. Cardiovascular work consists of such exercise as: walking, jogging, bike riding, hiking, and swimming. It is important to note that as a bariatric patient strength work and cardiovascular work are two very separate qualities that should be trained as such. 20 Comprehensive Recovery Pathway for Bariatric Surgery Psychologist Bariatric surgery results in physical changes that aect how much food your body can intake and may also aect how it is digested and absorbed. However, it may not lead to changes in your emotional need to eat. Most patients are aware that they will have to forgo favorite foods following surgery, yet they are often ill prepared to deal with the severe emotional ties to food. Patients who have had an extensive history of issues that involve food and disordered eating may experience more challenges post- operatively than patients who do not. A therapist can help you to develop the appropriate emotional tools to transition into a healthy relationship with food and exercise. Cognitive behavior therapy will teach you how to focus on becoming more aware of your behavior and feelings and learning strategies to cope with your emotions. Additionally, therapy will challenge dysfunctional thinking, identify feelings and develop non-food coping skills. Gaining and maintaining motivation and inner strength will contribute to promoting adherence to your new lifestyle changes. Change is hard! It is crucial to understand how to handle the physical, mental, and emotional challenges after bariatric surgery.
