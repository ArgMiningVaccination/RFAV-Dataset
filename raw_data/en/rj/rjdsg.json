January 2, 2014 \"Irvine, Calif., Jan. 2, 2014 \u2014A compound derived from a traditional Chinese herbal medicine has been found effective at alleviating pain, pointing the way to a new nonaddictive analgesic for acute inflammatory and nerve pain, according to UC Irvine pharmaco logy researchers. Working with Chinese scientists, Olivier Civelli and his UC Irvine colleagues isolated a compound called dehydrocorybulbine (DHCB) from the roots of the Corydalis yanhusuo plant. In tests on rodents, DHCB proved to diminish both inflammatory pain, which is associated with tissue damage and the infiltration of immune cells, and injury -induced neuropathic pain, which is caused by damage to the nervou s system. This is important because there are no current adequate treatments for neuropathic pain. Moreover, the researchers found that DHCB did not generate the tolerance seen with continued use of most conventional pain re lievers, such as morphine. \"Today the pharmaceutical industry struggles to find new drugs. Yet for centuries people have used herbal remedies to address myriad health conditions, including pain. Our objective was to identify compounds in these herbal remedies that may help us discover new ways to treat health problems,\" said Civelli , the Eric L. & Lila D. Nelson Chair in Neuropharmacology. \"We're excited that this one shows promise as an effective pharmaceutical. It also shows a different way to understand the pain mechanism.\" Study results appear in the Jan. 20 issue of Current Biology\"Fairly recent new alkaloidWestern, Eclectic and Rainforest herbs in It derived the name Wolfbane in ancient times as arrows tipped with the juice of the plant were used to kill wolves.

This is unfortunate, because in appropriate doses, aconite is generally very safe and has many beneficial actions. Thorough knowledge of the herb is essential to insure safety, but given this, it serves as a potent addition to the botanical armamentarium....\" Quote from Dr E. (one minim is 1/480 of an ounce, or approximately 2 drops) so 2 to 16 drops per day = 1 -8 minums Aconitum Toxicity continued Under the restrictions of the 1968 Medicines Act, aconite in lotion form must not exceed 1.3 parts of aconite to 100 parts of lotion. When used internally, the root undergoes a special process to detoxify it. The process involves soaking the roots whole in vinegar for one month, followed by a salt water soak for one month. The process is repeated several times. In this prepared form it is sold under the name 'Aconitum praeparata ' or FU -ZI. These alkaloids and their metabolites act on voltage -sensitive sodium channels in excitable tissues (Friese et al., 1997). \"...Fresh roots with their intact alkaloids are significantly more potent and have higher potential for toxicity than dried or cooked roots. Heat converts aconitine and mesaconitine to benzylaconine derivatives, which are significantly less or an unpredictable risk?Topical Monkshood & the Eclectics The famous Eclectic MD, Dr Ellingwood also found that it could be extremely useful in the relief of acute pain and suggests, \"Perhaps the most immediate influence obtainable in acute pain is to put 5 drops each of Chloroform, and Aconite into the palm of the hand and hold it over the seat of pain for 2 -3 minutes. The effect is instantaneous and marvelous .\" Dr Z has used Terebinthum, camphor, menthol and aconite with great success in many painful afflictions Aconite has been used as a pain remedy wherever it is found. Headaches, rheumatic pains, arthritis, inflammatory pain, sciatica, pruritus ani, neuralgias and colicky pains have been treated historically with this plant ( Felter , Eclectic mat med. pg151,1922) (Sharp Med dose anesthetic Aconite first stimulates and later sedates the nerves connected to pain, touch and temperature, the initial tingling gives place to a long continued anesthetic action.

These patients were randomly divided into 5 groups. The general condition of every group was similar. Group A, B, C was given Lappaconitine 4 ml, 8 ml, 12 ml individually for observation. Group D, E was given 0.9% NS 6 ml and morphine 2 mg individually as control. When the operation was finished the drug was injected into the epidural space with single blind method. The result showed the analgesia of the drug and its effective time was: group E > C > B > A > D. The analgesic effect of Group C was satisfactory. The efficacy and the maintenance time of A, B, C groups were significantly different from that of group D (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Although the effect of group C was less potent than that of group E (morphine injection), there was no side -effect as morphine had.
