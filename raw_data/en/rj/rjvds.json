[Inner Traditions/Bear & Company](https://www.scribd.com/publisher/361356815/Inner-Traditions-Bear-Company) Reviews for Total Life Cleanse 1 rating0 reviews Book preview Total Life Cleanse - Jonathan Glass PREFACE How to Use This Book THIS BOOK UNFOLDS IN TWO PARTS. Part 1 shares my personal story and elucidates the reasons cleansing is essential and beneficial\u2014perhaps more so today than ever before. It also reveals the philosophical foundation behind cleansing and its ancient roots, including principles of modern nutritional science, ayurveda, and Chinese medicine. Additionally, part 1 illuminates optimal eating practices, harmonizes conflicting dietary information, and explores critical health strategies. Total Life Cleanse includes numerous references to ancient Vedic scriptures, such as the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam. These Eastern bible-like texts are thousands of years old and are among the sources of yoga and ayurvedic philosophy, including practical life teachings for the body, mind, and soul. Where Sanskrit words are used, you'll find translations to facilitate easy understanding. Part 2 is the how to section and includes everything you need to successfully cleanse. Here you'll find the Daily Routine Guide, the On the Cleanse/Off the Cleanse diet, recipes, seasonal tips, a shopping list, cleanse exercises, meditation practices, and supplement and herb recommendations, as well as all other pertinent and practical information. The way I see it, there are four ways you can use this book. Choose whichever one you think will work best for you. Read the entire book from front to back. Then do the cleanse, following the instructions in part 2. While you are cleansing, reread part 1. This is the most comprehensive approach to this cleansing process. Skip part 1 and go right to part 2, and follow the instructions to do the cleanse. While cleansing, carefully read the entire book; it should inspire you with its empowering information and wisdom. Read the entire book, and let it inspire you to accelerate your healing process. If you've cleansed before and have found additional cleansing practices effective, feel free to use them. This book contains a lot of information on a variety of topics, ranging from scientific to philosophical and technical to practical. Read the entire book straight through or move around to the sections that interest you the most. Then put it down and digest the information for a while. Come back to the book, and cleanse when you feel ready. Note to Practitioners Holistic doctors and practitioners of all kinds will find Total Life Cleanse to be a useful resource for: Improving their own personal health Increasing their knowledge of cleansing, nutrition, plant-based eating, ayurveda, and Chinese medicine Integrating the wide range of knowledge shared in this book Successfully integrating cleansing into their own practices INTRODUCTION How the Total Life Cleanse Came to Be Everyone has a physician inside him or her. We just have to support it in its work. The natural healing force within each one of us is the greatest force in becoming well. HIPPOCRATES THE PROGRAM OUTLINED IN THIS BOOK, which I call the Healing Essence Total Life Cleanse, was initially created by Dr. Kevin Gregg and me to provide the education, structure, and support the patients in our practice needed to cleanse safely and effectively. It was designed to simultaneously assist them in integrating into their life the healthiest whole-foods plant-based dietary and lifestyle practices. The cleanse presented in part 2 is our most widely practiced twenty-eight-day program. However, the program evolved through a series of different-length cleanses, some lasting for many weeks and others for just a few days. To our surprise and pleasure, even the shorter cleanses had powerful and positive results. I have personally experienced that total life cleansing consistently advances health and wellness, on every level of our being. This is why I am so passionate about sharing this information. You may reasonably wonder, Why would Jonathan choose to write another book on cleansing when there are so many others available? My answer is threefold: First, the Healing Essence Total Life Cleanse stems from decades of cleansing experience, both personally and in support of thousands of students through its transformative process. The breadth and depth of this experience, both in the doing and in the educating, inestimably increases its value. Many commercial cleanses are based on good logic. However, few, if any, have had our degree of personal, day-to-day, direct experience with students and patients. Unlike prepackaged programs, our program grew organically and was engendered by dedicated practitioners. There is nothing like real people having real experiences. After more than twenty years of working with patients facing troubling conditions, I can honestly say that I have witnessed the cleansing program initiate some of the most transformational turnarounds in health I could have ever imagined. Second, the approach to cleansing in this program is based on a holistic paradigm that uniquely takes into account body, mind, and soul as equally essential aspects of the healing process. Third, our health as human beings on this planet is at a tipping point. The Healing Essence Total Life Cleanse inculcates higher-octave universal philosophical and spiritual values that significantly contribute to both personal and planetary healing. The Healing Essence Total Life Cleanse will support you in: Understanding the countless benefits of cleansing Cleansing deeply and effectively, on many levels Avoiding the potential pitfalls and downsides of cleansing Making positive dietary and lifestyle changes for a lifetime Improving your health in body, mind, and spirit Making a positive impact on our environment and all of its inhabitants Cleansing and detoxification have been practiced as healing arts on this planet for many thousands of years. Time and time again, it's been confirmed that how we eat and how we live directly impact the environment and our health in body, mind, and spirit. Even our relationships improve when we eat and live well, and we find improved mental clarity, less pain, and more joy. Everyone in our circle benefits. In this way, the Healing Essence Total Life Cleanse is ancient wisdom adapted to modern times\u2014dramatically enhancing its effectiveness. Appreciating the deeper purpose of cleansing profoundly amplifies the cleansing experience. Cleansing is not simply about purifying an organ, improving elimination, or even curing ourselves of serious disease. Ultimately, it's about knowing ourselves, fulfilling our life purpose, and reawakening the magic and divinity of life. It is about cleansing our life of obstacles, from the ground up. When we clear physical blocks and toxins within the context of cultivating an awareness of broader truths and goals in our life, authentic healing on every level can take place. Ayurveda, the ancient system of medicine from India, incorporates cleansing in all aspects of healing. The ayurvedic comprehensive detoxification program, called panchakarma, includes an appropriate cleanse diet, designed according to the individual's symptoms and constitution. The Chinese dietetic philosophy also supports eating in a clean and balanced way, in alignment with your energetic pattern to support optimal health and detoxification. Similar practices have been used for thousands of years in these and other ancient cultures, and they are still practiced today. Modern medicine has introduced remarkable discoveries, but too often it encourages blind faith in invasive and unhealthy medical practices. It has a tendency to overuse technology, surgery, and drugs to treat illness when dietary, herbal, and lifestyle changes could engender far safer and better results\u2014whether in conjunction with conventional medicine or alone. After many years of overdependence on drugs and surgery and complete denial regarding how quality of food, diet, and lifestyle impact our well-being, we are seeing a resurgence of interest in natural health and healing. This movement began in the early 1970s and has steadily continued. Now, the potency of natural healing, eating clean organic food, cleansing, and detoxification is finally being acknowledged and is penetrating the fabric of modern culture. This is great news! My Personal Journey to Cleansing I share my story, with its twists and turns, to give you a better sense of how I came to cleansing and my perspectives on it. It is also my hope that you'll find some of my experiences and the insights I discovered along the way to be motivating. When I was young, I was plagued by allergies. I had a severe allergic reaction twice\u2014once at eleven months old and again at two years of age. Early on, milk and seasonal pollens were identified as the culprits. As I grew, I continued to suffer from serious allergic symptoms. I was regularly prescribed antihistamine drugs, allergy shots, nose sprays, and other medicines. While I was a relatively good student, there were times when these medications, combined with my allergies, seriously interfered with my capacity to function in school. During my high school years, I developed at least one serious bronchial infection every year\u2014and it was always treated with antibiotics. When I was a senior, I was captain of the varsity hockey team. For much of the season I barked like a dog on the ice, due to a thick, mucous-rich cough that took over three months to clear, even with strong antibiotics. At around the age of fifteen, I became interested in meditation and yoga during a summer camp job in Maine. Jamie, a dear friend, had shared a book with me called Be Here Now, by Ram Dass. All that summer, we immersed ourselves in Be Here Now, along with the mystical shamanism books by Carlos Castaneda. Each day we committed to living in the here and now, meditating daily and leading nightly campfires with friends. It was a magical time of budding personal development and spiritual growth. That summer, I directly experienced how the quality of our consciousness impacts our lives. Throughout my high school years, I continued practicing various forms of meditation, guided especially by the teachings of Paramahansa Yogananda. Yogananda emphasized how diet, lifestyle, and meditation simultaneously benefit the body, mind, and soul. As I meditated daily, my capacity for concentration, studying, athletic ability, and inner peace greatly improved. It was also then that I began to understand the connection between diet, energy, and mood. Still, due to my habits and attachments, I was reluctant to make permanent changes. In college I played varsity soccer. I noticed that my lung capacity was weaker than that of many of my teammates. While I was quite athletic, skilled, and determined, I just didn't have the endurance of our best players. One day during that time, I came upon a small health food store in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and met a man who changed my life. Rusty was a calm, handsome, long-haired, and vibrantly healthy-looking guy. I told him about my lung and allergy issues, and he recommended a few products. In particular, he gave me a seed extract supplement that Russian athletes used to increase oxygen in the blood. He also recommended that I read an old classic nutrition and herbal book called Back to Eden, by Jethro Kloss. I took the supplement before my next soccer practice and was amazed by the increase in my lung capacity, and the resulting greater endurance. I had had no idea that there were actually natural substances that really worked. I thought to myself, If Rusty's recommendation regarding the supplement was so right on, perhaps the book will have some helpful information too. I began to read the bible-like text with great interest. It contained so much information. Kloss was zealous in his beliefs, which I found to be contagious. With passion, he declared that moving from a meat- and dairy-based diet to one that was based primarily on plants and dairy-free could alleviate many symptoms and diseases, including allergies. It was a new and exciting concept to me. I had been accustomed to eating my meals at my soccer fraternity house, where Jack, the four-hundred-pound drunken chef, fried everything in lard and smothered it with cheese. My soccer coach recommended that we eat meat and dairy the night before a game; my roommate and I would obediently order large extra-cheese hamburger pizzas. I always felt utterly horrible the next morning: heavy, tired, congested, sluggish, and depressed. It often took me at least half of the game before I really got moving. I may have been a coachable player, but I felt awful. Back to Eden ignited a light of insight and hope. I immediately stopped eating meat and dairy. Within a few days, my allergy symptoms began to diminish remarkably. I was stunned. After suffering for so many years, could it be this simple? I decided to stick with the program and find out. As a college student, I had little ability to make my own dietary choices, especially as a new vegetarian. I did my best. This meant lots of fruit, iceberg lettuce salads, nuts, and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Now, this may not sound very healthy, but eliminating dairy and lard-fried meats was so helpful that I felt amazing for weeks. However, over time, I began to feel somewhat fatigued. The overcooked fraternity veggies and PB&Js were no longer cutting it. While I remained mindful of the impact that dairy and meat had on my body, I gradually slid back to old eating habits\u2014cheese, ice cream, and even Jack's addictive fatty dishes. However, I noticed that if I took a break from dairy at the point when my allergies began to flare up, my congestion would often recede. I never allowed my symptoms to return to being as horrible as they once were. During my last semester in college, I studied religions that had newly cropped up in the West. The Hare Krishna movement was notable; my class went for a field trip to their farm in Port Royal, Pennsylvania. It was fascinating! As I was already practicing yoga and meditation, I understood the basic tenets of their philosophy. One of the principles they emphasized was vegetarianism\u2014they were very strong on this point. It gave me a lot to think about. Jethro Kloss spoke of vegetarianism primarily from the perspective of health for the body and mind. The Hare Krishnas spoke about it from a more philosophical perspective\u2014that of ahimsa, or nonviolence. They taught that all living beings, from insects to humans, have souls and are also children of God. They believed this was a truth that was ignored in most religious and spiritual traditions. While I liked their perspective on vegetarianism very much, I was still attached to my grandmother's Jewish cooking and family barbecues. That summer, while working in Boston, I decided to visit the local Hare Krishna temple. There, I met a sweet Krishna devotee, Champakalata Dasi, who was very kind to me. Before work, I would visit her at the temple and have lunch. Each time, she would bring me a huge plate of the most amazing vegetarian food. While I ate, we'd discuss philosophy. She would inevitably ask, Have you stopped eating meat yet? I would sheepishly say, No, not yet, but I am eating less. However, I soon found that as I continued to eat this wonderful food she called prasad, or blessed food, it became mysteriously easy to give up eating meat. Gradually, I noticed my health improving once again. Finally, by the end of the summer, I decided to go 100 percent vegetarian, thanks to my experience with Champakalata's blessed food and her kind yet firm encouragement. I began to understand what my yoga teachers had meant about how food affects our mind and consciousness. Vegetarianism soon became a way of life for me\u2014a way to feel healthier in body, mind, and spirit. My journey continued when I took a trip to Europe\u2014a college graduation gift from my parents. Outside Paris, I met Luna, a woman staying at a Hare Krishna farm I was visiting. She and I became dear friends and decided to travel together, ultimately planning a trip to India. Luna was fifteen years older than I and had been a vegetarian for over twenty years. We traveled from France to Spain, to the beaches in Portugal, and then to Italy, making many friends along the way. We shopped at local outdoor food markets and made the most opulent salads with beautiful produce. We had bread with bee pollen and raw honey every day and, oh, the olives! What a blessed time it was! I was eating better than ever and feeling great. I learned so much from Luna and experienced for myself that it was possible to be a vibrant, healthy, nondairy vegetarian. I saw it as a win-win-win lifestyle\u2014good for me, good for the animals, and good for the planet! Eventually Luna and I made our way to India. There, we lived in yoga ashrams, studied with various teachers, and traveled throughout the country, at times together, and sometimes going off on our own. I became more committed to being vegetarian. I also delved deeply into Eastern philosophy, bhakti yoga, and ayurveda. Eventually, while participating in a sacred fire ceremony, I made a lifetime vow to refrain from eating meat, fish, and eggs. To this day, I have no regrets about taking that vow, nor have I found it difficult to sustain. However, living in India did take a toll on my health. I had numerous bouts of dysentery and parasitic infections. It didn't help that I was an overconfident twenty-two-year-old, walking barefoot everywhere and eating whatever food I was offered. After some time, I returned to Europe and then the States to regain my health and visit my family. After living in ashrams for five years, I decided to begin a new chapter studying massage and nutrition at the Heartwood Institute, located in the hills of beautiful Garberville, California. There, I gradually recovered my health, eating amazingly well, just as I had with Luna, but with even more variety. Heartwood was a place of true healing\u2014a powerful place of light. I studied massage, polarity therapy, energy healing, nutrition, hypnotherapy, cleansing, and anatomy and physiology. I immersed myself in my studies every day. I had the great fortune to study with spiritual teacher, profound healer, and master polarity therapist Bruce Burger, one of my most important teachers of all time. Bruce was also adept in ayurveda, cleansing, and detoxification. It was at Heartwood with him that I did the first of many cleanses. We did juice fasts, liver flushes, rainbow diet cleanses, enemas, herbs, raw sprout diets, water fasting, sweat lodges, emotional release work, Native American peyote prayer meetings, kirtans, yoga, and more. We learned, healed, and practiced in Heartwood's beautiful sacred environment. Often, while sleeping under the stars, I felt heart-expanding floods of gratitude for this profoundly healing time. It was then and there that I realized that I wanted to share the gifts of healing and natural health with others. When I came to Heartwood, I was still recovering from weak digestion due to India's parasites and the limited food choices in ashram life. I experimented with a variety of cleanses that were happening there, and these wonderful opportunities led to my full recovery. They also taught me which cleanse protocols worked and which ones did not. The cleanses were powerful, healing, spiritual experiences that inspired profound insights about my body, mind, relationships, life, and soul. I realized that cleansing was not just about the body but had the capacity to powerfully touch us at core levels of our being. These experiences turned out to be extremely influential in the development of the Healing Essence Total Life Cleanse. I also discovered that coming off a cleanse is an extremely important phase of the process! One of my first cleanses was an eleven-day rainbow juice fast led by my friend and brilliant homeopath Kim Elia. Throughout the day, we would juice fruits and vegetables whose colors corresponded to the chakra/rainbow color sequence\u2014first red, then orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, and indigo plants. It was a fun, deep, and inspiring juice-fast cleanse. My body, mind, and heart felt lighter and clearer than ever before. On the last day, while sitting in a hot tub under sunny skies, a friend came by to share some beautiful ripe peaches. We were meant to end our cleanse by eating small amounts of peeled fruit. Well, I didn't take time to pause, and wow, skin and all, did I enjoy those six peaches! Unfortunately, they sat in my lower right intestine without budging, literally, for four days. I was miserably uncomfortable. For the next few months, my digestion was erratic, disturbed, and weak. I felt as if I was unable to fully digest anything. From that point on, I was much more careful to follow the protocols for finishing a cleanse. Over the following months I tried a series of different cleanses with the intention of finally remedying my digestive issues. With the help of these cleanses, along with Chinese medicine, herbs, homegrown organic veggies, probiotics, and digestive enzymes, I found my way back to solid digestive health. Each cleanse taught me a great deal. I also learned about proper postcleanse practices and how to successfully transition from cleansing to eating a more diverse and healthy plant-based diet. Somehow, I knew that one day I would be supporting others to do the same. While at Heartwood, I became a certified massage therapist, a certified hypnotherapist, and a certified natural health educator. A few years later, I also became an acupuncturist and a certified ayurvedic therapist (C.A.T.). For many years, I continued to delve deeply into the areas of whole food nutrition, herbs, and diet and lifestyle practices. I became even more committed to a healthy, vegetarian lifestyle and have continued eating that way for over thirty years. In 1997 I became close with a colleague, Dr. Kevin Gregg. Dr. Gregg is an exceptionally gifted holistic chiropractic doctor currently practicing outside of Dallas, Texas. One day, we were discussing how challenging it was to treat patients with dietary and lifestyle habits that significantly interfere with their health. So many suffer greatly, as I once did, from food sensitivities, toxins, parasites, leaky gut, and other stressors that contribute to the devastation of their health in body and mind. We were both frustrated by our inability to significantly help these patients. Nutritional counseling, acupuncture, and chiropractic treatments were simply not enough. Simultaneously, we were struck by an insight: supporting patients in a group setting would give them the ability make the dietary and lifestyle changes necessary to radically improve their health, and the additional support and education would dramatically enhance the value of our treatments. For many months Kevin and I brainstormed together. We each brought our individual gifts, clinical insights, and experiences with cleansing and created our first healing cleanse program, which we called, appropriately, the Total Body Cleanse. We were thrilled with the extraordinary results of our initial five-week program. Over the next few years, we continued to develop the cleanse program. With the assistance of Sherry, our new assistant, we took our education, organization, and professionalism to another level. These were exciting times. Dr. Gregg and I learned so much while teaching together. We discovered, firsthand, what happens when people are genuinely given the support they need to make essential health-related changes. The Total Body Cleanse created an environment in which these powerful changes were possible. Our patients began to remarkably transform their health and habits. Our own lives as practitioners were also transformed and became far more enjoyable. The insights we've gained through leading cleanses continue to profoundly influence our present-day practices. My wife, Katherine, and I opened our healing center, the Healing Essence Center in Concord, Massachusetts, in 1992, and it is still going strong. We love the name, as it has always been our intention to dive deep with our patients and do our best to support authentic healing. To us, the word essence is deeply meaningful. It refers to our aim of getting to the core of healing with every patient we come in contact with. It's also closely related to the Sanskrit word svarupa, which means one's true or essential nature. Our svarupa, or essential soul nature, indicates our deepest divine potential. After developing the Total Body Cleanse with Dr. Gregg, we incorporated the cleanse on a seasonal basisinto our center's programming. We soon realized that our program was having results that went far beyond the body. At the Healing Essence Center, the cleanse evolved to include work on creating new healthy life habits and eliminating harmful ones, expanding awareness, and supporting students in delving deeply within themselves\u2014in finding their inner healing essence. To better fit the expanded program, we changed the name from Total Body Cleanse to Healing Essence Total Life Cleanse (TLC). We liked the parallel with the acronym TLC, tender loving care. Plenty of TLC is certainly required for us to cleanse, heal, and reconnect to our inner essence. Life frequently takes on new and reinspired meaning after the Total Life Cleanse. It is not just about the body, the toxins, the candida, the parasites, the liver, the intestines, or even the brain or nervous system. It's about the essential self within! Of course it's necessary to cleanse on all levels if we hope to improve our quality of life. However, TLC ultimately is about removing fundamental blocks that stand in the way of our becoming our most authentic self. It's about connecting to our soul essence, bringing it into our lives, and then sharing that essence with others, inspiring them to do the same. Life has many challenges. How we live and eat is so primal that it impacts the quality of everything we do. For those who aspire to live at their highest capacity and vibration, regular seasonal cleansing is essential. Later in this book, I will go into detail about how every organ and tissue in the body relates to a specific emotion and state of mind. When we treat an organ or tissue with the right food and safe, effective lifestyle and detoxification practices, it becomes easier to emotionally heal and connect to our essence. This connection allows us to rediscover ourselves and increases our capacity to achieve our true goals in life, realize who we are, and fulfill our purpose here on Earth. Authentic cleansing supports us in continuing to eat and live in ways that truly enhance our well-being\u2014well-being not only for ourselves but also for all creatures, our environment, and the planet. Everything is connected. To sum up, the intention of the Healing Essence Total Life Cleanse is to remove blocks, effect deep healing, increase our awareness of the interdependency and inter-connectedness of all life, and allow us to realize our potential as incredible and beautiful beings. Can you undertake the cleanse simply to lose weight, feel better, lower blood pressure, decrease pain, improve elimination, improve sleep, or address a serious disease? Of course! But along the way, all TLC participants will learn a lot about themselves, about life, and about the profound potential of a soul having a human experience. This is healing essence. PART I The Why of the Total Life Cleanse 1 Essentials of Cleansing As long as you live, keep learning to live. SENECA NEVER BEFORE IN RECORDED HISTORY have we been so intensively exposed to such a barrage of toxins, including biological, dietary, chemical, heavy metal, electrical, and radioactive ones, as well as modern-day emotional, psychological, and spiritual stressors. With thousands of man-made chemicals in our water and air\u2014far too many of which have never been tested for human safety\u2014and electrical smog in the form of electromagnetic and wireless frequencies clouding the ether, it is no wonder that so many types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and anxiety disorders are exponentially on the rise. In addition to environmental stressors and toxins, the nutritional quality of our food and produce has significantly diminished in the past fifty years. The synergistic effect of stress, toxicity, and nutritional depletion is devastating to our well-being. The good news is that the principle of synergy\u2014the property of combining elements to create an effect greater than the sum of their parts\u2014works just as effectively in a positive direction. When we manage stress more effectively, heal the nervous system, improve our nutritional status, eliminate stored toxins, and reduce our exposure to environmental and dietary toxins, we regain and enhance our potential for health, vitality, and mental and spiritual clarity. What Is Cleansing? Cleansing is the art and process of making health-enhancing dietary and lifestyle changes that reboot our natural potential for vibrant well-being. It is a method of relieving the body and mind from the burden of toxicity and unhealthy stress. It is truly remarkable how positively the body and mind respond when given an opportunity. After a balanced cleanse, we normally experience many subtle and not-so-subtle benefits, including: Reduced aches and pains Improved digestion Enhanced energy Stronger immunity A calmer and more focused mind More pleasure from the taste of whole foods Clearer skin The loss of excess weight A deeper internal connection A sense of personal empowerment Improved relationships Deeper connection to our innate wisdom and life purpose These are just a few of the rewards that come from cleansing and taking our health and our lives into our own hands! Ayurveda and Cleansing The TLC dietary and lifestyle program is based on a foundation of ayurvedic principles and philosophy. Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that has flourished in India for over five thousand years. In Sanskrit, ayurveda means knowledge of the totality of life. Ayurveda is a deeply rich, practical, and profound system of holistic medicine in which the body, the senses, the mind, and the soul are acknowledged and considered as a single integrated system. It comprises highly sophisticated and advanced herbal, dietary, and lifestyle approaches to healing. Cleansing and detoxification are fundamental practices of ayurveda, and they were considered important even thousands of years ago when our water and air were pure and humankind was not challenged with modern society's high levels of stress. In today's challenging world, it is even more essential that we use this time-tested wisdom. If we wish to reach our greatest potential, we can no longer embrace the standard American diet of refined sugars, bad fats, refined carbohydrates, processed foods, excessive animal protein, and hormone- and toxin-laden dairy. Humankind would do well to embrace many of the tenets of ayurveda, including using its proven detoxification protocols, stress management techniques, and consciousness-raising practices\u2014all of which are essential components of the cleansing techniques being introduced here. Ayurveda recognizes the uniqueness of each individual. It incorporates acute treatment, stress and health management, spiritual practices, and lifestyle guidance for lifetime maintenance of health and vitality, which by necessity involves emotional and spiritual growth. Ayurveda is the sister practice to yoga; the two work in harmony to support our healing journey. Many people are aware that yoga offers numerous health benefits, and it is practiced widely all over the world for peace of mind, discipline, strength, flexibility, self-control, and well-being. However, not everyone is acquainted with yoga's inner purpose, which is to help us experientially realize who we are in truth\u2014the ever-present soul or atma, the eternal part and parcel of Spirit or God. Ayurveda teaches us that we are responsible for our ultimate well-being. Its principles help us live in these times of both great awakening and profound challenges. We will explore some of its key concepts more fully later in the book. Our Organs of Detoxification We have five essential organs of detoxification: the lungs, liver, kidneys, large intestine, and skin. Each of these organs assists in the body's natural process of detoxification. As we breathe, particulates in the air are trapped by the tiny hairs in our nasal passages and captured by alveoli and mucous secretions in our lungs. Our lungs extract oxygen from the air we inhale and discharge acidic carbon dioxide through exhalation. Amazingly, we eliminate 60 to 70 percent of our acid waste through our lungs. As we eat, the food we chew enters our digestive system, beginning with digestive enzymes in the mouth and then gastric juices in the stomach, which assist in breaking down the food. These juices also eliminate pathogens from the outer world, such as microbes, viruses, and parasites. Food is then broken down further in the small intestine, where it is absorbed through the intestinal walls into the bloodstream and carried, via the portal vein, into the liver. The liver filters out toxins and prepares them for elimination through the large intestine. The liver also processes nutrients and determines the distribution and storage of essential nutrients such as amino acids and glucose. Almost everything that is not absorbed through the small intestine is passed on and eliminated through the colon, with the exception of some trace minerals. The kidneys process and purify about 20 percent of our blood. They help regulate our pH (acid/alkaline balance) and extract and remove wastes (urea, acid, ammonia, drugs, toxins) in the form of urine, which flows to the bladder and is excreted. The skin is also a powerful organ of detoxification. It uses sweat glands to remove acidic fat-soluble toxins found in the lymph and fat. Most people's sweat contains hundreds of toxins, including hormones and pesticides. In fact, regularly breaking a sweat takes the burden off the kidneys and is an important part of the detoxification process. When we are young, our organs of detoxification generally function with ease. As we get older, dehydration, scar tissue, stiffness, stress, and toxins burden our organs. As a result, we can experience low-grade symptoms of dis-ease and may become increasingly ill. Eventually, many of us forget what a good-quality life feels like. Quite often, poor diet and lifestyle end up decreasing our duration of life. The Original Causes of Disease Ayurveda believes that the origin of disease lies with toxins or ama, and that they often first appear in the digestive tract. From this perspective, the digestive system can be seen as similar to the roots of a tree. Imagine a tree with a damaged or toxic root system; its branches, leaves, and fruits will be compromised. This occurs in our body as well. Digestion breaks down food so that tiny roots located in the small intestine can absorb nutrients. The tissues of the body can then be properly nourished. If I become clogged and dysfunctional due to excessive toxins or ama, poor diet, stress, or inherent weakness, my body becomes unable to nourish itsself, and the first stage of disease is initiated. According to the ayurvedic sages, one cause of disease can occur even prior to ama. It is expressed in Sanskrit as prajnaparadha (pronounced prag-yapa-rad). The general translation is, to ignore our knowledge that comes from experience, innate wisdom, and intuition. In everyday terms, all actions that move us away from love and wisdom are truly the original cause of disease! (We will discuss prajnaparadha in detail in chapter 9.) The ancient ayurvedic text Asthangha Hridayam names fourteen bodily urges that, if frequently suppressed or unnaturally forced, will lead to disease. Denying any of them is an example of prajnaparadha\u2014ignoring the innate wisdom of the body. They are: Passing gas Pooping Peeing Burping Sneezing Thirst Hunger Sleep Coughing Rapid breathing upon exertion Yawning Tears Vomiting Orgasm Repeatedly repressing urges eventually causes energetic stagnation, toxic buildup, and physical damage. These can significantly impact corresponding organs and tissues. Respectfully honoring these urges is no small thing. Being in tune with our natural urges is essential for good health and enhances our intuitive knowing of our own bodies. Indulgence, however, is not the message here\u2014we are not meant to force these urges to occur. Additionally, if we want happiness, ayurveda says that there are nonphysical urges that we should suppress: greed, envy, hatred, jealousy, excessive desire, and lack of self-control. We all have an internal guidance system that offers wisdom, intuition, feelings, and experiences that guide our lives and decisions. For various reasons, including childhood wounding and familial, social, and cultural conditioning, we sometimes ignore or mistrust this internal guidance and natural wisdom. Continually doing so causes us to make decisions and create habits that hinder our health on every level, from the subtle to the gross. This affects our physical and emotional health, our relationships (our capacity to give and receive love), and even the Earth's environment, including the entire fabric of our life experience. The Soul and Healing Wisdom is the greatest cleanser. SRI YUKTESWAR True health necessarily includes an experience and realization of our essential nature\u2014which is also the goal of ayurveda and the yoga system. Without access to our essential nature, we are bound to live in imbalance and to miss altogether the purpose of achieving health. As we have seen, contact with our inner nature or soul essence directly and positively impacts our health. The soul has an expanding and emanating energy and is the source of all of our vitality, awareness, wisdom, happiness, and capacity to love. Conscious contact with our soul essence is the root of healing, as well as the inner purpose of cleansing. In summary, cleansing gives the body, mind, and soul a rest from the continual challenges of the modern world and the chance to eliminate excess physical and mental toxins, from chemicals and heavy metals to parasites, fungi, viruses, and bacteria to anxiety, irritability, fear, and distress. Cleansing offers us the opportunity to remove these obstacles, regenerate, and connect to our inner source of energy and vitality. The TLC Approach to Cleansing After many years of personal experimentation, I have found that a gradual and incremental approach to cleansing, over a number of days, weeks, or even months, produces the greatest benefit. This approach to cleansing, though it may seem slow, is very powerful and can have fast and remarkable results. Severe or aggressive cleansing is generally not recommended. It usually doesn't work to hurry up and cleanse. It's kind of like trying to hurry up and meditate. Detox reactions (such as a stuffy nose, headaches, body aches, and digestive issues) can arise when our cells release toxins faster than our body can eliminate them. This encourages toxins to relocate from one area of the body to another, which can lead to new or progressive symptoms in a phenomenon known as the detox/retox syndrome. The slow and steady approach to cleansing can help us avoid severe detoxification reactions. In overly aggressive cleansing, the benefits gained can sometimes be quickly lost as the body is overwhelmed with released toxins. The Healing Essence Total Life Cleanse includes: Four dietary phases Two super detox phases Hygienic detox practices Transformational lifestyle practices Sweating practices Media fasting and other mind-cleansing practices Daily yoga, breathing, meditation, and exercise practices Dietary supplements and herbs Meal and smoothie recipes TLC is not simply a juice fast, nor is it a system of self-deprivation. You will be drinking delicious smoothies, and you will have the option of eating tasty foods from wonderful cleanse recipes gathered over the years. You will be eating clean, but you will not go hungry! Each morning, you will take TLC-supportive herbal supplements along with your smoothie. You will also integrate simple yet powerful breathing and yoga practices into your daily life, and they will bring you greater strength, mental calm, and peace. And it doesn't all end with the last day of the cleanse. The tools you learn to use, the insights you gain, and the inspiration you receive will travel with you in the days and years to come. For many, TLC becomes an ongoing process and can even become a way of life. In my practice, cleanses are most often held within a group format, with the group of participants meeting once a week for the duration of the cleanse. These gatherings are extremely rich learning experiences and offer camaraderie and support for your growing insights. Often, however, people who are interested in the program are not able to attend the group meetings. If that's the case for you, this book\u2014and the accompanying videos covering all aspects of the Healing Essence Total Life Cleanse, which you can find at www.totallifecleanse.com\u2014should provide the guidance and support you need. This book, however, is not only for my students. It is for anyone wanting to transform their health in body, mind, and soul. So dive deep! Doing so, we emerge refreshed, inspired, and more connected to our exquisite divine essence. 2 Our Modern Condition We don't need to do anything to maintain the beauty of forests, rivers and mountains. However, when human beings systematically plunder natural wealth for selfish reasons, the natural order gets disturbed . . . the pulse of human life becomes erratic and Nature's face becomes disfigured. . . . We cannot delay anymore. We must make the right decisions and embark on the right course of actions. AMMA WE ARE LIVING IN INTERESTING TIMES. Our modern condition involves greater levels of daily stress and exposure to chemical and environmental toxins than ever before. For many of us, day-to-day modern stress does not commonly involve life-or-death situations. However, we are exposed to perpetual dietary, environmental, sensory, familial, work-related, and social stressors. They relentlessly and silently nibble away at our energy and health. Much of this stress can be reduced or even eliminated by using the effective dietary and lifestyle practices available today. In short, there are two main reasons we cleanse: 1. The body naturally builds up toxins. Even within a relatively clean environment and with a healthy diet, we benefit from regular seasonal cleansing. Cleansing has always been the foundation of natural health systems, including ayurveda and Chinese medicine. These systems honor the body's innate intelligence and its ability to heal itself. 2. Our modern condition contributes signficant amounts of toxins and stress-ors to our daily existence. The need for regular cleansing is greater than ever. Cancer, heart disease, and diabetes\u2014the diseases of modernity\u2014are off the charts and on the rise. Statistically, one in two men and one in three women will develop cancer at some point in their life.\u00b9 While it is helpful to identify and mitigate an individual's personal stressors, the Healing Essence Total Life Cleanse addresses all stressors, and it guides participants toward allowing their body to regenerate and heal from their negative impact on body, mind, and soul. Through cleansing, many people are able to identify the source of their problems as well as dietary and lifestyle practices that can help resolve them. Stressed, Starved, and Poisoned Stressed, starved, and poisoned is our modern condition and the origin of many of our ailments. In particular, being stressed, starved, and poisoned leads to chronic inflammation and oxidation, both of which are involved in most forms of disease. Stressed Never before in human history have our minds and nervous systems been so relentlessly stimulated on a daily basis. We take in staggering amounts of data through our senses, and the pace and complexity of life increases every day. Most of us rarely take sufficient time to eat well, exercise, meditate, sleep, and recreate. Stress causes a cascade of hormonal events, such as increased insulin, norepinephrine, and cortisol levels. Chronic stress disrupts our hormone balance as well as the body's ability to use hormones effectively. Stress also interferes with the adaptive capacity of our endocannabinoid system, which directly influences our emotional behaviors, mood, and anxiety levels. These disruptions lead to long-term damage to the nervous system, organs, glands, and tissues. The bottom line? In a unique way, people in modern civilization are more stressed on a daily basis than at any other time in known history. Starved How can we be starved today, even in "}
