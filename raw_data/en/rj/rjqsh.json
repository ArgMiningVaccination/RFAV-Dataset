The Student Health Center provides guidance to students on all matters related to COVID-19. Students who are symptomatic and test positive for SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are asked to follow the recommendations of the Health Center regarding isolation and return to class. Health Center providers will recommend best practices for preventing spread of illness to vulnerable members of the campus and Waltham communities. Students who do not follow Health Center recommendations may be reported to the Dean of Students Office and subject to disciplinary action. Campus Guidelines [ Expand All ](#) Face masks are optional on campus, but may be required in certain classrooms, offices, and other spaces. New and returning students are not required to submit proof of vaccination as a condition of matriculation. - Asymptomatic screening for SARS-CoV2 is no longer performed. - Symptomatic students should self test with a home rapid antigen test kit (available at local pharmacies) and in cases where there is concern for a false negative the Health Center can evaluate symptomatic students at the Respiratory Unit. The provider can perform rapid antigen tests on site or send an anterior nasal swab for the more sensitive and specific SARS-CoV2 molecular PCR test via Quest laboratories. Vaccination Policy The university strongly recommends that all members of the Brandeis community receive COVID-19 vaccination in order to safeguard their own health and the health of our employees, students, and campus community from COVID-19. However, vaccination is not required. Students and families should [contact the Brandeis Health Center](../index.html) with questions about this information, or with questions about other student vaccination requirements. Testing Positive [ Expand All ](#) In general, with some exceptions, for positive COVID-19 cases and symptomatic contacts: - Report your COVID positive result on via the [Patient Portal](https://brandeis.medicatconnect.com/) - [Isolate in place for a minimum of 5 days](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html). - This means limiting exposure to others by staying at home. - If you live with other people, coordinate with them how you can minimize their exposure. - If you must be exposed to others during this time, wear the best mask you have and limit your exposure as much as possible. - On-campus students: do not leave your dorm unless it is to pick up food, use the bathroom, or do laundry during less-busy, low traffic hour times. - Off-campus students: do not come to campus unless it is to visit the Health Center, by appointment only. - The day you test positive or have an onset of symptoms counts as \"Day zero.\" - The earliest a positive case can resume normal activity is following day 5 of isolation in place, meaning on day 6. - If a case meets the criteria to release before day 10, they must mask at all times while around others throughout day 10. - Students may ONLY release from isolation in place when all of their symptoms are resolved: - No fever (100.4\u00baF) for 24 hours - No medications like Advil or Tylenol for 24 hours - Students do NOT need to test negative for COVID-19 in order to release. - On-campus students may isolate in place off-campus if they can relocate in a private/personal vehicle. - COVID-positive on campus students and their roommates should wear masks while awake and in their room together. It is not recommended to wear a mask while sleeping. - Clean your hands often. - Cover your mouth when you cough and sneeze. - Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces (for example, doorknobs, tables, handles, light switches, and countertops) in your room and bathroom. - Take steps to improve ventilation, such as using fans to improve air flow. - Don't share personal household items, like cups, towels, and utensils. - Monitor your symptoms. If you have an [emergency warning sign](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html#Emergency) (like trouble breathing or persistent pain/pressure in the chest), seek emergency medical care immediately. - To access emergency medical care, call BEMCo at 781-736-3333. If you are off campus, call 911. - You may pick up to-go meals from the dining halls using a green, to-go or a compostable container. - If you don't have a green to-go container, one may be obtained at the dining hall. - For \"food on the go\" information visit [Starship Mobile](https://www.brandeishospitality.com/starship-mobile/). Please wear a mask at all times while picking up meals. - Reach out to your instructors about keeping up with your coursework while you are isolating in place. Exposure or Feeling Unwell [ Expand All ](#) Brandeis University no longer traces COVID exposures. Students who have been exposed to a person with COVID-19 should follow the [exposure guidelines provided by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/if-you-were-exposed.html). Quick Resources - Rapid and PCR testing are available at the Student Health Center by appointment only. - It's more convenient to have a stock of tests handy in case you develop symptoms on a weekend or off-hours. - Students should come to school with a supply of at-home rapid COVID-19 tests, which are available for purchase at [local pharmacies](../emergencies/pharmacies.html). - If you test positive for COVID, STAY IN YOUR ROOM OR AT HOME; do not come to campus. A positive is a positive, whether on a rapid or a PCR test. - You may pick up to-go meals from the dining halls using a green, to-go or a compostable container. - If you don't have a green to-go container, one may be obtained at the dining hall. - For \"food on the go\" information visit [Starship Mobile](https://www.brandeishospitality.com/starship-mobile/). Please wear a mask at all times while picking up meals. - If you feel unwell and are unsure if you should engage in campus activities, please contact the Student Health Center to discuss your concerns at [brandeishealthcenter@brandeis.edu](mailto:brandeishealthcenter@brandeis.edu) or 781-736-3677. Everyone has a day when they wake in the morning and exhibit some sort of a symptom that could be associated with COVID-19, whether it's a cold, allergies, or it actually is COVID. If you are unsure about what to do, here are some options: - Take a rapid COVID-19 test. - If your test is negative, but you had an exposure to someone who tested positive for COVID-19, or if you recently engaged in activities that might expose you to COVID, such as large, crowded indoor events or travel, follow the directions for [student exposures](#exposure). - Stay in your room or at home. Reach out to your instructors explaining that you are sick and follow the instructor's guidance, whether they would prefer you to attend class in-person, attend remotely, or otherwise. If you need help communicating with your faculty. [Academic Advising](https://www.brandeis.edu/academic-services/advising/) is available to assist. - Please do not be a \"hero\" and come to campus if you are sick with COVID-19, or with anything else that could infect other people! Part of being a responsible community member is knowing when to stay home. Everyone around you will appreciate your choice to stay home when you are sick. "}
