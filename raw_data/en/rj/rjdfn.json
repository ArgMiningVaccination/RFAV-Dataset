[Read More ](https://www.mindful.org/why-do-we-feel-awe/) Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we're doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what's going on around us. While mindfulness is something we all naturally possess, it's more readily available to us when we practice on a daily basis. Whenever you bring awareness to what you're directly experiencing via your senses, or to your state of mind via your thoughts and emotions, you're being mindful. And there's growing research showing that when you train your brain to be mindful, you're actually remodeling the physical structure of your brain. The goal of mindfulness is to wake up to the inner workings of our mental, emotional, and physical processes. Meditation is exploring. It's not a fixed destination. Your head doesn't become vacuumed free of thought, utterly undistracted. It's a special place where each and every moment is momentous. When we meditate we venture into the workings of our minds: our sensations (air blowing on our skin or a harsh smell wafting into the room), our emotions (love this, hate that, crave this, loathe that) and thoughts (wouldn't it be weird to see an elephant playing Mindfulness meditation asks us to suspend judgment and unleash our natural curiosity about the workings of the mind, approaching our experience with warmth and kindness, to ourselves and others. Mindfulness is available to us in every moment, whether through meditations and body scans, or mindful moment practices like taking time to pause and breathe when the phone rings instead of rushing to answer it.

But as mindfulness urges us to pay more attention, it's worth asking: What can our interior life teach us? [Read More ](https://www.mindful.org/why-we-talk-to-ourselves-the-science-of-your-internal-monologue/) Mindfulness helps us put some space between ourselves and our reactions, breaking down our conditioned responses. [Here's how to tune into mindfulness](https://www.mindful.org/how-to-practice-mindfulness/) throughout the day: That's the practice.

Even if you only come back once, that's okay. As you spend time practicing mindfulness, you'll probably find yourself feeling kinder, calmer, and more patient.
