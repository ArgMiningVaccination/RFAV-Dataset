This crystal rock deodorant leaves an invisible layer of pure salt minerals on the skin's surface which helps regulate the body's natural perspiration. Due to its purifying ingredients and astringents it works as a natural deodorant. - Fragrance free / unisex. - Sensitive skin friendly. - Use anywhere on the body to prevent odour. - Not tested on animals. Used for centuries as a natural astringent and for its natural anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. This naturally occurring mineral salt is also used as a water purifier in many parts of the world. How does it work? By wetting the crystal deodorant stone and smoothing it under your arm, an invisible salt film sits on the surface of the skin. It doesn't stop you from sweating, but it does keep odor-forming microbes at bay. Method: Dampen crystal before use. We like to run it under the tap or apply directly to damp skin after showering. For best results apply to freshly washed skin. Care: Be careful not to drop as the crystal may crack or break if it hits concrete or tile. If you do damage your crystal be sure to check for any sharp edges before using it again. Any sharp edges will smooth out over time or you can use sand paper to sand smooth again. Ingredients: Naturally occurring potassium alum. No alcohols, no aluminium chlorohydrate, no aluminium chlorohydroxide and no parabens. 95g stone crystal wrapped in recycled paper. "}
