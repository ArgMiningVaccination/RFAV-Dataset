This one topic (underlying problem) has kept popping up, whether I was seeing someone with low back problems or sciatica. Whether I was correcting mid and upper back pain, tension in the shoulders, neck pain, shoulder and arm pains, carpal tunnel syndrome, numbness and tingling in the arms and hands, or headache. What is one common denominator of all of these?? These symptoms may be showing up while driving, watching TV, reading, or just lying in bed. They may be showing up while using smartphones and laptops while eating meals or doing dishes. These symptoms have been interrupting people's sleep and giving them pain throughout the night. Basically, these daily symptoms disturb lives across the board. No matter the complaint there is one underlying common theme. The one topic, the major issue that ties all these complaints together is the \"work from home set up\"! Since being forced to stay home since the beginning of the pandemic so many people have had to shift the majority of the work time from their office to their home. So many people have moved from their ergonomically correct office workspace to their home-based laptop set up. And it has not been pretty! My brother told me how his company bought close to five hundred laptops for all their employees to be able to securely work from home. Have you had to do any work on a laptop recently for an extended period of time?? It is brutal. I had a recent experience with this. A typical workday for me is that I'm on my feet in and out of rooms, checking and adjusting spines. I have some computers I can use while standing and others while seated on a stool. An average day inside the clinic is about 8000 steps for me. However, recently I was home with the kids and I sat with them during their home-based schooling- all of us at the kitchen table. I was doing my work while they were doing theirs. They were finished and I kept going...I was putting in the hours at the laptop. After a full day of it, I was HURTING. My neck, my shoulders hurt and I even got a wicked headache. I never get headaches, ever! This was just one single day of it. I can't even imagine doing this day in day out... For most people working from home means... - gone is the multi-adjustable modern office work chair - and in the one-size uncomfortable dining room chair - gone is the wonderfully oversized external monitors - and in the single 12-14 screens. - gone is the properly spaced distances for optimal ergonomics - and in the turtle-necked posture. - gone is the convertible stand-up/sit-down hydraulic desk - and in the \"hey, move breakfast aside at the kitchen table\" - gone is the ability to just leave the office and leave work for the day behind. Where are you going to go? You are already there. No transition between work and home life. The struggle is real! I'm having conversations around this topic with different people in my clinic 5-6 times a day. Have you heard of the terms text neck, tech neck, turtle posture, or hunchback? This is a perfect illustration depicting the evolution of mankind from hunched over caveman to modern upright human back to hunchbacked computer worker. The younger generation who have been on smartphones, tablets, laptops in their entire lives suffer from this bad posture epidemic the most! I genuinely fear for the amount of stress they have been experiencing and what that is doing to their health and their spines long term. Chiropractically speaking, prolonged bad posture is causing subluxations in the spine. Subluxations will cause further stress on the nervous system, accelerate degeneration, and have really bad effects on overall health. We really break this whole concept down in our online program called The Spinal Code. There is everything in this course from self-assessments and workstation check-ups to all of the corrective exercises needed to get rid of symptoms, reverse these problems, and work towards optimal posture. Super excited to be bringing you this self-help, DIY program online that will be launching soon As always, if you know someone who this information is relevant to go ahead and share it with them. Let's bring awareness together of how important to be mindful about daily, repetitive motions, and about the effect of posture on our overall health! As a doctor of chiropractic, I say this is a new epidemic of bad posture. "}
