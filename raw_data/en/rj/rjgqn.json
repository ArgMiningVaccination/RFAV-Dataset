Iyer,1Dennis L. Kasper,2Richard S. Blumberg1* Microbial colonization of mucosal tissues during infancy plays an instrumental role in the development and education of the host mammalian immune system. Theseearly-life events can have long-standing consequences: facilitating tolerance to environmental exposures or contributing to the development of disease in later life, including inflammatory bowel disease, allergy, and asthma. Recent studies have begunto define a critical period during early development in which disruption of optimalhost-commensal interactions can lead to persistent and in some cases irreversible defects in the development and training of specific immune subsets. Here, we discuss the role of early-life education of the immune system during this \"window of opportunity, \" when microbial colonization has a potentially critical impact on human healthand disease. The commensal microbiota, which widely colonize the body, strongly influence the host immune system. Most of the internal and external surfaces of a mammals 'body during adult life \u2014including the gastrointes- tinal tract, skin, and oral mucosa\u2014 are heavily colonized by microbiota, with the largest con-gregation of organisms contained within the co-lon. The human body was recently estimated to be composed of 3 \u00d7 10 13eukaryotic cells and 4 \u00d7 1013colonizing bacteria (1 ). The exposure of the mammal to microbiota begins in utero and ex- pands rapidly after birth. For example, mater- nal gut bacteria can be detected in the amniotic fluid of pregnant mice ( 2), and bacteria can be isolated in the meconium from preterm human babies ( 3). After birth, the composition of mi- crobiota is initially derived from opportunistic colonization by the first types of bacteria towhich a baby is exposed in his or her environ- ment, which together with other environmental factors, such as diet, may substantially affect theentry of subsequent microbial species into thevarious mucosal niches. As such, the mode of delivery and subsequent environmental expo- sures greatly influence the composition of themicrobiota in the infant ( 4). The microbiota composition of an adult may therefore in part reflect the history of exposure to microbes and environmental factors in early life. This conceptis supported by experiments with mice ( 5,6) and familial studies in humans ( 7) that indi- cate that the environment in early life mayaccount for, at least in part, microbial compo-sition in the adult. These events and their im- mune consequences are perhaps most important during the first year of life, when the microbialcomposition is highly variable ( 8), with progres-sive stabilization to an adult-like communitystructure after 3 years of age ( 9). The instability of the microbiota during early life makes thecommunity structure of microbiota during thistime more sensitive to environmental incur- sions ( 10). It is now increasingly clear that early- life colonization also coincides with a potentially time-limited period during which the immunesystem is permissive to microbial instruction. Further, emerging evidence suggests that the immune influences induced by the microbiotaduring this early period of life may be durable,creating a \"window of opportunity \"for proper (or improper) immune e ducation to occur and resistance (or susceptibility) to disease in laterlife. This Review focuses on these issues and the recent evidence in support of this concept. Evidence that the microbiota influences the immune system: Lessons fromgerm-free animal studies The use of germ-free (GF) animals allowed for development of the concept that the microbiotainfluences the immune system. In 1885, Louis Pasteur first proposed the generation of ani- mals deprived of common microorganisms tounderstand the relationship between microbesand their host ( 11). Ten years later, Nuttall and Thierfelder used guinea pigs to produce the firstGF animals by means of cesarean section ( 12). It took around another 50 years, however, until enough was known about the nutrition of new- born animals to enable production of the firstGF rats ( 13) and mice ( 14). The first compari- sons of GF rodents with \"microbiota-colonized animals \"resulted in the observation that there were gross physiological differences betweenGF and the specific pathogen -free (SPF) state, including an enlarged cecum, principally due to an accumulation of undegraded mucus ( 15), and reduced gastrointestinal motility ( 16), due to the loss of the critical digestive functions ofthe inhabiting microbiota. In parallel, GF ro- dents display an aberrant intestinal epithelialcell (IEC) morphology that includes longer villiand shorter crypts in comparison with that ob-served in conventionalized ( 17) and re- duced antimicrobial peptides ( 18,19). Of most relevance, the absence of commensals has pro- found effects on the structural and functional development of the immune system, includingbut not limited to defects in lymphoid tissue development within the spleen, thymus, and lymph node ( 20,21). Moreover, these structural abnormalities were most striking near the mu-cosal interface, suggesting that interactions with specific communities of microbes directly mod- ulate development of these gut-associated lymph- oid structures (GALTs). For instance, a type called isolated lymphoid folli- cles (ILFs) are minimally present in the absence of microbiota in the small intestine but not thecolon ( 22-24). In addition, GF animals contain smaller Peyer 's patches (PPs) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) ( 23). Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the microbiota partic-ipates in the maturation of the immune system and suggests that specific events in association with the process of microbial colonization maybe important in the development of a normalimmune system in a healthy individual. Microbial colonization modulates early development of the immune system inmucosal tissues Colonization of mucosal surfaces is characterized by fluctuating changes in microbial diversityduring the first few years of life, until reaching a point of equilibrium that remains relatively stable throughout adulthood in the absence ofenvironmental insults ( 25). In association with this, the early-life ecological succession of mu- cosal colonization occurs concomitantly with the development, expansion, and education ofthe mucosal immune system. It therefore followsthat immune maturation is likely influenced di- rectly and/or indirectly by the presence of com- mensal microbes ( 26,27). The postnatal period thus represents a potentially critical time in which early-life microbial exposures can have profound influences on the morphological andfunctional development of the immune system.Neonatal immune cells differ in function from adult immune cells so that they preferentially develop tolerance in response to antigen expo-sure in a process that still remains to be definedbut does not involve an intrinsic property of the T cell but rather the environment in which the T cell develops ( 28-30). Neonatal immune cells therefore learn to tolerate the new envi-ronment experienced after birth, such as the commensal microbiota. These concepts have been experimentally tested by varying the timeof microbiota introduction into GF animals and observing the changes in immune development and/or function. Although most abnormalities in GF animals are age-independent and can be corrected by introducing commensals at any age ( 31), the ability to restore a few cellular defects that oc- cur in the absence of microbiota is restrictedto a short time interval in early life and thus is SCIENCE sciencemag.org 29 APRIL 2016 \u007fVOL 352 ISSUE 6285 539 1Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Endoscopy, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women 's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.2Division of Immunology, Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. *Corresponding author.

Consistent with this, GF mice conventionalized during adult life possess adifferent transcriptional profile in the jejunumand colon in comparison with conventionally raised SPF mice, suggesting that if colonization does not occur during a critical \"window of opportunity, \"intestinal immune development cannot be fully achieved in the adult ( 32). This supports the notion that early exposure to mi-crobes may have durable consequences for thehost that may extend into adult life. As a cor- ollary, in the absence of appropriate microbial exposures in early life, the immune consequencesmay elicit irreversible and potentially deleterious implications for the host. Age-independent influences T cell subsetsGF animals exhibit major defects in the devel-opment of primary and secondary lymphoid organs \u2014including the GALT, spleen, and thymus \u2014 which is associated with a decreased frequency of CD4 +and CD8+intestinal T cell subsets as well as reduced numbers of intraepithelial lympho-cytes that express the abT cell receptor (TCR) (33). Normalization of these morphological and cellular defects in abT cells can be achieved by reintroducing standard mouse or human micro-biota in adult mice ( 33-36). Furthermore, char- acterization of the TCR repertoire in intestinaltissues at the time of initial commensalization suggests an influx of polyclonal TCR- ab +Tc e l l s early in life that lose diversity and revert to an oligoclonal state in the adult ( 37). To address this, subsequent studies comparing colonizedand monocolonized mice with GF animals haveb e g u nt oc l a r i f yt h er o l eo fd i s t i n c tc o m m e n s a lbacterial communities in modulating specificT cell effects. GF mice are typically T helper 2(T H2)-skewed. A balancing of systemic T H1a n d TH2 cells is observed after monocolonization of GF mice with Bacteroides fragilis that is due to a single microbial molecule, polysaccharide A(PSA) ( 38). In another example, segmented fila- mentous bacteria (SFB) play a key role in intes- tinal T Hcell responses and rat microbiota or monocoloni- zation with SFB, however, only partially restores CD4+and CD8+Tc e l ln u m b e r s ,s u g g e s t i n gt h a t a diverse microbial population is necessary to restore a fully mature immune system in theadult ( 39). Particular bacterial populations havebeen linked to the development of specific T ef-fector subsets, such as T H17 cells, a potent source of interleukin-17 (IL-17) that plays an importantrole in the maintenance of mucosal barrier in- t e g r i t ya n dc l e a r a n c eo fp a t h o g e n si nt h et i s s u e s . T H17 development is dependent on microbiota and is absent in the small intestine of GF ani- mals. T H17 cells can be restored in GF adult mice through colonization with standard mouse micro- biota or SFB but not others ( 41). Consequently, SFB colonization confers enhanced protection compared with GF animals after infection with the bacterial pathogen Citrobacter rodentium , which is a direct result of enrichment of T H17 cells in the small bowel ( 41). 540 29 APRIL 2016 \u007fVOL 352 ISSUE 6285 SCIENCE Germ-free colonA of opportunity2 weeks AdultB. frag B. fragSPT B. fragSPTSusceptibility to colitis Susceptibility to colitis Healthy colon Healthy colon Susceptibility to colitis Germ-free lungB CXCL16 dependent B. frag B. fragSusceptibility to asthma Susceptibility to asthma Healthy lung Susceptibility to asthma Germ-free Standard lacking iNKT cell colonization is regulated by the microbiota during early life and influences susceptibility to colitis and asthma later in life.(A) iNKT cells migrate from the thymus to the colon during the first weeks of life.Their abnormalaccumulation in the colon of GF mice leads tolater-life susceptibility to oxazolone-induced colitis.Conventionalization with a microbiota or monocolonization with B. fragilis (B. frag ) deficient in sphingolipids ( B. frag DSPT) during the window of opportunity restores colonic iNKT cell numbers and abrogates the increased susceptibility to colitis.

GF mouse colon, but not small intestine, con-tains decreased T regcells, which can be normal- ized conventionalization and monocolonization with certain Clostridium spe- cies or a variety of intestinal microbes, regardless of age ( 44,45). B cells B cells are essential to the immune system as a source of the five different isotypes of function-ally distinct antibodies: IgA, IgE, IgG, IgD, and IgM. GF mice exhibit normal numbers and phe- notypic maturation of B cells. However, theyexhibit a general defect in the production of IgAand IgG1 antibodies in mucosal and nonmucosal organs that can be normalized after conven- tionalization by microbiota ( 31). Consistent with this, GF mice possess few IgA-expressing B cells in the small intestine. This decrease in IgA is likely due to ILF deficiency. Conventionalizationof adult GF mice thus restores ILF numbersand rescues IgA production by B cells in the small intestine ( 31,46) .T h i sm a yb et h r o u g h dendritic cells that do not migrate outside of intestinal tissues and retain live microorgan-isms for prolonged periods of time, which allows them the ability to induce IgA expres- sion in the adult mouse intestine ( 47). Innate lymphoid cells Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) represent lymphoid cells with innate immune function that lack aBo rTc e l lr e c e p t o r( 48). Conflicting results sur- round our understanding of ILC regulation bymicrobiota. Natural killer (NK) cells (ILC group 1)exhibit phenotypic evidence of activa-tion in nonmucosal organs of GF mice, a process that is orchestrated by mononuclear phagocytes in a Toll-like receptor (TLR) -dependent manner and can be reversed through the colonization of adult mice with a standard microbiota ( 49). It has also been shown that GF mice display im- paired development of Nkp46 +RAR-related or- phan receptor -gt( R O R gt)-dependent group 3 ILCs ( 50) and decreased expression of IL-22 by these cells, an important cytokine in epithelialresponses to microbes in the small intestine(50,51). However, another study has shown that GF mice exhibit no change in the numbers ofNkp46 +ROR gt-dependent ILCs and ( 52,53). In either case, dysregulation of IL-22 expression in GF mice can be normalizedby means of standard microbiota convention-alization in adult mice ( 50,52). Despite these inconsistencies, it is clear that microbiota regu-late ILCs in an age-independent manner. Epithelial cells IECs are found at the interface between the lumenal microbiota and immune system in themucosa and play an increasingly recognizedrole in a variety of immune functions ( 54). Oneof the functions of IECs is to produce anti-microbial peptides. RegIII gis a secreted C-type lectin that regulates the interaction betweenmicrobiota and the host through its antibac- terial activity on Gram-positive microbes and is mainly expressed by Paneth cells at the baseof the crypts of Lieberkuhn in the small in- testine. In GF mice, IECs exhibit decreased ex- pression of RegIII gthat can be rescued after colonization 55)o r monocolonization with Bacteroides intestine and colon ( 56). RegIII g expression is also regulated t-dependent ILC3 b(RELM b) is a secreted protein highly expressed in the intestinal tract and gob-let cells in particular. In GF mice, RELM bexpres- sion by goblet cells is strongly decreased whencompared with that in SPF mice but can be res- cued after colonization w ith standard microbiota (58). RELM bcan regulate the expression of in- flammatory cytokines through intestinal macro-phages influencing host r esponses to artificially induced colitis ( 59). Separately, GF mice exhibit a lower expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II on IECs that can be res- cued through colonization with microbiota, an interferon- g-dependent event ( 60).

Current studies also sugge st that conventionali- zation of GF adult animals leads to substantialchanges in gene expression associated with IECs(62). In future studies, it will be interesting to examine the age dependency of these effects andthe manner in which they alter epithelial expres-sion of factors well known to play an importantrole in epithelial cell -immune interactions such as IL-25, transforming growth factor -b(TGF- b), B cell activating factor a and thymic stromallymphopoietin iNKT in colon and lung Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells express an invariant TCR- achain and a diverse array of TCR- bchains and recognize endogenous and exogenous (bacterial) lipid antigens pre- sented by CD1d, a MHC class I -like molecule (63). In GF animals, iNKT cells are decreased in peripheral tissues such as the spleen and liver and are hyporesponsive to lipid antigen stim- ulation, which is normalized by tion with bacteria expressing iNKT antigens inadult mice ( 64).

This exaggerated accumulation of iNKT cells and hyperresponsiveness to environmentaltriggers of iNKT cells that induce colitis can benormalized through colonization of GF mice with standard microbiota, Bacteroides fragilis monocolonization, or treatment with B. fragilis - derived sphingolipid antigens during the first 2 weeks of life but not thereafter (Fig. 1A) ( 65,66). iNKT cell accumulation in the lung and suscep-tibility to asthma of GF mice can be rescued bycolonization with standard microbiota but notby monocolonization with B. fragilis during the first 2 weeks of life (Fig. 1B). These studies have revealed at least two non- mutually exclusive mechanisms by which themicrobiota can modulate iNKT frequency in the colon and lung. Accumulation of iNKT cells in the colon in GF animals is associated with ele-vated levels of the chemokine ligand CXCL16, whose expression is normalized by convention- alization during this cri tical 2-week time period in a pathway dependent on micro-biota-induced epigenetic changes of the Cxcl16 gene ( 65). In contrast, normalization of iNKT cell frequen- cy by the human commensal B. fragilis appears to involve an in- hibition of iNKT cell proliferationand expansion in early life throughB. fragilis -derived sphingolipids t h a ta r ei n h i b i t o r y( 66). It is par- ticularly interesting that the effectsof intestinal B. fragilis coloniza- tion is tissue-specific because it is restricted to the colon, strongly supporting the idea that specificmicrobes and potentially signalscan regulate iNKT recruitment and p r o l i f e r a t i o ni nd i s t i n c to r g a n s . B cells and IgE IgE are antibodies produced by B cells that play a pivotal role in re-sponse to allergens and immunityto pathogens. Whereas IgA and IgG1 levels are decreased in GF mice, a recent study showed that GF micehave elevated levels of serum IgEafter weaning (~30 days) because of enhanced rates of B cell isotype class switching to IgE in PPs andMLNs ( 67). Elevated IgE levels in GF animals was associated with exaggerated responses to orally in- duced systemic anaphylaxis ( 67). Hyper-IgE levels in GF mice serum are associated with a concomitant increase in IL-4 production in PPs and MLNs and are de-pendent on CD4 +T cells. Colonization of GF mice with standard microbiota from birth to 4 weeks of age but not thereafter normalizes the IgE lev- els in adults, which is consistent with a regu-lation of IgE production by the microbiota that isspecific to this time frame (Fig. 2). IgE produc-tion in adult mice is dependent on intestinalbacterial diversity in neonates rather than on colonization with specific bacterial species sothat a low diversity of microbiota is not sufficient to normalize IgE levels during early life. T regcells in lung and skin Exposure to house dust mite (HDM) antigen \u2014 which possesses CD1d-restricted antigens for iNKT cells ( 68), during the first 2 weeks of life, but not thereafter \u2014induces a helios-negative (presumably induced) subset of T regcells from conventional CD4+T cells in the lung ( 69). Con- sequently, initial HDM exposure during adultlife results in increased AHR relative to that ob- served when HDM exposure first occurs in early life. Mechanistically, the allergen-induced devel-opment of the helios-negative T regcells in early life is dependent on micro biota and involves the expression of the immune checkpoint moleculeprogrammed cell death protein 1 (PD1) on the Tcell and PD-L1 on dendritic cells so that early-life blockade of PD-L1 abrogates the expansion of the helios-negative T regcell and increased asthma upon HDM exposure. Thus, a 2-week window ofopportunity exists in which allergen exposure can induce a specific group of T regcells and pro- tection from asthma. Consistent with a prevalent role of microbiota in the regulation of lung aller- gic disease during early life, antibiotic treatment of mice during early life enhances susceptibilityto allergic asthma ( 6).A similar age-restricted regulation of T reg cells also exists in skin. Colonization of micewith a commensal skin bacterial strain duringthe first 2 weeks of life, but not thereafter, induces accumulation of activated T regcells in the skin that are derived from the thymus and which maintain tolerance to commensal de- rived antigens in the adult ( 70). When coloni- zation is initiated in adult mice after the time of weaning, such commensal antigen-specifictolerance is not initiated (Fig. 3). Further, the accumulation of activated T regcells during this early-life period appears to be specific to the skin and is not observed in the intestinal lam-ina propria. Antibiotic treatment in neonatal mice can induce long-term modification of mi- crobial composition of the skin and susceptibilityto psoriasis development in adulthood, whichis associated with increased IL-22 -producing gd T cells ( 71). Regulation of thymically derived and induced T regcells by microbiota during early life therefore appears to be tissue-specific, suggest- ing that even the same cell type (such as T reg)i s under the influence of distinct organ-specific mechanisms. Epithelial cells The establishment of tolerance dur- ing the neonatal period can be reg-ulated by non-immune cells. As an example, TLR signaling is specifi- cally down-regulated during thefirst 2 weeks of life in mouse IECs but not thereafter ( 72,73). This ren- ders epithelial cells hyporesponsive to TLR stimuli such as lipopolysac-charide derived from Gram-negative bacteria. This neonatal tolerance is dependent on TLR4 and the modeof birth delivery. Indeed, IECs fromcesarean-born neonates do not down-regulate TLR signaling and are more prone to develop epithelialdamage, suggesting an important role of specific types of microbial exposure in the development ofepithelial tolerance. These studiesemphasize the important potential role played by epithelial cells in the tolerance pathways that are estab-lished during early life. Erythrocytes in spleen A small subset of erythrocytes ex- press the transferrin receptor CD71.CD71 +erythrocytes are enriched in spleen from birth to 2 weeks ofage and diminished in adult life(74). Their development is inde- pendent of microbiota; similar numbers areobserved in GF and SPF mice. However, theyfunction in suppressing (for example, Listeria mono- inhibition leads to increased basal expres-sion levels of the inflammatory cytokine tumornecrosis factor in intestinal myeloid cells in 542 29 APRIL 2016 \u007fVOL 352 ISSUE 6285 sciencemag.org SCIENCE Birth Window of opportunityTreg cell colonization\"Activated\" Treg cell colonization 2 weeks AdultSkinTo l e ra n c e to markedcommensalantigen No toleranceto marked commensal antigen Commensal microbiota containing antigenExposure to markedcommensal antigen Fig. 3.

Colonization of adult animals with the same microbiota containing the marked commensal microbiota (red triangle) does not lead to T reg cell accumulation in the skin or establish immune tolerance.MICROBIOME on January 4, 2017 http://science.sciencemag.org/ Downloaded from neonates maintained under SPF conditions. These studies show that not only do microbialexposures regulate immune development duringearly life, but also that the host maintains crit- ical and specific mechanistic pathways that regulate host response to microbes during thiscritical period of life. Early-life perturbations of microbiota and their relationship to human disease Because microbe-immune interactions appear to play an important role in early-life develop- ment of the immune system and when disruptedmay result in potentially persistent immune ab-normalities, it is worth considering whether early-life exposure to microbes may affect later- life susceptibility to disease. There is emergingevidence to support this hypothesis. Children exposed to farm environments have a decreased risk for the development of allergicdisease, possibly through mechanisms that in-volve the ubiquitin-modifying 75,76). pregnan-cy modulates immune responses and protectsagainst asthma in a mother 's offspring ( 77). This protective effect can be correlated with in- creased T regcell activity in the infant. Although it is not firmly proven, one of the plausible explanations for the protective effect of early-life farm exposure is the role of microbiota be- cause individuals exposed to a farm environment possess different micro bial diversity compared with other lifestyles ( 78). In an opposite manner, exposure to antibiotics is associated with persist-ent changes in microbial composition in studiesperformed in human adults ( 79-81)t h a tm a y potentially apply to early periods of life ( 82). As an example, antibiotic use within the first 6months of life is associated with an increasedsusceptibility to allergy and asthma at 6 yearsof age ( 83). Another study has shown that an- tibiotic exposure during the first year of life isassociated with the development of wheezingand eczema at 8 years of age, even after taking into account early-life r espiratory infections ( 84). In parallel, exposure to antibiotics in childhood, and especially during the first year of life, is as-sociated with an increased risk for development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ( 85,86). Antibiotic exposure during the first year of life is also associated with increased susceptibilityto being overweight and developing central adi- posity and may lead to increased development of type 2 diabetes mellitus later in life ( 87,88). Moreover, a recent study has shown that mi-crobiota composition shifts occur in the infant before development of type 1 diabetes mellitus (89). Consistent with this, early-life exposure of female NOD mice to microbiota from male NOD mice can confer protection against diabetes mel- litus in a testosterone-dependent pathway ( 90). Children born by means of cesarean section havean altered microbiota composition and may be more susceptible to obesity, type 1 diabetes mellitus, allergy, and asthma during childhoodand adult life ( 91-93). The mechanistic basis for this latter example is unclear and may involvenumerous factors, including the exposure toantibiotics with this intervention. Together, these studies support an indirect association between perturbations of microbial composition during early life and development of disease later in life. This potential associa-tion is investigated in a recent clinical study of children with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), which mouse models suggest is an iNKT cell - mediated disease ( 94). In this example, young children (<6 years of age) with EoE exhibited increased transcrip tional levels of TCR iNKT cells), CD1d, and CXCL16 in the esophagi, which was normalized by a dietary intervention to treat the EoE, but not in those who did not respond to the therapy ( 95). Retrospective data suggested that those with in- creased iNKT cell -associated transcripts were exposed in early life to antibiotics ( 95). Breast milk contains proteins, maternal bacte- ria, and nutrients important for the develop-ment of the newborn that may also participate in the establishment of the neonatal micro- environment ( 96,97). This includes the neonatal immune system given the protective effects ofbreastfeeding on the development of obesity or IBD in adult life ( 98,99). However, the specific maternal factors, including microbes and the mechanisms involved, remain to be identified. Concluding remarks The mucosal tissues of the host are a highly dy- namic set of structures that reside at the inter- face between the external world and the internal immune and nonimmune tissues. These sur-faces are also a critical site of microbial com-mensalism that plays a critical role in defining the morphology and function of the host and are, like the host that they serve, under the in-fluence of a variety of environmental factors. Itis becoming increasingly clear that the ordered establishment of this interface is critically impor- tant to the proper development of the immunesystem and likely the microbiota themselves. Moreover, there has been a recent recognition that a number of the critical immune mechanismsthat determine the main tenance of homeostasis and tolerance to environmental exposures at this interface are determined by a set of poorly defined microbial-host interactions that occurduring a narrow time frame contained withinthe earliest days of life. This specifically has lead to the notion of a \"window of opportunity, \"in which particular microbial exposures during early life determine specific immune events thatare durably imprinted, or not. This time frame correlates with the suckling period of rodents, whose relation to human development remainsto be defined. A recent study nicely demonstrates that such early-life influences by the microbiota may even be evident during gestation, in thatmicrobial colonization during pregnancy regu-lates the number of specific innate immune cells and their activity in the offspring (100 ). This pro- cess is dependent on microbially induced, ma- ternal antibodies specific for microbial-derivedmolecules that are present in the milk andtransferred to the neonate during the periodof suckling. In their totality, these insights haveprofound implications for human disease bysuggesting that disease risk may begin at the earliest days of life, including the antenatal pe- riod.

Blaser1,2,3 Anti-infectives, including antibiotics, are essentially different from all other drugs; they not only affect the individual to whom they are given but also the entire community, through selection for resistance to their own action. Thus, their use resides at the intersection of personal and public health. Antibiotics can be likened to a four-edged sword against bacteria. The first two edge s of the antibiotic sword were identified immediately after their discovery and deployment in that they not only benefit anindividual in treating their infection but also benefit the community in preventing thespread of that infectious agent. The third edge was already recognized by AlexanderFleming in 1945 in his Nobel acceptance sp eech, which warned about the cost to the community of antibiotic resistance that w ould inevitably evolve and be selected for during clinical practice. We have seen this cost mount up, as resistance curtails orprecludes the activities of some of our most effective drugs for clinically important infections. But the fourth edge of the anti biotic sword remained unappreciated until recently, i.e., the cost that an antibiotic exerts on an individual 's own health via the collateral damage of the drug on bacteria that normally live on or in healthy humans: our microbiota. These organisms, their gen es, metabolites, and interactions with one another, as well as with their host colle ctively, represent our microbiome. Our relationship with these symbiotic bacteria is especially important during the early yearsof life, when the adult microbiome has not yet formed. For 70 years, antibiotics have been a pillar of medicine and are being used worldwide on an enormous scale. In many countries, anti-biotic use exceeds one course per capita peryear. In 2010, the top seven antibiotic classes were consumed in an estimated 70 billion individ-ual doses, which equates to about 10 pills, capsules,or teaspoons for every man, woman, and child on earth (1 ), an annual rate that appears to be rising. This magnitude of use is based at least in part on the perception, among both health professionalsand the public, that antibiotics are completely safe. We all are aware of mild, self-limited problems, such as rashes and drug reactions, and doctorsknow about serious but very rare side effects, yetat a functional level, most of us consider these risks so close to zero that they do not usually fac- tor into the equation about use. There also is thecost of antibiotic resistance, but because it pre-dominantly affects the community rather than the treated individual, its avoidance does not usually affect clinical judgments about whetheror not treatment should be given. Parents would rather have their ill child treated with a drug they s e ea ss a f ea n de f f e c t i v et h a nw o r r ya b o u tt h ei m -pact of that single course on the future of human-kind, and their doctors generally agree. However, this construct of essentially complete personal safety is illusory . Shortly after antibioticsb e g a nt ob eu s e dt ot r e a ti l lp e o p l ea n da n i m a l s , farmers discovered that adding low doses of anti- biotics to the food or water of their livestock wouldpromote their growth; the earlier in life the expo-sure began, the more profound the effect ( 2). This observation alone provides an important clue thatantibiotic exposure affects metabolic development.Antibiotic use has been widespread because it leads to growth promotion and, therefore, increased profit for farmers. But does this massive decades-long worldwide \"experiment\" on the farm teach us anything about human health? Is it possible that the antibiotics that we give our children ear- ly in life to treat their infections \u2014whether severe (uncommon) or mild (very common) \u2014are influ- encing a critical window in the development of their own metabolism? In recent years, scientists have been exploring this question, with mostly consistent results. Ob- servational, clinical, and epidemiologic studies focused on young children are providing a growing body of evidence that antibiotic exposure is asso-ciated with increased risk for a variety of diseases including obesity, types 1 and 2 diabetes, inflam- matory bowel diseases, for examples]. Experimen- tal models are providing increasing evidence that these associations are not just correlative but are causal. Studies in mice have found that antibioticexposure, by disrupting the development of theearly-life microbiome, which often causes loss of species and strain diversity ( i.e., biodiversity loss), l e a d st om e t a b o l i cp e r t u r b a t i o n st h a ta f f e c ta d i - posity and bone growth and alter normal im- munologic development ( 5,6). A variety of evidence indicates that the risks appear greatest for young children (7 ).
