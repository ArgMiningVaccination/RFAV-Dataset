Older methods of teaching, including the ever-present narrated PowerPoint presentations, are not optimally meeting the needs of NPM fellowship trainees and create a significant faculty time burden to create and/or update. At the fall 2016 ONTPD meeting, the National Neonatology Curriculum Committee (NNCC) was formed by like- minded program directors and associate program directors to address shared concerns surrounding the development, maintenance, implementation, and effectiveness of educational materials for NPM fellowship training. The NNCC seeks to streamline educational efforts nationally by developing standardized, high-quality, peer-reviewed educational materials to meet ABP educational mandates. The NNCC has two missions: (1) Improve the quality, consistency, and efficiency of neonatology education by creating freely accessible, peer-reviewed, adult learning-grounded, ABP content-focused educational materials. (2) Create a collaborative of academic educators who will advance the science of teaching and learning to improve the quality of neonatal care. The NNCC is currently developing a physiology curriculum using flipped classroom (FC) methodology. FC is an educational strategy aligned with adult learning theory that is associated with improved learner acceptance, engagement, satisfaction, and knowledge acquisition. The National Neonatology Curriculum employs pre-class online videos and in-class faculty-facilitated group Printing and mailing of this issue supported through a grant from Abbott Nutrition. TThe National Neonatology Curriculum - An Introduction and Work-In Progress Report Continued from Page 1 discussions of clinical cases highlighting physiologic concepts taught in the videos. Rather than a passive didactic lecture, class time is spent actively analyzing and applying learned concepts to clinical cases, providing clinical context and relevance of physiological principles. In the FC, active learner engagement promotes development of higher level cognitive skills which are critical for lifelong learning in medicine. Our pilot data, collected from five participating institutions and published in 2018 (PMID 30087455), showed that 91% of fellows felt that the FC modules were superior or far superior to their traditional didactic activities. Both learners and educators found the educational materials to be relevant and the class discussions engaging. Learners reported compliance with completion of pre-class activities and educators noted a decrease in time required to prepare for class. Currently, a randomized controlled trial, which enrolled 63 US NPM fellowship programs and >500 fellows, is comparing knowledge retention and learner/educator preference for FCs versus standardized didactic lectures. This RCT will complete data collection in September 2019. Additional efforts are underway to identify best practices in FC facilitation to aid faculty with engaging in and adopting this educational modality. The National Curriculum educational materials are freely available online at www.mededonthego.com (search term \"Neo Flip\"). Each physiology topic contains short videos as well as a downloadable transcript, slide set narrated by a neonatologist, and FC learner and facilitator guides. To date, the NNCC has published 18 respiratory physiology modules. Educational materials covering GI/Bilirubin topics currently being used in the RCT will be made publicly available in October 2019. MFM and ECMO materials are under development and recruitment for Neurology, Nutrition, Genetics, QI, Nephrology, and Neurodevelopment topics is starting. A complementary simulation curriculum is also under development to reinforce important physiological concepts for learners and is expected to be available fall of 2019. The NNCC intends to provide educational materials covering all areas of the ABP NPM Educational Content Outline over the next few years and interested neonatologists are always welcome to join the effort. Additional information is available on the ONTPD's website. The NNCC is especially grateful for the support of the Executive Committees of ONTPD and SoNPM. The NNCC has partnered with NeoReviews and Drs. Dara Brodsky and Camilia Martin to use some of their published educational materials to augment the National Curriculum. Members of the NNCC are Heather French (Co-Chair), Megan Gray (Co-Chair), Rita Dadiz (Vice Chair), Maria Gillam-Krakauer (Vice Chair), Susan Izatt (Vice Chair), Liz Bonachea, Melissa Carbajal, Patty Chess, Alison Lindsay Johnston, Heidi Arias-Shah. NNCC welcomes faculty and mentored fellows interested in authoring or editing modules to contact its Co-Chairs Dr. Heather French (frenchh@email.chop.edu) or Dr. Megan Gray (graym1@uw.edu) with specific content areas of interest/expertise. This is an excellent opportunity for national education involvement and scholarship.

This meeting provides a forum for program directors to discuss innovative scholarly activity opportunities for trainees. We heard updates related to research in large network and quality improvement databases (Children's Hospital Neonatal Database and Vermont Oxford Network), simulation research (InSpire) and global health. We will continue some of these discussions during our annual meeting at the AAP NCE in New Orleans this fall. Our ONTPD sub-committees remain active and continue to work on initiatives to support our Program Directors/Associate Program Directors (PD/APDs): National Curriculum (Chair Heather French) This committee has been very active in the development of curriculum using the flipped classroom approach including a randomized control trial including many neonatal fellowship programs. Please see a complete update in a separate article in this SoNPM Newsletter. Standard Forms Committee (Chair Heidi Karpen) Standard forms (evaluation, scholarship oversight review, etc.) that are useful for PD/APDs will continue to be uploaded to the ONTPD website. Please email Heidi Karpen (Heidi.karpen@emory.edu) if you have forms that you think would be useful to other program directors. Program Director and Associate Program Director Mentorship Committee (Chairs Melissa Carbajal and Cathy Bendel) More than 20 mentors have been paired with mentee neonatal fellowship PDs. If you are interested in serving as a mentor or would like to be paired with a mentor, please contact Melissa Carbajal (mmcarbaj@bcm.edu). Website Committee (Chair Patrick Myers) We continue to update the ONTPD website, optimizing the resources for PDs. The website now provides helpful resources including a timeline for PD/APDs outlining important dates, links to relevant sites, a list/link of the neonatal fellowship programs in the US, standard forms, and lists of fellow opportunities including neonatal divisions that are currently in the process of hiring faculty. Please email any suggestions for improvement or updated program information to Patrick Myers (pmyers@luriechildrens.org). ONTPD website: https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the- aap/Committees-Councils-Sections/Neonatal-Perinatal-M edicine/Neonatologist/Pages/ONTPD.aspx A survey was sent out to all PDs this summer addressing topics of interest including curriculum, call structure, clinical and research requirements, approach to procedure competency and more. If you have not completed this survey or need access, please contact Lindsay.Johnston@yale.com. We hope to share the results at the annual fall ONTPD meeting. Dates to Remember: All will take place in New Orleans in conjunction with the 2019 AAP NCE this fall. Agendas and meeting locations will be sent out soon. Annual Neonatal-Perinatal Fellowship PD/APD Bootcamp, October 24th, 3pm-6pm Annual ONTPD Reception, October 24th, 6pm-9pm (immediately following Bootcamp) Sponsored by Abbott Nutrition ONTPD Annual Meeting, October 25th, 9am- 4pm MidCaN Neonatologists (MidCaN) subgroup of SoNPM met in Scottsdale on the Friday morning of the Workshop on Neonatal Perinatal Pediatrics. This was a working meeting and our growth and development is right on track. Thanks to the SoNPM leadership for their continued support. The focus area for MidCaN in 2019-2020 will be leadership development . MidCaN will be hosting quarterly webinars starting August 13th with our inaugural webinar, \"Setting Career Goals and Defining Your Success\" presented by Steve Olsen and Mary Anne Jackson. Many mid-career neonatologists are feeling comfortable. Fellowship is over, the board exam has been passed, and the work schedule of a neonatologist has become routine. But looking toward the future, some may find themselves struggling with work-life balance, leading without any formal leadership skills or training, grappling to find purpose and meaning in the current healthcare environment, questioning how best to contribute to their current group practice, considering promotion but confused on how to get there, or deciding what legacy they want to leave when they retire. We hope that this webinar will help you do the following: Better define your career goals, know how to navigate barriers to success, recognize stressors/caring for self, and formulate a plan for negotiating a faculty position that makes you happy. Save the date August 13, 2pm (central time) and stay tuned for more information by email. Subsequent webinar topics include developing your leadership skills, creating an elevator speech, leading QI efforts, and fiscal planning for physicians. Make sure to share with your colleagues and institutions, as these webinars are not limited to MidCaN or even SoNPM members.

Book Review Essentials of Neonatal Ventilation Tonse N. K. Raju, MD, DCH, FAAP Those of us working every day in the NICU might not have perceived the magnitude of changes in the practice of neonatal ventilation over the past decade. The improvements have been continuous, cumulative, and insidious. Thus, an occasional \"moonlighter\" entering the NICU after a ten- year gap might feel like being in a scene from the science fiction thrillerBlack Panther . He would urgently need to learn acronyms: NCPAP, Bi-Phasic CPAP, NIPPV, NHFJV, HFNC, HFOV and handle, such as Diltiazem, Tadalafil, Dipyridamole, Bosentan, and Milrinone, and would need to re-learn the new uses for old remedies like caffeine, Tylenol, hydrocortisone, and Sildenafil. He would have to unlearn use of 100% oxygen for resuscitation and forget oropharyngeal suction at the perineum or intubation and suction of the airway to remove thick meconium. No routine surfactant followed by automatic ventilator use, and no chest percussion and vibration to remove secretions every 2 hours. How should one get a quick update on all these and more? Essentials of Neonatal Ventilation brilliantly fits the bill. Edited by the well-known and respected neonatologists, Drs. P.K. Rajiv, D. Vidyasagar, and S. Lakshminrusimha, this volume has contributions from 89 experts from 13 7countries including Australia, Canada, China, Egypt, Germany, India, Italy, Oman, Qatar, Spain, UAE, United Kingdom, and the United States. The book is presented in eight sections with 40 chapters. Most chapters are under 20 pages - laudable brevity. Starting with the history of the evolution of neonatal ventilation and ending with chapters on developmental follow-up, ethical issues, and reference values, the book chapters cover multiple aspects of ventilatory care. When appropriate, the chapters offer illustrative case studies with superb and plentiful x-ray images. Each chapter begins with a \"Chapter Contents Headline\" and a listing of \"Chapter Points\" followed by easily understandable and lucid text. Separate chapters deal with clinical management of specific pulmonary and cardiac disorders including shock. Two full sections with 31 chapters deal with ventilators and ventilatory care, describing types of conventional mechanical ventilators, high-frequency ventilation, NAVA, and non-invasive ventilatory techniques among others. Developmental and physiological underpinnings are provided along with practical step-by-step approaches for setting up mechanical ventilators, monitoring infants, weaning from ventilators, and handling unexpected deteriorations. In the \"Ancillary Services\" section, we read about the management of airways, tubes, catheters, suctioning and other very important nursing care issues. On the book's electronic pages, one has access to videos and lectures on sustained lung inflation, CPAP, SNIPPV, NAVA, ECHO, and pulmonary graphics. All in all, the book is a superbly comprehensive volume. There are eye-catching illustrations rendered by Dr. Lakshminrusimha, co-editor, and an accomplished professional artist and cartoonist in his own right. For Satyan, spending several months drawing more than 200 pictures must have been a labor of love. While a rare drawing may seem \"cartoonish\" (e.g., Fig 26.8, a baby with differential cyanosis), such occasional exuberance is pardonable, especially since we learn so much with the help of so many illustrations. Superb examples are: Fig. 7.1 (page 70) depicting the \"old\" and the \"new BPD\", Fig 9B.5 (page 118) on mucociliary clearance, Fig 14.5 (page 212) on barotrauma in infants with heterogeneous lung disease, and Fig. 25A.3 (page 419) about the cellular mechanisms in the pathology of meconium aspiration syndrome. These are proof that brilliant pictures in this volume are worth more than thousands of words! This is one of the best books on neonatal ventilation I have read. A copy of this should be in each NICU, securely chained to a table. It should be required reading for residents and neonatal fellows, respiratory therapists, the neonatal nursing staff, and yes, for the academic and practicing neonatologists to learn, teach, and manage infants requiring ventilatory care. If I had neonatology fellows, I would gift each of them with a copy of this book for Christmas or the New Year - alas, I have none. Rajiv PK, Vidyasagar D, and Lakshminrushimha S, Editors.

Section Sponsored Fellow Conferences Offer Education, Networking and Career Development Ann R Stark MD, FAAP The Section Education Committee continues to support highly successful national and regional conferences for fellows. All meetings include state-of-the-art talks by distinguished faculty and networking time with faculty and the other attendees. The national conferences held in Santa Fe, NM and Scottsdale, AZ are clinically oriented; at those in Snowmass, CO and Bonita Springs, FL, fellows present their research in either a 10-minute platform presentation or a poster. The four regional conferences also provide an opportunity for fellow attendees to give a platform presentation of their research. Faculty provides written anonymous feedback on oral research presentations that attendees appreciate. The conferences are organized by a three or four person planning group whose members typically plan two meetings during their term. In addition to senior and mid- career neonatologists, each national planning group includes a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, providing a perinatal perspective and also encouraging applications from MFM fellows. The universally glowing evaluations by attendees confirm that these conferences provide a wonderful learning and networking opportunity, a tribute to the efforts of the planning groups and the enthusiastic fellows who attend. Career development is an important focus of these conferences. An informal career advice session is a key component of the agenda. These are typically organized Save the Date! 44th Annual District VIII Conference June 4-7, 2020 Santa Fe, NM http://www.district8perinatal.org/www .aap.org/perinatal SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 8around fellows' questions and include topics such as when to begin the job application process, what to include in a cover letter, what to ask in an interview, and how to negotiate after a job offer. Fellows frequently ask about career trajectory and research funding, how to manage work and life issues, and bring up other concerns about how to move forward after fellowship. These discussions enable fellows to broaden their exposure by hearing about experiences of faculty outside their own program. In addition, networking with faculty and planning group members during coffee breaks, meals, and social activities has sometimes directly resulted in subsequent invitations to visit and offers of faculty positions. Invitations to participate/submit abstracts are generally sent to Program Directors and Division Chiefs 3-4 months prior to the meeting. National conferences are limited to one fellow applicant per program selected by their Program Director. The national Perinatal and Developmental Medicine Symposia require an abstract with the application and attendees are selected by the planning group based on abstract quality. For the regional conferences, application also requires an abstract submission and any number of fellows may apply from each fellowship program. These conferences are sponsored by unrestricted grants from Mead Johnson Nutrition (research conferences) and Abbott Nutrition (clinical conferences) to the AAP Section on Neonatal Perinatal Medicine. The programs are developed independently by the planning groups. The grants cover all related expenses for the fellows.

Women in Neonatology (WiN) Shazia Bhombal MD, FAAP for the WiN Steering Committee WiN had another successful two gatherings this past spring, with the second annual meeting following the Workshop on Neonatal-Perinatal Practice Strategies in Scottsdale, AZ as well as a gathering at the PAS conference in Baltimore. At the Scottsdale meeting, the Steering Committee, comprised of Marilyn Escobedo, Shazia well members to the Committee, Namrita Odackal, representing TECaN, and Lily Lou, opened the meeting with updates since the previous gathering at the NCE in the fall. Dr. Savich highlighted the disparities in salaries of women neonatologists from the 2019 publication by Horowitz, Feldman and Savich in the Journal of Perinatology . Dr. Dammann discussed the WiN resolution proposed at the AAP Annual Leadership Forum entitled, \"Promoting Women in Leadership in Pediatrics,\" and Dr. Lingappan outlined the abstract titled, \"Promoting Women in Leadership and Addressing Gender Disparities in Neonatology: Launch of Women in Neonatology,\" which was accepted at the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) 2019 Group on Faculty Affairs Professional Development Conference to be held in Chicago from July 11-13. The meeting also included a presentation by Dr. Dena Hubbard entitled, \"Put Your Oxygen Mask On First - Health and Wellness,\" which outlined the results of the wellness survey sent out to the SoNPM last fall and facilitated a discussion on addressing wellness and burnout. WiN Speed Dating was a popular event, providing an opportunity to meet colleagues one- on-one and discuss a variety of topics. Ten neonatology fellows were supported by the Section to attend the event and provided their valuable perspective and opinions to the meeting. Dr. Christina Mangurian, Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at UCSF School of Medicine and the UCSF Department of Psychiatry's Vice Chair for Diversity and Health Equity, was the keynote speaker. Dr. Mangurian has authored numerous publications on gender inequality, and is a founding member of Times Up Healthcare. Her presentation focused on her article in the Harvard Business Review, \"What is Holding Women in Medicine Back from Leadership,\" and was followed by a lively small group discussion, which generated needs and goals. These included achieving transparency at institutions www .aap.org/perinatal SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 9regarding topics including salary, recruitment, promotions, as well as leadership training, mentorship, networking, diversity, awareness and prevention of microaggressions, and creation of family-friendly policies. WiN held a gathering at the PAS meeting in Baltimore, with over 40 women in attendance. The meeting demonstrated the enthusiasm and excitement for WiN, and we look forward to further discussions and networking at upcoming meetings. Ourupcoming WiN meetings are at the NCE meeting in New Orleans, Oct 27, 1-4pm and in Scottsdale, March 29-30, following the SoNPM workshop. Topics to be addressed at future meetings include awareness and management of microaggressions, leadership, negotiation skills and financial health.

We also now have a web page that you can access at: https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the- aap/Committees-Councils-Sections/Neonatal-Perinatal-M edicine/Neonatologist/Pages/well-established-career- neonatologists.aspx. Suggestions for the webpage are welcome. At the business meeting, we also discussed future meetings including frequency and suggestions for content. At the current time, we are thinking of meeting twice a year, once at the NCE (in New Orleans this year) and at the Scottsdale Workshop. Please send your ideas for future topics to Stephen Pearlman (spearlman@christianacare.org) or Scott Duncan (scottd.duncan@louisville.edu). Scott Duncan, the Secretary-Treasurer of WECaN, gave an outstanding presentation about opting out of night call.Scott has done his due diligence and collected information from centers aside from his own through a survey tool. While several academic institutions allow a neonatologist to opt out of in-house night call, currently, there is no consensus as to how, or even if, one should be allowed to opt out of call at a certain age. As a corollary to this topic, we discussed assessment of competency. Although this subject was of great interest to the group, no conclusions were reached. As conveyed by people in the audience, there does seem to be some traction for assessing competency at some institutions. The group felt that self- awareness was a major ingredient and any assessment should be generalizable, focusing on professional practice evaluation. The keynote discussion for our meeting was a presentation on when adverse health events impact your ability to practice (hence the title of this article). Three brave souls, Brian Carter from Children's Mercy, Marilyn Escobedo from Oklahoma University and Joanna Beachy from Northwell Health System, shared their experiences with health challenges that had a significant impact on their clinical and personal lives. Their frank perspectives on their struggles captivated the audience who also shared some of their own experiences. WECaN is so thankful to them for being willing to discuss these very difficult issues with our group. We concluded the meeting with a mentoring session with members of TECaN (Trainees and Early Career Neonatologists) and MidCaN (Mid-Career Neonatologists). We broke into small groups at round tables, each with representation from each of the three groups. We did a mentoring exercise and robust discussions ensued. Those discussions continued at a social event that occurred following the meeting. This helped to build new friendships and esprit de corps amongst these groups who face different challenges at various stages of their careers. We hope that if you are reading this and are over 50, or 18 or more years out of fellowship, you will sign up for the listserv and join us for our next meeting! More details to follow. In the meanwhile, have a fun, safe and relaxing summer. 2019 Spring Workshop Summary Krithika Lingappan MD, FAAP The 2019 Workshop on Neonatal-Perinatal Practice Strategies was held again this year at the beautiful DoubleTree Paradise Valley Resort in Scottsdale, AZ on March 29-31, 2019. The Planning Committee put together an exciting collection of speakers, interactive breakout sessions, and thought-provoking talks and workshops. The Workshop this year had record attendance. The meeting provided the attendees with the opportunity forwww .aap.org/perinatal SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 10 closer interaction with AAP leaders and speakers in an ideal setting. The topics were carefully selected to cater to a wide range of neonatology providers and all stages of neonatologists from trainees and early career to more senior neonatologists. The meeting kicked off with the session on neonatal coding offered on Friday morning by Dr. Edward Liechty and group with a case-based discussion of various clinical scenarios as they relate to coding to billing. The session was interactive and well received by the audience. Apgar Awardee Dr. Saroj Saigal presented the L. Joseph Butterfield Lecture on Friday afternoon titled, \"Prematurity for Life.\" Dr.Saigal is a world-renowned expert on neonatal follow-up, especially as it pertains to health-related quality of life of premature neonates. Dr. Jochen Profit delivered an enlightening talk on \"Addressing Disparities in NICU Care.\" The attendees were able to decipher how neonatology care providers can participate in finding and promoting solutions to disparities in care delivery. Drs. Haresh Kirpalani and Barbara Schmidt presented a joint talk on \"Evidence-Based Neonatology: Trade-Offs between Benefits and Risks of Common Therapies.\" Then, Mark Del Monte JD, CEO/Executive Vice-President of AAP, provided an engaging update of national health care policies as they pertain to neonatologists. Dr. Mark Hudak, SoNPM Chair, delivered the Section update followed by the presentation of the 2018 AAP Landmark Award to Drs. Carol Baker and Ann Schuchat for their work on GBS prophylaxis. Breakout sessions with early career, management or clinical focus in small groups were the focus on Saturday. Topics included: Combating health care provider burn-out in the NICU; benefits of delayed cord clamping; transfusion thresholds for premature neonates; implementing systems of care for NAS; developing a comprehensive, practical, and fiscally sound strategic plan for your NICU; oxygen saturation target ranges and alarm settings after the NEOPROM Trials; and a medical improv session for antenatal counseling. The Saturday afternoon workshop entitled, \"Beyond Extreme Prematurity: Management of the 22 to 23 Week Gestation Premature Infant\" was led by Dr. Jonathan Klein (University of Iowa). The workshop reviewed their single center survival of premature neonates at 22-23 weeks gestation and examined the differences in culture and philosophy when caring for 22-23 week GA neonates. The workshop was one of the best attended in the history of the meeting and was very interactive. The session from the Committee on Fetus and Newborn presented highlights on neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and perinatal GBS prevention. Dr. Stephen Patrick talked on NAS and provided an update on the recent state and federal policy changes that may affect pregnant women with opioid use disorder and infants with NAS, and provided know-how for applying a model of care for NAS.Dr. Stephanie Kukora presented a session on communication and shared decision-making challenges in antenatal consultation. A unique session on Sunday was presented by Mr. Rick Guidotti, the founder and director of Positive Exposure, an innovative art, education and advocacy organization working with individuals living with genetic differences. His talk was titled, \"Positive Exposure: Seeing Beyond the Diagnosis.\" He described the social and psychological experiences of people of all ages and ethnic-cultural heritages living with genetic, physical, behavioral, and cognitive conditions. His talk was very moving and changed the perspective with which patients with genetic diagnoses are viewed. Dr. DeWayne Pursley summed up the key take-home points from the Workshop while eliciting responses and opinions from the meeting registrants about the topics that were presented through the interactive use of the Audience Response System. Attendees were able to obtain valuable MOC Part II credit through the completion of pre- and post-meeting questions. Also, many focused career groups: Trainee and early career (TECaN), mid-career (MidCaN), senior (WECaN) had networking opportunities during the meeting. I want to thank all the planning committee members and the AAP staff who worked hard to organize the meeting and deserve accolades for the success of the 2019 meeting. The Committee is hard at work putting together an excellent meeting for 2020. Please mark your calendars for March 27-29, 2020. We hope to see many of you at Scottsdale! SoNPM Program at the 2019 NCE in New Orleans Angel Rios MD, FAAP Please plan to attend the Section on Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine Program at the 2019 AAP National Conference Exhibition Meeting in New Orleans, October 25-29, 2019. The Program will begin with the Friday evening Gerald Merenstein Lecture given by Seetha Shankaran, followed by the opening reception and poster session. Then, on Saturday morning session we will begin with scientific oral platform presentations. Saturday afternoon will be dedicated to the microbiome. The Human Microbiome Project has revealed that there are far more bacterial cells residing in the human intestine than host cells. It has been stated that a human body contains ten times more bacterial cells than human cells. This session will focus on the following areas: Review present- day culture-independent techniques utilized to analyze the DNA extracted directly from a sample for bacterial analysis; discuss colonization resistance which is the www .aap.org/perinatal SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 11 mechanism to protect against incursion of spacing and /or overgrowth of pathogens; the role of the intrauterine microbiome and its effect the mother/fetal dyad; examine the effects of antibiotics on the intestinal microbiome, metabolome and inflammatory mediators; and discuss the role of prebiotics and probiotics in the dysbiotic preterm gut microbiome. Guest speakers will include Josef Neu, Jae Kim, Kjersti Aagaard, Rodney Dietert and Joseph Petrosino. On Sunday morning, a joint session with the Section on Breastfeeding will focus on controversial topics and emerging data related to provision of human milk and breastfeeding for preterm infants. This session will focus on hospital-based practices to support families in providing breast milk for their infants, racial/ethnic disparities in breastfeeding, mechanisms by which human milk oligosaccharides are involved in immune development and health outcomes of mothers and infants, recent evidence regarding donor milk and differences in benefits compared to mother's own milk, and emerging sources of donor milk, including informal milk sharing. The session will also include a focused discussion on challenges with on-going need for fortification, feeding discoordination, and transitioning to direct breastfeeding. The expert panel will include Lars Bode, Aloka Patel, Tarah Colaizy and Sarah Taylor. Sunday afternoon will be an interactive joint session with the Section on Simulation and Innovative Learning Methods with the expert panel of Taylor Sawyer and Lou Halamek. Post-event debriefings in healthcare are facilitated discussions of a clinical event, focused on learning and performance improvement. Post-event debriefing is a foundational behavior of high-performance teams. The goal of the session is to educate neonatal healthcare providers on effective ways to conduct post- event debriefings in neonatal care utilizing video scenarios and group discussion on debriefing in the clinical setting. We are looking forward to an exciting and interactive meeting with excellent faculty. Hope to see you there! For more information and registration, see https://aapexperience.org/registration/ View from the Chair Mark Hudak MD, FAAP I write this in June trying to anticipate what might still be relevant by late summer-early fall when this Newsletter is published. So much of what we read today focuses on immediate events and naturally fades into a less pressing past. The challenge for today is to communicate in a way that may have some enduring meaning! This month, it was my privilege as Chair of the Section to attend and contribute in a small way to two neonatology fellows' conferences. Not only was I able to catch up with some colleagues, but I met for the first time other iconic neonatologists and maternal-fetal medicine physicians. These were two very different venues for the fellows who attended. At the 43rd Fellows Seminar on Perinatal Pediatrics, our trainees mostly enjoyed soaking up state- of-the-art subject talks and sage career advice presentations. At the 84th Perinatal and Developmental Medicine Symposium in Snowmass, they both learned from the faculty and had a chance to present their own research and ask their peers questions in a supportive environment. In both settings, the fellows had many opportunities to talk with the faculty informally and learn that even iconic faculty are, well, no more than just regular people! How many of us attended one of these conferences during our training and made a contact that had a lasting impact on our career? I remember having an existential conversation with Dr. Philip Sunshine during a volleyball game (of all things) and finding affirmation that a long-term career as a clinician-scientist could provide lifelong inspiration. Others of you first met and later married someone from one of these conferences (there are records)! And, it was heartening to validate that the next generation of neonatologists are more accomplished, more articulate, more well-rounded, and as passionate as I Coding Question Edward Liechty MD, FAAP You have previously met and counseled an expectant couple whose fetus has been diagnosed with Potter's sequence. The family and their obstetrician has decided they want neonatology at the delivery, and if the infant has obvious severe respiratory insufficiency incompatible with survival then they want comfort measures only. You attend the delivery and after examination of the infant it is clear the prenatal diagnosis is correct. You admit the infant to a private NICU room and order comfort care only. The infant survives 2 hours and during this time you spend a total of 40 minutes of bereavement counseling with the family. In addition, you document 40 minutes spent on preparing the admission note and orders. After the child dies, you document an additional 25 minutes preparing the death summary and death certificate. Correct CPT codes for SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 12 remember we were in those years. We WECaN will wind down our careers knowing that our beloved specialty will be in excellent hands. Another privilege afforded to the Chair of the Section is to introduce the speakers at the Silverman and Butterfield lectureships and present the Apgar, Fanaroff, Landmark, and Pioneer Awards. I was very pleased to introduce Dr. Saroj Saigal, the 2018 Apgar Award winner, at the Joseph Butterfield annual lecture in Scottsdale in March. We name these lectures in honor of past luminaries, but with the express intent to have an opportunity every year to enthrall and inspire the present generation with accomplishments from long ago. There is a thrill each year in crafting and telling a story that will remind many members of the audience and will educate some for the first time about the contributions of Virginia Apgar, Joe, and Saroj and the common threads that will forever bind them. Similarly, it was humbling at the AAP Presidential Plenary Session at PAS to have the honor to talk at some length about the formative experiences that shaped William Silverman to become the first true therapeutic skeptic in our field. It was great to recognize some of the people that Bill influenced directly or indirectly - all, like Bill, past Apgar Awardees - Jack Sinclair; and Jon Tyson, Saroj Saigal and Barbara Schmidt in the audience - and then to introduce Norman Fost as the 2019 Silverman lecturer. Bill launched the field of evidence-based medicine through a carefully structured series of rigorous clinical trials. He was amazingly economical in his scientific approach. Reading his papers in order, he never lost a day and appeared never to lose a patient to an important investigation. He perfected the methodology of sequential analysis that allowed him to stop a trial when it reached statistical significance. He challenged everything, and thank goodness that he did, or the Blackfan hypothesis that had prevailed for 25 years which characterized preterm infants as physiologic poikilotherms might have gone uncorrected for another quarter century. Bill's motto was \"semper plangere\" - \"always complain\" in Latin. He was faithful to his motto and the bane to his temporal equivalent of the NIH study section. He also was vociferously opposed to the creation of the new specialty of neonatology, anticipating quite presciently that this would end the physician-family relationship in most cases after a successful home discharge. For Bill had a conscience about the lifelong effects of neonatal therapeutics, and cared deeply about his patients as they developed throughout childhood. Later in his life, he wrote a series of anonymous essays under the nom de plume \"Malcontent\" in a regular column called \"Fumes from the Spleen.\" He published many of these in a 1998 book entitled Where's the Evidence - a must-read for every neonatologist. At this time, you can find this for purchase on Amazon or eBay. For those of you who like vocabulary quizzes, try out the site freerice.com (which may have migrated by the fall to beta.freerice.com). There are 60 levels. If anyone reaches level 50 (no cheating!) let me know and I will publish your name here! I never realized there were so many 4 and 5 letter words I have never encountered! As you progress through the words, you secure more and more donations of rice to feed the hungry. Finally for fall reading, I recommend the book The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History by Elizabeth Kolbert. Published in 2014, this non-fiction work won the Pulitzer Prize in 2015 for its exquisite explanations of complicated scientific topics in language understandable to the non- scientist. It is not a feel-good read and paints a very scary picture of what can possibly happen to the natural order by 2100. In this moment of \"it's all about me,\" I have to feel optimistic about the energy of our youth and the alternatives that we have. This will really be our life's and our generation's challenge. It is all about the future of our world and of our very next generations, and it begins with us. Trainees and Early Career Neonatologists (TECaN) Update Ashley Lucke MD TECaN continues to be an enthusiastic group with a robust plan for the coming year! As the newly-elected TECaN Chair, I'm excited to share a snapshot of the work we are doing and invite you to email us at tecan@aap.org with questions or requests to get involved. While we have active TECaN committees devoted to Advocacy, Research/Quality Improvement, Global Health, Ethics and Membership, we will be placing special focus on our Career Development and Education Committees this year. The TECaN Career Development Committee will be providing information on the job search process and resources to help fellows in that stage of their career. Specific effort will be made to incorporate private practice information. For early career members, there will be content on transitioning into practice, coding and billing, balancing family and parenting while trying to build your promotion portfolio, etc. Through the combination of podcasts, blogs, written resources and website content, the Committee hopes to become a prime resource for TECaN members seeking career guidance and information. The TECaN Fellowship Committee continues to work with the Organization of Neonatal Training Program Directors (ONTPD) to develop flipped classroom modules for the national fellowship curriculum. Expanding upon this, TECaN is thrilled to announce the creation of a board study group. More details of the structure for this group will come in the next 2-3 months, look out for more information in the monthly TECaN newsflashes. TECaN is also launching a podcast series aimed at discussing the common issues of neonatal fellows and www .aap.org/perinatal SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 13 early career physicians that aren't covered in our formal education. We hope to release new podcasts every 2-3 weeks and are open to suggestions for content. We welcome ideas and requests at our general TECaN council email, tecan@aap.org. Finally, as many of you know TECaN's first national advocacy campaign, #NavigatingNAS, is wrapping up this fall with the start of quarter four on August 1st. Quarter four focuses on NAS beyond discharge with resources for discharge home, neurodevelopmental outcomes and the multidisciplinary medical home. This campaign has been a tremendous success with hundreds of webinar participants, thousands of website visits and a planning committee from over 40 institutions working together to improve the care for these families. It's never too late to join in the work and we encourage you to check out the campaign website at https://aap.org/navigatingnas! If you have great ideas, are motivated to turn them into reality, and desire leadership opportunities, I encourage you to apply for one of our TECaN Executive Council positions. We will be accepting applications in July 2019 for Chair of Career Development/Leadership, Chair of Research/Quality Improvement, and Regional Fellow Representative positions. For more information on how to apply, email tecan@aap.org or visit our website https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/Committees- Councils-Sections/Neonatal-Perinatal-Medicine/TECAN/Pa ges/tecan.aspx. Please feel free to contact me with any ideas, questions, or to obtain information on how to get more involved (ashleyluckemd@gmail.com). We look forward to hearing from you! 2018 Landmark Awardees Anne Schuchat and Carol Baker The Executive Committee of the Section on Neonatal- Perinatal Medicine has awarded the 2018 Landmark Award to Drs. Anne Schuchat and Carol Baker for their seminal work in defining the burden of illness of neonatal Group B streptococcal disease, and in implementing a national public health initiative to reduce its incidence through screening and prophylaxis. Prior to the current era of neonatal intensive care, group B streptococcus (GBS) had emerged as a leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity in North America, with an estimated 7,500 infants affected annually in the US, and a case fatality rate as high as 50%. Beginning in the 1970s, Dr. Baker performed pioneering translational work in identifying the role of GBS in meningitis, the incidence of colonization, mechanisms of immunity, and antibiotic susceptibilities. Dr. Schuchat and colleagues built upon Dr. Baker's foundational work in reporting a series of studies that defined population-based risk factors as well as the accuracy of screening cultures in predicting neonatal group B streptococcal disease. Her observation that hospitals with screening programs had fewer newborns with early-onset GBS led her to facilitate and advocate for the issuance by CDC of consensus guidelines for screening- or risk-based GBS prevention, which were subsequently endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. These practices were universally adopted, and led directly to a profound decrease in the incidence of early-onset GBS disease that persists to the present day. For their combined efforts in developing the basic and translational science, their championing the application of the tools of public health surveillance and intervention, and for the resulting impact on generations of babies and their families, Drs. Schuchat and Baker are highly deserving of www .aap.org/perinatal SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 TECaN Executive Council at Scottsdale Workshop Hudak and Baker 14 the Section on Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine Landmark Award. The 2018 Landmark Award was presented to Carol Baker by Section Chair, Mark Hudak, at the Workshop on Neonatal Perinatal Practice Strategies in Scottsdale, AZ on March 30, 2019. Today's NeoPREP Lily Lou MD, FAAP and Kelly Wade MD, FAAP Since 1992, the NeoPREP course, has been a premier study resource offered by the Section on Neonatal Perinatal Medicine to provide comprehensive review and help prepare for the Board Exam. Some of us remember bringing our sharpened No. 2 pencils to the testing venue, stoking our brains with caffeine, and devoting the better part of a day to earning our credentials to practice neonatology. The ritual was repeated every seven years, then every ten, with MOC parts 2 and 4 filling out the agenda. The pencils eventually evolved to a computer screen with a finite scratch pad, and now the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) is poised to even more fundamentally change how neonatologists are assessed to assure that we are up to date in our fund of knowledge. Given our fast-paced lifestyles, there is less time to devote to comprehensive review and more need for interactive learning. The MOCA-Peds pilot is winding up and the ABP is ready to transition the specialty certification process from a big periodic test to a continuum of assessment questions. Just like the MOCA-Peds structure, MOCA-Neo will provide four quarterly sets of 20 questions at a time, throughout the year, repeated each year for four years. Once a question is opened, it must be answered within five minutes so there is a short time allowed to access your references. The cycle restarts every five years. At this point, there will still be an option to take a computer exam every five years. The ongoing MOCA-style format is a much more \"authentic\" strategy to assess practical knowledge, but how will that change the way we prepare? The NeoPREP course has always attracted three categories of attendees: (1) fellows and first time certifiers, (2) MOC re-certifiers, and (3) those seeking a comprehensive review of our field. The NeoPREP's diverse array of learners and outstanding faculty provides a invigorating environment to meet each learners' goals, from passing the boards to stimulating debate on difficult management scenarios, in parallel breakouts where learners can choose between \"core knowledge\" and \"beyond the boards\" sessions. The NeoPREP Planning Committee uses input from past attendees and TECaN and leverages many AAP SoNPM resources to enhance the curriculum. Despite changes in MOC recertification,mid-career neonatologists continue to remark on the benefits of dedicated time for comprehensive review and interaction with faculty. The NeoPREP course continues to evolve to provide learners with what they want in a comprehensive course. The primary mission remains - to provide immersive, memorable comprehensive review in a protected setting with leaders in the field. The 2020 NeoPREP course will be shortened to five days, accommodating the busy lifestyles and financial constraints of learners. The 2020 course will continue to provide breakout sessions for core board review and clinical management, 40 MOC points, and pre/post test assessments. Given the shorter time frame, the course will highlight the most high-yield topics identified by learners and additionally provide supplemental materials such as audience response questions, electronic flash cards, and a forum for reflection on self-study strategies. Advanced, interactive technology will be used throughout the conference to keep learners engaged. All in all, the NeoPREP course should be a great bargain, with more varied learning tools and a chance to interact with experts in our field in a stimulating setting. We aim to keep pace with the evolving testing format and meet the needs of all learners with these changes. The next course will be February 7-11, 2020 at the Renaissance Hotel in Long Beach, CA.

From www.dignitymemorial.com A Coalition to Eliminate Preventable Deaths from Unplanned Extubations Joaquim M B Pinheiro MD, MPH, FAAP The AAP is participating in a growing coalition of 18 multispecialty healthcare and patient safety organizations aimed at preventing deaths associated with unplanned extubations (UE). The recently-formed collaboration, named Coalition for Unplanned Extubation Awareness and Prevention is led by the Society for Airway Management (SAM). It aims to eliminate deaths and reduce the frequency, sequelae and costs associated with UE. As noted in a SAM press release, \"Researchers estimate that up to 33,000 adult deaths per year in US hospitals can be attributed to unplanned extubation.\" Other statistics cited by SAM include 120,000 annual incidents of UE in adult ICUs, resulting in over 34,000 additional ventilator-associated pneumonias and a doubling of the length of ICU stays; overall, UEs increase unnecessary healthcare costs by $5 billion annually. The SAM summary reports that \"the incidence of unplanned extubation in adult ICUs ranges from 0.5% to 35.8% and 1.0% to 80.8% in neonatal ICUs.\" Published studies consistently show a higher risk of UE in children (particularly neonates) compared with adults, but the estimates of the health and economic sequelae of UE in pediatric populations are inadequate to date. Uniquely in neonates, UE events may also increase the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage. The very small allowances of neonatal tracheas for endotracheal tube movement before extubation occurs, along with reluctance to use sustained sedation due to adverse effects, contribute to the high risk of UE in newborns. Additionally, early detection of UE events is difficult since intubated newborns commonly exhibit a baseline cardiorespiratory lability with desaturations and bradycardia, and there is limited utility of technologies to continuously track airway function, such as end-tidal CO2 monitoring. Preliminary analysis of over 200 UE events in a quality improvement (QI) project suggests that UEs in preterm neonates most often involve internal dislodgement of the endotracheal tube which prompts active tube removal by clinicians (J. Pinheiro, unpublished observations) - a type of UE that is notconsistently counted under various operational definitions. Unsurprisingly, the distinct mechanisms of UE in neonates will likely require different approaches to detecting these events and mitigating their consequences than those used in adult patients. A more pervasive problem contributing to undercounting of UEs is the lack of a core data set for UE events in electronic medical records, which impedes routine tracking of event rates by quality management systems. Thus, a major focus of the Coalition is to encourage hospitals to implement a core data set, which will allow them to assess their own UE rates. The Patient Safety Movement Foundation has developed Actionable Patient Safety Solutions (APSS), containing best practices to facilitate hospitals' QI efforts toward building processes that will allow them to identify and track UEs, institute new preventive interventions and accomplish the goal of zero preventable deaths. These are available for download at https://patientsafetymovement.org/actionable- solutions/challenge-solutions/airway-safety/unplanned-ext ubation/. The current APSS on General Airway Safety and Unplanned Extubations focus on adult patients, so that the processes to prevent, detect, mitigate and count UEs are not immediately applicable to children, particularly neonates. Clinicians representing the AAP (Joaquim Pinheiro), the Children's Hospitals' Solutions for Patient Safety Network (Anne Lyren, Larry Roy) and the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia are collaborating on APSS that aim to minimize the rates and impact of UEs in children and neonates. These will be available for implementation not only in children's hospitals but also in other hospitals serving pediatric populations. In the press release, SAM President Lauren Berkow said that the Society \"...is leading the effort of this multi- specialty working group to make the treatment of critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients safer. The first step is to increase awareness of the problem and its impact.\" Notably, the Coalition includes a partnership with the Do It for Drew Foundation, an organization that was founded in memory of Drew Hughes, a teenager who died following an UE event. Arthur Kanowitz, Co-Chair of the SAM Special Projects II Committee, added, \"Unplanned extubation is common and costly, yet the gravity of this problem is uncommonly recognized...If your incidence rate of preventable deaths is not zero, then you should implement a QI program to get you to zero.\" www .aap.org/perinatal SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 16 Calendar of Meetings Perinatal Workshop Scottsdale, AZ March 27-29, 2020 District VI Conference Chicago, IL September 6-7, 2019 VON Annual Quality Congress Chicago, IL October 3-7, 2019 AAP National Conference & Exhibition SoNPM Program New Orleans, LA October 25-29, 2019 Hot Topics Washington, DC December 8-12, 2019 33rd Annual Gravens Conference on the Physical & Development Environment of the High Risk Infant Clearwater Beach, FL March 6-9, 2020 Rapid Whole Genome Testing: Precision Medicine for Neonatology Andrea Scheurer MD, FAAP and Caleb Bupp MD Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine (RCIGM) is setting records for time to diagnosis for genetic disease in critically ill neonates. The genomics team at RCIGM in San Diego, CA performs rapid whole genome sequencing (rWGS) in collaboration with a growing list of children's hospitals across the nation. DeVos Children's Hospital in Grand Rapids has a research affiliation with RCIGM and Bronson Children's Hospital in Kalamazoo has Bronson Foundation financial support for test access. Care teams from both hospitals are already seeing the benefits of access to this test. Diagnostic utility for WGS in critically ill neonates with unclear etiology of illness and/or suspected genetic disease is 40-50%. Preliminary results return 3-7 days after sample arrival at RCIGM. Sample requirements are 0.5 ml of blood from the infant and 0.5 ml of blood from each parent if possible. Cost of testing is high and is not covered by insurance. The team at RCIGM is addressing this challenge with the launch of Project Baby Bear in 2018. Project Baby Bear is a $2 million Medi-Cal pilot program investigating the impact of rWGS on medical management, neonatal outcomes, and medical costs. This is the first time WGS has ever been covered by a public health program.www .aap.org/perinatal SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 Project Baby Bear sequenced its first patient in fall 2018 and since then, growing numbers of infants have received genetic diagnoses. This test is changing management, improving outcomes, and easing acceptance of comfort care when appropriate. In addition, a recent publication by Farnaes, Lauge,et al.in NPJ Genomic Medicine reviews how rWGS both reduces risk of morbidity and is associated with cost savings between $800,000-2 million per patient. It will not be long before insurance companies will see that cost savings accompany improved outcomes from earlier and accurate diagnosis. Learn more about Project Baby Bear and RCIGM at www.RadyGenomics.org. Neonatologists need to become better informed about the clinical application of genomic medicine and rWGS. Education about rWGS is key to increasing interest and expanding access to this test for critically ill neonates. Recognizing this, The Vermont Oxford Network has recently partnered with RCIGM to form the Vermont Oxford Rady Children's Genomic Network. This is a learning network that seeks to improve the quality of newborn care by increasing knowledge and competency in genomic medicine for NICU teams.

Simulating Success, a project designed to improve teamwork and communication during neonatal resuscitations through on-site, simulation-based training has now engaged with the 4th and final cohort. Grow, Babies, Grow! (GBG) is CPQCC's 6th multi-site QI collaborative. The focus is improving VLBW growth and nutrition with the goal of reducing the proportion of infants with growth failure at discharge. Twenty-two CPQCC sites are participating in GBG. They are more than halfway through the active phase of the project. Interaction between sites continues between learning sessions #2 and #3 with monthly webcasts during which their teams report on their successes and challenges and are able to learn from the experiences of their peers. As a new addition to this collaborative, we have provided the opportunity for individual site QI consultations with members of the expert panel. CPQCC's PQIP has been hard at work over the last several months, with several subcommittees actively engaged in developing new features designed to strengthen QI support to member hospitals and broaden our reach with our QI activities. PQIP's Data Interface and Opportunities Committee (DIOC) has been updating CPQCC's report offerings to serve a more extensive range of member hospitals better and allow for more targeted quality improvement. DIOC will pilot the new reports with a small group of hospitals before rolling them out to everyone. More information on new reports will be shared once available. The QI Infrastructure Committee is developing a new model of QI support for hospitals that have not previously participated in CPQCC's traditional QI collaboratives. The new model will be less intensive than the collaborative model, but will still include access QI and content experts who will guide hospitals to improve outcomes in the chosen topic area. This new model is specifically designed to help smaller NICUs and those that have not previously participated in a CPQCC QI project to achieve their QI goals. As with the new reports, the model will be pilot tested with a small number of hospitals before it is formally launched to the rest of the membership. In partnership with the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative and Health Management Associates, CPQCC will engage in an effort to improve care for mothers and newborns affected by opioid use. The project team has gathered a multidisciplinary taskforce to work on this issue and will be rolling out a toolkit and implementation plan over this coming year. The taskforce is grateful to other state collaboratives and experts that have been helping us in this effort based on their experiences and prior work. In addition to this project, we will also be conducting a voluntary data collection effort for member NICUs interested in collecting data on maternal drug exposure and NAS. We are grateful for the group working on this initiative and in particular, the Co-Chairs Robert Castro, Lisa Chyi , and Angela Huang .

Since no resuscitation was performed, 99465 may not be reported. Neither an intensive care (99477) nor critical care (99468) admission code is justified, despite the critical nature of the child's condition, as no critical or intensive services are provided (comfort care only). 99463 is same admission and discharge of a normal newborn on the same day. This code would not be appropriate as the infant is not a normal newborn. Furthermore, discharge codes (99463, 99238, and 99239) apply only to infants discharged to home, and should not be used on the day of death. In this case the most appropriate admission code is 99233, a high complexity hospital admission. This code has a typical time of 90 minutes. You have documented in your note a total time of 105 minutes of floor/unit time devoted solely to this patient, and are therefore justified to report prolonged service (99356, prolonged service, 1st hour) in addition to 99233. Documentation should include a note that greater than 50% of time was spent counseling. Note that prolonged service codes may not be added to any global codes (99460-63, 99468-72). ICD-10 Codes for this infant would include: Z38.0 liveborn infant, born in hospital Q60.6 Potter's syndrome P28.5 Respiratory failure of newborn Z51.5 Encounter for palliative care Z66 Do not resuscitate The SoNPM Coding Education Committee assists the Section in assuring that CPT and ICD codes relevant to neonatology are up to date, appropriately valued, and that member compliance with coding rules is excellent. We advise members with ideas for new codes and assist in code development where appropriate. In addition, a major focus of the committee is to provide education on the current available codes and the guidelines for their use. Members are available for email and telephone consultations for specific coding-related questions. In addition, committee members are available on request for educational talks and workshops for State and District AAP meetings.

These trials have changed the perceptions of the neonatal community about trial quality and evidence-based patient management. The trials are remarkable for their virtually complete capture of patients for primary outcomes that include two-year follow-up. TIPP trial is one of the first in neonatology with a neurodevelopmental outcome rather than short-term outcomes. The CAP trial has received well- deserved attention and praise since the first results were published 13 years ago. In 2008, the CAP trial was selected for the Inaugural Trial of the Year Award by the Society of Clinical Trials and Project Impact. As a result of this work, Dr. Schmidt has been invited to speak about neonatal caffeine therapy in 25 countries around the world. Dr. Schmidt and her colleagues were the first to examine the prognostic effect of combinations of three neonatal morbidities (severe ROP, BPD, brain injury) on long-term outcomes. Using data from both the TIPP and CAP trials, they found that these morbidities contributed similarly and independently of each other to the prediction of the infant's status at 18 months. This allowed them to develop a simple predictive model based solely on the number of morbidities that are present at or soon after a post- menstrual age of 36 weeks. The morbidity count prediction model can be used to counsel parents and to identify infants at the highest risk of childhood disability. This is an example of how Barbara has worked with her collaborators to mine trial data to make important clinical observations. Dr. Schmidt has also been the center PI for University of Pennsylvania and CHOP in the NICHD Neonatal Research Network and has served as center PI and the PI for the Data Center for the NHLBI-funded Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Project (PROP) to evaluate lung outcomes in very preterm infants at seven academic centers. Her leadership to keep PROP focused and productive was essential. She also effectively used this project to develop junior neonatal colleagues at CHOP to great advantage. Barbara Schmidt has been a research mentor and thesis supervisor for neonatal fellows and MSc students in clinical epidemiology for the past 25 years. She has also built a sizable team of local colleagues and junior investigators at CHOP who are enthusiastic about their participation in clinical research. Over the course of her career, she has been the clinical research mentor and supervisor for more than a dozen neonatology fellows and young faculty. Most of her trainees are academic neonatologists. Barbara Schmidt has been a consummate clinical scientist, epidemiologist, and mentor whose contributions to the advancement of knowledge in the care of premature neonates are enormous. She is the thought-leader for clinical trials in neonatology. Her work has advanced the field of neonatology and has led to an improved evidence base in neonatology internationally. Dr. Schmidt will be presented with the 2019 Virginia Apgar Award at the Section on Neonatal Perinatal Medicine Program at the AAP NCE on Saturday, October 26, 2019 in New Orleans, LA. Alan Jobe 2019 Avroy Fanaroff Education Awardee: Ned Lawson MD The Avroy Fanaroff Education Award is bestowed upon an individual in recognition of outstanding contributions to the dissemination of knowledge in Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine for health care students, professionals, or the lay public. Ned Lawson has been selected as the 2019 Avroy Fanaroff Education Award recipient. Dr. Lawson's impact as a clinician, academician, leader, and importantly, his tenure as Editor-in-Chief of the Section's Journal of Perinatology make him an ideal candidate for this Award. Dr. Lawson completed his undergraduate work at Harvard College and received his MD at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago. He completed his pediatrics residency at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Boston where he also completed his neonatology training. Ned then returned to his roots with a position in the Neonatology Division at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, rising through the ranks from Assistant Professor to become Professor of Pediatrics in 1987. In 1999, Ned moved north to Baltimore, to become Professor in Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University and then the Josephine S. Sutland Professor of Newborn Medicine, as well as Chief of Neonatology and Vice Chair for Children's Center Operations, positions he held until his retirement in 2015. He is now Professor Emeritus in Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins. Ned has a robust record of academic achievement, citing more than 70 peer-reviewed publications with a focus on developmental respiratory control. His experimental work was well-supported by NIH. He has directly mentored eight fellows in his lab, all of whom have successful careers. He is a member of numerous professional societies including the Perinatal Research Society, Society for Pediatric Research, and American Pediatric Society. Importantly, while at University of North Carolina, Ned interacted with Dr. Joseph Garfunkel, then Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Pediatrics,who appointed Ned as Neonatal Section Editor of that journal, a position he held for ten years. As one of three Associate Editors, he gained enormous practical experience. In 2001, after the AAP and Section acquired the Journal of Perinatology,and long- Continued from Page 16 43 www .aap.org/perinatal SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 standing Editor-in-Chief Gil Martin was eager to find a replacement, the Section launched a search for his successor. During the application and interview process, Ned \"wowed\" the Search Committee with his experience and understanding of the editorial and publication process and his vision for the Journal. We were thrilled that he accepted the position, which he held from January 2001 to December 2018. Under Ned's leadership, the success of the Journalhas been quite remarkable. In 2001, the Journal of Perinatology received fewer than 250 manuscripts and published 122 articles in eight issues, of which 37% were original research. In 2018, the Journal received 859 manuscripts and published 264 articles in 12 issues, of which 74% were original research. During this period, the impact factor increased substantially and total citations tripled. The educational importance of the role of editor in a medical subspecialty journal is extremely important and perhaps under-recognized. The results of new studies might be presented at a conference to, at most, 300 attendees. In contrast, the large majority of our community of 3,800 neonatologists reads those studies in one of four or five journals. They rely on the few individuals at the helm of those publications both to vet the articles through sound peer review as well as to identify themes and opportunities for research, dissemination, and improvement. In creating a strong and dedicated journal for neonatologists, Ned's leadership has helped to set the agenda for neonatology for almost two decades. In addition, Ned has generously shared his experience with many trainees and young faculty members seeking to publish their academic work. To this end, he has given numerous lectures and led many workshops at national and international meetings on planning, writing, and publishing, as well as discussions of ethical considerations. The prestigious Avroy Fanaroff Education Award recognizes Ned Lawson's outstanding contributions to education in our field through his stewardship of the Section's Journal of Perinatology for almost two decades and his investment in the education of his trainees and colleagues. Dr. Lawson will be presented with the 2019 Avroy Fanaroff Education Award at the Section on Neonatal Perinatal Medicine Program at the AAP NCE on Saturday, October 26, 2019 in New Orleans, LA. Ann Stark, MD 2019 Landmark Awardee: Ronald Clyman MD The Landmark Award has been given annually since 2001 in recognition of a distinct, seminal contribution in a specific area of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine. The 2019 Landmark Award recipient is Ronald Clyman, neonatologist, lab-based scientist, and clinical researcher, who is internationally recognized for his expertise on persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus (PDA). Dr. Clyman's unique and innovative contributions to our understanding of the PDA and its implications for pulmonary vascular biology and cardiovascular physiology during fetal transition to newborn life have defined the cutting edge of ductus research for more than 40 years. These sustained efforts and the frequency with which his publications are cited in our literature and international journals are a testament to the global impact of his research. It is remarkable for a single investigator to achieve such predominance over a research field in neonatology. Among his nearly 240 publications, Dr. Clyman has published over 150 papers and textbook chapters focused on one subject - the ductus arteriosus. This includes more than 110 original science contributions and 22 books and chapters. Invitations to write over 20 reviews and commentaries also provide evidence of his expertise on ductus function and management of PDA. Among investigators who study PDA and cardiopulmonary status in the newborn, he is regarded as the single most important author of original scientific advances on ductus biology and regulation. Dr. Clyman is overwhelmingly the most recognized leader in his field. The importance of prostaglandins in ductus regulation was first noted in the mid-1970s. As Dr. Clyman finished his fellowship training in 1977, he was already at the forefront of basic discoveries regarding PGE signaling pathways and would go on to determine the contributions of oxygen, nitric oxide, gestational maturity, and intracellular calcium sensing in PGE-mediated control of the fetal and postnatal ductus. These early accomplishments brought attention to his role as an opinion leader while he was still a junior faculty member. During this time, he received a Young Investigator Award from the NHLBI and the House Staff Teaching Award from UCSF. He became a sub-project PI on an NIH program project after three years as a faculty member and earned his first NIH R01 award one year later. His career-long record of lab-based research funding includes continuous support from the NIH from 1977 to 2017, often with simultaneous grants. This remarkable achievement includes multiple competitive grant renewals, as well as funding from non-federal agencies. Dr. Clyman's research studies are comprehensive. In order to understand the physiology and basic biology of ductus 44 www .aap.org/perinatal SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 function in humans, he developed innovative methodologies for studying the ductus of premature lambs and baboons. These studies included investigations at the cellular and molecular level, as well as comparison of cell- based results to ex vivo ductus preparations in organ bath contractility studies.In vivo studies in term and preterm animal models were then compared to results in preterm infants. His innovative work on metabolic alterations in the microenvironment of medial layers of the ductus wall provided the first evidence that hypoxia and energy failure are underlying events in normal closure as well as abnormal ductus patency. Over his career, Dr. Clyman's contributions have been repeatedly published in highly cited research journals, including J of Clinical Investigation, Journal of Immunology, Circulation, Circulation Research, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,and Nature Medicine,reflecting the strong impact of his work in our field. Beyond his accomplishments as a lab-based researcher, Dr. Clyman also initiated six different randomized clinical trials where fundamental lab-based observations were translated to the NICU bedside. These trials frequently involved enrollment of critically ill preterm infants to address key knowledge gaps in PDA management that neonatologists face on a daily basis. His ability to transform decades of pre-clinical research studies into clinically useful trials illustrates the sustained influence Dr. Clyman has had on management decisions that improve the health of countless newborn infants. For his career's-worth of work on the biology of the ductus arteriosus, Dr. Ronald Clyman is well deserving of the Landmark Award. Dr. Clyman will be presented with the 2019 Landmark Award at the Section on Neonatal Perinatal Medicine Program at the AAP NCE on Saturday, October 26, 2019 in New Orleans, LA. Jeff Reese 2019 Pioneer Awardee: Jacqueline Evans MD, FRCP(c), FAAP The Pioneer Award recognizes the pioneering achievements and contributions of an individual to the health and well-being of newborns and infants. The recipient of the 2019 Pioneer Award is Jacqueline Evans. Throughout her career, Dr. Evans has been committed to impacting the outcomes for ill neonates. However, it has been her vision and work with the Children's Hospital Neonatal Database that uniquely qualifies her for the Pioneer Award. Dr. Evans is the founding member of the Children's Hospital Neonatal Consortium (CHNC) which ultimately developed the Children's Hospital Neonatal Database (CHND). Her work in the development of this database will have an incredible impact on how we care for these unique neonatology patients. Dr. Evans is currently a Professor of Clinical Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Among many administrative roles, she has served as the Medical Director of the NICU and Neonatal ECMO Program at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). She is currently the Associate Division Chief and the Director of Quality and Patient Safety for the Division of Neonatology in the CHOP Newborn Care Network. Throughout her career, Dr. Evans has consistently focused on clinical outcomes research and is widely published in peer- reviewed journals. She has been recognized with multiple teaching awards and remains committed to providing mentorship to residents, fellows and junior faculty in neonatology. In 2006, Dr. Evans recruited a group of national neonatal clinical leaders to strategize about the development of a database that would focus on patients in referral-based children's hospitals neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). She recognized a gap in existing databases in determining patient outcomes and best practices for the quaternary NICU patient. As well, these patients have unique multidisciplinary and subspecialty needs. Following over 10,000 volunteer hours committed to database development and an established collaboration with Children's Hospital Corporation of America, 17 hospitals started the entry of data in 2010 within the CHND. In the past nine years, CHND involvement has grown internationally to include 34 children's hospitals NICUs, more than 180,000 patients, and has become the largest clinically valid data set for this unique patient population. Through the CHNC and CHND, seven multidisciplinary focus groups (BPD, ECMO, CDH, NEC, Mortality, Gastroschisis, HIE) and special interest groups have been developed. These groups have contributed to developing national guidelines and more than 20 peer-reviewed publications. The CHNC annual meeting continues to grow and in its 10th year was attended by 287 neonatologists, surgeons, nurse practitioners and data abstractors. CHNC is currently sponsoring its 5th National Quality Improvement Collaborative including over 20 CHNC hospitals. Previous collaborations have successfully decreased CLABSI rates among our children's hospitals NICUs, translating into tremendous cost savings for our hospitals. The multi- center QI groups continue a multidisciplinary collaboration with pediatric anesthesiologists and surgeons to optimize perioperative care for the surgical neonate. Throughout these years, what is clear is Dr. Evans' limitless ability to solve problems through an inclusive,45 www .aap.org/perinatal SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 generous, and collaborative approach. CHNC switched database vendors for CHND at the end of 2016. During that time, the organization began to contract with the 34 participating hospitals who were contributing to the database. Dr. Evans learned contract law to negotiate terms with each of the hospitals, managed communications with nearly every hospital's legal department, and successfully recruited all the participating hospitals to renew their CHND participation. This was all while mentoring faculty, organizing national meetings, training data coordinator/abstractors, and even fulfilling her clinical and heavy administrative duties at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The 2019 CHNC White Paper highlights the accomplishments of this non-profit group and database under the leadership of Dr. Evans. This database and national multidisciplinary collaboration would not be possible without the tireless commitment of Dr. Evans over the past 13 years. Her vision has been realized and because of her past and continued efforts, CHND has become an invaluable tool for neonatologists and children's hospitals to optimize the care for the complex critically ill neonate. Karna Murthy, Eugenia Pallotto, Anthony Michael Padula, Kris Reber, Billie Lou Short Essentials for Research Meeting Abstracts Ronald L Ariagno MD, FAAP, Chair Abstract Com - mittee for SOATT, Chair of Task Force for Neona - tal Perinatal Therapeutic Development Andrew O Hopper MD, FAAP This article is to provide some background for abstract committee chairs' consideration to develop a guideline for authors submitting abstracts and for abstract reviewers. A key reference for this article was Essentials of Writing Biomedical Research Papers,2nd Edition by M. Zeiger. In general, abstracts for meetings are intended to show the preliminary results of research, to draw the audience to a poster and/or platform presentation, to invite productive discussion of findings and potential significance with the authors(s) and audience. Details should be given to understand the methods used in the research and indicate the importance of the work. A table or graph may be used to present the most significant data and the Authors should avoid excessive details and abbreviations (e.g., no more than three) to improve clarity for the reviewer. There are four categories of Abstracts: (1)Hypothesis Testing, (2)Descriptive, (3)Methods, and (4)Case Reports. 1. Hypothesis Testing Research In this abstract the title should have both the independent and dependent variables (E.g. for studies with independent and dependent variables: \"The Effect of Racemic Epinephrine on Airway Function in Infants with Asthma;\" for studies with one dependent variable: \"The Effect of Darbepoetin on Term Neonates with Asphyxia\"). An outline for content of an abstract: Begin with background, state the question (hypothesis), the experiments that were done and the important details of the materials and methods used, results (give data only for the most important result which addresses the question and present % change rather than exact data when possible; state the result in a sentence before table or graph), state the answer to the question; provide implications, speculation or recommendation. 2. Descriptive Research The title should indicate the message or the message and the implication (E.g. \"Improved Educational Performance in Primary School for Extremely Low Birthweight (ELBW) Preterm Infants Who Had Received Caffeine for One Month\"). The abstract has three main parts in this order: The message, the results that support the message and the implication of the message. Because there is no hypothesis in descriptive abstracts the message is stated at the beginning. The results should provide data obtained by the investigators. A review of the literature and opinions about the subject are not a substitute for real data obtained in the research. 3. Methods Research The title of methods research should indicate whether the abstract describes a method, an apparatus, or a material; should state its purpose and should name the animal or population used. Include if the method is new, modified or improved (E.g. \"Novel Pneumotachometer for Measuring Minute Ventilation in Non-intubated Preterm Neonates with Chronic Pulmonary Insufficiency of Prematurity\"). Methods research abstracts describe new or improved methods, apparatus, device or materials or chemicals: Drugs, culture media, buffers, gases; molecules, cell lines, and tissues. The abstract should include: Name, purpose, how it works, advantages, how it was tested, how well it works and advantages; or Name, purpose, population, key features, advantage, how it was tested and how well it works. 4. Case Report As in the descriptive research abstract, the title in the case report should indicate the message and implication (E.g. Diagnosis of Congenital Syphilis in a Neonate Presenting as Direct Hyperbilirubinemia).46 www .aap.org/perinatal SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 The organization may follow the plan above in Descriptive Research, however, to be qualified for acceptance the case report should provide more than a description of what is already in the published literature or text books. Essentials of Writing Biomedical Research Papers is a valuable resource for reviewers and for those submitting abstracts. Abstract chairs should consider drafting a \"guideline\" that would include a numerical scoring system for reviewers to quantify the quality of the science, the importance of the scientific question, and the quality of the abstract. It may be worthwhile to also ask whether a course on writing biomedical papers and abstracts is needed for training programs. Furthermore, templates for writing various types of abstracts may be useful for authors to facilitate the presentation of preliminary results. Focus on Global Health: AAP Section on Neonatal Perinatal Medicine Global Health Subcommittee Danielle Ehret MD, MPH, FAAP Globally, the neonatal period represents the most vulnerable time for a child's survival. In 2017, 2.5 million deaths, or roughly 47% of all under-five deaths, occurred in newborns. The majority of the neonatal deaths are concentrated in the first day and week. This translates to 7000 newborn deaths every day and 98% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. The mission of our Section on Neonatal Perinatal Medicine (SoNPM) to improve the health and outcomes of the newborn infant does not reference the infants' countries of birth, appreciating our international responsibility and dedication, and our members demonstrate this commitment in their careers. There are now more SoNPM members participating in global health than at any time in history. AAP SoNPM Mission: To improve the health and outcomes of the newborn infant, as well as the pregnant woman and fetus and to collaborate with other organizations and non-profits which share the goal of improving the outcome of the newborn infant, as well as the pregnant mother and fetus through education, research, advocacy and the dissemination of knowledge of neonatal-perinatal pediatrics. Over the past decade, the SoNPM has contributed to global neonatal mortality reduction in significant ways, including leadership on the Helping Babies Survive curricula (Helping Babies Breathe, Essential Care for Every Baby, Essential Care for Small Babies, and Improving Care of Mothers and Babies: A Guide for Improvement Teams ). Following the successful launch of these programs, our members have increased tools to contribute to international partnerships, saving newborn lives and improving newborn care globally. Responding to a need voiced by SoNPM members for a \"home\" within the AAP for global newborn health, a committee was formed in November 2018 to establish a Global Health Subcommittee within SoNPM. Preliminary work, landscaping and focus groups were completed by Danielle Ehret, Beena Kamath-Rayne, Sharla Rent, Rachel Umoren, Jameel Winter and Carl Bose. Through the establishment of this Subcommittee, we seek to draw from the pool of almost 3500 neonatal perinatal medicine physicians in SoNPM, and provide a unique forum and opportunity to contribute collectively. Global Health Subcommittee Vision: To serve as partners in an international neonatal perinatal medicine community dedicated to improving the system, quality, experience and outcome of care for every newborn. The Subcommittee will serve as a forum to promote leadership in member-identified topics such as NPM fellowship global health experiences, and global health networking on career development, ethics, research and advocacy amongst members of TECaN, MidCaN, WECaN, and WiN. To join this Subcommittee and listserv, and further contribute to the development of its mission and objectives, we urge you to complete the SoNPM Global Health Subcommittee Membership Survey which will be sent through the SoNPM listserv. Please consider sharing your global health interests and experiences while enriching the academic and educational experiences of our entire Section on Neonatal Perinatal Medicine.

My interest in this disease began during my Pediatric residency, where I cared for premature infants, some of whom died from necrotizing enterocolitis. My patients, along with their families, left a lasting impression that has driven me to study this devastating disease. While the etiology of necrotizing enterocolitis is multifactorial, microbial dysbiosis plays an important role in its pathophysiology. Over the last decade, research has shed light on the intricate relationship between the gut microbiome and human health. My interest in the gut microbiome and its relationship to neonatal intestinal disease led to me seek mentorship from Dr. Rheinallt Jones, who is an expert in the field of host cell and probiotic microbe interactions. Through the guidance of my mentor, the members of his lab, Dr. Patricia Denning and Dr. Ravi Patel, I developed a murine model to study the antenatal effects of maternal diet on the neonatal microbiome and gut development. Since my research interest is in necrotizing enterocolitis, my research specifically focuses on studying the impact of antenatal diet on the offspring's capacity to respond to gut inflammation and injury. Brittany E Butler The Role of Perinatal Acetaminophen Exposure in Acute Lung Inflammation and Abnormal Pulmonary Development University of Colorado Denver Mentor: Clyde Wright Despite our advancing knowledge of the risk factors and pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), we have no safe and effective treatment. However, Maria Estefania Barbian Brittany E Butler 50 www .aap.org/perinatal SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 understanding the inflammatory signaling pathways that lead to abnormal lung development holds the promise to new therapies that will prevent this devastating disease. This is why I joined Dr. Clyde Wright's lab as a second-year pediatric resident and have continued this work in my neonatology fellowship. The overarching goal in our lab is to identify how innate immune NF B signaling leads to an injurious proinflammatory response in the neonatal lung. I am excited to use the lab techniques I have learned so far studying the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the neonatal lung and to acquire new skills as I begin to study the effects of acetaminophen in the developing lung. As clinicians are now frequently using acetaminophen in the NICU for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure, I am driven by the potential of this new work to better inform clinical decisions as we strive to provide the best possible care to preterm infants and their families. Sarah Nicole Cilvik The Role of Exogenous Glucagon in Growth and Metabolism in Late Gestation Fetal Lambs University of Colorado Denver Mentor: Paul Rozance I am a second-year Neonatal- Perinatal Medicine fellow at the University of Colorado with a research interest in fetal physiology, metabolism, and the hormonal control of development. I have been driven by my love and fascination of infants and science since a very young age, and by my freshman year in college, I was certain I wanted to pursue a career in neonatology. It was through this love of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine that I discovered my passion for research in Developmental Biology. My past research experiences have explored the effects of the pesticide malathion on zebrafish development (undergraduate honors thesis at Davidson College), as well as the role of fibroblast growth factor signaling in cardiac remodeling in the adult mouse heart (PhD in Developmental Biology at Washington University in St. Louis). The combination of my past research experiences with my clinical training in pediatrics led to an interest in the maternal-fetal relationship, specifically with relation to hormonal control of fetal metabolism and growth in the setting of growth restriction or maternal diabetes. As such, I identified the University of Colorado as the ideal location to complete my fellowship training under the mentorship of Dr. Paul Rozance, a leader in the field of fetal physiology. My research will investigate the impact of chronic hyperglucagonemia, which has been demonstrated in models of growth restriction and other types of fetal stress, on the growth and metabolism of a normally growing late gestation fetal lamb. This project will introduce novel and innovative intellectual concepts to further the understanding of fetal growth and nutrient processing and identify new targets for intervention in the setting of IUGR. The Marshall Klaus Neonatal-Perinatal Research Award will be instrumental to promote my successful transition from Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine Fellow to an independent physician scientist in the field of fetal physiology and metabolism. Julie Ann Dillard Effect of Nitric Oxide and Endothelial Cell-Smooth Muscle Cell Cross-talk on the Regulation of Phosphodiesterase 3 in Pulmonary Artery Smooth Muscle Cells Nationwide Children's Hospital Mentor: Bernadette Chen I am a second-year neonatology fellow at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, OH. My main research focus is neonatal pulmonary hypertension. Following residency, I spent time overseas as an active duty pediatrician in the US Air Force. During this time, I took care of many term newborns who became critically ill from persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, necessitating transport to a NICU. I developed a special interest in caring for these patients, and eventually applied to complete a neonatal- perinatal medicine fellowship. While my interest in pulmonary hypertension initially stemmed from these patient interactions, it eventually led me to work in the basic science lab of Dr. Bernadette Chen, where I have worked for the past two years of my fellowship. Specifically, we are investigating the regulation of phosphodiesterase 3 by the nitric oxide pathway, and its role in pulmonary hypertension in neonates. I believe that through research we have the potential to impact not only the lives of our current patients, but also of many future generations of patients. My career aspiration is to continue basic science research as a physician-scientist with the ultimate goal of discovering new and effective therapies in the treatment of neonatal pulmonary hypertension. Kristen Nicole Noble Defining the Roles of Fetal and Maternal Macrophages in Group B Streptococcal Ascending Chorioamnionitis Vanderbilt University Medical Center Mentor: David Aronoff As a current trainee in the Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine Fellowship program at Vanderbilt University, I am committed to pursue a career in academic medicine with a Julie Ann Dillard Sarah Nicole Cilvik 51 www .aap.org/perinatal SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 focus on basic and translational research for a very simple reason: I am determined that health status disparities be minimized. I am an African-American woman and mother who, statistically speaking, is at significantly higher risk of poor health outcomes overall. Unfortunately, despite advancement in health care capabilities, women and infants of color and those of low-income families are more likely to experience worse maternal and neonatal outcomes including significant long-term disability and even death. My intent, as an upcoming physician-scientist in Neonatology, is to contribute to the fundamental understanding of conditions that result in significant morbidity and mortality of neonates. My science career path started with training in cell biology at Meharry Medical College and Vanderbilt University, where I learned to appreciate mechanistic regulation of basic science processes. I then moved to the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis, TN where I completed my training in general Pediatrics and solidified my clinical interest in caring for the smallest and most fragile babies in the NICU. I have fused my passion with basic science and neonatology to study a problem directly related to maternal-child health, elucidating fundamental mechanisms of fetal membrane macrophages involved in bacterial chorioamnionitis, a significant driver of adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly in women of color. My long-term plan is to use my experiences from my clinical practice in the NICU to guide my laboratory work towards answering questions that will have the greatest impact on improving neonatal outcomes. My hope is that ultimately, this work will help meet the goal of ensuring that all women, regardless of background, have the best possible chance of having healthy babies with promising futures. Leeann Rebecca Pavlek Cardiovascular Contractility Deficits due to Adverse Perinatal Exposures Nationwide Children's Hospital Mentor: Lynette Rogers I am currently a second year Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine fellow at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. My clinical interest has always been neonatal cardiology and heart development, and I have been able to conduct basic science research in this field during my fellowship under the mentorship of Dr. Lynette Rogers. Other than structural heart disease, cardiac complications of prematurity are not well-recognized in the neonatal period, but premature birth is associated with higher rates of several cardiovascular morbidities later in life. I am studying the pathophysiology underlying the fetal and neonatal origins of adult cardiovascular disease, using a mouse model to discover molecular and functional changes that can be detected early in life. My project focuses on the increased rates of heart failure seen in former premature infants. My overall objective is to impact the clinical care of patients by identifying methods for early detection of infants at high-risk for heart disease in adulthood, which will allow for targeted surveillance, possible prevention, and prompt treatment of cardiac morbidities. Ultimately, my goal is to become an independent physician-scientist conducting basic and translational research studying the developmental origins of cardiovascular disease. Cynthia Nichole Schreiner Placental Proteins and Prematurity Children's Hospital Colorado Mentor: Theresa Powell I am currently a fellow in the Neonatal-Perinatal fellowship program at Colorado Children's Hospital. Throughout my career, clinical research has been an integral part in my overall development, but it was not until I started to study at Colorado Children's that the placenta, an organ which has recently received attention for being more than just a bystander during pregnancy, sparked my interest. Under the direction of Drs. Theresa Powell and Thomas Jansson, I developed and received IRB approval for a novel project that hypothesizes that the mortality and morbidities seen with prematurity today is due to the loss of factors secreted from the placenta to the fetus following discontinuation of the umbilical circulation with preterm delivery. We are currently undergoing active recruitment of mothers with infants 23 to 32 gestational weeks and collecting both cord blood at birth and neonatal blood at 2-3 days of life to evaluate this hypothesis. Once all samples have been collected, we will use a proteomic platform that will evaluate >1300 proteins to determine if proteins are secreted from the placenta at varying gestational ages. If this is seen, we will next evaluate if their concentration is significantly decreased following delivery. With the funding provided by this grant, my goal is to continue to advance my career in academics through strengthening my written and laboratory skills, ultimately leading to future investigations in medical research. Kristen Nicole Noble Leeann Rebecca Pavlek Cynthia Nichole Schreiner 52 Julie Du Thai The Role of Intestinal Inflammation on the Premature Intestinal Microbiome and Postnatal Growth Brigham and Women's Hospital Mentor: Katherine Gregory My early training in basic science led me to develop a keen interest in how the microbiome influences health outcomes during early life. This interest was magnified while I was a pediatric resident at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland. Now, as a neonatology fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, I am working to develop new means to study overall gut health during infancy, with a focus on how the microbiome influences clinical outcomes, such as preterm infant growth. Preterm infant growth outcomes, and in particular, growth failure, is one of the most common problems among preterm infants, impacting half of all preterm infants born today. Not only is this a common problem, it is one that has been persistent across decades, despite improved nutritional strategies. Focusing on gut health and intestinal biology, my overall goal is to identify novel therapeutic targets to optimize growth outcomes in this vulnerable population. Under the mentorship team led by Katherine Gregory, PhD at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, I will analyze fecal and urine biospecimens as well as clinical metadata from a previously hospitalized group of preterm infants to assess the influence of intestinal inflammation and the microbiome on growth outcomes. The Marshall Klaus Award will not only aid in the successful completion of this ambitious project but will also enable my goal in transitioning to an autonomous physician scientist. Christopher Stephen Thom Computational and Biochemical Investigation of Tropomyosin 1 and Other Genetic Regulators of Platelet Development Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Mentor: Benjamin Voight My long-term goal is to become a productive physician-scientist engaged in clinical neonatology, laboratory research, and teaching. I aim to use computational methods to rigorously analyze human genetic data, and test computationally-driven hypotheses using cellular and molecular approaches. Ultimately, I want to use genetic insights to make translational discoveries that improve human health. My current focus aims to identify genetic determinants of hematopoiesis. I used machine learning to identify putatively active genetic variation that impacts human platelet traits, and validated my findings in cellular models. Specifically, I found that Tropomyosin 1 deficient stem cells yield at least twice as many blood cells as controls. Going forward, I will (i) use computational analysis of human genetics and functional genomics data to identify modulators of hematopoiesis, (ii) develop cellular models and model systems to study modulators of hematopoietic development, with TPM1 as an exemplar candidate, and (iii) use these two experimental workflows to identify novel translational gene targets and therapeutic approaches to ameliorate hematopoietic disorders. Support from a Marshall Klaus Perinatal Research Award will help me pursue this research. Newborn Medicine Education Award Kinsey Marie Roth Letting Parents be Parents: A Medical Education Curriculum to Facilitated Parent Bedside Engagement and Family Integrated Care University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Mentor: Karena Lawrence I am a second year Newborn Medicine fellow at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center as well as a candidate in the Master of Medical Education program. A native of Colorado, I attended the University of Colorado as an undergraduate and later as a graduate student at the school of medicine. During these years, I cultivated a passion for education and an appreciation of its power as a social determinant and vital aspect of health. In medical school, I immediately joined our leadership, education, and advocacy track and dove into an issue rife with complex interplay of social determinants: insurance coverage. Under the mentorship of Dr Mark Earnest and Dr Steve Federico, I worked with the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative during the construction of Colorado's statewide health insurance marketplace. It was important for me that those who were uninsured, underinsured, or not receiving their due benefits (eg-children eligible but not yet covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program) would have easy access to information and guides to get them through the process. This experience led me into pediatrics, and I completed my general pediatrics residency at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. During residency I carried out a scholarly project entitled \"Roadmap to the NICU.\" Using key informant interviews of current NICU parents, I created a www .aap.org/perinatal SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 Christopher Stephen Thom Kinsey Marie Roth Julie Du Thai53 graphic-heavy workbook for families to track progress through the NICU and have a visual sense of closing in on the requirements for discharge. This extended time interviewing parents made me keenly aware of opportunities to improve the support of our NICU families. For me, taking care of my patient's family is part of providing care for my patient. Through education of staff and caregivers, my career goal is to advance the application of family integrated care practices and improve parental-self efficacy in the NICU. Health Research Services Awards Delia Marie Horn Association between Antenatal Ultrasound Findings and Neonatal Outcomes in Rural Uganda University of Vermont Medical Center Mentor: Danielle Ehret My interest in improving resource management and allocation in the low and middle-income country (LMIC) setting preceded my entry into medical training, and has remained a driving force behind my academic pursuits. In medical school I was awarded a Schweitzer Fellowship to design a curriculum introducing the American health care system to new Americans, which I then taught to Nepali-American refugees. In residency I participated in a pilot concordance study evaluating the utility of basic protocoled ultrasound sweeps for use in the LMIC setting. As a neonatal-perinatal medicine fellow and physician scientist in-training, I remain dedicated to initiatives that will improve the care provided to infants and families where resources are scarce. Throughout my career I hope to combine technological advances with quality improvement work in order to elevate the care that is available to LMIC residents, as well as those living in resource-limited areas within middle and high income countries. During my fellowship at the University of Vermont I have had the privilege to work with Dr. Danielle Ehret, Director of Global Health for Vermont Oxford Network, as my mentor. Guided by her experience and expertise, I intend to explore the utility of prenatal ultrasounds when performed in the LMIC setting. The goal of this work is to determine if certain ultrasound findings, when identified prenatally in the LMIC, are predictive of neonatal outcomes at delivery. Kathleen E Hannan Characterization, Disparities, and Prediction of Medical Complexity in VLBW Infants Discharged from the NICU University of Colorado Mentor: Sunah Susan Hwang As a current first year fellow at the University of Colorado, my research interests stem from caring for high-risk neonates, notably those with medical complexity and technology dependence. My passion in this area began in medical school and continued through residency, where I gained experience by working with NICU graduates with high medical needs through my weekly continuity clinic at our hospital's complex care clinic.

I hope to use this information as an early step towards disentangling the complex interactions of social, clinical, and hospital-level factors on discharge outcomes of VLBW infants. Not only will the Marshall Klaus Award help me to advance my current research, but it will also provide opportunities for education to support me on my path to becoming an academic neonatologist and an avid health services researcher.55 www .aap.org/perinatal SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 56 www .aap.org/perinatal SECTION ON NEONATAL-PERINATAL MEDICINE Summer 2019 SAVE THE DATE! 2020 WORKSHOP ON NEONATAL PERINATAL PRACTICE STRATEGIES Sponsored by the Section on Neonatal - Perinatal Medicine March 27-29, 2020 Paradise Valley DoubleTree Hotel Scottsdale, Arizona The 2020 Workshop will feature: A special one-half day Neonatal Coding Seminar L.
