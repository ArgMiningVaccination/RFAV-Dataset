Colorado State University General Catalog 2004-2006 The Colorado State University campuses are located in or near the city of Fort Collins. Th e county seat of Larimer County, this community of ap proximately 126,000 is locat ed 65 miles north of Denver on Interstate 25, and 45 miles south of Cheyenne, Wyoming. The city is served by railroad-freight and bus lines. Transportation from Fort Collins to Denver International Airport is provided by shuttle service. At the foot of the Rocky Mountains, Fort Collins is within an hour's drive of such major recreational areas as Estes Park, Red Feather Lakes, Horsetooth Reservoir, and severa l mountain parks, including the 790,000-acre Roosevelt National Forest and Rock y Mountain National Park. A wide variety of recreational activities is fostered not only by the presence of such areas but also by the climate in the Fort Collins region. Located at an elevation of 5,000 feet, Fort Collin s has a clear, dry atmosphere, over 300 days of sunshine and generally pleasant temperatures throughout the year. The summer temperature ranges from an average high of 85\u00b0 to an average low of 52\u00b0; the winter temperature ranges from an average high of 42\u00b0 to an average low of 13\u00b0. Indicative of the cultural life of Fort Collins are the museum, the public library, and civic symphony. An active University calendar - guest speakers, art exhibits, theater , cinema, concerts - adds to community life. This broad spectrum of cultural and outdoor recreational facilities, the ex cellent climate, and the mountain surroundings contribute toward making Fort Collins an ideal university setting.

Our University is committed to excellence in learning. We aim to provide learning opportunities that are accessible beyond the walls of the campus and to ensure all students enjoy the special benefits of studying at a major research university - in labs or in field experiences - working in close collaboration with faculty. This general catalog can o ffer insight into the breadth and depth of the educational offerings at our University, but descriptions of courses and majors only tell part of the story. Colorado State offers the kind of educational experience rarely found at major international research institutions. Here, we strive to create a challenging hands-on learning environment, where students have the opportunity to learn from top scholars and then put their classroom knowledge to work in unique and interesting ways. Whenever I meet with our students, I marvel at the stories they tell about their experiences inside and outside the classroom - running a real investment fund through our College of Business, traveling to Antarctica to conduct environmental research with faculty in the natural resources, supervising the operations of our Emmy-winning campus television station, working in a laboratory in the biomedical sciences, studying at our Pingree Park mountain campus, and much more. Their affection for this university and their pride in the work they're doing here are the real testament to the quality of a Colorado State education. This catalog is one of the best and most useful tools to aid you in determining your own path of excellence at Colorado State University. Again, welcome!

When the Territory became a State in 1876, the College was placed under the governance of the State Board of Agriculture. The College admitted its first students in 1879 and received designation that same year as Colorado's land-grant college under the Morrill Act of 1862. The Morrill Act provided federal endowment support for state institutions, where the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies, and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, in such manner as the Legislatures of the States may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life. Subsequent federal legislation led to the establishment of an Agricultural Experiment Station (1887) and Cooperative Extension Service (1914), while state legislation added responsibility for the Colorado State Forest Service (1955). Graduate study at Colorado State University (CSU) began about 1891, with the first master's degree awarded in 1893. At that time, and in the years that followed, a Committee on Advanced Degrees supervised graduate programs - until the Graduate School was organized in 1941. The veterinary medical program began granting degrees in 1904. Growth since World War II has been rapid; the University awarded its first doctorate in 1955. In 1935, the College became Colorado State College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts and in 1944 the name was changed to Colorado Agricultural and Mechanical College. In 1957, the name was changed to Colorado State University by action of the Colorado General Assembly, and it earned recognition by the North Central Association (NCA) of Colleges and Schools as a mature university in 1974. Colorado State, as a 21 st century land-grant university, has a fundamental mission to uphold. A 21st century land grant is a place where xScholarly discovery addresses real, felt needs of society; xThere are tangible benefits to citizens, business, and government from the blending of the discovery process with learning opportunities; xIn the great land-grant tradition, the intellectual resources of the university are brought to bear on the great, practical challenges of our time; and xWe recognize that the great challenges of the 21 st century are challenges that demand an integration of many different perspectives. Today, Colorado State is one of the leading public research universities in the United States, expending approximately $157M from externally funded contracts, grants and governmental sources in FY03, in addition to substantial non-funded scholarship and artistry. CSU's instructional programs cover the broad spectrum befitting a major, comprehensive state university. Excellent undergraduate and graduate programs are available in the various arts, sciences, humanities and professions. Total enrollment has grown to 25,000 plus regular, on-campus students. In 2002-2003, CSU granted 3,998 bachelor's degrees, 182 PhD degrees in 37 fields, and 1027 master's degrees in 63 fields. The Professional Veterinary Medicine (PVM) program awarded 132 DVM degrees. UNIVERSITY MISSION By statute, Colorado State University is a comprehensive graduate research university with selective admission standards. Charged with offering a comprehensive array of baccalaureate, master's and doctoral programs, it holds exclusive statewide authority for programs in agriculture, forestry, natural resources, and veterinary medicine. Colorado State University has a unique mission in the state of Colorado. The land-grant concept of a balanced program of teaching, research, extension, and public service provides the foundation for the University's teaching and research programs, Agricultural Experiment Station, Cooperative Extension, and Colorado State Forest Service. The University has long been a leader in recognizing the rapidly changing global environment, and has a commitment to excellence in international education in all its instructional, research, and outreach programs. The University continues to make education and training accessible to deserving applicants from all classes and groups, and maintains a wide range of research, extension, and public service programs in response to the needs of the people of Colorado, the nation, and the world.

Broadening Your Horizons 8Summer Session Office in Natural and Environmental Science Building, Room A317 Barbara Gotshall, Director (970) 491-1590 www.summer.colostate.edu There are many opportunities for students at Colorado State University in the summer session. Students who wish to take courses during the summer session only do not have to be formally admitted to the University. There is a great selection of classes with over 500 courses from which to choose. Summer school is convenient: courses are accelerated (offered in 4- and 8-week terms with several mini-courses available) giving students the flexibility to work and make other summer plans. It's a suitable time to complete a prerequisite, take a required course, improve one's GPA, or use the season for professional development; lighten a course load for another term. Summer is an appealing time. The campus atmosphere is laid-back and hassle-free. The classes are generally smaller. It's a time when students can focus on one or two classes. New freshmen and transfer students enjoy summer classes as a way to transition to the University. Returning teachers pursue advanced study and graduate students conduct research during the summer session. Academic departments sponsor a variety of institutes, conferences, and workshops. Pre-college programs for high school students and youth programs are available on campus during the summer months. A visit to the Summer Session homepage provides a taste of the University's summer activities. Requests for the Summer Class Schedule can be made from the summer homepage or by calling the request line at (970) 491-7985. An on-line summer schedule can also be found atwww.summer.colostate.edu .

Additional information may be found at http://admissions. colostate.edu /freshmen/faq_homeschool.shtml. . College-Level Courses Completed by High School Students Colorado State credit may be allowed for college-level courses completed at a college or university while a student is still in high school if the following conditions are met: 1. The college or university must be fully accredited by one or the six regional associations or schools and colleges. Credit will be granted only for academic courses. 2. An official transcript must be provided by the college or university showing the courses completed. The College Board Advanced Placement Program The Advanced Placement Tests administered by The College Board are used by the University to award credit and advanced placement in any of several fields in which a student may have participated in high school. Credit awarded is treated as transfer credit without a grade but is counted toward graduation and may be used in fulfilling specific curriculum requirements. Credit is granted for scores of four or five on the Advanced Placement Tests in government and politics, biology, computer science, English, environmental science, and human geography. Credit is granted in art, chemistry, economics, French, German, history, Latin, mathematics, music, physics, psychology, Spanish, and statistics for scores of three or higher. Scores of one and two are not granted credit. See the website, www.registrar.colostate.edu , use the link \"Transfer Office,\" for a complete table indicating those courses for which credit is awarded. College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) The College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) was designed by The College Board to enable both traditional and nontraditional students to receive college-level credit by examination. There are two types of examinations offered - the General Examinations and the Subject Examinations. Information may be obtained and arrangements for taking the tests by contacting the University Testing Service, C81 Clark Building, or by writing to The College Board, Box 1822, Princeton, NJ 08541-6601 for a list of test centers. Credit awarded for these examinations cannot be used in meeting the Colorado State residency requirement for the baccalaureate degree. General Examinations The General Examinations measure college-level achievement in five basic areas of the liberal arts: English composition, humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, and social science-history. The test material usually covered in the first two years of college is often referred to as the general or liberal education requirement. Therefore, if a student takes a college-level course in a particular area, credit will not be allowed for the CLEP General Examination covering that area. Prior to July 1, 2001, students scoring 500 or higher are awarded a minimum of three semester credits for each examination or a maximum of 30 semester credits for all five examinations. Beginning July 1, 2001, students scoring 50 or higher on a computer-based examination are awarded a minimum of three semester credits for each examination or a maximum of 30 semester credits for all five examinations. Credit granted is based on the following test scores: Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

Undergraduate Admissions Policy and Procedures 13General Examinations (Prior to July 1, 2001 ) (Beginning July 1, 2001 ) 500-574 = 3 semester credits 50-57 = 3 semester credits 575-649 = 4 semester credits 58-65 = 4 semester credits 650-724 = 5 semester credits 66-72 = 5 semester credits 725-800 = 6 semester credits 73-80 = 6 semester credits Credit granted on the basis of the General Examinations will be treated as general elective transfer credit without a grade but will count toward graduation. Credit granted cannot be used to meet the University written communication or mathematics requirements. Subject Examinations The Subject Examinations measure achievement in specific college courses and are used to grant exemption from and credit for these courses. Students scoring equal to or greater than the mean scaled score prior to July 1, 2001, on a specific Subject Examination are granted credit in the amount allowed for the Colorado State equivalent course(s). Students who are enrolled in or who have successfully completed a course at a higher level may not receive credit for a lower prerequisite. See the website, www.registrar.colostate.edu and use the link \"Transfer Office\" for a list of the Subject Examinations for which Colorado State credit will be granted. International Baccalaureate Students who graduate from high school with an International Baccalaureate or have completed International Baccalaureate examinations may receive University credit for scores of four or higher. The website, www.registrar.colostate.edu and the \"Transfer Office\" link lists the courses for which credit will be granted. For Non-High School Graduates 1. Submit transcripts showing all completed high school and collegiate courses. 2. Submit scores from the General Educational Development (GED) Test. 3. Submit evidence of competence in mathematics comparable to that indicated by successful completion of high school courses customarily titled algebra I, geometry, and algebra II. Examples of acceptable evidence of the required competence in mathematics include satisfactory completion of high school courses, completion of a college course in intermediate algebra with a grade of B or above, or satisfactory performance on the Colorado State University Entry Level Mathematics Exam. 4. Submit scores from either the ACT (American College Test Program) or the SAT of The College Board. ACT/SAT scores are not required of applicants who are 23 years of age or older or who have been out of high school five or more years. The admission decision is based on the student's academic potential for attaining a degree at Colorado State. In special cases, students otherwise well-qualified, but not meeting all requirements, are considered for admission on a case-by-case basis. For Transfer Students Undergraduate students who have graduated from high school and completed more than twelve credits at other accredited institutions must apply as transfer students. Those who were enrolled in high school and took college-level course work concurrently (regardless of the number of credits attempted) or those who have completed twelve or fewer credits after high school must apply for admission as freshmen (see \"For High School Graduates\" above). Grade Point Average Requirements Students who have completed an Associate of Arts or an Associate of Science degree from an accredited Colorado institution will be guaranteed University admission providing that it is the last institution attended and that a cumulative 2.0 GPA (on a 4. 0 scale) has been achieved from ALL institutions attended. Entry into a specific major may be dependent on completion of appropriate prerequisite courses and enrollment limitations of the major. Students who have not yet completed an Associate's degree but who have earned more than twelve collegiate semester credit hours, may be considered for regular admission provided they have a minimum cumulative transfer grade point average of 2.5 and all other entrance requirements have been satisfied. Application Process for Transfer Students 1. Submit official transcripts of all collegiate work attempted. Transcripts must show all work attempted from each university or college attended. No part of the previous collegiate record may be disregarded. Failure to list all institutions previously attended is a serious offense that may cancel admission or enrollment and result in loss of credit . Course work taken at vocational-technical institutes or non-accredited colleges generally is not counted toward the minimum number of credits required for admission of transfer students. 2. Transfer students currently registered at another institution must submit a list of courses indicating those in which they are presently enrolled and those in which they will enroll prior to entering Colorado State. 3. Transfer students must meet the admission requirement in mathematics. This requirement may be met by completing a transferable mathematics course (e.g., College Algebra) with a grade of C or higher, OR completing intermediate algebra with a grade of B or higher, OR completing algebra I, geometry, algebra II Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

Undergraduate Admissions Policy and Procedures 14(or a comparable math sequence) with grades of C or higher while in high school, OR achieving a satisfactory score on the Colorado State University Entry Level Mathematics Exam, OR by submitting other credible evidence of adequate preparation of university-level mathematics courses. 4. Submit high school transcripts to determine if course work requirements have been met while attending high school. 5. Plan to complete college composition and college math requirement before enrolling at Colorado State University. These two graduation requirements must be satisfactorily completed within the student's having completed 60 credits total (including both transfer credits and Colorado State University credits - only one semester extension will be allowed once a student enters Colorado State). Because of demand, admission to some programs of study is more competitive than others; admission to these programs is limited to students presenting the strongest academic credentials. For example, students applying to the College of Engineering must have completed at least one term of calculus and one term of calculus-based physics or chemistry prior to enrolling. Preference will be given to those applicants with the strongest records in pre-engineering programs Applicants are granted admission on the basis of their previous academic and conduct records, the appropriateness of their previous courses to their proposed program of study, and the availability of space in the program. Admission is subject to satisfactory completion of current courses and submission of a final, complete, official transcript. Priority will be given to students who demonstrate the greatest academic potential for attaining a degree at Colorado State. In special cases, students otherwise well-qualified, but not meeting all of these requirements, are considered for admission on a case-by-case basis. Evaluation of Credits Colorado State maintains transfer guides with all community colleges in Colorado. Each guide consists of policies and practices for the acceptance of college credit, a list of courses which transfer to Colorado State, and an outline of academic programs. Students contemplating transfer are encouraged to meet with transfer advisers at their current institution as early as possible. The Transfer Evaluation Office is responsible for determining routine course equivalencies for all courses that meet the All-University Core Curriculum (AUCC) requirements. Students should be aware that credits may transfer to the University, but not count toward department graduation requirements. Evaluation of credits is made only from official transcripts after a student has been granted admission. Regular academic courses completed with a grade of C- or better are generally accepted in transfer. Transfer grades and credits are not computed within the cumulative GPA earned at Colorado State. Transfer Equivalency Source (T.E.S.) T.E.S. (Transfer Equivalency Source) is a database of selected accredited institutions in the U.S., their courses and how those courses will transfer to Colorado State University. All public institutions in Colorado and Wyoming are part of this database and, in addition, many frequently transferred courses from selected institutions in other states are also listed. Access this database by going to the website www.registrar.colostate.edu and clicking on T.E.S. If a particular institution is not listed, contact the Transfer Evaluation Office for evaluation of specific courses. Statewide Guaranteed Transfer Program The state of Colorado has developed a statewide guaranteed transfer program, which applies to all Colorado public institutions of higher education, which includes Colorado State University. There are more than 300 lower-division general education courses in 20 subject areas approved for guaranteed transfer. After starting on your higher education pathway at any public college or university in Colorado, and upon acceptance to another, you can transfer up to 35 to 37 credits of previously and successfully (C- or better) completed guaranteed transfer general education coursework. These courses will transfer and continue to apply toward your general education core or graduation requirements for any of our bachelor's degree programs. You will find extended detail on the Colorado Commission for Higher Education (CCHE) web site at http://'www.state.co.us/cche/gened/ gtpathways/index.pdf . You may also reference Colorado State University's site at www.state.co.us/cche/ ; you should click on Students & Parents, then on General Education/Transfer. Transfer Appeals Process Students may appeal a deci sion regarding the transferability of a specific course(s) and/or the decision regarding how it is used to fulfill degree requirements. Any appeals should first be directed to the Transfer Evaluation Office in the Registrar's Office in 100 Administration Annex. The student is responsible for supplying any supporting documentation from the student's transferring college along with the appeal, such as a syllabus or more detailed course description. The Transfer Evaluation Office will either satisfy the student's request or refer the student to an academic department for additional consideration. If the academic department cannot fulfill the request, a formal written appeal may be presented to the Transfer Evaluation Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

Undergraduate Admissions Policy and Procedures 15Office in 100 Administration Annex for presentation to the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Studies for final decision. 60-Credit Rule for Mathematics and Composition Colorado State has a requirement that all students must complete their math and composition credits within 60 credits. More complete information on this policy may be found in the chapter on the All-University Core Curriculum (AUCC) of this catalog. Transfer credits do count toward this 60-credit rule. Students transferring 40 or more credits into CSU, are advised that the math and composition requirements should either be met from transfer credits or are to be completed in the first semester at CSU. Credit from Two-Year Colleges 1. A maximum of 64 semester credits may be accepted in transfer from two-year colleges accredited by one of the six regional associations of schools and colleges. 2. Credit earned at a two-year college may not be used to meet the upper-division (300-400 level) graduation requirement. Departments may allow substitution of course work from two-year colleges towards specific major upper-division requirements. 3. Advising guides are available for students who complete 60 credits at a community college and want to complete a four-year degree at Colorado State in another 60 credits for selected degrees. See www.registrar.colostate.edu . Service Schools and Courses of the Armed Services Credit may be allowed for those service schools with baccalaureate credit recommendation in the latest Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services prepared by the American Council on Education. Individual departments determine whether those courses clear major curriculum requirements or may be used as elective credit. Evaluations of service school training are made only for currently enrolled students. Transfer Credit from Non-Collegiate Institutions Colorado State will award transfer credit for academic work done under the sponsorship of non-collegiate institutions, if 1) the courses proposed for transfer have been approved by the American Council on Education, 2) are listed in The National Guide to Educational Credit for Training Programs , and 3) are approved by the department and college in which the subject matter is taught at Colorado State. Those wishing to request such transfers should contact the Degree and Transfer Evaluation Office. For Former Colorado State Students Former Colorado State students who have not attended another institution since attending Colorado State must file an application for readmission. Students who have withdrawn prior to the end of a semester must also file an application for readmission. A $50 (subject to change) nonrefundable processing fee must accompany the application for admission for students who were not regularly enrolled during the previous year. Students are readmitted if they are eligible to return to the University and if space is available. Students who have attended other collegiate institutions after attending Colorado State must file an application for readmission with the $50 (subject to change) nonrefundable processing fee, transcript(s) of all courses attempted at the transfer institution(s), and a list of courses that will be completed prior to entering Colorado State. The admission decision is based on previous Colorado State work and the student's academic performance at transfer institutions and if space is available. For Those Seeking a Second Bachelor's Degree Acceptance to work toward a second bachelor's degree is contingent upon completion of a first bachelor's degree and fulfillment of regular admission requirements as well as receipt of favorable recommendations by the appropriate college and/or department. Requirements for a second bachelor's degree include the following: 1. A minimum of 30 semester credits in residence in addition to the minimum number of credits required for the first degree. 2. All curriculum requirements for the major including All-University Core Curriculum requirements (see that section of this catalog). The first baccalaureate degree from an institution accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education, the Council for Higher Education Accrediting, or equivalent will fulfill the All-University Core Curriculum (AUCC) requirements with the exception of those AUCC courses (including category 4 courses) that are required in the major. Students seeking second bachelor's degrees cannot declare second majors.

Undergraduate Admissions Policy and Procedures 16For U.S. Citizens Educated Overseas Note: Also refer to section \"Application Information for All Applicants\" above. Colorado State recognizes that the pool of U.S. citizens educated abroad covers a wide spectrum, including students with dual citizenship who have never been to the U.S. and U.S.-born students who have lived in multiple countries or who have only recently moved overseas as the result of family military or employment assignments. Applicants who are U.S. citizens who have been educated in part or wholly overseas should submit the domestic application for admission and follow the application instructions according to the appropriate academic status listed above (high school graduate, non-high school graduate, transfer student). The admission decision will include a review of the student's personal background and educational circumstances to determine whether additional support information is required to assess the student's potential for academic success at the University. For example, a student whose native language is not English and who has had all education in a language other than English may be asked to provide English proficiency documentation and a translation of academic records. U.S. citizens (or permanent residents) who have been educated abroad may be eligible for financial aid and scholarships. Refer to Financial Assistance in the Financial Services for Students chapter for more information. For International Students Note: Also refer to section \"Application Information for All Applicants\" above and see the section for International Student and Scholar Services in the International Programs and Services chapter. The initial inquiry about admission should indicate the applicant's academic background, proposed program of study, and the source and amount of financial support for study at Colorado State. The applicants are required to submit the Certificate for Issuance of Immigration Document and financial support statements for immigration processing. All international applicants, except for those whose native language is English and for whom the language of instruction is English, are required to demonstrate a high level of English proficiency. While alternative English language proficiency measurements may be considered for conditional admission, the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) and the IELTS (International English Language Testing Service) exams are preferred. To be considered for clear (unconditional) admission, applicants must present strong academic preparation and a minimum TOEFL score of 197 on the computer-based exam (525 on the paper-based exam) or a minimum IELTS exam score of 6. To be considered for conditional admission, applicants must present strong academic preparation and a minimum TOEFL score of 130 on the computer-based exam (450) on the paper-based exam) or a minimum IELTS exam score of 5. Freshmen must: 1. Demonstrate a high level of English proficiency. 2. Submit official secondary school transcripts and/or school leaving certificate(s). If transcripts are not in English, a certified English translation must also accompany each document. Transfer students must: 1. Submit official transcripts of all university or college courses taken in the United States or abroad. 2. Submit secondary school transcripts and/or school leaving certificate(s). If transcripts are not in English, a certified English translation must also accompany each document. 3. Demonstrate a high level of English proficiency.

The tuition rates which apply to any succeeding fiscal year will not be known until June of each year. The Board of Governors of the Colorado State University System, therefore, reserves the right to change tuition and fee schedules and related policies, including the time, date, and method for payment, at any time. Schedule of Tuition and Fees The most current listing of tuition and fees will be found at www. registrar.colostate.edu . In addition to the charges listed under each category, students may pay special course fees. Tuition and fees for a student registering for a combination of regular on-campus courses or continuing education courses will be assessed individually according to the schedule established for each. Students who are off campus for full-time internships, practica, and professional affiliations, and are not concurrently enrolled in other on-campus experiences or courses, will be assessed a reduced student fee. Tuition and Fee Adjustments Registration Cancellation Before classes begin for a particular term, all courses can be canceled via the Web registration system (RAMweb) with no charge. Registration Changes Tuition and fees will be adjusted for undergraduate students that go above or below the 9 credit assessment cut-off during the schedule change period at the beginning of the semester. Specific dates are listed in the on-line class schedule. After this deadline, there is no adjustment in tuition and fees if a student drops part of his or her schedule.University Withdrawal Once classes begin, students dropping all courses and leaving the University must contact the Center for Advising and Student Achievement (CASA), Aylesworth Hall NE, Room 201. Adjustments of tuition and fees will be made on a pro-rated basis according to the following chart: Withdrawal Assessment for Fall and Spring1 Withdraw in Week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10% 15% 20% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% Withdraw in Week 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 60% 65% pro-rated tuition and fees adjustments may be made in the following situations: 1. Withdrawing students who received financial aid are subject to specific federal, state, and University withdrawal policies regarding tuition and fees, housing charges, refunds to financial aid programs, and repayments resulting from their withdrawal. A withdrawal may require an immediate refund of financial aid fund programs. Refunds are calculated according to Student Assistant General Provisions regulations. The date of a student's withdrawal, financial aid disbursements to the student's account, University charges, and payments by the student or a third party are used to calculate the refund amount. If a student withdraws a cash balance from his or her student account to use for living expenses, the student may have to repay those funds which are in excess of an amount determined to be reasonable for their length of enrollment. All calculated refunds and repayments will be allocated to financial aid programs first, and any remaining amount to the student. 2. No financial adjustment will be made for a student who is suspended, dismissed, or expelled for breach of discipline. 3. University room and board charges will be assessed through the vacate date from University housing. 4. In the case of a student death, a refund of tuition and fees may be made any time during the semester. 1Summer term has a different assessment schedule and the withdrawal policy is in the Summer Class Schedule.

Students enrolled for nine or more credits are considered full time for tuition and fee purposes and required to pay the full amount according to their college affiliation. Part-time undergraduate and graduate students pay a prorated amount.Special Course Fees Certain courses require enrolled students to pay fees for special services and/or materials. Since the costs are determined annually in June, courses with fees are indicated by ($) in the Courses of Instruction section of this catalog. For the most current listing of special course fees, visit the Provost/Academic Vice President Web page at www.provost.colostate.edu/index.asp?url=ug_stud ies For some courses enrolled students are assessed a uniform fee during registration to cover the costs incurred by the University to offer the courses. These costs include the rental of external facilities, the expenses of field placements, the provision of special facilities of a personal nature that the University would not otherwise maintain, and/or the costs of off-campus travel of students with supervising faculty members. For some courses enrolled students are assessed variable fees by the department based upon actual use of expended materials supplied by the department and used by the student in the creation, construction, and/or fabrication of an object of value, such as a class project that becomes the student's property. The assessed amount is based upon actual use of expendable materials supplied by the department because of the inability to make individual purchases economically. For some courses enrolled students are assessed variable fees by the department based upon actual damage or non-return of equipment used in the courses. All special course fees will be assessed and collected through normal student accounts receivable procedures. No fees should be paid directly to academic departments or individuals. Tuition for Continuing Education Courses Tuition and fees assessed for courses offered by the Division of Continuing Education vary by program, level of instruction, and delivery mode.

Financial Services for Students 19Additional Expenses Personal and Living Expenses The amount of money spent by a student in an academic year (two semesters\u2014August to May) for personal and living expenses varies with current prices and the habits and needs of the student; therefore, it is difficult to estimate the amount of money needed by individual students for such items as entertainment, laundry, and clothing. Expenses not directly related to educational costs are not included in the estimates. Example of Estimated Yearly Expenses (based on 2003-2004 figures) The following estimate of student costs, exclusive of tuition and fees, is based on a minimum but adequate standard. Students' actual expenses may be lower or higher, since these are only estimates. Certain courses carry a special course fee in addition to the regular tuition and fees. Total Per Academic Year Semester (Two Semesters) Living Allowance $ 3022 $ 6045 Books and Supplies $ 450 $ 900 Personal Expenses $ 1000 $ 2000 Total Estimated Costs $ 4472 $ 8945 Health Insurance The University administers an optional health insurance plan for students at a reasonable rate. This insurance is in addition to the Hartshorn Health Service program funded by student fees. Insurance is not a prerequisite to the use of the Hartshorn Health Service, but is designed to supplement it and to help protect against the high medical costs of an accident or sickness requiring hospitalization. This insurance plan provides additional coverage for any family plan; it provides primary coverage when no other plan is involved. The plan is optional; however, students are encouraged to enroll unless they already have adequate health insurance. Information on student health insurance is contained in the Student Health Insurance brochure which is available to all new students. Housing Deposit Residence Halls The housing deposit for residence hall students serves as both a reservation fee and a contractual guarantee. A partial refund of this deposit is available if the applicant cancels his/her request in writing prior to the date the residence halls open for the semester. For specific information about the refund policy, refer to the \"Contract/Refund Information\" outlined in the Housing and Dining Services booklet which accompanies the Residence Hall Application form. University Apartments A deposit is required for students applying for university apartments. This deposit serves as an application fee and a contractual guarantee. The deposit will be refunded, upon request, any time prior to si gning an apartment contract. The refund procedure for current apartment residents is outlined in the Apartment Life Contract Agreement. For further information, refer to the Housing and Dining Services booklet which accompanies the University Apartment Application form. Full-Time/Half-Time Enrollment Status Enrollment status (full-time, half-time) is determined by the number of credits which the student has completed or is pursuing for the term in which the certification is requested. Courses from which the student has withdrawn or is auditing are not included. (The following schedule for enrollment status differs from the full-time/part-time schedule for tuition and fees. See the Registrar's Web site, www.registrar.colostate.edu .) Credit requirements are as follows: Semesters: Undergraduates 12 or more credits Half-time credits Graduates Full-time 9 or more credits Half-time 5-8 credits Summer Session: Undergraduates Full-time 6 or more credits Half-time 3-5 credits Graduates Full-time 5 or more credits Half-time 3-4 credits For verification of enrollment status, term(s) of attendance, or degree awarded, go to www.ramweb.colostate.edu. For other verifications contact Records and Registration in 100 Administration Annex. Graduate Assistants Full-time graduate assistants receive a minimum monthly stipend during the academic year, as set by the University. Such assistants must register for and complete at least one on-campus credit during each fall and spring semester during which the assistantship is in effect; and such credits as the appointing department may require each summer term during which the appointment is in effect. Assistants may have tuition payments made in their behalf. Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

Financial Services for Students 20IN-STATE RESIDENCY FOR TUITION CLASSIFICATION PURPOSES Student Financial Services Office in Administration Annex, Room 103 (970) 491-6321 www.sfs.colostate.edu Classification of students for tuition purposes is governed by state statute (\"tuition law\") which sets forth conditions for a student being considered as \"in state\" fo r purposes of tuition classification. The tuition law is contained in sections 23-7-101 to 104, and 23-7-105 of the Colorado Revised Statutes. Although individuals may be considered state residents for voting or other legal purposes after being in the state for a short period of time, the tuition law specifies additional requirements for classification as \"in-state\" for tuition purposes. The tuition law, which applies to all public institutions of higher education in Colorado, is subject to judicial interpretation and change at any time by the Colorado Legislature. Colora do State University must apply the rules set forth in the Colorado Revised Statutes, and is not free to make exceptions except as specifically permitted under the Statute. Definition of \"In-State Residency\" Under the Colorado tuition law, the term \"in-state\" student means: \"A student who has been domiciled in Colorado for one year or more immediately preceding the first day of classes for the term for which such status is claimed.\" Further the tuition law states: \"Attendance at an institution of higher education, public or private, within the state of Colorado shall not alone be sufficient to qualify for domicile in Colorado.\" \"Domicile\" is the legal term used to describe the place where a person has chosen to make a true and fixed permanent home. \"Domicile\" includes both physical presence and intent, and must be established for 12 months prior to the first day of class. A student can only establish domicile in Colorado for tuition purposes if s/he intends to reside permanently in the state, and meets the definition of a \"Qualified Person.\" The initial tuition classification is determined from information provided by student/parent on the residency section of the admissions application. The University, in making this determination, may also consider relevant information contained in any other University educational records. Failure to answer all questions on the admissions application could lead to initial classification as \"non-resident.\"Petition for Reclassification A petition may be filed if a student wishes to contest out-of-state classification or if s/he has subsequently become eligible for in-state status. Petition materials and a copy of the Colorado Revised Statutes may be obtained from Student Financial Services. Petitions will be processed only for students who have been admitted to the University and currently enrolled for the semester they are requesting a change in classification. The petitioner's classification will remain non-resident until he or she has received notification from the Tuition Classification Officer indicating a residency change has been approved. Students who are petitioning for residency remain responsible for paying their student account based upon their current tuition classification status at the time of billing. Petition Deadline Student Financial Services must receive completed petitions no later than their published deadline date for each term. Petitions submitted after the deadline dates or uncompleted petitions will not be accepted for review for that term and will result in tuition assessment as a non-resident for that term. It is the responsibility of the petitioner to submit a completed petition in a timely manner and no later than the deadline date. To obtain a copy of the deadline dates for any semester, contact Student Financial Services or look for information on the Student Financial Services Web site at www.sfs.colostate.edu. Appeal of Classification Decisions made by the Tuition Classification Officer are subject to appeal to the Residency Appeals Committee. A student wishing to appeal a decision should contact Student Financial Services for instruction. Appeals must be submitted in writing, to Student Financial Services no later than 2 weeks (10 class days) after the date of the letter in which the decision is conveyed to the petitioner. The decision of the Residency Appeals Committee is the final University determination for that specific term. Detailed information on tuition classification and copies of the Tuition Classification Statutes are available on request from Student Financial Services and on the Student Financial Services Web site at www.sfs.colostate.edu. Any student who provides false information to avoid paying \"non-resident\" tuition may be subject to legal and/or disciplinary action.

Bookin-Weiner, Executive Director (970) 491-5917 www.international.colostate.edu The Office of International Programs acts as a catalyst for ideas that bring about internationalization and institutional change and identifies resources to support international programs and initiatives on campus. Its programs and services have an impact on teaching, learning, research, outreach, and the campus environment. The goals of its activities are to encourage students to graduate from CSU with a broader outlook on the world by participating in courses with international content, study abroad experiences, and other activities on campus. In fulfilling its mission, the Office of International Programs brings Colorado State University recognition as a model of effective, innovative and student-centered institutional internationalization. It does so through a collaborative process that makes international activity integral to the University's instructional, student service, research and outreach programs, and to the experience of the University's students. The office is organized into four functional units: xInternational Education; xInternational Research, Development, and Training; xStudy Abroad; and xInternational Student and Scholar Services. International Education Office in Laurel Hall Martha A. Denney, Director Colorado State University encourages students and faculty to gain knowledge for living and working in an increasingly internationalized and interdependent world.

Graduate students may engage in educational activities abroad as a part of their plan of study through specific pre-arranged programs that are sanctioned by Colorado State University and are prearranged with the students' graduate committee and International Education. In some instances students participate in short-term study abroad, or research with cooperating institutions. Nationally competitive scholarship programs for graduate study abroad are facilitated through International Education. The programs include, but are not limited to, the Fulbright Graduate Study Program, the Boren National Security Education Program (NSEP), and the Rotary Ambassadorial Scholarship Program. Information on scholarships for overseas study is located in the International Resource Room located in the Office of International Programs, Laurel Hall. Opportunities are also listed on the international programs bulletin at www.international.colostate.edu . Other Opportunities Weekly seminars, special programs such as exhibits, special speakers, and cultural programs are also offered to assist students in advancing their international educational goals. International Research, Development, and Training Office in Laurel Hall Colorado State University has a long history of involvement in international development assistance projects around the world. Faculty and staff develop proposals and serve in other countries on both short- and long-term assignments. Past activities have featured water resources and agriculture. However, the current focus of international research, development, and training activities is changing towards environmental issues, public health, business management, civil society and education. Colorado State University also offers a variety of short courses and non-degree training programs in a broad range of disciplines. In general, the clientele for these programs are international scholars, scientists, or technicians who need focused training in specific areas. Short courses are offered on the Colorado State campus and in other countries. More comprehensive non-degree training programs are offered through the colleges; the Center for Science, Mathematics and Technology Education; the International School for Natural Resources; and the International School for Water Resources and associated programs. These training programs may involve up to one year of residence at Colorado State University. For more information regarding short courses and non-degree training programs, contact the Office of International Programs. Study Abroad Office in Laurel Hall Kara Bingham, Director Study abroad opportunities are central to Colorado State University's international mission. Study abroad actively engages students in an international arena and allows them to gain new perspectives on their studies, to broaden their knowledge of international affairs, and to deepen their understanding other cultures. In addition to enhancing a student's degree program, study abroad provides students with direct experience developing intercultural skills necessary for success in an increasingly diverse and globally interdependent workforce. The Study Abroad unit of the Office of International Programs manages Colorado State University's study abroad and reciprocal exchange programs throughout the world. Study Abroad advisers provide individual and group advising to students on educational opportunities abroad, program selection, financial aid, scholarships, and credit transfer. In addition, Study Abroad offers support services such as pre-departure orientations, workshops for returnees, and serves as the student's primary liaison to other campus offices while abroad. All students considering study abroad are required to work with study abroad advisors in the Office of International Programs in preparation for their time abroad. Advance planning helps assure that study abroad programs will not unnecessarily prolong the period of time needed to get a degree. Advance planning also assures that students meet application deadlines which can range anywhere from two months to eighteen months before a program begins. Credit from approved study abroad programs may be applied towards a students' overall degree program at Colorado State. Students participating in an approved study abroad program, even those sponsored by another institution or organization, register in the study abroad course (SACC 482V) and pay an administrative charge. Registration in SACC 482V maintains the student's full-time enrollment at Colorado State, allows for the release of financial aid to cover program costs, and fulfills the All-University Core Curriculum Global and Cultural Awareness requirement. Further information on eligibility requirements, deadlines, policies, procedures, financial aid, and costs related to study abroad may be found at http://www.studyabroad. colostate.edu .

International Programs and Services 27Scholarships for Study Abroad Various competitive scholarships are available for international study, including NSEP, Gilman, Freeman-Asia, and Rotary International fellowships. Students interested in scholarships should contact the Office of International Programs at least 18 months before planning to go abroad. In addition to formal study abroad, there are many other opportunities for undergraduate students to enjoy a significant international experience through volunteer programs, work-based experience, internships, and experiential learning. The Office of International Programs maintains information on these opportunities in the International Resource Center in Laurel Hall. International Student and Scholar Services Office in Laurel Hall Mark Hallett, Director International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) provides immigration documentation and advising to international students, scholars, and their families. ISSS support services include pre-arrival information, on-campus orientation and various workshops, cross-cultural adjustment and advising information. ISSS serves as liaison to academic departments, other campus offices, and sponsoring agencies and embassies. Additional services are provided to agency-sponsored students. New and transfer international students are required to report to campus at an earlier date. Due to the importance of orientation, attendance is required for all new and transfer international students .ISSS offers an integrated series of pr ograms and services for international students, scholars, and their families at Colorado State University. These programs address cultural adjustment needs, academic success, immigration requirements, health and wellness topics, and re-entry issues. Another key element is maintenance of connections between international students, scholars, and their families with their home countries and a focus on understanding Americans and American culture. Programs include International Fest, the Day in the Mountains (a unique one-day interactive cross-cultural seminar), and the cross-cultural interactions of international students and U.S. students through the Council of International Student Affairs (COISA) and through community outreach programs sponsored by the Fort Collins International Center.

Specific dates are listed in the on-line class schedule. After this deadline, there is no adjustment in tuition and fees if students drop part of their schedule. University Withdrawal Once classes begin, students dropping all courses and leaving the University must contact the Center for Advising and Student Achievement (CASA), Aylesworth Hall NE, Room 201. Adjustments of tuition and fees will be made on a pro-rated basis according to the following chart: Withdrawal Assessment for Fall and Spring1 Withdraw in Week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10% 15% 20% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% Withdraw in Week 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 60% 65% pro-rated tuition and fees adjustments may be made in the following situations: 1. Withdrawing students who received financial aid are subject to specific federal, state, and University withdrawal policies regarding tuition and fees, housing charges, refunds to financial aid programs, and repayments resulting from their withdrawal. A withdrawal may require an immediate refund of financial aid funds programs. Refunds are calculated according to Student Assistant General Provisions regulations. The date of a student's withdrawal, financial aid disbursements to the student's account, University charges, and payments by the student or a third party are used to calculate the refund amount. If a student withdraws a cash balance from his or her student account to use for living expenses, the student may have to repay those funds which are in excess of an amount determined to be reasonable for their length of enrollment. All calculated refunds and repayments will be allocated to financial aid programs first, and any remaining amount to the student. 2. No financial adjustment will be made for a student who is suspended, dismissed, or expelled for breach of discipline. 3. University room and board charges will be assessed through the vacate date from University housing. 1Summer term has a different assessment schedule and the withdrawal policy is in the Summer Class Schedule. 4.

International Programs and Services 30Special Course Fees Certain courses require enrolled students to pay fees for special services and/or materials. Since the costs are determined annually in June, courses with fees are indicated by ($) in the Courses of Instruction section of this catalog. For the most current listing of special course fees, visit the Provost/Academic Vice President Web page at www.provost.colostate.edu/index.asp?url=ug_studies . For some courses enrolled students are assessed a uniform fee during registration to cover the costs incurred by the University to offer the courses. These costs include the rental of external facilities, the expenses of field placements, the provision of special facilities of a personal nature that the University would not otherwise maintain, and/or the costs of off-campus travel of students with supervising faculty members. For some courses enrolled students are assessed variable fees by the department based upon actual use of expended materials supplied by the department and used by the student in the creation, construction, and/or fabrication of an object of value, such as a class project that becomes the student's property. The assessed amount is based upon actual use of expendable materials supplied by the department because of the inability to make individual purchases economically. For some courses enrolled students are assessed variable fees by the department based upon actual damage or non-return of equipment used in the courses. All special course fees will be assessed and collected through normal student accounts receivable procedures. No fees should be paid directly to academic departments or individuals. Additional Expenses Personal and Living Expenses Students from other countries should anticipate expenses considerably higher than those quoted above. The following estimates do not include costs of deposits for off-campus housing, transportation, international travel, clothing (particularly winter clothing for those coming from warmer climates), living expenses during vacation periods and during the summer months for those who choose to remain on campus, the cost of keeping an automobile and insuring it, babysitting, shipping books and other belongings home, taxes owed on U.S. source income, and items of personal use which cannot be brought in a suitcase and which must be purchased in the United States after arrival. An annual inflation rate of 3-5% should be anticipated in all calculations. These figures, therefore, are subject to change. For an up-to-date list of estimated expenses, please see http:www.international.colostate.edu .The minimum amount of financial support necessary per academic year (nine months) for a single, undergraduate student is based on current tuition and fee amounts for 2003-2004. The actual total may exceed this minimum, as it reflects a relatively modest standard of living. In addition, expenses for graduate students run considerably higher than for undergraduate students because of research costs, thesis expenses, field trips, special equipment, and more expensive textbooks. Students enrolled in specialized training courses in non-degree schools should refer to the specific program document for costs. Students accompanied by dependents must allow additional funds, please see the Family Estimate of Expenses below. Undergraduate Student Estimate of Expenses for One Academic Year (9 months) Non-resident tuition (fall and spring) $ 13,380 For full time enrollment per INS regulations Required Student Fees (fall and spring) $ 906 (Fees for first semester on campus will be $951) Mandatory health/accident insurance coverage $ 965 (12-month coverage) Books and supplies $ 800 Housing, food, miscellaneous personal $ 8,100 Total estimate $ 24,151 The minimum amount of financial support necessary per calendar year (twelve months) for a single graduate student is based on current tuition and fee amounts for 2003-2004.

Expenses for graduate students are higher than for undergraduate students because of research costs, thesis expenses, field trips, special equipment, and more expensive textbooks. The actual total may exceed this minimum, as it reflects a relatively modest standard of living.

These protections are presented in the form of university policies, applicable federal and state laws, and statements of fundamental rights and responsibilities which govern both the academic setting and the university community as a whole. Some of the policies and expectations in this chapter are relevant to students, faculty and staff; others are focused specifically on the student population. Colorado State University expects students to maintain standards of personal integrity that are in harmony with the educational goals of the institution; to observe national, state, and local laws, and University regulations; and to respect the rights, privileges, and property of other people. Principles of academic honesty, respect for diversity, and pursuit of lifestyles free of alcohol and drug abuse are examples of these standards. Students are not only members of the academic community; they are, additionally, members of the larger society and thus retain the rights, protection guarantees, and responsibilities which are held by all citizens. GUIDING PRINCIPLES Commitment to Diversity As a comprehensive research land grant university, Colorado State University has a fundamental responsibility to offer equal educational opportunities to all individuals with the courage, desire, and dedication to pursue an education and fulfill their aspirations and dreams in a democratic and pluralistic society. The University strives to educate Colorado's and the nation's future leaders who represent a diversity of perspectives and ethnic and cultural experiences. Freedom of Expression and Inquiry The faculty of Colorado State University considers freedom of discussion, inquiry, and expression to be in keeping with the history and traditions of our country and to be a cornerstone of education in a democracy. Colorado State University is committed to valuing and respecting diversity, including respect for diverse political viewpoints. If any members of our campus community (students, faculty, or staff) feel that they have been treated differently because of their political perspectives, they should contact the Office of Dispute Resolution in Lory Student Center, Room 200. It is the policy of Colorado State University to encourage students to engage in discussion, to exchange ideas and opinions, and to speak, write, and publish freely, in accordance with the guarantees and limitations of our state and national constitutions. Scholars have not only a right, but also a responsibility, to examine critically the insights, understanding, values, issues, and concerns which have evolved in the various areas of human activity. Consequently, it is the policy that University-registered student organizations may invite guest lecturers, exhibitors, performers, and works of art to be performed or exhibited with no restrictions of form or content other than those imposed by law. It is understood that inviting a speaker, performer, or exhibit does not imply concurrence of the University or of the sponsoring organization with the opinions, beliefs, or values expressed. It is expected that in exercising their rights, individuals and groups will be cognizant of their obligation to other individuals and groups, to the academic community, and to the larger community of the city, the state, and the nation. Freedom from Personal Abuse The University acknowledges the right of all people to freedom from personal abuse. Abusive treatment of individuals on a personal or stereotyped basis prevents the attainment of the University objective to create and maintain an environment which supports, nurtures, and encourages people to excel in teaching, learning, and creativity. Therefore, the University deplores, condemns, and will act energetically to prevent all forms of personal abuse, including sexual harassment. For statements of University policy concerning personal abuse, see the University Guiding Policies section and Student Rights and Responsibilities section within this chapter.

The University complies with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, related Executive Orders 11246 and 11375, Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veteran's Readjustment Act of 1974, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, and all civil rights laws of the state of Colorado. Accordingly, equal opportunity for employment and admission shall be extended to all persons and the University shall promote equal opportunity and treatment through a positive and continuing affirmative action program. In order to assist Colorado State University in meeting its affirmative action responsibilities, ethnic minorities, women, and other protected class members are encouraged to apply and to so identify themselves. Admission of students, employment, and availability and access to Colorado State programs and activities are made in accordance with these policies of nondiscrimination. Off-campus householders who desire to list student accommodations with the University must certify that they will comply with the University's policy on nondiscrimination in student housing. Any student or University employee who encounters acts of discrimination because of age, race, religion, color, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, veteran status, or disability either on or off campus is urged to report such incident to the Office of Equal Opportunity of Colorado State University, located in 101 Student Services. Any person who wishes to discuss a possible discriminatory act without filling out a complaint form is welcome to do so. Any of the above discriminatory acts can also be the subject of complaints to the Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, as well as to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Colorado Civil Rights Division; information on filing complaints with any of these agencies is available in the Office of Equal Opportunity. Sexual Harassment Policy Office of Equal Opportunity of Colorado State University Office in 101 Student Services Building Dana Hiatt, Director (970) 491-5836 www.colostate.edu/Depts/OEO/ Colorado State University does not tolerate sexual harassment among students, employees, or other members of its community. Sexual harassment is prohibited in the employment context by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and in the education context by Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972. Sexual harassment occurs when unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature appear in any of the following contexts: (1) submission by an individual is made either an explicit or implicit term or condition of academic standing or of employment; (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for academic or employment decisions affecting the individual; or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with a person's academic performance or work, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive academic or work environment. Generally, a single sexual joke, offensive epithet, or request for a date does not constitute sexual harassment; however, being subjected to such jokes, epithets, or requests repeatedly may constitute hostile environment sexual harassment. In determining whether the alleged sexual harassing conduct warrants corrective action, all relevant circumstances, including the context in which the conduct occurred, will be considered. Facts will be judged on the basis of what is reasonable to persons of ordinary sensitivity and not on the particular sensitivity or reaction of an individual. In cases of alleged sexual harassment, the protections of the First Amendment must be considered if issues of speech or artistic expression are involved. Free speech rights apply in the classroom and in all other education programs and activities of public institutions, and First Amendment rights apply to the speech of students and teachers. Great care must be taken not to inhibit open discussion, academic debate, and expression of personal opinion, particularly in the classroom. Nonetheless, speech or conduct of a sexual or hostile nature that occurs in the context of educational instruction may exceed the protections of academic freedom and constitute prohibited sexual harassment if it meets the definition of sexual harassment and (1) is reasonably regarded as nonprofessional speech, or (2) lacks accepted pedagogical purpose or is not germane to the academic subject matter.

Policies and Guiding Principles 34The University can respond to sexual harassment only if it is aware of its existence. Any member of the University community who believes that she or he has experienced sexual harassment or reprisal shall contact the Office of Equal Opportunity to request advice and information about possible ways to proceed, including use of the University formal complaint procedures. Such discussion will be kept confidential to the full extent permitted by law. Similarly, any member of the University community who believes that she or he observed an incident of sexual harassment in the University learning and working environment or who receives report of alleged sexual harassment from an employee or student should seek assistance from the Office of Equal Opportunity. Full details of the Colorado State Sexual Harassment Policy, including what is involved in bringing a complaint and the procedures for informal and formal resolution are available from the Office of Equal Opportunity or online at the Colorado State Web site on the A-Z list under \"Sexual Harassment Policy\" or directly at www.colostate.edu/ Depts/OEO . STUDENTS' RIGHTS A summary of the University policies dealing with a wide range of student life and activity follows. For more information regarding additional student life policies at Colorado State University, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, 201 Administration Building. As members of the University community, students can reasonably expect the following: 1. Students have the right to freedom from discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, creed, political beliefs, national origin, age, or handicap. 2. The University shall not interfere with the rights of students to join associations. 3. Students should have accurate information relating to maintenance of acceptable academic standing, graduation requirements, program student learning outcomes, and individual course objectives and requirements. 4. Student records will be maintained in keeping with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and subsequent amendments and the guidelines for implementation. 5. In all instances of general discipline, academic discipline, and academic evaluation, the student has the right to fair and impartial treatment. 6. Colorado State University considers freedom of inquiry and discussion essential to a student's educational development. Thus, the University recognizes the right of all students to engage in discussion, to exchange thought and opinion, and to speak, write, or print freely on any subject in accordance with the guarantees of Federal or State constitutions. This broad principle is the cornerstone of education in a democracy. 7. Students have the right to be free from illegal searches and seizures. 8. Students have the right to freely exercise their full rights as citizens. In this light, the University affirms the right of students to exercise their freedoms without fear of University interference for such activity. Student Bill of Rights - Colorado Revised Statute 23-1-125 The Colorado Student Bill of Rights focuses on various aspects of student academic life including advising, transferability of credits, and degree completion. One particular segment of the Student Bill of Rights notes that a student may formalize a plan to obtain a degree in four years. Colorado State University supports this timeline for graduation by publishing advising guidelines under which a student may expect to graduate in four years and also publishes curriculum check sheets defining a common four-year course progression for each major. These check sheets and advising guidelines are available in each department office and in the Center for Advising and Student Achievement (CASA), Aylesworth Hall. There are some majors which a student may not be able to complete in four years because of additional degree requirements recognized by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education. Rights Regarding Students' Educational Records Students have certain rights concerning their \"education records\" under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, as amended, 20 U.S. 1232g et. seq. (FERPA). These include: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's educational records within 45 days of the day the University receives request for access. Students should submit to the Office of Enrollment Services, or in the case of graduate studies, to the Graduate School, written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

Policies and Guiding Principles 35by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. All enrolled and former students may have access to their educational records maintained within the University. Those individuals and agencies having access to a student's records include \"school officials,\" defined below, with legitimate educational interests; parents claiming a student as a dependent on their federal income tax; scholarship and other financial aid organizations supporting the student; organizations conducting studies for, or on behalf of, educational agencies or institutions for the purpose of developing, validating, or administering predictive tests, student aid programs, or to improve instruction; organizations carrying out accrediting functions of programs offered by the University; appropriate person(s) in an emergency; and any party designated by judicial order or subpoena, provided that, except for subpoenas and orders issued for law enforcement purposes, the University first notifies the student of the order or subpoena. Any other individual or organization must have a student's written consent to view or have access to the educational record. A student may receive one copy of each item of information contained in the educational record at a cost of $.25 (charge subject to change) per page. 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes are inaccurate or misleading. Students may ask the University to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to consent to disclosure of personally identifiable information contained in the student's educational records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. An exception exists for public release of \"directory information\" unless the student has placed a written request that such information be withheld in the Office of Records and Registration by the end of the second week of classes. Colorado State defines \"directory information\" as a student's name, current mailing and e-mail address, telephone listing, major field of study, class, dates of attendance, anticipated date/term of graduation and expected award(s), participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, and honors and degrees awarded. Another exception allows disclosure of information about the student to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the University has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the governing board of the University; or a student serving on an official committee, or in a volunteer capacity, such as a peer mentor or member of a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. Such officials have legitimate educational interests when they need to review a student's educational records to fulfill their responsibilities to the University. Furthermore, the University discloses students' educational records without consent, upon request, to officials of other schools in which a student seeks to or intends to enroll. 4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Ave. SW, Washington, DC 20202-4605. Right to Discuss Concerns with Department Heads/Chairs Academic department heads are expected to incorporate student input into decisions affecting academic instruction, advising, and student learning assessment. This input usually takes form through departmental advisory committees and student evaluation of faculty members. Individual students, however, may make appointments with their department heads to discuss specific problems, plans, or suggestions. Right to File a Grade Appeal Instructors are responsible for stating clearly the instructional objectives of the course at the beginning of each term and for evaluating student achievement in a manner consistent with these objectives. Students are responsible for maintaining standards of academic performance established for each course in which they are enrolled. Instructors are responsible for determining and assigning final course grades.

Policies and Guiding Principles 36achievement will be available to the student for inspection and discussion. Students may appeal instructors' grading decisions. The burden of proof, however, rests with the student. See complete detail of the grade appeal process in the About Grades section of the Advising and Registration chapter, Right to Peaceful Assembly The University acknowledges the right of students and others to assemble in groups for peaceful purposes. At such gatherings, the University expects the rights and privileges of all persons to be respected and that there will be no endangerments to health or safety. Such gatherings must in no way disrupt the normal conduct of University affairs or endanger University property. The University may, consistent with the Constitution, establish reasonable regulations regarding the time, place, and manner in which persons exercise their free speech rights to the extent necessary to prevent disruption of the normal conduct of University affairs or endangerment of health and safety of persons or damage to property. Accordingly, persons planning on such assemblies on the University campus must coordinate their activities and plans in advance through the Lory Student Center Event Planning Office. This coordination is requested so as to prevent disruption of normal University educational activities and avoid endangering the health or safety of persons or damage to property. The sponsoring individual or group must assume responsibility for compliance with all state and municipal laws and University policies. Assistance from staff is available to help plan such events, and the assistance of University police may be requested to help with traffic or crowds. Any act by demonstrators or groups which interferes with the rights of others, disrupts the normal functioning of the University, damages property, or endangers health or safety is grounds for suspension or dismissal from the University and/or removal from University property. In addition, such actions may also be the basis for criminal charges by law enforcement authorities. Demonstrations are prohibited in any special-use facility, classrooms, or in any instance which interferes with educational functions. Demonstrators refusing to vacate premises upon request are subject to immediate temporary suspension and arrest under applicable municipal and state laws. Right to Seek Membership in Student Organizations Colorado State officially recognizes a great variety of student organizations. Policies established by the Board of Governors prohibit any recognized student organization from excluding students from membership on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, or handicap. All recognized student organizations must assure the University that their membership policies and procedures are in compliance with this University policy. Local chapters of regional, national, or international organizations must assure the University that membership policies of the parent organization do not require the local chapter to exclude any student from membership on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, or handicap. Victims' Rights The University is committed to providing appropriate support and referrals to persons who have been the victims of crimes or violations of University policy. Persons who have been victimized by a Colorado State University student may choose to report the incident to the Colorado State University Police or Conflict Resolution and Student Conflict Services to initiate criminal and/or disciplinary action. Victims also have the opportunity to receive personal support from appropriate University resources. RESOURCES Students who have questions, concerns or need assistance with application of rights listed above may contact the pertinent resource including: Office of Dispute Resolution, Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, Office of Equal Opportunity, Provost's Office or academic department office. If you are unclear as to which office to approach, contact the Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct Services Office to begin with. STUDENTS' RESPONSIBILITIES Colorado State University has twice been ranked among the nation's Top Character Building Institutions ( http://welcome. colostate.edu/index.asp?url=features.templeton ) by the Templeton Foundation. Through curricula r and co-curricular programs, students at Colorado State University develop knowledge and skills to engage as respectful citizens in a diverse society, recognize the implications of their many choices, and become ethically responsible individuals.

Policies and Guiding Principles 37Academic Integrity The foundation of a university is truth and knowledge, each of which relies in a fundamental manner upon academic integrity and is diminished significantly by academic dishonesty. Academic integrity is conceptualized as doing and taking credit for one's own work. A pervasive attitude promoting academic integrity enhances the sense of community and adds value to the educational process. All within the University are responsible for and affected by the cooperative commitment to academic integrity. Academic dishonesty (see examples below) undermines the educational experience at Colorado State University, lowers morale by engendering a skeptical attitude about the quality of education, and negatively affects the relationship between students and instructors. Instructors are expected to use reasonably practical means of preventing and detecting academic dishonesty. Any student found responsible for having engaged in academic dishonesty will be subject to academic penalty and/or University disciplinary action. Students are encouraged to share responsibility for the academic integrity of the University by reporting incidents of academic dishonesty. Examples of academic dishonesty include (but are not limited to): 1.Cheating in the Classroom - Cheating includes using unauthorized sources of information and providing or receiving unauthorized assistance on any form of academic work. Examples include copying the work of another student on an exam, problem set, or quiz; taking an exam or completing homework for another student; possessing unauthorized notes, study sheets, answer codes, programmed calculators, or other materials during an exam; and falsifying exams or other graded paper results. 2.Plagiarism - Plagiarism includes the copying of language, structure, ideas, or thoughts of another, and representing them as one's own without proper acknowledgment. Examples include a submission of purchased research papers as one's own work; paraphrasing and/or quoting material without properly documenting the source. 3.Unauthorized Possession or Disposition of Academic Materials - Unauthorized possession or disposition of academic materials includes the unauthorized selling or purchasing of examinations or other academic work; stealing another student's work; unauthorized entry to or use of material in a computer file; theft or mutilation of library materials; and using information from or possessing exams that an instructor did not authorize for release to students. 4.Falsification - Falsification encompasses any untruth, either verbal or written, in one's academic work. Examples include receiving unauthorized assistance or working as a group on a take-home exam, independent exam, or other academic wor k without authorization, or lying to avoid taking an exam or turning in other academic work. Furthermore, falsification of any University document is a violation of academic integrity. Examples include student identification numbers, transcripts, grade sheets, credentials, University status, or letters of recommendation. Forging a signature is another specific example of falsification. 5.Facilitation of Cases of Academic Dishonesty - Facilitation of any act of academic dishonesty including cheating, plagiarism, and/or falsification of documents also constitutions violation of Colorado State University's academic integrity. Examples include knowingly discussing specifics of the content of a test or examination you have taken with another student who has not yet taken that test or examination or facilitating, by sharing one's own work, a student's efforts to cheat on an exam or other academic work. If an instructor has evidence that a student has engaged in an act of academic dishonesty, the instructor will notify the student of the concern and make an appointment to discuss the allegations with the student. The student will be given the opportunity to give his/her position on the matter. If the student admits to engaging in academic dishonesty or if the instructor judges that the preponderance of evidence supports the allegation of academic dishonesty, the instructor may then assign an academic penalty. Examples of academic penalties include receiving a reduced grade for the work, a failing grade in the course, or other lesser penalty as the instructor deems appropriate. If, after making reasonable efforts, the instructor is unable to contact the student or collect all relevant evidence before final course grades are assigned, he/she shall assign an interim grade of incomplete and notify the student of the reason such grade was given. If the student disputes the allegation of academic dishonesty he/she should request a hearing with Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct Services. The University Hearing Officer will determine whether or not a preponderance of evidence exists in support of the allegation of academic dishonesty. If the University Hearing Offi cer finds insufficient evidence or clears the student of the charges, the instructor will determine a grade based upon academic performance and without reflection of the academic dishonesty charge and change any previously assigned grade accordingly.

Policies and Guiding Principles 38University Hearing Officer finds the student culpable, the Hearing Officer may impose additional University disciplinary sanctions. Instructors should report to Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct Services all cases of academic dishonesty in which a penalty is imposed. Instructors may recommend that a hearing be conducted to determine whether additional University disciplinary action should be taken. Information about incidents of academic dishonesty is kept on file in Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct Services. No further action is initiated unless the incident constitutes a major infraction, the student has a prior record of University infractions, or there are subsequent reports of misconduct. Information regarding student rights, administrative hearing procedures, classifications and definitions of University disciplinary action, University Discipline Co mmittee, appeal procedures, and the maintaining of disciplinary records is contained in the \"Student Rights and Responsibilities\" document available through the Vice President for Student Affairs' Office. Classroom Behavior The classroom instructor is responsible for all classroom conduct, behavior, and discipline. University policy permits only enrolled students, persons authorized by the instructor, and administrative personnel to be admitted to instructional areas during scheduled periods. University policy and Colorado state law also prohibit all forms of disruptive or obstructive behavior in academic areas during periods of scheduled use, or any actions which would disrupt scheduled academic activity. Use of classrooms and other areas of academic buildings during nonscheduled periods is permitted only in accordance with departmental, college, or University practices. Any person or persons in unauthorized attendance or causing a disturbance during scheduled academic activity shall be identified by the instructor and asked to leave. Persons refusing such a request may be removed by the University police and are liable to legal prosecution and/or disciplinary action. Conduct Code Students also have an obligation to know and follow the regulations of the University. Violations will form the basis for University intervention or disciplinary action. The following actions are prohibited. 1. Academic dishonesty such as cheating, plagiarism, or knowingly furnishing false information to the University. (Specific procedures for cases of academic dishonesty are reviewed above under Academic Integrity in this section of the catalog, the Graduate and Professional Bulletin, or the Honor Code of the Professional Veterinary School as applicable.) 2. Forgery, alteration, misuse, or mutilation of University documents, records, identification, educational materials, University property, or unauthorized use of the University computer system, computer access codes, and University long distance calling identity codes. 3. Obstruction or disruption of teaching, research, administration, disciplinary procedures, and other University activities. Rioting, aiding, abetting, encouraging, participating in, inciting a riot, or any act of misconduct as defined is specifically forbidden on University premises. 4. Abusive conduct which threatens or endangers the physical or psychological health, safety, or welfare of an individual or group of individuals; harassment of any member of the University community including harassment on the basis of race, sexual orientation, age, gender, religion, physical disability. 5. Intentional unauthorized interference with the right of access to University facilities, or freedom of movement or speech of any person on campus. 6. Failure to comply with the verbal or written directions of University officials acting in the performance of their duties and in the scope of their employment, or resisting police officers while acting in the performance of their duties. 7. Theft of, or damage to, use of, or possession of other persons' or University property in a manner inconsistent with its designated purpose; unauthorized entry, use, or occupation of University facilities, property or vehicles. 8. Use or possession on University property of firearms or simulated weapons; ammunition or other dangerous weapons, substances, or materials; bombs, explosives, or incendiary devices prohibited by law.

Academic advising can be facilitated by a professional staff person or a faculty member. All students are entitled to a quality advising system. The following factors are characteristic of such a system: xAccessibility to students; xAn adequate amount of time spent in advising students; xFamiliarity with the requirements of various University programs; xAbility to relate successfully to a wide variety of students; xKnowledge of resources available for the meeting of students' needs; xMaintaining adequate records. Adviser Role and Responsibilities The academic adviser's responsibilities (whether faculty or staff) include the following: xHelp students define and develop realistic educational and career goals. xAssist students in planning a program consistent with their abilities and interests. xAssist students in monitoring and evaluating their educational progress. xDiscuss relationships between instruction program and career. Assist students in identifying career opportunities. This includes utilizing the Career Center. xInform students of the nature of the adviser/student advisee relationship. xInterpret and provide rationale for instructional policies, procedures, and requirements. xMonitor all designated educational transactions, i.e., course selection, changes of major, graduation requirements, etc. xMaintain an advising record for each student. xDesignate and post hours available for advising.Advisee Role and Responsibilities Students carry a portion of responsibility in the advising process. In the interest of successfully completing a degree program, a student must be proactive in finding the necessary resources needed for attaining a degree. In order to contribute to an effective advising relationship, students are expected to: xSchedule and attend advising sessions each semester prior to course registration. Advising sessions may be conducted via email or telephone, depending on the adviser or the advisee. xClarify personal values, abilities, interests, and goals. xBecome knowledgeable of all graduation requirements and adhere to institutional policies, procedures, and deadlines. xPrepare for each advising session. xFollow through on actions identified during each advising session. xResponsibly evaluate his/her adviser in order to strengthen the quality of advisement. xBecome familiar with the Career Center and other campus resources. Academic Adviser Contact The first step is knowing where to find your academic adviser. If you have declared a major, go to the academic department office of your major. If you are an Intra-University, Life Science, or Biomedical Sciences Open Option student, contact the Center for Advising and Student Achievement (CASA), northeast wing of Aylesworth Hall. If you are a college open option student, you can contact the appropriate college office. In addition to your assigned adviser, you may work with another adviser if you are interested in a professional program such as medicine, law, or veterinary medicine, or education. You will also have more than one adviser if you are completing a double major, minor, interdisciplinary studies program, or study abroad. The Center for Advising and Student Achievement has initial contact information. You need to go see your adviser within the first month of arriving on campus, again for registration preparation, and anytime that you have a question or problem.

Advising and Registration 41to see your academic adviser for assistance with course selection, major information or exploration, career planning, graduation requirements, and campus resource information. Advising Resources In order for you to get the best from your academic advising experience, you are encouraged to utilize the many advising tools that are available. For instance you need to have a major check sheet which outlines all the graduation requirements for your major ( www.core.colostate.edu). The GUIDE (Guide to University and Individual Degree Evaluation) is a degree audit that shows you what graduation requirements you have completed and what requirements you still need to complete. Newly admitted transfer students receive a GUIDE after the evaluation of transfer coursework. Juniors and seniors (as well as freshmen and sophomores in selected departments) may obtain a GUIDE from the academic department each term after grades are posted. A GUIDE may also be requested at any time from the Degree and Transfer Evaluation staff in the Registrar's Office. The General Catalog, All-University Core Curriculum listing outlines the general education requirements for graduation ( www.core.colostate.edu ). Academic and Career Horizons information sheets describe the interests, skills, and career opportunities for each major. Additionally, the exploratory course list suggests introductory courses and the key adviser list provides a faculty contact for all majors in the University. All this information is available at http://welcome.colostate.edu/index.asp?url=advres . Along with tools for academic exploration, various resources are available for the career exploration and planning process. Information about working with a career counselor, learning about career resources, gathering information about internships, and preparing to get a job can be found on www.careercenter.colostate.edu . Tools to assist you in your academic success at Colorado State include the GPA calculation on RAMweb, tutoring information, and campus resources such as the Learning Assistance Center and the Writing Center (welcome.colostate.edu/index.asp?url=advres ). About Credits Full-Time/Half-Time Enrollment Status Enrollment status (full-time, half-time) is determined by the number of credits which the student has completed or is pursuing for the term in which the certification is requested. Courses from which the student has withdrawn or is auditing are not included. (The following schedule for enrollment status differs from the full-time/part-time schedule for tuition and fees. See Registrar's Web site: www.registrar.colostate.edu . Credit requirements are as Full-time 12 or more credits Half-time 6-11 credits Graduate Students Full-time 9 or more credits Half-time 5-8 credits Summer Session: Undergraduates Full-time 6 or more credits Half-time 3-5 credits Graduate Students Full-time 5 or more credits Half-time 3-4 credits Undergraduate Classification Student level (class) is determined by the number of credits earned (passed) at Colorado State and credits accepted in transfer. Transfer credits may or may not be acceptable in meeting degree requirements. Student Level Semester Credits Freshman 0-29 Sophomore 30-59 Junior 60-89 Senior 90 and over Credit Hour and Credit Load A credit hour is defined as 50 minutes of lecture or discussion/recitation per week for 16 weeks (800 minutes in a semester), 100 minutes of laboratory per week for 16 weeks (1600 minutes in a semester) when outside preparation is required, or 150 minutes of laboratory per week for 16 weeks (2400 minutes in a semester) when no outside preparation is required. For workload planning purposes (and to graduate with 120 credits in 8 semesters), students should plan on an average of 15 credits per semester and should expect that each credit hour will require approximately three hours (for some students in some classes, more time and in a few classes less time) of effort per week to attend classes and to accomplish readings and out-of-class assignments in preparation for successful completion of the course requirements.

Advising and Registration 42Credit Overload Undergraduate students who wish to register for more than 18 credits per term must have an overload approved by their adviser and department head, by using an overload form at http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Registrar/Credit%20Over load.pdf . Graduate students should consult the Graduate and Professional Bulletin. Approval of an overload for graduate students must be obtained from the department head or graduate dean. Earning Alternative Credits College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) See additional detail in Admissions Policies and Procedures chapter in this catalog. Credit awarded for these examinations cannot be used in meeting the Colorado State residency requirement for the baccalaureate degree. General Examinations The General Examinations measure college-level achievement in five basic areas of the liberal arts: English composition, humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, and social science-history. Credit granted on the basis of the General Examinations will be treated as general elective transfer credit without a grade but will count toward graduation. Credit granted cannot be used to meet the University written communication or mathematics requirements. Subject Examinations See the website, www.registrar.colostate.edu , use the link \"Transfer Office,\" for a list of the Subject Examinations for which Colorado State credit will be granted and the fees. Credit for Study Abroad Students are encouraged to participate in accredited study abroad programs. Credit is granted for courses taken in programs approved in advance by the University, subject to certain conditions. To apply for credit, a student must process a \"Study Abroad Transfer Credit Form\" available in the Study Abroad Office, Laurel Hall. Challenging Colorado State Courses for Credit The opportunity to challenge the content of a course on the basis of an examination may be permitted. This option is at the discretion of the individual department and may exclude courses where a laboratory or practicum is an integral part of the course being challenged. A fee of $20 (subject to change) per credit attempted is assessed and is not refundable. Upon successful completion of an exam, a grade of S (satisfactory) is recorded on the student's academic record. No record of unsuccessful attempts is recorded. A course may not be challenged under the following conditions: 1. To satisfy the residence requirement for graduation. 2. When the person seeking credit is not currently registered at Colorado State University at the time the examination is administered. 3. When a student has previously failed a placement or challenge exam for the course. Students wishing to establish credit by challenge may obtain the application form from the University Testing Service, C81 Clark Building. International Baccalaureate Credit Students who graduate from high school with an International Baccalaureate or have completed International Baccalaureate examinations may receive University credit for scores of four or higher. The website, www.registrar.colostate.edu and the \"Transfer Office\" link, lists the courses for which credit will be granted.

Students wishing to transfer from one major to another can obtain information about any restrictions that may be in place, as well as the actual process involved, from either the department office or from the Center for Advising and Student Achievement. A change of major form is available from the Office of Records and Registration in 100 Administration Annex. All changes of major forms are processed through this office. Adding or Dropping A Curricular Program Students wishing to add or drop a second major or minor use a change of major form available from the Office of Records and Registration in 100 Administration Annex. After the student receives the appropriate approvals, the Records Office will process the change. A student seeking an interdisciplinary studies program needs to contact the department overseeing the interdisciplinary study program. Refer to the University-Wide Instructional Programs chapter for more detailed information. Registration/Schedule Changes Class Schedule Class schedule information is available on-line to students prior to the beginning of the registration period and provides registration procedures and courses to be offered during a given term. Students may access electronic class schedules through: ramweb.colostate.edu/RW2000-0.cfm or through www.colostate.edu/Depts/Registrar . Enrollment must conform to the courses listed in the on-line class schedule. Registration Process Registration, including schedule changes (adds and drops), is accomplished on-line by selecting the Registration link in RAMweb. To access RAMweb, use the following Web address: ramweb.colostate.edu. Deadlines for registration changes can be found on line at following address: www.colostate. edu/Depts/Regi strar/registrationchanges.htm In order to fully benefit from the system, it is essential that students follow the required procedures and conform to the established deadlines as presented in the applicable on-line class schedule. Being prepared to register (by having a list of course section ID numbers written down) will minimize mistakes and time on the system, thereby reducing the demand during peak registration periods. It is essential that students maintain a current mailing address with the University by updating it at www.ramweb.colostate.edu. Deadlines for registrations and payments of tuition, fees, and other charges must be met to allow registration to occur. Therefore, students must respond to correspondence from the University in a timely manner. The University also requires that each enrolled student provide an email address. Students may use either the email of their choice or the free email service the University provides through Holly/Lamar/Simla and some colleges. Course Overrides Even when a course has reached the formal enrollment limit, the instructor, on occasion, may give special permission for a student to register in the course. Students receive a copy of the override form from the department that offers the course. After obtaining the signature of the instructor or their designee, the student submits the form to the Records and Registration Office, 100 Administration Annex, for processing. Late Registration A late registration charge of $50 (subject to change) is assessed for adding the first course on or after the first day of classes or for late adds after the registration period. Registration Cancellation Prior to the beginning of the semester, all courses can be canceled via the web registration system with no charge.

Advising and Registration 44Registration Changes in Full- or Part-Time Status Tuition and fees will be adjusted for students that go above or below the 9 credit assessment cut-off during the schedule change period at the beginning of the semester. The specific dates are listed in the appropriate on-line class schedule. After this deadline, there is no adjustment in tuition and fees if students drop part of their schedules. Repeating a Course Students may register for and complete a course more than once but it can only be used one time to fulfill graduation requirements. The original grade and grades earned in repeated courses are used in calculating grade point averages, unless a student exercises the Repeat/Delete policy explained in the section below. Schedule Change and Drop Periods Periods for changing schedules (adds, drops, changes of sections, grading options, or credits) are listed in the University Calendar at the front of this catalog and in the applicable on-line class schedule. Courses dropped during this period are not reflected on the student's academic record, and tuition and fees may be adjusted as a result. Consult the appropriate on-line class schedule for course drop deadlines. The course withdrawal period begins after the schedule change period and closes at the end of the eighth week of the term. A \"W \" (withdrawal) will be recorded on the academic record except in the case of the 60-credit English composition and mathematics requirements (see the All-University Core Curriculum section of this catalog). No drops may be made after the schedule change period. See also Class Attendance Regulations in this section of the catalog. Tuition and fees will not be adjusted for drops during this period. See also Tuition a nd Fees Adjustments in the Financial Services for Students chapter of the catalog. Courses taught in terms of less than 16 weeks are subject to proportionately shorter drop periods. Students withdrawing from the University may not use the drop procedure to drop their last class, but must contact the Center for Advising and Student Achievement (CASA), Aylesworth Hall NE, 201. See also Withdrawal in this section.Registration Alternatives Independent Study Independent study is a type of learning that supplements regular, supervised classroom instruction by permitting the student to carry such learning even further, working independently under necessary and sufficient guidance of a supervising instructor. While details of each independent study project are negotiated by the student and instructor, the expectation is that at least three hours per week of directed effort on the student's part is required for each credit. Personal contact (face-to-face, telephone, Internet, or other forms of communication) is expected. The instructor and the student shall specify in writing the requirements the student should fulfill to complete the course, including due date, contact expectations, number of credits, and other pertinent information. The instructor, student, and department head shall sign this statement and retain a copy. Upon completion of the project, a copy or description of the work involved shall be retained in the department for at least seven years. GUEST Program Granting a University Enrollment for a Specific Term (GUEST) is a registration option for individuals who want to take University classes without applying for formal admission to a degree program. GUEST students are cleared to take classes one term at a time providing the prerequisites have been met and there is space available in the class.

Advising and Registration 46About Grades Traditional Grading - Plus/Minus Term grades are reported using the scale below. Faculty use of +/- grading is optional. Course instructor(s) should indicate on the course syllabus and/or policy statement the grading system used in the course. Grade points Grade per credit A+ 4.000 A (Excellent) 4.000 A- (Poor, but passing) 1.000 D- 0.667 I (Incomplete) * F (Failure) 0.000 W (Withdrawal) * S (Satisfactory) ** H (Honors) ** U (Unsatisfactory) * AU (Audit) * NG (No Grade Reported) * * Credits not used to compute grade point average (GPA) and not counted toward graduation. ** Credits not used to compute GPA but counted toward graduation. Credits for courses graded F and WF are used to compute GPA, but they do not count toward graduation. (WF grades were not issued after Summer Session 1979.) When an X is placed before a grade, e.g., XA, XB, etc., the student has been granted an academic fresh start. These grades are not calculated into the grade point average. When a # symbol is placed before the grade, the student has elected to repeat the course under the terms of the University's Repeat/Delete policy. The original course grade is not calculated into the grade point average. Students may contest whether or not an assigned grade was recorded accurately in the educational record by following the procedures described under the Grade Appeal section below.Student Option Pass/Fail Students may elect pass/fail grading in one course per term in courses offered for student option pass/fail grading under the following conditions: Undergraduate students, except first-term freshmen and transfers, with a cumulative Colorado State grade point average of 2.00 or better and with the adviser's consent, may register for approved courses on a student option pass/fail basis. This work may not be in areas of study required in the student's major, minor, teacher licensure, or for All-University Core Curriculum requirements (i.e., it must consist of free electives not specified as to general area of study. A 20-credit social science requirement, for example, would not be considered free electives.) Changes to pass/fail grading can only be made at the beginning of the semester. Performance equivalent to a grade of D+/D/D- or better is recorded as S (pass). Performance equivalent to F is recorded as U (fail). Neither the S or U grades are used in calculating the Colorado State grade point average; however, courses graded S may apply to graduation requirements. Changes to or from pass/fail grading by students must be made during the schedule change period. A grade for a course taken as pass/fail may not be converted to a traditional grade for purposes of improving the GPA to meet graduation or scholastic requirements. In situations where students change their major or minor to include required courses taken previously for pass/fail grades, the major department will determine if such courses may be considered as fulfilling degree requirements. When it is determined that an ineligible student is or has been registered for a pass/fail course, a traditional grade will be assigned. A correct pass/fail registration including adviser approval is the express responsibility of each student. Pass/fail registration policies for graduate students are described in the Graduate and Professional Bulletin . Auditing a Class A student wanting to attend a class without earning credits may register as an auditor. Auditing a course requires prior approval of the instructor of the course. If an instructor determines that an auditor's attendance or participation is unsatisfactory, the course will not be recorded on the student's academic record. Changes to or from audit status must be made during the registration or schedule change period. Tuition and fees are assessed for audited credits. Audits do not count for full-time status for loan deferments, financial aid, etc. Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

Advising and Registration 47Incompletes At the discretion of the instructor, a temporary grade of \"I\" may be given to a student who demonstrates that he/she could not complete the requirements of a course due to circumstances beyond the student's control and not reasonably foreseeable. A student must be passing a course at the time that an incomplete is requested unless the instructor determines that there are extenuating circumstances to assign an incomplete to a student who is not passing the course. When an instructor assigns an \"I\", he/she shall specify in writing the requirements the student shall fulfill to complete the course as well as the reasons for granting an \"I\" when the student is not passing the course. The instructor shall retain a copy of this statement in his/her grade records and provide copies to the student and the department head or his/her designee. The student should not register for the course the following semester (to complete the coursework). After successful completion of the makeup requirements, incomplete grades will be changed by the instructor of record or the department head, in absence of the instructor of record. After one year, an incomplete will be automatically changed to an \"F\" (failure) unless the course has been previously completed and a grade change submitted by the instructor or the department head. The temporary grade of \"I\" must be changed to a grade (e.g., A, B, C, D, F, S, U) prior to the student being awarded his/her diploma from Colorado State University. Discontinuing a Class (Student Non-Attendance) If a student discontinues attending a class and has not officially dropped through the Office of Records and Registration, the grade of F (failure) is recorded. Repeat/Delete Policy Repeat/Delete is a one-time per course grading option that may be used by undergraduate students who repeat a course. The following rules apply when the Repeat/Delete option is applied: 1. The grade received in the repeated course will be used in calculating the student's GPA, regardless of whether the repeated grade is higher, the same as, or lower than the initial grade received. The initial grade will remain on the transcript, but will not be used in calculating the GPA when the Repeat/Delete option is applied. Use of the repeat/delete policy may change a student's cumulative grade point average, but will not result in a notation of probation on the student's transcript. 2. It is the student's responsibility to request the Repeat/Delete option from the Registrar, before the expiration of the course withdrawal period in the semester in which the course is first repeated. 3. The Repeat/Delete option may be used for a maximum of ten (10) credit hours and no more than three courses. 4. If the course is repeated at any time subsequent to the use of the Repeat/Delete option, all grades in that course, except the initial grade, are used in computing the student's GPA. 5. Although a course may be repeated as often as a student chooses, the Repeat/Delete option can be used only the first time a course is repeated. 6. Use of the repeat/delete option may change a student's cumulative grade point average, but will not change a notation of probation on the student's transcript. Grade Appeals Instructors are responsible for stating clearly the instructional objectives of the course at the beginning of each term and for evaluating student achievement in a manner consistent with these objectives. Students are responsible for maintaining standards of academic performance established for each course in which they are enrolled. Instructors are responsible for determining and assigning final course grades. Graded examinations, papers, and other materials used as a basis for evaluating a student's achievement will be available to the student for inspection and discussion. Students may appeal instructors' grading decisions. The burden of proof, however, rests with the student to demonstrate that the grading decision was made on the basis of any of the following conditions: 1. A grading decision was made on some basis other than performance and other than as a penalty for academic dishonesty. 2. A grading decision was based on standards unreasonably different from those which were applied to other students. 3. A grading decision was based on a substantial, unreasonable, or unannounced departure from previously articulated standards. Before making an appeal, the student should discuss the situation with the instructor(s) involved in the decision. To appeal a grading decision, the student shall submit a written request to the department chairperson. The request must set forth the basis for the appeal, identifying one of the three categories set forth above. The request must be submitted or postmarked, if mailed, no later than 30 calendar days after the first day of classes of the next regular semester following the date the grade was recorded. If no appeal is filed within this time period, the grade shall be considered final. Within 30 days of receipt of the request for an appeal, the student's appeal shall be provided to the instructor(s) who assigned the grade and an appeals committee formed in accordance with the departmental policies.

Advising and Registration 48instructor(s) who assigned the grade or other faculty may not be available, then the appeals committee will be formed no later than 30 days from the beginning of the following fall semester. This committee shall be composed of two faculty members and two students from within the department and one outside faculty member who shall serve as a voting chair. The appeals committee will review the written appeal and response of the instructor(s). They may elect to separately interview both the student and the instructor(s) before rendering a decision. The decision of the appeals committee will be based upon whether one of the conditions for an appeal set forth above has been met. At the conclusion of the deliberations, the committee shall render one of the following decisions: 1) the original grading decision is upheld, or 2) the department chair or his/her designee(s) will reevaluate the student's achievement of the instructional objectives of the course and assign a grade accordingly. Written notice of the committee's decision and the reasons for the decision normally will be sent to the student and the instructor(s) within 30 calendar days of the appointment of the committee. The appeals committee's decision is the final decision of the University. Written summaries of the hearing and decision, together with a rationale for that decision, shall be provided to the student and the instructor who assigned the grade and shall be retained in the department office for a period of one year. Semester Grades Students may access their semester grades through RAMweb four business days after the end of each term. Transcripts Transcripts of students' official academic records are maintained by and may be requested from the Office of Records and Registration. Unofficial copies of a student's transcript may be obtained by the student through RAMweb. Enrollment or Degree Verification For verification of enrollment status, term(s) of attendance, or degree awarded, go to www.ramweb.colostate.edu. For other verifications contact the Office of Records and Registration in 100 Administration Annex. About Withdrawals Withdrawal from a Course The course withdrawal period begins after the schedule change period and closes at the end of the eighth week of the term. A \"W\" (withdrawal) will be recorded on the academic record, except in the case of the 60-credit English composition and mathematics requirements (see the All-University Core Curriculum chapter of this catalog). See Schedule Change and Drop Periods under Registration/Schedule Changes in this chapter. Withdrawal from Colorado State University withdrawal (to drop all courses and leave the University) is different from dropping one or more courses. If the first day of the semester has not yet begun, students may cancel their course schedule through RAMweb without any charge. Once classes have started, students who are planning to drop all courses and leave the University for any reason during the term must contact the Center for Advising and Student Achievement (CASA), 201 Aylesworth Hall NE, prior to their departure to complete the withdrawal process. Unless this procedure is followed, students are not eligible for an adjustment (if appropriate) of tuition and fees and will receive failing grades in all courses. Called to Active Military Duty Any student reservist called to active military duty may, upon presentation of a copy of her/his orders to the Center for Advising and Student Achievement (CASA), be given a grade of incomplete in courses for which she/he is registered. The student or her/his designee may make this request in person, by letter, or by telephone; however, the request will not be processed until a copy of the orders is received. Advisers will counsel with the student or her/his designee and the student's instructors to select the option (either withdrawal from the University, cancellation of courses, or receiving an incomplete-\"I\") that is most appropriate to that student's situation. If the student wishes to withdraw from the university because he/she has been called to active duty, the student will receive a full tuition refund for the semester. The grade of incomplete shall remain on the student's record for a period not to exceed one year following the end of the semester in which the student reenrolls at Colorado State. By this date, the grade will be changed by the instructor or the department head of record, or it will revert to a grade of F.

Advising and Registration 49assist students with any academic issues related to their active duty. Retroactive Withdrawal Under certain circumstances a student may request that all grades in an academic period (one or more semesters of continuous enrollment) be retroactively removed and be replaced by entries of W on his/her transcript. A retroactive withdrawal may be granted only when a student has experienced extenuating circumstances or an incident of such trauma and major proportions that he/she could not have been reasonably expected to possess normal capabilities necessary to complete the academic period satisfactorily or complete a university withdrawal during the semester. An undergraduate or graduate student desiring to have a semester (or more) of courses retroactively dropped from his or her transcript must submit a written request, with supporting documentation, to the Committee on Scholastic Standards and Awards through the Center for Advising and Student Achievement (CASA) in 201 Aylesworth Hall NE. CASA advisers are available to assist students with this process. If the Committee on Scholastic Standards and Awards grants the appeal, all courses for the semester(s) will be removed from the student's transcript. No tuition refund will be given. If the committee denies the retroactive withdrawal request, the student is allowed one additional request for that period. If the appeal is denied, the student's academic record, for the semester(s) in question, will remain on the student's transcript. Class Attendance and Final Exams Class Attendance Regulations At the discretion of the instructor in charge, any full-time student, faculty member, or senior citizen may attend any class without formal registration provided adequate classroom space is available. Students should attend all classes for which they are registered to obtain maximum educational benefits. Absence or lateness does not excuse students from required course work. Instructors and departments are responsible for establishing class attendance policies. These policies must accommodate student participation in University-sanctioned extracurricular/co-curricular activities. Students must inform their instructors prior to the anticipated absence and take the initiative to make up missed work in a timely fashion. Instructors must make reasonable efforts to enable students to make up work which must be accomplished under the instructor's supervision (e.g., examinations, laboratories). In the event of a conflict in regard to this policy, individuals may appeal using established University procedures. Academic departments may replace any students in a course who fail to attend both of the first two regularly scheduled meetings of the class (one meeting for laboratory courses or for classes which meet once each week), unless the students have notified the department or the Office of Records and Registration in advance. Since this procedure is a department option, students remain responsible for dropping courses they do not intend to complete and within the required time period for drops. Final Examinations Final examinations, when appropriate, are given during the final week of each semester. During this week, classes are rescheduled to meet for two-hour periods. The following procedures apply to all courses during the final week of the semester: 1. Final examination week is part of the regular semester. Student attendance shall be consistent with University policy. 2. The final in-class examination period is intended for the end-of-semester examination. No in-class examination constituting more than 10% of the final course grade may be given in undergraduate courses during the week preceding the final examination period of the semester; laboratory, performance, and other alternative classes (e.g., courses in the individualized mathematics program) excluded. It is the responsibility of the department head, or, where appropriate, the school head, to ensure compliance with this policy. 3. Courses for less than four credits shall meet for one period. Courses for four or more credits may meet for two periods. 4. Classes that begin at times other than on the hour (i.e., 9:30, 2:10, 3:35, etc.) will use the time period assigned for the hour (i.e., 9:00, 2:00, 3:00, etc). For example, a 4:30 TR class would use the 4:00 TR assigned final examination period. 5. Classes shall meet only at the times indicated on the final examination schedule. 6.

If a student has three or more final examinations (not classes) scheduled for the same day or if conflicts of examination times occur, the student may negotiate a time change with the instructors involved. If the parties involved cannot find a mutually agreeable time, the Registrar's office indicates which courses must be changed. Note: The Assistant Registrar, Classroom Scheduling, must be notified at least one week prior to final examination week to allow instructors time to make appropriate changes. 8. Any student who has a conflict with the examination schedule must inform the instructor as soon as possible before the examination. If an agreement cannot be reached between the instructor and student as to the appropriateness of a make-up examination, the student should appeal to the department head.

Procedures relative to scholastic standards are administered through the Center for Advising and Student Achievement (CASA). Those students whose scholastic achievement is less than that required for graduation are placed on probation or dismissed from the University Policies regarding probation, dismissal, and appeal are determined by the faculty and the University in their absolute discretion subject to acceptance by the governing board of Colorado State. MINIMUM CUMULATIVE GRADE POINT AVERAGE In order to graduate, a minimum cumulative grade point average (CUM GPA) of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale must be earned at Colorado State University. The CUM GPA is based on grades of A, B, C, D, and F. A student is expected to maintain a CUM GPA of 2.0 or higher at all times. Grades earned in regular credit courses through the Division of Continuing Education or the Colorado State summer session will count toward the CUM GPA regardless of when those classes are taken. Failure to maintain a CUM GPA of 2.0 or higher will result in one of the following actions. ACADEMIC PROBATION Failure to maintain a CUM GPA earned at Colorado State University of 2.0 or higher will result in academic probation for a period of two regular semesters (fall and spring). Grades earned in regular credit courses through the Division of Continuing Education or the Colorado State summer session will count toward the CUM GPA regardless of when those classes are taken. At any time that the CUM GPA is raised to a 2.0 or higher, the student will return to regular academic standing. Students who withdraw from Colorado State while on probation will remain on probation if they return to the University. Students on academic probation who return to Colorado State after attending another institution will continue their probation, since transfer credits are not computed within the CUM GPA earned at Colorado State. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL Students on academic probation who do not raise their CUM GPA to a 2.0 or higher after two regular semesters (fall and spring) will be dismissed from Colorado State University. Students who have been academically dismissed from Colorado State University have two options to seek readmission. First, they can take classes through the Colorado State University summer session or through the Division of Continuing Education, but they are not eligible to apply for readmission until the CUM GPA is raised to 2.0 or higher. The second option available to students who have been academically dismissed is to enroll at another accredited institution and meet the requirements to be admitted as a transfer student to Colorado State University. Upon transferring back to Colorado State University, students will have two semesters following re-enrollment to raise their CUM GPA earned at Colorado State University to 2.0 or higher or face academic dismissal again. Transfer credits are not computed within the CUM GPA earned at Colorado State University. Students who have raised the CUM GPA to 2.0 or higher or who apply as students transferring from another institution may apply for readmission to the University subject to any enrollment limitation as set by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education or the governing board. Appeal of Academic Dismissal Students have the privilege to appeal academic dismissal. A written appeal may be submitted the Center for Advising and Student Achievement for consideration by the Scholastic Standards and Awards Committee. All appeals must be submitted in accordance with written instructions. All appeals of academic dismissal will be acted upon by the Scholastic Standards and Awards Committee no later than seven business days prior to the first day of classes for the next regular academic semester (either fall or spring).

Scholastic Standards 52ACADEMIC FRESH START Undergraduate students may apply for an academic fresh start, a policy which allows students to establish a new academic record. A student may be granted a fresh start only once. An academic fresh start may be granted only after five years have elapsed since the student's last term of enrollment as a regular student, regardless of the number of credits taken. The time period during which courses were taken through the Division of Continuing Education or the Colorado State summer session after leaving the University will not count as part of the five-year interval. Applications for a fresh start will be made through the Office of Admissions and should be submitted one semester prior to the academic term in which a student wishes to enroll in the University. Receipt of a fresh start does not guarantee admission, but may aid the student in normal admissions procedures. A student granted a fresh start and enrolled will have a demarcation on the permanent academic record to delineate the previous record from the new academic record achieved under the fresh start policy. Credits for those courses in which a grade of at least C- or S was awarded prior to the fresh start may be applied toward graduation requirements under the fresh start policy. Only grades earned after the fresh start demarcation will be computed in the new GPA. Colorado State University reserves the right at any time, without notice, to change, modify, or cancel any course, program, procedure, policy, financial requirement, or disciplinary arrangement set forth in this catalog whenever, in its sole discretio n, it determines such action to be appropriate.

OUTREACH UNITS OF THE UNIVERSITY Agricultural Experiment Station Office in Administration Building, Room 15 Lee E. Sommers, Director (970) 491-5371 www.colostate.edu/Depts/AES Agricultural research has been part of Colorado State University since the institution's beginning. In 1888, the Colorado General Assembly established the Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station (AES) as a contributor to the federally-created state agricultural experiment station system. That system now encompasses all fifty states and a number of United States territories. The AES is an integral part of Colorado State and conducts research on agricultural and natural resource problems. These research programs are conducted by academic departments in Fort Collins and by off-campus research centers located throughout Colorado. The AES is not a single location, but is an integrated, statewide research system. The mission of the AES is to focus and support research leading to an agriculture that is economically viable, environmentally sustainable , and socially acceptable. Areas of disciplinary and interdisciplinary research emphasis for the AES include: a) environmental quality - the interaction of agricultural and natural resource systems; b) improvement of plant and animal resources; c) integrated agricultural systems; d) alternative uses for agricultural commodities; e) foods, their quality and safety; and f) enhancing agricultural and rural economies. Agricultural research programs include the traditional areas of producing and processing food products such as wheat, beef, fruits, and vegetables and also areas such as human nutrition, textiles, floriculture, ornamental plants, rangelands, water quality, and wildlife. The food production system involves use of human and monetary capital to manage natural resources. The AES supports research projects conducted by faculty in the Colleges of Agricultural Sciences, Applied Human Sciences, Engineering, Liberal Arts, Natural Resources, and Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. In addition to on-campus research programs, the Agricultural Experiment Station conducts applied research at 8 off-campus research centers: Agricultural Research Development, and Education Center (ARDEC), Fort Collins; Arkansas Valley, Rocky Ford; Eastern Colorado, Akron; Plainsman, Walsh; San Juan Basin, Hesperus; San Luis Valley, Center; Southwest Colorado, Yellow Jacket; and Western Colorado at Fruita, at Orchard Mesa, and at Rogers Mesa. A number of farmers and ranchers cooperate with the Agricultural Experiment Station in various studies, and some research is conducted cooperatively with other state and federal agencies, especially the Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture. The AES disseminates research results through technical bulletins and reports, journal articles, and other types of publications.

Colorado State University supports this timeline for graduation by publishing advising guidelines under which a student may expect to graduate in four years and also publishes curriculum check sheets defining a common four-year course progression for each major. These check sheets and advising guidelines are available in each department office and in the Center for Advising and Student Achievement (CASA), Aylesworth Hall. There are some majors which a student may not be able to complete in four years because of additional degree requirements recognized by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS The following apply to all students entering Colorado State University who enroll Summer Session 2000 or thereafter. Students are required to complete all curricular requirements in place in the current catalog at the time of graduation. (See Changes in Undergraduate Curriculum Requirements in this chapter.) The list is a sufficient guide for academic planning, but does not represent all rules which might apply to a particular student or program of study. GRADUATION CREDIT REQUIREMENTS To meet requirements for the bachelor's degree, a student must fulfill: Minimum Credit Requirement A bachelor's degree requires a minimum of 120 semester credits; however, individual programs in colleges and departments may exceed the minimum. Minimum Grade Requirement Only credits completed with grades of A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, and S may count toward the graduation total. Some majors require a minimum grade of C or C- in required courses. For further information, contact the department offering the major. Graduation Average Requirement The minimum cumulative grade point average acceptable for graduation is 2.00 computed only for courses attempted at Colorado State. Total credits earned and counted toward graduation may differ from total credits used in computing a scholastic average, since the scholastic average is computed by dividing the total grade points earned at Colorado State by the total credits attempted including credits for grades of A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, and F. Credits graded S may count toward graduation. Upper-Division Credit Requirement A minimum of 42 semester credits in upper-division courses (300-400 level) is required of all students completing a bachelor's degree program. Although 500-level courses cannot be required in undergraduate programs of study, elective credits taken at the 500 level may be used to fulfill the upper-division requirement.

While CollegeSource\u00ae, Inc. and Career Guidance Foundation provides information as a service to the public, copyright is retained on all digital catalogs. Graduation Requirements and Procedures 69\"In residence\" Requirement A minimum of 30 upper-division semester credits must be completed in residence at Colorado State University. \"In residence\" courses include any authorized Colorado State University course recorded as Colorado State credit on the Colorado State transcript. As an approved exception, \"in residence\" may also be satisfied by pre-approved upper-division credits earned in authorized study abroad programs and designated domestic exchange programs, if simultaneously enrolled in designated CSU courses. Pre-approval procedures are required. Senior Year Requirement Of the last 30 semester credits earned immediately preceding graduation, no more than 15 may be completed at other colleges or universities. CHANGES IN UNDERGRADUATE CURRICULUM REQUIREMENTS Students who entered the University as first-year students (freshmen) in Summer Session 2000 or thereafter must complete the All-University Core Curriculum (AUCC) requirements. Until Summer Session 2002, students with continued enrollment from Spring Semester 2000 and newly admitted transfer or read mitted students were admitted under the University Studies Program (USP) and must complete those requirements unless they made an adviser-assisted decision to switch their program of study to the AUCC. Details about the University Studies Program and its programs of study are available in the Colorado State University General Catalog, 1999-2000 . Students are held for curricular requirements (including AUCC requirements) as set forth in the current catalog at the time of graduation, except 1) if so doing will extend the time normally required to complete the degree; or 2) if so doing will force students classified as juniors or seniors to take additional lower-division courses, exclusive of AUCC requirements. A request for waivers or substitutions for major curriculum requirements must be approved by the adviser and department head. Ultimate responsibility for ensuring that curriculum requirements are observed and that substitution of equivalent courses or waivers are for good and sufficient academic reasons rests with the Provost/Academic Vice President. UNDERGRADUATES TAKING GRADUATE-LEVEL COURSES Undergraduates may enroll for a maximum of nine credits of course work which may be applied toward a graduate degree at Colorado State provided that such course work: 1) is not used to meet bachelor's degree requirements; and 2) has been approved by the chairperson of the department in which a graduate degree will be sought. Undergraduate students may not enroll in courses numbered 600-699 to satisfy undergraduate degree requirements. Undergraduate students may not enroll in courses numbered 700-799. EXCLUSION OF COURSES FROM THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE Undergraduates who enroll in 500-level courses which are not applied toward the bachelor's degree may request that an exclusion statement be placed on their academic records. This makes such courses potentially applicable to a Colorado State graduate degree. Students cannot exclude any courses below the 500 level under this policy. (See Course Restrictions in this section.) Courses at the 600 level are automatically excluded from use for an undergraduate degree. A written request must be filed in the Degree and Transfer Evaluation Office, Room 100, Administration Annex, no later than the end of the term in which the excluded course is taken. Exclusion of these courses from the bachelor's degree does not assure acceptance of this credit toward a graduate degree program. These excluded courses are computed in the undergraduate grade point average. TIME LIMITATION ON CREDIT Courses completed within the preceding ten years may apply toward a bachelor's degree. After ten years, course work is reviewed by the department head and college dean to determine its appropriateness to the major requirements. GRADUATION PROCEDURES AND INFORMATION Checking University graduation requirements is the responsibility of the Degree and Transfer Evaluation Office. Curriculum requirements are checked by the department head of the first major and the second major and/or minor if applicable. Requests for waivers of or substitutions for curriculum requirements must be approved by the adviser and department head (see Changes to Undergraduate Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

Graduation Requirements and Procedures 70Curriculum Requirements in this chapter). Requests for waivers or substitutions of the All-University Core Curriculum must be submitted on a form found at www.core.colostate.edu and sent to Degree and Transfer Evaluation, 100 Administration Annex, 8021 Campus Delivery, and signed by the adviser and department head. Intent to Graduate No later than the third week of the term prior to the graduating term, students must declare an intent-to-graduate indicating their first major, and second major and/or minor if applicable, with the Degree and Transfer Evaluation Office. Students will subsequently receive a GUIDE (Gateway to University and Individual Degree Evaluation) concerning fulfillment of the University graduation requirements. Contract for Graduation Candidates for degrees must complete and sign a contract for graduation for majors, second majors, and minors in the first week of their graduation term in the department office(s) of their majors/minors. Students not completing degree requirements that term must file another contract for graduation during the first week of the new graduation term. Good Standing Status A student must be in good standing to receive a Colorado State degree. Accordingly, any student who is subject to suspension or probation for scholastic or disciplinary reasons will not graduate until the conditions of suspension or probation have been satisfied. Graduation List The official graduation list is prepared each term by the Degree and Transfer Evaluation Office from the contracts for graduation. Students may not graduate unless their names appear on the list as approved by the Faculty Council during the graduation term. Off-Campus Completion of Degree Requirements Seniors who are registered for final course work at another institution, either in residency or by correspondence or extension, must have their contracts for graduation on file in the Degree and Transfer Evaluation Office by the end of the third week of the graduation term. Official transcripts showing completion of work from another institution must be on file in this office by the last day of the graduation term. COMMENCEMENT (GRADUATION CEREMONIES) Commencement is held each year at the end of each fall and spring semester. Students completing degree requirements during any term receive their diplomas by mail within 6 weeks following the close of the graduation term. Candidates must appear in appropriate academic attire at commencement exercises. GRADUATION WITH DISTINCTION Colorado State recognizes outstanding scholarship by granting the baccalaureate degree \"Cum Laude,\" \"Magna Cum Laude,\" and \"Summa Cum Laude\" to those students in each college who have achieved unusually high academic excellence in their undergraduate programs. To be eligible for graduation with distinction, students must meet the following requirements: Minimum grade point average required for graduation with distinction. To qualify for graduation with distinction, a minimum of 60 credits completed at Colorado State University is required. Students who have been granted Fresh Start must have completed 60 credits after the Fresh Start designation to qualify for graduation with distinction. Transfer credits are not considered when determining a) candidacy for graduation with distinction or b) graduation with distinction. Summa Magna College Cum Laude Cum Laude Cum Laude 3.99 3.91 3.74 Human Sciences 3.97 3.89 3.74 Business 3.96 3.85 3.72 Engineering 3.95 3.86 Arts 3.96 3.97 3.92 3.77 Biomedical Sciences These minimum cumulative grade point averages will be reviewed every four years and may be changed if needed to maintain appropriate academic standards. Each of the minimum grade point average needed to graduate with distinction will be adjusted at the end of each four year period only if the percentage of students graduating with distinction in a distinction category and college have shown a statistically verifiable deviation from the target percentages of: Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

Graduation Requirements and Procedures 71 Summa Cum Laude 1% Magna Cum Laude graduation w ith distinc tion are recognized at the time of commencement. A student's candidacy is determined by their cumulative grade point average through the semester preceding graduation. \"Candidacy\" for graduation with distinction does not guarantee graduation with distinction. Graduation with distinction is based on the student's cumulative grade point average at the time of graduation. Students seeking a second bachelor's degree are eligible for distinction designation. To qualify for graduation with distinction, a minimum of 60 credits completed at Colorado State is required after the first degree. In determining the grade point average of the student, only grades earned after the first degree are considered. GRADUATION AS A UNIVERSITY HONORS SCHOLAR Students who complete the University Honors Program Core Curriculum, and achieve at least a cumulative 3.5 grade point average earn the designation of University Honors Scholar. Scholars are recognized at graduation by the Honors Program and during the colleges' commencement ceremonies. The Honors Scholar designation appears on diplomas and transcripts. For information about admission to the University Honors Program, visit or contact the Honors Program Office, E 203 Newsom Hall, Fort Collins, CO 80523-1025; (970) 491-5679 or visit on-line at www.honors.colostate.edu .

University Open Option is for students with a rich and diverse set of interests that span the University curriculum. Life Science Open Option is designed for students who are interested in the life sciences, but have not chosen a specific major. Additionally, students who want to explore a particular college but are not sure which major in the college they want to study, can start in College Open Option. Through the Open Option programs students are able to learn about various academic opportunities while keeping their options open as they begin their college experience. Professional academic advisers in the Center for Advising and Student Achievement (CASA) are knowledgeable about academic requirements to assist students in the process of selecting a major. Advisers help students plan their schedules, provide information on career options, and refer students to other resources. Students should declare a major by the time they earn 30 credits. Human Health Professions Advising Colorado State University does not offer specific pre-med or \"pre-health\" majors because health professional programs neither prefer nor recommend particular undergraduate majors. Students interested in a career in the health professions may select a major from among the many choices offered by the University. After declaring a major, a student is assigned an academic adviser from the department to ensure that they fulfill the requirements for that major. Undergraduates who intend to pursue careers in the health professions should take the prer equisites for acceptance into one of the professional post-baccalaureate programs. Professional advisers assist students in planning for entrance into accredited programs of dentistry and dental hygiene, medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, optometry, pharmacy, physical therapy, physician assistant, podiatry, chiropractic, and other human health professions. Advisers assist students in determining which courses to take, help them gain the experiences needed to make them attractive candidates, and aid them in preparing their applications to professional programs. Pre-Veterinary Medicine Advising Pre-veterinary advising provides guidance for students in any major who are interested in pursuing a career in veterinary medicine. Placement into professional veterinary medical programs is extremely competitive and a successful applicant needs to be well informed regarding course requirements and other factors considered by veterinary admissions committees. The pre-veterinary adviser works with students in all majors who are planning for careers in the animal health professions. The adviser also provides support for the biomedical sciences open option students. After a major has been chosen, students work with their academic adviser to ensure that they fulfill graduation requirements and with a pre-vet adviser to be sure that their courses also satisfy admission requirements for professional veterinary programs. UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES Undergraduate Majors Major Requirements The student wishing to graduate must complete the requirements for a major and the All-University Core Curriculum (see that section of the catalog). A major is a sequence of courses in a subject-matter area or discipline which, when accompanied by appropriate supporting courses, leads to a degree. A minimum of 27 semester credits constitutes a major. Completion of a major is shown on both the student's diploma and academic record. Second Major Requirements Students may elect to complete concurrently the requirements for two majors. Combinations are available in unrelated as well as related majors. At least one full term before the graduation term, students selecting second majors must contact the Office of Records and Registration in Enrollment Services to make official declarations and gain departmental approval for the joint curricular plans. Common requirements for either major may count in meeting curriculum requirements for both majors.

Degree Programs 73Students must file an intent-to-graduate and a contract for graduation in the Degree and Transfer Evaluation Office for both majors. The single degree awarded is that degree appropriate for the first major. A single diploma issued which displays both majors, and both are recorded on the student's academic record. Students must complete degree requirements for the first major before they can graduate. Students completing degree requirements for the second major only cannot graduate until the first major's degree requirements have been met. Concentration Requirements Some majors have concentrations (or specialization areas). A concentration is a sequence of at least 12 semester credits of designated courses within a major designed to accommodate specific interests of students. Completion of a concentration is shown on a student's academic record. Option Some majors have options which are a sequence of courses within a major or concentration of either guided electives or electives selected from areas of interest as approved by the student's adviser. Options do not appear on diplomas or transcripts.

Transfer of equivalent credits from another college. Students who transfer with less than three semester credits in composition will be required to take the Composition Placement Examination before enrolling in COCC 150. Credit for COCC 150 will not be given for high scores on the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP). A student (except a first semester transfer or a first semester readmitted student) who has earned 60 or more Colorado State and transfer semester credits and who has not met this requirement must enroll in a course that will fulfill this requirement in order to have a hold lifted from his/her registration. If a student drops or withdraws from the course or does not earn a passing grade, the grade of record will become an \"F\" which will be calculated into both the semester GPA and the cumulative GPA as a consequence for not completing the 60-credit completion requirement as defined by this policy. A transfer or readmitted student will be allowed the initial term of enrollment before this restriction is imposed. Appeals Process A student wishing to appeal this registration restriction must write a detailed rationale as to why he or she was unable to complete the course within the first 60 credits. This appeal must be received by the student's academic adviser and department head. If both the adviser and the department head approve the appeal, it is then sent to the dean's office of the student's primary major for approval or disapproval. If the dean supports the approval it must be presented through the Records Office, 100 Administration Annex, to the Director of the Composition program (or designee) for final approval or disapproval. Placement Procedures All students, including freshmen and transfer students who have not satisfied the University composition requirement in one of the three ways explained above, must take the Composition Placement Examination. All students taking this exam will be assessed a fee of $15, which will be billed to their student account. The examination is offered at PREVIEW Colorado State, at the beginning of each semester, and during preregistration each semester (contact the Department of English, (970) 491-6428, for time and place). Students should take this examination as soon as possible after admission and may take the test only once . On the basis of this examination students are placed as follows: 1. If placement scores indicate a lack of basic writing skills, students can prepare for COCC 150 through either a tutorial program in the Writing Center (Eddy 6) or placement into CO 130\u2014a course designed to provide an intensive writing experience. Students completing the Writing Center Tutorial will then enroll in CO 130. The Writing Center tutorial program is only available during the academic year, not during the summer session. The Writing Center tutorial does not require registration and does not carry University credit, but students must sign up for a tutor during the first or second week of the semester. For tutorial assignment, students should contact the Writing Center (Eddy 6). 2. If placement scores indicate adequate preparation in basic writing skills, the student is placed in COCC 150, College Composition. 3. If placement scores indicate superior writing skills, the student is placed in COCC 150-Section 550, College Composition-By Exam. Students receiving credit through COCC 150-Section 550 will be automatically enrolled in COCC 150-Section 550 and will receive three semester credits of COCC 150. Students can check their placement by logging onto My RAMweb. On the Homepage, select the second option under More Links -- English Placement Results. MATHEMATICS REQUIREMENT To satisfy the requirements of category 1B of the All-University Core Curriculum (AUCC), students must earn three credits in mathematics. These credits may be earned by 1. Scoring well on the Colorado State University Mathematics Placement Exam (MPE); 2. presenting AP calculus scores from high school of 3, 4, or 5 on either AB or BC exam; 3. taking mathematics courses at Colorado State; or 4. presenting suitable transfer credits from another accredited institution. The MPE covers pre-college algebra and college algebra, logarithmic and exponential functions, and trigonometry. All entering freshmen are required to take the MPE, unless they can satisfy point 2) or 4) above. All other students must also take the MPE and obtain a satisfactory score before taking any mathematics course, unless they can satisfy either points 2) or 4) above. A student who displays proficiency on the MPE may place out of one or more of the precalculus mini-courses - M CC 117, M CC 118, M CC 124, M CC 125, and M CC 126 without earning credit. Placement out of a mini-course on the SPE will satisfy University prerequisites. A student who demonstrates a higher level of proficiency may earn credit in one or more of those courses. Only earned credits count toward the three-credit University mathematics requirement. A student (except a first semester transfer or a first semester readmitted student) who have earned 60 or more Colorado State and transfer semester credits and who has not completed the requirements of category 1B of the All-University Core Curriculum must enroll in a course that will Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

This catalog section summarizes: Environmental Studies Programs Life Sciences Programs Interdisciplinary Studies Programs Reserve Officers' Training Program University Honors Program ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES Supported by colleges and departments throughout Colorado State University (see listing below) The broad spectrum of environmental studies at Colorado State is uniquely dispersed in 100 majors and concentrations housed in departments throughout the University. As a land- grant institution, a key component of Colorado State's mission is to provide education in environmental management, science, and policy. It is difficult to find a degree or department that does not directly address environmental issues at local, national, and international scales. Campus-wide participation in environmental science and management is a result of fundamental linkages between basic science and management of critical environmental issues. Consequently, a unique strength of Colorado State University is a tradition of interdisciplinary research, teaching, and service, which is essential in understanding the environmental problems of today's world. Programs engaged in environmental studies at Colorado State University have goals that include: xUnderstanding that scientific knowledge, policy considerations, and ethical issues are necessarily joined; xComprehending the interrelationships among the environment, natural resources, and human society. xPerceiving the need to integrate diverse social, political, legal, institutional, and biophysical considerations inherent in attaining environmental goals; xEducating students to be articulate, sensitive, and knowledgeable about the complexity of environmental issues facing society; xProviding a balanced understanding of the natural and social processes as they relate to the environment. Some examples of the many areas in environmental studies at Colorado State University are: air pollution assessment and management; air quality, biological control and pest management; climate change, and global warming; biodiversity and conservation biology; ecology and ecosystem management; ecotourism; ecotoxicology; environmental engineering; environmental ethics; environmental history and policy analysis; land and soil management; land ethics and stewardship; natural resources and environmental management; occupational health and workplace management/control; park and protected areas management; pesticide management; pollution control; reproductive and environmental risk factors; risk assessment and management; solid and hazardous waste management; sustainable building design and construction; and water chemistry, quality, and management. The programs at Colorado State University that engage in environmental studies are incorporated within existing majors in the following colleges (departments): College of Agricultural Sciences (Agricultural and Resource Economics, Bioagricultural Sciences and Pest Management, Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Soil and Crop Sciences); College of Applied Human Sciences (Construction Management); College of Engineering (Atmospheric Science, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering); College of Liberal Arts (Anthropology, English, History, Philosophy, Political Science, Sociology); College of Natural Resources (Fishery and Wildlife Biology; Forest, Rangeland, and Watershed Stewardship, Geosciences, Natural Resource Recreation and Tourism, Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory); College of Natural Sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Psychology); College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences (Biomedical Sciences; Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences; Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology). In addition, Colorado State University offers an Environmental Affairs Interdisciplinary Studies Program (see the program description later in this section of the catalog) and an Environmental Studies Open Option for students who first wish to explore options with environmental studies campus-wide before selecting a major (contact the College of Natural Resources for more information on the open option). For further information about specific environmental studies-focused majors, please contact the respective college/department and see their program descriptions within this catalog.

University-Wide Instructional Programs 86LIFE SCIENCES Center for Advising and Student Achievement Offices in Aylesworth Hall, Northeast Wing With more than 350 life science faculty members in 7 colleges and 25 departments, Colorado State University is committed to undergraduate academic programs and research in the basic and applied life sciences. Students can choose from among 34 life science-related majors, 48 different concentrations, and 6 interdisciplinary studies programs. Open Option Advising Program The Life Science Open Option category is a special designation for students who are interested in the life sciences but have not yet chosen a specific major. Professional advisers are knowledgeable about academic requirements in each of the life science disciplines and help guide students through the process of selecting the major most appropriate for their interests and goals. Advisers help students plan their schedules, provide information on career options, internships, and scholarships, and refer them to other resources. The advisers are located in the northeast wing of Aylesworth Hall. Human Health Professions Advising Colorado State University does not offer specific premed or \"pre-health\" majors because health professions programs neither prefer nor recommend particular undergraduate majors. Students interested in a career in the health professions may select a major from among the many choices offered by the University. After declaring an academic major, a student is assigned an academic adviser from that department to ensure that they fulfill the requirements for that major. Undergraduates who intend to pursue careers in the health professions will want to be sure the courses they take also satisfy the prerequisites for acceptance into one of the professional and post-baccalaureate programs. Professional advisers assist students in planning for entrance into accredited programs of dentistry and dental hygiene, medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, optometry, pharmacy, physical therapy, physician assistant, podiatry, chiropractic, and other human health professions. Advisers assist students in determining which courses to take, help them gain the experiences needed to make them attractive candidates, and assist them in preparing their applications to professional programs. Pre-Veterinary Medicine Advising Pre-veterinary advising provides guidance for students in any major who are interested in pursuing a career in veterinary medicine. Placement into professional veterinary medical programs is extremely competitive and a successful applicant needs to be well informed regarding course requirements and other factors considered by veterinary admissions committees. The pre-veterinary adviser works with students in all majors who are planning for careers in the animal health professions. The adviser also provides academic advising for the biomedical sciences open option students while they explore programs and majors offered at Colorado State. After an academic major has been chosen, students work with their academic adviser to ensure that they fulfill the graduation requirements in their major and with a pre-vet adviser to be sure that their courses also satisfy admission requirements for professional veterinary programs. Student Clubs Offices for several student clubs related to the life sciences are located in the northeast wing of Aylesworth Hall. Staff members serve as advisers for the PreMedica, Pre-Vet, Pre-Dental, Pre-Occupational Therapy, Pre-Physical Therapy, Pre-Pharmacy, and Pre-Optometry clubs and provide assistance and support for club activities. The Microbiology and Environmental Health club offices are also housed in Aylesworth Hall. UNIVERSITY INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES PROGRAMS An interdisciplinary studies program is a series of courses focused upon a particular problem or area of concern providing a variety of disciplinary perspectives. Although completion of courses in an interdisciplinary studies program does not lead to a degree, credits earned in these courses can be used in meeting the requirements for a degree. An interdisciplinary studies program includes a core of required courses, with some selectivity, and also a wide choice from supporting courses. Interdisciplinary studies are designated in the catalog to assist the student in identifying logically-related course work in a broad subject matter area. Completion of the requirements for an interdisciplinary studies program is noted on the student's academic record (transcript) but not on the diploma. The minimum number of credits in an undergraduate interdisciplinary studies program is 20. No minimum number of credits is specified at the graduate level.

University-Wide Instructional Programs 90Community Youth Development Graduate Interdisciplinary Studies Program Office in Gibbons Building, Room 201 College of Applied Human Sciences Through a multi-university collaboration, GP-IDEA (Great Plains\u2014Interactive Distance Education Alliance), students can pursue a youth development on-line master's degree or interdisciplinary studies program leading to a certificate. This program provides youth workers and youth development specialists in public and private agencies and programs with a strengths-based, positive youth development curriculum. It emphasizes multiple knowledge bases and the complex concerns for children, youth, and families with the intent to support youth socially, emotionally, and cognitively. In addition to Colorado State University, faculty from four other land-grant universities - Kansas State, Michigan State, Montana State, and the University of Nebraska - share their knowledge and expertise in youth development. Students have the option to pursue a master's degree or one of two certificates: Youth Program Development Specialist or Youth Program Management and Evaluation. Colorado State University offers the certificate programs. Students apply for the program through one of the five universities (which becomes the home institution). There is a critical need for trained youth development professionals. An estimated 17,000 organizations currently serve more than 30 million young people. With a move away from focusing on problems and behavior correction, professionals who understand the strengths-based positive model will be in great demand and competent to work cross-culturally to improve outcomes for youth and youth programs.

Ethnic Studies Interdisciplinary Studies Program Office in Clark Building, C127 Coordinated by a Faculty Advisory Board and the Director of the Center for Applied Studies in American Ethnicity (970) 491-2418 www.colostate.edu/Depts/CASAE/Index The Center for Applied Studies in American Ethnicity offers undergraduate and graduate curricula leading to a certificate in ethnic studies. The certificate will be in accordance with the philosophy that studying and understanding ethnicity in America can deepen appreciation of the various ethnic heritages of America, the patterns of interaction among those ethnic traditions, and the nature of problems suffered because of abuses and misunderstandings about ethnic and perceived racial identities. The ethnic studies program is dedicated to meeting the educational and research needs of students and faculty interested in issues such as inclusive histories, identity formation, cultural practices and beliefs, and historical representations of racial and ethnic groups. The program is designed to provide an instructional and resource base for future professionals working in fields where an understanding of ethnicity in America will enhance their professional effectiveness. Students may pursue, in conjunction with their major, an interdisciplinary program of study in ethnic studies. Students will gain a broad understanding of the historical and contemporary experiences of four major racialized groups in the United States: Asian American, African American, Native American, and Chicana(o)/Latina(o). Certificate students are required to take three foundational courses: Ethnicity in America (ETCC 100), Race Formation in the United States (ET 304), and Ethnic Studies Research Methods and Writing (ET 493). In addition, students must take one elective course from each of the four major groups. A letter grade of \"C\" or better is required in all 21 credits of ET courses. Program details are available from the office of the Center for Applied Studies in American Ethnicity. Students should consult with the Center prior to beginning the program and throughout their course work experience. All CASAE students are required to have a letter grade of C (2.0) or better in all ET courses.

Graduate Program The graduate interdisciplinary research and education program is a cooperative effort offered by faculty in six departments: Animal Sciences; Clinical Sciences; Food Science and Human Nutrition; Horticulture and Landscape Architecture; Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology; and Soil and Crop Sciences. The international reputation of the faculty members and their ability to attract strong extramural support for research in the areas of food science and food safety resulted in the creation of this interdisciplinary program. Faculty research interests are focused in food microbiology, food safety education, food processing, and integrated production/processing. Students interested in the safety and further processing of foods and commodities are encouraged to apply. Students can apply and be admitted into one of the participating departments a nd take part in program activities. Student interactions with faculty from more than one department are strongly encouraged. Graduate programs are customized to fit a student's interests and long-term objectives. Basic training in the food science comes from an integrated first-year curriculum featuring core courses in food science, microbiology, nutrition, and commodity production. Opportunities exist for students to rotate through various laboratories. Students also participate in a weekly interdisciplinary group study that includes papers given by students, post docs, participating faculty, and distinguished visiting scientists, along with visits to member laboratories. The group study course is designed to enhance interaction and facilitate research opportunities among the food science/safety community, including students, faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and staff and may be offered by the participating departments on a rotational basis. The students receives a degree from their home department and a transcript endorsement indicating the student has successfully completed the requirements of the interdisciplinary studies program, which will become part of the student's official record.

Geospatial Science Graduate Interdisciplinary Studies Program Department of Forest, Rangeland, and Watershed Stewardship and the Graduate School Colorado State University offers a graduate-level certificate in geospatial science. The certificate is designed to meet the education needs of two groups of people: 1) those who want to redirect their career with new skills in geospatial science, but who are not interested in pursuing a full graduate degree program at the present time, and 2) those who want a geospatial science focus as part of a traditional graduate degree program in some other discipline. To meet the requirements for the certificate, graduate students take one or more courses in each of four groups or subject matter areas, rather than a defined set of specific courses. These groups and course requirements include: two courses in GIS, two in remote sensing, one in GPS, and two courses in an \"other\" category. Upon completion of the minimum number of credits in each of the four categories and with an average GPA of 3.0 in the courses taken, the student is eligible to receive the certificate. A total of 15 to 21 credits is usually needed to meet these requirements. The certificate program involves faculty from various departments throughout the University serving as advisers for the students, but it is officially housed in the Graduate School and administered through the Department of Forest, Rangeland, and Watershed Stewardship. It is important to note that students applying for the certificate must meet all of the normal graduate admission requirements of the academic department to which they are applying.

The course requirements for this program complement extant life science degree programs on campus. The certificate in the Molecular Biology Interdisciplinary Studies Program will provide recognition that the student has completed a body of course work that provides both breadth and depth in this area. This program provides students with a strong, well-balanced background in the biological, physical, and mathematical sciences. It is ideally suited for undergraduate who wish to pursue advanced degrees in biochemistry, microbiology, molecular biology, or related life sciences; for pre-professional students in health-related fields; and for students interested in employment in the biotechnology industry. The program includes study of macromolecular structure and function; cellular biochemistry; metabolism; gene expression, structure, replication, and repair; cell organization, communication, growth, aging, and death. Courses in physics, organic chemistry, statistical measurements, and research methods are required.

Water Resources Interdisciplinary Studies Program Office in Engineering Building, Room E102 Coordinated by the Colorado Water Resources Research Institute Issues surrounding water supply, water quality, and ecological water relationships have become increasingly important in Colorado as population growth continues and water uses multiply. The complexity of these issues, and competition among various water users, demands that students interested in pursuing careers in water gain a broad introduction to the issues while specializing within a particular discipline. Colorado State University has developed considerable water resource expertise in many academic fields over the past century. The Water Resources Interdisciplinary Studies Program, which requires 21 credits, allows undergraduates to take advantage of this expertise and broaden their backgrounds regarding water resources in order to prepare for employment or graduate-level work.

University-Wide Instructional Programs 104Women's Interdisciplinary Studies Programs Office in Student Services Building, Room 112 Coordinated by a Faculty Advisory Board and the Director of the Office of Women's Programs and Studies The Women's Interdisciplinary Studies Program prepares individuals for the needs and opportunities of a changing world. The program builds awareness of the range of human experience, potential, and accomplishment. Women's Studies uniquely fills Colorado State University's central mission and contributes to interpersonal, intercultural, and international understanding. Contemporary career opportunities can be directly enhanced by students who have a Women's Studies background. In several areas such as journalism, communications, business, law, education, and human services, it is now common to choose a career that has a direct focus on women. In areas that have not traditionally focused on women, an awareness of the history and culture of women and an understanding of sexism can enhance a person's ability to cope with any potential obstacles. In addition, students in Women's Studies have the unique opportunity to apply insights from course work to their own lives, helping them to make more informed choices about careers, education, relationships, and community participation. The program's objectives are: to enable students to explore academic disciplines from a feminist perspective; to help develop and appreciation of the historic and contemporary contributions of women of all cultures; to explore the ideological assumptions regarding women implicit in social institutions; to create opportunities for all students to acquire knowledge and skills necessary for physical, social, and emotional well-being. Students can take women's studies courses to satisfy University and disciplinary requirements as electives, and/or part of a women's studies certificate program. Students interested in pursuing undergraduate or graduate certification in the Women's Interdisciplinary Studies Program should contact the Office of Women's Programs and Studies.

A description of the program may be found in the Graduate and Professional Bulletin, and details are available from the program office. DIVISION OF ARMED FORCES SERVICES Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) History An Act of Congress dated July 2, 1862, provided for military science and tactics instruction in federal land-grant colleges. Such instruction has been given at Colorado State University since its establishment. In 1919, the Department of Military Science and Tactics of the institution was included in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps under the provisions of the First National Defense Act, July 3, 1916. The ROTC Vitalization Act of 1964 provides for a two-year ROTC program in addition to the traditional four-year program and authorizes ROTC scholarships. General Information The Army and Air Force four-year programs complement the four college years and include one summer encampment. Students satisfactorily completing Army or Air Force departmental requirements will be commissioned as second lieutenants in the Army or Air Force. Additionally, each service offers a two-year program whereby a student may earn a commission after completing two years of ROTC training during the junior and senior undergraduate years or during two-year graduate degree program. This program is designed for transfer students or students unable to take ROTC training during their freshman and sophomore years. Each student entering the junior year (sophomore year if on scholarship) of ROTC enlists in the Army or Air Force Reserve and signs a contract. This contract includes a military commitment and obligates the student to complete the junior and senior year ROTC courses, and to accept a commission as a second lieutenant. Scholarship students and all junior and senior ROTC cadets receive $250-$400 per month, tax free, depending on the academic year. Some graduates defer active duty until the attainment of graduate degrees. Opportunities also exist for graduate study while on active duty. Many active duty officers are selected each year for enrollment at civilian universities in graduate degree programs. Such study is accomplished with full pay and allowances for an officer. Purpose The purpose of the Army and Air Force ROTC courses is to develop leadership capabilities, to provide expertise in organized activities, and to qualify students for duty as officers with the Armed Forces of the United States. The courses are designed to develop self-reliance, confidence, initiative, honor, and a sense of duty as a citizen. College Scholarship Program Scholarships are available to qualifying students entering or enrolled in the University Air Force or Army ROTC programs. Scholarship consideration is predicated on student ability, performance, and potential. In order to accept the scholarship, if offered, the student must enroll in ROTC. These ROTC scholarships provide up to full payment for tuition (resident and non-resident), laboratory expenses, certain fees, textbook allowance of $480-$600 per year, and an allowance of $250-$400 per month, tax free, depending on academic year. Details of the scholarship program may be obtained from the ROTC department concerned. Refer to the following sections for names of persons who can supply additional information.

University-Wide Instructional Programs 107understanding of the concepts of aerospace power and the Air Force mission, organization, and operation. Enrollment in AFROTC is voluntary and accomplished through the fall and spring registration periods. Scholarships are available in many academic disciplines on a competitive basis. Approximately one-third of the students hold scholarships. Depending on the semester, approximately one-quarter of the cadet corps consists of women. Almost all Air Force career fields are open to women, including pilot positions. General Program Both two- and four-year Air Force ROTC programs are offered. The four-year program consists of the General Military Course (GMC) during the freshman and sophomore years and the Professional Officer Course (POC) the remaining two years of college. Those students who elect not to participate in the GMC may substitute a six-week summer field training period for this requirement. Four-year cadets participate in a four-week field training period during the summer between their sophomore and junior years. Minor in Aerospace Studies The minor in aerospace studies is offered to any student completing the course of study listed below. In addition to studying Air Force organizations, missions, and operations, the student will gain a broad perspective of the military in general by studying the history of all Department of Defense Services and completing at least one Army ROTC course, thus emphasizing our country's focus on \"joint\" military operations.

The number of 100- and 200-level MS courses taken will determine the number of credits awarded for MS 250. 2Students who have taken all of the Basic Course (MS 110, MS 121, MS 210, MS 221) or have completed Basic Training as a prior service member are not eligible to take MS 250. 3Students may be given transfer credit for prior military service that can be applied to lower division credits. 4Attendence at the five-week Army ROTC Advanced Camp (MS 386) is normally the summer between the junior and senior years. Flight Training After commissioning flight training is available, although competitive, to those officers who have taken and passed the flight physical and flight aptitude test and have been selected for service within the Aviation Branch. The test is normally administered during the MS III or junior year of ROTC. Training may include fixed wing or rotary wing (helicopter) training. General Program The military science program is subdivided into two levels. The basic course is aligned with the freshman and sophomore years and consists of the fundamentals of leadership and management, land navigation, small unit operations, survival, and rappelling. The advanced course, paralleling the junior and senior years, covers leadership assessment, military history, and ethics and professionalism. It also includes leadership skills that prepare the cadet for entry into active or reserve duty as a commissioned officer. Participation in leadership laboratories is open to all students who successfully complete the necessary prerequisites. Two-Year and Graduate Degree Programs A two-year program is also available for students who have not taken the first two years of ROTC or those who have completed an undergraduate degree and are seeking a two-year graduate program. This program requires the student to attend a summer camp at Fort Knox, Kentucky, between the sophomore and junior years. This four-week course consists of basic military training and allows the student to enter the advanced course upon return to campus. Another option toward an officer's commission is the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP). This program allows a cadet who is a member of a reserve or National Guard unit to be in the advanced course of ROTC, be paid at the E-5 drill pay rate, work as an officer trainee in their unit, and compete for a reserve or active duty commission. Students can also receive the Reserve GI Bill and tuition assistance while in Army ROTC. The military science curriculum is intended to enrich and supplement baccalaureate or postgraduate studies in all fields. The Army recognizes the need for officers with varied academic credentials and will award a commission to students who successfully complete ROTC. Scholarships Colorado State Army ROTC scholarship students are awarded full tuition (in-state and out-of-state), fees, and an additional $600 per year for books. In addition to the above, Congress has increased the monthly stipend to $250 per month. The stipend increases each year the student remains in the program, up to a maximum of $400 per month. Applications for the four-year scholarship can be requested by calling 1-800-USA-ROTC (or online at www.ROTC.monroe.army.mil ). Two- and three-year scholarship interviews for sophomores and freshmen, respectively, are done January to February annually. Financial Assistance Opportunities In addition to two-, three- and four-year scholarships, Army ROTC has the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP), which provides additional experience and financial assistance from two sources: a National Guard or Reserve unit and Army ROTC. SMP students may also qualify for GI Bill funds, loan repayment money, and up to 100% tuition assistance money, based on available funding.

Heird, Associate Dean UNDERGRADUATE MAJORS Agricultural Business Agricultural Economics Agricultural Education Animal Sciences Equine Sciences HorticultureLandscape Architecture Landscape Horticulture Soil and Crop Sciences UNDERGRADUATE MINORS Agricultural and Resource Economics HorticultureLandscape Horticulture Soil Resources and Conservation Agriculture was the first science . . . the progenitor of sciences . . . and it remains the science that supports human life. It also is a science concerned with improving the quality of life and maintaining a productive, quality environment. Agricultural programs integrate biological, physical, and social sciences with agricultural sciences. Students may look forward to careers in basic and applied research; production and utilization of food and related products; resource use and conservation; industry and business; education and public service; technical and professional services; professional, scientific, and technical communication; and institutional and governmental. COLLEGE PROGRAMS Undergraduate Majors Undergraduate programs lead to a bachelor of science degree which requires a minimum of 120 credits with a minimum of 42 credits in upper-division courses. No more than 16 credits from independent study and/or internship courses may be used in fulfillment of the 120 credits. Information on interdepartmental and departmental majors, the various concentrations available, and career opportunities are described on the fo llowing pages. Students may consider simultaneously completing the requirements for a second major. See Second Major Requirements in the Degree Programs chapter of this catalog for a complete description of the program. Internships Students are encouraged to select an internship with an approved cooperator. The student's department determines the number of allowable credits. Internships are available each term including the summer term. Internships normally require 40 hours of contact per academic credit and do allow a stipend to be provided. Application should be made to the department at least 30 days before the term of the internship. Study Abroad Study abroad programs are available to students in the College of Agricultural Sciences. Because the knowledge of at least one other culture is valuable in understanding our own, students are encouraged to study outside the United States as part of their overall program at Colorado State University. Students interested in study abroad should plan in advance by discussing opportunities with their academic adviser and by visiting the Office of International Programs in Laurel Hall ( www.international.colostate.edu/study abroad). Transfer of Credits from Other Institutions Students who expect to transfer to the College of Agricultural Sciences are advised to plan carefully and in advance of their planned transfer to insure that transfer credits meet required courses in their chosen major. Transfer evaluations are generally determined by the registrar's office, although departments determine transfer of courses required by the department. See the Web address http://tes.colostate.edu for detailed information. (Note: Credits from two-year colleges are not accepted for 300 and above level courses at Colorado State.)

College of Agricultural Sciences 112INTERDEPARTMENTAL MAJOR Office in Shepardson Building, Room 121 (970) 491-6274 www.agsci.colostate.edu Associate Dean James C. Heird, Coordinator Major in Agricultural Education Agricultural education is an interdepartmental major in both the College of Agricultural Sciences and the School of Education and is ranked in the top 20 in the nation. It prepares students for teaching youth and adults in the agricultural industry. Students refine their communication skills and personal qualities necessary to serve as educational leaders and managers. Learning Outcomes The successful student will demonstrate: xCompetent knowledge of agricultural subject matter to be taught xAbility to create instruction opportunities that are adapted to diverse learners in agricultural education. xEmployment of innovative instructional methodologies to promote student success in agricultural education xEffective leadership to the FFA and in supervising agricultural programs/projects for high school students. Potential Occupations Graduates in agricultural education are in demand to fill a fifteen-year shortage of agricultural teachers in Colorado and nationwide. Two-thirds of the Colorado State graduates have become teachers or administrators in public schools. Other graduates take agribusiness positions with seed, fertilizer, feed, machinery, or finance firms. Students are also prepared to teach in community or junior colleges, area vocational schools, and technical institutes. Participation in internships is required to enhance practical training and development. Graduates who go on for advanced studies can attain more responsible positions with the possibility of rising to top professional levels. Some examples include: high school agriculture teacher; post-secondary vocational agriculture teacher; agriservice education specialist; 4-H association youth specialist; youth development specialist; science teacher. Agricultural education leads to teacher licensure by the State of Colorado. Teachers combine classroom, laboratory, and hands-on experiences to teach high school students about the myriad agricultural topics. The curriculum requires students to demonstrate a competent knowledge of educational theory and a broad-based understanding in agricultural content. Students combine practical experience and technical course work including animal science, plant science, agricultural mechanics, forestry, natural resources, horticulture, agricultural processing and supplies, and services in agriculture. Courses from biological sciences, liberal arts, and social sciences round out a student's education. Students must apply to the Teacher Licensure Program in the School of Education after they have completed at least 30 college credits, usually during their sophomore or junior year. A few of the requirements for acceptance are: having at least a 2.75 cumulative GPA, completion of an introductory education course, and 20 hours of documented work experience with school-age children. This curriculum includes instructional methods and assessment, classroom management and technology, exceptionality, and courses specific to teaching in the agricultural field. All students are required to student teach for one semester. Students interested in pursuing a teaching license through Colorado State University may refer to the School of Education section in this catalog for general information. Detailed information about the Educator Licensing Program and licensure requirements are available on the program's Web site ( http://teachered.colostate.edu/ ) or in room 111 of the Education Building.

DEPARTMENT OF HORTICULTURE AND LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE Office in Shepardson Building, Room 111 (970) 491-7019 http://hla.colostate.edu Professor Stephen J. Wallner, Head Major in Horticulture Horticulture is the application of scientific principles in the growing, marketing, processing, and utilizing of fruits, vegetables, flower and foliage plants, trees, shrubs, and turfgrasses. The major requires a strong grounding in botany, chemistry, horticulture, and business. There are four concentrations in the horticulture major - floriculture, horticultural business management, horticultural food crops, and horticultural science. Learning Outcomes Successful students will demonstrate: xTechnical competence that includes understanding plant growth and development as influenced by the manipulations of horticulture technologies such as greenhouse management, fertility management, integrated pest management, etc. xManagement and leadership skills that will allow them to become an entry-level supervisor in a specific business or research program xProblem solving skills such as identifying the significance of a problem, researching realistic solutions using current literature, and organizing the materials to develop appropriate recommendations and actions. Potential Occupations A major challenge facing the horticulture industry today is keeping up with demand for its services. There is a growing need for well-educated professional horticulturists. The industry will be looking for professionals who can manage greenhouses, nurseries, and floral outlets, buy and sell supplies and equipment, or edit journals and newsletters. Meeting the nutritional needs of the world population is an important challenge. Researchers are needed to develop improved fruit and vegetable varieties. Other professionals are needed to improve production and transportation methods and to develop and market better fertilizers. Within this field, students can exercise their talents and interests in computers, construction, engineering, chemistry, physics, social services, art, or business management. Participation in internships and coope rative education opportunities is highly recommended to enhance practical training and development. Graduates who go on for advanced studies can attain more responsible positions with the possibility of rising to top professional levels. Some examples include: biotechnologist; commercial fruit and produce buyer; extension specialist; floriculturist; fruit and vegetable grower; greenhouse supplies/seed sales representative; greenhouse production manager; interior plant maintenance technician; irrigation designer; marketing representative; plant breeder; produce buyer. Floriculture Concentration Floriculture emphasizes greenhouse-grown flower crops. Students study propagation, production, utilization, and improvement of plants, and are prepared to grow quality greenhouse products. Courses include the production, use, and marketing of cut flowers, bedding, and pot plants, which give this concentration its focus. Students are also required to take practicum and an internship in their junior and/or senior years. A number of opportunities exist in floriculture-related professions including greenhouse production, all phases of retail and wholesale floral business, greenhouse supply sales, greenhouse construction and computerized environmental control, plant breeding and plant research.

Major in Landscape Architecture Studying landscape architecture at Colorado State is an adventure. Taking part in a challenging course of study, students prepare themselves for careers in a field whose enormous potential has only begun to be recognized. Landscape architecture students study design as accomplished landscape architects see it: shaping spaces as well as planning and preserving them. Landscape architects create and design detailed landscape plans to be functional, aesthetic, and compatible with the natural environment. Throughout the program, emphasis is on the relationship between design, nature, and society: the impact of environments on the individual as well as the impact of users on the environment. Registration laws for landscape architects in 45 states encourage graduation from programs such as that offered at Colorado State University, which is accredited by the Landscape Architecture Accreditation Board of the American Society of Landscape Architects. Landscape architects must analyze the natural elements of a site including the climate, soil, slope of the land, drainage, sunlight, and vegetation. Computer-aided design (CAD) has become an essential tool for landscape architects. Landscape architects often work with building architects, surveyors, engineers, and urban planners and collaborate with environmental scientists, foresters, and other professionals to find the best way to conserve or restore natural resources. Knowledge of appropriate local, state, or federal regulations such as those protecting wetlands or historic resources is essential. Nature, culture, form, and space are the classic elements of landscape architecture with which students work in a series of design studies and related courses. Coursework focuses on a variety of landscape projects that grow more complex as the curriculum proceeds. The courses include subjects such as site design, landscape design and construction, surveying, landscape ecology, and urban and regional planning. Other courses specific to the major are history of the designed landscape, plant and soil science, geology, and professional practice. Students are also encouraged to take advantage of summer travel courses available to study highly-valued ecological/cultural sites in Colorado and designed landscapes in Europe. Colorado State University offers the only nationally accredited undergraduate profe ssional landscape architecture program in Colorado. Learning Outcomes Successful students will demonstrate: xBasic problem solving skills and knowledge for comprehensive landscape design that include the following characteristics: 1) research of natural systems, cultural systems, users, and precedents; 2) analysis of related site systems and users; and 3) synthesis, the articulation of formal responses to research and analysis findings. xTechnical competency in basic landscape architectural methods and communication, including organization of writing, project development, representation, and documentation. xFundamental knowledge and skills appropriate to public and private entry-level landscape architecture including: 1) application of digital media; 2) technology applications for analysis and design; 3) landscape design; and 4) representation for analysis and design.

College of Agricultural Sciences 128Potential Occupations Many types of organizations and individuals hire landscape architects - from real estate development firms starting new projects, municipalities constructing airports or parks, to home owners desiring garden designs. Many landscape architects are employed by government agencies doing site design for buildings, parks, and other public assets. Others are involved in park and recreation planning in national parks and forests, and restoration of environmentally damaged landscapes. Employment of landscape architects is expected to increase faster than the average for all occupations through the year 2006. Starting in 1998, average salaries for landscape architects exceeded average salaries of architects. Anticipated growth in construction is expected to increase demand for landscape architectural services over the long run. Participation in internships and cooperative education opportunities is highly recommended to enhance practical training and development. Graduates who go on for advanced studies can attain more responsible positions with the possibility of rising to top professional levels. Some examples include: design consultant; landscape designer and contractor; private practice business; construction supervisor; land or environmental planner; urban designer; historic preservationist; golf course architect; resort planner.

DEPARTMENT OF SOIL AND CROP SCIENCES Office in Plant Science Building, C127 (970) 491-6517 www.colostate.edu/Depts/SoilCrop Professor Gary A. Peterson, Head Major in Soil and Crop Sciences Soil and crop sciences, the studies of field crops and soils, are the foundation sciences underlying the production and management of food, feed, and fiber crops to meet human needs and to protect the environment. Students are taught the importance of learning soil and crop science principles in alleviating concerns of rapidly increasing world populations, the demand on land for food supplies, and the demand for environmental quality to enhance human comfort and well being. Special emphasis is placed on improved production efficiency and the conservation of soil, chemicals, energy, plants, and water. The curriculum offers broad-based coverage of the basic natural and social sciences, communication skills, and opportunity to explore interests and leadership potential. Six concentrations allow for specialization in the major - agronomic production management; applied information technology; environmental soil science; international soil and crops; plant biotechnology, genetics, and breeding; and soil resources and conservation. However, students do not have to choose a concentration but are given the flexibility to tailor the curriculum to their individual interests. Learning Outcomes Successful students will demonstrate: xTechnical competencies, including knowledge and understanding of soil and crop science principles, ability to apply these principles to specific issues, and ability to synthesize information, both technical and non-technical, to meet identified needs. xProblem solving skills, such as identifying a problem, collecting data, summarizing information, and drawing conclusions to the identified problem. xProfessional skills, including interpersonal skills and communication skills, such as presenting a topic with logical development, technical understanding, mechanical and technique correctness, and accurate documentation of sources. Potential Occupations Participation in internships and cooperative education opportunities is highly recommended to enhance practical training and development. Paid summer internship positions exist for all students in this major, and often lead to a job after graduation. The job outlook for graduates is very optimistic, with more job openings than can be filled in some areas of study. Graduates work for a variety of federal, state, or local government agricultural agencies, state agricultural colleges or research stations, agricultural service companies, commercial research and development labs, and seed companies. Graduates who go on for advanced studies can attain more responsible positions with the possibility of rising to top professional levels. Some examples include: agronomic production manager; cooperative manager; international agronomist; land-use planner; plant geneticist; plant breeder, seed, chemical, and fertilizer consultant; soil conservation specialist; soil surveyor; waste management specialist; water quality specialist; crop production; chemical fertilizer sales; crop consultant; county agricultural extension agents; agricultural products inspector; farm manager.

Open Option Program Students who wish to explore the wide variety of choices available to them may enroll in the Applied Human Sciences Open Option program. Students will be encouraged to take electives that will help them explore the disciplines they are most interested in as possible career choices. At the same time, they will take courses common to one of the themes described earlier: design, consumer and family studies, human services, management, or natural sciences and technology. Study Abroad Because knowledge of at least one other culture is valuable in understanding our own, the College of Applied Human Sciences is strongly committed to the value of international study and encourages students to participate in study abroad programs. The College sponsors one of the University's study abroad programs, i.e., a program offered each spring semester at the University of Canberra (Australia). This and other formal Colorado State study abroad programs make it easy for students to transfer credits between universities and to have access to the richness of engaging knowledge from the perspectives of other countries. Students should plan for study abroad with their academic advisers far in advance (the junior year is usually the best time to study elsewhere), consult with the Office of International Programs in Laurel Hall and visit their Web site at http://www.international. colostate.edu/us/studyabroad .

Major in Interior Design The interior design program enhances the definition of the professional interior designer as qualified by education, experience, and examination to enhance the function and quality of life, increase productivity, and protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The program is accredited by the Foundation for Interior Design Education Research (FIDER). Assessment of student programs includes a design scenario. By limited enrollment through the design scenario, individual attention in advanced course work is increased. The design scenario is held once a year. Faculty in the interior design program value learning as a collaborative effort inviting diversity, design research as the root of excellence in design practice, and new models for learning to respond to new ways of working. The program guides students toward becoming dedicated interior designers who have strong communication skills, are active as team players and creative problem solvers, and who make a positive impact in the practice of interior design. Students engage in research-based problem solving, providing a solid transition from education to practice in a global community. The interior design graduate will learn the entirety of the design process, beginning with assessment of client needs through design programming, development of alternative design solutions, development of design intent, selection of furniture and finish materials, construction documentation, and contract administration including project management and post-occupancy evaluation methodologies. In addition, students take course work in construction/building systems and codes, business principles in interior design, computer-aided design and drafting, animation, multimedia, graphic visualization, interior design history, and sustainable practices. The teaching facilities include design studios, display, resource, and critique spaces, and computer labs. Learning Outcomes Interior design majors will: xProduce a research-based solution demonstrating depth of exploration in planning for a large-scale, complex facility with complexity and depth of exploration defined in terms of scale, detail, design elements inclusive in space, lighting requirements, and project definition as exemplified through presentation materials. xDemonstrate overall mastery of skills and knowledge identified by the Foundation for Interior Design Education Research (FIDER) accreditation measures ranging from understanding human behavior and design history to concept development. xDemonstrate oral, written, and graphic communication skills at the entry-level of the profession Potential Occupations Students are prepared as entry-level interior designers with competency in design fundamentals, space planning and programming, code compliance, lighting, materials research, project management, and professional practices in the design of diverse interior spaces. Graduates seek employment in interior design and architecture firms as residential, corporate, retail, health care, institutional, education, and hospitality designers. Other graduates work in lighting design, product development, marketing, research, design-related journalism, illustration, facility management, showroom management, and as manufacturers' representatives. Students interested in teaching interior design content at the secondary level should explore the college's interdepartmental major in consumer and family studies. The consumer and family studies education concentration allows students to combine their interests in apparel, merchandising, and/or interior design with teaching. Consumer and family studies students take course work in the Departments of Food Science and Human Nutrition, Design and Merchandising, and Human Development and Family Studies as well as complete an education sequence which qualifies them for a secondary teaching license. The demand for secondary consumer and family studies teachers exceeds the supply in Colorado as well as nationally. Therefore, job placement is extremely high with starting salaries in the $24,000-$32,000 range for a nine-month teaching position.

DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND FAMILY STUDIES Office in Gifford Building, Room 102 (970) 491-5558 http://www.cahs.colostate.edu/hdfs/ Professor Clifton E. Barber, Head Karen Rattenborg, Undergraduate Program Coordinator Associate Professor Karen C. Barrett, Graduate Program Coordinator Major in Human Development and Family Studies Human development and family studies is a major focusing on the interdisciplinary study of the development of individuals and families across the lifespan. In the contexts of culture and family, students learn to identify factors influencing cognitive, emotional, social, and physical development in infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and later adulthood. Students complete foundational course work in life span human development (infancy and childhood, adolescence and young adulthood, middle and later adulthood/aging) and in the area of family studies. Students also complete a prescribed series of experiential learning courses designed to provide opportunities to apply knowledge acquired in foundational course work. Additionally, students have the opportunity to take elective courses that support future aspirations related to careers and/or post-baccalaureate programs. With regard to careers, the HDFS curriculum prepares students to work with individuals and families in a broad range of contexts. Students interested in teaching human development and family studies content at the secondary level should explore the interdepartmental major in consumer and family studies, education concentration, at the beginning of this college section. The consumer and family studies education concentration allows students to combine their interests in human/child development, marriage and family relationships, and/or parenting with teaching. Consumer and family studies students take course work in the Departments of Human Development and Family Studies, Food Science and Human Nutrition, and Design and Merchandising as well as complete an education sequence3 which qualifies them for a secondary teaching license. The demand for secondary consumer and family studies teachers exceeds the supply in Colorado as well as nationally. Therefore, job placement is extremely high with starting salaries in the $24,000-$32,000 range for a nine-month teaching position. Learning Outcomes Students will demonstrate: xAbility to complete courses and experiences that support their career goals. xDevelopment of effective intervention/educational programs based on their knowledge of theory, normative behavior, family functioning, and ecological factors. xAbility to critically evaluate research and use of research to design simple program evaluations, and use of the computer skills required to support this objective; to conduct literature searches, find information related to needs assessment, find evaluation measures, and do research-based presentations using PowerPoint. Potential Occupations Human development and family studies graduates are prepared to work in a variety of human service settings including youth services organizations; early childhood, elementary, and parent education programs; allied health care; juvenile and adult corrections; family and community services; and programs serving older adults, including long-term care facilities. Graduates are also well prepared to pursue advanced degrees in the behavioral and social sciences or other professional programs.

Preparation for Teacher Licensure in Early Childhood and Elementary Education A major in human development and family studies provides a strong foundation for students desiring a license to teach young children between the ages of 0 and 8. Knowledge of lifespan developmental processes and family systems prepares future teachers to work in partnership with parents and grandparents in educating children. Human development and family studies students aspiring to work with children between the ages of 0 and 8 can apply during their sophomore year to become part of the Early Childhood Teacher Licensure Program. If accepted, students take course work in the School of Education requiring a 4 semester (2 year) commitment in addition to completing their human development and family studies degree requirements. The Early Childhood Teacher Licensure Program uses a cohort model, and admits a limited number of students, typically between 25-35, each year. The admission process takes place once a year in the spring with the admitted candidates starting in the fall.

SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK Office in Education Building, Room 127 (970) 491-6612 http://www.cahs.colostate.edu/sw/ Professor Deborah Valentine, Director and Graduate Coordinator Associate Professor Victor A. Baez, Undergraduate Coordinator Major in Social Work Social work is distinguished by a tradition of concern for people and their interactions with society. Social work professionals are community problem solvers who intervene in organizational settings - communities, school systems, or families - to assist with individual needs. Most social workers specialize in a single field such as child welfare and family services, mental health, medical social work, school social work, criminal justice, community organization, or advocacy. The social work curriculum focuses on the practical application of social work principles, policies, and practices within systems and social justice perspectives. Students acquire a professional social work foundation transferable to different settings, population groups, and problem areas. Attention is devoted to understanding the social welfare system in the U.S., and working with individuals, families, and communities to affect the desired change. Several practical experiences are required. Students work with an agency participant throughout their sophomore year, and then as seniors, participate in a social work agency internship. The curriculum also includes a strong liberal arts base in social science research and statistics, arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Learning Outcomes Graduating seniors will have demonstrated: xSkills in conceptualizing and applying knowledge of social welfare policy and services, accessing community resources, and utilizing community policy making processes and practices. xKnowledge and mastery of skills in establishing helping relationships, using established interviewing techniques, manifesting genuineness, respecting the client's definition of the problem, maintaining focus, exploring feelings, and conveying non-judgmental attitudes. xUnderstanding of the social work code of ethics and mastery of skills in maintaining client confidentiality, establishing professional boundaries, and resolving ethical dilemmas that are presented in case scenarios. Potential Occupations Social work graduates are employed in a variety of settings including welfare agencies, schools, hospitals, clinics, institutions, community centers, public health, corrections, and group homes. Entry-level job opportunities are plentiful. Graduate should be willing to work with people of all ages and in a multitude of circumstances and settings. Opportunities to work with older adults are especially prevalent. Internships are required. Graduates who achieve a masters of social work (MSW) degree attain the ability to intervene in a variety of situations, coordinate services, and supervise other workers. Advancement generally requires an MSW. Some examples of career opportunities include, but are not limited to: child welfare worker; adolescent group home counselor; crisis counselor; child protection; adult clinical geriatric social work; case manager; nursing home administrator; medical social service counselor; community outreach coordinator; youth program counselor; home health aide; occupational social services worker; foster parent probation officer; advocate; victim-witness program program manager; school social services; substance abuse counselor. Practicum, Internship, and Progression Requirements Students directly apply classroom knowledge, skills, and social work values through a six-credit supervised practicum, SW 286A and B, in the sophomore year. During this practicum, students must formally apply for Progression to the Major. To comply with accreditation standards that require systematic evaluation of programs and students, faculty will review student progress towards completion of this professional degree at the end of the first semester for juniors or at the end of the second semester for sophomores in the SW 286 practicum. Students must have an overall 2.0 GPA, and a 2.5 GPA with no grade less than C in any required social work course before being allowed to continue in the program. In addition, students will prepare a professional statement concerning their informed choice of social work as a profession. The professional statement will be evaluated by the student's adviser on the basis of content (i.e., fit with the social work profession) and the quality of written communication skills. Students will also be asked to review the Social Work Code of Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

If progression requirements are not met, or if the Bachelor's Program Director has any questions, student materials will be reviewed by the School's Administrative Team. A full faculty review may be recommended as a next step. The adviser will inform the student, in writing, of the recommended actions. These actions may include: 1) additional course work; 2) a probationary period; 3) consideration of a change of major; 4) dismissal from the social work program. Students may appeal these decisions using the established School and University grievance procedures. After progression into the major, students must continue to maintain a 2.0 overall GPA and a 2.5 GPA with no grade less than C in any social work course. Students will be required to retake any social work course (SW prefix) in which a grade of C or better is not achieved. In the senior year, students fulfill a 10-credit field placement in a social work agency or program in community settings. Examples of available field placements include child and public welfare programs; hospitals; homeless and women's shelters; rehabilitation and mental health agencies; schools; adolescent residential care; geriatric centers; and correction programs. Under supervision, students have the opportunity to evaluate their practice interventions. The social work program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. Application for student membership in the professional organization, the National Association of Social Workers, is available through the School office.

Students interested in study abroad should plan far in advance by discussing opportunities with their academic adviser and by visiting the Office of International Programs in Laurel Hall or the Web site, www.international.colostate.edu/us/studyabroad . Major in Business Administration The College of Business prepares students with the knowledge and skills needed to become effective leaders and decision makers in today's dynamic business environment. Additional objectives are to prepare students to teach business subjects in secondary schools, and to provide opportunities for non-business majors to gain an understanding of the business environment as well as specific business and management activities. The four-year curriculum leads to a bachelor of science degree with a major in business administration. The program focuses on global orientation, technology, business processes, and corporate social responsibility. Lower-division work provides a cultural and analytical foundation. Upper-division work provides sufficient specialized work in business disciplines to prepare students to enter their chosen fields in the business world. At the same time, the program attempts to develop the attitudes and analytical abilities required for future professional advancement. The College of Business has a strong reputation among regional, national, and international employers. As a whole, graduates from the College of Business are better prepared to enter challenging positions. The program centers on an approach which emphasizes: knowledge of concepts, processes, and institutions; understanding of the financial, economic, legal, ethical, social, and organizational influences; informational systems; and interpersonal communications. The senior capstone course offers an opportunity for students to apply these skills in a learning environment. All undergraduate business majors must complete the All- University Core Curriculum as part of their graduation requirement. Coordinated with this general education, all business students take business core subjects plus a concentration with its specified course sequence. Fifty percent of the total credits required for the business core and concentration must be completed at Colorado State University. Each student selects an area of concentration in one of the following fields: accounting, finance and real estate, computer information systems, marketing, or organizational management. Additionally, students may qualify to teach business subjects at the secondary and postsecondary levels by completing the requirements for the business education and marketing education teacher licensure and credentialing program. Admission to teacher licensure is through the School of Education, College of Applied Human Sciences.

DEPARTMENT OF ACCOUNTING Office in Rockwell Hall, Room 205 (970) 491-5102; (970) 491-2676 (fax) http://www.biz.colostate.edu/accounting Professor F. C. \"Ted\" Watson, Acting Chair Accounting Concentration This program is designed to give students an understanding of the theory and practice of the major fields of accounting: financial reporting, managerial accounting, taxation, and auditing. Accountants provide financial information and documentation about businesses to managers, investors, creditors, and other interested parties. Accounting can be categorized into management accounting, which provides information for internal decision makes (e.g., managers); and financial accounting, which provides information for external decision makers (e.g., investors, analysts, and creditors). Accounting is an ever-evolving field with growing importance in most profit and not-for-profit firms. Today, accountants are business leaders and participate in business decisions and strategy formulation. Accountants must be able to explain and analyze business data, excel in communications, teamwork, leadership, and possess technical and computer-based skills. The accountant in an increasingly global society is rapidly becoming both an information specialist as well as a business advisor. Accountants also act as the moral and ethical compass for business practices. The accounting curriculum at Colorado State University satisfies current educational requirements to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) in the State of Colorado. (Requirements to become a CPA are unique to each state and students should be aware of requirements of the state in which they intend to practice.) The curriculum also prepares students to become a Certified Management Accountant (CMA) or Certified Internal Auditor (CIA). The accounting curriculum is designed to meet the needs of those who seek professional education and training to practice as public, private, or governmental accountants, or expect to work in business managerial positions requiring an understanding of fundamental accounting concepts and principles. The curriculum offers considerable flexibility in designing a program of study that will meet a variety of career interests. In addition to the All-University Core Curriculum and the College of Business Core Curriculum, students are particularly encouraged to take additional course work in both finance and computer information systems. Learning Outcomes Students will demonstrate: xKnowledge of the principles of auditing and attestation xKnowledge of the fundamental concepts of financial accounting and reporting xKnowledge of the fundamental concepts of managerial accounting and decision making xLegal knowledge of taxation (federal, state, personal) xKnowledge of business ethics and principles of social responsibility xKnowledge of business organization, processes, and understanding of accounting-based systems integration issues Potential Occupations Some examples include, but are not limited to: accountant or auditor of publicly or privately held companies, government agencies, or not-for-profit institutions; consultant in firms providing professional management services; public, private, or personal tax specialist; financial analyst; finance and real estate planning; bank administration.

C. Ferrell, Chair Marketing Concentration This program will provide its students with a comprehensive knowledge of organizational marketing along with the skills necessary for effective decision making in a business environment that is diverse, global, and highly competitive. Marketing is the process of planning and executing the conception, pricing, promotion, and distribution of ideas, goods, and services to consumers, industrial customers, governments, and social agencies. Both profit and nonprofit organizations engage in marketing activities such as conducting market research, planning, and developing new products and services, advertising, selling, and retaining satisfied customers. Marketing is people-oriented and ever changing. A person's analytical abilities, imagination, and creative potential are brought to bear on continuously evolving tasks and goals. In addition to the All-University Core Curriculum, course work for a major in business administration-marketing includes calculus, economics, statistics, and business principles along with courses that specifically examine marketing and management issues and practices. Learning Outcomes By the completion of their degree, marketing students will have demonstrated: xAbility to identify a marketing problem and key influences on that problem, to use appropriate qualitative and quantitative analysis to evaluate the marketing problem, and to evaluate alternative solutions by assessing their strengths and weaknesses. xAbility to make a final recommendation that thoroughly addresses the problem/opportunity based on: making reasonable assumptions; considering appropriate customer, competitor, and company constraints; clearly addressing the marketing issues; and demonstrating an Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

Engineers are critically involved in every facet of modern technological society, processing information, designing systems and equipment, maintaining society's infrastructure, solving environmental and energy problems, and helping attain desired levels of efficiency and comfort. The College of Engineering continues its tradition - a tradition as old as Colorado State - of providing broad training in the basic fields of engineering through both undergraduate instruction and graduate programs strongly supported by modern research facilities. COLLEGE PROGRAMS All engineering programs except engineering science are accredited at the basic level by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). Undergraduate programs are administered by the Departments of Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. These departments offer four-year programs leading to a bachelor of science degree. Although emphasis is on broad training in basic engineering, students may specialize to some extent by proper choice of technical electives. A program leading to a bachelor of science degree in environmental engineering is administered by the Department of Civil Engineering. This program, which builds upon a foundation in biological science as well as mathematics and physical science, is supported by faculty from the Departments of Atmospheric Science, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. It has a strong interdisciplinary flavor and prepares students for careers with large industries, consulting companies, and regulatory agencies. A program leading to a bachelor of science degree with a major in engineering science is coordinated by the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs in the College of Engineering. This program offers four concentrations: engineering physics, international engineering and international students (jointly with the College of Liberal Arts), space engineering, and a dual degree in the College of Liberal Arts and a B.S. degree in the College of Engineering. Students may consider simultaneously completing the requirements for a second major. See Second Major Requirements in the Degree Program chapter for a complete description of the program. A student may pursue a minor program of study inside or outside the College of Engineering in conjunction with the desired engineering major. International Opportunities Study abroad programs are available to students in the College of Engineering. Because knowledge of at least one other culture is valuable in understanding our own, students are strongly encouraged to take a summer or semester to study outside the United States as part of their overall program at Colorado State University. Students interested in study abroad should plan, far in advance, by discussing opportunities with their academic adviser and by visiting the Office of International Programs in Laurel Hall or the Web sitehttp://www.international.colostate.edu/studyabroad. Students can obtain a concentration in international engineering and international studies in the Engineering Science major. See the Interdepartmental Majors section for more information.

College of Engineering 177Registration as a Professional Engineer Registration and licensing are required under certain legally defined circumstances in order to practice as an engineer. The College of Engineering actively encourages all of its students from the ABET accredited majors to fulfill the necessary requirements as soon as they are eligible. The Fundamentals of Engineering Examination (FE) administered by the State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Professional Land Surveyors may be taken by seniors from ABET accredited programs during the two semesters prior to graduation. After the required practical experience, the Principles and Practice of Engineering Examination (PE) for licensing may be taken. Engineering Field Trips The first Fridays of November and March are set aside for departmental field trips primarily to industrial and research organizations in Colorado. Specific requirements of the field trips are established by individual departments. Transportation expense of trips is borne by the student. ADMISSION INFORMATION Students may be admitted to one of the undergraduate majors in this college or as undecided freshmen (Engineering Open Option). Undecided engineering students must specify their choice of major prior to registration for the sophomore year. Should the demand for any engineering major exceed the capacity to maintain a high-quality education, the college may find it necessary to limit enrollment in some majors. The undecided engineering student who wishes to transfer to one of these majors may be at a disadvantage when demand exceeds capacity. In general, students are better served by selecting one of the college's majors at admission and then changing majors, if necessary, than by entering as undecided freshmen. High School Graduates See Undergraduate Admission Policies and Procedures section in this catalog for specific College of Engineering requirements. The required units listed are minimums. Students desiring to enter the engineering majors are urged to take available advanced math and English classes as well as courses in computer programming, physics, and mechanical drawing or three-dimensional representation (art). Course Placement and Advising for Freshmen All entering freshmen are required to take composition and mathematics placement examinations prior to registration. The examination results, together with other information about students, are used by faculty advisers to counsel students. Those with weaknesses in mathematics may be advised to take up to five math review courses before enrolling in calculus (M CC 160). Credits for review courses may not be used toward a degree in engineering. Transfer Students Students who wish to transfer into engineering must have completed at least one semester of calculus and one semester of calculus-based physics or chemistry equivalent to C CC 111, with at least one B and nothing less than a C. Should the demand for any engineering major exceed the capacity to maintain a high-quality education, individual departments may find it necessary to enforce more stringent requirements. Transfer advisers in each department are available for assisting students who wish to transfer. Transfer of credits earned at other colleges and universities within Colorado is facilitated by the existence of standing agreements on course equivalencies. Change of Major to Engineering Students who wish to change from another major at Colorado State to an engineering major must have one semester of physics (PHCC 141) or chemistry (C CC 111) with at least one B and nothing less than a C and a minimum 2.3 grade point average. Some majors may specify more stringent math, science, and grade point average requirements to be eligible for consideration. Students are selected for admission once each term; the number of students admitted is based on space available as well as academic criteria. Some majors may specify more stringent requirements in math and science courses. Engineering courses are normally open to engineering majors only. The change of major must be initiated at the Center for Advising and Student Achievement (CASA). CURRICULAR REQUIREMENTS The curricula of the College of Engineering include courses in engineering, mathematics, science, humanities, and social sciences. During the first two years, all engineering students take a program emphasizing mathematics, physics, chemistry, and basic engineering since all branches of engineering rely on this foundation. The junior and senior years are devoted primarily to a balanced selection of specialized engineering courses. The minimum credits for graduation with a bachelor of science degree varies with the engineering major. Good engineers are not only competent to render professional service in their fields of specialization, but are able to assume responsibilities as citizens. To broaden the students' perspectives in non-technical areas, the programs in engineering require a minimum of 15 credits in arts and Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

Courses in art, geography, music, speech, and theatre may also be selected with the prior approval of the adviser. These courses must be selected in such a way that they also meet All-University Core Curriculum requirements. The ability to express oneself clearly and concisely in both written and oral forms is an asset of great value to the engineer who is constantly called upon to prepare reports in which clarity, organization, and precision are essential. For this reason, engineering students must do more than meet the minimum English course requirements. In fact, the development of communication skills is emphasized throughout the engineering curricula. This emphasis is especially evident in laboratory and design-oriented courses, in which the presentation of both oral and written reports is a major component. The College of Engineering requires a minimum grade point average of 2.0 in required engineering, mathematics, chemistry, and physics courses as a graduation requirement. A student who has less than this average at the end of any term is subject to referral by the department head or college dean to the Committee on Scholastic Standards and Awards for consideration of academic dismissal from the College of Engineering. Additional minimum grade requirements apply in some engineering majors. An engineer applies physical understanding and analytical techniques to the design of devices and systems needed by modern society. The preparation of an engineer, therefore, must include engineering design experience. To meet this objective, all undergraduate engineering students must participate in a well-structured sequence of design-related courses culminating in a capstone design experience in order to graduate. INTERDEPARTMENTAL MAJORS Major in Engineering Science Office in Engineering Building, Room 102 Engineering science is an interdisciplinary major that allows students to acquire a strong base in mathematics, the physical sciences, and engineering fundamentals while pursuing a broad background in the liberal arts and other areas of interest in preparation for specialized careers or graduate studies. The major provides comprehensive undergraduate engineering education in selected fields which are not served by traditional engineering programs available at Colorado State University. Four concentrations are available - engineering physics, international engineering and international studies, space engineering, and the dual degree program in engineering and the liberal arts. Regardless of the concentration, graduates are well prepared for a professional career. These degrees are not ABET accredited programs. Learning Outcomes Individuals graduating from the engineering science major will have displayed: xFamiliarity with fundamentals of mathematics, science, and the engineering sciences; xUse of the fundamental, experiential, experimental and technical aspects of engineering; xDemonstration of strong problem solving skills, related to both closed-form and open-ended problems; xRecognition of the professional nature of engineering, through ethics, contact with practicing professionals and professional societies; xStudy and experience of multidisciplinary group dynamics and communication; xAppreciation for subject areas beyond the traditional engineering science, mathematics, and sciences required in engineering majors; and xAppreciation of the need for life-long learning. Potential Occupations Engineering science graduates are well rounded in mathematics, sciences, humanities, and social and behavioral sciences. They are well prepared to enter a career in engineering, or to proceed to graduate school in one of the traditional engineering disciplines. Graduates of the liberal arts-engineering science dual major often move on to professional programs in medicine, law, veterinary medicine, or business. Moreover, these graduates are suited for a wide range of occupations in addition to engineering. Participation in internships or volunteer activities is highly recommended to enhance practical training and development. Graduates who continue on with advanced studies can attain more responsible positions with the possibility of rising to top professional levels. Some examples include: space engineer, solid-state electronics engineer, and aerospace engineer.

The College offers courses in the arts, humanities, and social sciences, which are the foundation of a liberal arts education. Students who major in one of the liberal arts are prepared for a wide variety of careers in areas such as teaching, research, communication, journalism, music therapy, the arts, business, industry, and government, as well as graduate study in the arts, humanities, and social sciences and professional training in the law, ministry, and foreign service. COLLEGE PROGRAMS Undergraduate majors lead to one of three degrees: bachelor of arts, bachelor of fine arts, or bachelor of music. Descriptions of the specific departmental and interdepartmental majors and concentrations in the College of Liberal Arts are located on the following pages. Students should consider simultaneously completing the requirements of a second major, a minor, or an interdisciplinary studies program, either in the College of Liberal Arts or in another college. With careful planning, numerous combinations are possible within four years of study. The minimum scholastic average acceptable for graduation in any college program is a 2.0 average in all major courses in addition to the overall grade point average requirement of 2.0 for Colorado State courses. Prelaw Offices in Clark Building, Rooms C346 and B349 Students preparing for law school can choose any major. Law schools seek above-average students with broad educational backgrounds and excellent communication and analytical skills. Prelaw students, regardless of major, should design a course of study which develops their skill in speaking and writing; their insight into social, cultural, economic, and political forms, and their analytical capabilities. Law schools generally require an undergraduate degree for admission.

College of Liberal Arts 194International Studies and Careers The College of Liberal Arts encourages students to consider study abroad, international travel, and international careers. Study Abroad Because the knowledge of at least one other culture is valuable in understanding our own, students are encouraged to take a semester or longer to study outside of the United States as part of their overall program at Colorado State University. Students interested in study abroad should plan, far in advance, by discussing opportunities with their adviser and by visiting the Office of International Programs in Laurel Hall or the Web site www.international.colostate. edu/studyabroad. Foreign Service Officer Career Students wishing a foreign service officer career may prepare for both the general Foreign Service Officer Examination and the associated language examination within the following majors: economics; history; languages, literatures, and cultures; liberal arts, political science, sociology; or technical journalism. Graduate Programs A variety of liberal arts advanced degrees are available in the College. Academic degrees offered are doctor of philosophy, master of arts, master of science, master of fine arts, and master of music. The last two are generally considered professional degrees. The College has one interdisciplinary masters degree. The Departments of English, Journalism and Technical Communication, and Speech Communication cooperate to offer a master's degree program in communication development for teachers of communication skills in high schools, junior colleges, and some four year colleges as well as for communication positions in businesses. Information may be obtained from any participating department. For detailed information about graduate programs, contact individual departments. See also the Graduate and Professional Bulletin.

It includes such diverse fields as contemporary culture, ethnicity, linguistics, comparative religion, farming practices, archaeology, human ecology, human anatomy, evolution, and the behavior of non-human primates. Anthropology is a holistic field, and therefore, views the human condition as a result of the interaction of economics, social organization, history, technology, biology, ideology, and the environment. Majors can specialize in cultural anthropology, archaeology, and biological anthropology . Anthropology majors follow a liberal arts curriculum that provides a broad education with an emphasis on learning how to learn. Field classes that involve the excavation of archaeological sites are offered during the summer. Graduates should be able to view the human condition with equal ability from its behavioral, biological, and historical perspectives. The well-rounded liberal arts education plus acquisition of important marketable skills including analytical ability, communication, and people skills, make anthropology graduates valuable in business, government, and education. This is an extremely useful major for students who plan to pursue careers in which they anticipate contact with non-Western cultures; and, with careful planning, a second major in any field can be obtained to complement and enhance professional preparation. Learning Outcomes Students will: xDemonstrate knowledge related to basic appreciation of anthropology and its potentials including: 1) knowledge of and respect for the similarities and differences that characterize human societies in the world, over time and across space; 2) knowledge of key theoretical ideas that anthropologists use to comprehend these similarities and differences; 3) knowledge of key methods used to research and define the nature of similarities and differences in human societies; and 4) a grasp of the relationship between theory, methods, and data. xIntegrate anthropological concepts across subfields or with other social sciences and humanities disciplines, and articulate their anthropological understandings through papers written and presented during their senior year. xUse what they have learned in their anthropology courses in their future activities after graduation. Potential Occupations Anthropology, like many liberal arts majors, provides students with a broad academic background suitable for a variety of jobs in the public and private sectors. Anthropology majors are trained to think independently and critically, communicate effectively, and function in a multicultural world. Many employers appreciate liberal arts majors for their multiple skills and their ability to adapt to a variety of tasks and work environments. Participating in internships and coope rative education opportunities is highly recommended to enhance students' practical training and development. Careers for graduates are available in education, business, and government. Graduates who go on for advanced studies can pursue careers in anthropology or attain advanced positions with the possibility of rising to top professional levels. Some career opportunities for anthropology graduates include, but are not limited to: museum curator/researcher; genealogist; international relief representative; salvage archaeologist; collections resource specialist; classical or historical anthropologist; cultural affairs officer; diplomatic service representative; immigration or foreign medical anthropologist; writer; psychological pollster; sales/marketing representative; consultant for cross-cultural relations; personnel worker.

College of Liberal Arts 205DEPARTMENT OF ART Office in Visual Arts Building, Room G100 (970) 491-6774 http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Art/ Associate Professor Patrick Fahey, Co-Director, School of the Arts, and Chair, Department of Art Professor Tom Lundberg, Graduate Coordinator Major in Art Throughout history, art has been a fundamental language of the human spirit. Visual arts express human experience through an ever-widening range of media and materials, some of which include: oils, acrylics, pastels, charcoal, clay, plaster, steel, bronze, wood, copper, litho stones, and computers. Visual artists create abstract works and images of objects, people, nature, topography, and events. The Art Department offers several options of study. The B.F.A. (Bachelor of Fine Arts) degree in studio art and the B.A. (Bachelor of Arts) degree in art history, art education, or studio art are all professional degrees, leading to related art careers. Learning Outcomes Students will demonstrate: xFundamental knowledge and mastery of media and processes necessary to communicate meaning in a work of art. xAbility to communicate clearly about their own art and the art of others xKnowledge about contemporary art and motivation to view and discuss current local, regional, and national exhibitions. Students well versed on contemporary art would: 1) regularly read reviews of exhibitions in local and national newspapers; 2) regularly read art periodicals; 3) attend multiple exhibitions; and 4) be knowledgeable about contemporary artists in their discipline (i.e., nationally known painters, sculptors, etc.). Potential Occupations Art graduates possess a number of transferable communication, analytical, and critical thinking skills, and as a result find positions in government, industry, and academia, in addition to roles as freelance artists, graphic designers, art educators, art historians, and studio fine artists. Many employers appreciate art majors for their multiple skills and their ability to adapt to a variety of tasks and work environments. Participation in internships, cooperative education, and service learning opportunities is highly recommended to enhance practical training and development. Graduates who go on for advanced studies can attain more responsible positions with the possibility of rising to top professional levels. Depending on student interests, the electives taken, or the concentration selected, available career choices include, but are not limited to: art appraiser; art director; art therapist; educator; web page designer; photo lab technician; art restorer; and master printer. Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) The B.F.A. degree is a professional program for careers in studio art. Students have an opportunity to concentrate in one of nine studio fields: drawing, graphic design, fibers, metalsmithing, painting, photo image making, pottery, printmaking, andsculpture . The curriculum progression in the department is similar within the concentrations. Freshmen study foundation courses in the fine arts, which include drawing, painting, and sculpture, along with art history. Sophomores sample introductory concentration courses, and juniors and seniors focus on advanced topics in their chosen concentration by taking one upper-division course in their chosen field each semester. Bachelor of Fine Arts Core Courses A minimum grade of C (2.00) must be achieved in each upper-division art course in the student's concentration. The minimum scholastic average acceptable for graduation is 2.00 computed only for courses attempted at Colorado State.

Bachelor of Arts The B.A. degree has three areas of concentration available to students - art education, art history, and studio. Art Education Concentration The art education concentration embraces the artist-teacher concept, which allows students to develop a studio concentration while preparing to teach art at the K-12 level. The program is comprehensive, meaning students take course work to prepare them to teach at the elementary and secondary school levels. The art education program enjoys good working relationships with school districts in the state of Colorado. Students integrate studio, art history, criticism, and aesthetics as they observe and teach - through a variety of experiences - in the public schools. Students interested in pursuing a teaching license through Colorado State University may refer to the School of Education, College of Applied Human Sciences, section in this catalog for general information. Detailed information about the Educator Licensing Program and licensure requirements are available on the program's Web site (http://teachered.colostate.edu/ ) or in room 111 of the Education Building. A minimum grade of C (2.00) must be achieved in each upper-division art course in the student's concentration. The minimum scholastic average acceptable for graduation is 2.00 computed only for courses attempted at Colorado State.

DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS Office in Clark Building, Room C306 (970) 491-6324 http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Econ/ Professor Ronnie J. Phillips, Chair Associate Professor Charles Revier, Undergraduate Coordinator Professor Chuen-mei Fan, Graduate Coordinator Major in Economics Economics is the study of how people and societies use scarce resources to produce the things they want. Economic theory provides a framework for understanding economic issues, analyzing and predicting the likely effects of economic behavior and government policies, and formulating efficient and equitable solutions to pressing economic problems. A strong liberal arts curriculum including arts and humanities, social and natural sciences, advanced composition, mathematics, and statistics provides the depth and breadth of knowledge needed to systematically and logically analyze problems, generate and test ideas, and develop effective communication and quantitative skills. Economics majors develop an appreciation of economic issues, and learn to analyze and critically evaluate economic phenomena and policies. The major core includes four semesters of economic theory, a semester of econometrics, and several semesters of economics electives covering a wide variety of economic topics from environmental and natural resource economics to the history of economic institutions and Marxist economic thought. Learning Outcomes Students will: xDisplay command of basic microeconomic concepts such as rationality, cost/benefit, supply and demand theory, decision making at the margin, monopoly and competition, and efficiency and equity. xDisplay command of basic macroeconomic concepts such as aggregate demand and supply, fiscal and monetary policy, and the use of these policies in the macro-economy. xUnderstand and analyze basic economic issues found in the news and understand how the economic aspects of society work. Potential Occupations Economists are employed in a wide variety of fields from education and research to business and government. Nonprofit and international orga nizations use economists in overseas development, environmental conservation, and international relations. Economics, like many liberal arts majors, provides students with a broad academic background suitable for a variety of jobs. Economics majors are trained to think independently and critically, communicate effectively, and function in a multicultural world. Many employers appreciate liberal arts majors for their multiple skills and their ability to adapt to a variety of tasks and work environments. Careers for graduates are available in education, business, and government. Participation in internships or cooperative education opportunities is highly recommended to enhance practical training and development. Graduates who go on for advanced studies can pursue careers in economics or attain advanced positions with the possibility of rising to top professional levels. Depending on interests, the electives taken, or the minor selected, available career choices include, but are not limited Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

Saz, Chair Associate Professor Paola Malpezzi Price, Undergraduate Coordinator Associate Professor Jos\u00e9 Luis Suarez-Garcia, Graduate Coordinator Major in Languages, Literatures, and Cultures Gaining insight into a foreign culture through proficiency in its language and familiarity with its literature furthers intercultural understanding and interna tional perspectives in a student's total program of study. It is particularly valuable in fields such as social work, international relations and political science, international business or finance, computer science, tourism, and natural sciences. The programs in foreign languages emphasize oral and written proficiency. They also develop knowledge of the culture and literature, and the critical and analytical skills necessary for an understanding of their relationships. A major in a second language focuses on broadening and deepening proficiency and integrates this knowledge wit the strengths of a liberal arts curriculum. The department offers one major in languages, literatures, and cultures with concentrations in French, German, and Spanish. Language majors accomplish: xReal and measurable functional competencies in the target language; xA practical command of grammar and pronunciation approach that of a native speaker; xComprehension in reading and listening; xAbility in speaking and writing in a manner acceptable to an educated native; xA practical command of the culturally defined aspects of the language and related cultural patterns of behavior, including non-verbal communication; xIn advanced-level study, a comfortable familiarity with most of the language-and culture-specific characteristics of its literature. The department strongly encourages study abroad and has exchange agreements in place with universities in China, Japan, France, Spain, and Germany. Students should visit the department before going on study abroad for clarification on course transfers. A wide variety of other options are available through the Study Abroad Office on campus. Minors are offered in French, German, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. Basic courses may also be taken in Arabic, Chinese, Italian, and Latin. Learning Outcomes Students will demonstrate: xCommunicative oral skills in the target language, including grammatical accuracy, correct use of tense and aspect, fluency, appropriate intonation, suitable vocabulary and discourse devices when they express opinions or give research presentations. xCommunicative writing skills in the target language, including clarity of ideas, grammatical accuracy and appropriate vocabulary, adequate elaboration of ideas through a variety of sentence structures and vocabulary, and logical flow of ideas through the use of discourse organizational devices. xAnalytical skill in literary and cultural texts of the target language, including ability to formulate and present a topic of inquiry, to critically analyze the topic with valid supporting evidence, and to cogently synthesize and summarize the ideas in bibliographical sources and the results of their own analytical inquiry. xIncreased sensitivity and appreciation of cultural and linguistic differences. Potential Occupations Available career choices include, but are not limited to: bilingual educator; foreign language teacher; interpreter; receptionist; attendant exchange program coordinator, director, assistant; foreign correspondent; intelligence specialist; immigration and custom inspector; tourism specialist; attach\u00e9; librarian; bilingual work in social services.

DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY Office in Clark Building, Room B357 (970) 491-6334 http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Hist/histhome.html Professor Ruth Alexander, Chair Major in History History is an account of our human past and seeks to interpret the course of human affairs through evidence and reason. Historians use written records, images, artifacts, and other materials to understand the past and also the relationship between the past and the present. Historians ask not only what happened and why, but also how the present came to be. History provides insights into how individuals and groups made decisions, exercised power, and responded to change. History helps us to understand how processes - such as revolution, migration, war, ecological disturbance, and globalization - shaped societies over time. It helps us to understand how people grappled with class, ethnicity, gender, and race, and how the conceptualized the world through religion and ideology. History provides a form of knowledge that people in all times and places have used to answer basic questions about the human predicament. The history major is designed for students to enlarge their knowledge about the past, improve their ability to think logically and critically, and sharpen their powers of written and oral expression. Learning Outcomes Students will demonstrate: xAbility to analyze and interpret historical materials, such as documents, artifacts, and images; xAbility to engage in chronological reasoning, to understand causation and change over time; xAbility to examine critically how people in the past understood their own history, in scholarly works and in popular forms such as myths or commemorations; xAbility to interpret, write, and speak about the past using evidence and according to the standards and expectations of the historical discipline. Potential Occupations xGovernment official in foreign service, national security, military, cultural resources management, and other areas. xHistory teacher in public and private schools. xWith additional graduate training: lawyer, physician, social worker, minister, librarian, museum curator, archivist, professor, educational administrator, or other professional. xAny professional occupation in business or public service requiring a liberal arts education and skills in research, writing, and the analysis of information. Liberal Arts Concentration The liberal arts concentration is an excellent major for students planning careers in history, government service, and other professional occupations requiring broad intellectual and practical skills.

College of Liberal Arts 224DEPARTMENT OF JOURNALISM AND TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION Office in Clark Building, Room C225 (970) 491-6310 www.colostate.edu/Depts/TJ Professor Garrett J. O'Keefe, Chair Professor Greg Luft, Undergraduate Coordinator Professor Don Zimmerman, Graduate Coordinator Major in Technical Journalism The study of journalism and mass communication combines high-level professional training with a broad foundation in the liberal arts. Students complete a 15-credit core in one of five concentrations and 6-9 credits of mass media and society courses. Students may also complete a professionally-administered media internship program. Additional practical experience can be gained on the staffs of the daily Rocky Mountain Collegian, the award-winning campus television station CTV, and KCSU Radio. Graduating seniors present professional portfolios for assessment by panels of faculty and communication professionals from Denver and elsewhere in Colorado. Because successful communicators require broad knowledge, this flexible program encouraged development of a background in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and in-depth study in an area of interest outside journalism. The addition of a minor or double major in disciplines such as political science, economics, business, speech communication, psychology, or natural or applied sciences is possible. The Department of Journalism and Technical Communication is one of a relatively small number of departments recognized nationally by the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications. Concentrations are offered in computer-mediated communication; news-editorial; public relations; specialized communication; and television news and video communication. Participation in internships, volunteer activities, or cooperative education opportunities is highly recommended to enhance practical training and development. Learning Outcomes Students will demonstrate: xCompetence in writing, editing, and producing media messages as well as in planning, designing and evaluating effective public information programs. xKnowledge and use of communication theory and research principles to guide the selection of communication audiences, message content and format, and media channels to enhance communication impact. xUnderstanding of the ethics, laws , and values associated with professional communication activity Potential Occupations The technical journalism program emphasizes the role of mass media in society and prepares students for entry-level work in a variety of capacities in private business, government, and education. Depending upon the concentration chosen, students may enter print and broadcast news media, public relations and marketing departments in private businesses and public institutions, publications firms and agencies oriented toward specialized audiences, and a variety of professional positions related to news video and computer-based communication. Some career opportunities include, but are not limited to: news reporter/editor; publication editor; media specialist; video producer/editor; fund-raising specialist; columnist; communications officer or program director.

Our primary goal is to prepare students to become highly skilled music educators, music therapists, performers, composers, and conductors. Program goals encourage and develop high standards of teaching, scholarship, performance, and research in music. We are pleased to offer small academic classes, applied study with highly qualified faculty, and careful attention to advising. Courses in music appreciation, music theory fundamentals, and ensembles are open to all students regardless of major. Learning Outcomes Students will demonstrate: xAbility to perform music from a variety of historical/ style periods, and exhibit the appropriate skills for musical self-expression in juried performances. These skills include: techniques, musicianship, tone, diction/articulation, style, interpretation, and artistry. xUnderstanding of the common elements and organizational patterns of music, including musical forms, processes, and structures. xKnowledge of music history and representative composers and works from each on a defined evaluation instrument. Music majors are expected to pass comprehensive examinations in music history and theory upon completion of course sequences in those areas. Students are also expected to learn music literature from all periods through aural and score analysis. Performance skills are tested at the end of the sophomore year and in a graduation recital if required by the degree option. Some programs require satisfactory completion of supervised student teaching, an internship, or a senior project. In addition, all students must pass a piano proficiency examination. Potential Occupations The undergraduate music curricula at Colorado State University can lead to personally fulfilling careers as music educators, music therapists, performers, composers, and conductors. Music graduates from Colorado State have successfully gained employment in public and private schools, hospitals and institutions, and as professional performers, conductors, and composers. Composition Concentration The composition concentration is designed to prepare the student to compose original music for a wide variety of venues including live concerts, music to accompany film, video, dance, and theatre.

Theatre Concentration Office in Johnson Hall, Room 220 (970) 491-5562 Associate Professor Laura Jones, DirectorThe theatre concentration consists of classroom and laboratory study as well as practical experience with productions of the experimental and main stages. Consistent with the program's generalist philosophy, students are required to take courses in all of the basic theatrical disciplines. Core courses are required in acting, graphic expression and design, technical theatre, directing, costume and makeup, and history of theatre. Courses in art, music, or dance are required, depending on your interests. Senior students are required to do a special project in an area of personal interest. Projects include directing a full-length play, designing or lighting a main stage production, presenting an acting recital, or writing a major research paper. An exciting new prospect for the pursuit of a degree in the performing arts at Colorado State is the commitment to build the University Center for the Arts. This state-of-the-art facility will create a vibrant learning environment and showcase of the performing and creative arts and will significantly enhance the current classrooms, studios, and performance venues in music, theatre, dance, and the visual arts.

College of Liberal Arts 235The theatre program produces a six-show academic season and multiple student-produced projects. Among the practical experience opportunities for students are the improv team, a CAD lab featuring integrated computer visualization technology, and the unique Summer Outdoor Caf\u00e9 Theatre. Creative and Performing Arts Awards are available for talented and qualified students. Theatre also offers minors in acting/directing and design/technical theatre in order to give students in related majors the opportunity to formalize their interest in theatre. These minors offer an opportunity for concentrated study in at least one of the basic theatre crafts as well as a background in general theatre practice and history. Potential Occupations Talent and training are the main factors for success in acting. A pleasing voice, good diction, physical attractiveness, imagination, charm and ability to understand people are also valued. Earning a living solely by working in the performing arts is rare. Most artists also depend upon other arts-related jobs or second careers. For many, success is based on creative work rather than on money and status. Theatre and dance majors often select a second major such as business or education to enhance their job prospects. Experience acquired through extracurricular performances or internships is highly recommended to enhance practical training and development. Students who go on for advanced study at the graduate level can obtain more responsible positions. Possible career opportunities include, but are not limited to: electrician; stage manager; props manager; producer; musical director. Students selecting a concentration in theatre should contact the Director of the Program in Theatre, 220 Johnson Hall, for additional information.

It is the study of the most basic moral, legal, aesthetic, religious, and metaphysical ideas by which we quest for understanding and develop principles of conduct. Philosophers seek to establish standards of evidence, provide rational methods of resolving conflicts, establish criteria for a just social order, and create techniques for evaluating ideas and arguments. The study of philosophy broadens and intensifies liberal education while enhancing interpretive abilities in many fields. The curriculum encourages a broad liberal arts background, including courses in foreign languages and a plan for graduate school and teaching careers in philosophy. The broad relevance of philosophy to other fields permits most students to work toward goals such as professional training in law, medicine, business, or the ministry. There are three concentrations available to philosophy majors: general philosophy, philosophy and religion, and philosophy, science, and technology. It is not unusual for philosophy majors to also major in other disciplines, and these concentrations combine easily with other majors in the University.Learning Outcomes Philosophy students will: xRecognize and analyze arguments; reconstruct arguments from major texts in both the history of philosophy and in significant contemporary philosophical work; evaluate these arguments for the validity of argument structures and the truth of premises (soundness); and construct valid and sound arguments of their own in a fashion that is as clear and concise as possible. xDemonstrate in their senior year knowledge of major historical figures in their most significant works as well as significant current issues from the major sub-disciplines of philosophy, particularly ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology. xDemonstrate in their senior year skills in oral presentation, engaging in fruitful oral discussion, debate, and formal presentations that are logically cohe4rent, clearly and concisely stated, and accessible to their peers in philosophy. Potential Occupations A major in philosophy prepares students for a wide variety of professional goals including graduate school in philosophy or other disciplines, training in law, computer technology, social work, health care, the ministry, business, and general intellectual flexibility in a changing world. Participating in internships and cooperative education opportunities is highly recommended to enhance practical training and development. The high level of skill philosophy majors acquire in communication, analytical and critical thinking enables them to secure jobs in a variety of private and public sector professions. Depending on the concentration selected, available career opportunities include, but are not limited to: public policy analyst; business manager; pbulsihers; ethics consultant in a variety of fields, e.g. medicine, engineering, and the sciences. Students are required to receive at least a C- (1.67) in each philosophy course required for the major or minor in philosophy. The minimum scholastic average acceptable for graduation is 2.00 computed only for courses attempted at Colorado State.

College of Liberal Arts 241Graduate Programs in Political Science The department offers graduate programs in political science leading to the master of arts and doctor of philosophy degrees. A full description of these programs may be found in the Graduate and Professional Bulletin . DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY Office in Clark Building, Room B258 (970) 491-6045 http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Sociology/ Professor Louis E. Swanson, Jr., Chair Associate Professor Mike Lacy, Director of Graduate Studies Associate Professor John Brouillette, Director of Undergraduate Studies Major in Sociology Sociology is the study of social life, focusing on the mutual interaction between human groups and institutions. Human beings, through patterned social interactions, construct and reconstruct the social webs within which they live. The nature and type of social relationships are central to their lives. Sociologists study relationships within family units from the most primitive cultures to interactions of large, bureaucratic institutions in major industrialized nations. Social issues are studied in a variety of ways: direct observation of groups; surveying or interviewing individuals; analyzing historical research; and a variety of other methods. Sociology majors have many opportunities to pursue broad and diverse ranges of interest. Students gain a sense of social perspective, an understanding of human affairs, an ability to think critically, and a capacity to write well. The curriculum includes general courses in the arts and humanities and the social sciences along with sociology course work. A generous selection of electives allows students to major or minor in a complementary discipline. A sociology major also may attain certification in one of the interdisciplinary study programs such as Asian studies, Latin American studies, religious studies, or Russian, Eastern and Central European studies. Learning Outcomes Students will: xCritically analyze the major classical and contemporary theories from the 19th and 20th centuries. Students are expected to demonstrate how well these theories help us understand or explain current social phenomena both in the U.S. and abroad. Students will learn to apply a wide variety of theories, including European critical theory, functionalism, symbolic interactionism, and post-modern theory, in required empirical research. xCritically analyze sociological phenomena by applying objective social research methodologies. Students will demonstrate a working knowledge of sociological theories and the application of theses theories to real world social phenomena. Specifically, students will understand conceptual frameworks associated with 1) social structure (social stratification, ethnic structures, social institutions, small group dynamics, social demography, and social organizations); 2) culture (socialization and the development of personalities, social norms, framing normative assumptions of societies and organizations); and 3) social agency (the behavior of the individual, collective behavior such as with social movements, and the principles of social-psychology). xCritically analyze sociological phenomena by applying social statistical techniques. Students will demonstrate a strong working knowledge of statistical techniques including 1) parametric statistics, 2) non-parametric statistics, 3) ordinary least squares statistical analysis, and 4) the application of the SPSS statistical package. Potential Occupations Careers are exceptionally varied. Participating in internships and cooperative education opportunities is highly recommended to enhance your practical training and development. Sociology graduates apply their education to a large variety of occupations in the non-profit, private, and public sectors. Because sociology graduates possess a number of transferable communication, analytical, and people skills, they find positions in government, industry, and academia. Many employers appreciate liberal arts majors for their multiple skills and their ability to adapt to a variety of tasks and work environments. Graduates who go on for advanced studies can pursue careers in sociology or attain advanced positions with the possibility of rising to top professional levels. Depending on student interests, the electives taken, or the concentration selected, available career choices include, but are not limited to: business manager; personnel director; city Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

College of Liberal Arts 244DEPARTMENT OF SPEECH COMMUNICATION Office in Eddy Hall, Room 202 (970) 491-6140 www.colostate.edu/Depts/Speech/ Professor Denny Phillips, Chair Major in Speech Communication Speech communication majors receive a broad-based liberal arts education, designed to equip them for the challenges of the 21 st century, including the likelihood of more than one career and the need to adapt to a rapidly changing workplace. The major encompasses many facets of oral, electronic, and computer-mediated communication. Along with courses in speech communication, the major requires courses in history and electives in the arts and humanities and the social sciences. The department's goals for undergraduate majors include helping students to achieve an outstanding education in communication studies, to further their knowledge and understanding of human communications, and to provide leadership in communication activities. In so doing, we hope to help students prepare for successful careers, the duties of citizenship, and productive and rewarding lives. Within the major of speech communication are four concentrations - communication studies, media studies, rhetorical studies, and teacher licensure. Learning Outcomes Students will demonstrate: xBreadth of knowledge within the discipline including but not limited to history, theory, criticism, and application of pragmatic principles of human communication in a variety of settings and media xDepth of knowledge within the discipline conducive to extended oral presentation in public, business, and professional settings that include principles of selecting a topic, planning the presentation, analyzing audiences, developing speaker credibility, carrying out research, organizing the material into logically sound component parts, offering emotional appeals, and delivering the presentation in a way that develops and maintains attention while enhancing the content. xDepth of knowledge within the discipline through excellence in written communication that includes the abilities to: 1) write critically and analytically, 2) structure a persuasive argument, 3) research thoroughly, 4) document sources accurately and in appropriate fashion, and 5) write at a professional level within the discipline.Potential Occupations The speech communication major, like many liberal arts majors, provides students with a broad academic background suitable for a variety of jobs in the public and private sectors. Speech communication majors are trained to think independently and critically, communicate effectively, and function in a multicultural world. Many majors find employment in public relations, politics, sales, advertising, video production, radio, television, cable, government, sports information, business management, promotions, and education. Recently, some majors have entered and even created careers in computer-mediated communication. Some students move on to graduate work in speech communication and broadcasting, for teaching at various levels; and for post-graduate study in law and theology. Many employers appreciate liberal arts majors for their multiple skills and their ability to adapt to a variety of tasks and work environments. Careers for graduates are available in education, business, and government. Internships are available to speech communication majors and highly recommended to enhance practical training and development. Graduates who seek advanced studies can attain more responsible positions with the possibility of rising to top professional levels. Career opportunities include, but are not limited to: program manager; production manager; associate director; television schedule operator; operator; audio-visual production specialist; contact representative; employee relations specialist; employment or guidance counselor; human resource adviser; industrial relations representative; public relations specialist; communicator; equal opportunity representative; communications equipment representative; lyricist; Course Title (Prerequisite) Cr AUCC FRESHMAN COCC 150 College Composition (Composition Placement Exam score of 3-6 or CO 130) 3 1A POCC 101 American Government and Politics 3 3C, 3F SPCC 100 Communications and Popular Culture 3 3B 200 Public Speaking 3 2A1 Biological/physical sciences1 7 3A Health and welnness2 2 3G Historical perspectives3 3 3D Mathematics4 3 1B Elective 3 TOTAL 30 SOPHOMORE SPCC 201 Rhetoric in Western Thought 3 3B SPCC 207 Rhetoric and Argumentation 3 2B Global and cultural awareness 53 3E Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

Dennis Child, Associate Dean UNDERGRADUATE MAJORS Fishery Biology ForestryGeologyNatural Resource Recreation and Tourism Natural Resources Management Rangeland Ecology Watershed Science Wildlife Biology UNDERGRADUATE MINORS Fishery Biology ForestryGeologyRange Ecology Spatial Information Management Watershed Science Wilderness Management The College offers studies and professional training in the management, administration, and scientific investigation of renewable and nonrenewable natural resources. Programs include the study of every component of natural systems with particular emphasis on fish, forests, minerals, range, watershed, wildlife, and outdoor recreation areas. The Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory, housed in the College, is devoted to research and training in ecosystem science and management. COLLEGE PROGRAMS Undergraduate Majors The scope of the College's programs is more broadly based than most natural resources schools. There are eight undergraduate curricula, most with specialized concentrations or designated areas of further study. Undergraduate majors in all four departments lead to the bachelor of science degree, which requires a minimum of 120 credits. A minimum of 42 credits in upper division courses is required for all majors. Environmental Studies Open Option Office in Natural Resource Building, Room 103 Students who have a strong interest and aptitude in the broad area of natural resources, but who have not decided on a specific major, may enroll in the Environmental Studies Open Option. This option extends through the two semesters of the freshman year. Selection of a major must be made prior to the beginning of the sophomore year. Field Training Programs Most undergraduate majors require the completion of a four-week summer field training program (five credits) before their junior year. Summer field instruction is given at the Pingree Park campus, 55 miles west of Fort Collins. Permanent quarters and meals are provided. Information concerning the summer program is available in February from the Dean's Office of the College of Natural Resources. During interim or summer periods, some majors devote several weeks to advanced field training programs off campus. Students taking advanced ROTC should arrange their schedules with their advisers in their junior year to avoid conflicts during senior spring semester. It is recommended for all majors, and required for some, that students have a minimum of one summer of field experience before graduation. International Education International resources management is an increasingly important concern of the College of Natural Resources. It is desirable that students in the College have opportunities to study abroad, just as students from abroad are encouraged to study here. The University has agreements covering study abroad opportunities with institutions throughout the world. Students may complete one or two semesters of resources management education abroad. Students interested in study abroad should plan, far in advance, by discussing opportunities with their academic adviser and by visiting the Office of International Programs in Laurel Hall, www.international.colostate.edu/us/studyabroad .

College of Natural Resources 249Graduate Programs Master of science and doctor of philosophy degree programs are offered in each department. Programs leading to the professional degree, master of forestry, are offered in the Department of Forest, Rangeland, and Watershed Stewardship. A description of these programs may be found in the Graduate and Professional Bulletin . ADMISSION INFORMATION For High School Graduates High school students are advised to take all the English, science, and mathematics courses possible to prepare for college-level work in natural resources. Limitation on Transfer of Credits Students planning to attend another college or junior college prior to enrolling at Colorado State University should follow the freshman program for their chosen major as closely as possible. To assure that they have the opportunity to complete all degree requirements in four years, they should plan to transfer to Colorado State no later than the beginning of their junior year. Students whose majors include the summer field training program should transfer for the summer session prior to their junior year. Credits which transfer but are not equivalent to specific curriculum requirements may be used as elective credits. Transfer Students Students are required to choose a major when enrolling. Transfer students, therefore, should follow the departmental curriculum closely. Check the individual major and concentration for specific courses. DEPARTMENT OF FISHERY AND WILDLIFE BIOLOGY Office in Wagar Building, Room 136 (970) 491-5020 http://www.cnr.colostate.edu/FWB/ Professor H. Randall Robinette, HeadTwo majors are offered for careers in fish or wildlife biology, management, conservation, administration, or research. Fish and wildlife are interpreted broadly to include all wild vertebrate animals. Emphasis is given to fish and wildlife in integrated resource management, to applications of technology, and to socioeconomic considerations. Major in Fishery Biology Associate Professor Brett Johnson, in charge A fishery biology degree prepares students for careers in fish biology, fish management, aquaculture, or aquatic ecology, fishery research, or graduate studies. The fishery biology program at Colorado State University is a nationally ranked program located in an ideal setting for the study of fisheries and resource management issues. The faculty is wide ranging in expertise, and innovative in teaching and research methods. A variety of specializations is possible including aquaculture, fisheries management, aquatic ecology, and fish biology. Students also have access to a wide array of facilities, research and internship opportunities, and professional associations to further their studies, practical experience, and career potential. The fishery biology curriculum provides a solid foundation in the natural sciences, plus specific requirements in organismal and suborganismal biology, aquatic ecology, fishery biology, and ecosystem management. Additionally, up to 25 elective credits can be used to develop expertise in one of several specialties. Aquaculture, the propagation of fish, emphasizes fish culture, genetics, fish physiology, nutrition, microbiology, engineering, and water quality. Fisheries management includes electives in aquatic ecology, watershed science, computer modeling, natural resources policy, and public relations. Those interested in aquatic ecology or fish biology should select electives to obtain a broad background in math, chemistry, physics, and upper-division biology courses.

Binkley and Ingrid C. Burke, in charge The goal of the natural resources management major is to provide students with a broad-based understanding of the use and management of natural resources. Specific objectives are to provide each student with: 1) a science-based core curriculum in biological, physical, and social sciences; 2) a broad foundation in natural resources science and management; and 3) specialization in a subject relevant to natural resources management. The breadth of the major allows students to specialize in a wide range of topics, including conservation biology, geographic information systems, forest management, rangeland ecology, natural resource policy, recreation resources, watershed management, wildlife management, or other topics related to natural resources management. The first year, students are expected to complete most of the undergraduate core curriculum as well as courses in biology, chemistry, and mathematics. The second year, students develop the initial foundation in natural resources through courses in ecology, ecogeography, geology, microeconomics, soils, and statistics. Field measurements and field skills are important components of this major, and students are required to attend a 4-week summer field course in ecological investigations and resource management. The beginning of the third year, students must declare a minor. Required courses in the third year complete much of the core curriculum in the different disciplines that make up the major; these include courses in natural resources policy, forest ecology, vegetation management, remote sensing and geographic information systems, and technical writing. The fourth year, students are required to complete their minor and take the final set of courses in public relations, natural resource sampling, and the capstone course in integrated ecosystem management. Students are encouraged to participate in internships and obtain related work experience. At the completion of the program, students should have the technical and communication skills that are critical in resolving important natural resource management problems. Learning Outcomes Students will: xAccurately communicate their knowledge of natural resources, both verbally and in written form. xDemonstrate learning of subject areas outside their major study focus, including but not restricted to principles/issues in wildlife, water, recreation, wilderness, soil, range, and fishery resources; students Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

Major in Rangeland Ecology Professor Wayne C. Leininger, in charge The major in rangeland ecology emphasizes interdisciplinary study of, and research on, the world's rangelands. Rangelands occupy nearly 50 percent of the earth's land surface and consist of natural grasslands, savannas, shrublands, riparian areas, deserts, tundra, alpine communities, and coastal marshes. Colorado is an ideal setting for the study of rangeland ecology and management with shortgrass prairie to the east and high elevation grasslands and riparian areas to the west. Students are prepared to manage the animal, soil, and vegetation resources on rangelands primarily for state and federal land management agencies. The curricula are accredited by the Society for Range Management and meet U.S. Civil Service requirements for range conservationist and soil conservationist. With a few additional courses, graduates can meet U.S. Civil Service requirements for soil scientist and ecologist. Students develop an in-depth understanding of basic plant and animal biology; a basic understanding of the physical sciences as they relate to rangeland ecology; knowledge of important concepts of ecology and range management; an understanding of economics related to recognizing alternatives; and analytical and decision making skills. Students also develop communication, political and interpersonal skills to make their education effective. Four concentrations are offered - range and forest management; rangeland management; restoration ecology; and science. Learning Outcomes Students will: xAccurately and effectively communicate their understanding of rangeland ecology both verbally and in written form. xDemonstrate learning of subject areas outside their major study focus, including (but not restricted to) principles/issues in wildlife, water, recreation, wilderness, soil, range, and fishery resources; students will also demonstrate knowledge of social science analytic techniques. xDemonstrate comprehensive knowledge of subject areas relevant to the major fields of study in range ecology and management, including plant/animal interactions, grazing methods, range improvements, animal nutrition, plant ecology, and soil science, and apply this knowledge in a complex, problem-solving environment. Potential Occupations Rangeland scientists are trained to manage lands that produce herbage for all grazing animals, for aesthetic values, and for watershed enhancement. Knowledgeable in ecosystem structure, rangeland scientists possess an understanding of the functions of the ecosystem with respect to nutrient cycling, energy flows among feeding levels, and animal requirements for food and shelter. These scientists are also trained to assess rehabilitation potential following drastic disturbances and to develop procedures for land reclamation and management. Rangeland scientists often work closely with other specialists in wildlife, hydrology, forestry, soils, agronomy, recreation, and other disciplines. Rangelands occupy nearly one-half of the world's land surface, and employment opportunities for graduates in this major are diverse and excellent. The profession offers an opportunity to work full time with natural resources, the improvement of environmental quality, and the basic problems for ecology. Because of growing interest in all aspects of the environment, the demand for additional rangeland scientists is expected to increase by 33 percent in the next decade. In the U.S., most rangeland scientists work for federal and state governments; while private industry, colleges and universities, and international agencies are increasing employing rangeland scientists. Participation in internships, volunteer activities, or cooperative education opportunities is highly recommended to enhance practical training and development. Graduates who go on for advanced studies can attain more responsible positions with the possibility of rising to top professional levels. Examples of career opportunities include, but are not limited to: restoration ecologist; rangeland rehabilitation specialist; real estate/land manger; international rangeland specialist. Range and Forest Management Concentration Range and forest management prepares students in multiple-use principles to manage and administer both rangeland and forest resources for federal and state government agencies or private business. M CC 120A-B and M CC 121 are considered review courses, credits in these courses may not be used toward the degree in rangeland ecology.

Major in Watershed Science Professor John D. Stednick, in charge In Colorado, and many other localities around the world, the management and allocation of fresh water resources rank among the most important political and development issues. All civilizations throughout history, including our own, have always been vitally dependent upon the availability of uncontaminated ground water. Watershed science is the interdisciplinary study of the natural processes of human activities that affect water resources on a basin or catchment scale. The program requires a solid grounding in the physical and natural sciences in preparation for the upper-division courses in topics such as land use hydrology, land use and water quality, eolian and fluvial transport processes, and watershed analysis. Learning Outcomes Students will demonstrate: xUnderstanding of the key concepts in watershed science, a familiarity and understanding of commonly-used models, and an ability to analyze complex data. Demonstrations include the following: 1) knowledge of surface water hydrology, including the ability to quantify a design storm, development of a water balance, and use of runoff prediction tools; 2) knowledge of erosion processes and sediment pool design; 3) knowledge and use of conceptual, empirical, and physically-based models; and 4) demonstrate an ability to collect, analyze, and assess the validity of complex data. xAbility to individually write a comprehensive technical report. xAbility to orally present the results of their work within the capstone and display the following skills: 1) organization of the presentation, including the ability to Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

In this role the College serves Colorado State's broad liberal and general education objectives. COLLEGE PROGRAMS Undergraduate Majors The College's 8 departments offer 9 undergraduate majors, all leading to a bachelor of science degree which requires a minimum of 120 credits with a minimum of 42 credits in upper-division courses. Preparation for the Health Professions Special advisers assist students in planning for entrance into accredited colleges of dentistry and dental hygiene, human medicine and osteopathy, nursing, optometry, pharmacy, physical therapy, physician assistant, podiatry, chiropractic, and other health professions. Since the advisers are acquainted with University courses and requirements of the professional schools, they can help students fulfill requirements, plan for alternate but related careers, and make the most of their total undergraduate experience. Students entering a health preprofessional program must declare a formal academic major and be assigned an appropriate adviser. No preprofessional program is a major in itself. The major may be in any college and should be chosen with the student's educational and alternative vocational objectives in mind. Students planning to enter a health field may make initial inquiry at the Center for Advising and Student Achievement (CASA), northeast wing of Aylesworth Hall. Freshman Open Option Office in Statistics Building, Room 117 Students who have not decided on a major but whose interests, aptitudes, and high school academic preparation in mathematics and the natural sciences clearly point to a major in this college may enroll as Natural Sciences Open Option. This option extends through the two semesters of the freshman year. Students may declare a departmental or interdepartmental major any time during their freshman year and are required to do so at the beginning of their sophomore year. Courses that should be taken by Natural Sciences Open Option students are mathematics, one or two basic science courses (chemistry, biology, physics), arts and humanities courses, behavioral and social sciences courses, and COCC 150. If biology is chosen as one of the science courses, it is strongly recommended that general chemistry also be taken.

INTERDEPARTMENTAL MAJOR Major in Natural Sciences The bachelor of science in natural sciences meets the needs of two audiences: xStudents who want to become high school or junior high/middle school science teachers; xStudents who want a broad exposure to mathematics and the physical sciences, rather than specialization in one discipline. Learning Outcomes Students will demonstrate: xSkills to critically interpret scientific data. xLogical and critical thinking. xAnalysis and solving of complex problems. xStrong written and oral communication skills. Potential Occupations Graduates with licensure in secondary science education will find a strong demand for high school and junior high/ middle school teachers in Colorado and elsewhere in the nation. In addition, these graduates will also have the background required for graduate science education programs. With proper planning, physical science graduate can meet requirements for professional schools (e.g., medicine or law) or graduate programs in the basic or applied sciences. Internships and volunteer activities can provide practical training and experience. Recent graduates have found employment as: technical writers; atmospheric scientists; computer sales representatives; crime laboratory analysts; patent examiners; quality control technicians. Secondary Education The bachelor of science in natural sciences degree provides the subject matter, the education classes, and the classroom experience required for secondary education licensure in Colorado. Concentrations in the natural sciences major include: biology education, biology/natural resource education; chemistry education; general science education; geology education; and physics education. The program includes science courses in a concentration such as biology, geology, physics, chemistry, etc.; and All-University Core Curriculum; and professional classes in the School of Education (SOE). In addition, the SOE helps schedule classroom visits and practica. The experience culminates in a semester of student teaching under the supervision of a master teacher.

Physical Science Concentration The physical science concentration begins with two semesters each of calculus, chemistry, and physics, plus a semester of biological science. Students then complete the major by earning two minors selected from biochemistry, chemistry, computer science, geology, mathematics, or physics. Completion of the double minor gives an unusual breadth in the physical sciences. Recent graduates have pursued careers in science. Others use this background as a basis for graduate work and research or for entry into medical or veterinary professional programs. Graduates can also add the certification requirements for secondary education to this concentration.

Biochemistry is most simply defined as the chemistry of living systems. It is the science that tries to explain how \"lifeless\" molecules work together to make \"living\" organisms. The methods of chemistry and molecular biology are used to study the structure and behavior of the complex molecules found in biological materials and the ways these molecules interact to form cells, tissues, and whole organisms. Biochemistry provides the basis for advances in human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. Biochemists may participate in interdisciplinary research and development projects alongside chemical engineers, biologists, microbiologists, agronomists, physicians, and other professionals. They investigate the molecular mechanisms of such diseases as Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

The biochemistry major provides a student with a strong, well-balanced background in the biological, physical, and mathematical sciences. As a biochemistry major, studies include macromolecular structure and function; cellular biochemistry; metabolism; gene expression, structure, replication, and repair; cell organization, communication, growth, aging, and death. Students are also required to take courses in physics, organic chemistry, physical chemistry for life sciences, and statistical measurements and methods used in research. Independent study, internships, and advanced research-oriented laboratory classes during the junior and senior years provide opportunities for experiential learning and working closely with the faculty. Learning Outcomes Students will: xDemonstrate a command of the basic concepts of chemistry, biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology. xCritically analyze, and present the methods, results, and conclusions of scientific papers in the current biochemical literature, and orally present technical material in a clear and comprehensible form. xUse a variety of laboratory techniques; critically interpret experimental results; and design new experiments. xDemonstrate the ability to perform original research in biochemistry and molecular biology. Potential Occupations Possible career opportunities include, but are not limited to: process research technician; production/quality assurance technician; teacher; writer; fisheries biologist; research analyst; clinical technologist. M CC 120A-B, M CC 121, M CC 124, M CC 125, and M CC 126 are considered review courses; credit in these courses, either by examination or completion, may not be used toward a degree in biochemistry, i.e., they do not count toward the 120 credits re quired for graduation. A minimum overall grade point aver age of 2.0 must be earned for all required biochemistry, LS, and NS prefix lecture and laboratory courses. This minimum average includes the original grade for any repeated course.

DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY Office in Anatomy-Zoology Building, Room E106 (970) 491-7011 http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Biology Professor Daniel R. Bush, Chair Major in Biological Science Biology is the study of all living things - from bacteria and viruses that can be seen only under a microscope, to plants, animals, and humans and their relationship to their environments. Biology majors study the structure and function of cells, organ systems and tissues in animals and plants, ecology (the relationship between living things and their environment), and evolution. They learn about physiology, behavior, genetics and heredity, aquatic toxicology, microscopic organisms such as bacteria, and laboratory techniques for diverse areas ranging from field research to biotechnology. This major provides a solid foundation of understanding in the basic biological sciences. It also offers an opportunity to choose an area of emphasis within life sciences that is related to particular career goals. (For example, anatomy of cell and molecular biology for biomedical professions or biotechnology, aquatic biology for marine biologists, plant molecular biology for agricultural biotechnology, etc.) The curriculum includes a two-semester introductory biology sequence, cell biology, developmental biology, ecology, and genetics.

College of Natural Sciences 282chemistry, and at least one course in organic chemistry, physics, and one in biochemistry, including labs in each. A calculus course and a statistics course are also required. In addition, students choose a selected field of 12 credits on one of the following: anatomy/physiology, aquatic biology, behavioral biology, cellular/molecular and genetic biology, ecology, evolution/genetics and systematics, microbiology, or integrative organismal biology. There is an additional requirement of one course in two other fields, which assures a broad base of study. Learning Outcomes Students will: xInterpret scientific data xDemonstrated strong organizational and laboratory skills xDefine scientific hypotheses and design experiments to test them xWork effectively in groups xDemonstrate strong writing and oral communication skills Potential Occupations Training in biology prepares students for a very large number of occupations. Some involve daily interaction with dozens of people, others can be done in relative isolation; some are highly focused, others require knowledge far beyond science. Career options related to biology include water quality assessments, field and lab technician work, biotechnology in biomedical sciences and agriculture, genetic research, agriculture, or sales (i.e., pharmaceutical, agricultural). Graduates work in small business, multinational corporations, academia, and government research laboratories and policy agencies. A degree in biological sciences offers a broad foundation for dental, medical, or veterinary school, and a number of health professions such as podiatry or optometry. Graduates often pursue advanced degrees in life sciences to carry out basic research or advance into leadership positions in industry. Participation in internships and/or laboratory research experience is highly recommended and strongly encouraged by the department to enhance practical training and development. Combining biology with non-science skills can also lead to exciting careers. Biology and English can be incorporated into a career as a technical writer or science fiction novelist. Biology and art are combined in medical and scientific illustration. Biology and computer science can be linked in the exciting area of bioinformatics, or as an historian of science or medicine. Work in both biology and philosophy/ religion can be incorporated in careers in bioethics. Biology is linked with psychology for the neuroscientist or genetic counselor. Study biology and political science to work in environmental law or be a patent lawyer in biotechnology. Try mixing biology and business to get into hospital administration, small business or biotechnology administration. Specialized master's degrees are designed for many of these unique career paths. Some career opportunities include, but are not limited to: aquarium, zoo, and museum worker; assistant research scientist; research technician in industry or university laboratories; biology photographer; biotechnologist; brewery laboratory assistant; consumer product researcher; bacteriologist, biologist, or ecologist; nuclear medicine technician; park naturalist; pharmaceutical researcher or salesperson; public health officer; science librarian; environmental educator, health specialist, or impact specialist; ecologist; fisheries biologist or conservationist; industrial hygienist; occupational therapist (with a master's degree); medical or clinical laboratory technologist; Peace Corps volunteer. To be qualified for graduation, students in the biological science major must have a minimum grade of C- in each of their biological, physical science, and mathematical courses used to meet requirements for the major. This applies to courses taken as substitutions for meeting these requirements. The minimum scholastic average acceptable for graduation is 2.0 computed only for courses attempted at Colorado State. M CC 120, M CC 121, M CC 124, and M CC 125 are considered review courses; credits in these courses may not be used toward a degree in the majors in biological science or zoology.

Botany Concentration Botany is the general study of plants from microscopic algae to giant redwoods, from mushrooming fungi to flowering angiosperms. Plant anatomy, how plants grow and develop, and how they survive and interrelate within their environments are topics of study. For students who like the outdoors, a career in plant ecology, taxonomy, or forestry might be appealing. Students attracted to the beauty and design of the microscopic world might enjoy a career in plant anatomy or plant developmental biology. Those interested in chemistry might enjoy plant biochemistry, molecular biology, or plant biotechnology. Those intrigued by plant diseases might become plant pathologists and the mathematically oriented might explore systems ecology, genetics, or plant biotechnology. The botany curriculum begins with a solid foundation in mathematics, the biological sciences, chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, evolution, and genetics. Biochemistry, botany emphasizing terrestrial plant studies, including plant systematics, anatomy, and ecology, and earth sciences round out the core. Botany majors also take liberal arts and communications courses to give breadth to their education.

Graduate Programs in Computer Science Master of science and doctor of philosophy degree programs in computer science are offered emphasizing either theoretical or practical aspects of computer science. A description of theses programs may be found in the Graduate and Professional Bulletin . DEPARTMENTOF MATHEMATICS Office in Weber Building, Room 101 (970) 491-1303 http://www.math.colostate.edu Professor Simon Tavener, Chair Major in Mathematics Mathematics is the science of numbers, shapes, probabilities, and measurements. It is a universal language in which information is stated in the simplest possible form. Mathematics has a dual nature - it is an independent discipline valued for its precision and elegance, and it is an essential source of ideas and techniques for many, if not most, other scientific endeavors. The undergraduate program is structured to provide both a broad liberal arts education in mathematics, as well as a concentration in one of five focused areas. The liberal arts component requires students to acquire a broad background in communication skills, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. The major core focuses on developing students' understanding and appreciation of the mathematical sciences, their problem solving skills, and their ability to combine knowledge and skills in productive ways. Core mathematics subjects include three semesters of calculus, matrices and linear equations, advanced calculus of a single variable, abstract algebra, linear algebra, computer programming, and statistics. Seven concentrations are available in the program - actuarial science, applied mathematics, computational mathematics, general mathematics, mathematics education, mathematics of information, and statistics. Learning Outcomes Graduates will: xObtain a solid background in theoretical mathematics and will be able to participate in mathematical work in a variety of fields or continue on to graduate school. xBe able to apply a range of mathematical and statistical tools to a diverse set of problems as presented to them in either employment or in the pursuit of further education. xBe capable of describing their mathematical assumptions and results to colleagues. Potential Occupations The mathematics major prepares students for a wide variety of occupations in business, industry, government, and education. Although a national shortage of mathematics teachers no longer exists, our mathematics education graduates have been successful in finding positions. Actuarial science graduates who have passed the first two professional actuary exams can expect to find positions in large metropolitan areas with good entry-level salaries. Applied mathematics graduates continue to find employment opportunities in government and private industry. Many pursue advanced degrees in mathematics, computational science, or engineering. About one-third of general mathematics graduates continue on to graduate school in mathematics or other disciplines, with the rest finding employment in a large variety of capacities. Participation in internships, volunteer activities, or cooperative education opportunities is highly recommended to enhance practical training and development. Graduates who continue to pursue advanced degrees can attain more responsible positions with the possibility of rising to top professional levels. Career opportunities include, but are not limited to: applied mathematician; actuary; engineer; analyst; tax risk accountant; math educator.

Statistics Concentration Statistics provides the reasoning and the methods for producing and understanding data; it is the science of learning from data. It includes designing experiments or sampling surveys for the collection of data, collecting the information, evaluating it, drawing conclusions, and presenting the results. Statisticians work with people from other professional backgrounds to solve practical problems. Statisticians can provide crucial guidance in determining what information is reliable and which predictions can be trusted. This diversity of application is an exciting aspect of the field, and is one reason for continuing strong demand for well-trained statisticians.

DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS Office in Engineering Building, Room 124 (970) 491-6206 http://www.physics.colostate.edu/ Professor David A. Krueger, Chair Major in Physics Physics is the study of the structure and interaction of matter and energy. Physics has practical application to a wide variety of tasks such as predicting floods and earthquakes, developing energy sources, conserving water and soil, controlling smog, positioning communication satellites, and developing body-scanning devices. Physicists date fossils by using techniques to measure the radioactive decay of atoms. Physicists detect the existence of subatomic particles, measure the distances among stars and galaxies, and study the origin and destiny of the universe. The physics major begins with an emphasis on fundamentals in the basic sciences and mathematics to provide students with a broad foundation.

A description of these programs may be found in the Graduate and Professional Bulletin. DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY Office in Clark Building, Room B219 (970) 491-6364 http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Psychology Professor Ernest L. Chavez, Chair Major in Psychology Psychology is one of the most popular and versatile majors providing a preprofessional education in the social science tradition. The major emphasizes a strong background in the natural sciences, including mathematics, biology, chemistry, and human anatomy, and the arts, humanities, and social sciences including anthropology, sociology, philosophy, technical writing, and history. A large complement of electives enables students to take a second major or minor in a field of interest and orient toward one or a combination of four goals: 1) students can use a psychology degree as a background for careers outside psychology, with electives providing instruction in particular fields of interest; 2) a psychology degree can lead to careers in business, industry, government, education, and professions such as law and medicine; 3) students can graduate with a combination of courses and experiences to qualify for semiprofessional jobs in psychological settings or closely related fields; and 4) students can graduate with qualifications for entry into graduate study in psychology. Graduate programs offer general training followed by specialization. Advanced degrees are a prerequisite for professional careers in psychology. Learning Outcomes Students will: xDemonstrate understanding of the basic theories, principles, and laws of human and animal behavior with a substantial emphasis on psychological methods, measurement, and testing. xDemonstrate knowledge of psychological principles and concepts across several basic content areas. xEngage in analytical and critical thinking, and to demonstrate knowledge and appreciation of the scientific methods used in psychological research. Potential Occupations A B.S. degree in psychology prepares students for an exceptional variety of career options. Because of the strong liberal arts and sciences orientation, students develop a number of important skills required in a broad range of occupations. Many opportunities exist for graduates with a bachelor degree in psychology, including working in mental health and other human service fields; or as a background for careers in law enforcement or positions in industry, public service, business, government, and other professions. Skills such as written and oral communication, cooperation, analytical and critical thinking, plus a strong background in the liberal arts and sciences demonstrate versatility and an ability to pursue a variety of career paths. Participating in paid or voluntary work, internships, and cooperative education opportunities is highly recommended, as it will enhance a student's chance for employment. Possible career opportunities include, but are not limited to: human services worker; case worker; mental health services worker; probation officer; community relations officer; educator; occupational therapist (with advanced degree); program developer/administrator; human resources administrator; labor relations representative; compensation and benefits administrator; public relations specialist/special events administrator; advertising producer/writer; account services media program business manager; buying agent; sales representative; real estate broker; lawyer (with advanced degree); physician (with advanced degree).

The four-year professional veterinary medical program leads to the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree; students in this program typically complete a baccalaureate degree as part of their preparation. Graduate studies in each of the four departments of the college lead to master of science and doctor of philosophy degrees. Biomedical Sciences Open Option Biomedical Sciences Open Option is a program offered by the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences for students who are in their first two years of undergraduate work at Colorado State. The program is especially designed for students who have an interest in a career or advanced studies in any of a number of fields which require training in biomedical sciences and who have not made a specific choice of major for the bachelor's degree. Open option allows students to explore programs and majors in the College by fulfilling course work requirements common to environmental health and microbiology degree programs as well as the preveterinary medicine requirements. After completion of the open option curriculum, or at any time during the course of study, students will select a major leading to the bachelor's degree. Those who select the environmental health or microbiology majors can complete degree requirements in two additional years, as described by the departments. The program also prepares students for most other majors in biological sciences. Upon completion of one of the College's baccalaureate degree programs, students are prepared to enter a career directly or to continue graduate studies in biomedical sciences or professional studies in veterinary medical, medical, or dental schools. Students who intend to apply to veterinary school may complete all Colorado State pre-veterinary requirements within the open option program with appropriate course selection and credit loads in consultation with the Biomedical Sciences Open Option adviser. Study Abroad Study abroad programs are available to students in the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. Because the knowledge of at least one other culture is valuable in understanding our own, students are strongly encouraged to take a semester or longer to study outside the United States as part of their overall program. Students interested in study abroad should plan far in advance by discussing opportunities with their academic adviser and by Copyright & Disclaimer Information: Copyright \u00a9 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.

College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences 304visiting the Office of International Programs in Laurel Hall, www.international.colostate.edu/us/studyabroad . Continuing Education The College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences supports the veterinary profession by offering continuing education courses that enable practicing veterinarians to obtain new medical information and meet the Colorado Veterinary Practice Act's continuing education requirements for relicensure. The College shares responsibility for continuing education and maintains close liaison with the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), the Colorado Veterinary Medical Association (CVMA), the Colorado Board of Veterinary Medicine, and the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE). Graduate Programs Programs leading to the master of science and doctor of philosophy degrees are offered in all departments of the College. Students with bachelor of science or doctor of veterinary medicine degrees or well-qualified students who are currently pursuing veterinary medicine degrees, are eligible to study for advanced degrees in the Departments of Biomedical Sciences; Clinical Sciences; Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences; and Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology. The College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences (CVMBS) and the College of Business have created a combined five-year program of study that can result in earning both the master of business administration degree and doctor of veterinary medicine degree. Applicants to the Professional Veterinary Medical (PVM) program are encouraged to consider extending their veterinary education to include a one-year start to an M.B.A. degree. After successfully completing the first year of the M.B.A. program, students will be guaranteed admission to the first year of the PVM program and will be expected to complete the remaining M.B.A. course requirements concurrently with the first tow years of the PVM curriculum. A recent national study of the veterinary profession indicated that traditional scientific skills and knowledge might not be sufficient to capitalize on future economic opportunities. This program was undertaken to improve training of our students in veterinary practice management and business skills. For detained information about graduate programs, refer to the individual departments or write to the department concerned. See also the Graduate and Professional Bulletin .INTERDEPARTMENTAL PROGRAM Doctor of Veterinary Medicine A four-year professional program in veterinary medicine (Professional Veterinary Medicine or PVM) is offered annually to approximately 134 selected students. Because the number of applicants exceeds the number of students who can be admitted to any class, the Admissions Committee for the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences carefully evaluate each applicant to recommend those best qualified. Information concerning the academic program which leads to the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.) degree may be found in the Graduate and Professional Bulletin or at www.cvmbs.colostate.edu/ cvmbs/prmpro.html . The full course of study requires four years beyond completion of the pre-veterinary requirements. While exceptional students may complete pre-veterinary requirements in two to three years and then be accepted into the Professional Veterinary Medicine Program; it is much more common that students complete a baccalaureate degree followed by fours years in the professional program. Pre-Veterinary Training for the Professional Veterinary Medicine Program Students may take their preprofessional (pre-veterinary) training at any accredited institution whether these courses are part of a regularly offered baccalaureate program or whether the courses are taken as \"stand alone\" choices independent of a degree program. However, courses must be substantially equivalent in subject content and level as offered for pre-veterinary students at Colorado State. Inquiries regarding equivalent or substitute courses that may be taken SPECIFICALLY to meet pre-veterinary preparation requirements should be directed to the Office of the Dean, Assistant Dean for Admissions, Professional Veterinary Medicine, Campus Delivery 1601, Fort Collins, CO 80523-1601. While Colorado State students meeting the pre-veterinary requirements as an integral part of a degree program will take a higher number of credits, the minimum course requirements for admission to the Professional Veterinary Medicine program, exclusive of electives, are: Arts, Humanities, Behavioral and Social Sciences - at least 12 semester credits. (Agricultural or business courses and the required credits for English composition do not fulfill these requirements.) Biological Sciences - at least three semester credits in genetics and a laboratory associated with a biological science course.

College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences 305Chemistry - at least three semester credits in biochemistry and a laboratory associated with a chemistry course. English Composition - at least three semester credits. Physics - at least four semester credits with laboratory. Statistics - at least three semester credits (upper-division course preferred). Additional courses that are not required, but highly recommended, are anatomy, cell biology, developmental biology, histology, microbiology, nutrition, physiology, and computer science. These courses will enhance the student's preparation for the Professional Veterinary Medicine program. The pre-veterinary requirement is a minimum of 60 semester credits that must be completed prior to admission to the Professional Veterinary Medicine program. The clear majority of students completing the pre-veterinary requirements will do as a part of a baccalaureate program that is finished prior to the start of the professional program. Exceptional students may apply for admission to the Professional Veterinary Medicine program when only the pre-veterinary requirements are met, however, the number of such students competitively admitted is a small part of each class. Specific courses offered at Colorado State which currently fulfill the pre-veterinary requirements are listed in the following section. It should be noted that these courses could be used to meet the basic science and All-University Core Curriculum requirements for numerous baccalaureate programs offered at Colorado State University.

Deines, Associate Head for Undergraduate Education Professor Herbert P. Schweizer, Associate Head for Graduate Education and Research Major in Microbiology Microbiology is the study of organisms too small to be seen with the naked eye, including bacteria, viruses, algae, protozoa, and fungi. Microbiology emerged as a distinct science in the late nineteenth century, with the discovery that microorganisms are the cause of many infectious diseases, and that they play essential roles in the ecosystem and in industrial processes. Much work in this field is directed toward the cure, control, or eradication of disease in humans and animals. Genetically engineered microorganisms can also be used for the production of improved foods and new medicines, as well as for removing toxic wastes and spills from the environment. More recently, some microbes have received considerable attention as potential agents of bioterrorism and biowarfare, and consequently much work is being done to counter such threats. Microbiology majors ac quire knowledge and laboratory skill in the structure, physiology, genetics, pathogenicity, ecology, and taxonomy of microorganisms. Required courses in biological sciences, chemistry, physics, and mathematics support the major. Specialties are in human and animal infectious diseases, immunology, bacteriology, virology, molecular genetics, and environmental and industrial processes. Microbiology is an ideal major for students who are preparing for professional veterinary or human medical programs or graduate studies in various biological sciences.

College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences 309Potential Occupations Career opportunities in microbiology will continue to grow due to expansion of industrial biotechnology, greater public demand for improved medical care, increasing public dependence on new products of microbiological systems, an increasing concern for the impact of industrial and accidental pollution of soil and water, and a renewed awareness of the potential threat of microbes as weapons of mass destruction and bioterrorism agents. Academic programs in microbiology prepare students for employment in research and production laboratories operated by government agencies (such as the CDC, FDA, public health departments, and the military), industry (such as biotechnology, pharmaceutical, food, beverage, and medical device manufacturers), or private foundations. Additional opportunities are in technical sales and in university research and teaching. The level of education and the area of specialization determine employment opportunities. Part time laboratory work, internships, and cooperative education opportunities are highly recommended and will enhance a graduate's entry into permanent full time employment. Available career opportunities exist in many areas, including: basic research in bacteriology, virology, mycology (study of fungi), immunology, microbial genetics, microbial physiology, environmental microbiology, bioremediation, and biodefense; product research and development, quality control and bioprocess development; and diagnostic microbiology.

TERM F Taught fall semester S Taught spring semester SS Taught summer session The courses listed are those which are scheduled to be offered during the terms indicated. Since the frequency of class offerings is determined by the department in accordance with program needs, students should consult the official, applicable on-line class schedule (available on RAMweb) to be offered in a given term. The following types of courses do not indicate term; they will be offered when there is -99, Thesis or Dissertation. 7. PREREQUISITES The class schedule for each term is the best source for determining current prerequisites. Students are expected to meet all course prerequisites prior to registration for a specific class, or acquire the instructor's permission. Permission of the instructor for a student to attend a class is implied when the student has met specified prerequisites. All prerequisites may be considered to have been met if a student presents evidence of credit earned in equivalent courses or if knowledge equivalent to the prerequisites indicated is demonstrated. Academic prerequisites notwithstanding, a department may limit the enrollment in a class; classes may be limited to a specified number of students, to students of particular majors, or to students of particular class levels. In the listing in this catalog, only the most recent version of a course number is shown as a prerequisite. 8. COURSE FEES ($) Certain courses carry a special fee which is assessed at the time a student registers for courses. For a list of current course fees, refer to http://www.provost.colostate.edu/index. asp?url=ug_studies. Certain courses carry a variable fee which is assessed each student enrolled in the course based on expenses that fluctuate, e.g., expendable materials. These fees may vary by student and/or by term within the fee range specified at http://www.provost.colostate.edu/index.asp?url=ug_studies . 9. NONTRADITIONAL COURSE OFFERING ( -O, C, T, or V) This symbol ( ) indicates the course has been approved to be offered in a nontraditional format, usually as a distance course (on-line, correspondence, telecourse or videotape) through the Division of Continuing Education or other distance learning venue on campus.
