As a principal form of TCM, Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is comprised of treatments using multiple Chinese herbs which have complex chemical profiles. Due to a lack of understanding of its modality and a lack of standardization, there are significant challenges associated with regulating CHM's safety for practice and understanding its mechanisms of efficacy. Currently, there are many issues that need to be overcome in regard to the safety and efficacy of CHM for the further development of evidence-based practices. There is a need to better understand the mechanisms behind the efficacy of CHM, and develop proper quality standards and regulations to ensure a similar safety standard as Western drugs. This paper outlines the status of CHM in terms of its safety and efficacy and attempts to provide approaches to address these issues.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2019-01-18", "cleaned_text": "Current Status and Major Challenges to the Safety and Efficacy Presented by Chinese Herbal Medicine [https://doi.org/10.3390/medicines6010014](https://doi.org/10.3390/medicines6010014) [Safety of Complementary Medicines]( /journal/medicines/special_issues/Safety_complementary_medicines )) Abstract: 1. [2](#B2-medicines-06-00014)]. In clinical practice, 200 to 600 CMM are routinely utilised by Chinese medicine practitioners, with 50 considered as 'fundamental' [ [3](#B3-medicines-06-00014)]. CHM is increasingly in great demand not only in Asian countries but also in many western countries, with an international market estimated at approximately US$1.025 billion in 2016 [ [4](#B4-medicines-06-00014)]. Depending on different definitions and calculations, CHM represents about 20-50% of the herbal medicine market share worldwide [ [5](#B5-medicines-06-00014)]. In Western countries, CHM has been recognized as a popular form of complementary and alternative medicine with the belief that CHM incurs fewer side effects, as it is generally extracted from natural products without artificial additives [ [6](#B6-medicines-06-00014), [7](#B7-medicines-06-00014)]. [8](#B8-medicines-06-00014)]. With a steadily growing industry and the popular use of CHM worldwide, greater effort should be directed towards its safety and efficacy in order to minimise the safety risks and provide scientific proof and clinical evaluation for the continuous development of this ancient medical system [ [9](#B9-medicines-06-00014)]. 2. Challenges to the Safety of CHM [10](#B10-medicines-06-00014)]. 2.1. Inherent Toxicity [11](#B11-medicines-06-00014)]. For example, aristolochic acid, from Aristolochia debilis Sieb. et Zucc. (known as Madouling in CHM), can lead to rapid kidney failure, as seen in a group of women who had all taken the same weight-loss supplement [ [12](#B12-medicines-06-00014)]. Glycyrrhiza spp. (liquorice root) and its extracts, which are often used in CHM, as an expectorant, a corrective adjunct and a harmonising ingredient in many formula preparations [ [13](#B13-medicines-06-00014)], contains mineralocorticoid, which can cause adverse reactions such as oedema, hypertension and electrolyte imbalances [ [14](#B14-medicines-06-00014)]. Panax ginseng C. A. Mey. (known as Renshen or Hongshen in CHM), one of the most popular CHM herbs and used for a variety of conditions, including tiredness and poor circulation, has been associated with an 'abuse syndrome' characterised by insomnia, irritability and excitability [ [15](#B15-medicines-06-00014)]. [16](#B16-medicines-06-00014)]. Modern documentations on CHM toxicity are primarily based on compilations of scientific data generated from isolated or purified chemical ingredients in these herbs. For example, the Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) established the 'poison standard' that consists of decisions regarding the classification of medicines (including toxic compounds and herbal ingredients from CHM) and poisons into Schedules, for inclusion in the relevant legislation of the States and Territories. For example, aconite has been included in Schedule 4 of the Standard of the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons (SUSMP), and can only be prescribed by registered medical practitioners, dentists or veterinarians and dispensed by registered pharmacists [ [17](#B17-medicines-06-00014)]. In 2015, the Chinese Medicine Board of Australia (CMBA) commissioned the National Institute of Complementary Medicines (NICM Health Research Institute) to produce a new Nomenclature Compendium for CHM, which extracted restrictions and warnings from SUSMP and PPRC for over 600 of the most commonly used CHM, which greatly saves time and efforts for TCM practitioners referring to the safety information [ [18](#B18-medicines-06-00014)]. However, due to the nature of CHM practice, which relies largely on direct clinical experience over time, the precise toxicity data for most CHM are still limited, compared to modern pharmaceuticals [ [16](#B16-medicines-06-00014)]. Presently, adequate data regarding toxic herbs, toxic target organs, safe dose range, safety window of effective dose, minimum toxic dose and herb-herb/drug interactions are still lacking [ [19](#B19-medicines-06-00014)]. 2.2. Safety Risks in the Practice of CHM [8](#B8-medicines-06-00014)]. The safety risks identified in CHM practice include misdiagnosis, poor prescribing, failure to observe and/or explain contraindications, inappropriate dosage and duration of therapy, and failure to avoid known interactions with pharmaceuticals and precautions associated with a particular substance [ [20](#B20-medicines-06-00014)]. Inappropriate practice can be attributed to two reasons: Lack of regulation and inadequate training/education. According to a WHO report from 129 member states, up to 43.5% of traditional medicine practitioners were not regulated in 2012, and 56% of these practitioners did not have university-level education [ [8](#B8-medicines-06-00014)]. [21](#B21-medicines-06-00014)]. In China, all TCM practitioners are required to receive education and pass a Chinese medicine degree to be registered and practice legally. All TCM practitioners are regulated under the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine. However, aside from Australia, no Western countries have established a national regulation of TCM practitioners. Some countries such as the United States have regulations on certain TCM therapies such as acupuncture. In 2012, Australia became the only Western country to introduce a national registration for Chinese medicine practitioner. All TCM practitioners must be registered under the national registration and accreditation scheme with the CMBA to practice. They are required to master knowledge of the toxic and restricted herbs to lower the safety risks of prescribing CHM in Australia. As most Western nations have yet to start official regulation for TCM practitioners, the WHO put this concern into their Traditional Medicine Strategy report 2014-2023, as well as relevant strategies and actions to strengthen the safe use of CHM products by practitioners worldwide [ [8](#B8-medicines-06-00014)]. 2.3. Poor Quality Control [22](#B22-medicines-06-00014)]. A systematic review from Ernst (2002) summarised the data of CHM products adulterated with conventional drugs collected from six databases (Medline, Embase, Biosis, Amed, Cochrane Library and CISCOM) and revealed that the adulteration in the CHM products has led to 18 adverse reaction case reports, including two serious adverse events and four cases with contamination detected in their chemical fingerprints, one led to a fatality and at least were six potentially life-threatening [ [23](#B23-medicines-06-00014)]. [24](#B24-medicines-06-00014)]. [25](#B25-medicines-06-00014)]. Incorrect dosage can also cause severe safety problems. At least a dozen deaths, heart attacks and strokes have been reported due to the over-dosage of ephedra (known as Mahuang in CHM) [ [26](#B26-medicines-06-00014), [27](#B27-medicines-06-00014)]. [28](#B28-medicines-06-00014)]. The most severe effects by contaminations include agranulocytosis, meningitis, multi-organ failure, perinatal oedema, coma, intracerebral haemorrhage and death [ [28](#B28-medicines-06-00014)]. In 2015, a group of researchers from Curtin University, Murdoch University and the University of Adelaide conducted genetic analysis to assess the molecular content of 26 widely available CHM products, and reported that 90% were not fit for human consumption. Their results showed that more than 90% of the tested products were detected to have some form of contamination and/or substitution. Further, mass spectrometry revealed heavy metals including arsenic, lead and cadmium, one with a level of arsenic >10 times the acceptable limit and beyond the safe ingestion recommendations [ [29](#B29-medicines-06-00014)]. [30](#B30-medicines-06-00014)]. The international Organization for Standardization (ISO) is currently developing a range of quality standards of CHM, including raw materials and finished manufacture products, which may help develop and regulate the international market for CHM products. [10](#B10-medicines-06-00014)]. The herbal ingredients/chemical substances contained in the formula or CHM products that may cause potential toxicity to humans should follow the regulation. Some environmental related factors can be controlled by implementing standard operating procedures (SOP) including GAP, good laboratory practice (GLP), good supply practice (GSP) and GMP. 2.4. Self-Medication and Drug-Herb Interaction [21](#B21-medicines-06-00014)]. A number of self-poisoning cases using CHM have been reported. In 2011, a cross-sectional telephone survey of Hong Kong Chinese adults (n = 1100), with informed verbal consent, revealed that 71.7% (789/1100) reported using OTC traditional CHM in the past year, and 2.3% (25/1100) reported at least one adverse event during that time. Of the 27 adverse event cases reported among OTC CHM users, the most common adverse events were allergic reactions (n = 11) dizziness (n = 5) and gastrointestinal problems (n = 4) [ [31](#B31-medicines-06-00014)]. [31](#B31-medicines-06-00014)]. Another barrier was the perception that reliable knowledge of OTC CHM products could not be obtained from Western medical professionals [ [31](#B31-medicines-06-00014)]. Therefore, self-management of health using OTC CHM products with limited accurate and reliable safety information has the potential to lead to inappropriate use and safety issues. [32](#B32-medicines-06-00014), [33](#B33-medicines-06-00014)]. For example, Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge. (known as Danshen in CHM) was reported exaggerate the anti-coagulant response to warfarin [ [34](#B34-medicines-06-00014)]. Panax ginseng C. A. Mey. (known as Renshen or Hongshen in CHM) was also known to interact with warfarin, decreasing the international normalised ratio (INR) [ [35](#B35-medicines-06-00014)]. Ginkgo biloba L. (known as Yinxingye in CHM) was suspected to interact with ibuprofen, leading to fatal intracerebral mass bleeding [ [36](#B36-medicines-06-00014)]. Since the mechanism of the interactions is often not clear, it can certainly raise safety concerns for self-medicating if this is done without instructions and not carefully monitored [ [21](#B21-medicines-06-00014)]. [37](#B37-medicines-06-00014)]. This is required to strengthen the current regulation and quality control standards for CHM worldwide. To avoid adverse reactions caused by the interactions between Western pharmaceuticals and CHM, consumers should be encouraged to communicate with their healthcare practitioners about any use of herbal products, and practitioners should consider initiating such discussions [ [38](#B38-medicines-06-00014)]. It is also recommended that appropriate training be provided to medical practitioners and pharmacist on basic knowledge of CHM and ways to access the relevant information (e.g. drug-herb interaction database), so that they can be aware of and avoid potential interactions between orthodox drugs and CHM. In addition, pharmacists should provide adequate and accurate safety information about herbal products if available [ [39](#B39-medicines-06-00014), [40](#B40-medicines-06-00014)]. Greater dialogue between TCM manufacturers, retailers and Western health professionals is required to develop effective safety measures for OTC users. Information regarding evidence-based drug-herb interaction studies and contradictions should be further developed and made widely available for clinicians and healthcare practitioners, pharmacists, nurses and other allied health practitioners through various methods (i.e., online database, textbooks, education services, training, etc.). 3. Challenges to the Efficacy of CHM [21](#B21-medicines-06-00014)]. The multi-component and multi-target mechanism of CHM is inherently distinct from often the mono-substance and mono-target model of WM, so utilising the Western evaluation paradigm to investigate the efficacy of CHM is not adequate or efficient [ [16](#B16-medicines-06-00014)]. The difficulty of developing a research methodology that is suitable to study the complex nature of herbal formulae and reaching a stage where CHM produces products of assured efficacy are but two of the many challenges still facing CHM. 3.1. Non-Uniform Chemical Composition Leading to Inconsistent Therapeutic Effects [41](#B41-medicines-06-00014)]. In addition, a study from Dong et al. (2003) revealed that Panax notoginseng F.H.Chen (known as Sanqi in CHM) cultivated in the south-western parts of Wenshan during September to October presented the best quality in terms of the amount of the bioactive compounds such as saponin, flavonoid and polysaccharides [ [42](#B42-medicines-06-00014)]. Those bioactive compounds were reported to have a variety of bioactivities, such as anti-oxidant, anti-depressant, anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory activities [ [43](#B43-medicines-06-00014), [44](#B44-medicines-06-00014)]. Hence, these studies highlighted that the non-consistent chemical composition of CHM greatly affects biological activity, which raises a significant challenge for developing quality standardisation of the herbal materials and CHM products. 3.2. Multiple Clinical Endpoints [45](#B45-medicines-06-00014)]. Benefits produced by herbal medication include not only the regulation of several crucial biological targets but also, more importantly, the modulation of other associated general changes that delay the healing process. Therefore, a herbal formula that is designed to treat a TCM pattern can be applied for several Western diseases [ [45](#B45-medicines-06-00014)]. For example, Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (LWDH) is a classic TCM formula used for the TCM pattern 'Yin deficiency and tonify Kidney'. Nowadays, pharmacological studies have proven that this formula is effective for multiple diseases, including metabolic syndrome, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, based on long clinical experiences and pharmacological studies [ [1](#B1-medicines-06-00014)]. As there is no direct interpretation between TCM patterns and Western pathophysiology, elucidating the pathological mechanisms and translating TCM indications into Western clinical endpoints remains a great challenge. 3.3. Non-Standardised Ratio of Herb Ingredients [46](#B46-medicines-06-00014)]. In TCM clinics, there is no standardised ratio for a formula, especially when it is prescribed as a decoction. The ratio is designed by a practitioner based on clinical experience or traditional knowledge. It is difficult to systematically review the ratios used in the formulae and explain their rationale. The standardised ratio in Chinese patent medicines for specific clinical indications may give a clue. However, due to inadequate intellectual protection for CHM products in China, several manufacturers have kept the ratio confidential for their patent products. The non-standardised proportion of herb ingredients in traditional herbal decoctions make it difficult for researchers to establish their efficacy, as the therapeutic effects may not be optimal if the dosage of ingredients is incorrect. 3.4. Synergy and Synergistic Mechanism [7](#B7-medicines-06-00014)]. It is believed that the interaction exerts synergistic effects in a well-constructed formula so that the optimal clinical outcome can be obtained, and the key step to unravel the efficacy of CHM is to understand its synergistic mechanism. [47](#B47-medicines-06-00014)]. The synergistic concept in CHM involves enhanced therapeutic effects, reduced toxicity, network-target actions and promoted bioavailability [ [48](#B48-medicines-06-00014)]. The synergy concept in CHM formulae is introduced as compatibility principles, including Xiang Xu (synergism), Xiang Shi (assistance), Xiang Sha (elimination), Xiang Wei (detoxification), Xiang Wu (antagonism) and Xiang Fan (rejection) [ [47](#B47-medicines-06-00014)]. These principles are well established and extensively applied in TCM clinics, but the scientific rationale is still lacking. With the increasing popularity of Western drug combinational therapy, mathematic and computational models to quantitatively determine synergy (such as mathematic equations), computer bioinformatics technology and systems biology have been developed. These models were then gradually applied to explore the synergy and synergistic mechanism on CHM formulae. However, these models cannot effectively reflect the concept and draw useful conclusions for a holistic insight into CHM [ [49](#B49-medicines-06-00014)]. Due to the limits of current methodologies and laboratory techniques, CHM still confronts great challenges in investigating synergy to fully elucidate its efficacy. 3.5. Low Quantity and Quality of Efficacy Studies [7](#B7-medicines-06-00014)]. The majority of these studies, especially early studies, are compromised by methodological flaws. For example, a systematic review reported that more than 2000 clinical trials can be found for Xiao Yao San (a classic TCM formula used for insomnia for over 2000 years) published in Chinese databases, and only two have met the standard of double/single-blinded randomised controlled trials [ [50](#B50-medicines-06-00014)]. Since a herbal formula is designed to treat TCM patterns rather than modern diseases, with treatment according to 'syndrome differentiation', and the formula ingredients are usually tailored to each person's condition, thus it is rather difficult to design proper methodology for both clinical trials and pre-clinical studies. There are a large number of animal studies published in Chinese that show the overall effect of a single herb or a formula, but an exploration of the mechanism at the cellular, molecular and protein/gene levels is still needed. Moreover, many CHM products have not been subjected to scientific investigation to support clinical indications and potential therapeutic benefit [ [20](#B20-medicines-06-00014)]. Therefore, high-quality and rigorously designed clinical trials together with mechanistic studies are needed to show the efficacy of CHM. 4.
