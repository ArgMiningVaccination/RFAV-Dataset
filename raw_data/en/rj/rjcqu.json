{"title": "Proteomics Studies in Oncology Towards Personalized Medicine in Public Health: Opportunities and Challenges for OMICS Research in Iran", "author": "Zahra Mojtahedi; Abbas Ghaderi", "url": "https://www.eurekaselect.com/article/47089", "hostname": "eurekaselect.com", "description": "Although personalized medicine is not a new concept, recent advances in OMICS technologies and highthroughput discovery of biomarkers have taken this goal to greater heights as well as challenges, particularly from the perspective of globalized post-genomics science. The crucial question is to what extent developing countries can participate in this nascent healthcare facet in the 21st century? In Iran, this issue is even more challenging due to several cross-cutting factors such as inadequate financial and skilled human resources and importantly, sanctions on the import of a wide array of technologies that have seriously affected advanced proteomic instruments such as mass spectrometry.
