Students will have an opportunity to read contemporary descriptions about skin diseases by medical or non-medical authors and evaluate accuracy with regard to disease presentation, natural history and therapeutic interventions, if any. The dermatology library will provide the first three novels to each enrolled student for use during the Period. This library also has at least one edition of each contemporary novel for week 4 work that may be borrowed on a \"first request\" basis at the beginning of each Period.| |Objectives| |1. Detailed reading and critical analysis of three major works of literature by Camus (The Plague), Solzhenitsyn (Cancer Ward) and Updike (The Centaur) containing descriptions of skin diseases. | 2. Analysis of a more recent novel during the last week of this course from a list of selected books in the context of the previous readings and class discussions (see below). |Description of course activities| |During the first class meeting a lecture will be given about literary criticism, author background and how to write a critical essay. During the first week students will read The Plague (Camus, 1947, 308 pages) and discuss it in class with regard to the infectious disease (along with its skin manifestations) described and its central role in the book. During the second week, students will read Cancer Ward (Solzhenitsyn, 1968, 576 pages) and discuss neoplastic diseases including melanoma in the context of life in the former Soviet Union. During the third week, students will read The Centaur (Updike, 1963, 299 pages) and discuss the role psoriasis played in character development throughout the novel. During the last week of the course, students will select one of 19 recent novels listed on the course syllabus with a variety of different skin diseases. You will write a critical literary review about the new work in the context of the previous readings and discussions held during the class. | Students must attend all scheduled classes to receive course credit or complete a written assignment for absence to be excused. There are no makeup classes. Students must keep a detailed reading logbook that documents the number of hours spent each day reading the assigned materials and recording questions the student has about the reading for discussion during the next class period. Dr. Wagner will review these student journals during each class period. The novels required for this course are all available in the dermatology library and may be borrowed for the class. |Type of students who would benefit from the course| |Students interested in skin diseases and their impact on modern literature are encouraged to take this class.| |Clinical a reading-intensive course. During the last week students will be required to read the last novel and write a 5-10 page original essay.| |1.

If this course is an Acting Internship, please complete the following:| |A.||Objectives for the AI should relate directly to the Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs). Each AI should describe how the four key Year-4 EPAs that our school has identified as being Year-4 skills are assessed. The Year-4 objectives are: | 1. Entering and discussing orders/prescriptions.Specify how the student will be given formative feedback on their clinical skills. | | B. | | Year-4 students should demonstrate mastery of EPAs they developed in the clerkship year, including recommending and interpreting common diagnostic and screening tests, and performing general procedures of a physician. They should be able to demonstrate masterfully and independently skills they mastered in Years 2-3, including efficiently performing comprehensive admission-notes and succinct daily progress notes and perform accurate, concise, and hypothesis-driven clinical presentations, form clinical questions and retrieve evidence to advance patient care. They should be able to demonstrate basic understanding of and beginning mastery of collaborate as a member of the interprofessional team and identify system failures and contribute to a culture of safety improvement. List advanced clinical skills that a student will be assured an opportunity to practice. | | C. | | How specifically will this AI build on developing skills from the clerkship year to prepare students for internship? | | D. | | What opportunities will typically be available to all students who take this AI (procedures, required presentations, etc.)? What opportunities may be available based on patient load/presentation or student initiative (ie. Writing a case report)? | | E. | | An AI should have expectation of a minimum of 32 hours per week of clinical responsibilities. Duty hours should be capped at ACGME limits for an intern, thus up to 24 hours followed by 4 hours of activities related to patient safety, education, and handoff. Students cannot work more than 80 hours per week averaged over 4 weeks. They can only have 1 day off in a 7-day work week with 8 hours off between shifts. Clinical responsibilities will vary depending on specialty, but how is the student functioning with work commensurate to a PGY1 with an appropriate level of training? | | F. | | How is the student demonstrating drawing clinical conclusions and/or developing a management plan and documentation as an intern would do? | | G. | | How and by whom will midpoint feedback be provided to the student? How will you remediate deficiencies identified at midpoint? | | H. | | Acting Internship students often seek letters of recommendation following their experience. How many different Faculty will work directly with the student and have knowledge of the student's abilities to detail in a written evaluation? Describe the degree of supervision and interaction with faculty vs. residents or other providers and how feedback will be obtained if more direct work is with residents or other providers. "}
