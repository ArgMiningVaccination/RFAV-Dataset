Translated, it means Natural Union. This great God-given gift and tradition embody the innate and ultimate striving of humanity for all that is good and pure; it reveals a path as natural as breathing and leads the aspirant to union with God, union with Absolute Truth and union with Divine Love. ~ Yogeshwar Muni This book presents an introduction to a less-known path of surrender or natural meditation, where one abandon using will and surrenders all his actions and fruits of those actions to God. Although the centrepiece of all religions and mystical systems, the exact practice or sadhana, was traditionally transmitted only in secrecy, orally from a teacher to a disciple. This is one of the rare texts in English discussing this practice and the prerequisites to it. Michael E. Salihovich (Brahmananda) was a student of Yogeshwar Muni's (Charles Berner) teachings since the mid-1980s. He was initiated into Sahaj yoga in 2011 and has been giving Enlightenment Intensive retreats, meditation seminars and individual counselling for more than 30 years. "}
