Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain 2 or more of these 13 compounds. Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral respiratory infections.\" In materials entitled \"Resources for combin ed Chinese & Western medical treatment of CRsouOVID-19 [sic],\" accessible via a \"COVID-19 Resources\" option in your website's navigation menu, you present materi als relating to the use of \"Traditional Chinese Medicine in the prevention and tr eatment of COVID-19\" with various titles and descriptions, that collectively represent that the treatments discussed are effective in the treatment or preventi on of COVID-19, including: o \"Prevention and treatment of viral re spiratory infections by traditional Chinese herbs\"; Page 2 of 3 o \"Vitamin C and its Application to th e Treatment of nCoV Coronavirus\"; o \"Coronavirus: 85 percent of patients in China benefiting from traditional chinese [sic] medicine, officials claim\"; o \"Clinic characteristics and therapeutic proc edures for four for case [sic] with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia receiving combined Chinese and Western medicine treatment\"; o \"Coronavirus: Is Chinese medicine useful for fighting the disease? . . .

It may be no different with C OVID-19. Isolation, hand washing, social distancing and other protocols suggested by the CDC are effective and I also highly recommend the services of skilled qualified TCM herbalists for preventative and treatment measures with this virus. The Tr aditional Chinese Medical Clinic in Fort Collins, Colorado is an excellent resource for this care. Dr.'s Dayna and Monique Larson have had extensive training and thei r clinic has one of the most complete herbal pharmacies in Colorado.\" It is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 41 et seq. , to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-contro lled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they ar e made.

Thus, any Coronavirus- related prevention or treatment claims re garding such products are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. You must immediately cease making all such claims. Page 3 of 3 You are also advised to re view all other claims for your products and immediately cease making claims that are not supported by comp etent and reliable scientific evidence.
