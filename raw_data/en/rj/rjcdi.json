Since then, the pharmaceutical market and society have both evolved considerably, and Shionogi has grown by adapting its business in line with the changing times. However, over the past 140 years, one thing has not changed - our steadfast commitment to develop even better medicines, and to provide clear, accurate, and appropriate guidance for their proper use to healthcare professionals and patients. Even when business conditions have been tough, we have worked through the challenges without straying from our Company Policy: \"Shionogi strives constantly to supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve.\" That long-held policy is firmly entrenched in our organization as Shionogi's philosophy, supporting our growth through the years. SHIONOGI stated the goals it wants to achieve by 2030, as SHIONOGI Group Vision (2030 Vision): \"Building Innovation Platforms to Shape the Future of Healthcare\". We will continue to build upon our established capabilities as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company based on innovation and highly advanced expertise, while increasingly catalyzing the formation of new healthcare platforms as the partner of choice for companies and industries with complementary capabilities and expertise in other fields. In order to create new value by addressing the problems faced by patients and society more thoroughly, Shionogi will evolve from a pharmaceutical company whose primary role is to provide prescription drug to a HaaS* company that offers increasingly comprehensive healthcare services. In June 2020, we hasformulated and launched the Medium-Term Business Plan \"STS2030\", aiming to realize our vision for 2030our 2030 Vision. In the three fiscal years since we formulated STS2030, the external environment surrounding the healthcare sector has changed even more rapidly than we expected. The entire world underwent the social and medical turmoil caused by the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, struggled to contain the spread of the virus, reconsidered approaches to ensuring citizen safety, and reaffirmed the importance of people's health in maintaining a functional society. Under this rapidly changing environment, SHIONOGI has evolved its drug discovery capabilities and developed a COVID-19 therapeutic drug. In addition, building upon our foundations as a company, we have been working to to expand our range of products and services beyond prescription drugs. For example, we have developed our first vaccine and established a wastewater epidemiological surveillance service. "}
