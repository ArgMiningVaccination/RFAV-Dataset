In a release, Aspirus said childhood immunizations \"stand as a cornerstone of modern medicine and public health.\" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), four million deaths worldwide are prevented by childhood vaccinations every year. \"Vaccines work to protect children against serious diseases, shield community members and prevent outbreaks and resurgences of disease,\" Aspirus stated. Protecting children from serious diseases Aspirus said childhood immunizations are specifically designed to provide protection against a variety of dangerous infectious diseases. \"By introducing weakened or inactive versions of the pathogen into the child's system, vaccines prime their immune response to recognize and fight off the actual disease if encountered in the future\", said Jason Chan, MD, Aspirus Pediatrician. \"Diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, polio and pertussis (whooping cough) can have severe consequences for young children, leading to complications, hospitalization, and can even sometimes be fatal.\" Herd immunity: A 'community shield' Vaccines not only safeguard individual children, but also play a crucial role in protecting the wider community, Aspirus said. \"When a significant portion of a community is vaccinated against a disease, it creates a collective shield that prevents the pathogen from spreading effectively,\" Aspirus stated. \"As a result, even individuals who cannot be vaccinated, such as infants, pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems, receive indirect protection.\" Chan said achieving high vaccination rates \"ensures that diseases have limited opportunities to spread, making it less likely for outbreaks to occur and protecting vulnerable members of the community.\" Preventing outbreaks, resurgence of diseases Citing the National Library of Medicine, Aspirus said history has shown that when immunization rates drop, diseases once thought to be under control can make a resurgence. \"When a significant proportion of the population is immunized, it becomes difficult for a disease to find susceptible individuals to infect, effectively limiting its transmission,\" Aspirus said. \"This collective immunity prevents diseases from gaining a foothold and spreading rapidly, ensuring that outbreaks remain rare and previously controlled diseases do not make a comeback.\" Chan said immunizing children from an early age is \"crucial to providing them with the best defense against potentially devastating illnesses.\" \"Vaccines have been rigorously tested and proven to be safe and effective, safeguarding not only your child's health, but also that of the entire community,\" Chan stated. \"By taking this proactive step, you contribute to the collective effort of ensuring a healthier future for your child and others,\" Aspirus said.
