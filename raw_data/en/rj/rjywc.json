Case: A 19 year old male, with a history of violence towards others, killing animals, heroin addiction and incarceration and requested Holographic Kinetics after deciding he did not want to return to high security prison and did not want to die like his sister of an heroin overdose. Results: This patient experienced a significant change in behaviors from his tendencies prior to receiving Holographic Kinetic (HK) treatments. 6 months after the HK session, he has not consumed heroin and stopped killing animals as a hobby. He went back to school to learn fashion and how to start his own business. Conclusion: This case study shows a major potential for two of the biggest problems of our modern societies, criminal behaviors and heroin addiction among our youth. Why is it important to find a solution to heroin addiction? According to the CDC, heroin use in males between the ages of 18-25 is rising, adding fuel to an opioid epidemic. The CDC reports that nearly 15,500 people died from a heroin overdose in 2016 alone [1]. Every day, more than 115 people in the United States die after overdosing on opioids [1]. The misuse of addiction to opioids including prescription pain relievers, heroin and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl is a serious national crisis that affects public health and our economy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the total \"economic burden\" of prescription opioid misuse alone in the United States is $78.5 billion a year, including the costs of healthcare, lost productivity, addiction treatment and criminal justice involvement [2]. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th edition (DSM-5), offers definitions for substance use disorders in the United States. Included in this list are cannabis use disorder, stimulant use disorder, hallucinogen use disorder and opioid use disorder. Illicit drug use in the United States has increased over the last decade. Approximately 10.2% of the United States population, 27 million people and age 12 and older admitted to illicit drug use in 2014 [1]. Of this number 7.1 million people met the criteria for illicit drug use disorder. Marijuana is the third most commonly used drug in the United States. Accord to SAMHSA (2018), 4.2 million people ages 12 and up met the criteria for substance use disorder due to marijuana use, an estimated 1.4 million people met the criteria for substance use disorder due to cocaine and other stimulant use, and approximately 2.5 million people met the criteria for opioid use disorder; with an estimated 586,000 of these people being addicted to heroin. Many people with previous addiction to prescription opiates have switched to heroin because the drug is readily available and inexpensive in comparison [2]. Heroin is frequently mixed with other drugs resulting in variability in purity and increased risk of overdose. Since 1999, deaths related to opioid use have increased 265% in men and 400% in women [1]. Outside of recreational use, withdrawal symptoms encourage people with opioid use disorder to continue to use the drug despite issues with personal relationships, major obligations and social functioning [2]. It is a fact that heroin addiction, alone, in the United States has become very prevalent and unfortunately the root causes of addiction are not treated effectively in the United States. This leads to a never ending cycle of addiction for people of all genders, races and ages. \"Heroin is an opioid drug made from morphine, and it can come in the form of a powder, or a substance known as black tar heroin\" [2]. The effects of heroin are widespread and often have a rapid onset in the body. \"Heroin enters the user's brain and binds to opioid receptors on cells located in many areas, especially those involved in feelings of pain and pleasure\" [2]. Short term effects include nausea, dry mouth, clouded mental functioning and severe itching. Long term effects include insomnia, collapsed veins, infection of the heart lining and valves, mental disorders and other physical and mental effects. There are multiple kinds of treatments for heroin addiction. There are medicines such as buprenorphine and methadone that act as \"weaker\" kinds of heroin to attempt to wean the user off heroin slowly so they do not experience the intense withdrawal systems. It is, for the most part, ineffective and the prospect for a drug addict to get out of the vicious cycle of addiction is bleak. Mainstream medical practices have been failing and, for the last 50 years up to this day, drug addictions in the US still remain a national crisis [3]. In addition to the obvious human, social, psychological devastating impact on the individual and his/her family members, Heroin addiction has a huge economic cost for the United States. In this report done by Tami Mark et al., the researchers found that there are four broad cost areas stemming from heroin addiction: medical care, lost productivity, crime and social welfare. Medical care for heroin addiction consumes many resources. For example, methadone treatment, \"including medication and integrated psychosocial and medical support services (assumes daily visits) totaled $6,552 per patient per year\" [4]. In 2013, an analysis revealed that the total cost of prescription opioid use disorders and overdoses in the United States was $78 billion [5]. The physical and mental effects of heroin addiction are what cause lost productivity. Compared to the average wage earner, heroin addicts have characteristics that cause them to be less productive. These causes include dropping out of school, higher mortality rates, incarceration and the physical and mental effects that do not allow them to function in regular society [6]. What solutions to heroin addiction are available? A variety of psychological and pharmacological treatments, for heroin addiction, exist; but persons with addiction generally need long-term or repeated care to discontinue substance use and to recover their lives [5,7,8]. Treatment begins with recognition of the addiction and assessment client or patient by a health professional. Standard treatment of addiction generally involves behavioral individual or group therapy coupled with medication. Therapy is used to assist addicted individuals to understand their addiction and behaviors associated with their addiction and drug seeking. Therapy is also used to assist with development of coping skills and self esteem. Medications are used to relieve withdrawal symptoms and control cravings for the drug such as FDA approved medications like Methadone, Buprenorphine, Naltrexone and a combination of buprenorphine/naloxone medications [4]. The public health approaches toward this national crisis has been a failure for decades [8]. Controversy still exists over a true definition of serial killing; thus, the same issues exist in defining serial killers. A current definition of serial killing or serial murdering is defined as two or more killings, with or without the intention of committing additional murders, for personal gratification [9,10]. Serial killing, much like addiction, is driven by fantasy. Serial killers are pushed to kill by their thought patterns and an intrusive fantasy life that generally begins at an early age [11]. The view that harming others is normal and acceptable begins at an early age and is part of the fantasy that encourages continued harming of others [10]. Serial killers of humans often begin by killing animals. Although, man has been killing animals for centuries and for multiple reasons, the primary reasons being for food, killing is different for those with a tendency to become derelict serial killers. Researchers have found that although killing of animals is sometimes necessary, most people avoid killing animals for reasons other than necessary for survival [12]. According to some studies, men are more willing to support the killing of animals and traits like narcissism, sadism and psychopathy, positively correlate with violence toward animals [12]. Much of society views murderers as \"evil\" people that cannot live among \"normal\" members of the society. The reality is that most killers are children in adult bodies who have been traumatized and left untreated with their trauma still \"active\" [11,13]. 75% of perpetrators perceive themselves as victims [14]. 87% of serial killers are in a cycle of child sexual abuse [14]. Modern neuroscience attests to the immaturity of the brain as well as its malleability. This means the brain is interacts with experiences and can be changed by experiences; thus, it may be possible to change the brain by changing what the brain experiences [13]. What modern science fails to understand is that man is a multidimensional being living in a multi dimensional world, therefore little change in these areas will take place. On the other hand, Holographic Kinetics Healing Modality has been recognized in high security prisons for turning around and assisting in clearing the mentally ill inmates, repeat cyclces, PTSD, depression, anger, compulsive disorders and suicidal thoughts. Self harm, voices in the head and more Steve Richards, the founder of Holographic Kinetics, has been cleared and requested to go into the high security mental health wards of the Aboriginal prisons, where nothing tried by mainstream was working [15]. Steve Richards, using Holographic Kinetics, has obtained positive changes with every case. As a result, he has been awarded the 2005 Life Awards Certificate of Commendation from Suicide Prevention Australia, and was Nominated for the 2005/2006 Human Rights Medal awards, as recognition for the achieved outcomes in indigenous communities. Steve Richards was also selected for the 2004-2006 Torres Strait Regional Authority consultant register and nominated for 2007 Australian of the year [15]. The patient is a 19 year old young man, heroin addict with a criminal background that included time spent in a high security prison. His sister died of a heroin overdose when the patient was 18 years of age. That traumatic event and his desire to avoid prison made him seek professional help. His mother accompanied him to his appointment (s). The patient has been seen by Dr. Antoine Chevalier in Los Angeles for Holographic Kinetic sessions beginning in January 2018 and beginning of February 2018. During the first Holographic Kinetics session, we regressed in time when he was 4 years old. He was at his daycare. One of the female employees who took care of him at the daycare realized his mother was always late picking him up. She began locking him up in a closet and sexually abusing him, almost every weekday for just over a year. The patient shares that he became obsessed with what he calls \"the dark side\". At age 6 he started killing kittens and puppies. According to him, he murdered 78 innocent animals up to this day. He stated that he would attack family members during the day and night. He almost killed his mom, dad and sister in the middle of the night while they slept with a knife and a baseball bat. He was 6 years old. He said he \"thought animals and humans were objects\" since he was treated like an object when he was sexually abused by the woman employee at the daycare when he was 4 years old. As a result of his behaviors, he went to jail multiple times. He would attack security guards in jail and police officers. He was sent to a high security prison as a juvenile. His drug use started at age 13. He was addicted mostly to heroin. He was also selling heroin at this time. The patient consented to this publication. The patient received his first Holographic Kinetics session in January 2018. After this initial session, he stopped killing animals, stopped using heroin and did not return to jail. He received a second Holographic Kinetics session at the beginning of February 2018. He then made the decision to go back to school and learn fashion with the intention of starting his own business. He also began cleaning up his living space and taking showers. 6 months after the initial Holographic Kinetics session, his still drug free, according to his mom and himself, stopped killing animals as a hobby and is doing well at school. Holographic Kinetics (HK) is one of the most advanced Holistic \"Mental Health\" healing modality founded by Steve Richards, an Aboriginal descendant who took what he has been taught by his ancestors about the Universe and its laws of Lore, to a new scientific level of understanding, which took over fifty years of research in this field [15-17]. The HK practitioner understands the power of the subtle bodies in the creation and removal of internal created realities which are considered the original causes of mental illnesses. The HK practitioner is able to assist the patient's internal ability to correct his/her own imbalances in the energy field, mind and body of the patient. Just as there is an above, there is a below just as there is an internal invisible world, there is an external visible world and there is always the point zero of the observer (man's conscious choice) that is positioned between the two all imbalances occur in the invisible mind of man first and transmute into the visible as an effect of the imbalance. Visible effects can include anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, PTSD, Bi Polar, ADD, ADHD, stress, fear, anger, guilt, sexual problems and self-punishment to name a few. Holographic Kinetics aims assist a patient in accessing the causes of these imbalances, so they are able to bring those imbalances back into balance to remain in a state of homeostasis permanently once they have been addressed properly [15-17]. Holographic Kinetics uses the natural law of causality in action and reaction sequences [18-20]. Holographic virtually explains man is a hologram every cell in the body stores every thought and memory as it is sent from the subtle bodies within, out to all areas of the physical body and each cell has the ability to holographically reproduces those memories. These areas are called \"cellular memory\" and can store trauma from generations down the hereditary line they can be accessed and cleared [15]. Causality is commonly defined as the relationship between causes and effects [18,19]. It is considered to be fundamental to all natural science, especially physics, philosophy, statistics and modern experimental psychology [21]. Based on Minkowski spacetime scientific work, causality means that an effect can occur from a cause which is in the back (past) light cone of an event. Similarly, a cause can have an effect outside its front (future) light cone [25-25]. The action reaction pendulum of cause and effect feeds an invisible dimension within the internal world of a human energy field, creating a visible imbalance (anxiety, depression, etc.,) which needs to be brought back to null point zero vector observer within man's awareness by waking up to his responsibility of the metaphysical consequences of his own creation upon its own separate dimension of time [26,27]. Only then, will man's own imbalances be brought back to balance and the effect (mental illness) will finally cease to exist [15-19]. Kinetic energy is a free flowing, constant energy, inside and around us, until captured by thoughts. It then becomes potential energy, aligning itself into plutonic geometry forming a crystal, which now stores memory and locks into the stress point of the body in its own separate dimension known as \"time\" [15]. Holographic Kinetics is not limited to this physical dimension, but has an awareness of multi dimensions and sees man as a multi dimensional being in a multi dimensional world, consisting of multiple parts of the human form, in multiple dimensions that need to be cleared. This includes the Spirit and the soul [15]. Under \"royal commission in the bringing them home report\" it states: Bad health is not being connected to your spiritual being, this indicates those important parts of your life are not connected, being damaged by different forces not of our control or doing. In the united nations human rights and equal opportunity commission to mental health in Australia states\" Chapter 23; An aboriginal perception of Mental health is holistic; there is no need to compartmentalize.....Aboriginal mental health should not be viewed from a medical model of abnormality Aboriginal culture sees the health of the mind, the body and the spirit as inextricable linked Witnesses to the inquiry emphasized the fact that disturbed people are often perceived as a normal reaction to Spiritual forces or a curse, such as being 'Sung', Rather than being physical ill, the person is considered to be spiritually ill One of the fundamental aspect of a hologram is any part of the hologram contains the whole in the form of fractals of stored information [26-28]. Consequently, a piece of a long term memory is equally distributed over a dendritic arbor so that each part of the dendritic network contains all the information stored over the entire network of the genetic hereditary lines of the mother and father or beyond (epigenetics) and/or long term experience attached to the life force of the patient, coming through time [15-17]. In Aboriginal cultures this is the soul experiences. A well trained and experienced Holographic Kinetic Practitioner can assist the life force of the patient in accessing internal hyperspace within the patient, where all things become omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient within their own separate dimension of reality. In Aboriginal culture this is known as the spirit (the internal life form, the spark of life), which is different from the psych or soul (the external experience) stored as memory, within the cells. Therefore, the practitioner can successfully assist the patient to access and clear their created reality by correcting in the invisible the original cause of the visible effect within its own dimension of time that is affecting the patient at the moment of the treatment. The difference between the other treatments and this modality is the permanent improvement and positive outcomes you achieve as a practitioner for the patient [15-17]. A Holographic Kinetics Practitioner recognizes and addresses successfully the multi dimensions of man. The patient must deal with changing the self destructive processes, these inner patterns that erode the self and mental well being [15-17]. The patient, before and after treatment (4 days after, 4 weeks after and almost 4 months after), answered these Holographic Kinetics questions: Before a session; What is affecting you that you would like to look at If you looked over your life what are the cycles that you see that are affecting you What do you re-act to Have you taken any drugs or drink alcohol excessively What is the main issue that you would like to clear Have you been in a war zone Do you have voices in the head After a session next visit Do you still have voices in the head How do you feel since the session? Are you still on drugs or alcohol How did the family find your attitude, before the session What does your family find your attitude since the session Is there anything else that is affecting you that you would like to look at "}
