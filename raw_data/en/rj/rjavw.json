Coming down with the flu can lead to symptoms like fever, tiredness, or chills. Natural and home remedies can relieve some of the symptoms, however, there is no cure for the flu. The flu (or influenza) is caused by a virus. Several kinds of viruses can give you the flu. While there's no cure for the flu, there are [natural remedies](https://www.healthline.com/health/womens-health/yeast-infection-home-remedy) that might help soothe flu symptoms. They may also help shorten how long you have the flu. We'll review 10 natural remedies and explain how to use them, and why they can help. Drinking water and other fluids is even more important when you have the flu. This is true whether you have a respiratory flu or a stomach flu. Water helps to keep your nose, mouth, and throat moist. This helps your body get rid of built-up mucous and phlegm. You can also get dehydrated if you aren't eating or drinking normally. Diarrhea and fever (two common symptoms of a flu), can also cause water loss. You can stay hydrated by consuming plenty of: - water - coconut water - sports drinks - herbal tea - fresh juice - soup - broth - raw fruits and vegetables You'll know you're drinking enough water and liquids if: - you have to urinate regularly - the color of your urine is almost clear or pale yellow If your urine is a deep yellow to amber color, you may be dehydrated. It's also helpful to avoid smoking as much as possible since it can further irritate your nose, throat, and lungs. It's important to rest and get more sleep when you have the flu. Sleeping can help boost your immune system. This helps your body fight off the flu virus. Cancel your usual routine and make sleep a priority to help get you back on your feet. Drinking warm chicken or beef bone broth is a good way to help you stay hydrated. It helps to loosen and break up nose and sinus congestion. Bone broth is also naturally high in protein and minerals like sodium and potassium. Drinking broth is a good way to replenish these nutrients while you have the flu. Plus, protein is important for rebuilding immune cells. You can buy ready-made varieties, but be sure to look for those that are low in sodium (salt). You can also make your own broth by boiling chicken or beef bones. You can freeze portions of broth for future use. The mineral zinc is important for your immune system. This nutrient helps your body make germ-fighting white blood cells. Research shows that zinc might help ease cold and flu symptoms. Zinc helps your body fight the flu virus and may slow down how fast it multiplies. You can take a zinc supplement or a multivitamin with zinc during flu season. You can normally get plenty of zinc from a balanced daily diet. [Foods](/nutrition/best-foods-high-in-zinc) that are high in zinc include: - red meat - shellfish - lentils - chickpeas - beans - nuts - seeds - dairy - eggs A warm water and salt rinse (sometimes called a salt water gargle) can soothe a sore throat.

Mix 1/2 tsp salt to 8 ounces of warm water. - Pull the salt water to the back of your throat and gargle it for about 10 to 30 seconds so that it rinses your mouth and throat. - Spit the water into a sink and repeat 2 to 4 times. Do not swallow the salt water. Do not allow children to gargle until they can safely gargle with plain water. Several herbs have natural antiviral and antibacterial properties.

Some types of essential oils may help protect you against certain viruses and bacteria. One [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354210008120) found that tea tree oil helps to fight the flu virus by slowing or stopping the rate that the virus multiplies. According to the study, tea tree oil works best when it's used within two hours of infection. This shows that it may help to block the flu virus from multiplying. In practice, you might add a few drops of tea tree oil to liquid hand soap when you wash your hands or mixed into lotion you use. Some commercially made mouthwashes include it as an ingredient.

Diffusing essential oils into the air with a diffuser may also help against some kinds of viruses and bacteria. Be aware that aromatherapy has an influence on children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and pets. The flu virus survives longer in dry indoor air. This may make the virus spread more easily. Colder, outdoor temperatures generally lower humidity in the air. Indoor air can get dry from heating and air conditioning use. Using a humidifier to add humidity in your home and workplace might help reduce flu viruses in the air.
