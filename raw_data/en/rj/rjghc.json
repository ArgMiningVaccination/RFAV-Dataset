For more about her and her background, you can click here. As we can see, Deisher has a strong scientific background. The Importance of Independent Research When we are talking about scientific studies regarding vaccines, we are bombarded with pharmaceutical sponsored studies, studies that are sponsored by the vaccine manufacturers themselves. These are the studies used to justify the safety of various vaccines children receive shortly after birth and into their childhood. It's one of the most controversial issues in medicine today. I find it perplexing how many peer-reviewed scientific publications, old and recent, clearly indicate the multiple dangers that are associated with vaccines yet the public is often bombarded and heavily marketed with how safe vaccines are. Just as there is data suggesting vaccines are safe, there is also data suggesting that they aren't. This is why it's so important to do your own research, and not just accept what you are told blindly without investigation. Again, there are numerous publications in very reputable, peer-reviewed scientific journals that clearly outline multiple dangers associated with vaccines. But not all investigation should be limited to peer-reviewed scientific publications, we must also examine independent research from scientists, like Dr. Deisher. A common misconception is that the \"anti vaccination\" crowd does not understand science. Truth is, a large portion of the \"anti vaccination\" crowd are scientists, PhD's, and professors. \"Anti-vaccination\" movements are backed by a tremendous amount of science, just as is the \"pro-vaccination\" movement. But at the end of the day, there is really no need for these types of segregatory labels. It's best to examine the science from a place of complete neutrality. Often, our beliefs about vaccines prevent us from doing this. Efforts have been made to silence the ongoing critical discussion which questions the safety of vaccines. This is absolutely ridiculous, as this topic still has many unanswered questions. Science does not move forward through the censorship of critical discussion. Any call to silence the critical discussion of a still very open scientific question is troubling. Science progresses by investigation, debate and full discussion, not by censorship and omission of information. This is exactly why independent research is so important. Documents obtained by Lucija Tomljenovic, (another scientist and independent researcher who has shed light on important facts about vaccinations) PhD, from the Neural Dynamics Research Group in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at the University of British Columbia reveal that vaccine manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and health authorities have known about multiple dangers associated with vaccines but chose to withhold them from the public. This is scientific fraud, and suggests that this practice continues till this day. (source) A recent whistleblower from the CDC also recently admitted that the CDC has omitted data that links vaccines to autism, you can read more about that here. This is one small example (out of many) about the type of information we don't hear about, but is extremely important to know about. "}
