[Visit the Integrative Medicine Website](https://hartfordhospital.org/services/integrative-medicine/integrative-medicine) Recent surveys show that more than half of all Americans use some form of complementary or alternative therapy to enhance their healing or maintain their health. Research has shown that relaxation techniques such as Acupuncture, ART for Healing, Guided Imagery, Imagery for Surgery, Massage Therapy, Therapeutic Touch, and Reiki help to decrease anxiety, strengthen the immune system, diminish pain, and accelerate healing. While we often focus on the physical aspects of healing, we are learning that healing incorporates the mind, body, and spirit. When mind-body techniques are used, benefits are often experienced on all three levels and there is often a greater sense of participating in the healing process. [Back to Top](#top) Treatment Options Why Choose Hartford Hospital? Since 1997 Hartford Hospital has been translating a new philosophy that integrates complementary therapies into Western medical practice to improve care and healing. A Simple, Yet Strong Beginning Beginning with our Women's Health Services, which offers Reiki, Infant Massage, and Guided Imagery, the hospital's commitment to Integrative Medicine has grown rapidly. The Integrative Medicine Program was officially launched in1999 through a series of projects in Cardiology, Orthopedics, and Oncology by extending the Women's Health Services to patients, families and staff. Careful data collection measured overwhelming positive outcomes in pain reduction, anxiety relief, and patient satisfaction. As we moved into a new millennium, we began offering community education programs to the public while our first Integrative Medicine Grand Rounds began to provide education to the medical community. In subsequent years ART For Healing, Acupuncture, Therapeutic Touch, Tai Chi and Yoga were added. Education is Critical Building on the knowledge that education was key to the growth and success of this program, a special collection of books, audio and videotapes was added to the hospital's Medical Library. This collection is available for use by the public, hospital and affiliated staff. A Bright Future The program recently celebrated its 7th anniversary and continues to grow and expand its services. The Integrative Medicine Department is committed to embracing the healthcare needs of Hartford Hospital as well as the community it serves.
