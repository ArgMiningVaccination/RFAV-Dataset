The process induces detoxification along the body's natural purification pathways, primarily emetic (vomiting), and takes approximately one hour. There is no visionary component involved (no \"tripping\"), but rather a potent cleanse. The medicine is carefully and intentionally gathered from the skin of the wild Amazon tree frog. The frogs are set free afterwards and are not harmed in this process. Kambo is a medicinal substance produced by the skin of the wild Amazonian tree frog as a defense against predators, primarily aboreal snakes. For humans, however, kambo has a vast array of potent medicinal properties from detoxification to relieving inflammation. It kills viruses, bacteria, and pathogenic fungi, and it is also sought after as a natural treatment for many chronic conditions including: - Lyme disease - PTSD, anxiety and depression - Candida overgrowth, SIBO and other forms of gut dysbiosis - Addictions of all kinds, including drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, sugar and junk food Emotionally, kambo is a cathartic healing medicine that helps us release stuck emotional pain, grief, anger, and related baggage from the past. Metaphysically, kambo removes negative energy, heavy/funky vibes, negative karma, and cam heal past life or ancestral patterns too. Kambo raises your vibration and makes it easier to trust life, have faith, sense into your intuition, attract miracles and blessings, and open the door to new opportunities. The result of the cleanse is the amplification of psychic gifts, a feeling of greater soul alignment, and improved wellness on all levels of being. By removing density from this lifetime, past lives, and ancestral karma as well, it catapults us into a higher frequency of life experience and makes us magnetic to blessings. The Origin of Kambo The legend is that a shaman named Kampu was looking for a cure for his people in the Kaxinawa tribe in the Amazon jungle. His village was full of lethargy, depression and sickness. He drank ayahuasca, a sacred plant medicine used for divination, and he learned in his vision that the kambo \"frog sweat\" could heal his people. Today, kambo is used by many tribes in many countries for physical healing of sickness, to clear \"panema\" (funky energy), for warrior initiations, for spiritual activations, and to cleanse the body of human odors and heighten intuitive senses before hunting trips. About the Medicine Kambo medicine comes from wild frogs in the Amazon rainforest. The frogs are briefly tied up as the secretions are gathered from their skin with a stick. They are then released back to the jungle unharmed. The medicine is applied through superficial burns in the skin that put it directly into your lymphatic system, and then it travels throughout the body, propelled by the movement of the cardiovascular system. Typically it does produce a purge in the form of cathartic vomiting. It takes about one hour for the treatment. Our ceremony may last 90 minutes, however, with intention setting. Usually you will want to have an hour or two of downtime after your treatment to rest and recover. But some people find they need to take the whole rest of the day off and others, meanwhile, spring up immediately after the purge and feel ready to return to life as usual. It is a unique thing. "}
