To exclude possible strain replacement induced by immunological pressure following vaccination , strain monitoring was requested in the EMA Risk Management Plan. The aim of this expert opinion is to provide EU/EEA Member States with relevant scientific information and expert opinion to support the decision -making process o n the possible introduction and monitoring of routine vaccination of infants against RVGE . Methods The evidence presented in this document are based on reviews of the literature published in scientific journals , grey literature and a search in the E uropean Medicines Agency Eudravigilance database (EMA EV) for reported cases of intussusception vaccination information burden of RVGE in the EU/EEA in children under five years of age rotavirus vaccine efficacy in countries with low mortality due to RVGE (hereafter referred to as ' low-mortality rotavirus countries ') rotavirus vaccine effectiveness in low -mortality rotavirus countries herd protection provided by infant rotavirus vaccination in low -mortality rotavirus countries rotavirus vaccine safety in low -mortality of using rotavirus vaccines in EU/EEA immuni sation programmes attitudes to rotavirus vaccination among parents and healthcare workers The expert opinion provided in this document , is based on available evidence evaluated by a group of independent EU/EEA public health experts. The opinion highlights issues to be considered before and after introduction of rotavirus vaccines. It also identifies knowledge gaps and areas in need of further research. Results Burden of rotavirus disease in the EU/EEA A literature review identified 46 studies conducted in eighteen EU/EEA Member States assessing severe disease leading to hospitalisation , suggesting that approximately 300600 children per 100 000 under the age of five years are hospitalised due to RVGE annually. H owever , significant variation occur s over time and bet ween countries . Extrapolating these data to the whole EU/EEA with a birth cohor t of approximately five million infants suggest s that ~75 000150 000 hospitalisations in children under five years occur on an annual basis . In addition, an estimated 2-4 times more children seek medical evaluation in emergency rooms or other out -patient facilities. Mortality rate s reported in two studies w ere low (one study found death rates of less than 0.1/100 000 and the other less than 0.2/100 000 children under five years of age). A few risk factors for development of severe RVGE were identified, but severe disease may develop in any child. The risk factors identified were low -birth-weight (<2 500 g) (OR 2.8 ; 95% CI 1.6 5.0), day -care attendance (OR 3.0 ; 95% CI 1.8 5.3) and having another child aged under 24 months in the same household (OR 1.6 ; 95% CI 1.1 2.3). Children seeking medical attention in emergency departments/out -patient clinics or those hospitali sed with RVGE have the potential to be sources of nosocomial infection in other children attending medical services . In a recent meta-analysis of studies of nosocomial RVGE , an adjusted year -round incidence of 0.7 (95% CI 0.0 1.8) per 100 hospitalisations was estimated for children under five years. The vast majority of human ca ses with RVGE within EU/EEA are caused by six for EU/EEA were identified at lower incidence but no novel emergi ng str ain causing larger outbreaks had been detected until 2016, although the time period surveyed is short for virus evolution . However, t here is no evidence to date that rotavirus vaccination programmes are driving the emergence of vaccine escape strains . Vaccine efficacy A Cochrane review published in 2012 evaluated vaccine efficacy of RV1 and RV5 in 41 randomised controlled trials with 186 263 participants. The trials compared one of the rotavirus vaccine s with placebo , no intervention or another vaccin e. The RV1 vaccine was evaluated in 29 trials involving 101 671 parti cipants and the RV5 vaccine in 12 trials involving 84 592 participants. The large trials were conducted in low - and high -mortality settings Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 2 throughout the world. The Cochrane analysis sho wed that in the first two years of life, RV1 and RV5 prevent more than 80% of severe cases of RVGE in low -mortality developed country settings. Further more, a German systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised placebo -controlled clinical trials ( RCTs) assessing RV1 and RV5 , conducted in Europe, Australia, Canada, USA, Latin America and Asia and published in 2013 suggest s a vaccine efficacy against rotavirus -induced hospitalisation during the first two years following vaccination of 92% (95% CI 8296%). Vaccine effectiveness Rotavirus vaccine effectiveness was assessed in observational studies using either case -control or cohort study design s in the following rotavirus low -mortality and developed countries: Australia (RV1 Spain (RV5), and the US (RV1 and RV5). After at least two doses of rotavirus vaccine, pooled vaccine effectiveness in prevent ing severe RVGE leading to hospitali sation was es timated at 84% (95%CI 75 89%) in case -control studies (based on 15 studies) and at 91% (95%CI 88 94%) in cohort studies (based on four studies). Herd protection A meta -analysis of studies conducted to estimate herd protection in children less than one year of age in low -mortality rotavirus countries (n=5) reporting on RVGE outcome s suggest a median herd effect on RVGE morbidity of 22% (1925%) across 12 study years. Vaccine safety An earlier first generation, US -licensed oral live rotavirus vaccine RR V-TV (Rotashield, authorised 1998) was withdrawn from the market because of an associated estimated excess of one additional case of intussusception (IS) per 4 670 to 9 474 infants vaccinated (beyond the natural background incidence of IS). In pre -authori sation trials , which served as the basis for authorisation of the new second generation of rotavirus vaccines in the EU /EEA, no increased risk of IS was observed in recipients of either rotavirus vaccine (RV1 or RV5), compared to the placebo groups. This w as also the conclu sion of the 2012 Cochrane systematic review assessing vaccine safety in randomi sed placebo -controlled clinical trials. However, a risk of IS lower than one additional case in 10 000 vaccinated infants could not be excluded in the conducte d trials. Formal pharmaco -epidemiological studies in Australia, Brazil, Mexico and the US assessing the second generation of rotavirus vaccines used in routine vaccination programmes indicate that rotavirus vaccines carry an increased risk of intussuscepti on during the first seven days following dose 1, ranging between 1 per 20 000 to 1 per 69 000 for RV1 vaccinated infants and 1 per 14 000 to 1 per 67 000 for RV5 vaccinated infants in the different studies . Contrary to this , in the studies conducted by Belongia et al, Shui et al and Haber et al , using the US VAERS or US VSD data , no increased risk of intussusception following RV5 was observed , possibly due to small sample size. Following a formal review of available data by the EMA, t he EU Summaries of Product Characteristics (SPCs) for both rotavirus vaccines were updated in May 2014: 'Data from observational safety studies performed in several countries indicate that rotavirus vaccines carry an increased risk of intussusception, mostly within 7 days of vaccination. Up to 6 additional cases per 100,000 infants have been observed in the US and Australia against a background incidence of 33 to 101 per 100,000 infants (less than one year of age) per year, respectively. There is limited evidence of a smaller increased risk following the second dose. It remains unclear whether rotavirus vacci nes affect the overall incidence of intussusception based on longer periods of follow up'. Risk minim isation strategies to reduce incidence of intussusception following rotavirus vaccination have been recommended by a few European public health agencies/N ITAGs in three countries (Germany, Norway and two regions in Sweden) recommending initiation of vaccination early within the first 6 -8 or 12 weeks of life . The impact of these strategies needs to be carefully studied but a recent meta -analysis indicates that if vaccination with the first dose is provided at under 12 weeks of age , rather than later than 12 weeks, the risk of intussusception following vaccination is reduce d from approximately 1 in 20 000 to approximately 1 in 50 000. Other identified adverse events include severe gastroenteritis and long -term excretion of rotavirus es by severely immunocompromised vaccinated infants (SCID) , for whom RV vaccines now are contraindicated. Further more, any vaccinated infant may transmit vaccine virus to severely i mmunocompromised contacts of any age and therefore contact between a newly vaccinated child and such individuals should be avoided. Cost-effectiveness in EU/EEA M ember States Identified studies on cost -effectiveness of universal rotavirus vaccination in t he EU/EEA provide discrepant results . The inclusion of societal costs and/or positive indirect benefits of the vaccines such as herd immunity, significantly affects the cost -effective ness ratios . A recent survey in EU/EEA Member States conducted by the VEN ICE III network found that eight out of eleven countries having undertaken economic assessments have introduced rotavirus vaccines into their programmes. SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 3 Rotavirus immunisation programmes in EU/EEA As of May 2017, thirteen EU/EEA Member States were recommending vaccination against RVGE in their national paediatric immunisation programmes and had initiated or were about to initiate the programme and one further Member State have implemented vaccination in some regions of the country . Attitudes to rotavirus vaccination among parents and healthcare workers One study is available from the EU/EEA on attitudes to rotavirus vaccination among parents and healthcare workers. This study from the Netherlands concluded that w hen deciding about vaccination against rotavirus, parents are driven by the out -of-pocket costs, vaccine effectiveness, duration of protection, and frequency of severe side effects. Further, t he highest vaccination coverage is expected for a vaccine with high effectiv eness and long protection duration implemented within the national immuni sation program me context. In countries that report vaccination coverage for rotavirus vaccines used in national immuni sation programmes, the coverage ranges between 61 and 93% , sugges ting good acceptance among parents, care providers and healthcare workers. Conclusions and possible implications for public health practice and research Burden of disease studies assessing RVGE overall and severe disease leading to hospitalisation conduct ed in eighteen EU/EEA countries suggest that ~75 000150 000 hospitalisations occur annually in childre n aged under five years, while mortality is low . In addition, an estimated 2 -4 times more children seek medical evaluation in emergency rooms or other out -patient facilities. Two rotavirus vaccines (RV1 and RV5) for use in routine immuni sation programmes have been authorised for prevention of RVGE and sh own, in a series of studies, to be effective in preventing severe RVGE leading to hospitalisation as well as mild to moderate disease in need of medical attention . Vaccine effectiveness against RVGE -related hospitali sation ranges from 8590 % in countries with low mortality due to rotavirus disease (all EU/EEA countries categorised as low -mortality countries). Further more, herd protection contributes to the overall impact of vaccination programmes. A risk of up to six additional intussusception cases per 10 0 000 infants within 7 days of vaccination has been identified for both rotavirus vaccines , as specified in respective EU/EEA SPC. Benefit -risk has been assessed by many regulatory agencies throughout the world including Australian TGA, EU EMA, US FDA and found to be positive , given the severity of rotavirus disease and availability of treatment for cases of intussusception. However, in accordance with the recommendations of several public health agencies, options for risk minimi sation with the current vacc ines should be explored and vigilance among parents, care -providers and healthcare workers is essential to ensure that affected infants are promptly treated . The expert scientific panel suggests the following set of data collection and monitoring to be co nsidered at the EU - level and in EU/EEA Member States before and after introduction of rotavirus vaccines into a routine immuni sation programme: case-based routine or sentinel surveillance of severe leading to hospitali sation and/or death virological s urveillance in a statistically sound and geographically representative sample of circulating strains investigation and reporting of hospitalised breakthrough rotavirus disease in vaccinated individuals (including genotyping and detection of other possible pathogens, i.e. adenovirus, norovirus, sapovirus , etc.) estimation of country -specific background rates of intussusception (by month of age during first year of life) collection of data on individual vaccine exposure (inclu ding age and batch number) in manual or electronic registries and overall vaccine coverage Furthermore, EU/EEA countries could consider measuring the impact of rotavirus vaccines in formal epidemiological studies for clinically relevant disease endpoints that may include surveillance of reduction in hospitalisation of children due to RVGE , reduction in emergency room visits due to RVGE and reduction in the number of stool samples referred to laboratories for rotavirus diagnostics. Three gener ic study protoc ols for vaccine effectiveness and impact studies using different methodologies are available for use on the ECDC website. Further studies assessing the frequency, extent of complications (e.g. need for surgical resection of intestine) and possible underlying medical conditions predisposing to development of IS are needed in the European setting. In addition, EU/EEA countries that have implemented risk reduction strategies with early vaccination should consider conducting pharmaco -epidemiological studies to inform others of the potential impact of such interventions. Finally, sharing available health economic models assessing cost -effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination should be encouraged so they could be used i n various settings by those EU/EEA countries interested . Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 4 1. Background In 2006 , two live rotavirus vaccines for oral use in infants were authorised by the European Commission for prevention of group A vaccines into EU/EEA routine immuni sation programmes has been limited . As of May 2017 thirteen EU/EEA M ember States were recommending vaccination against RVGE in their national p aediatric immuni sation programmes and ha d initiated or were about to initiate the programme and one further Member State have implemented regional programmes . Rotaviruses are classified serologically into serogroups (A -G) (see Figure 2 in the Section 'Overview of human rotaviruses' ). Rotaviruses in group A are the most common cause of gastroenteritis in young children worldwide and the new rotavirus vaccines offer protection against these infections. Estimates suggest that by the age of five years, every child in the worl d will have been infected with group A rotavirus es at least once. While infected, many of these children will suffer severe disease and be in need of medical attention due to extensive fluid loss (3). Further more, group A rotaviruses are a frequent cause of diarrhoea -associated deaths estimated at approximately 528 000 (range, 465 000 -591 000) worldwide annually in year 2000 (4, 5), occurring mainly in developing countries while i n developed countries mortality is low, thanks to medical supportive healthcare being readily available (6). Already in 2007 WHO SAGE recommended the inclusion of rotavirus vaccin es into national immuni sation programmes in regions where efficacy data from randomi sed clinical trials suggested th at rotavirus vaccines would provide significant protection against severe disease , mainly in the Americas and Europe (7). In 2009, after clinical trials had been performed in more deprived settings , the recommendation was extended to include all infants thro ughout the world , with the vaccination being provided any time between six and fifteen months of age (8). Furthermore, i n 2013 , although still favouring early immuni sation, starting as soon as possible after six weeks of age along with DTP vaccination , WHO SAGE recommended the removal of the upper age restriction of 15 months for the first dose , to also enable children w hose i mmuni sation was delayed to be fully vaccinated (9). By recommending that the age restriction be removed, it was hoped that it would be possible to help protect vulnerable children in settings where DTP doses are given late. However, b ecause of the typical age distribution of rotavirus infections , rotavirus vaccination of children > 24 months of age was not recommended. The aim of this expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy is to provide EU/EEA countries with relevant scient ific information to support the decision -making process o n the possible introduction and monitoring of routine vaccination to prevent RVGE . SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 5 Rotavirus disease Symptoms The clinical spectrum of RVGE is wide in young children, ranging from transient mild diarrhoea to severe gastroenteritis with concomitant fever . Primary infections frequently result in a symptomatic episode of acute gastroenteritis (AGE), while reinfections are often asymptomatic or mild and only rarely lead to hospitali sation (10, 11). Symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting and fever may all contribute to the significant dehydration observed in some children (12). The vast majority of RVGE episodes are mild or moderate , however, s evere rotavirus disease leading to hospitalisation is often observed in the age group 0-36 months (see Figure 1), an age group when children are particularly vulnerable to dehydration . This is also the age wh en most children acquire their first rotavirus infect ion (13, 14). The incubation period for RVGE is 1-2 days. Symptoms are commonly relieved within three to eight days, but may last up to two or occasiona lly even three weeks in healthy , well-nourished children . Figure 1 . Number of rotavirus samples per age group (years) submitted to 16 EU/EEA countries ' rotavirus reference laboratories for genotyping 2006 -2016 and reported to EuroRotaNet *, showing that the major burden of disease is in the 0-3 year age group but disease is reported in all age groups *Further information available at www.eurorota.net Complications In some children e xtensive nausea an d vomiting results in difficulties in providing oral rehydration in home setting s, and may lead to severe fluid loss with or without accompanying electrolyte disturbances (hypo-, iso- or hypertonic dehydration that may require prolonged rehydration treatment). Further complications may include seizures due to high fever or electrolyte disturbances, encephalitis/meningiti s, shock and possibly death . Long-term, some children develop chronic diarrhoea and in more deprived settings malnutrition . In an observational retrospective cohort study conducted in Sweden (n=987), complications requiring additional medical attention , other than general dehydration , were observed in >15% of hospitalised children with RVGE (15). Younger children (<12 months) were particularly prone to more severe dehydration (>10% of body weight). Extraintestinal spread of rotaviruses to blood, cerebrospinal fluid, heart and liver has been reported and is suggestive of rotavirus es causing an invasive viral infection , rather than one confined to the intestinal mucosa (16- 21). In previously healthy well -nourished children, treated for rehydrat ion before development of shock, no residual sequelae develop following an acute rotavirus infection. However, access to good clinical supportive care is crucial. Natural rotavirus disease has only rarely been identified as a cause Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 6 Infections in immunocompromised children In general, rotaviruses do not cause more severe clinical symptoms in moderately immunocompromised patients, however, prolonged shedding of rotaviruses may occur in these individuals (23, 24). Severe, prolonged and even fatal rotavirus disease may develop in those with severe immunodeficiency conditions such as severe congenital immunodeficiency, solid organ or bone marrow transplantation (25).The severity of rotavirus disease among children infected with HIV may be similar to that of non -HIV infected children (24), however whether the incidence rate of severe rotavirus disease among HIV -infected children is similar to or greater than that among non -HIV infected children is unknown . Nosocomial infections Children seeking medical atten tion -patient clinics or hosp italised with rotavirus disease have the potential to be come sources of nosocomial ly-acquired infection s (26-29). Infections in family and household members Household transmission of rotavirus disease is common. Adults and older siblings in contact with young children experiencing their primary rotavirus disease are at particularly high risk of developing a rotavirus disease . In a Canadian study it was shown that in 47% of hospitali sed rotavirus cases at least one other family member experienced AGE in association with an index case infection (30). Among these household contacts experiencing diarrhoea, most were below five years of age but 16 % were adults. Only occasionally did household members need medical attention, but symptoms prevent ed some from attending school or work. Asymptomatic infections Asymptomatic rotavirus infections are common among neonates (31-33), older children and adults (34, 35), including healthcare workers (36). All these groups are likely to be protected against symptomatic disease due to an immune response acquired during one or more previous rotavirus infections earlier in life or , in the case of neonates, through mater nal antibodies providing protection during the first 3 -4 months of life (37, 38). Viral load in stool samples from individuals with symptomatic infection is significantly higher than in individuals with asymptomatic infection (39). Nonetheless, asymptomatic carriers are likely to play a role in sustained transmission of rotaviruses in the human population as well as boosting the initial acquired primary immune respons e. Risk factors for severe disease Severe rotavirus disease may develop in any child, however a limited number of risk factors for development of severe disease were identified in three studies (40-42). In these studies low -birth-weight infants (<2 500 g) were shown to be at increased risk of hospitalisation even beyond the first few months of life (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.6 -5.0) and children in day-care were more likely to be hospitalised than those cared for at home (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.8 -5.3). In addition, another child <24 months of age in the household was also shown to be a risk factor (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.1 -2.3). In contrast, breast -feeding was shown to protect against hospitalisation for rotavirus disease , with an increased risk for infants <6 months of age if not breastfed in the month before hospitali sation 1.2 -13.2). Pathogenes is Rotaviruses , first discovered in 1973 (43, 44), primarily infect mature intestinal epithelial cells on the tips of the small intestinal villi. Destruction of infected cells and subsequent development of villous atrophy reduces digestion and absorption of fluid and nutrients , resulting in secretory diar rhoea with loss of fluids and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen. In addition, one of the viral non -structural proteins, NSP4, which can be detected early during a rotavirus infection has been reported to function as a viral enterotoxin, and is thought to play a role in the development of symptoms (45). Further , spread of rotaviruses systemically may be more common than previously understood, since antigenemia/vir aemia a nd subsequently elevated transaminases (S -AST and S -ALT) have been reported (17-21, 46, 47). Mode of transmission Rotavir uses are mainly transmitted from person -to-person through the faecal -oral route, but transmission may also occur through contaminated objects (e.g. door -handles, water -taps, toilet -seats and toys), airborne droplets or contaminated water or food (48, 49). Rotaviruses may persist on dry surfaces for up to two months (48). Animal rotaviruses from infected animals are also occasionally transmitted to humans and may result in co -infections with human rotav iruses and development of new emerging serotypes/genotypes through the reassortment mechanism (50). SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 7 Infectious dose and virus shedding The infectious dose is small, an inoculum of as few as 10 -100 particles is sufficient to produce illness in susceptible individuals. The typical excreted virus load is between 108-1010 particles per mL faecal sample in children with their first rotavirus infection . Virus shedding has been described for up to three weeks or even longer in healthy immunocompetent individuals (51). Moreover, cases of c hronic rotavirus shedd ing have been reported among severely immunodeficient children (23). Routine diagnostics As mentioned earlier, t here are several serogroups of rotaviruses that may infect humans , including A, B and C. Serogroup A is the most common and therefore most laboratory assays only detect serogroup A rotaviruses. Excretion of rotaviruses electron microscopy. Clinical management Clinical m anagement is directed towards early replacement of fluid losses using oral rehydration at home. However, with more extensive fluid losses there may be a need for nasogastric or intravenous rehydration , alone or in combination, provided in hospital setting s. Earlier no other treatment a part from fluid replacement was available and no other ther apy is requ ired in previously healthy individuals since the condition is self -limiting . In some clinical settings probiotics (e.g. Lactobacillus GG) have been used to reduce duration of gastroenteritis (52). However , with the authorisation of racecadotril (Lincoln Medical Limited, UK ), an additional treatment option is available that will reduce the number of days with diarrhoea (53). Racecadotril, an enkephalinase inhibitor with potent antisecretory activity but only limited effect on gut motility, is intended for children older than three months and is administered via the oral route together with oral rehydration solution . Treatment should be continued until two normal stools are recorded and should not exceed seven days. No antiviral drugs are available. In the rare instances that immunodeficient children develop chronic excretion of rotaviruses , treatment with intravenous or oral immunoglobulin may be indicated , however, o ral immunoglobulin administered for prevention of rotavirus disease, although safe, did not provide protection against rotavirus disease in hospitali sed low birth -weight infants (birth - weight <2500 g) according to a 2011 Cochrane review (54). Protective efficacy induced by natural disease against subsequent clinical infections The protective efficacy of a n episode of natural infection in a young child against subsequent symptomatic re - infection s is estimated to be 58 -75% (10, 11, 55). However, it is important to distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. Re -infections occur throughout life. In a prospective cohort study performed in Mexico, a single rotavirus infection early in life was shown to provide protection against a subsequent laboratory - confirmed infection with rotavirus in 38% of all children, while 77% were protected against a subsequent symptomatic laboratory -confirmed rotavirus infection and 87% against a subsequent severe symptomatic laboratory -confirmed rotavirus -induced gastroenteritis (10). In a large observational retrospective study in a northern European setting (n=987) spanning 11 years, it was shown that children are rarely hospitalised more tha n once (<0.2% of hospitalised children with rotavirus disease ) for an acute rotavirus infection (15). Serological correlates for protection including cross -immunity Serological correlates of protection aga inst rotavirus infections are poorly understood, but are likely to involve neutrali sing antibodies to the rotavirus o uter surface viral (VP4 -specific and sing and VP7 (see Figure 2 'Human rotavirus particle' ) and cell - mediated immunity all develop after a primary rotavirus disease infection (56). In addition, a humoral immune response is known to develop to other internal viral proteins such as VP6 and the non -structural protein 4 (NSP4) known to have toxic effects (57, 58). Immune response after a primary infection with group A rotaviruses is thought to be mostly against t he infecting serotype/genotype but heterotypic cross -protection is also observed (59). A broader heterotypic response is elicited following further re -infections (symptomatic or asymptomatic) , possibly explaining why immunity is cumulative. Since natural rotavirus infection s do not provide steril ising immunity, it is not expected that the vaccines will provide sterilising immunity in vaccinated individuals. Reinfections are also expected in vaccinated individ uals, which will likely induce and maintain heterotypic protection . Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 8 Rota virus vaccines available in EU/EEA countries Two live vaccines for oral use providing prevention against rotavirus disease were authorised in EU/EEA in 2006; Rotarix, a vaccine (RV1) developed from a human rotavirus strain attenuated through serial passage in cell culture (GlaxoSmithKline strains and a bovine rotavirus strain (MSD, Lyon, France) (1, 2). The indication for these vaccines is active immuni sation of infants for prevention of gastroenteritis due to rotavirus (see Table 1). EU dose recommendations The dose recommendations , as mentioned in respective EU/EEA SPC , vary for the two rotavirus vaccines: RV1 should be administered in two doses any time from the age of six weeks , with an interval of at least four weeks between the doses. The full vaccination course of two doses should preferably be given before 16 weeks of age, but must be completed by the age of 24 weeks. RV1 should not be used in infants >24 weeks of age (see Table 1 ). RV5 should be administered in three doses any time from the age of six weeks , with an interval of at least four weeks between each of the three doses. The first dose should be provided at no later than 12 weeks of age, and it is preferable that all three doses should be administere d before the age of 20-22 weeks. If necessary, the third dose may be given up to the age of 32 weeks (see Table 1 ). The reason for the narrow age window for dose 1 in particular , but also for completion of the whole series , is to ensure protection before o bserved peak of rotavirus infection and the experience with an earlier first generation oral live rotavirus vaccine , Rotashield\u00ae (RRV-TV), licensed in 1998 in the US. Following the introduction of this rotavirus vaccine into the US national immuni sation pr ogramme it was found to be effective in providing protection against hospitalisation due to RVGE (60), but an adverse event was reported - development of intussusception (IS). IS was later found to be epidemiologically associated with this vaccine and the vaccine was therefore withdrawn from the US market (61, 62). An estimated risk of one additional case of intussusception per 4 670 to 9 474 infants vaccinated was identified. Infants with intussusception who had received the f irst or second dose of RRV -TV fourteen or fewer days before the onset of this condition were younger than other infants with naturally occurring intussusception (mean age at the time of hospitali sation, 4.1 vs. 6.4 months, P< 0.001; range, 2.0 to 7.0 vs. 1.0 to 11.0 months) (61). In further follow -up studies of this vaccine it was also shown that infants vaccinated before day 60 of life had no increased ri sk (>70 000 doses administered) and infants vaccinated day 61 -90 of life were significantly less prone to develop intussusception than children vaccinated after day 90. (63). EU/EEA countries may recommend immuni sation schedules within the span of the EU/EEA SPC recommendations (see Table 4 for choices made by countries that have introduced rotav irus vaccines .) Breastfeeding and rotavirus vaccination Breastfeeding should be continued ad lib around the time of rotavirus vaccination and withholding breastfeeding at that time is unlikely to improve the vaccine immunogenicity (41, 64). Concomitant a dministration of other paediatric vaccines Both rotavirus vaccines can be administered concomitantly with other monovalent and/or combination infant vaccines containing one or more of the following antigens: D, T, aP, Hib, IPV or OPV, HBV, PCV , Men B and M enC. Non-concomitant administration of the two live viral vaccines RV and OPV is an alternative (65). Vaccination of premature infants The recommendations for vaccination of premature children differ between th e two vaccines. RV1 may be given to preterm infants born after at least 27 complete weeks of gestational age (66). RV5 may be give n to infants born prematurely provided that the period of gestation was at least 25 weeks (67). Apnoea has been reported in premature infants following administration of RV1 and RV5. Due to excretion of vaccine virus in stool from vaccinated infants that may cause symptoms in the youngest and most vulnerable premature infants , most neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) do not offer vaccination until the infants are discharged from hospital. This results in a number of unvaccinated premature children vulnerable to severe rotavirus disease undergoing prolonged treatment period in NICUs. A retrospective cohort study using electronic records and assessing clinical symptoms in RV5 vaccinated (n=96, born at gestational age 32.6 weeks \u00b15.0) and unvaccinated patients (n=801, born at gestational age 34.8 weeks \u00b15.0) treated in a neonatal intensive care unit was conducted to evaluate safety. Results suggest that RV5 vaccination was well tolerated , with no indication of symptomatic transmission to neighbouring unvaccinated infants , but diarrhoea was observed in 18/96 (19%) vaccinated infant s compared to 1/801 control infants (68). Authors conclude that a larger prospective study is needed to assess severity of observed diarrhoea, virus shedding and transmissibility .

Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 10 Vaccination of infants with immunodeficiency and immunodeficient close contacts Excretion of live vaccine virus has been shown to occur after vaccination of healthy infants with both rotavirus vaccine s (69). Approximately 50% of RV1 vaccine recipients were shown to excrete vaccine virus after the first dose of RV1 and 4% after the second dose (1) while approximately 9% of RV5 vaccine recipients excreted vaccine virus after dose 1 (2) and 0.3% after dose 3 (70). Peak viral shedding generally occurs around 7 days after the first dose. Transmission of vaccine virus to healthy individuals ha s been observed with limited or no clinical symptoms (71). Live rotavirus vaccines should always be administered with caution in individuals with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency , as well as to infants in close contacts with immunodeficient patients . Following identification of chronic rotavirus secretion, EMA and other global regulatory agencies have approved a labelling change in the SPC for the two (RV1 and RV5) vaccines contraindicating administration to individuals with a history of severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID) (72). Safety and efficacy have not been establ ished for use of RV1 and RV5 in other , blood dyscrasias, leuk aemia, lymphoma, malignant neoplasms affecting bone marrow or lymphatic system, infants on immunosuppressants including high -dose corticosteroid s, or infants with primary and acquired immunodeficiencies , including cellular immune deficiencies, hypogammaglobulinemic and dysgammaglobulinemic states. Specific recommendations for use of rotavirus vaccines in immunocompromised patients with asplenia, c ancer, symptomatic HIV infection, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, cochlear implants, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (prior to or after), sickle cell disease, solid organ transplant (prior to or after), those receiving immunosuppressive therapy for chronic c onditions a nd contacts of immunocompromised patients are available from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). They are based on international consensus, however, often with limited evidence (73). An individual benefit -risk assessment taking into account the risk of natu ral infection vs . vaccination could guide clinical decisions. Children with asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can be offered rotavirus vaccines (74), however, there are differing indications in the EU/EEA SPCs of RV1 and RV5 and vaccinators should consult their respective SPC before considering administration of rotavirus vaccines to infants diagnosed with HIV. Vaccination of infants with other underlying medical disorders With the exception of vaccination of premature infants , no experience has been obtained from clinical trials to vaccinat e infants with underlying medical disorders including gastrointestinal disease, growth retardation, or having received blood transfusion, plasma or immunoglobulins within 42 days since they were all excluded from the trials. However, a prior intussusception is listed as a contraindication against RV vaccination . In one retrospective review of nine infants with functional short gut syndrome secondary to an ileostomy who had received RV5, vaccination in eight out of the nine in fants did not alter expected weight gain or body temperature (75). However , one of the infants developed significant stomal losses , resulting in weight loss after vaccination. No other reports on vaccination of infants with other underlying medical disorders was identified in the scientific literature. Vaccinati on of infants exposed to biological therapy in utero Women with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increasingly receive biological therapy (e.g. antibodies against tumour necrosis factor , such as infliximab, or certolizumab) , influenc ing their immune response. During pregnancy this treatment will also impact the immune response of their new -born infants. A position statement by the World Congress of Gastroenterology on biological therapy for IBD notes that infants exposed to biological th erapy in utero should be given routine vaccinations at standard schedules during the first six months of life, except for live -virus vaccines such as rotavirus (76). Interchangeability Interchangeability between the two vaccines RV1 and RV5 has formally been evaluated (77-79). Mixed schedules are safe and induce comparable immune responses when compared with vaccination with only one of the licensed rotavirus vaccines given in the full series . Vaccine -induced immunity The immunological mechanism s by which rotavirus infection with either wild -type or vaccine strains protect against subsequent rotavirus disease are not completely understood. Humoral and mucosal immunity is believed to play an important role . Since no serological correlate of protection has been identified , serum IgA has been used a s a surrogate marker by both vaccine manufacturers in the clinical trials . A high level of serum IgA antibody has been shown to correlate with clinica l protection against rotavirus disease (80, 81). However, t he IgA assays used by the two manufacturers are different and not comparable. In addition, for RV5 neutralis ing antibodies directed against rotavirus genotype G1 ha ve been utili sed (Goveia et al Poster ESPID 2014).

Contamination of RV1 and RV5 vaccines with porcine circovirus In 2010 , the presence of whole porcine circovirus (PCV) was identified in RV1 and genome PCV1 and PCV2 were identified in RV5. PCV are animal viruses infecting pigs. Human exposure to PCV is common due to its presence in meat and other food products of pig origin. The origin of PCV contamination of the two rotavirus vacci nes was attributed to porcine trypsin , used during the manufacturing process to facilitate infection of the cell line to propagate the rotaviruses. The EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( EMA CHMP) reviewed the contamination and, based upon the fact that PCV does not cause human disease, concluded that the benefit -risk balance was not changed1. However , manufacturers were instructed to develop PCV -free vaccines. A similar recommendation was issued in 2010 by WHO2. 1 http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2010/07/news_detail_001059.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058 004d5c1 and http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2010/09/news_detail_001121.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c1 2http://www.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/PCV1_Q_and_As_rotavirus_vaccines_3Jun10.pdf Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 12 Rotavirus vaccines autho rised in non -EU/EEA countries and vaccine candidates Three additional rotavirus vaccines are authori sed in China , India and Vietnam , respectively and additional several vaccine candidates are at various developmental stages. An oral, live lamb rotavirus v accine , containing monovalent group A genotype G10 P[12] is being produced by Lanzhou Institute of Biological Products, Lanzhou, China. The vaccine was approved in 1998 for prevention of rotavirus disease in children aged 2 to 59 months in China. A case -control study conducted in Chinese children 9 -11 months old showed that one dose of the Lanzhou rotavirus vaccine provided 44.3% (95% CI, 28.4 -56.7%) protection against laboratory - confirmed rotavirus infection in an area where rotavirus is a notifiable disease ; 52.8% (95% CI, 40.8 -62.3%) protection in children 12 -17 months old, and 51.8% (95% CI, 11.6 -73.8%) protection in children 18 -35 months old (86). Uptake of this vaccine in the routine immun isation programme has been limited (87). Further more, an oral, live human -bovine reassortant rotavirus vaccine , derived from a neonatal group A rotavirus strain isolated f rom an Indian infant (116E, genotype G9 [P11]) , has been developed and is now being produced under the trade name ROTAVAC by Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad, India (88-90). ROTAVAC was licensed in India in 2014 and is currently being in troduced into the Indian national immuni sation programme. The vaccine was developed in collaboration with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( US NIAID), the US Cente rs for Disease Prevention and Control (US CDC) and PATH ( formerly Program for Appropriate Technology in Health) and the Indian vaccine producer . NIAID sponsored early clinical trials in healthy adults and children and initial studies were conducted in the US. Overall vaccine eff icacy against severe rotavirus disease in Indian children up to two years was shown to be 55.1% (95% CI 39.9-66.4; p<0.0001); vaccine efficacy in the second life , 48.9% (95% CI 17.4 -68.4; p=0.0056) , was only marginally less than in the first year of life [56.3% (95% CI 36.7 -69.9; p<0.0001) . In Vietnam a live attenuated G1P[8] strain isolated and developed into an oral vaccine by the Center for Research and Production of Vaccines and Bio logicals in Vietnam is now authorised after having been tested in healthy Vietnamese infants (89); In total, four rotavirus vaccine candidates currently in human clinical trials can be identified on the website ClinicalTrials.gov. Among them several candidate vaccines are being developed under non -exclusive licen ces for technology transfer and productio n of the N ational Institute of Health human -bovine (UK) reassortant vaccine granted to the Chengdu Institute of Biological Products (China), Instituto Butantan (Brazil), and Serum Institute of India Ltd. (India): a randomi sed, double blind, placebo -contro lled phase 1 clinical trial assessing safety and immunogenicity of a new 5 -valent rotavirus vaccine candidate for oral use , produced by Instituto Butantan in Brazil , has been conducted in healthy adults (n=80)3 (91). This vaccine candidate is receiving financial support from PATH and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; randomi sed, double blind, placebo -controlled phase 1 & 2 clinical trials assessing safe ty and immunogenicity in adults, toddlers and infants of a new 5 -valent rotavirus vaccine candidate (BRV -PV)4 for oral use produced by the Serum Institute of India Ltd have been conducted (92). This vaccine candidate will now undergo a large Phase 3 study to assess efficacy against severe rotavirus disease ; a randomi sed, double -blind, placebo -controlled dose -escalation phase 1/2 descending age clinical trial , assessing safety and immunogenicity of a VP8 subunit vaccine5 truncated VP8 subunit from the strain G1P8 fused to tetanus tox oid and adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide for intramuscular administration in three concentration s 10, 30 or 60 g ), sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation/PATH non- replicating rotavirus vaccine project. The study is being conducted in the US. First study results from healthy adults were published in June 2015 (93); a randomi sed, double -blind, placebo -controlled phase 3 trial assess ing efficacy of RRV -TV for the preven tion of rotavirus disease in Ghana, West Africa, with infants receiving the first dose of two during the neonatal period , the second before they are 60 days o ld, and with follow -up to age 12 months. RRV -TV was, as mentioned previously, licensed in the US in 1998 but withdrawn in 1999 due to a rare association with intussusception, which occurred disproportionately in infants receiving their first dose at 90 days of age (94). A vaccine efficacy of 63.1% against rotavirus disease of any severity was observed , which is similar to the obtained efficacy acquired by RV1 and RV5 in similar African settings (95). Funding for this trial was made available through the International Medica Foundation, a non -profit foundation. 3 Clinical trials registration NTC 00981669 4 Clinical trials registration NCT02133690 5 Clinical trials registration NCT01764256 SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 13 In addition to the clinical trials listed on the ClinTrials.gov website, a neonatal rotavirus strain (RV3 -BB isolated from an Australian infant) candidate ha s been tested in a randomi sed placebo -controlled Phase I study that evaluated safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of the RV3 -BB rotavirus vaccine candidate in 20 adults, 20 children and 20 infan ts (10 vaccine recipients and 10 placebo recipients per age cohort) (96). Most infants (8/9) who received RV3 -BB demonstrated vaccine take developing IgA antibodies following a single dose. These data support progression of the RV3 -BB candidate to Phase 2I immunogenicity, safety and efficacy trials that will be conducted by academic groups in New Zealand and Indonesia with funding from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, New Zealand Health Research Council, the Bill and Melinda G ates Foundation and the vaccine producer , Bio Farma in Indonesia. Neonatal and infant schedules will be evaluated. Finally, in animal models both inactivated rotavirus whole virion and virus -like particles (VLPs) provided parentally have been shown to provide protective immunity. No human clinical trials appear to have been initiated for any of these technologies. Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 14 Overview of human rotaviruses6 6 Knipe D, Howley P Rotaviruses Fields Virology 6th Edition 2012 Figure 2. Rotavirus particle The virus particle consists of a triple -layered icosahedral protein capsid, composed of an outer protein (VP7 in yellow), an intermediate protein (VP6 in blue) and an inner core (VP2 in green) layer. From the smooth surface of the outer layer, sixty spikes extend ~12 nm (VP4 in orange). Mature and infec tious virus particles are approximately 70 -75 nm in diameter. The infectivity of rotavirus particles depends on the presence of the outer protein layer. Viral particles present on objects may be infectious for months. Rotaviruses are relatively stable when inactivated. Infectivity is retained within pH range 3 to 9 and virus samples are stable for months to years at + 4 \u00baC. The virus genome contains eleven segments of double -stranded RNA, providing a possibility for reassortment. Rotaviruses are classified serologically into serogroups. A serogroup comprises viruses that share cross -reacting antigens detectable by a number of immunological tests. Seven distinct serogroups have been identified (A -G). Serogroups A, B and C cause disease in humans, while the ot hers have primarily been identified in animals. Domestic animals commonly excrete rotavirus of different types, which occasionally can be transmitted to humans as a zoonosis. Cross -immunity between serotypes has been shown. Rotaviruses may also be genotype d. Generally, genotyping is currently used for classification of circulating rotavirus strains but must be correlated to the knowledge of serotypes/serogroups. Determination of the potential development of protective immunity after vaccination to current a nd emerging new rotavirus strains is correlated to serotypes. Serotype/genotype classification of group A rotaviruses uses the specificities of the two outer capsid proteins; viral protei n 4 (VP 4) and viral protein 7 (VP 7). The VP7 specificity is referre d to as G - type (glycoprotein) and the VP4 specificity as P - type (protease -sensitive protein, trypsin cleavage of VP4 initiates penetration of intestinal epithelial cells). Both VP4 and VP7 induce production of neutralising antibodies. 15 G -sero/genotypes have been identified in animals and humans, while 11 distinct P -serotypes and 28 P -genotypes have been described. Various combinations of G - and P -types have been identified in field isolates from humans. Classification of rotaviruses is a binary system t hat includes both the VP4 and VP7 types. SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 15 Post -authorisation monitoring of circulating rotavirus strains in EU/EEA countries To exclude possible strain replacement induced by immunological pressure following vaccination, rotavirus strain monitoring was requested in the EMA Risk Management Plan. The segmented genome of rotaviruses facilitates genetic reassortment when intestinal epithelial cells are infected with more than one rotavirus geno-/serotype. This property has the potential to generate many combinations of outer surface viral G - and P proteins (theoretically > 211 different combinations). However, the number of G and P c ombinations commonly detected is significantly less than the theoretical number of possible reassortant combinations, although reassortant group A rotaviruses develop regularly (see Figure 3). Reassortments may occur between two types of human rotaviruses or one human type and one animal type of rotaviruses co -infecting one individual (50). Figure 3. Schematic overview of the rotavirus reassortment process when two rotavirus sero- /genotypes infect one enterocyte simultaneously * * The uncoating process of each virus particle after entry into enterocytes expose the different segmented genes and provide the possibility for reassortment of different genes that may result in new rotavirus geno -/serotypes with different surface proteins [G - and P -types]. Infecting viruses enter the epithelial cell from the intestinal surface and new progeny viruses are released back int o the intestine resulti ng in epithelial cell death and subsequent villous atrophy. Rotavirus strain surveillance to exclude strain replacement Rotaviruses cause winter seasonal peaks of gastroenteritis in EU/EEA between December and May . However, sustained transmission is ide ntified all year round (see Figure 4) and variation in seasonality is observed (97). Establishing the viral cause for a hospitalised case of diarrhoea is rare, since patient management of dehydration is not influenced by the identified pathogen. Therefore, to ensure genotyping of a statistically sound and geographically representative sample within the EU /EEA the European Rotavirus Surveillance Network (EuroRotaNet)7 was formed to collect and g enotype faecal samples from European children seeking medical advice for rotavirus disease . This network is supported by producers of the RV1 and RV5 vaccines , to fulfil requirements in the EMA Risk Management Plan agreed upon authorisation of the two new rotavirus vaccines RV1 and RV5 to monitor possible strain replacement induced by immunologic al pressure following the use of rotavirus vaccines. Participants in the network have mainly been p ublic health institutes and academia in initially sixteen EU/EEA Member States and since 2014 fourteen Member States after Bulgaria and Lithuania left the network . The requirements from EMA will subside shortly and it is unknown whether the vaccine producers will continue to 7 www.eurorota.net Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 16 support the network long-term beyond 2017 and no formal surveillance of rotavirus infections and circulating rotavirus strains are foreseen in the EU/EEA in the near future . Rotavirus strain diversity Results from the EuroRotaNet strain surveillance network on genotyping of rotavirus strains from ten consecutive seasons (2006 - 2016) are now available (98, 99) (see Figure 5). Genotyping is performed in a standardi sed manner across the countries by multiplex PCR and/or sequencing. Annual qualit y assurance programmes are conducted. Figure 4. Temporal distribution of rotavirus positive samples submitted to the EuroRotaNet strain surveillance network database in consecutive season s 2006 to 2016 * * With seven of the countries conducting rotavirus strain surveillance having introduced routine rotavirus vaccination for all infants, an overall decline in number of samples sent for genotyping has been observed since 2014 . Source: Eurorotanet The vast majority of human cases within EU/EEA and worldwide (more than 90% of all human rotavirus disease ) are caused by the EuroRotaNet network confirm that G1P[8] was the most prevalent rotavirus strain since its inception , but all six genotypes circulated in all countries (see Figure 5). However, for two seasons G1P[8] was identified in < 50% of infected children and for the first time in the 2015/16 season G1P[8] was only the fourth most prevalent strain and identified in only 13% of typed samples8. In the 2015/16 season G9P[8] was the predominant strain, present in 34% of all specimen tested and the most common strain in five countries. This change in predo minant strain occurred in countries with and without routine rotavirus vaccination. Further analysis of the 2015/16 season is on -going and expected to be published late 2017. A new emerging genotype G12P[8] was identified in most seasons in the majority of participating EU/EEA countries in 0.5 -0.8% of all stool samples an d other new emerging G8 - and G1 0-containing strains were also identified , but with lower incidence . Vaccine efficacy has been evaluated against G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8] and G4P[8] and G9P[8] in the clinical trials perfo rmed in the Americas and Europe (1, 2)] for RV1 and in addition against G12P[8] for RV5. Significant cross -protection is expected , also for new emerging genotypes, as suggested by clinical trials performed in Malawi (RV1), South Africa (RV1) and Ghana (RV5) , which are countries with a more diverse picture of co- circulating rotavirus genotypes (100, 101). Vaccine efficacy in these studies ranged between 49.4% and 76.9% , where only approximately 13 % of the rotavirus strains were G1P[8]. However, the circulating genotypes may not be the only reason for a lower efficacy observed in these countries.

Overall distribution of rotavirus genotypes by EU/EEA country reported to the EuroRotaNet strain surveillance network 2006 to 2016 (n=61 959) Source: Eurorotanet In the data collection by EuroRotaNet, 1.5% of the rotavirus strains were reassortments amo ng common human strains, while 1.2% were likely to have emerged through zoonotic transmission or by reassortment between human and animal rotavirus strains. Mixed infections with more than one genotype present in stool sample were detected in 5.7% of cases and 3.8% of strains were only partially characteri sed. However, until 201 6 no novel emerging group A rotavirus strains causing larger outbreaks had been detected in any of the countries under surveillance , although the time period surveyed is short for virus evolution. The number of rotavirus positive cases available for typing has diminished in all the countries that have introduced rotavirus vaccination, as a consequence of the reduct ion in rotavirus dise ase (see Figure 4) . There is no evidence to date that rotavirus vaccination program mes are driving the emergence of vaccine escape strains, and shifts in strain distribution and predominant type in the post -vaccine era need to be interpreted with caution a nd in the context of differences in distribution of genotypes according to age and seasonality9. 9 EuroRotaNet: Annual report 2016 (unpublished data) Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 18 Rotavirus immuni sation programmes in EU/EEA countries As of May 2017 a positive decision ha d been taken by the national health authorities in thirteen EU/EEA countries regarding the introduction of rotavirus vaccination in to routine paediatric immunisation programmes and vaccination ha s already been implement ed or is underway . Austria , Belgium , Estonia, Finland , Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg , Norway , Poland and the United Kingdom have introduced rotavirus vaccination throughout the country , while Sweden ha s introduced vaccination in some regions .10 Among the eighteen Member States that have not included rotavirus vaccination in the r outine paediatric immuni sation schedule, a positive decision has been taken but not yet implemented in Ireland and Poland . A negative decision has been taken by national health authorities in four countries (Cyprus, Denmark, France and Spain) , while in the remaining countries no decision (either positive or negative) ha s been made by national health authorities as to whether to introduce rotavirus vaccination. Details on decisions made, year of introduction in countries with a positive decision, recommended age groups, vaccine coverage obtained and the proportion of cost covered by public or insurance funding are presented in Table 4. Austria Rotavirus vaccination was introduced into the national immuni sation programmes in 2007. Both RV1 and RV5 are being used in the country according to routine procurement practices . Optional, genotyping of rotavirus strains isolated from children with breakthrough infections is available . Belgium Rotavirus vaccination was recommended at national level in 2006 but is not included in the vaccination programmes at all regional level s. However, it is systematically offered (not free of charge, unlike other childhood vaccines) during preventive consultations organi sed by the government agency 'well -baby clinics' at regional le vel. Both RV1 and RV5 are used in the country. A network of laboratories is monitoring the number of stool samples sent for rotavirus diagnostics. Estonia Rotavirus vaccination was initiated in 2014. RV5 is currently used in the country . Finland Rotavirus vaccination was initiated in 2009. RV5 is currently used in the country . Germany Rotavirus vaccination was initiated in 2013. Both RV1 and RV5 are being used in the country. Rotavirus disease is notifiable in Germany. Greece Rotavirus vaccinat ion was initiated in 201 2. Rotavirus vaccination is only partially reimbursed. Both RV1 and RV5 are available in the country. Ireland Positive decision by national health authorities but no implementation yet. Italy Rotavirus vaccination was initiated in 2017. Both RV1 and RV5 are being used in the country according to routine procurement practices. Latvia Rotavirus vaccination was initiated in 2015. Both RV1 and RV5 are being used in the country.

Publication pending. SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 19 United Kingdom Rotavirus vaccination was initiated in 2013. RV1 is currently used in the country. Further more, it should be noted that rotavirus vaccine is being provided to additional European children through the private sector, this being more common in southern Europe than in other parts of Europe , based on vac cine distribution statistics. The main reasons for not including the rotavirus vaccine into the national routine paediatric programme investigated in the recent VENICE III survey (see footnote 11 above) were cost/cost -effectiveness ratio, insufficient anticipated epidemiological impact, and other competing health priorities. Other reasons mentioned included risk of emergence of serotypes not covered by the vaccine, improved clinical management preferred to vaccination, and concerns regarding safety (intuss usception). As of mid -2016, 81 countries worldwide had introduced rotavirus vaccines into their routine immunisation programme. Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 20 Table 4 .

Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 22 2. Method s The aim of this expert opinion is to provide EU/EEA Member States with relevant scientific information to support the decision -making process o n possible introduction and monitoring of routine vaccination to prevent rotavirus - induced gastroenteritis. The evidence presented in this docu ment are based on reviews of the published literature in scientific journals , grey literature and a search in the EMA Eudravigilance database for spontaneously reported cases of intussusception following rotavirus vaccination. The information collected summarises : burden of rotavirus disease in the EU/EEA in children under five years of age rotavirus vaccine efficacy in countries with low mortality due to rotavirus infections (hereafter referred to as 'low-mortality rotavirus countries') rotavirus vaccine effectiveness in low -mortality rotavirus countries herd protection provided by infant rotavirus vaccination in low -mortality rotavirus countries rotavirus vaccine safety in low cost-effectiveness using rotavirus vaccines in EU/EEA immunisation programmes attitudes to rotavirus vaccination among parents and healthcare workers . The literature searches were conducted by ECDC library staff in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases to collect relevant articles and systematic review s published in English between 1 January 1995 and 14 February 2014. Search strategies and results are available in Annex 4 and 5. The systematic searches were complemented by manual searches that included websites of public health institutes in the EU/EEA for current immuni sation schedules. An Endnote database was created and comple mented with references identified using all search strategies. Identified article titles with abstracts were reviewed by ECDC experts. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria taking into account the different search queries mentioned above, a second screening of selected full text articles was performed. A decision on study inclusion was made jointly by ECDC staff (consensus of at least two reviewers) . For each study included, i nformation on study design, number of participants, sampling and group allocation, intervention if relevant, outcomes, and study results was extracted and summari sed. All outcomes for which meta -analysis was conducted were dichotomous (occurrence of the ev ent or not , e.g. efficacy and effectiveness ). Methodology used for evaluatin g burden of severe rotavirus disease in EU/EEA Burden of severe rotavirus disease was defined as rotavirus disease leading to Belgium , etc.' and 'hospitalisation' were used to identify studies assessing burden of severe rotavirus disease and hosp italisation in infants. Results of the burden of disease studies were not appropriate for a meta -analysis since no uniform effect estimator was reported. Therefore , a descriptive summary of identified data is presented. Methodology used for evaluatin g rotavirus vaccine efficacy Since two recently published systematic reviews with meta -analyses were available and provided high -quality and sufficient information on all relevant efficacy outcomes, results from these reviews were used. The review published by the Cochrane Collaboration in 2012 and the German Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) in 2013 have both assessed relevant outcomes in randomi sed controlled trials (RCTs) conducted until 2011. No further RCTs have been conducted in rotavirus low -morta lity countries. Results from the systematic review and meta-analysis, conducted by STIKO, are presented in this expert opinion with permission . Methodology used for evaluatin g rotavirus vaccine effectiveness Rotavirus vaccine effectiveness was defined as the relative reduction in rotavirus disease risk for a specified end point : hospitali sation with regard to the rotavirus vaccination status of study subjects , based on odds ratio in case -control studies and re lative risk in cohort studies. Search terms such as 'rotavirus', 'rotavirus vaccine', 'immuni sation' and 'vaccine effectiveness' were used to identify studies that assessed effectiveness of rotavirus vaccines. Each study that was included in the final anal ysis was assigned an acronym consisting of the author of the primary publication, year of publication and vaccine brand tested. Case-control or cohort studies were included if effectiveness of either RV1 or RV 5 on at least one of the pre -defined patient - relevant outcomes was reported for healthy children <5 years of age from developed countries (Europe, Australia, Canada, USA, Latin America and Asia). Observational studies were excluded if a vaccine formulation was used that was different from the vaccines licensed in the EU/EEA and if there was concomitant administration with OPV since this is not current practice in SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 23 the EU/EEA. Data for both vaccines were pooled, as the objective of this expert opinion was to evaluate the effectiveness of rotavirus vaccin ation and not individual products. The final analysis presents pooled data for both vaccines. Meta-analyses of effectiveness data from included case -control and cohort studies were performed in relation to rotavirus vaccine status (at least two doses). Ex tracted data were entered into the computer software Review Manager (version 5.3, Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). Pooled estimates were calculated using random effects models. The dichotomous data were analysed by calculating Mantel -Haensel r andom effects risk ratios (RR) or odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for rotavirus vaccine recipients versus placebo recipients in the RCTs, or no vaccine in the observational studies. The pooled RR or were used to calcula te pooled vaccine effectiveness using the following formula: (1 -[Relative Risk or Odds Ratio]) x 100 (103). Judgement of the extent of heterogeneity was based on similarity of point estimates, extent of confidence interval overlap , and statistical criteria including tests of heterogeneity and I2 (104). Methodology used for evaluatin g rotavirus vaccine -induced herd protection Herd protection was defined as indirect protection of unvaccinated individuals in a population where rotavirus vaccination is recommended and used. The search terms 'rotavirus', 'vacci ne', 'immuni sation', 'herd assessing herd -immunity /herd protection induced by rotavirus vaccination in infants. Results of the herd protection studies are reported as descriptive summary of identified data as well as results from a meta -analysis . Methodology used for evaluatin g rotavirus vaccine safety Rotavirus vaccine safety was assessed by estimation of risk for development of specified end points in relation to the rotavirus vaccination status of study subjects. The outcomes assessed were vaccine -induced intussusception and Kawasaki disease, for which EMA had requested surveillance in their risk management plans. The risk window used in the RCTs varied but mos t post -marketing observational studies of intussusception utilised the Brighton Collaboration case definition levels 1 -4, i.e. a risk window within 21 days of vaccination (see Annex 2) (105). No similar generally agreed case definition was available for Kawasaki's disease at the time of studies but has been published subsequently (106). Since a recently published systematic review with meta -analysis was available and provided sufficient, high-quality information on all relevant safety outcomes in RCTs, results from this review w ere used. Th is Cochrane Collaboration review published in 2012 assessed relevant outcomes in randomi sed controlled trials (RCTs) conducted until 2011. No further RCTs have been conducted in rotavirus low -mortality countries. Following introduction of rotavirus vaccines into routine immuni sation pr ogrammes and the first vaccine safety signals, observational studies assessing safety have been conducted in rotavirus low -mortality countries (mainly non EU/EEA countries) . Results based on odds ratio s in case -control studies, relative risk in cohort studies, relative incidence in self - control case series and standardi sed morbidity ratio in one observed versus expected analysis were identified and are reported . The disease' identify studies that assessed safety of rotavirus vaccines. Observational studies were included if safety of either RV1 or RV 5 in relation to at least one of the pre -defined pa tient- relevant outcomes was reported for healthy children <5 years of age from rotavirus low -mortality countries (Europe, Australia, Canada, USA, Latin America and Asia). Only one smaller observational study from the EU/EEA using the observed versus expect ed methodology was identified. Observational studies were excluded if a vaccine formulation was used that was different from the vaccines licen sed in the EU/EEA and if there was concomitant administration with OPV since this is not current practice in the EU/EEA. A summary of identified studies are presented . Recently, a German group published a systematic review and meta -analysis of ten studies that all used the self -control case series methodology and obtained results on the outcome of intussusception risk related to age with rotavirus vaccination . Results from this systematic review have been included . In addition, since only one smaller observational study assessing int ussusception in the EU/EEA was available, information on intussusception cases spontan eously reported from EU/EEA M ember States to the Eudravigilance (EV) database was made available to the ECDC11 in accordance with EV access policy. The request was handled by EMA in accordance with the 'Rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on acces s to European Medicines Agency (EMA) documents' and 'EudraVigilance access polic y for medicines for human use' EMA/759287/2009). EMA provided line listings for case reports of in tussusception submitted during the time period from authoris ation of the two rotavirus vaccines i n 2006 until 1 July 2014. Data were partially redacted in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/ 2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protect ion of individuals with regard to the 11 N.B. The analysis and interpretation of Eudravigilance data presented in this expert opinion may n ot be understood or quoted as being made on behalf of the European Medicines Agency or any of its working parties. Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 24 processing of personal data by the Community instituti ons and bodies and on the free movement of such data. The information provided in the line listings was based on a query performed in EV using the following search criteria: all reports submitted as spo ntaneous to EV up to 1 July 2014, where Rotarix or Rotateq were report ed as a suspect or interacting medicinal product. Line listings of IS cases were analysed for number of cases by product, gender , age at vaccination, dose number in vaccine series, time to onset of IS from vaccinatio n and clinical outcome. Chart review of reported cases of IS to validate the diagnosis agai nst a common case definition was not possible due to country -specific and EU -level data protection laws. Number of vaccinated infants d uring the same time period is unknown but 9.7 million doses of RV1 an d 7.9 million doses of RV5 w ere distributed from the manufacturer . Methodology used for evaluatin g rotavirus vaccine cost - effectiveness in the EU/EEA Rotavirus vaccine cost -effectiveness studies were defined as evaluation of cost -effectiveness for introduction of these vaccines into national immuni sation name' were used to identify studies assessing cost -effectiveness o f rotavirus vaccination in infants. Results obtained in the s tudies were not appropriate for a meta -analysis due to diversity in assumptions and model structures. Therefore a descriptive summary of identified data is presented. Methodology used for evaluatin g attitudes to rotavirus vaccination Attitude was defined as 'parent s' and 'healthcare worker s' attitude s to identify studies assessing attitudes to rotavirus vaccination in infants. Results of the attitude studies were few an d not appropriate for meta -analysis since no uniform effect estimator was reported. Therefore a descriptive summary of identified data is presented. Expert panel opinion The opinion provided in this document is based on the identified evidence which was evaluat ed by a group of independent EU /EEA experts. Scientific articles were summari sed and discussed in two meetings and a series of telephone conferences. Experts were also able to provide additional relevant literature. Further more, based on the literature review, the experts suggested options for relevant data which could be obtain ed by Member States before i ncluding r otavirus vaccin ation in a routine paediatric immuni sation programme . They also suggested indicators which could be followed after implementation to facilitate evaluation of impact of vaccination and identified knowledge gaps are discussed. The EU e xperts were selected based on the following criteria: experience in running and evaluating national routine immuni sation programmes for ch ildren ; experience in evaluating scientific evidence addressing vaccine safety, efficacy, effectiveness, and cost - effectiveness ; experience in issuing national recommendations for new vaccines to be included in routine immuni sation programmes . Panel members' declarations of interest were reviewed by ECDC and no potential conflict s of interest were found that could influence the work of the panel. Updated Expert Opinion following ECDC Advisory forum review and public consultation In 2016 and 2017, t he Expert Opinion and its scientific advice was subject to discussion in ECDC 's Advisory Forum with a round of public consultation in between . Following the public consultation procedure, n ine responses with comments and suggestions for edits were received f rom a variety of stakeholders including EU/EEA Member State Ministries of Health, EU/EEA Member State Public Health Agencies, members of the academic community in EU/EEA Member States , WHO 's Regional Office for Europe and the two vaccine manufacturers. The Expert Opinion was subsequently updated and ECDC's response s to the comments and suggestions provided during the consultation procedure are published in a separate document on ECDC 's website. The final Expert Opinion was endorsed by the Advisory Forum in May 2017. SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 25 3. Results Burden of rotavirus disease in EU/EEA countries A number of prospective and retrospective epidemiological studies published between 1995 and 2014 described country - specific burden of rotavirus disease in eighteen EU/EEA Member Stat es (13, 107-137). Most studies focus ed on describing severe rotavirus disease and address ed the burden of hospitalisation (see Table 5). A limited number of European studies address ed deaths , the most severe outcome of rotavirus disease , nosocomial infections and burden in out-patient facilities. Hospital admissions In the EU/EEA, all 4 9 studies identified from eighteen M ember States report ed that rotavirus is the most common pathogen isolated from children hospitali sed with AGE. The contribu tion of rotavirus as a cause of acute gastroenteritis in hospitalised children < 5 years of age varied between years and between countries , ranging from 26 to 69% (see Table 5). The reasons for this wide range is not entirely clear , however there are probably some seasonal fluctuations. Methods used for diagnostics (antigen -detection and more recently PCR) and differences in surveillance in Member States may also influence results. The number of children hospitali sed per year also differs significantl y; from 100 in Spain to 1 190 in Ireland per 100 000 children less than five years of age. However , in a majority of countries around 300 -600 cases per 100 000 children <5 years are hospitali sed per year (see Table 5). In a review performed by WHO Regional Office for Europe hospital admission rates were similar across country income groups (medians 200, 280, 420 and 190/100 000 per year in low -, lower -middle -, upper -middle - and high -income countries in 49/52 WHO European Region countries, respectively) (6)]. The median duration of hospitali sation for rotavirus disease varied in the EU/EEA studies, ranging from 1.3 days in one study conducted in nation -wide registries in Norway (127) to 9.5 days in one study hospital in Poland (128). The duration of hospitali sation may also vary within c ountries , as observed in Italy (see Table 5). By way of international comparison, studies among US children aged <5 years have shown that rotaviruses accounted for 30 -50% of all hospitali sations for gastroenteritis and approximately 70% of hospitali sations for gastroenteritis during the seasonal peaks (138, 139). The US CDC researchers further estimated that in the first five years of life, four out of five children in the United States will develop a symptomati c rotavirus disease , one in seven will require a clinic or emergency department visit, and one in 70 will be hospitalised (3). The need for intensive care in the EU/EEA setting has been evaluated in several studies. One study conducted in Sweden suggests 1 -2% of hospitalised children with rotavirus disease appear to be in need of intensive care, often due to very severe dehydration (> 10% of body weight) (15). In a prospective study by the German Paediatric Surveillance Unit, assessing children with very severe rotavirus disease12 , 101 cases were identified during a two-year period (140). Based on this the annual incidence of very severe rotavirus disease was estimated at 1.2 per 100 000 (95% CI 0.9 - 1.4/100 000). Among the 101 children, 48 of the children were in need of intensive care, 12 suffered from necroti sing enterocolitis, and 58 had signs of encephalopathy. Deaths Five studies were identified addressing rotavirus -disease -associated deaths in the EU/EEA (6, 109, 141-143). Using an adaptation of the U.S. CDC mortality model for Europe, an estimate was made of the number of RV - associated deaths in children <5 years of approximately 200 deaths per annum (143). This study has been criticised for over -estimating the mortality rate, as indicated by country -specific data presented below. A study from the UK using national statistic al report s from two different sources indicates 3.3 and 3.8 deaths per year in children < 5 years of age due to rotavirus disease, suggesting a mortality rate of <0.1 per 100 000 children <5 years of age and a hospital case -fatality rate of around 0.2% (141). A study from German y, suggests a hospital case -fatality rate of 0.1% during a 10 -year period of surveillance (142). Additional data from Germany reveal that 1 -2 deaths due to rotavirus disease are reported each year in children <5 years of age13. Czech Republic reported three deaths in children <2 years over a nine -year period of surveillance but interestingly also reported three deaths in elderly people related to rotavirus disease outbreaks in retirement homes (109). Finally , in a study from the Netherlands R V-related mortality was determined for all children who had died within three weeks of confirmed RV infection between 2000 and 2006 (144). Seven deaths were id entified. All seven had 12 defined as in need of intensive care treatment, or hyper - or hyponatremia (>155 mmol/L or < 125 mmol/L), or clinical signs of encephalopathy (somnolence, seizures or apnoea) or RV -associated deaths 13 http://www.rki.de/ Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 26 congenital pathology and two patients also had a history of low birth weight . One child died before 2 months of age, the remaining six children died between 2 and 14 months of age. In a review from 2009 of 49/52 countries of the WHO European Region , using published literature or WHO data sources , rotavirus disease caused an estimated 6 550 deaths (range 5 671-8 989) and 146 287 (range 38 374- 1 039 843) hospital admissions each year in children aged <5 years (6). Seven countries, mostly in the low - and lower -middle -income groups, accounted for 93% of estimated deaths. In total, t hree EU Member States - Slovakia, Bulgaria and Slovenia - reported mortalit y data as part of this review . Bulgaria and Slovenia did not report any deaths, while Slovakia reported a mortality rate of 0.1 per 100 000 children . By way of international comparison, r esearchers from US CDC estimated in a study that one in 200 000 children would die each year in the US from rotavirus disease (3). Nosocomial infections Evaluating the burden of intra -healthcare -acquired rotavirus disease suggest s that up to ~25-30% of rotavirus infections diagnosed in hospitalised children may be due to rotavirus infections acquired within the healthcare system (27, 29, 145-153). Nosocomial rotavirus infections often occur in younger children than the community - acquired rotavirus infections, a nd fewer complications develop (136, 154). Further more, nosocomial infections often develop in children with underlying chronic diseases spending time in hospital settings where rotavirus is easily transmitted. In a German study assessing cases hospitalised during 2002-2008, 14% of reporte d cases were nosocomial (155). A five-year (2006 -2010) Polish study suggested that the mean proportion of nosocomial rotavirus disease among all hospitalised rotavirus infected cases was 24% (156)]. A Spanish study report ed an incidence of 59.0 nosocomial cases per 100 000 children <5 years of age during 1998-2007(154). Another longitudinal prospective study in paedia tric in -patients 0 -48 months old in Austria, Germany and Switzerland suggest ed that almost one third of nosocomial cases occurred in infants aged two months or younger (149)]. In a review of n osocomial rotavirus disease in European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom) rotaviruses were found to be the major cause of paediatric nosocomial dia rrhoea (ranging from 31 to 87%) (27) and in a recent meta -analysis of twenty surveillance studies of nosocomial rotavirus disease , an adjusted year -round incidence of 0.7 (95% CI 0.0 -1.8) per 100 hospitalisations was calculated for children under five years (157). Highes t nosocomial rotavirus infection incidence rate was found in children <2 years of age, hospitalised during the epidemic months (8.1/100 hospitalisations 95% CI 6.4 -9.9). The authors conclude that nosocomial rotavirus infections are an important problem for those children affected and for the quality of the healthcare systems.

The large number of children being assessed in outpatient settings ( emergen cy departments or primary care) do contribute to the significant burden of rotavirus disease on the healthcare syste ms and societal costs (112, 135, 168-170). The burden of rotavirus disease in the outpatient setting was estimated in the REVEAL study and was observed to be 2-4 times higher than the incidence o f children hospitalis ations due to rotavirus disease (13). Conclusions Epidemiological studies conducted in eighteen EU/EEA M ember States suggest that acute rotavirus disease results in around 300-600/100 000 children under five years of age being hospitalis ed annu ally, however significant variation occurs within and between countries. Extrapolating these data to the whole EU/EEA with a birth cohort of around 5 million infants suggests that about 75 000-150 000 hospitalisations in children <5 years occur yearly . Further epidemiological studies in ten EU/EEA M ember States suggest that around two to four t imes more children seek medical evaluation for dehydration in outpatient settings, leading to significant burden on healthcare systems . Finally, limited mortality due to rotavirus disease is reported in studies conducted in eight EU/EEA M ember States. An estimated mortality rate of <0.1 per 100 000 children <5 years and a hospital case -fatality rate of around 0.1-0.2% is reported . Identified knowledge gaps and need s for capacity building No case definition for disease surveillance of rotavirus disease exists in most EU/EEA countries and at the EU level. Development and adoption of a suitable case definition would facilitate impact assessment of implemented rotavirus immuni sation pr ogrammes . Rotavirus disease is notifiable disease in most EU/EEA Member States , with the exception of Germany . Initiation of EU/EEA M ember State and EU -level routine or sentinel reporting of severe rotavirus disease leading to hospitalisation and/or death would facilitate impact assessment of implemented rotavirus immuni sation programmes. SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 29 Rotavirus vaccine efficacy The first randomised placebo -controlled clinical trials that served as the basis for licensure in the EU/EAA are briefly described below (83, 171, 172). Subsequently 41 randomised placebo -controlled clinical trials were reviewed by the Cochrane Collaboration (173). RV1. A large randomised placebo -controlled clinical trial to evaluate efficacy of RV1 was conducted in Finland and 11 Latin American countries (171). The study was designed to evaluate safety with respect to intussusception (n=63 225), and to evaluate efficacy of the vaccine in reducing the need for hospitalisation related to rotavirus disease . The efficacy evaluated in 17 867 infants (n=9 009 in the rotavirus vaccine recipient group) against severe rotavirus disease was 84.7% [95% CI: 71.7-92.4] during 79% [95% CI: 66.4 -87.4] during the second y ear of life. Serotype -specific rate reductions against severe rotavirus disease were -81.5-85.6]. In addition, studies involving 3 994 infants (n=2 572 in the rotavirus vaccine group) were conducted in six European countries and showed that after two doses of Rotarix, the vaccine efficacy estimated for the period between two weeks post -second dose and the end of two consecutive rotavirus seasons (combined efficacy follow -up period; mean duration 17 months) was 83.8% [95% CI: 76.8 - 88.9] aga inst disease . Finally, 3 -year effica cy estimated in Asia (Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) was 100% [95%CI 67 - 100] (174). In this study against genotype G1 was 100.0% placebo -controlled trial was carried out to assess efficacy of RV5 with subjects < 8 weeks of age from 11 countries including USA, several Latin American countries, Taiwan and Europe (Finland, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Sweden) (83). The study was designed to evaluate safety with respect to intussusception, and efficacy of the vaccine in reducing the need for hospitalisation and emergenc y department visits related to rotavirus disease . Sub- studies nested within the large -scale study were designed to evaluate safety with respect to all adverse events , as well as immunogeni city and efficacy against rotavirus disease of any severity. Efficacy was evaluated in 68 038 infants (n=34 035 in the rotavirus vaccine group) and serotype -specific reduction in rotavirus disease was evaluated in a subset of 5 673 infants (n=2 834 in the group) . The RV5 vaccine reduced hospitali sations and emergency department related disease by 94.5% [95% CI efficacy against any G1 - G4 rotavirus disease through out the first rotavirus season after vaccination was 74% [95% -100]. disease caused by G1 -G4 during the second rotavirus season after vaccination was 8 8% [95% CI: for severe disease and 62.6% [95% CI: 44.3-75.4] for disease of any severity. The duration of protection after a complete vaccination series has not been studied beyond the third season after vaccination and , according to manufacture rs, it will not be since studies have been closed (175, 176). An extension study conducted in Finland, where 21 941 children were followed for up to 3.1 years after the third vaccine dose of RV5 , revealed rate reductions in hospitali sations and emergency room visits during the first, second and third years of life by 94.0% (95% [201]. this study the serotype -specific rate reductions in rotavirus disease healthcare encounters ( ED-visits and hospitalisations) in the per protocol -99.8). It is expected that reinfection with naturally circulating wild - type rotavirus will boost the immune response in vaccinated individuals since vaccination will not induce sterilising immunity. It is therefore essential that effectiveness and possible breakthrough infections are monitored. A systematic Cochrane review published in 2012 evaluated 41 randomised controlled trials assessing efficacy of rotavirus vaccines with 186 263 participants (173). The trials compared a rotavirus vaccine with placebo, no intervention or another va ccine. The vaccines tested were RV1 (29 trials involving 101 671 participants) and RV5 (12 trials involving 84 592 participants). The large trials were conducted in low and high rotavirus -mortality settings throughout the world. They showed that in the fir st two years of life, RV1 and RV5 prevented more than 80% of severe cases of rotavirus diarrhoea in low -mortality developed countries.

Figure 6 presents the results obtained in the revi ew of efficacy studies conducted in Europe, Australia, Canada, USA, Latin America and Asia , indicating a vaccine efficacy of 92% (95% CI 82 -96%) against rotavirus - induced hospitalisation during the first and second year following vaccination as well as 74% (95%CI 61 -83%) against any rotavirus infection during the same time period . Cross -protection against other genotypes Cross-protection has been shown for both vaccines against the five most common genotypes (see above), which is expected si nce antibodies to the common antigen VP6 have been shown in animal experiments to provide protection. However, the number of cases with G2P4 has been very limited in the RCTs assessing RV1 and the confidence intervals are wide. Effectiveness has been demon strated for RV1 also against the less common genotypes G9P[4]and G9P [6] and for RV5 and G12. Further more, there are no data available on new emerging genotypes such as G8, and G10. None of the se have so far been able to induce larger outbreaks in Europe or the US to enable the evaluat ion of cross-protective immunity. However, studies performed in Africa and South East Asia indicate statistically significant cross -protection for at least one of the genotypes G8 (101, 179). Conclusions A Cochrane systematic review and meta -analysis published in 2012, evaluat ing 41 randomised controlled trials with 186 263 participants , showed that in the first two years of life, the second generation rotavirus vaccines RV1 and RV5 prevented more than 80% of severe cases of rotavirus diarrhoea in low -mortality de veloped countries . A German systematic review and meta -analysis of RCTs conducted (published in 2013 ) suggest s a vaccine efficacy of 92% against rotavirus -induced hospitalisation during the first two years following vaccination (95% CI 82 -96%) as well as 7 4% (95%CI 61 -83%) against any rotavirus infection. Identified knowledge gaps and needs for capacity building Vaccine e fficacy data are limited in low -mortality rotavirus settings for cases induced by new emerging rotavirus genotypes such as G8 and G10. Preparedness to conduct o bservational effectiveness studies should be established should new emerging genotype /s cause larger outbreaks in the EU/EEA . Vaccine e fficacy data are missing in chronically ill individuals and those with gastrointestinal malformati ons. Observational studies can fill these gaps. SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 31 Rotavirus vaccine effectiveness As of mid -2016, 81 countries worldwide ha d introduced rotavirus vaccines into their routine immunisation programme (180). Vaccine effectiveness has been assessed for the two ro tavirus vaccines in observational studies conducted in rotavirus low -mortality settings in Australia, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Spain and the USA. Not all these countries have introduced rotavirus vaccination in their national immuni sation programmes, such as France and Spain. In contrast to efficacy assessed in randomised controlled trials by administering vaccines and observing outcomes under controlled conditions in a cohort of healthy participants, vaccine effectiveness is assessed in t he general population after the vaccine went into widespread use. Despite the inherent weaknesses of their study design, observational studies can provide important additional evidence on the effects of the vaccine including population -effects (such as her d protection ); outcomes in population groups not included in the randomi sed clinical trials (e.g. chronically ill), and outcomes which are rare in developed countries, such as rotavirus -induced deaths. We identified a total of 19 articles reporting results from either case -control (n=15) or cohort studies (n=4) conducted in low rotavirus -mortality countries (181-196). Studies were conducted between 2010 and 2013 and assessed effectiveness over 2-3 winter seasons. Case -control studies conducted in low rotavirus -mortality settings Pooled crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) from the 15 case -control studies showed that rotavirus vaccination is effective in preventing rotavirus -induced gastroenteritis requiring hospitalisation in low rotavirus -mortality settings . A forest plot with adjusted results is presented in Figure 7. After at least two doses of rotavirus vaccine, pooled vaccine effectiveness to prevent severe rotavirus -induced gastroenteritis lea ding to hospitali 84% (95% CI 75 -89%) (181-192, 197). Pooled ORs were homogenous and consistent. This analysis suggests that rotavirus -vaccination is also effective in the general paediatr ic population. Figure 7.

Pooled effectiveness was estimated at 91% (95% CI 88 -94%) (see Figure 8). It should be noted that there was greater heterogeneity among the cohort studies than the case -control studies.

Forest plot of pooled risk ratios for the occurrence of hospitalisation due to rotavirus disease in fully rotavirus -vaccination children, as observed in cohort studies published between 2007 and 2011 * * X-axis in log scale Effectiveness in high rotavirus -mortality settings Whether rotavirus vaccines will provide protection against severe rotavirus disease caused by rotavirus strains that did not circulate during the clinical trials conducted in Europe, Australia and North America has been addressed in vaccine efficacy and effectiveness studies from Brazil (RV1), Nicaragua (RV5) South Africa (RV1), Malawi (RV 5), Kenya (RV5) and Ghana (RV 1 and 5) (101, 198-201). Efficacy and e ffectiveness reported from these high rotavirus -mortality countries is somewhat lower in the low -mortality countries , but still significant, taking into account effects on both mortality and morbidity (101, 179, 198, 199). The study from Brazil (198) demonstrates rather high vaccine effectiveness of RV1 against fully heterotypic circulating strains, but the authors discuss the possibility of a more rapid decline of protective i mmunity against heterotypic strains. Of interest is also a recent RCT conducted in rural Ghana, where three doses of RV 1 was compared to two doses, and resulted in increased seroconversion frequencies and geometric antibody titers (201). However, since there is no correlate of protection, a postmarketing effectiveness study is required to determine whether the improvement in immune response from three doses of RV1 translates into a public health benefit in high rotavirus -mortality settings. The first effectiveness study conducted in South Africa with broader range of circulating rotavirus strains has been published and this also includes some children who are HIV-positive (202). South Africa introduced rotavirus vaccine into its routine immuni sation program me in August 2009 and it is administered at six and 14 weeks of age. Extrapolation of these studies to the European paediatric populatio n may not be valid and effectiveness studies , including less frequently circulating rotavirus strains in European vaccinated settings , are warranted. In order to obtain statistically -testable estimates , large paediatric populations need to be followed, which suggests that cross - country border collaborations may be more valuable than country -specific studies. Other studies of interest Initial effectiveness data assessing reduction in mortality , available from Mexico after introduction of rotavirus vaccine in their routine programme in 2007 , suggest a 66% relative reduction in overall diarrhoea -related deaths in children <1 year of age compared with baseline years (2003 -2006) (203). Continued monitoring reveals that trends in hospitalis ation and deaths from diarrh oea among children younger than 5 years in Mexico before and 7 years after implementation of rotavirus vaccination reveals a 53% reduction (95% confidence interval deaths and 5831 hospitali sations averted every year (204). An observational cohort study conducted in the US investigated whether rotavirus vaccination prevent s a known complication associated with rotavirus disease , seizures (205). A full-course of rotavirus vaccination was statistically associated with an 18 -21% reduction in the risk of seizure requiring hospitali sation or emergency room attention (RR 0.79 95% CI 71-88) in the year following vaccination. Subsequently, several investigators have confirmed the reduction in hospitalisation due to febrile seizures (206-208). Data on l ong-term vaccine effectiveness beyond the first three years of life in vaccinated individuals after i ntroduction of rotavirus vaccines in paediatric rou tine immuni sation programmes and in vaccinated populations are starting to become available . In a Finnish test-negative case-control study effectiveness of RV5 was evaluated over four rotavirus seasons and continued to show significant reduction: the crude estimate of the effectiveness of RV5 to prevent RV GE hospitali sation in national immuni programme 98.4%) Of note, vaccine -derived rotaviruses were of the children with rotavirus -induced gastroenteritis , with a probable causal association in 2 children as assessed by the investigators . In addition, in repeated surveys in one paediatric Finnish hospital t he proportion of RVGE among all children with acute gastroenteritis cases decreased from 5 2% (421 of 809 cases) in pre -introduction of vaccine years to 2 6% (86 of 330 cases) in post - introduction of v accine (years 2009 to 2011 ) and then falling to 12% (40 of 347 cases) in 2012 and 2014 (210). The hospitalis ations for RVGE were reduced by 90% and the outpatient clinic visits also by 90% in years 2012-2014. All acute SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 33 gastroenteritis cases were reduced by 59% in this study and norovirus was the major causative agent of acute gastroenteritis identified in the post -introduction period . However, p ersistent rotavirus circulation was observed six years post-introduction of vaccine in laboratory -investigated older children and elderly with acu te gastroenteritis (211). Further long-term studies of RV1 and RV5 in the US revealed s tatistically significant vaccine effectiveness for each year of life for which su fficient data allowed analysis which was 7 years for RV5 and 3 years for RV1 (212). Both vaccines provided statistically significant genotype -specific protection against predominant circulating rotavirus strains. As observed above , it is expected that rotaviruses will continue to circulate in Europe and provide a natural immunity boost to vaccinated individuals. Therefore the ultimate outcome of introduc ing rotavirus vaccines is containment and not elimination/eradication. Conclusion s Protection by the two rotavirus vaccines , RV1 and RV5, against severe rotavirus disease leading to hospitalisation, was assessed in observational studies conducted in rotavirus low -mortality and developed countries , including : Australia and Au US (RV1 and RV5). A meta -analysis of identified case control studies suggests a vaccine effectiveness against severe rotavirus disease leading to hospitalisation of 84% (95% CI 75 -89%) and a meta - analysis of identified cohort studies suggests a vaccine effectiveness of 91% (95% CI 88 -94%). Identified knowledge gaps and needs for capacity building Whether current rotavirus vaccines administered during the first six months of life will provide life -long protection against severe rotavirus disease is unknown and needs to be monitored. Routine surveillance for fully immuni sed and hospitalised children with breakthrough , laboratory -confirmed rotavirus disease infections is a possible strategy. No known serological surrogate marker for correlates of protective immunity is available, although serum IgA has been u sed in the RCTs and could possibly be explor ed as another tool for monitor ing the long -term response in sero -epidemiological studies . Whether current rotavirus vaccines will provide protective immunity to new emerging rotavirus strains in the EU/EEA setting is unknown and needs to be monitored through routine or sentinel rotavirus strain surveillance in the EU/EEA , and through observational studies should outbreaks occur. Herd protection provided by infant rotavirus vaccination The main aim for vaccines is t o provide direct protection to immuni sed individuals. In addition, indirect protection of unvaccinated individuals may be observed and may add to the impact achieved through population -wide vaccination programmes. Possible mechanisms behind indirect effect s may include transmission of vaccine virus to unimmuni sed individuals inducing protective immunity, or reduced virus circulation/number of asymptomatic carriers in a defined population through high vaccination coverage with vaccines that induce sterile im munity or significantly lower virus excretion. Such indirect effects are often called herd, population or community immunity/protection and are beneficial to individuals unable to be vaccinated due to contraindications. Herd protection may be demonstrated through detection of a level of protection higher than expected from vaccine coverage achieved, or by observing any level of protection in unimmuni sed subjects (205, 213, 214). The level of immuni sation coverage required in a define d population for indirect protection to become evident varies with disease and its corresponding vaccine. One importan t factor for consideration when looking at the possibility of rotavirus vaccine -induced herd protection is that catch-up campaigns of old er age groups have not been possible due to the narrow age window for vaccination recommended by regulatory agencies to minimi se risk of intussusception (1, 2). Hence, population protection to rotaviruses is either acquired through natural infection or vaccination of young infants. Rotaviru s vaccine viruses are known to be shed after vaccination with both RV1 and RV5. A randomi sed placebo - controlled clinical trial evaluating transmission of RV1 vaccine virus among twins living in the Dominican Republic showed that transmission of the vaccine strain occurred, from a vaccinated to an unvaccinated twin living in close contact , but whether transmission leads to indirect protection is still unknown (71). Seroconversion occurred in the vaccinated twin in 62.5% (95% CI 51.0 -73.1) and in 21.3% (12.9 -31.8) of the unvaccinated twins. Transmission of vaccine virus to siblings of RV5 va ccinated infants ha s also been described and resulted in limited clinical symptoms (80, 215). A mathematical transmission model to project the impact of a rotavirus vaccination programme at the population level was developed by Van Effelterre et al (216). The model was applied to five European countries using different expected vaccination coverage rates; 70%, 90% and 95%. According to the model, herd immunity would induce a reduction of any severity of rotavirus disease incidence by 25%, 22% and 20%, respectively, for the different levels of vaccine coverage and for moderate -to-severe rotavirus disease by 19%, 15% and 13% five years after implementation of a vaccine programme. These reduction s are additional effects, on top the direct effect. In addition to the observed direct effect, a number of effectiveness studies conducted in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, El Salvador , Mex ico, Panama and the United States also suggest an indirect effect of the second generation rotavirus vaccines , implying that herd protection may occur also in older age groups (108, 193, 197, 203, 217-242). Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 34 Further more, Pollard et al. recently conducted a meta -analysis to estimate the herd protection effect in children aged under one year in studies published between 2008 and 2014 (108, 193, 197, 203, 217-238, 243). The meta -analysis of studies conducted in low -mortality rotavirus countries reporting on rotavirus -specific gastroenteritis outcome s a median herd rotavirus -specific gastroenteritis morbidity/mortality of 22% (19 -25%) for 12 study years presented in five studies [(195, 197, 225, 237, 238). Finally, first data on herd protection in older age groups ha ve become available from a developing country using a time- series analysis conducted in Rwanda. T he greatest effect was recorded in children age -eligible to be vaccinated, but the authors also noted a decrease in the proportion of children with diarrhoea tes ting positive for rotavirus in almost every age group <5 years and eligible for the study (244). Conclusions Observational effectiveness studies suggest that herd protection in children of the s ame age group , as well as older age groups , evolve after vaccination. Herd protection may contribute significantly to the overall impact of rotavirus vaccination programmes . Identified knowledge gaps and needs for capacity building Whether rotavirus vaccin e virus excreted by newly vaccinated infants and transmitted to older populations will have any clinical impact for induction or maintenance of immunity , as natural disease has done, is unknown and needs to be investigated further . Whether reduced circulation of rotavirus disease in the community will reduce burden of disease in other age groups, particularly in the elderly , is unknown and needs to be monitored. Rotavirus vaccine safety Severe gastroenteritis with vaccine viral shedd ing in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency Post-authorisation spontaneous adverse event reports of severe gastroenteritis and chronic viral shedding in infants later diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) were received in countri es that first introduced rotavirus vaccines. Immunodeficienc ies have often not been diagnosed at the time in life when rotavirus vaccines are administered. In many of the EU/EEA countries r otavirus vaccines are the only live vaccines recommended for all infants. BCG is recommended to all children in 10 EU/EEA Member States and to children with increased risk for acquiring tuberculosis in all others . A review conducted in U.S. VAERS using MedDRA terms such as 'combined immunodeficiency ' or 'SCID' or 'combine d immunodeficiency ' from 3 February 2006 to 15 January 2010 following rotavirus vaccination (RV1 and RV5) identified nine reports of SCID and rotavirus vaccination [(72). All infants but one presented to the healthcare system with symptoms including diarrhoea and were hospitali sed. Subsequent investigations led to a diagnosis of SCID. R otavirus diagnostics of stool samples w ere positive in all nine cases and the virus was identified as the vaccine strain in six cases. Prolonged viral shedding was documented in five cases. No deaths were reported. Subsequently, EMA a nd other global regulatory agencies approved a labelling change in the SPC for the two (RV1 and RV5) vaccines contraindicating administration to individuals with a history of SCID (see Table 1 'Rotavirus vaccine contents, indications, contraindications, route of administr ation, dose regimens and frequency of reported undesirable effect s' and Section 'Vaccination of infants with immunodeficiency and immunodeficient close contacts ' above ). Early identification of SCID (e.g. new -born screening) could prevent inadvertent live rotavirus vaccine administration (245, 246). More recently RV1 vaccine strains have been identified in stool samples collected in the E uroRotaNet network14 in participating centres in the UK following the introduction of r otavirus vaccination and RV5 vaccine strains have been identified in immunocompetent children up to 3 -6 months following vaccination and further investigations are underway (247). 14 http:// www.eurorota.net SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 35 Intussusception Disease Intussusception (IS) is a condition characterised by telescoping of the intestine onto itself. Intussusception commonly occurs at the ileo -cecal junction (see Figure 9). Figure 9. Schematic overview of the most common form of intussusception (when ileum e nters cecum) and its common treatment s with air/barium enema. NB. Other types of intussusception are known to occur, such as when a part (the intussusceptum) of the ileum or jejunum prolapses into itself. The incidence is about twice as high in male infants as female infants. IS can be treated by air/barium enema (see Figure 9) or, if necessary , manual reduction during surgery. However, treatment traditions vary within the EU/EEA and in some EU/EEA Member States or regions surgery may be the first treatment option . According to a recent review , 77% of treatments provided in Europe are by air/barium enema (248). There is a n approximately 50% chance of success with a non -surgical reduction if it is initiated within 24 -48 hours from onset of symptoms. In a review of a n IS case series, presence of reported symptoms for at least two days before hospital admission was an independent predictor of the need for surgical reduction (adjusted odds ratio 2.7 95% CI 1.5 -4.8) (249). If not repaired or repaired late, entrapment will lead to intestinal wall oedema , possibly followed by necrosis and intestinal perforation. The latter leads to fever, peritonitis, septicaemia, shock and, if not reversed, death. Moreover, in the above -mentioned case series fever at admission was noted to significantly increase risk for need of surgical reduc tion (adjusted odds ratio 2.7, 95% CI 1.2 -6.0). Mortality due to intussusception is very rare in developed countries , estimated in the US at 2.1 per 1 million live births [(250). The EU/EEA studies mentioned below confirm that mo rtality is very rare. The pathogen esis of intussusception is not fully understood. IS may occur in any child, although a few gastrointestinal malformations are known to induce intussusceptions, such as polyps, which are often referred to as a 'lead point'. Structural lead points were identified in 3% in a systematic review of IS cases reported in the WHO European region from 1995 onwards (251). In this review recurrence was reported in approximately 1 in 10 IS patients and only one death was reported. A few studies have identified the presence of wild -type rotavirus in the stool or intestine of infants with intussusception; however this association seems uncommon , while adenovirus was strongly associated (OR 44 reported from Australia) (252, 253). Background i ncidence of IS in the EU/EEA Eight European countries have assessed background incidence for intussusception in preparation for rotavirus vaccine introduction (251, 254-262), see Table 6. The background incidence varies somewhat between countries, ranging between 24 and 66 per 100 000 but not to the extent observed in other parts of the world ( see p.38). In addition, variation may be observed between studies conducted in the same country dependent on whether validation according to the established Brighton Collaboration criteria (105) was conducted or not as in the case of the United Kingdom when the study from 2013 only accepted validated cases and observed a lower incidence than presented earlier ( Table 6) (105, 255).

Interestingly, the peak in Germany was noted to occur at the age of 180 to 269 days while in the United Kingdom (England) the peak was noted to be earlier, in infants aged 120 -149 days (see Table 7). The reason for such differences is un known. Table 7. Incidence of intussusception by month, first year of life assessed in two EU/EEA countries before rotavirus vaccination Germany Age/incidence per 100 000 (95% CI) (251) United Kingdom (England) Age/incidence per 100 000 (95% CI) (256) 0-89 days 19.2 (12.5 -30.4) 0-29 (4.0 -23.5) Few studies have assessed the treatment needed to resolve IS before rotavirus vaccine introduction. In a Swiss study including 288 IS cases , confirmed with the Brighton Collaboration standardi sed case definition, spontaneous devagination occurred in 38 patients, enemas reduced IS successfully in 183 cases, while surgical treatment was required in 67 cases. In this series of cases all patients recovered without sequelae (260, 264). Management practices have also been mapped in the United Kingdom and Ireland (264). In a recently published international literature review the global intussusception incidence was estimated at 74 per 100 000, peaking at 3 -9 months (248) (see Figure 10). However the variation was significant , with the lowest incidence of 9 per 100 000 reported from Bangladesh compared to 328 per 100 000 reported from South Korea. SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 37 Figure 10. Global annual incidence of intussusception by month of life during first year of life Global a nnual incidence <1 year of age estimated to 74 per 100 000 Source: (248) Intussusception following vaccination with first generation of oral live rotavirus vaccine An earlier , now withdrawn, US -licensed rotavirus vaccine RRV -TV (Rotashield) in 1998 -1999 in the US routine immuni sation programme was associated with an estimated excess risk of one additional case of intussusception (IS) per 4 670 to 9 474 infants vaccinated (11 -21 additional cases per 100 000 vaccinees) (61, 62). Regulatory agencies such as EMA and FDA therefore requested clinical tria ls for new second generation oral live attenuated rotavirus vaccines (RV1 and RV5) large enough to be able to exclude the risk of one additional case of IS per 10 000 children (the definition for a very rare adverse event) and > 60 000 children were include d in the randomised clinical trials conducted. Of particular interest are the results from investigations that followed the use of RRV -TV and the contributing role of age to development of intussusception. No child receiv ing dose 1 of RRV -TV before the age of 89 days developed intussusception, in spite of 1 935 doses be ing administered to infants younger than 30 days and 69 123 doses administered to infants aged 30-59 days (265). However , it should be noted that naturally occurring IS, although rare , does occur in the very young (see Table 7). The biological mechanism behind development of IS following RRV -TV vaccination is not yet fully understood. No increased risk of intussusception with second generation of oral live rotavirus vaccines (RV1 and RV5) in pre -authorisation randomised c ontrolled trials The risk of intussusception was evaluated in RV1 recipients in a randomi sed double blind placebo -controlled clinical trial conducted in Latin America and Finland w ith 63 225 children enrolled. This trial provided evidence of no increased r isk of intussusception in the RV1 group (n=31 673) receiving dose 1 at 6 -13 weeks of age when compared to the placebo group (n=31 552) within 31 days after each vaccine dose (171). The median age at study entry was 8.2 + 2.39 weeks. The relative risk (RR) for intussusception post dose 1 was calculated to be 0.50 (95% CI 0.07 -3.80) and post dose 2 was 0.99 (95% CI 0.31 -3.21). Similarly, the risk of intussusception was evaluated in RV5 recipients in a randomi sed double blind placebo -controlled study in 6 -12 week old infants (83). The median age at study entry was 10 weeks. During the combined 42 -day period following each dose, there were six cases of intussusception in 34 837 RV5 recipients compared with five cases in 34 788 placebo recipients. The relative risk (RR) for intussusception was calculated as 0.8 (95% CI 0.22 -3.52). No clustering of cases was identified in the early peri od after each dose with either vaccine or placebo (171, 172). In conclusion, in the pre -authorisation trials which served as the basis for vaccine authorisation in the EU /EEA, no increased risk of intussusception was observed in recipients of either rotavirus vaccine, RV1 or RV5, compared to the placebo groups. This was also the conclu sion in a Cochrane systematic review published in 2012 (173). However, a risk of I S lower than one additional case per 10 000 vaccinated individuals could not be excluded in the conducted trials and further post - licensure monitoring of intussusception was required by the European Medicines Agency in the risk management plans for both va ccines. Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 38 Assessment of reports of intussusception following routine use of second generation oral live rotavirus vaccines (RV1 and RV5) through adverse event spontaneous reporting systems Cases of intussusception in temporal relationship with the receipt of rotavirus vaccines w ere documented in the routine monitoring systems of adverse events following immuni sation in Australia, Brazil, Germany, Mexico and the Unites States after the introduction of rotavirus vaccines into the national immuni sation program mes. Subsequently formal pharmacoepidemiological studies were initiated in all these countries. For results see section 'Assessment of intussusception reports following use of second generation oral live attenuated rotavirus vaccines (RV1 and RV5) using ob served versus expected analysis ' below. The US experience from routine reporting has been summari sed in the scientific literature : during the period February 2006 -April 2012 the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) received 584 confirmed intussu sception reports following RV5 administration (182 after dose 1) and 52 following RV1 administration (25 after dose 1). Clustering of cases was observed three to six days after administration of either vaccine (266). The age of the children involved was not reported. Further more, there wa s no significant increase in reporting of cases following dose 2 or 3. The authors conclude that this clustering can translate to a s lightly increased risk of intussusception, which is outweighed by the benefits of rotavirus vaccination. Although there ar e several limitations assessing reports retrieved through spontaneous reporting of adverse events, an extract of submitted spontaneous intussusception reports from the EMA Eudravigilance database following rotavirus vaccination in EU/EEA countries was analysed for this ECDC expert opinion15. It is important to note, however, that essential information was often missing in these submitted IS reports (e.g. age at vaccination, time to onset of symptoms, treatment provided and clinical outcome of IS). In total, 296 spontaneous reports of IS were reported from authorisation of the two rotavirus vaccines in 2006 until 1 July 2014 and retrieved from the E udravigilance database : 198 following RV1 administration and 98 following RV5. Time to onset of symptoms was known for 251/296 infants (85%) . A total of 193 of these cases occurred within 21 days of vaccination, the internationally accepted risk window , and a majority (159/193 ) occurred in clusters during the first seven days following vaccination with dose 1 (see Figure 7) of both rotavirus vaccines. The m ean age for administration of dose 1 was known for 202/296 infants (68%) . It was 92 d \u00b1 33 for RV1 and 95 d \u00b1 43 for RV 5. Th e observed mean age for infants that had received dose 1 and developed IS following either of the two RV vaccines was significantly higher than the mean age in the conducted clinical trials that served as the basis for authorisation. The outcome of the IS cases at the time of reporting was known for 182/296 infants (62%) . Cases were often reported as resolved. However, 23/125 cases (18%) with known outcome following RV1 and 6/57 cases (10%) following RV5 were unresolved at the time of reporting. Reported c omplications included ascites, intestinal abscesses, intestinal necrosis, intestinal resection, hypotonia, bradycardia or shock. No cases with fatal outcome were reported in the time period assessed ( to 1 July 2014). Although no fatalities due to intussusc eption were reported to the Eudravigilance database during the period assessed above, two cases of intussusception with fatal outcome in rotavirus -vaccinated infants were subsequently reported from France in 201516. Additional limitations of this review are that case confirmation by chart review at EU -level was impossible due to data protection laws and that there was a lack of reliable denominator for rate calculation and lack of adjustmen t for under - or over -reporting. 15 The analysis and interpre tation of EudraVigilance data presented may not be understood or quoted as being made on behalf of the European Medicines Agency or one of its committees or as reflecting the position of the European Medicines Agency, one of its committees or one of its wo rking on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 39 Figure 11a.

This is commonly done using historical data , often from medical outcome databases in countries where such population -based data is available. An alternative is to retrieve cases of intussusception through an epidemiological study , engaging paediatric departments or paediatric radiology departments. Common limitations for observed versus expected studies are the use of historical controls that do not check f or temporal trends and the use of unconfirmed cases not validated by chart review. Three studies conducted in non -EU/EEA countries were identified assessing a possible association between intussusception and rotavirus vaccination (RV1 and RV5) using the observed versus expected methodology (see Tables 8-9) (267-269). All studies used historical controls and validated their cases according to the Brighton Collaboration criteria (see Annex 2) (105). The conducted studies showed an attributable risk ranging from 1 per 199 000 to no elevated r isk for RV5 , while for RV1 the estimate was 1 per 19 000 vaccinated infants (see Tables 8-9). The only assessment of the intussusception safety signal in the EU/EEA using the observed versus expected methodology was conducted in Germany . In an analysis of 15 intussusception cases reported following vaccination with RV1 and 12 cases reported following vaccination with RV5 in infants aged 3 -5 months , a significantly increased risk for intussusception was found in the risk window of 1 -7 days after the first d ose of either rotavirus vaccine (standardi sed morbidity ratio for RV1 4.6 95% CI 1.5 -10.7 and for RV5 5.8 95% CI 1.2 -17.1) (269). Since this risk was not observed in children vaccinated when aged under 89 days, the investigators , and subsequently the German Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO ), recommended initiation of rotavirus vaccination as early as possible during the recommended age window of 6-12 weeks for dose 1 (177, 178, 269). Assessment of intussusception reports following use of second generation oral live rotavirus vaccines (RV1 and RV5) in formal pharmacoepidemiological studie s Observational studies to assess a possible association between rotavirus vaccination and development of intussusception have been conducted in non -EU/EEA countries (Australia, Brazil, Mexico and the Unites States ) using self -control case -series, case -control and cohort study designs (see Tables 8 -9) (267-276). Although different study methodology has been employed , they all report similar results and indicate an increased relative risk/attributable risk of intussusception , mainly during the first seven days following dose 1, ranging from 1 per 20 000 to 1 per 69 000 for RV1 vaccinated infants and 1 per 14 000 to 1 per 67 000 for RV5 vaccinated infants in the different studies , except in the first studies by Belongia et al, Shui et al and Haber et al , conducted using US VAERS or US VSD data where no increased risk of intussusception following RV5 was observed, possibly due to small sample size (266, 267, 277)]. A meta -analysis of studies conducted has been published (278) and showed that t he overall estimate of the relative risk of intussus ception during the seven days post -dose 1 was 5.4 (95% CI: 3.9-7.4, three studies) for and 5.5 (95% CI: 3.3-9.3, three studies) for RV5. The overall estimate for relative risk of intussusception during the seven days post -dose 2 was 1.8 (95% CI: 1.3-2.5, four studies) for and 1.1-2.6, three studies) for RV5. These epidemiological studies carry a greater scientific weight than the observed versus expected assessments mentioned above and suggest a class -specific effect. Severity of int ussusception observed following use of second generation oral live rotavirus vaccines (RV1 and RV5) Two retrospective studies have assessed the severity of intussusception that developed following vaccination with either rotavirus vaccine (e.g. whether sur gery was needed for reduction of the intussusception ). In an observed versus expected study from Germany reporting severity in 27 cases of IS following either RV1 or RV5 vaccination, 13 (48.1%) underwent surgical reduction (269) while in a self -case control study from Australia assessing sev erity in 110 cases of IS rates of surgery were 39% (274). Both of these studies were rather small and therefore further studies are needed , carefully considering treatment traditions in the area where the study is conducted .

SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 43 Updates of the EU Summary of Product Characteristics on intussusception in 2014 Benefit/risk assessments for the two rotavirus vaccines RV1 and RV5 have b een formally conducted by the following regulatory agencies: EMA (EU/EEA), FDA (United States), TGA (Australia) and found to be positive , given the severity of rotavirus disease and availability of treatment for cases of intussusception. The EU Summary of Product Characteristics has been updated as follows , in line with results obtained in the above -mentioned pharmacoepidemiological studies , stressing that prompt attention should be given to infants with clinical symptoms indicative of intussusception. EU SPC Section 4.4 (Warnings and precautions for use) 'As a precaution, healthcare professionals should follow -up on any symptoms indicative of intussusception (severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bloody stools, abdominal bloating and/or high fever) since data from observational safety studies indicate an increased risk of intussusception, mostly within 7 days after rotavirus vaccination (see section 4.8). Parents/guardians should be advised to promptly report such symptoms to their healthcare provide r'. EU SPC Section 4.8 (Adverse events) 'Data from observational safety studies performed in several countries indicate that rotavirus vaccines carry an increased risk of intussusception, mostly within 7 days of vaccination. Up to 6 additional cases per 100,000 infants have been observed in the U S and Australia against a background incidence of 33 to 101 per 100,000 infants (less than one year of age) per year, respectively. There is limited evidence of a smaller increased risk following the second dose. It remains unclear whether rotavirus vaccin es affect the overall incidence of intussusception based on longer periods of follow up (see section 4.4)'. Risk mitigation strategies aiming to further reduce the risk of intussusception Following the results of observed versus expected analyses and pharm acoepidemiological studies where a risk of intussusception after rotavirus vaccination has been observed, public health agencies or national immunisation technical advisory groups ( NITAGs ) in three EU/EEA countries have embarked on risk mitigation strategi es. In 2013, the German STIKO committee recommended that rotavirus vaccines should be initiated as early as possible from six weeks of age. In Norway the first dose in the rotavirus vaccine series is offered at six weeks of age and the parts of Sweden (Sto ckholm and J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping regions) that initiated rotavirus vaccination programmes in 2014 , the first dose in the rotavirus vaccine series is offered at six weeks of age in J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping and eight weeks of age in Stockholm . Whether these mitigation strategies using early administration will have an impact on the incidence of intussusception following rotavirus vaccination is currently unknown. Studies have been initiated in Norway and Sweden. A recent meta -analysis indicates that if the first dose of rotavirus vaccination is given at less than 12 weeks of age , around 1 in every 50 000 children vaccinated may suffer from intussusception as a result (AR 1.7 (1.1 - 2.7)), while if th e vaccine is administered later , >3 months, 1 in every 20 000 children are at risk (AR 5.6 (4.3 - 7.2)) (281). Kawasaki disease During review of RV5 clinical trial data a higher, though not statistically significantly rate of Kawasaki Disease (KD) was observed among RV5 vaccine es than placebo recipients . Therefore risk management plans for both rotavirus vaccines included post -authorisation requirements to monitor KD. In a review of all KD reports received by US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) from 1990 t o mid-October 2007 , no clustering of cases and no increased risk of KD in the post -authorisation phase for the RV5 vaccine was observed (282 ). Instead , the reporting rate for RV5 (1.47/100 000 person -years) was lower than the US background rate. Other adverse events Other undesirable effects noted in the initial RCTs are listed in Table 1. Conclusions Severe gastroenteritis with vaccine viral shedding in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency A review of US VAERS id entified nine reports of severe gastroenteritis with vaccine viral shedding in patients who were subsequently diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). This observation resulted in a label change in the SPCs in 2013 for both rotavirus vaccine s, stating that SCID is a contraindication for rotavirus vaccination. Intussusception In pre -authorisation RCTs with these second generation rotavirus vaccines, which served as the basis for vaccine authorisation in 2006 in the EU, no increased risk of intussusception was observed in recipients compared to the placebo groups. This was also concluded in a 2012 Cochrane systematic review assessing vaccine safety in randomi sed placebo -controlled clinical trials published in 2012. However, a risk of IS lower than one additional case in 10 000 vaccinated individuals could not be excluded and risk management plans from regulatory agencies requested post -authorisation monitoring . Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 44 After the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in to routine immuni sation programmes , IS cases following vaccination with RV1 and RV5 were initially reported in early adopter countries (Australia, Brazil, Mexico and the Unites States ). Similarly, IS cases have been reported to the EU/EEA Eudravigilance database following vaccination with b oth rotavirus vaccines . Formal observational studies conducted in non -EU/EEA countries such as Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Singapore and the US indicate that rotavirus vaccines carry an increased risk of intussusception, mostly within seven days of vaccinat ion with dose 1 . An observational study condu cted in one EU/EEA country, Germany confirms the reported increased risk. Following these studies the EU/EEA SPC s have been updated accordingly : 'Up to 6 additional cases per 100,000 infants have been observed i n the US and Australia against a background incidence of 33 to 101 intussusception episodes per 100,000 infants per year, respectively' . Strategies for IS risk minimi sation are currently being explored , with vaccinators and healt hcare workers caring for a ffected children being trained for early recognition of symptoms suggestive of intussusception and vaccines being provid ed early in the recommended age window from six weeks of age . However, no results are available yet on the impact of these strategies . A recent meta -analysis indicates that if vaccination with first dose is given a t less than 12 weeks of age a round 1 in every 50 000 children vaccinated may suffer from intussusception due to vaccination , while if the first dose of vaccine is administered la ter 1 in every 20 000 children will be at risk. Regulatory agencies in low -mortality rotavirus countries such as those in the EU/EEA have concluded that the benefits of rotavirus vaccination outweigh the risks. Kawasaki disease No increased risk of Kawasaki disease has been observed in the post -authorisation period. Identified knowledge gaps and needs for capacity building Published background incidence of IS by month during the first year of life is lacking in most EU Member States. Developing th ese data in more Member States will be useful for observed versus expected analysis of IS . Risk minimi sation strategies , to reduce IS incidence following rotavirus vaccination , are being undertaken in three countries . The impact of these strategies is curren tly unknown and studie s of their effect wo uld be useful to inform others . Training material for vaccinators/healthcare personnel is needed to educate parents on IS risk, symptom recognitions and emergency measures to ensure adequate and prompt treatment, s hould an IS case be encountered. In the EU/EEA r eporting of IS cases by vaccinators following RV vaccination could be improved. Future monitoring of adverse events would benefit from completeness of reporting by vaccinators and chart review for validation . Protocols for observational studies to assess IS risk, should be developed for conduct in early adopter EU/EEA countries if needed . Multi -country EU/EEA studies could enhance sa mple size and speed of results . The question of w hether new ( third generation) rotavirus vaccines/vaccine candidates (e.g. live oral neonatal rotavirus strains, inactivated parent eral whole virus or subunit) will offer better benefit -risk profiles than the current second generation oral live vaccines needs to be investig ated in continued randomised clinical trials . SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 45 Rotavirus vaccine c ost-effecti veness in EU/EEA countries In an economic context , where public funding is scarce, the need to adopt more efficient strategies for all public interventions is paramount. Population health can be influenced directly by many different factors (behaviour, environment, etc.) or indirectly (education, unemploy ment, etc.), therefore the impacts of public health intervention are not straightforward. As a consequence, there is a need for a sound framework to assess the potential impacts of different policy interventions. Economic assessments help facilitate the de cision making process in EU/EEA Member States. There are several types of economic analytical models for prioriti sing different policy interventions; cost -benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses being the most commonly used. Cost-benefit analysis is a for mal technique to summari se the health benefits and resources utilised by public health interventions so that decision -makers can select appropriate options. It appraises in monetary value the overall expected costs and benefits of an intervention in order to choose the best or most beneficial solutions . However, costs and benefits may occur in different time frames, hence the monetary value of both is expressed in present value using a discounting factor. Cost -benefit analysis is often utilised when there i s only one policy intervention option, however when there are many different policy alternatives then cost -effectiveness -analysis is the technique of choice. Contrary to cost -benefit analysis, for cost -effectiveness analysis, the expected benefits from th e intervention do not need to be expressed in monetary value and the number of cases or other indicators c an also be adopted. Rules are then determined in order to facilitate decision -making based on the cost -effectiveness -analysis. In Europe, cost-effecti veness analysis is widely adopted as the technique to identify the most effective utilisation of limited resources. Further more, in cost -effectiveness studies epidemiological outcomes , such as the number of cases prevented, number of life years gained , or so-called 'utility ' indicators , such as quality -adjusted life years (QALY) gained or disability adjusted life years (DALY) prevented are often used. The latter two capture the impact of the intervention , both for mortality and morbidity outcomes. QALYs are the product of the time spent in a certain health state and of a quality of life utility weight corresponding to this health state. DALYs reflect the total amount of healthy life year(s) lost , whether from premature mortality or from some degree of di sability. There is no EU -wide adopted threshold for cost -effectiveness analysis, and only a few countries have set a formal threshold defining a cost -effective intervention . For example, in England and Wales, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunis ation (JCVI) to assess the vaccination program in the UK adopts the thr eshold of interventions from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)17 which currently equals GBP 30 000 (EUR 35 000) for health services and personal services . In the Netherlands the threshold used is often set at EUR 20 000 per life year or QALY gained. To the best of the authors ' knowledge , no similar thresholds have been adopted in northern, central, eastern or southern Europe and they would probably vary sign ificantly anyway , as such a threshold depend s on the wealth of the country and organisation of the healthcare system. Assessing cost -effectiveness is often one of several important factors considered when a new vaccine is evaluated for possible introduction into a routine programme. However, the measurement of the reduction in quality of life for a disease affecting young children , such as in the case of rotavirus vaccines , poses unsolved methodological challenges . This is particular ly relevant b ecause any assessment has to be made by proxy through a caregiver. With the high morbidity but low mortality attached to rotavirus -induced gastroenteritis in EU/EEA countries, estimation of cost - effectiveness ratios based solely on life years gained would lead to an underestimation of the benefits of vaccination . This chapter summarises published evaluations of cost -effectiveness for the introduction of rotavirus vaccines into national immuni sation programmes in the EU/EEA. 17 https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/224864/JCVI_Code_of_Practice_revision_2013_ - _final.pdf Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 46 Cost -effectiveness studies conducted in EU/EEA countries Cost-effectiveness studies from Belgium, England and Wales, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom , have been identified with the appraisal of cost -effectiveness for universal infant rotavirus immunisation based on use of either RV1 or RV5 vaccines (132, 158, 168, 283-299). To date n o EU/EEA M ember States in central or eastern Europe have published cost -effectiveness data for rotavirus vaccines. Study methodology and results are summarised in Tables 1 0 and 1 1. Studies used static or dynamic model s and included a variety of main assumptions and parameter values and are therefore not comparable. The assum ptions and parameter values that varied were the perspective of analysis (health care provider costs only or societal costs in addition), whether quality of life (QALY) was included, different discount rates, whether nosocomial infections were included, varying vaccine efficacy assumptions, and expected vaccine prices. Studies were either commissioned by the pharmaceutical indu stry and conducted by academia or by public health experts /academia independent of industry. Based on the list price in respective countries for a complete course of rotavirus vaccination with two or three doses available at the time of analysis (range EU R 75-187), only one study in Finland deemed the intervention to introduce rotavirus vaccine to be a cost-saving over the current practice of managing cases of rotavirus infection, which includes rehydrating severely affected children as in -patients. Cost -effectiveness estimates varied widely, as did the assumptions and parameter values underlying their calculation, ranging from lower estimate range values of below EUR 20 000 per QALY gained to upper range values of over EUR 200 000 per QALY gained (285), (299) (see Table 11). The choice of different end -point measurements in the clinical trials complicates the analysis (see Annex 1 for a comparison of the two severity scales used in the clinical trials). This is accounted for in the tables by showing ranges of results , depending on the vaccine costs and effectiveness values considered in the studies for each vaccine. For the sake of simplification, although all studies included sensitivity analysis, only results for the base -case scenarios are presented. The main differences bet ween studies lie in: Scope of analyses . Four types of costs can be distinguished; direct medical costs (costs of treatment), direct non-medical costs (home assistance, transportation, etc.), indirect costs (care -providers leave of absence due to disease in child or disease in care -provider, etc.) and intangible costs (loss in quality of life, etc.) . The societal perspective usually includes the non -medical direct costs borne by the families and the indirect costs, resulting from time off work inducing loss in productivity and/or loss in wages for the carers whereas the healthcare associated cost perspective takes into account the medical and non -medical costs only . Rates of discounting (i.e. conversion of future values of costs or health effects to their pr esent values). The impacts of a public health intervention are usually not observed at the same time as the funding of the intervention, hence usually both intervention benefits and costs are discounted to their present values. All studies but one discount ed the costs at a rate between 3 and 4% but the rates used for the benefits vary more widely (1.5-5%). The range of discounting rate adopted is in line with results from different economic studies. It is worth noting that the higher the discounting rate th e lower the present value . In many studies (mainly for the Netherlands and Belgium), asymmetric discounting rates have been adopted with a higher discounting rate for costs of intervention than for the impact of the intervention, th us increasing the presen t value of related impacts from an intervention . Such a choice favours vaccination rather than no vaccination . Quality of the epidemiological parameters and cost estimates . Most RVGE are self -limiting and their true incidence (see Table 5) and associated c osts are often poorly measured. Acute gastroenteritis is frequent in children under five years but the contribution of rotaviruses is not well quantified. Even for severe cases leading to hospitalisations, the percentage attributable to rotaviruses is larg ely unknown, leading to varying estimates, as the clinical management is independent of the pathogen causing the diarrhoea. Choices regarding whether or not to include in the analysis cases for which no care is sought are likely to partially explain the heterogeneity in the results of the different studies. This has been identified as the main factor contributing to the discrepan cy in the results obtained in two UK cost -utility studies. The burden of nosocomial infections is very difficult to assess and m any studies having neglected them on the basis of the lack of data. In addition, potential herd protection was considered in a dynamic transmission model assessing cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination in England and Wales (300). This model predicts that RV5 vaccination is likely to be cost - effective in England and Wales at GBP 60 per course and in some scenarios the vaccination is predicted to be not only cost -effective but also cost -saving . Only one study by Bruijning -Verhagen et al conducted in the Netherlands suggests targeted rotavirus vaccination of high-risk infants as a low cost and highly cost -effective alternative to universal vaccination (144). SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 47 Conclusions Identified studies on cost -effectiveness of universal rotavirus vaccination in the EU/EEA provide discrepant results. The inclusion of societal costs , and/or positive indirect benefits of the vaccines such as herd protection , significantly affects the cost-effective ness ratios . There are difference s among Member States , not only in the conclusions of the studies but also in the impact of the studies on whether countries have introduce d the rotavirus vaccine into the ir programmes . Until now a recent survey in EU/EEA Member States found that eight out of eleven countries having undertaken economic assessments have introduced rotavirus vaccines into their programmes while only six have published their results (Belgium, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom)18. First impact data after implementation of rotavirus vaccines in national immuni sation programmes are now becoming available and herd protection effect is significant. Countries still wanting to conduct cost - effectiveness modelling should consider including herd effects in dynamic or semi -dynamic models . Identified knowledge gaps and needs for capacity building Lack of a tradition for conduct ing cost-effectiveness analyses before introduc ing new v accines was identified in a majority of EU/EEA Member States . Sharing available health economic models of rotavirus vaccination cost-effectiveness should be encouraged so that they c an be used in various settings in interested EU/EEA countries Further imp act studies in countries that have introduced rotavirus vaccines into their paediatric immuni sation programmes will enable comparison between the uncertain results obtained in the modelling exercises to outcomes observed upon introduction . 18 VENICE III report on the current status of introduction of rotavirus vaccination into national immunisation programmes in Europe, submitted to ECDC May 2016.

One study from the Netherlands addressing attitudes to rotavirus vaccination among parents concluded that w hen deciding about vaccination against rotavirus, parents are mostly driven by the out -of- pocket costs, vaccine effectiveness, protection duration, and frequency of severe side effects. The highest vaccination coverage is expected for a vaccine with high effectiveness and protection duration that is implemented within the current national immuni sation program me context (301). Another study describing knowledge and attitudes of public health residents (n=1 304) originating from five European countries (Fr ance, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom) to immunisation programmes discussed self-reported knowledge on vaccines, awareness of epidemics and prevention campaigns a nd attitudes towards vaccination (perceived importance) (302). This group of healthcare workers in training will often be responsible for implementing and monitoring immuni sation programmes however around 25% of residents reported their own level of knowledge on vaccines to be insufficient , with the lowest levels of knowledge in relation to t he new vaccines : rotavirus, varicella, and HPV vaccination for men. The authors of this study conclude that public he alth residents do not always feel sufficiently educated to deal with vaccine -related issues and there is room for improvement. The high vaccination coverage (60 -90%) reported by EU/EEA countries that have initiated rotavirus vaccination is an indirect indi cation of good a cceptance , both among parents and healthcare workers (see Table 4). Conclusion s A study from the Netherlands assessed parental attitudes to rotavirus vaccination and identified that vaccine safety, effectiveness, duration of protection and whether the vaccine is offered free of charge were the most important factors contributing whether they would vaccinate their children. Limited information was identified addressing healthcare worker attitudes beyond a study among public health residents and identified a need for further education. Identified knowledge gaps and needs for capacity building Research addressing parental and healthcare worker attitudes towards rotavirus vaccination and other vaccinations need s to be strengthened. SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 51 4. Options for monitoring and evaluating impact of rotavirus vaccination Building on the results obtained in the literature review , the experts identified options for monitoring and evaluating the impact of rotavirus vaccination. Information on e fficacy, effectiveness and safety information for both RV1 and RV5 vaccines are available from randomised clinical trials and from the initial phase of implementing the vaccines in to routine p aediatric vaccination programmes in a number of countries in the Americas, Australia and Europe. However, information needs to be collected systematic ally on long -term vaccine effectiveness, vaccine safety and possible rotavirus strain replacement with clinical significance for continuous evidence -based benefit -risk as sessment s. The main objective of vaccination against rotavirus in the paediatric immuni sation programmes is to protect against moderate -to-severe disease and thereby prevent hospitalisation and death. In addition, it is likely that consultancy for moderat e/severe rotavirus disease in emergency departments will be significantly reduced. Preparing for rotavirus vaccine introduction Before implementing rotavirus vaccination consideration should be given to how such a programme can be prioriti sed within a wide r public health context. It is therefore recommended t hat information is obtained on burden of moderate -to-severe disease leading to hospitalisation and that circulating rotavirus genotypes are characterised . Traditionally this has been done in epidemiolog ical studies but another option is to establish routine or sentinel surveillance systems for assessing burden of disease and circulating rotavirus strains . This may include: develop ment of a case definition for severe rotavirus disease ; establish ment of universal or sentinel reporting of severe rotavirus disease leading to hospitalisation and/or death ; establish ment of sampling frames and genotyping methods which provide representative and comparable data within each country and possibly across countries ; Further more, it is becoming more common for cost-effectiveness analys es to be required in the decision -making process for introduction of new vaccines. Monitoring impact of rotavirus vaccine programmes Vaccine exposure/coverage It advisable to collect individual exposure data , including : name gender date of birth of infant date of vaccination which rotavirus vaccine was provided , including batch number which dose in the series was administered . It should also be e nsure d that rotavirus vaccine s are administered timely in line with national vaccine programme recommendations , particularly important for rotavirus vaccines to mitigate risk of intussusception , and that overall vaccine coverage is monitored . Monitoring of rotavirus vaccine safety It should be considered to collect data on c ountry -specific background incidence rate of intussusception to facilitate observed -versus -expected assessment of reported intussusception cases, if needed . Should intussusception cases occur , it should be ensure d that vaccin ators and healthcare workers responsible for treatment of affected child ren report all the relevant information needed for regulatory, public health agencies or market authorisation holders to assess the individual case in line with national and internatio nal requirements (see checklist of information needed in Annex 3). In addition to the individual exposure data mentioned above , the following information is suggested : date of onset of symptoms suggestive of intussusception ; detailed description of clinica l symptoms and possible complications ; detailed description of diagnosis confirmation with radiology and/or ultrasound ; treatments needed to resolve the intussusception (date of interventions and , if several interventions were needed , dates for each one), and the final outcome including any residual sequelae in each affected infant. It is most helpful for assessors if a copy of the discharge note from the hospital stay is attached to the case report. Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy SCIENTIFIC ADVICE 52 Monitoring of short -term rotavirus vaccine effectiveness The second generation rotavirus vaccines will not induce steril ising immunity. Therefore rotaviruses will continue to circulate in European populations and are expected to provide natural boosters to vaccinated individuals throughout life. However, circulating viruses may reassort and new emerging strains may be imported , making it essential to monitor rot avirus strains. Methods to assess the impact of rotavirus vaccines and the immuni sation programmes implemented in European setting s at clinically -relevant disease endpoints may include the following elements: monitoring reduction in hospitalisation s for rotavirus disease monitoring reduction in number of laboratory samples sent for rotavirus diagnosis sentinel surveillance of circulat ing rotavirus strains , including samples for genotyping from possible breakthrough infections (breakthrough infections will occur since the vaccine does not provide 100% protection and increases or clusters of breakthrough infections should be monitored ) specifically -designed impact studies (ECDC protocols available for case -control, cohort and impact studies .)19 When evaluating reduction in hospitalisation, historical controls are often useful , especially in count ries that are able to achieve high immuni sation coverage from the initial phase of the routine programme. Upon introduction of rotavirus vaccines in infants, it is expected that there will be a gradual reduction in the number of children hospitali sed with severe rotavirus disease , as follows: first season - reduction expected in children aged 2 -3 to 6 months second season - reduction expected in children aged 2 -3 to <12 months, perhaps also in the age group 12 - 24 months third season - reduction expected in children aged 2 -3 to 24 months, perhap s also in the age group > 24 months . A potential shift of the disease pattern to affect mainly older age groups (increased proportion of older children ), however likely not in any high numbers, ineligible for vaccination will naturally be seen during the initial phase but, if the vaccines provide long -term protection as well as herd protection , this is expected to subside within four to five years. It is common that epidemiological incidence monitoring is being done using the following age cat egories < 1 ye ar, < 2 years, < 5 years , 5-14 years, 15 -49 years, >50 years . Monitoring of long -term rotavirus vaccine effectiveness In order to survey vaccine effectiveness in the long-term it is essential to use appropriate population -based sampling procedures among va ccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Routine surveillance of hospitalised cases caused by rotaviruses is encouraged. It is particular ly importan t to test suspected rotavirus disease in fully immuni sed children to monitor possible rotavirus strain replacement. 19 Three generic study protocols for rotavirus vaccine effectiveness and impact studies using differe nt methodologies are available on the ECDC website : http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm.aspx? ID=82&List=8db7286c -fe2d- 476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568 SCIENTIFIC ADVICE Expert opinion on rotavirus vaccination in infancy 53 5. Conclusions and possible implications for public health practice and research Burden of disease studies assessing severe rotavirus disease leading to hospitalisation conducted in eighteen EU/EEA countries before rotavirus vaccine introduction suggest that there are around 75 000-150 000 hospitalisations in children under five years annually, although mortality is low. Two rotavirus vaccines for use in routine immuni sation programmes have be en authorised for prevention of RVGE and shown, in a series of studies, to be effective in preventing hospitalisation. Vaccine effectiveness against rotavirus -related hospitali sation ranges between 85 -90% in countries with low mortality due to rotavirus disease (all EU/EEA countries are categorised as low-mortality countries). Further more, herd protection contributes to the overall impact of vaccination programmes. A risk of up to six additional intussusception cases per 100 000 vaccinated infants has been identified for both rotavirus vaccines. Benefit -risk has been assessed by many regulatory agencies throughout the world (including EU EMA, US FDA, and Australian TGA) and was found to be positive , given the severity of rotavirus disease and availability of treatment for cases of intussusception. However, options for risk minimi sation with the current vaccines should be explored. It is importan t for parents and healthcare workers to be vigilant to ensure that affected infants are promptly cared for , as recommended in the EU/EEA SPC. Research should be undertaken to further reduc e this risk , for example by develop ing new rotavirus vaccines. Finally, available health economic models of cost -effectivene ss for rotavirus vaccination should be shared so that they c an be used by those E U/EEA countries interested . The expert panel suggests the following set of data and monitoring to be considered at the EU -level and in EU/EEA Member States before and after i ntroduction of rotavirus vaccine into a routine programme : consider developing a case -definition for severe rotavirus disease relevant for disease surveillance and epidemiological studies suitable to assess burden of disease and impact of implemented rota virus immuni sation programmes; consider organi sing case -based EU -wide, country -wide or sentinel surveillance of severe rotavirus disease leading to hospitali sation and/or death before and after vaccine introduction; consider investigating suspected and r eported laboratory -confirmed rotavirus disease cases including breakthrough infections , if observed number of cases exceeds the expected, in fully vaccinated individuals (including genotyping and sequencing of causing rotavirus strain); consider organi sing virological surveillance in a statistically sound and geographically representative sample of circulating RV strains; consider collecting data on individual rotavirus vaccine exposure (including age and batch number) and overall rotavirus vaccine coverage ; consider compiling country -specific background incidence rates of intussusception (by month of age during the first year of life) in additional EU/EEA M ember States since geographical differences have been observed; assess long -term impact (including monitoring for strain replacement, vaccine effectiveness and safety) of rotavirus vaccines used in immuni sation programmes from a statistically sound and geographically representative sample within the EU/EEA .

Strengths of methodology used in this expert opinion The evidence for this report was collected using different methods : a literature review in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases, referrals to additional literature i dentified by a panel of experts , AF members and public consultation , as well a s information on spontaneously reported cases of intussusception from the EMA Eudravigilance database. Meta-analyses of rotavirus vaccine efficacy and effectiveness data are provided. Further, m eta-analysis data on burden of nosocomial rotavirus disease an d herd protection following rot avirus vaccination are presented The opinion provided is based on scientific evidence identified in the literature review , the opinions of a group of independent EU/EEA public health experts reviewing the evidence and discus sions and the adoption of the ECDC Advisory Forum . 7. Limitations of methodology used in this expert opinion The literature search was limited to publications released until February 2014. The additional literature provided by the experts and the public c onsultation procedure proved useful as it allowed the inclusion of relevant evidence that was published later and would have otherwise been omitted. Although the literature search was made according to standards for a systematic review with meta -analysis , the evaluation was conducted with less resources than recommended for a systematic review. Further more, it was not possible to grade the quality of evidence. Additional limitations are that cases reported spontaneous ly to the EMA Eudravigilance database could not be confirmed by chart review due to national data protection laws and there was no reliable denominator of vaccinated infants for rate calculation s and no adjustment for under - or over -reporting. 8.

The two severity scales, the Vesikari 20 -point scale and th e Clark 24 -point scale, used to assess rotavirus gastroenteritis in clinical trials differ and have recently been compared ( Table A1) (303)]. A comparison of the severi ty assessment results revealed that more than 50% of the cases defined as severe by the Vesikari scale were defined as moderate (63%) and mild (2%) by the Clark scale. Furthermore, 19% defined as mild by the Clark scale were defined as severe by the Vesika ri scale. It was also impossible to analyse t he results from the two severity scales statistically because the distribution categories were not even; the Clark scale is divided into three ranges (<9, 9 -16 and >16), while the Vesikari scale is divided into two ranges (<11 and >11). The authors attempted to further divide the children in the study by creating three categories using the Vesikari scale. This improved the correlation between the two scales but still did not achieve a high correlation, since only 55% of those with a scoring of >15 in the Vesikari scale were defined as severe by the Clark scale. The authors conclude d that future rotavirus vaccine trials should use only one severity scale for uniformity, or use clinical parameters fitting to both th e Clark and Vesikari scales, enabling the calculation of both severity scores. This would facilitate the interpretation of efficacy /effectiveness results and comparisons between current and future rotavirus vaccines. Table A1.
