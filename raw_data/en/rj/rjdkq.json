Vol. 06-1Preface The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is published once each month by the Department of Administration, Office of the Administrative Rules Coordinator, pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a monthly compilation of all administrative rule-making documents in Idaho. The Bulletin publishes the official rulemaking notices and administrative rule text of state agency rulemakings and other official documents as necessary. State agencies are required to provide public notice of rulemaking activity and invite public input. The public receives notice of rulemaking activity through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and the Legal Notice published monthly in local newspapers. The Legal Notice provides reasonable opportunity for public input, either oral or written, which may be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the Rulemaking Notice published in the Bulletin. After the comment period closes, the agency considers fully all information submitted in regard to the rule. Comment periods are not provided in temporary or final rule-making activities. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is cited by year and issue number. For example, Bulletin 05-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2005; Bulletin 06-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2006. Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; Volume No. 05 -1 refers to January 2005; Volume No. 05 -2 refers to February 2005; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin published in January of 2006 is cited as Volume 06-1. The December 2005 Bulletin is cited as Volume 05-12. RELATIONSHIP TO THE I DAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is published once a year and is a compilation or supplemental compilation of all final and enforceable administrative rules in effect in Idaho. In an effort to provide the reader with current, enforceable rules, temporary rules are also published in the Administrative Code. Temporary rules and final rules that have been approved by the legislature during the legislative session, and published in the monthly Idaho Administrative Bulletin, supplement the Administrative Code. Negotiated, proposed, and pending rules are not printed in the Administrative Code and are published only in the Bulletin. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect, or to determine if a change has occurred, the reader should refer to the Cumulative Rulemaking Index of Idaho Administrative Rules , printed in each Bulletin. TYPES OF RULEMAKINGS PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The state of Idaho administrative rulemaking process, governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises five distinct activities: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings involve all five. At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when they meet the required statutory criteria and agencies often engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building in controversial or complex rulemakings. In the majority of cases, the process begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of administrative rule. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interest ed parties and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule. Agencies are encouraged, and in some cases requ ired, to engage in this rule making activity whenever it is feasible to do so. Publication of a \"Notice of Intent to Promulgate\" a rule in the Administrative Bulletin by the agency is optional. This process should result in the formulation of a proposed and/or temporary rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 10 January 4, 2006 - Vol. 06-1PROPOSED RULEMAKING A proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency wherein the agency is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish a \"Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\" in the Bulletin. This notice must include: a) the specific statutory authority (from Idaho Code) for the rulemaking including a citation to a specific federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; b) a statement in nontechnical language of the substance of the proposed rule, including a specific description of any fee or charge imposed or increased; c) the text of the proposed rule prepared in legislative format;d) the location, date, and time of any public hearings the agency intends to hold on the proposed rule; e) the manner in which persons may make written co mments on the proposed rule, including the name and address of a person in the agency to whom comments on the proposal may be sent; f) the manner in which persons may request an opportunity for an oral presentation as provided in Section 67-5222, Idaho Code; and g) the deadline for public (written) comments on the proposed rule. As stated, the text of the proposed rule must be published in the Bulletin. After meeting the statutory rulemaking criteria for a proposed rule, the agency may proceed to the pending rule stage. A proposed rule does not have an assigned effective date unless published in conjunction w ith a temporary rule. An agency may vacate a proposed rulemaking if it decides not to proceed further with the promulgation process. TEMPORARY RULEMAKING Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; orc) conferring a benefit; If a rulemaking meets any one or all of the above requir ements, a rule may become effective before it has been submitted to the legislature for review and the agency may proceed and adopt a temporary rule. However, a temporary rule that imposes a fee or charge may be adopte d only if the Governor finds that the fee or charge is necessary to avoid an immediate danger which justifies the imposition of the fee or charge. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative session unless the rule is approved, amended, or modified by concurrent resolution or when the rule has been replaced by a final rule. State law required that the text of both a proposed rule and a temporary rule be published in the Administrative Bulletin. In cases where the text of the temporary rule is the same as the proposed rule, the rulemaking can be done concurrently as a proposed/temporary rule. Combining the rulemaking allows for a single publication of the text. An agency may, at any time, rescind a temporary rule that has been adopted and is in effect. If the temporary rule is being replaced by a new temporary rule or if it has been published concurrently with a proposed rulemaking that is being vacated, the agency, in most inst ances, should rescind the temporary rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 11 January 4, 2006 - Vol. 06-1PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it become a final, enforceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Pending Rulemaking\". This includes: a) a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule; b) a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for any changes; c) the date the pending rule will become final and effective; d) an identification of any portion of the rule imposing or increasing a fee or charge. Agencies are required to republish the text of the rule wh en substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that members of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pending rule. With the permission of the Rules Coordinator, only the Section(s) that have changed from the proposed text are re published. If no changes have been made to the previously published text, it is not required to republish the text again and only the \"Notice of Pending Rulemaking\" is published. FINAL RULEMAKING A final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking procedures and is in effect and enforceable. No pending rule adopted by an agency will become final and effective until it has been submitted to the legislature for review. Where the legislature finds that an agency has violated the legislative intent of the statute under which the rule was made, a concurrent resolution may be adopted to reject the rulemaking or any part thereof. A \"Notice of Final Rule\" must be published in the Bulletin for any rule that is rejected, amended, or modified by the legislature showing the changes made. A rule that has been reviewed by the legislature and has not been rejected, amended or modified will become final with no further legislative action. No rule shall become final and effective before the conclusion of the regular or special legislative session at which the rule was submitted for review. However, a rule that is final and effective may be applied retroactively, as provided in the rule.

All rulemaking actions (documents) are assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The \"Docket Number\" is a series by a hyphen \"-\", ( 38-0501-0501 ). The docket numbers are published sequentially by IDAPA designation (e.g. the two-digit agency code). The following example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket: \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-0501\" \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule being promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01). \"0501\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket r eceived during the year; in th is case the first rule- making action in calendar year 2005. Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (see Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections affected are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section \"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the sequence of the numberi ng is broken the following statement will appear: \"(BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS)\" INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CITATIONS TO ADMINISTRATIVE RULES IN THE CODE AND BULLETIN When making a citation to another Section or Subsection of a rule that is part of the same rule, a typical internal citation may appear as follows: \"...as found in Section 201 of this rule.\" OR \"...in accordance with Subsection 201.06.c. of this rule.\" The citation may also include the IDAPA, Title, or Chapter number, as number of the rule. \"01\" denotes the Chapter number of the rule. : \"201\" references the main Section number of the rule that the citation refers to. Citations made within a rule to a different rule chapter (external citation) should also include the name of the Department and the name of the rule chapter being referenced, as well as the IDAPA, Title, and Chapter numbers.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change. The National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) currently administers a national 12th grade National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) test in a variety of subjects (reading, writing, math, social studies, arts, etc.). Schools around the country are randomly selected to participate and provide information for the national report. The 12th grade NAEP at the state level co uld be introduced by 2007 in reading, math, and science. Idaho's districts curr ently volunteer to participate in NAEP at the 12th grade level. The State of Idaho realizes the importance of participating in the NAEP and the data it provides and believes it is important to require participation by any student selected. Idaho currently requires students in grades 4 and 8 to participate in the NAEP assessments and sees the equal importance of requiring 12th grade students to participate, if selected. The pending rule is being adopted as proposed. The original text of the proposed rule was published in the August 3, 2005 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 05-8, pages 91 through 95.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change. Currently 42 credits are required for graduation. That is si gnificantly fewer than most ot her states. Idaho's math and science requirements have been minimal and as a result, Id aho is one of the lowest ranking states in postsecondary enrollment. The new graduation requiremen ts are aligned with research on the best practices in high school reform. They are also aligned with Idaho's postsecondary admiss ion requirements. Increasing the graduation requirement will better prepare Idaho's high school students for po stsecondary education and en trance into the workforce. The new high school graduation requirements will include 46 credits (rather than 42) for high school graduation and will increase the requirements from 4 credits of math and 4 of science to 6 credits of math and 6 credits of science for those students who enter the 9th grade in 2008, and 8 credit s for math and 6 credits of science for those students who enter the 9th grade in 2009. The new rules will also require the parent approved learning plan be completed at the end of 8th grade, will require all students to take a college entrance examination; and finally, will require all students to complete a senior project. The State Board of Education held numerous hearings, mee tings, and a summit to gather input and comments to these rules. All of those comments were caref ully considered an d the Board made amendments to the rules based on those comments. The text of the pending rule has been amended in accordan ce with Section 67-5227, Idaho Code. Only those sections that have changes that differ from the proposed text are printed in this bulletin. The original text of the proposed rule was published in the October 5, 2005 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 05-10, pages 107 through 118. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any negative fis cal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: Cost estimates include money for teacher training, incr eased capacity for the Idaho Digital Learning Academy, money for college entrance exams and senior projects, while hiring additional math and science teachers before the requirements are fully implemented. Th e preliminary cost estimat es for these rules includ e a gradual increase in funding: $1.4 million for FY 2007, $1 million for FY $3.9 million for FY 2009, $6.8 million for FY 2010, $11.5 million for FY 2011, $14.8 million for FY 2012, and $17.1 million for 2013. The increase from FY08 to FY09 is due to hiring of additional math and science teachers. These increases will continue on a graduated basis through FY13 when full implementation for both math and science is achieved.

The action is authorized pursuant to Section 33-105, Idaho Code and Public Law 107-110 (\"No Child Left Behind\") Section 1111.b.3.C.ix.III . PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than January 18, 2006. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explana tion of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The No Child Left Behind Act requires that states give some type of recognition to schools in addition to making Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). In 2003, the State Board of Education approved two rewards. Subsequently, greater clarification was added to the rule to more clearly differentiate the two awards. This proposal amends the rule to give responsibility of calculating rewards to the State Department of Education (SDE). The SDE currently makes all calcu lations for AYP and can use the same data to calculate the rewards. The SDE follows the guidelines in the State Accountability Plan to calculate AYP and would continue to follow the guidelines set up by the State Board of Education to calculate the rewards. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any negative fis cal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: N/A NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because the rule is noncontroversial and nature and both the State Board of Education and the State Department of Education have agreed to the amendment.

The action is negotiated rulemaking authorized pursuant to Section(s) Section 67-5224 and 67-5291, Idaho Code, and No Child Left Behind. MEETING SCHEDULE: A public meeting(s) on the negotiated rulemaking will be held as follows: Input meetings throughout the state are scheduled from November 2005 through January 2006.Public input has been requested via the State Department of Education website. The deadline to submit input is Jan. 15, 2006. The standards are found on the State Department of Education website: http://www.sde.state.id.us/dept Copies of the standards also may be requested directly from the State Department of Education by calling the public information office at 1 (208) 332-6812. METHOD OF PARTICIPATION: Persons wishing to participate in the informal negotiated rulemaking must do the following: 1. Attend the negotiated rulemaking meeting and participate in the negotiation process; 2. Provide oral or written recommendations, or both at the negotiated rulemaking meeting3. Submit written recommendations and input by January 15, 2006 to the address below: http://www.sde.state.id.us/standards/default.asp DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a statement in nontechnical language of the substance and purpose of the intended negotiated rulemaking and the principle issues involved: Curricular standards in the areas of Reading/Language Arts, Math, Science, Social Studies, Health, Physical Education, and Humanities are included in the Administrative Rules of the State Board of Education. Over the past few years more emphasis has been placed on standards and th e alignment of standards to the state assessment in order to meet the intent of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). One of the requirements of NCLB to verify alignment was to have an outside source evaluate the curricular standards to see if there was alignm ent between the standards and the assessment. HUMRRO was contracted by the Office of the State Board of Educa tion to provide the outside evaluation of this alignment. Their report indicated that there was not a strong alignment between the standards and assessment. It was recommended by the Technical Advisory Committee of the Board to rewrite the ISAT test blueprint for Reading, Language Usage, Math, and Science to ensure fe deral compliance and alignment of standards and the ISAT. A new test blueprint is required for the Spring 2006 assessment. Based on the outcomes of the studies and recommendations from OSBE consultants, it was necessary to reorganize and revise the standards and write new test blueprints in order to meet the federal requirements of NCLB. The policy standards demonstrate growth from year to year in each curricular area and the co ntent standards more clearly define for teachers and administrators what students should know and be able to do. The process will include submitting the notice of intent to promulgate rules, development of a website to gather additional input, revisions to the standards documents based on input, submission of a temporary and proposed rule at the February Board meeting.

THE FOLLOWING IS THE AMENDED TEXT OF DOCKET NO. 16-0305-0502 Section 837 837. LIFE ESTATES AND ANNUITIES AS ASSET TRANSFERS. Conditions for determining if a life estate is an asset transfer for less than fair market value are listed in Subsection 837.01 of this rule. The purchase of an annuity is an asse t transfer that is presumed to be made for the purpose of qualifying for Medicaid. The asset transfer penalty applies unless the participant shows the purchase of the annuity would not have affected his eligibility for Medicaid or, the payment from the annuity is not greater than necessary to meet the reasonable and ordinary monthly needs of the beneficiary. For the purposes of Section 837, the reasonable and ordinary monthly needs are those defined by the maximum community spouse allowance at Section 725 of these rules. The participant must also show that the annuity meets the conditions in Subsections 837.03 and 837.04 of this rule. (5-3-03) 01. Life Estate . A life estate worth less than the value of th e transferred real property is subject to the asset transfer penalty. To compute the value of the life estate, multiply the fair market value of the real property at the time of transfer by the remainder factor for the participant's age at the time of transfer listed in the following table: TABLE 837.01 - LIFE ESTATE REMAINDER TABLE AgeLife Estate RemainderAgeLife Estate RemainderAgeLife Estate RemainderAgeLife Estate Remainder 41 .08970 42 .09543 43 .10145DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0305-0502 Rules Governing Eligibility for Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled (AABD) Pending Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 80 January 4, 2006 - Vol. 06-1(3-15-02) 02. Irrevocable Annuity . An irrevocable annuity is an asset transfer if it does not provide fair market value to the participant. To provide fair market value, an irrevocable annuity must meet life expectancy and annual interest tests listed in Subsections 837.03 and 837.04 of this rule. The value for calculating the asset transfer penalty is the difference between the actual rate produced by the annu ity and five percent (5%) per year. The sixty (60) month look-back applies. (5-3-03) 03. Irrevocable Annuity Life Expectancy Test . The participant's life expectancy, shown in the following table, must equal or exceed the term of the a nnuity. Using Table 837.03 compare the face value of the annuity to the participant's life expectancy at the purchase time. The annuity meets the life expectancy test if the participant's life expectancy equals or ex ceeds the term of the annuity. If the exact age is not in the Table, use the next lower age.44 .10779 45 .11442 46 .12137 108 109 .95455 TABLE 837.03 - LIFE EXPECTANCY TABLE AgeYears of Life Remaining MaleYears of Life Remaining FemaleAgeYears of Life Remaining MaleYears of Life Remaining Female 0 73.26 79.26 74 10.12 12.74 10 64.03 69.93 75 9.58 837.01 - LIFE Estate RemainderAgeLife Estate RemainderAgeLife Estate RemainderAgeLife Estate RemainderDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0305-0502 Rules Governing Eligibility for Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled (AABD) Pending Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 81 January 4, 2006 - Vol. 06-1(3-15-02) 04. Irrevocable Annuity Annual Interest Test . The annuity must produce annual interest of at least five percent (5%). A variable rate annuity meets the interest ra te test if the average yearly rate for the most recent five (5) year period is five percent (5%) or more. The participant can rebut the five percent (5%) interest test. He must show that single premium annuities were not offered by insurers when the annuity was purchased and it would not be practical to exchange the annuity for one with a higher interest rate. Insurers must be rated excellent or superior by an insurance rating firm such as A.M. Best Co. (5-3-03) 05. Revocable Annuity . The surrender amount of a revocable annuity is a resource. Early surrender of a revocable annuity is not an asset transfer for less than fair market value. (7-1-99) 838. (RESERVED). (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) Section 871 and 871.01.a. 871.

They will be covered by the new Medicare Prescription Drug Plan. Under the new drug plan, Medicaid recipients on Medicare will have out of pocket costs of $1 or $3 for each prescription and may also have an additional cost for the monthly premium of their chosen drug plan. The increase in the basic allowance assists this population by providing additional money for the Medicaid recipient so it can be used on their increased out of pocket medical costs. The rule changes will increas e the individual's basic allowance from $67 a month to $87 a month in the following living arrangements: Room and Board Home, Residential and Assisted Living Facilities (RALF), and Certified Family Homes (CFH). TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(a) and (b), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: This rulemaking is being promulgated for protection of the public health, safety and welfare; and also confers a benefit. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that the fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid immediate da nger and the fee is described herein: NA - There is no fee attached to this rulemaking. The $1 to $3 out of pocket costs is for Medicare, not Medicaid. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fi scal year. There is no fiscal impact to the state general fund due to this rulemaking. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to IDAPA 04.11.01.811, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because this rule confers a benefit to participan ts and no objections to the rule are expected.

During the publication of the 1995 Code, data being converted from one database to a new rules database for the Code publication was inadvertently replaced by old data that was being changed th rough the proposed rulemaking that published in the September 1993 Idaho Administrative Bull etin, Volume 93-3. Changes that were promulgated in accordance with Section 67-5204 and 67-5224 and adopted as final in the January 1994 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Volume 94-1, were incorrectly transcribed into the 1995 Idaho Administrative Code. The changes promulgated under Docket No. 16-0403-9302 and codified in the 1994 Administrative Code were incorrectly transcribed and the text that was published was the text as it appeared before the changes were promulgated and adopted as final.

To avoid any confusion as to what the correctly promulgated rule is, the entire chapter is being reprinted here in the correct and legally promulgated final version as adopted in January 1994. A rulemaking was promulgated on Section 100 and Subsection 100.10 was added to the rule under Docket No. 16- 0403-9701 as was approved as final during the 1998 Legislative session. The effective date of this Subsection is July 1, 1998. EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective dates of the aff ected Subsections are the original effective dates on which the rules were promulgated and adopted in compliance with Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code. The original effective date of those Sections is January 1, 1994 with the exception of Subsection 100.10. The effective date of that Subsection 100.10 is July 1, 1998.

In conjunction with members of the regulated community and other interested parties, IDL initiated rulemaking and negotiated temporary/proposed rules to establish rules pertaining to permanent closure of cyanidation facilities and performance bond requirements for permanent closure plans. Th e issues addressed in the temporary rules include, but are not limited to, inclusion of definitions pertaining to the operation and permanent closure of cyanidation facilities, application and performance bond requirements for permanent closure of cyanidation facilities, application fees, and provisions for approving or rejecting an application. The State Board of Land Commissioners (\"Board\") adopted the temporary rule at its regular meeting on July 12, 2005. The Notice of Rulemaking - Temporary Rule was published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, September 7, 2005, Volume 05-9, pages 206 through 234. The issues addressed in the pending rule consist of the negotiated temporary rule text, which is the substantive content of the pending rule, and other, less substantive changes to IDL's \"Rules Gove rning Exploration and Surface Mining in Idaho,\" including, but not limited to, miscellaneous technical corrections; correction of internal citation cross-references; clarification and/or simplification of certain current rule language; deletion of redundant text; deletion of language that unnecessarily repeats statutor y language and replacing that language with appropriate citations to Idaho Code. The Notice of Rulemaking - Proposed Rulemaking (Fee Rule) was published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin on October 5, 2005, Vol. 05-10, pages 377 through 420. After consideration of public comments, the Board adopted the pending rule on November 15, 2005. The pending rule will become final upon the conclusion of the 2006 session of the Idaho Legislature. The pending rule text is in legislative format. Language IDL proposes to add is underlined. Language IDL proposes the delete is struck out. The text of the pending rule has been amended in accordan ce with Section 67-5227, Idaho Code. Only those sections that have changes that differ from the proposed text are printed in this bulletin. The original text of the proposed rule was published in the October 5, 2005 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 05-10, pages 377 through 420. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fees being imposed by these rules. Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that the fees being imposed are justified and necessary to protect public health, sa fety, and welfare. Amendments to Section 47-1506(g), Idaho Code, authorized the Board to require a reasonable fee for reviewing and ap proving a permanent closure plan; the fee may include the cost to employ a qualified independent party to verify the accuracy of the cost estim ate to complete permanent closure. IDL lacks the specialized training and expertise necessary to effectively perform these functions. IDL will therefore seek assistance from the DEQ and/or qualified c onsultants to provide the expertise necessary for permanent DEPARTMENT OF LANDS Docket No. 20-0302-0502 Rules Governing Exploration and Surface Mining in Idaho Pending Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 245 January 4, 2006 - Vol. 06-1closure plan review. These consultations will be necessary to ensure that appropriate meas ures are in place, prior to approval of a plan, to protect public health, safety, and welfare. The pending rule will require an operator of a cyanidation facility to pay an application processing and review fee and a permanent closure cost estimate verification fee. The minimum processing and review fee will be $5,000 or, upon agreement between the department and th e applicant, a sum equal to the depart ment's estimated reasonable costs to review a permanent closure application if greater than $5,000. The permanent closure cost estimate verification fee will be a sum equal to the reasonable estimated costs for a qualified independent party to review a closure cost estimate provided by a cyanidation facility operator. The application fees apply only to appl ications for permanent closure of cyanid ation facilities; operators engaged in surface mining operations are not re quired to pay an application fee. FISCAL IMPACT: No negative impact occurs from this rulemaking; this provision is not applicable.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change. Certain portions of this rulemaking pertain to implementation of fee rules, most of which are closely tied to the expected activation of a new reservation system for th e Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation (IDPR). In response to a legislative request to eliminate a park and facility access fee, we have reevaluated our fee structure and are recommending implementation of adjusted fees for use of our campgrounds and facilities. These new fees will have a positive impact on various dedicated funds, which in turn is expected to generally offset a projected shortfall based on the adjustment requested by the Legislature. Additi onally, several rule clarifica tions are included that are needed to help better define operational provisions at IDPR parks and facilities. Pursuant to Section 67-5228, Idaho Code, typographical, transcriptional, and/or clerical corrections have been made to the rule and are being published with this Notice of Rulemaking as part of the pending rule. Several clarifications are also included that will help to additionally explain operational guidelines for the IDPR. The text of the pending rule has been amended in accordan ce with Section 67-5227, Idaho Code. Only those sections that have changes that differ from the proposed text are printed in this bulletin. The original text of the proposed rule was published in the October 5, 2005 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 05-10, pages 525 through 536.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change. The Commission is adopting the proposed changes to Rules 311, 701, and some portions of Rule 306 as pending rules. The complete text of these three (3) Rules was published in the October 5, 2005 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 05-10, pages 558 through 562. Based upon comments received, the Commission clarifies th e proposed change to Rule 305.02 as applying to residential customers only. The Commission decided not to change Rule 306 to expand the winter moratorium eligibility to include residential customers receiving Lo w Income Heating Assistance Program (LIHEAP) benefits. The Commission found that expanding moratorium eligibility to include LIHEAP recipients would significantly alter the moratorium's focus on public health and safety and migh t result in larger unpaid balances for customers as well as larger utility uncollectibles. The Commission also declined to adopt the proposed change to Rule 306.06 to eliminate the current monetary restrictions on when a customer may par ticipate in a winter payment plan. The Commission clarifies that Rule 306.06 applies to residential customers.

The text of the pending rule has been amended in accordan ce with Section 67-5227, Idaho Code. Only those sections that have changes that differ from the proposed text are printed in this bulletin.

In addition, the Idaho Legislature directed the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to promulgate rules pursuant to House Bill 230 and Senate Bill 1228 (codified at Section 39-115, Idaho Code). DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: A detailed summary of the reasons for commencing the rulemaking is set forth in the initial proposal published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, August 3, 2005, Vol. 05-8, pages 308 through 339. One public comment was received. The rule has not been revised in response to that comment. However, the definition of Modification at Subsection 006.56 has been revised. The sponsors of House Bill 230 and its trailer bill, Senate Bill 1228, acknowledged and agreed that the legislation did not alter the state's existing state only toxic air pollutant program. In revising the definition of Regulated Air Pollutant as a result of the legislation, and in revising the definition of Modification to make the state's minor permitting program consistent with the major program, the state only toxic air pollutant review was inadvertently removed. Subsection 006.56.b clarifies the intent of H230 and S1228 and ensures the state only toxic air pollutant pr ogram continues to operate as it has since inception. The remainder of the rule has been adopted as initially proposed. The Rulemaking and Public Comment Summary can be obtained at www.deq.idaho.gov or by contacting the undersigned.

February 7, 2006, 9 a.m. to noon Department of Environmental Quality, Conference Room B 1410 N. Hilton, Boise, Idaho DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is tasked with developing a plan to address Regional Haze in Class I Wilderness Areas within Idaho and other Class I areas impacted by Idaho by December 17, 2007 as required by the Federal Clean Air Act, Regional Haze Rule, 40 CFR 51.308. The intent of the Regional Haze Rule is to reduce the impacts of man-made visibility impairing pollutants on Class I areas by 2064. The first implementation plan will cover the time period from 2008 through 2018. The plan will set \"Reasonable Progress Goals\" and develop control strategies to attain the progress goals. The Regional Haze Rule provides states with two options to meet the progress goals for stationary sources. See 40 CFR 51.308(e). Under the Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) option, BART eligible sources that may reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to any impairment of visibility in any mandatory Class I Federal area may be required to install additional controls. The other option is an emission trading program or other alternative that will achieve the same or greater emission reductions than under the BART option. Through the negotiated rule process, an option will be selected, and rules drafted, that will provide DEQ with the authority to develop \"Reasonable Progress Goals,\" implemen t control strategies necessary to obtain the goals and satisfy other requirements under 40 CFR 51.308 and Subpart P - Protection of Visibility requirements. The text of the rule will be developed by DEQ in conjunction with a negoti ating committee made up of persons having an interest in the development of this rule. BART eligible and other sources of air pollution may be affected by this rulemaking and may wish to participate. Representatives of the industrial community, special interest groups, public officials, federal land managers, metropolitan planning organizations, or members of the public who have an interest in the air quality in Idaho may also wish to participate in this rulemaking. Upon conclusion of negotiations, DEQ intends to publish a proposed rule for public comment in the September 2006 issue of the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and then present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality for adoption of a pending rule in November 2006. If adopted, the pending rule will be reviewed by the 2007 Idaho Legislature. GENERAL INFORMATION: For more information about DEQ's programs and activities, visit DEQ's web site at www.deq.idaho.gov.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5224, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that the Board has adopted a pending rule. This action is authorized by Chapter 1, Title 39, Idaho Code, and Chapter 21, Title 37, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: A detailed summary of the reason for adopting the rule is set forth in the initial proposal published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, September 7, 2005, Vol. 05-9, pages 359 through 390. After consideration of public comments, the rule has been ad opted as initially proposed. The Rulemaking and Public Comment Summary can be obtained at www.deq.idaho.gov or by contacting the undersigned. IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: Section 39-107D, Idaho Code, provides that DEQ must meet certain requirements when it formulates and recommends ru les which are broader in scope or more stringent than federal law or regulations, or which propose to regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government. There is no federal law or regulation that is comparable to plan and specification review and facility standard provisions set forth in this rule. Therefore, the change s to the rules are not broader in scope or more stringent than federal law or regulations. Section 39-107D, Idaho Code, also applies to a rule whic h \"proposes to regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government\". The engineering standards for design , construction, and operation of public drinking water systems regulate activities that are not regulated by th e federal government. These standards were originally promulgated to fulfill the requirements of Section 39-118, Idaho Code, and pre-date the Safe Drinking Water Act. These rules address the review and approval of plans and specifications for public drinking water systems and the standard by which the agency does the review and appr oval. This is not an activity regulated by the federal government. Therefore, Section 39-107D, Idaho Code, applies. Section 39-107D(3), Idaho Code, provides that any rule subject to 39-107D th at proposes a standard necessary to protect human health and the environment must also include in the rulemaking record and in the notice of rulemaking additional information. This additional information includes any estim ates of risk accomplished, identification of populations or receptors addressed by any estimates, and othe r information related to an estimation of risk. The rules include facility standards which are intended to protect hu man health and the environment. The standards, however, are for the design and construction of public drinking water f acilities. For example, the rules require that water mains be constructed using materials that meet national standards for potable water. The rules are not based upon any express estimate or analysis of risk to public health or the environment. Instead, the facility standards are based upon guidelines set forth in documents, such as the \"Recomme nded Standards for Water Work s\" and the \"American Water Works Association Standards,\" that are generally accepted and used throughout the United States by engineers and state regulators.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that the Board of Environmental Quality has adopted a temporary rule and the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is commencing proposed rulemaking. This action is authorized by Chapter 1, Title 39, Idaho Code, and Chapter 21, Title 37, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before January 18, 2006. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: DEQ has initiated this rulemaking to allow public drinking water systems the flexibility to use point of use (POU) treatment technology fo r treating some chemical contaminants such as arsenic. The rule will exempt small public drinking water systems from the requirement in Section 39-118, Idaho Code, to submit engineering plans and specifications if they serve less than 200 service connections and submit technical and managerial documentation to the Department. The rule also allows public drinking water systems serving over 200 service connections the option to appl y to the state for a waiver of th e engineering plan and specification requirements. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to pr esent the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality for adoption of a pending rule in February 2006. The pending rule will become final upon the conclusion of the 2007 session of the Idaho Legislature if approved by the Legislature. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is necessary in order to confer a benefit. The benefit is the increased flexibility for public water systems to use point of use treatment devices for treating some chemical contaminants such as arsenic. Additionally, the rule provides a cost savings by waiving engineering plans and specifications required by Section 39-118, Idah o Code, for systems serving less than 200 service connections. It was necessary to make this rule immediately effective to ensure that the poi nt of use treatment alternative is available prior to the revised federal arsenic standard for drinking water becoming effective on January 23, 2006. IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: Previous federal regulation prohibited use of POU treatment devices for compliance with National Primary Drinking Water Regulations. In 1996, the United States Congress removed this prohibition through language in the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 300g-1(b)(4)(E)(ii). The revised arsenic standard of 10 parts per billion for drinking water will become effective on January 23, 2006. See National Primary Drinking Water Regulations; Arsenic and Clarifications to Compliance and New Source Contaminants Monitoring, 66 Fed. Reg. 6975-7066, incorporated by reference into Idaho Rules for Public Drinking Water Systems, IDAPA 58.01.08. In order to assist communities with complying with the revised arsenic standard, DEQ proposes this rule allowing for use of POU treatment devices as allowed per federal law. Idaho Code Section 39-107D provides that DEQ must meet cer tain requirements when it formulates and recommends rules which are broader in scope or more stringent than fede ral law or regulations, or which propose to regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government. This rule incorporates language from the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C.Section 300g-1(b)(4)(E)(ii)). The Safe Drinking Water Act states that POU treatment devices \"shall be owned, controlled and maintained by the public water system or by a person under contract with the public water system to ensure proper operation and maintenance and compliance with the maximum contaminant level or treatment technique\". Id. To that end, this rule includes language DEQ deems necessary in order to ensure that POU DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0108-0601 Idaho Rules for Public Drinking Water Systems Temporary and Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 306 January 4, 2006 - Vol. 06-1treatment devices are operated and maintained pursuant to federal law. Although the federal Safe Drinking Water Act does not specifically prohibit use of POU treatment devices for compliance with the nitrate maximum contaminant level (MCL), this rule is more restrictive in that it does not allow POU for the nitrate MCL in community water systems because of the risk of acute illness for infants. POU treatment systems may still be used for complia nce with nitrate standards for non-community water systems under certain conditions where the risk of acute illness is low. The nitrate MCL was promulgated in 1975 by the Public Health Service and re-promulgated in 1991 by EPA (56 CFR 3526). POU treatment devices may be covered under the definition of \"material modification\" outlined in Section 39-118, Idaho Code, and be subject to plan an d specification review. However, because the POU treatment devices are ANSI/ NSF certified pre-engineered un its and are not being constructed individually onsite, DEQ has determined that these devices will not produce a significant impact on the envi ronment or on public health, an d therefore waives plan and specification review for certain small public water systems as specified in the rule. Th e main public health and environmental concern associated with POU treatment devices pertains to the proper operation and maintenance of the units. IDAHO CODE SECTION 67-5221(1)(c) FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT: No negative impact occurs from this rulemaking; provision is not applicable. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: This temporary rulemaking schedule did not allow for negotiated rulemaking.

For chlorine dioxide, a public water sy stem is in compliance with the MRDL when daily samples are taken at the entrance to the distribution system and no two (2) consecutive daily samples exceed the MRDL. MRDLs are enforceable in the same manner as maximum contaminant levels under Section 1412 of the Safe Drinking Water Act. There is convincing evidence that ad dition of a disinfectant is necessary for control of waterborne microbial contaminants. Notwithstanding the MRDLs listed in 40 CFR 141.65, operators may increase residual disinfectant levels of chlorine or chloramines (but not chlorine dioxide) in the distribution system to a level and for a time necessary to protect public health to ad dress specific microbiological contamination problems caused circumstances such as distribution line breaks, storm runoff events, source water contamination, or cross- connections. (4-5-00) 45 6. Maximum Residual Disinfectant Level Goal (MRDLG) . The maximum level of a disinfectant added for water treatment at which no known or anticipated adverse effect on the health of persons would occur, and which allows an adequate margin of safety.

This is the drinking water portion. DEQ proposes to revise Sections 549 through 551 to add provisions for drinking water pumping facilities, treatment works, chemical application, source de velopment, and management of treatment waste residuals. This rulemaking will also modify other sections as necessary to reflect these changes and will add or revise existing language based on input from stakeholders and DEQ. In addition, DEQ will take the opportunity during this rulemaking to make housekeeping changes based on feedback from the regulated community and from DEQ staff who routinely use the rules. Drinking water system owners and operators, develo pers, consultants, engineers, cities, counties, industry, drinking water professional organizations, and the public at large may be interested in participating in this rulemaking.DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0108-0602 Idaho Rules for Public Drinking Water Systems Negotiated Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 314 January 4, 2006 - Vol. 06-1Upon conclusion of negotiations, DEQ intends to publish a proposed rule for public comment in the summer of 2006 and then present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality for adoption of a pending rule in the fall.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that the Board of Environmental Quality has adopted a temporary rule and the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is commencing proposed rulemaking. This action is authorized by Title 39, Chapters 1 and 36, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before January 18, 2006. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: Administration of the loan program is currently paid for by a 4% set-aside from the federal capitalization grants that DEQ receives from th e U.S. Environmental Protec tion Agency (EPA). Federal capitalization grants have decreased substantially over the last few years thereby reducing the funding available from the set-aside to administer the loan program. The amount ava ilable from the set-aside each ye ar is no longer sufficient to fund DEQ's administrative costs for the year. This creat es a dilemma for DEQ because, while the EPA grant funds available for administering the State Revolving Fund (SRF) are diminishing, the amount of funds available for loans is growing due to the increasing dollar amount of loan re payments each year. The work load to issue new loans is increasing as the SRF funds increase. The purpose of this rulemaking is to revise the Rules for Administration of Water Pollution Control Loans to allow DEQ to collect a fee in the form of a percentage of each loan. The fees collected will be used to provide funds for loan program administration. The actual interest rate charged on SRF loans will be reduced by the amount of the fee charged so that there is no cost to the communities using the SRF loans. Cities, counties, districts and associations that own and operate public wastewater treatment systems may be interested in participating in this rulemaking. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to pr esent the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality for adoption of a pending rule in February 2006. The pending rule will become final upon the conclusion of the 2007 session of the Idaho Legislature if approved by the Legislature. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(a), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is necessary to protect public health. In addition, the Governor has found that the fee imposed in this rule meets the criteria set out in Section 67-5226(2), Idaho Code. Unless this fee is implemented in FY 2006, DEQ will run out of funds necessa ry to administer the SRF by the end of FY 2006 and will not be able to make loans for improvements to wastewater treatment facilities. In 2004 the Idaho Legislature added a provision for funding administration to Section 39-3626, Idaho Code; however, EPA has determined that the provision conflicts with the Clean Water Act's restrictions on fund interest earnings specified in 33 Section U.S.C. 1383(d)(1)(D) and the authorized type s of assistance in 33 Section U.S.C. 1383(d)(7). Therefore DEQ cannot use interest earned on loans to fund administration of the SRF loan program. The agency is left with either requesting additional state general funds or adop ting a loan balance fee to maintain the loan program. Imposition of the fee is authorized by Section 39-119 and 39-3627(4), Idaho Code. FEE SUMMARY: Unless this fee is implemented in FY 2006, DEQ will run out of funds necessary to administer the SRF by the end of FY 2006 and will not be able to make loans for improvements to wastewater treatment facilities. In 2004 the Idaho Legislature added a provision for funding administration to Section 39-3626, Idaho Code; however, EPA has determined that the provision conflicts with the Clean Water Act's restrictions on fund interest earnings specified in 33 Section U.S.C. 1383(d)(1)(D) and the authorized types of assistance in 33 Section U.S.C. 1383(d)(7). Therefore DEQ cannot use interest earned on loans to fund administration of the SRF lo an program.

The pending rule will become final and effective immediately upon the adjournment sine die of the Second Regular Session of the Fifty-eighth Idaho Legislature unless prior to that date the rule is rejected , amended or modified by concurrent resolution in accordance with Sections 67-5224 and 67-5291, Idaho Code. AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5224, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that the Board has adopted a pending rule. This action is authorized by Chapter 1, Title 39, Idaho Code. In addition, the Idaho Legislature directed DEQ to promulgate rules to implement the provisions of Senate Bill 1169 (codified at Section 39-118A, Idaho Code). DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: Under Senate Bill 1169, the 2005 Idaho Legislature amended Section 39-118A, Idaho Code, and the Surface Mining Act, Chapter 15, Title 47, Idaho Code, with respect to bonding, closure plans, and time frames for rejecting or approving permits for ore processing facilities using cyanide. Senate Bill 1169 directed DEQ and the Idaho Department of Lands (IDL) to promulgate rules implementing the provisions of the legislation by August 1, 2005. This rule is the result of a series of negotiated rulemaking meetings conducted with members of the regulated community, other interested parties, and IDL. The Board of Environmental Quality adopted the temporary rule on June 23, 2005 with an effective date of July 13, 2005. In addition, under Docket No. 58-0113-0502, DEQ initiated rulemaking for the purpose of making revisions to the Rules for Ore Processing by Cyanidation in response to the Idaho Conservation League's Petition for Initiation of Rulemaking filed with the Board of Environmental Quality in February 2005. Docket No. 58-0113-0502 also addresses an increase in fees associated with the permittin g process as well as any other changes deemed necessary to assure consistency with state and federal law and the effici ent operation of a system for permitting ore processing by cyanidation within the state of Idaho. The two public comments received are in support of this rule. However, issues were raised that are outside the scope of Senate Bill 1169 and this rulemaking. Those concerns will be addressed by DEQ in Docket No. 58-0113-0502. The rule has been adopted as initially proposed in the August 3, 2005 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 05-8, pages 369 through 388. The Rulemaking and Public Comment Summary can be obtained at www.deq.idaho.gov or by contacting the undersigned.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5224, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that the Board has adopted a pending rule. This action is authorized by Chapter 1, Title 39, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: A detailed summary of the reasons for adopting the rule is set forth in the initial proposal published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, September 7, 2005, Vol. 05-9, pages 391 through 419. After consideration of public comments, the proposed rule has been revised at Subsection 007.02. During legislative review of the proposed rule, the Legislative Services Office noted that the proposed definition of Best Management Practices (Subsection 007.02) was inconsistent with the definition used in IDAPA 58.01.02, \"Water Quality Standards and Wastewater Treatment Requirements\". The rule has been revi sed to correct that inconsis tency. The remainder of the rule has been adopted as initially proposed. The Rulemaking and Public Comment Summary can be obtained at www.deq.idaho.gov or by contacting the undersigned. The text of the pending rule has been amended in accordan ce with Section 67-5227, Idaho Code. Only those sections that have changes that differ from the proposed text are printed in this bulletin. The original text of the proposed rule was published in the September 7, 2005 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 05-9, pages 391 through 419. FEE SUMMARY: The existing rule requires applicants to subm it a $100 fee at the time the permit application is submitted to DEQ (Subsection 100.03.j.). This pending rule includes a new fee schedule which increases the permit application fee (Subsection 100.05.). Section 39-118A(2)(c), Id aho Code, authorizes the Dir ector of DEQ to require a reasonable fee for processing permit applications. IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: These rules regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government. The following is a summary of additional information required by Sections 39-107D (3) and (4), Idaho Code, supporting modifications to these rules. Information relating to Section 39-107D(2) has also been provided. The requirements set forth in these rules are based upon best available peer reviewed science and studies and analyses conducted by the regulated mi ning community in Idaho and Nevada, the State of Nevada and other states, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Idaho Conser vation League. These studies indicate the requirements are protective of human health and the environment and do not pose an unreasonable risk to the public potentially exposed. Section 39-107D(2)(a), Idaho Code. To the degree that a department action is based on science, in proposing any rule or portions of any rule subject to this section, the department shall utilize the best available peer reviewed science and supporting studies conducted in accordance with sound objective scientific practices . Standards and performance criteria for construction, operation, maintenance, monitoring and permanent closure of cyanidation facilities were proposed as modifications to the Rules for Ore Processing by Cyanidation by members of the Idaho Mining Association and the Atlanta Gold Corpor ation. These standards and criteria are derivations of industry accepted standards and performance criteria used in the State of Nevada. These standards and performance criteria have been adopted by the State of Nevada as re gulatory requirements. As such, these proven standards and criteria have been reviewed and accepted by Nevada's an d Idaho's regulated community and the State of Nevada. Section 39-107D(2)(b), Idaho Code. To the degree that a department action is based on science, in proposing any rule or portions of any rule subject to this section, the department shall utilize data collected by accepted methods or best available methods if the reliability of the method and the nature of the decision justifies use of the data . Data was not collected or analyzed as part of this rulemaking process. Section 39-107D(3)(a), Idaho Code. Identification of each population or receptor addressed by an estimate of DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0113-0502 Rules for Ore Processing by Cyanidation Pending Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 325 January 4, 2006 - Vol. 06-1public health effects or environmental effects . Release of contaminants from cyanida tion facilities may adversely impact bene ficial uses in both surface and ground waters. Due to the remote location of most cyanidation facilities, populations and receptors of contaminants generated by these facilities are small domestic and community drinking water systems, recreationists, and wildlife. However, questions have been raised as to whether or not the drinking water supplies for Treasure Valley residents will be adversely affected by contaminants released from the Atlanta Gold Mine, which will be located above tributaries to the Middle Fork of the Boise River. Contaminants of concern with the potential of release from cyanidation facilities include, but are not limited to, cyanide, nitrates, chlorine, heavy metals, and sediment. Sections 39-107D(3)(b) and (c), Idaho Code. Identification of the expected risk or central estimate of risk for the specific population or recepto r and identification of each appropriate upper bound or lower bound estimate of risk. Contaminants of concern listed above have been released from numerous cyanidation facilities, including the Stibnite Mine, Princess Blue Ribbon Mine, Champagne Mine, Black Pine Mine, and Grouse Creek Mine, each of which were regulated by the Rules for Ore Processing by Cyanidation as the rules existed prior to July 13, 2005. The pending rules would require significant improvements to design and construction of primary and secondary containment for process waters and pollutants. These ch anges are anticipated to eliminate future releases similar to those which occurred at those listed mines. Expected risks of exposure to contaminants released from cyanidation facilities which are constructed, operated, maintained and permanently closed according to the pending rules are as follows: The expected risk for release of cyanide in concentrations , which might be expected to adversely affect surface or ground water is low. Risks of cyanide contamination aff ecting down-gradient beneficial users of drinking water (either directly or indirectly) are low to non-existent. Ri sks to other surface water beneficial uses, including cold water biota (and Bull Trout), salmonid spawning and reari ng, and primary and secondary contact recreation, are also low. These conclusions are based on the evaluation of a nnual Environmental Quality Reports, monitoring data and trend analyses of physical chemical an d biological parameters submitted to DEQ by current and past operators. The information and conclusions may be found in DEQ's mini ng files for the Bear Track Mine, Grouse Creek Mine, Champagne Mine, De Lamar Mine, Hecla Yellow Pine Mine, and Stibnite Mine. Releases of nitrates, chlorine and other neutralizing ag ents from spent ore disposal portions of the cyanidation facilities are expected, but should not occur in concentrations which might be expected to adversely affect surface or ground water. Risks of nitrate contamination affecting down-gradient beneficial users of drinking water (either directly or indirectly), are low to non-existent. However, the relative effects of additional nitrates on nutrient impaired Clean Water Act Section 303(d) listed streams, such as the lower Boise River, Brownlee, Ox Bow and Hells Canyon reservoirs is unknown. Risks to other surface water benefi cial uses, including cold water biota (and Bull Trout), salmonid spawning and rearing, and primary and secondary contact recreation, are low. Historically, spent ore disposal areas have been the sour ce of heavy metals and sediment releases which adversely affected cold water biota, and salmonid spawning and rear ing in surface waters. However, permanent closure criteria, which include source control measures such as caps and covers for waste repositories, will significantly reduce or eliminate releases from these facilities. The information and conclusions may also be found in DEQ's mining files for the Bear Track Mine, Grouse Creek Mine, Champagne Mine , De Lamar Mine, Hecla Yellow Pine Mine, and Stibnite Mine. Section 39-107D(3)(d), Idaho Code. Identification of each significant uncertainty identified in the process of the assessment of public health effects or environmental effects and any studies that would assist in resolving the uncertainty . Studies of the effects of contaminant delivery from cyanidation facilities have been conducted by operators, state and federal agencies, and Native American tr ibes. However, conclusions regarding the short and long term effects of contaminants released from cyanidation facilities on cold water biota and salmonid spawning and rearing, particularly for anadromous fishes and Bull Trout, are inconclusive. Toxicology studies indicate that if the contaminants of con cern listed above are released in significant concentrations, there may be significant risk to beneficial uses such as drinking water, cold water biota, salmonid spawning and rearing. However, only routine monitoring and evaluati on as prescribed by the current and pending rules are recommended.DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0113-0502 Rules for Ore Processing by Cyanidation Pending Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 326 January 4, 2006 - Vol. 06-1Section 39-107D(3)(e), Idaho Code. Identification of studies known to the department that support, are directly relevant to, or fail to support any estimate of public he alth effects or environmental effects and the methodology used to reconcile inconsistencies in the data . Annual environmental quality monitoring reports for active mi nes in Idaho, which utilize cy anidation, are available to support the risk evaluations discussed above.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5224, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that the Board has adopted a pending rule. This action is authorized by Chapters 1 and 36, Title 39, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: A detailed summary of the reasons for commencing the rulemaking is set forth in the initial proposal published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, September 7, 2005, Vol. 05-9, pages 420 through 436. After consideration of public comments, the proposed rule has been revised at Sections 004, 007, 008, 010, 201, 202, 203, 260, 400, 401, 410, 420, 430, 493, and 600. The remaining sections have been adopted as initially proposed. The proposed rule was revised for consistency with Senate Bill 1220, to clarify the applicability of these rules with respect to municipal and nonmunicipal wastewater treatment or disposal facilities, to incorporate by reference sections of the Idaho Standards for Public Works Construction, and to improve the clarity of the rules. The remaining sections have been adopted as initially proposed. The Rulemaking and Public Comment Summary can be obtained at www.deq.idaho.gov or by contacting the undersigned. The text of the pending rule has been amended in accordan ce with Section 67-5227, Idaho Code. Only those sections that have changes that differ from the proposed text are printed in this bulletin. The original text of the proposed rule was published in the September 7, 2005 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 05-9, pages 420 through 436. IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: Section 39-107D, Idaho Code, provides that DEQ must meet certain requirements when it formulates and recommends ru les which are broader in scope or more stringent than federal law or regulations, or which propose to regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government. Part of this rulemaking involves copying certain provisions that were in IDAPA 58.01.02, \"Water Quality Standards and Wastewater Treatment Requirements\" (WQS), and moving th em to the \"Wastewater Rules\". To the extent DEQ is simply moving and not changing existing standards, Sectio n 39-107D, Idaho Code, does not apply. In addition, there is no federal law or regulation that is comparable to plan and specification review and facility standard provisions set forth in the Wastewater Rules. Therefore, the changes to the rules are not broader in scope or more stringent than federal law or regulations. Section 39-107D, Idaho Code, also applies to a rule which \"proposes to regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government.\" The Wastewater Rules address the revi ew and approval of plans and specifications for sewage treatment plants and other waste treatment and disposal facilities and the standard by which the agency does the review and approval. This is not an activity regulated by the federal government. Therefore, Section 39-107D, Idaho Code, applies. Section 39-107D(3), Idaho Code, provides that any rule subject to 39-107D th at proposes a standard necessary to protect human health and the environment must also include in the rulemaking record and in the notice of rulemaking additional information. This additional information includes any estim ates of risk accomplished, identification of populations or receptors addressed by any estimates, and other information related to an estimation of risk. The Wastewater Rules include facility standards which are inte nded to protect human health and the environment. The standards, however, are for the design and construction of wastewater pipelines. For example, the rules require that joints on wastewater pipes be watertight and be designed to prevent the entrance of ro ots. The rules are not based upon any express estimate or analysis of risk to public health or the environment. Instead, the facility standards are based upon guidelines set forth in documents, such as the \"Recommended Standards for Wastewater Facilities\"-2004 edition, that are generally accepted and used throughout the United States by engineers and state regulators.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has rescinded the temporary rule previously adopted under this docket. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 59- 1314(1) and 72-1405, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory st atement of the reasons for rescinding the temporary rule: Section 59-1322(1), Idaho Code, requires the Retirement Board (Board) to establish contribution rates to adequately fund the retirement system, subject to certain requirements. In 2003, the Board adopted proposed rules that provided for a series of three annual contribution rate increases beginning July 1, 2004, through July 1, 2006. The first of those increases went into effect, but favorable market conditions significantly improved the funding status of the plan and the board postponed the two subsequent increases for one year , until July 1, 2006, and July 1 2007, respectively. The Board has now determined that the two additional increases scheduled for July 1, 2006 and July 1, 2007, can each be postponed another year, to July 1, 2007 and July 1, 2008, respectively. The Board will continue to monitor funding and market conditions and will take addition action if appropriate. New rates apply to the first pay period beginning on or after the applicable date. These changes are reflected in a new temporary rule in docket number 59-0103-0601, effective February 1, 2006. This temporary rule is rescinded the same day, effective February 1, 2006.

The pending rule becomes fi nal and effective at the conc lusion of the legislative session, unless the rule is approved, rejected, amended or modified by concurrent resolution in accordance with Section 67-5224 and 67-5291, Idaho Code. If the pending rule is approved, amended or modified by concurrent resolution, the rule becomes final and effective upon adoption of the concurrent resolution or upon the date specified in the concurrent resolution. AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5224, Idaho Code , notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a pending rule. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 59-1314(1), 33-1228, and 67-5339, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change. The Board has determined, based on actuarial studies and utilization data, that the current contribution rates for funding the unused sick leave account for public school empl oyees under Section 33-1228, Idaho Code, is inadequate to meet the future obligations created under that section. As a result, those contributions rates, which are expressed as a percentage of employees' salaries, are being increased. The Board has also determined that it is necessary to have multiple rates based on utilization, since some school districts grant more days of sick leave than other districts or permit more days to accrue, as currently permitted by Section 33-1218, Idaho Code , which disproportionately increases liabilities to the fund. The rate increases will be phased in over a three year period beginning July 1, 2006. Other changes have also been made to Rules 550 and 552 to avoid manipulation of hourly rates and daily rates used to calculate benefits under unused sick leave and to maintain equity in contribution rates in the event of non-traditional work weeks. Other technical changes have also made to the rules to update the address of the Coeur d'Alene Office in Rule 2; to correct a typographic error in Rule 6; to clarify the retirement election requirements of Rule 122 and to provide for a default election when a member fails to make one; to change terminology in Rules 142 and 147 that more accurately describes the effect of reemployment on retirement benefits; Rule 701 has been changed to conform to a statutory change allowing inactive memb ers to purchase service. The pending rule is being adopted as proposed. The complete text of the proposed rule was published in the October 5, 2005, Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 05-10, pages 713 through 716. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: None.
