AHRQ Publication No. 18-EHC012-E F August 2018 ii Key Messages Purpose of Review To assess the effectiveness of drug and nondrug therapies for treating acute mania or depressio n symptoms and preventing relapse in adults with bipolar disorder (BD) diagnoses, including bipolar I disorder (BD-I), bipolar II disorder (BD-II), and other types. Key Messages Acute mania treatment: Lithium, asenapine, cariprazine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone may modestly improve acute mania symptoms in adults with BD-I. Participants on a typical antipsychotics , except for quetiapine, reported more extrapyramidal symptoms, and those on olanzapine reported more weight gain, comparedwith placebo. Maintenance treatment: Lithium may prevent relapse into acute episodes in adults withBD-I. Depression treatment: Evidence was insufficient for drug treatments for depressiveepisodes in adults with BD-I and BD- II. For adults with any BD type, cognitive behavioral therapy may be no better than otherpsychotherapies for improving acute bipolar symptoms and systematic/collaborative caremay be no better than other behavioral therapies for preventing relapse of any acutesymptoms . Stronger concl usions were prevented by high rates of participants dropping out.iii This report is based on research conducted by the Minnesota Evidence- based Practice Center (EPC) under contract to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Rockville, MD (Co ntract No. 290-2012-00016-I).

DOI: https://doi.org/10.23970/AHRQEPCCER208. iv v Preface The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), through its Evidence -based Practice Centers (EPCs), sponsors the development of systematic reviews to assist public - and private -sector organizations in their efforts to improve the quality of health care in the United States. These reviews provide comprehensive, science- based information on common, costly medical conditions, and ne w health care technologies and strategies. Systematic reviews are the building blocks underlying evidence -based practice; they focus attention on the strength and limits of evidence from research studies about the effectiveness and safety of a clinical int ervention. In the context of developing recommendations for practice, systematic reviews can help clarify whether assertions about the value of the intervention are based on strong evidence from clinical studies. For more information about AHRQ EPC systema tic reviews, see www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reference/purpose.cfm. AHRQ expects that these systematic reviews will be helpful to health plans, providers, purchasers, government programs, and the health care system as a whole. Transparency and stakeho lder input are essential to the Effective Health Care Program.

Rudorfer, M.D. Program Chief National Ins titute of Mental Health Bethesda, MD ix Treatment for Bipolar Disorder in Adults : A Systematic Review Structured Abstract Objective. Assess the effect of drug and nondrug interventions for treating acute symptoms associated with bipolar disorder (BD) and pre venting relapse. Data sources. Ovid MEDLINE\u00ae and PsycI NFO\u00ae, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Ovid Embase\u00ae bibliographic databases; hand searches of references of relevant systematic reviews through May 2017. Review methods . Eligib le studies included randomized controlled trials and prospective cohorts with comparator arms enrollin g adults with bipolar disorder ( BD) of any type with 3 weeks followup for acute mania, 3 months for depression, and 6 months for maintenance treatments . We excluded acute mania and depression studies with gr eater than 50 percent attrition . Results. We synthesized evidence from 157 unique studies, 108 studie s for 28 drugs, 49 studies for nondrug interventions . All drug study findings with at least low -strength evidence were based almost exclusively on adults with bipolar I disorder ( BD-I). Asenapine, cariprazine, quetiapine, and olanzapine improved acute mania symptoms compared to placebo (low -strength evidence). However, improvements were of modest clinica l significance, with values that were less than the minimally important difference , but still large enough that a reasonable proportion of participants likely received a benefit. Unpooled evidence indicated an overall beneficial effect of r isperidone and z iprasidone on acute mania symptoms compared to placebo (low -strength evidence). Participants using atypical antipsychotics, except quetiapine, reported more extrapyramid al symptoms compared to placebo, and those using olanzapine reported more clinically si gnificant weight gain. Lithium improved acute mania in the short term and prolonged time to relapse in the long term compared to placebo (low -strength evidence). N o difference was found between olanzapine and divalproex/valproate for acute mania (low -stren gth evidence). For drugs not approved for BD, paliperidone improved acute mania compared to placebo (low -strength evidence) , while t opiramate and allopurinol showed no benefit (low -strength evidence) . Further, lithium improved acute mania better than topir amate (low -strength evidence) , although withdrawals for adverse events were lower for topiramate. Only lithium reached a minimally important difference for acute mania and maintenance treatment . All other drug comparisons to placebo or active control s for acute mania, depression, and maintenance had insufficient evidence. For psychosocial interventions, c ognitive behavioral training (CBT) was no better for depression or mania symptoms than psychoeducation or other active psychosocial comparators (low-streng th evidence). S ystematic/collaborative care had no effect on relapse compared to inactive comparators (low -strength evidence) . Conclusions. We found no high- or moderate -strength evidence for any intervention to effectively treat any phase of any type of BD versus placebo or an active comparator. All antipsychotics approved by the Food and Drug Administration, except aripiprazole, had low - strength evidence for benefit f or acute mania in adults with BD -I. Lithium improved short -term for acute mania and res ulted in longer time to relapse in the long term versus placebo in adults x with B D-I. Aside from low-strength evidence showing CBT and systematic/collaborative care having no benefit for a few outcomes, evidence was insufficient for nondrug interventions. Information on harms was limited across all studies. Future research examining BD treatments will require innovative ways to increase study completion rates. xi Contents Evidence Summary ..................................................................................................................ES-1 C hapter 1.

Harms Tables ES-1 Evidence Summary Background Bipolar disorder (BD) , also known as manic -depressive illness, is a serious mental illness that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and the in ability to carry out day -to- day tasks. The D iagnost ic and S tatistical M anual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM -5) recognizes a spectrum of bipolar diagnoses that differ in duration of bipolar episodes/periods and impairment: bipolar I disorder (B D-I), dipolar II disorder (B D-II), BD otherwise specified, and B D unspecified. Prevalence studies estimate about 1 percent of the population for B D-I, another 1 percent for B D-II, and up to 5 percent for the full spectrum of BD diagnoses , with relatively similar prevalence in men and women and across cultural and ethnic groups.1, 2 BD represents a signif icant individual and societal burden. Recurrent episodes of mania and depression can cause serious impairments in functioning , such as erratic work performance, increased divorce rates, and psychosocial morbidity.3, 4 People with bipolar disorder account for between 3 and 14 percent of all suicides , and a bout 25 percent of bipolar disorder patients will attempt suic ide.5 Further adding to the individual illness burden, 92 percent of individuals with BD experience another co -occurring psychiatric illness during their lifetime.6 Of all psychiatric conditions , BD is the most likely to co -occur with alcohol or drug abuse disorders .7 Treatment of BD generally begins with the goal of bringing a patient with mania or depression to symptomatic recovery and stable mood. Once the individual is stable, the goal progresses to reducin g subthreshold symptoms and preventing relapse into full -blown episodes of mania and depression. Drug treatments have several purposes. Some drugs aim to reduce symptoms associated with acute manic or mixed mania/depression episodes, some aim to reduce acute depression symptoms , and others aim to reduce acute symptoms, maintain relatively symptom- free periods, and prevent relapsing to acute episodes . Given the chronic, relapsing/remitting course of bipolar disorder and the need for maintenance treatment in many patients, drugs begun for an acute mood episode (including mania) are often carried forward into maintenance therapy. Nondrug psychosocial t herapeutic approaches range from psychoeducational, cognitive behavioral, and family -focused therapies , to interpersonal social rhythm therapy, and are provided both in individual and group therapy modalities. Most psychosocial therapeutic approaches focus the treatment for individuals currently in the remission state of bipolar illness and often specifically exclude individuals curr ently in acute manic episodes. Other nondrug treatment forms range widely from electroconvulsive therapy to treatments for cir cadian rhythms (such as light boxes ), to acupuncture , to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation . This review provides a comprehensive up- to-date synthesis of the evidence on the effects of a broad range of BD interventions ( drug and nondrug). We exc luded botanicals and nutritional supplements. These are part of a broader class of remedies patients may take o n their own for symptom relief. The review address es the benefits and harms of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment interventions for adu lts with any type of BD . Two additional questions regarding treatments to reduce metabolic change side effects of drug treatments, and how effects differ by patient characteristics, such as co -occurring substance abuse, were not answerable with the availab le literature. Reported results focus on K ey Q uestions 1 and 2. ES-2 Methods The review used methods following A gency for Healthcare R esearch and Quality methods guidance. The protocol was posted June 23, 2014 at https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/search - for-guides -reviews -and-reports/?pageaction=displayproduct&productid=1926 . Eligible studies included randomized controlled trial s and prospective cohorts with comparator arms enrolling adults with BD of any type with followup of 3 weeks for acute mania, 3 months for depression, and 6 months for maintenance treatments. We excluded studies with gr eater than 50 percent attrition (with the exception of maintenance studies with time -to- relapse and withdrawal outcomes) because of potential systematic differences between patients who do not complete the study and those who do. That is, attrition may not be random and/or is likely due to BD or treatment -relevant factors. We used published minimally important differences (MIDs) to interpret findings for the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) (MID=6) and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale (MID=1) . 8 If a change in an outcome is at least equal to the MID, the interpretation that all participants benefitted from the intervention is clear . However, because the actual benefit each participant experiences lies somewhere along a distribution of benefits recorded for all the participants, changes less than an MID may also suggest that at least some of the participants benefitted from the intervention. 9 We therefore followed a rule for interpretation that if an estimate of outcome is greater than 50 percent of the MID, it is possible that a reasonable proportion of participants received the benefit. Conversely, if the estimate is less than 50 percent of the MID, it is much less likely that an appreciable proportion recei ved benefit from the treatment. Results We identified 6,116 unique publications through May 2 017, of which 188 were eligible for our review; 123 publications of drug interventions, 65 publications for nondrug interventions . The publications comprised 67 unique drug studies for acute mania, seven drug studies for depression, 36 drug studies for mai ntenance, 48 for psychosocial therapies, and one study on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation . All acute mania treatment studies enrolled adults with BD -I; only two also explicitly included BD -II, and only one BD not otherwise specified (NOS ). All depression treatment studies included adults with BD -II, while two also included BD-I. Fifteen of the 36 maintenance drug stu dies (4 2%) included BD participants other than BD-I, but only five studies also included BD NOS. The nondrug studies were more inc lusive in their included BD populations. We found no high- or moderate -strength evidence for any intervention to effectively treat any type of BD compared to placebo or an active comparator. We found scattered evidence for some drug interventions that were assessed as low -strength for adults with BD -I, but none for adults with BD -II or BD -NOS. However, most manic symptom improvements were of modest clinical significance, with values that were less than the MID but still large enough that a reasonable propor tion of participants likely received a benefit. Very few findings for psychosocial interventions were assessed as low strength. Table A provides a summary of low -strength evidence findings from the results chapters detailing intervention results.

Inactive comparators are comparators such as usual care, quetiapine, and olanzapine improved acute mania symptoms compared to placebo (low -strength evidence). However, improvements were of modest clinical significance, with values that were less than the MID, but still large enough that a reasonabl e proportion of participants likely received a benefit. Unpooled evidence indicated an overall beneficial effect of r isperidone and ziprasidone on acute mania symptoms compared to placebo ES-5 (low-strength evidence). Lithium improved acute mania in the short -term and prolonged time to relapse in the long -term compared to placebo (low -strength evidence). No difference was found between olanzapine and divalproex/valproate for acute mania (low -strength evidence). For drugs not approved for BD, paliperidone also im proved acute mania compared to placebo (low - strength evidence), while topiramate and a llopurinol showed no benefit (low -strength evidence) . Further, lithium improved acute mania better than topiramate (low -strength evidence) , although withdrawals for adver se events were lower for topiramate. Only lithium reached a minimally important difference for acute mania and maintenance treatment. All other drug comparisons to placebo or active control s for acute mania, depression, and maintenance had insufficient evidence. Adverse events for drugs were variously reported and generally not with sufficient detail to allow pooling when multiple studies were available. W hen reported, all drug comparisons generally show ed no differences between gr oups in serious adverse ev ents. Participants using atypical antipsychotics as a single drug , except quetiapine, experienced more extrapyramidal symptoms compared to placebo. Participants using haloperidol experienced more extrapyramidal symptoms c ompared to other antipsychotics. Pa rticipants using olanzapine reported more clinically significant weight gain. Participants using carbamazepine reported more severe rash and number of adverse events compared to placebo. For psychosocial interventions, cognitive behavioral training (CBT) was no better for depression or mania symptoms than psychoeducation or other active psychosocial comparators (low-strength evidence). S ystematic/collaborative care had no effect relapse compared to inactive comparators (low -strength evidence) .

A ll Food and Drug Administration -approved antipsychotics, except aripiprazole, improved mania symptoms when compared to placebo for acute mania in adults with BD -I. However, none of the drugs reached MID. Participants using atypical antipsychotics, except quetiapine, reported more extrapyramid al symptoms compared to pl acebo, and those using olanzapine reported more clinically significant weight gain. Lithium showed short -term benefit for acute mania and longer time to relapse to any mood episode in adults with BD -I versus placebo. Of all acute mania treatments, lithium treatment was closest to reaching a clinically meaningful difference for all the participants as measured by the MID. Evidence was generally insufficient for benefits from nondrug interventions for adults with BD. Low -strength evidence showed no effect for the effectiveness of CBT on bipolar symptoms and the efficacy of systematic/collaborative care on preventing relapse. Our findings are consistent with other systematic reviews of treatments for bipo lar; however, because we excluded studies with greater th an 50 percent attrition rates , our findings are more conservative than those of other reviews . Similar to Cochrane reviews, w e also found benefit for olanzapine and risperidone compared with placebo for mania, and benefit for lithium compared with placebo for maintenance. 52-54 Cochrane reviews have reported benefit for several additional antipsychotics compared with placebo - aripipravole, haloperidol as single drug and added to mood stabilizers, and olanzapine or risperidone plus mood stabilizers - whereas we found evidence was insufficient . 52, 55-58 However, authors of these reviews consistently noted that issues with attrition and medication adherence may have impacted their results. Insufficient evidence for psychosocial interventions wa s consistent across all reviews . 59, 60 Applicability of the review findings is challenging. The trials for drug treatments used restrictive exclusion criteria , making it difficult to determine whether the findings extend to ES-8 adults with BD -II, or BD-I with a first manic episode, current comorbid substance use, pregnant or nursing women, or older adults (i.e., age 65 and over). Conversely, most psychosocial trials provide d too little information on the participant characteristics , limiting the ability to infer from the results. M ixture s of participants may mask patterns of effectiveness . With the current informati on, we cannot determine if or to what extent this contributed to the few findings of nonsignificance between groups. Applicability is further challenged by high attrition rates . Trials with 20 to 50 percent attrition , such as were used in this review, at b est provide an estimate of the efficacy or comparative effectiveness of a treatment for participants who comply with, tolerate, and, in some minimal sense, benefit from the treatment. However, at extremely high levels of attrition, even this interpretation is of limited value to clinicians .61 Likewise, the maintenance trials are most applicable to people with BD -I who respond to initial treatment. Applicability is also hindered by lack of information about diagnos tic accuracy . The accuracy of a diagnosis of BD , or study eligibility, depends on the interviews or screening tools, the criteria used to diagnose BD, and who performs the diagnostic assessment. Additional information and rigor in diagnostic assessment would generate a greater sense of confidence about who the study participants represent and, therefore, the populations to which the study results apply. Uncertainty and debate surround the question of whether the underlying mechanisms support the bipolar types as qualitatively and categorically different or as lying on a continuum of the same psychopathological dimensions. Meanwhile, the importance of diagnostic accuracy is further underscored by the great difficulty in accurately diagnosing the comorbid mental health conditions that were commonly treated as exclusion criteria in the studies we reviewed. Limitations Several inclusion criteria may have created limitations to the review findings. We only included studies if the populations were exclusively adults with BD, or if the bipolar subpopulation results were reported separately. Psychosocial treatments specific to depression or mania that combined participants with bipolar and nonbipolar diagnoses in analyses m ay have been missed and therefore not included in this review. In addition to clearly report ed outcomes for BD populations, we also required studies to be at least prospective cohort studies with comparator. This combination of inclusion criteria led to a number of observational studies being excluded, including those that looked at broad classes of drugs, or individual drugs across broad populations. Thus, harms information was essentially limited to RCTs or extensions of RCTs. We also looked at minimum followup periods of 3 weeks for acute mania studies, 3 months for depression studies, and 6 months for maintenance studies. T his criteria led to many studies, especially for depression treatment and other somatic treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy, being excluded for followup times that were too short. However, given the chronic nature of bipolar disorders, the clinical relevance of short followup studies is questionable. Moreover, evidence that a treatment reduces bipolar episode relapse rates likely requires followup longer than 12 months, because some individuals with bipolar disorder only experience episodes once or twice per year. ES-9 Research Needs Future studies of BD treatments need to consider innovative ways to increase study completion rates (e.g., use of technology for followup assessments and study reminders; \"smart\" bottles for assessing study drug adherence; multiple secondary contacts for participant s and all -inclusive contact information from cell phones, email, to social media; flexible scheduling outside of business hours, availability at the last minute notice). More longit udinal data analysis techniques for intermittent followup would help, but that requires more effort to create data repositories that allow individual patient -level data pooling of these longitudinal studies. Such repositories could also help broaden inclus ion criteria and allow for further subpopulation analyses. Future research should also enroll people with different patient characteristics and initial episodes and maintenance stages to fully understand the spectrum of responses. Attention should be given to addressing all states of the illness throughout the treatment stream. Conclusion We found no high or moderate -strength evidence for any intervention to effectively treat any phase of any type of BD compared to placebo or an active comparator. Low-strength evidence showed improved mania symptoms for a ll Food and Drug A dministration -approved antipsychotics, except aripiprazole, when compared to placebo for adults with BD -I. Low- strength evidence also showed benefit from l ithium in the short -term for acut e mania and longer time to relapse in the long -term versus placebo in adults with BD -I. Evidence was insufficient for most nondrug interventions. Aside from low -strength evidence showing CBT and systematic/collaborative care having no benefit for a few out comes, evidence was insufficient for psychosocial interventions. We were unable to address questions on subpopulations or treatments to reduce the metabolic -related side effects of first -line drug treatments . Future studies of treatments for BD will requir e innovative ways to increase study completion rates. References 1. Ferrari AJ, Stockings E, Khoo JP, et al.

Introduction Background Bipolar disorder , also known as manic -depressive illness, is a serious mental illness that causes unusual shif ts in mood, energy, activity levels, and the ability to carry out day -to-day tasks. The D iagnostic and S tatistical M anual for Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM -5)1 defines mania and hypomania as bipolar episodes characterized by elation, or irritability, and increased energy, plus at least three additional symptoms (four if the predominant mood is irritability): increased pursu it of various goal -directed activities without concern for potential negative consequences (e.g., impulsive shopping, risky business undertakings, unsafe sexual behaviors); increased activity level or psychomotor restlessness; pressured speech or greater t alkativeness; a subjective feeling that one's thoughts are racing or jumping from topic to topic; increased distractibility by stimuli in the environment; and exaggerated self -confidence, at times to the point of grandiose delusions (e.g., believing one ha s special abilities or powers). Bipolar depressive episodes are characterized by depressed mood or anhedonia (i.e., a lack of interest in pleasurable activities) and at least four additional symptoms: decreased energy; psychomotor slowing or psychomotor re stlessness; changes in appetite and weight; sleep disturbance (from insomnia to hypersomnia); difficulty concentrating and/or inability to make everyday decisions; feelings of worthlessness and/or excessive guilt; and suicidal ideation and attempts. Manic and depressive episodes can vary in symptom duration and severity as well as subsequent effects on everyday functioning; therefore, the DSM -5 recognizes a spectrum of bipolar diagnoses that differ in duration of bipolar episodes/periods and impairment: bipolar I, bipolar II, other specified bipolar and related disorder, and unspecified bipolar and related disorder. The latter two diagnoses were captured under the bipolar disorder not otherwise specified diagnosis in prior versions of the DSM (DSM -IV-TR; 2000) and in current research literature. Accor ding to the DSM -5, bipolar I disorder is mainly defined by the presence of manic episodes that last at least seven days, or by manic symptoms severe enough to necessitate immediate hospital care. Mania symptoms m ust reflect a major change from the person 's normal behavior and cause grave impairment . Usually, a person with bipolar I disorder also has depressive episodes, typically lasting at least two weeks , which significantly impair daily functioning or distress. Still, presence of depressive episodes is not necessary for bipolar I disorder diagnosis . Prior DSM versions and empirical literature also allowed for bipolar I disorder diagnosis based on the presence of mixed episodes , i.e., periods of one week or longe r characterized by both manic and depressive symptoms. T he DSM -5 omits language specifying that individuals meet the full criteria for both mania and a major depressive episode in favor of a new specifier, \"with mixed features .\" Mixed features is appli cable to episodes of mania or hypomania when depressive features are present, and to episodes of depression when features of mania/hypomania are present. The associated symptom of psychosis can also shift the episode type from hypomania to mania. Bipolar II disorder is defined by a pattern of depressive episodes alternating with hypomanic episodes, but no full -blown manic episodes. Diagnostic criteria specify that hypomanic episodes, lasting at least four days, must cause a change in functioning observable by others, but this change could be positive (i.e., more productive, social) and not impairing. Cyclothymic disorder is defined by many periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms, but these symptoms do not reach the level of clinical hypomanic or depressive episodes. 2 Bipolar disorder definitions for forms not reaching bipolar I and bipolar II disorder criteria have recently been reorganized and redefined. DSM -5 presented four different case scenarios for \"other specified bipolar disorder,\" including a) histor y of major depressive episodes and hypomanic periods that meet episode criteria except for duration (i.e., last less than four days); b) history of major depressive episodes and hypomanic periods of sufficient duration but insufficient number of symptoms t o meet episode criteria; c) history of hypomanic episodes without major depressive episodes; and d) criteria for cyclothymia met for less than two years. Other cases of failing to meet bipolar I or II disorder diagnoses would fit the unspecified bipolar disorder category. DSM -5 has also further specified that cyclothymic disorder cannot be comorbid/or jointly assigned along with bipolar I or II disorder (e.g., if an individual develops episodes, the diagnosis would change to the type that best reflects new symptoms). Structured psychiatric interviews, such as the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM -IV Axis I Disorders (SCID -I), or the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), are widely used in research settings and provide reliable diagnos es when conducted by trained interviewers. 2 The structured interviews help differentiate bipolar disorders from other common diagnoses, such as borderline personality disorder, as well as between various bipolar disorder definitions. However, such structured interviews are not as com mon in regular clinical settings, where screening questionnaires and clinical interviews are more often used to identify new bipolar diagnoses or changes in patient symptoms. Prevalence studies estimate about 1 percent of the population for bipolar I disorder, another 1 percent for bipolar II disorder, and up to 5 percent for the full spectrum of bipolar disorder diagnoses , with relatively similar prevalence in men and women, and across cultural and ethnic groups. 3, 4 Recurrent episodes of mania and depression can cause serious impairments in functioning , such as erratic work performance, increased divorce rates, and psychosocial morbidity.5, 6 People with bipolar disorder account for between 3 and 14 percent of all suicides.7 About 25 percent of bipolar disorder patients will attempt suicide.7 The disease burden is heavy, with lifelong treatment requirements. Further adding to the individual illness burden, 92 percent of individuals with bipolar disorder experience a co -occurring psychiatric illness during their lifetime.8 Substance abuse is a common comorbid condition; of all psychiatric conditions , bipolar disorder is the most likely to co -occur with alcohol or drug abuse.9 Thus, it is important to identify not just effective treatments for bipolar disorder alone, but effective treatments for individuals experiencing both bipolar symptoms and co -occurring substance abuse and other psychiatric illnesses. Increasingly, empirical evidence supports disruption of specific neural circuits as a factor in bipolar disorders. However, the exact mechanisms that lead to onset of bipolar disorders are still not fully understood. This further complicates a search for effective treatments. Treatment Strategies Treatment generally begins with the go al of bringing a patient with mania , or disabling hypomania, or depression to symptomatic recovery and stable mood. Upon stabilization , maintenance treatment (both drug and nondrug options) aims to maintain euthymia (a nondepressed, reasonably positive mood), reduce any subthreshold symptoms (milder but still clinically significant symptoms), and prevent or delay relapse into full -blown episodes of mania and depression. Questions remain as to whether treatment effects differ by patient characteristics which may impact condition severity or treatment response. 3 Drug treatments are used to reduce acute symptoms, maintain relatively symptom- free periods, and reduce risk of relapsing to acute episodes. Drug treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration for bipolar treatment are summarized in Table 1. Lithium and many anticonvulsants are often also referred to as \"mood stabilizers\" based on their intended treatment effect rather than the drug's mechanism. Given the chronic, relapsing/remitting course of bipolar disorder and the need for maintenance treatment in many patients, drugs begun for an acute mood episode (including mania) are often carried forward as maintenance treatment . Table 1. FDA -approved medications for bipolar disorder Drug Type Generic Na me First Date Approved FDA -Listed Trade Name (Pharmaceutical Co.) Manic Mixed (Mania/ Depression) Mainte - nance Depression Salts X X Sub Latuda (Sunovion Lamictal (GlaxoSmithKline) X forms are available. FDA= Food and Drug Administration Pharmacologic treatment is challenging . Some drugs that alleviate depression may increase the risk of mania, hypomania, or rapid cycling (four or more episodes in 12 months), while some drugs that alleviate acute mania may increase the risk of rebound depressive episodes. Based on changes in the DSM -5 criteri a, in individuals with no prior bipolar disorder diagnosis, drug treatment induced manic and hypomanic episodes that last longer than expected pharmacological effects are now considered \"true\" episodes and count towards a bipolar 4 disorder diagnosis. All approved drugs have boxed warnings indicating serious or life - threatening risks. Nonpharmacologic or psychotherapeutic techniques are applied to enhance medication adherence, reduce episode relapse (maintenance) , and improve social and occupational functioni ng, which are often impaired during and after acute bipolar episodes . The majority of bipolar disorder -specific psychotherapeutic approaches have been studied in the last 15 years. These psychosocial approaches range from psychoeducational, cognitive behav ioral, and family -focused, to interpersonal social rhythm therapy, and are administered both individually and in groups. Most psychotherapeutic approaches focus the treatment for individuals currently in the remission state of bipolar illness and often spe cifically exclude individuals currently in acute manic episodes. Other nondrug treatment forms are based on physical approaches. They range widely from electroconvulsive therapy to treatments for circadian rhythms, such as light boxes, to acupuncture. Scope and Key Questions Several systematic reviews have assessed the effects of bipolar disorder treatment. Available reviews, however, do not incorporate the broad range of interventions (pharmacologic, psychosocial, other nondrug treatments) or necessarily t arget guideline developers with the specific intention of improving the treatment of bipolar disorder. This review provides a comprehensive up -to-date synthesis of the evidence on the effects of bipolar disorder treatments. 5 Key Questions Key Question 1: W hat are the efficacy and comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for adults with bipolar disorder? a.

Analytic framework for treatment for bipolar disorder KQ=Key Question Report Organization As indicated by the structure of our K ey Questions, we had originally planned to provide results for bipolar disorder subpopulations important to clinicians. However, we found that such detail was not forthcoming. Thus, rather than organizing the report by K ey Question, this report presents the benefit and harms results organized by type of treatment. Chapter 4 gives results for drug treatments for mania. The chapter presents benefits and harms for antipsychotics, each drug first as monotherapy, then, if present, in combination with mood stabilizers, followed by results for mood stabilizers alone, and then other drugs. Chapter 5 presents benefits and harms for drug treatments for depression, Chapter 6 for maintenance treatment, and Chapte r 7 for psychosocial therapies and other nondrug treatments. Since we were unable to provide information on subpopulations, we provide tables with details of the treated populations for each intervention. Each of the results chapters also includes a short discussion section for issues strictly related to the chapters' results. An overall discussion of themes cutting across all the chapters is provided in Chapter 8 . 10 Chapter 2. Methods The methods for this C omparative E ffectivenes s Review (CER) follow the methods suggested in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ) Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews (available at http://www.effectivehealthc are.ahrq.gov/methodsguide.cfm ) ; certain methods map to the Preferred R eporting Items for S ystematic Reviews and M eta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist.10 This section summarized the methods used. Topic Refinement and Review Protocol This report topic and preliminary K ey Q uestions arose through a public process. Initially a panel of key informants, involving ps ychiatrists, psychologists, researchers, consumer advocates, and consumers, gave input on the K ey Q uestions and population, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and timing ( PICOT ) to be examined. Key Questions, PICOT, and the analytic framework were poste d for public comment from December 19, 2013 to January 10, 2014. In response to comments provided, we made several changes. We then drafted a protocol for the CER and recruited a technical expert panel to provide high -level content and methodological exper tise feedback on the review protocol. The protocol was posted June 23, 2014 at https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/search -for-guides -reviews -and- reports/?pageaction=displayproduct&productid=1926. Literature Search Strategy We search Ovid Medline, Ovid PsycInfo, Ovid Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to identify previous randomized cont rolled trials and prospective cohort studies published and indexed in bibliographic databases. Our search strategy, which appears in Appendix A , included relevant medical subject headings and natural language terms for the concept of bipolar disorder. This concept was combined with filters to select randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ), observational studies, and systematic reviews. Dates for the search algorithm were 1994 to May 2017.We anticipate d that older, established treatments would be covered by prior reviews, and w e supplement ed our searches with backward citation searches of relevant systematic reviews. We conduct ed additional grey literature searching to identify relevant completed and ongoing studies. Relevant grey li terature resources include trial registries and Food and Drug Administration databases. We search ed ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Controlled Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for ongoing studies. We also review ed Scientific Information Packets (SIPs) sent by manufacturers of relevant interventions. Grey literature search results were used to identify studies, outcomes, and analyses not reported in the published literature to assess publication and reporting bias and inform future research needs. Studies were included in the review based on the PICOTS framework outlined in Table 2 and the study -specific inclusion criteria described in Table 3. 11 Table 3. Study inclusion criteria Category Criteria for Inclusion Study Enrollment Studies that enroll adu lts with any form of bipolar disorder ( bipolar I, bipolar II, bipolar otherwise specified, bipolar not otherwise specified, rapid cycling) using any diagnostic process. Studies that enroll bipolar disorder patients along with other patients with DSM - V diag noses were included if the patients with bipolar disorder are analyzed separately. Study Design and Quality RCTs, nonrandomized controlled trials, and prospective cohort studies for each population and treatment option. Studies must have at least 10 parti cipants per arm at the first relevant outcome period. Except for studies reporting time to relapse as a primary outcome (generally maint enance studies), Studies for acute mania or depression treatments with greater than 50% attrition were excluded for fatally high risk of bias. Follow -on studies of those excluded RCTs were also excluded. Studies with greater than 50% attrition in the treatment arm were excluded if the control arm did not incorporate some form of placebo or attention control; the lack of such comparators creates a situation where the control arm would not be subject to forces prompting a partic ipant to withdraw from a study. Studies for maintenance treatments with greater than 50% attrition were retained only if time to relapse outcomes were available, and then only those outcomes and withdrawal information were includable. Prospective cohort studies must include a comparator and appropriate methods to correct for selection bias. Obs ervational studies that do not adequately report study infor mation to allow the abstraction of time sequences for treatment and followup duration or have indeterminable numerators and denominators for outcomes and adverse event rates were excluded at the abstraction phase. Time of Publication 1970 and forward for trials of pharmacologic and somatic treatments. Lithium was FDA approved in 1970. 1994 and forward for all other literature . This corresponds with the period during which systematic reviews and evidence- based research approaches have been applied to behavi oral health. Publication type Published in peer reviewed journals Language of Publication English DSM -5=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 5th Edition; FDA=F ood and Drug A dministration ; RCT=randomized controlled trial We review ed bibliographic database search results for studies relevant to our PICOTS framework and study -specific criteria. All studies identified at title and abstract as relevant by either of two independent investigator underwent full-text screening. Two investigator s independently perform ed full-text screening to determine if inclusion criteria were met. Differences in screening decisions wer e resolved by consultation between investigators, and, if necessary, consulta tion with a third investigator. Risk of Bias Assessment of Individual Studies Risk of bias of eligible studies was assessed by two independent investigators using instruments specific to each study design. For RCTs, questionnaires developed from the Cochrane Risk of Bias11 tool were used. We developed an instrument for assessing risk of bias for observational studies based on the RTI Observational Studies Risk of Bias and Precision Item Bank 12 (Appendix B ). We selected items most relevant in assessing risk of bias for this topic, including participant selection, attrition/incomplete outcome data, ascertainment of gr oup assignment , and appropriateness of analytic methods. Study power was assessed in 'ot her sources of bias' in studies with data that were not eligible for pooling. For psychosocial intervention, the presence of treatment fidelity, that is, treatment defin ition and implementation, was also evaluated. Overall summary risk of bias assessments for each study were classified as 12 low, moderate, or high based upon the collective risk of bias inherent in each domain and confidence that the results were believable g iven the study's limitations. When the two investigators disagree d, a third party was consulted to reconcile the summary judgment. Data Extraction For s tudies me eting inclusion criteria, o ne investigator abstracted relevant data into extraction forms creat ed in Excel. Evidence tables were reviewed and verified for accuracy by a second investigator. Data fields include d author, year of publication, setting, subject inclusion and exclusion criteria, intervention and control characteristics (intervention components, timing, frequency, duration), followup duration, participant baseline demographics, comorbidities; method of diagnosis, enrollment, and severity, descriptions and results of primary outcomes , adverse effects, study withdrawals, and study funding source. For outcomes, only overall scale scores were reported for all measurement scales; subscales or individual items from scales were not abstracted. Abstracted outcomes included: Responders and/or remitters (for acute states) number and/or time to relapse (for maintenance), including definitions used in the studies, Symptoms scales; only one scale per state per study, following a \"most reported\" hierarchy, Global functioning (including social performance and quality of life for psychosocial studies), Utilization, such as emergency department use, Change in self -harm behaviors, including suicidality, Withdrawals; overall, due to lack of effect, and due to s ide effect s, Serious adverse events; rates of extrapyramidal symptoms, s witching , and w eight gain of > 7 percent. Adverse events were treatment emergent, not treatment -related events. Harms were chosen based on an informal prioritization process with the help of the Technical Expert Panel ( TEP). We focused on patient -centered harms and not on those that wer e already well -established. For maintenance studies reporting time to relapse as the primary outcome but with greater than 50 percent attrition, only summary measures of time to relapse, overall withdrawal, withdrawal due to adverse events and adverse even ts were abstracted. We did not abstract symptom scales due to loss of participants over time. Time to relapse for any mood episode was primary unless the study was designed for a specific episode type; for example, the primary outcome of time to next depre ssive episode for bipolar II patients stabilized from depression. As a courtesy to readers, we also abstracted limited information on studies excluded for greater than 50 percent attrition: study design, enrollment, intervention, and comparison (available i n Appendix D ). Data Synthesis We summarize d the results into evidence tables and synthesize d evidence for each unique population, comparison, and outcome combination. We emphasized patient -centered outcomes in the evidence syn thesis. Results are organized by bipolar type and state (such as acute mania, acute depression, or euthymia). Where available, results by population subgroups were also provided. We used statistical differences between groups to assess effects. For outcome s with well-established minimum important differences (MIDs) , we used the MID to aid interpretation. 13 Appendix C provides a list of outcomes used in the available literatures, with associated MIDs where available. Decisions for pooling were based on the homogeneity of study populations using inclusion criteria, specific interventions, and the ability to treat outcome measures as similar. When pooling was possible, we conducted meta -analyses using the random effects modeling appro ach. Continuous outcomes were summarized with precision- weighted mean differences (WMD) and/or standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95 percent confidence intervals ( CIs). In our context, these were generally difference in difference estimates from each study. If a study did not report a standard error for the difference in difference estimate, we calculated it from a P - value or CI and the appropriate degrees of freedom. If neither a CI nor an exact P -value was given but an upper bound for the P -value was , e.g., < 0.05, we used that to calculate an upper bound of the standard error. If the degrees of freedom of the relevant t -distribution was not given, we attempted to back it out of the study based upon the statistical methods that were used as long as we could confidently conclude that it was greater than 25. Binary outcomes were summarized with precision -weighted log odds ratios (OR) and 95 percent CIs. We used the restricted maximum likelihood estimator (REML) of the heterogeneity variance because, alth ough simulation studies have shown it to suffer from negative bias 13, it has generally performed comparatively well with regards to mean -square error14. We also used the Knapp- Hartung adjustment in order to avoid the potentially high inflation of the type -I error rate that can arise when dealing with small numbers of even moderately heterogeneous studies.15, 16 We chose not to perform meta -analyses when only two studies were available to pool as, in this context, application of the Knapp- Hartung adjustment can diminish power to trivial levels and standard approaches can easily suffer from extreme inflation of type- I error.17 As a sensitivity analysis, we also performed all meta -analyses using fixed -effect models. These results are charitably interpreted as providing an estimate of the true average effect among completed trials and are presented along with the results derived from analyses using random - effect models. 18 However, we base our main conclusions on the random -effects set of results. All analyses were performed with R software19, using the metaphor package.18 We assessed the clinical and methodological heterogeneity to determine appropriateness of pooling data.20 When pooling was not appropriate due to lack of comparable studies or heterogeneity, qualitative synthesis was conducted. Studies were grouped by treatment, bipolar type and/or bipolar state. Phases were grouped as: (1) acute mania or hypomania, including mixed, ( 2) acute depression, ( 3) any acute state (often for ps ychosocial maintenance studies), (4) euthymic or subsyndromal (generally for maintenance studies), and ( 5) nonspecific, that is, either euthymic, acute in any episode, or post - hospitalization (these studies stated essentially any patient with bipolar disor der except acute mania). For drug studies treating patients for residual symptoms, patients were classified as nonresponders to standard treatment (usually noted in adjunctive drug studies). Studies were categorized as maintenance studies if the study incl usion criteria did not specify an acute episode at study entry. Study outcomes were grouped by treatment duration or followup period. For acute mania treatment, outcomes were grouped by 3- 4 weeks and then final measurement (generally 6 to 12 weeks) if avai lable. Depression treatment studies are reported at 3 months and final endpoint. Maintenance study outcomes are reported at 6 months, 8- 12 months, and \"prolonged followup\" of the final endpoint. 14 Comparators for psychosocial studies were grouped as inactive (usual care or standardized care) or active (active head to head comparisons of psychosocial therapies including supportive therapy). We conduct ed several sensitivity analyses where possible. In forest plots, outcomes in studies assessed as having a high risk of bias , or low to moderate risk of bias but at least 40 percent attrition, were presented in grey scale. Strength of Evidence for Major Comparisons and Outcomes The overall strength of evidence for primary outcomes within each comparison were evaluat ed based on four required domains: (1) study limitations (risk of bias); (2) directness ( a single, direct link between intervention and outcome); (3) consistency (simil arity of effect direction and size); and (4) precision (degree of certainty around an es timate).21 A fifth domain, reporting bias, was assessed when strength of evidence based upon the first four domains is moderate or high.21 Based on study desi gn and conduct, study limitations w ere rated as low, moderate, or high. Consistency was rated as consistent, inconsistent, or unknown/not applicable (e.g., single study). Directness was rated as either direct or indirect. Precision was rated as precise or imprecise. Assessing strength of evidence for studies with null findings is especially challenging because several domains are designed to address differences. Although it is important to assess the strength of evidence for null findings (i.e. intervention and comparison yielded results that were not statistically different from each other), it is difficult. It is hard to assess effect size when there is no effect in studies that test for superiority; how does one establish a level of precision that provide s confidence of no effect? This is especially true when populations, interventions, and comparators are not consistent, as is the case with much of the nondrug literature. We also downgraded precision when there was considerable attrition that was addressed through last -observation carried forward methods. Due to the large number of comparisons with findings of no effect, we assessed strength of evidence and formulated results cautiously. Based on these factors, the overall evidence for e ach outcome was rat ed as : 21 High: Very confident that estimate of effect lies close to true effect . Few or no deficiencies in body of evidence, findings believed to be stable. Moderate: Moderately confidence that estimate of effect lies close to true effect. Some deficiencies in body of evidence; findings likely to be stable, but some doubt. Low: Limited confidence that estimate of effect lies close to true effect; major or numerous deficiencies in body of evidence. Additional evidence necessary before concluding that findings are stable or that estimate of effect is close to true effect. Insufficient: No evidence, unable to estimate an effect, or no confidence in estimate of effect. No evidence is available or the body of evidence precludes judgment. We a ssessed strength of evidence for validated scales (such as the Beck Depression Inventory, Young Mani a Rating Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Clinical Global Improvement Scale) and commonly used items that examine improved function (such as the Functional Assessment Short Test). We did not assess strength of evidence for less commonly measured it ems such as increased time between episodes or hospitalizations. Attempted suicide and other self -harming behaviors were also not assessed for strength of evidence due to the difficulty of defining and measuring such behaviors. 15 Applicability Applicability of studies was determined according to the PICOTS framework. Bipolar research generally draws from highly defined populations, resulting in samples that are often drawn from subpopulations rather than the bipolar populations at large. Thus, the ability to infer generalizability can be compromised. Applicability also deals with transportability of evidence for the type of treatment \u2014level of treatment, treatment fidelity, skills of treatment agent, setting (and measurement) \u2014and its fit to a particular treatme nt setting. Study characteristics that may affect applicability include, but are not limited to, the population from which the study participants are enrolled, diagnostic assessment processes, narrow eligibility criteria, and patient and intervention chara cteristics different than those described by population studies of bipolar disorder. 22 These applicability issues are present in the synthesis frameworks and sensitivity analyses described in more detail in the data synthesis section. Peer Review and Public Commentary Experts in bipolar disorder and systematic reviews were invited to provide extern al peer review of this systematic review ; AHRQ and an associate editor also provided comments. The draft report was posted on the AHRQ webs ite for 4 weeks to elicit public comment. We addressed all reviewer comments, revised the text as appropriate, and documented all responses i n a disposition of comments report made available within 3 months of the Agency posting the final systematic review on the Effective Health Care webs ite. 16 Chapter 3. Search Resu lts We identified 6060 unique citations (Figure 2) to May 2017 from bibliographic databases addressing drug , psychosocial for bipolar disorder (BD) . Fifty -six articles were added through hand search. An initial title and abstra ct review excluded 4,971 articles that were not related to drug or nondrug treatments for patients with BD . Full texts of 1,145 articles were reviewed to determine final inclusio n. Appendix D provides a list of articles excluded at full text. Figure 2 . Literature flow diagram We identified 188 unique publications eligible for inclusion, including 123 studies of drug treatments and their associated harms, and 65 focused on psychosocial and other physical treatments. An additi onal 62 publications, 57 drug and 5 psychosocial, were excluded for attrition greater than 50 percent; brief abstracts of these studies are provided in Appendix D . 17 Drug studies examined 28 separate drugs that were tested agains t 14 different types of comparators. These treatments and their comparators may have been single drug therapies or combination therapies of multiple drugs tested against either monotherapies or other multiple drug therapies. These then separated into 103 t reatment comparisons, 59 of which had only one study contribute information. For K ey Question 3, we found no studies meeting inclusion criteria that looked at treatments to reduce metabolic change side effects of drug treatments.

A somatic therapy intervention, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), was examined as a non psychosocial , nondrug intervention. Each study represented a unique comparison due to differences in the structure of each intervention and control/ comparator groups. Table 5 provides the included studies for each individual comparison for nondrug studies. Comparators are categorized as inactive (e.g., usual care, no intervention) or active (e.g., a different psychosocial therapy, peer support) to indicate whether the studies were measuring the efficacy or effectiveness of the intervention. Since the nondrug studies were not as clearly delineated by BD states, the table further breaks down the studies by study enrollment criteria. For example, some stu dies may have required a particular BD state while other studies accepted BD participants in any state while still others may have excluded participants with a specific state. 20 Table 5.

Drug Treatments for Acute Mania We identified 71 publications of 67 unique studies for acute mania that examined 28 separate drugs tested against 14 different comparators. These treatments and their comparators may have been single drug therapies or combination therapies of multiple drugs tested against either placebo monotherapies or other multiple drug therapies. The 67 studies combined into 56 treatment comparisons, 35 of which had only one study contribute information. Only three comparisons had four or more studies contributing. An additional 54 studies were excluded due to attrition h igher than 50 percent. The high attrition studies (greater than 50% were excluded because observed results among patients who complete a trial may not generalize to the entire patient population of interest if systematic differences between patients who do not complete the study and those who do (i.e., attrition is not random and/or likely due to bipolar disorder ( BD) or treatment- relevant factors) occur. Moreover, if there are differential rates of attrition across study arms, or even similar rates but a different distribution of reasons for attrition, primary effect estimates and statistic al inference can suffer from bias, potentially severe. The Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method\u2014by far the most common method used to address missing outcome data in the included studies \u2014requires an assumption that the health- status of patients w ho dropped out of the trial would not have changed had future observations been recorded. This is a particularly heroic assumption in the context of withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse events, not uncommon occurrences in the context of pharmaceut ical treatment of patients with BD. 23 When this assumption is inappropriate, use of LOCF methods can bias effect estimates. Moreover, estimates of standard errors will understate the true uncertainty surrounding effect estimates due to the added uncertainty of having to impute data, leading readers to believe the result is more precise than it actually is and potentially inflating the type -I error rate. 24 This potential bias in the estimates of effect is even more problematic in studies with greater than 50 percent attrition that require imputi ng half or more of the data. The results in this chapter for treatments for acute mania are organized by general drug category: antipsychotics , mood stabilizers, and drugs otherwise not specified. Within the antipsychotics section, results are presented by specific drug, then broken into single drugs compared to placebo or another drug, then, when appropriate, drug in combination with mood stabilizers compared to placebo or another drug. Likewise, the mood stabilizers and other drugs sections are presented first by single drug results followed by combination therapy results. Antipsychotic Drugs for Acute Mania Key Poi nts Most antipsychotic drugs had few studies to contribute to findings. Studies for antipsychotics plus mood stabilizers were even more sparse and scattered. Low-strength evidence shows improved mania symptoms for a ll Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved antipsychotics, except aripiprazole, when compared to placebo for adults with bipolar I disorder ( BD-I). For four of the antipsychotics w e were able to provide a point estimate. However, most manic symptom improvements were of modest clinical significance, with values that were less than the minimally important difference (MID) but still large enough that a reasonable proportion of participants likely received a benefit. 22 Low-strength evidence showed no statistical differences in acute mania symptoms between olanzapine and divalproex/valproate. The ability to draw stronger conclusions for antipsychotics was hindered by high attrition rates . Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions regarding antipsychotic drugs alone compared to placebo or antipsychotic drugs plus mood stabilizers compared with another drug for BD-I for the primary outcomes of interest ( response , symptom scores, and functi on). When reported, all comparisons tended to show no differences between groups in serious adverse events. Participants using atypical antipsychotics, except quetiapine, reported experiencing more extrapyramidal symptoms compared to placebo. Participants using haloperidol reported experiencing more extrapyramidal symptoms compared to other antipsychotics. Participants using olanzapine reported experiencing more clinically significant weight gain. Eligible Studies f or Antipsychotics Eight antipsychotic drug s were examined in 47 publications of 43 unique studies for BD patients experiencing acute manic events. Of these, seven are FDA approved for use in adults with BD study for aripiprazole plus mood stabilizers was also included for metaanalysis. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic treatment available since the late 1950's and a World Health Organization listed essential medicine , was FDA approved in 1986 for schizophrenia (not for mania in adults with BD). All were examined as single drugs and all but cariprazine were also examined as a treatment combined with mood stabilizers. The populations tested were BD -I patients , which is understandable given the BD -I diagnosis requires history of just one episode of mania. Only one study (for quetiapine) included adults with bipolar II disorder ( BD-II) or bipolar disorder not otherwise specificed ( BD-NOS ). No studies specifically assessed drug effectiveness in treatment of hypomania. The large majority of studies with usable outcomes were measured at 3 weeks duration. Appendix E provide s detailed evidence tables, summary risk of bias assessments, forest plots when appropriate, and assessments of strength of evidence for key comparisons and outcomes. A summary of findings with at least low -strength evidence for drug treatments for acute mania are provided in Table 6. Any intervention and comparison not listed in T able 6, or outcome not listed for an included intervention and comparison, was found to have an evidence base insufficient to draw conclusions.

If fixed effect models are used, which only all ows inferences for the specific participants in the specific studies, symptom improvements were seen. However, the improvement may not be clinically meaningful based on values that are less than the MID. The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) mean difference of 3.85 (95% CI 2.27, 5.44) is less than the MID of 6, and the Clinical Global Improvement (CGI) score mean difference of 0.44 (95% CI 0.25, 0.63) is less than the MID of 1. There were no differences between groups for serious adverse events. Aripiprazole Alone Versus Active Control Evidence was insufficient for all outcomes from two studies (n=674) to address whether aripiprazole was better than haloperidol for acute mania in adults with BD -I, due to mostly high study limitations and imprecise data.47, 48 Studies reported no differences between groups for response or remission rates and mixed results as to which dru g was favored. Akathisia and extrapyramidal symptoms were reported lower in participants using aripiprazole versus haloperidol; other harms or withdrawal outcomes were mixed.

Both studies reported no differences between groups in withdrawal rates, serious adverse events, or rates of akathisia. Aripiprazole Combination Versus Active Control Evidence was insufficient for all outcomes from one small RCT (n=42) to address whether aripiprazole with mood stabilizers was better than haloperidol with mood stabilizer for acute mania in adults with BD -I, due to high study limitations, unknown consistency, and imprecise data.51 The study reported response r ates in the 70 to 90 percent range but no differences between groups for mania symptom (YMRS) or CGI. Participants using aripiprazole reported experiencing more weight gain while participants using haloperidol reported experiencing more extrapyramidal symp toms. 27 Asenapine We identifie d three eligible publications reporting three unique RCTs of asenapine and one RCT examining asenapine with lithium or valproic acid for acute mania with at least 3 weeks followup.25-27 59 Two studies were assessed as low to moderate risk of bias27 59 and two were assessed as high.25, 26 No additional studies were excluded for greater than 50 percent attrition.

We found low -strength evidence that asenapine had a lower rate of wit hdrawal due to lack of efficacy than placebo (moderate study limitations, imprecision) . However, low -strength evidence also showed t hat placebo had a lower rate of withdraw al due to adverse events than asenapine (moderate study limitations, imprecision) . Over all withdrawal was less in the a senapine group, and favore d asenapine over placebo, but results were not statistically significant. There were no differences between groups for serious adverse events, although participants with asenapine had significantly more extrapyramidal symptoms than those on placebo. Asenap ine Alone Versus Active Control Evidence was insufficient for all outcomes from two studies (n= 763) to address whether asenapine was better than olanzapine for acute mania in adults with BD -I, due to high study limitations and imprecise data.25, 26 Studies reported olanzapine showed a greater response rate but no differences in remissions.

Mania symptom improvement was close to a MID (YMRS, mean difference 4.9, 95% CI 2.34 to 7.45).25, 26, 31, 33, 34, 45 CGI trended 33 toward improvement for olanzapine but did not reac h significance. Low -strength evidence (moderate study limitations, imprecision) also showed overall withdrawal and withdrawal due to lack of effect were lower for olanzapine. Withdrawal for adverse events did not differ between groups. While serious advers e events did not differ by group, participants using olanzapine reported more extrapyramidal symptoms and weight gain (at least 7 percent increase) than those using placebo. Olanzapine Alone Versus Active Control Low-strength evidence (moderate study limitations, imprecision) from four RCTs (n=867) showed no statistically significant difference in outcomes between olanzapine versus divalproex or valproate for acute mania in adults with presumed BD -I. 33, 44-46, 63, 66 No differences were noted in response or remission rates (n=635), mania symptoms (YMRS, n=750), CGI (n=578), or withdrawals (n=867). No differences were noted in serious adverse events. However, one study noted participants receiving olanzapine experienced more clinically important weight gain ( at least 7% ) than those receiving divalproex;33 a trend toward greater weight gain in olanzapine groups was noted in the other studies as well. Evidence was in sufficient for all outcomes from three RCTs (n=210) to address whether olanzapine was better for acute mania than lithium in adults with presumed BD -I, due to moderate study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision.60, 61, 64 The studies reported mixed results for response, mania symptom improvement (YMRS), or CGI. Withdrawals and adverse events tended to show no differences between groups. Evidence was also insufficient for all outcomes to address whether olanzapine was better than risperidone (one RCT, n=329), 89 or haloperidol (one RCT, n=453), due to single studies of moderate to high study limitations and imprecision.67 The studies reported no differences between groups for response, remission, symptom improvement, function, or withdrawals over 3 weeks. No differences between groups were noted in serious adverse events. However, participants using olanzapine reported more weight gain while pa rticipants using haloperidol reported more akath isia. Results for olanzapine versus asenapine were reported in the asenapine versus active comparator section above (e.g., evidence was insufficient for olanzapine compared to asenapine).

Two other studies examined olanzapin e plus divalproex (n=202)69 or valproate (n=80)46 compared to the mood stabilizer alone without a placebo present. One study reporting response and remission rates reported results favoring olanzapine, while both reported improvements in mania symptoms. Participants receiving olanzapine reported greater frequency of clinical ly important weight gain. No other differences between groups were noted in serious adverse events. Olanzapine Combination Versus Active Control Evidence was insufficient for all outcomes from one RCT (n=83) to address whether olanzapine plus lithium was better for acute mania than chlorpromazine plus lithium for adults with BD -I, due to a single study and imprecision. 68 The study reported no difference between groups for all outcomes including symptomatic recovery, response, remission, depressive symptoms, and CGI .

Low -strength evidence ( moderate study limitations, imprecision ) showed CGI improved for participants using quetiapine, but the improvement was about half t he MID (mean difference 0.54, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.74, n=806). Withdrawal due to lack of efficacy was lower for quetiapine but overall withdrawal and withdrawal due to adverse events did not differ between groups (low -strength, n=1,007). Most studies reported no serious adverse events and no differences between groups for extrapyramidal symptoms. One small study (n=41) enrolling patients with mild to moderate hypomania or mild mania also found participants using quetiapine showed improvements in manic symptoms (YMRS) and CGI. 39 Weight gain greater than 7 percent was infrequently reported but tended to be more common in participants using quetiapine.

No serious adverse events were reported. However, par ticipants using risperidone experienced more extrapyramidal symptoms than those using placebo. Risperidone Alone Versus Active Control Evidence was insufficient for all outcomes to address whether risperidone performed better than an active comparator for acute mania, due to moderate study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision. Findings were mixed from two studies comparing risperidone to haloperidol in adults with BD -I. 41, 96 Those who received risperidone also had lower total scores on the extrapyramidal symptom rating scale at 3 weeks compared to those who received haloperidol. 39 Withdrawal rate s were simi lar between groups. One study compared risperidone to lithium, finding no difference between groups in bipolar outcomes and extrapyramidal symptoms at 4 weeks.96 Withdrawal rates were not reported. Results for risperidone versus olanzapine were reported in the olanzapine versus active comparator section above and were determined to yield insufficient evidence.

Ne ither study reported serious adverse events. Haloperidol Versus Active Control Results for haloperidol versus aripiprazole were reported in the aripiprazole versus active comparator section above and yielded insufficient evidence. Mood Stabilizers f or Acut e Mania Key Points Studies for mood stabilizers were sparse and scattered. Evidence was largely insufficient to draw conclusions regarding mood stabilizers compared to placebo or other drugs for BD -I for the primary outcomes of interest (response , symptom scores, and function). Low-strength evidence showed lithium increased response and remission rates and manic symptom improvement in BD -I participants with acute mania compared to placebo. When reported, all comparisons tended to show no differences between groups in serious adverse events. Participants using carbamazepine reported experiencing more severe rash and adverse events compared to placebo. The ability to draw stronger conclusions was hindered by high attrition rates. 43 Eligible Studies f or Mood Stab ilizers Four mood stabilizers, all FDA approved for use in patients with bipolar disorder experiencing mania, were examined in 1 2 publications of 12 unique studies for BD patients with acute mania. All were tested as single drugs : carbamazepine, divalproex /valproate, lamotrigine, and lithium. All studies enrolled adults with BD -I. Only one study (for lithium) also included adults with B D-II. There were no studies assessing drug effectiveness in treatment of hypomania. The large majority of studies with usab le outcomes were measured at 3 weeks duration. Appendix F provides detailed evidence tables, summary risk of bias assessments, forest plots when appropriate, and assessments of strength of evidence for key comparisons and outcomes. A summary of findings with at least low -strength evidence for mood stabilizers for acute mania are provided in Table 21.

Withdrawal rates did not differ by group. Serious adverse events were inconsistently reported and showed mixed results. Lithium Alone Versus Active Control Evidence was insufficient for all outcomes from one RCT (n=270) to address whether lithium was better for acute mania than divalproex in adults with BD -I, due to a single study and imprecise data. 126 The study reported r esponse rate, symptoms (YMRS), CGI , and withdrawals did not diffe r between groups. One of two measures of remission showed benefit for divalproex. No differences in frequency of serious adverse events between groups were noted. Evidence was insufficient for all outcomes from one small RCT (n=30) to address whether lithium was better than haloperidol, due to a single study and imprecise data.96 The study reported no differences between groups in manic symptoms (YMRS) and CGI. Seri ous adverse events were not reported. 48 Risperidone versus lithium and risperidone versus haloperidol comparisons are discussed in the risperidone subsection of the antipsychotics section above. Also discussed above in the antipsychotics section are olanzapi ne versus lithium and quetiapine versus lithium. Overall, while all comparisons were assessed as having insufficient evidence, studies generally reported no differences between the antipsychotic drug and lithium. (The topiramate comparisons will be discus sed in the following section.) Drugs Not Approved by FDA f or Acute Mania in Bipolar Disorder Key Points Ten drugs were examined for acute mania with mood stabilizers. Low-strength evidence showed paliperidone improved manic symptoms over placebo in adults with BD -I, although the improvement was not a clinically important difference (n=763). Participants using 12 mg paliperidone reported more common akathisia and dystonia. Low-strength evidence showed topiramate was not significantly different from placebo for symptom improvement, and participants using placebo withdrew less for adverse events (n=876) in a dults with BD -I. In addition, low -strength evidence showed lithium significantly improved manic symptoms compared to topiramate (n=453) in adults with BD-I, although participants receiving lithium withdrew more for adverse events. Low-strength evidence sho wed allopurinol plus mood stabilizers/other psychotropic medications did not differ significantly from mood stabilizers alone for manic symptom or CGI improvement or overall withdrawals (n=355) in adults with BD -I. Evidence was largely insufficient to draw conclusions for all other nonapproved FDA drugs for BD -I for the primary outcomes of interest ( response , symptom scores, and function). Eligible Studies f or Drugs Not Approved by FDA Sixteen unique studies examined nine other drugs for patients experienci ng manic events .35, 103, 128-141 Four studies were assessed as low risk of bias,103, 129, 130, 135 ten were moderate,128, 132, 134, 136, 137, 139-141 and four were assessed as h igh.35, 131, 133, 138 Three additional studies were excluded for greater than 50 percent attrition.142-144 Eight studies were funded or assisted by industry.35, 103, 128, 135, 138-141 All but three studies128, 138, 139 used a placebo comparator.

Five studies examined the drugs as a single drug,35, 103, 129, 134, 140 while eight were added to mood stabilizers or other current psychiatric medications.130-133, 135-137, 141 Studies ranged from 3 to 12 weeks long. All enrolled BD -I participants. Low-strength evidence (moderate study limitations, imprecision) from two studies (n=763) showed paliperidone was better than placebo for improvement in mania symptoms (YMRS).35, 140 However, for the highest dose of 12 mg in the moderate risk of bias study, the improvement may not be clinically meaningful based on values that are less than the MID. The study reported YMRS mean difference of 3.4 (p=0.025), which is less than the MID of 6. While a dose response was su ggested, authors stated results were driven largely by participants in India, who comprised only 10 percent of the analysis set. Low -strength evidence (moderate study limitations, imprecision) showed no statistically significant differences between groups for withdrawal for lack of efficacy. Evidence for CGI and response and remission rates was insufficient due to moderate study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision. With the exception of more common akathisia and dystonia EPS symptoms for 12 mg paliperidone versus placebo, no differences in serious adverse events were noted Appendix G provide s further detail . Topiramate versus placebo was examined in a pooled analysis of four trials (n=876).103 Low - strength evidence (high imprecision) showed no differences between topiramate and placebo for manic symptoms (YMRS) or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy for adults with BD -I. Additiona lly, overall withdrawals and withdrawals due to adverse events were lower in the placebo group (low -strength evidence, high imprecision). No differences in severe adverse events between groups were reported. Appendix G provide s further detail . 53 Evidence was insufficient for all outcomes for the two drugs celecoxib129 and ta moxifen ,134 examined as single drug versus placebo for acute mania, due to single studies and imprecision. For adjunctive medications, low -strength evidence (mo derate study limitations, imprecision) from four RCTs (n=355) showed no significant differences between allopurinol plus mood stabilizers compared to mood stabilizers alone in manic symptoms (YMRS), CGI, or overall withdrawals. 130-132, 136 Evidence was insufficient for response (high study limitations, imprecision)131, 136 and remission (moderate study limitations, inconsistent, imprecision) rates.130, 136 No serious adverse event were reported. Appendix G provides further detail. Evidence was insufficient for all outcomes for dipyridamole ,136 donepezil ,137 or gabapentin133 plus lithium versus placebo largely due to single studies and impre cision. Evidence was also insufficient for all outcomes for one study of topiramate plus mood stabilizers versus mood stabilizers alone, although the general finding of no significant differences between groups was similar to the findings for topiramate as single drug. 135 Likewise, one study of paliperidone plus mood stabilizers, while in itself providi ng insufficient evidence, repeated the general finding of no significant differences between groups observed in comparison of paliperidone as monotherapy versus placebo. 141 Drugs Not Approved by FDA Versus Active Control Six trials examined drugs versus active comparators in BD -I participants, each a unique comparison.35, 103, 136, 138, 139 Study sizes ran ged from 30 to 388 and ran from 3 to 12 weeks. Low-strength evidence (high imprecision) from a pooled analysis of individual patient data from two trials (n=453) of topiramate versus lithium for adults with BD -I with acute man ia showed manic symptoms (YMRS) improved more with lithium and the difference was at the MID level (6.14, 95% CI 3.94, 8.34). 103 Overall withdrawals and withdrawa ls due to lack of efficacy did not differ between groups (low -strength evidence). However, less participants receiving topiramate withdrew due to adverse events (7 % vs. 3% ). There were no differences in severe adverse events between lithium and topiramate groups. Evidence was insufficient for all outcomes to address if endoxifen was better for acute mania in adults with BD -I than divalproex (unknown consistency, imprecise),128 or if paliperidone extended release was better than olanzapine139 or quetiapine (high study limitations, unknown consistency, imprecise) .35 Evidence was insufficient for all outcomes to address if allopurinol plus lithium was better for acute mania in adults with BD -I than dipyridamole plus lithium (moderate study limitations, unknown consistency, imprecise), or if topiramate plus risperidone was better than divalproex plus risperidone (high study limitations, unknown consistency, imprecise). 138 Interpreting t he Findings for Drugs f or Acute Mania All FDA- approved antipsychotics, except aripiprazole, when compared to placebo im proved mania symptoms for adults with BD -I (low -strength evidence ). For four of the antipsychotics we were able to provide a point estimate. Lithium also reached low -strength evidence for improving mania symptoms, however, studies for carbamazepine, divalp roex/valproate, and lamotrigine failed to reach sufficient evidence due to too few studies and imprecise results. Likewise, evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions for the efficacy of antipsychotics added to mood stabilizers. Except for the finding t hat lithium improved mania symptoms better than topiramate (low - strength evidence), e vidence from studies of drugs compared to other drugs , whether as single 54 drug or drug combinations, for treatment of acute mania was also insufficient to draw conclusions. Our ability to draw conclusions was hampered by the small number of studies and sample sizes to allow confidence in findings of no differences between groups. Study designs generally tested for superiority of one drug over the other, rather than noninferi ority of the tw o drugs. With noninferiority tests, if the relative equivalence of the performance of two drugs is not demonstrated strongly enough, nonequivalence cannot be ruled out; that is, the treatment effects of the two drugs are too different. Only two small studies attempted to address efficacy and harms for specific populations of interest, pregnant women with BD (lamotrigine), and BD patients with hypomania (quetiapine). Unfortunately, results for the effect of quetiapine treatment for patients with hypomania were not reported separately from patient with mild mania, thus no conclusions can be made. Similarly, the single observational study for pregnant women provided insufficient evidence to address whether lamotrigine provided benefits. Because of the weak evidence, there was little to be gained from the very few studies that did attempt post- hoc analysis of subgroups. Post -hoc analyses cannot reach the same level of strength of evidence due to the inherent higher study limitations from studies th at generated low -strength evidence for main findings would . Given the generally high levels of attrition observed in the included studies, results of any subgroup analysis of such a restricted set are even more suspect. Adverse events were somewhat consis tently reported for extrapyramidal symptoms, and clinically significant weight gain of greater than 7 percent, but otherwise variably reported. The harms findings from the included placebo -controlled studies were consistent with information currently repor ted by FDA labels . While most studies reported no differences between groups in studies comparing drugs to drugs, we noted a general pattern of participants receiving atypical antipsychotics experiencing fewer extrapyramidal symptoms than participants receiving other medications. The seventeen studies examining efficacy and comparing drugs to drugs of ten other medications, either as single drug or added to other psychiatric medications, largely yielded insufficient evidence due to a single study for each s pecific comparison, small sample sizes, and/or inconsistent findings. There were a few exceptions, such as a low -strength evidence that lithium improved manic symptoms more than topiramate, although topiramate had lower rates of withdrawal due to adverse events than lithium. There was also low -strength evidence for no group differences in examined outcomes for topiramate versus placebo and allopurinol plus mood stabilizers/lithium/other psychiatric medications versus these other medications alone. Low - stren gth evidence supported that paliperidone improved manic symptoms more than placebo, although the improvement was not clinically significant since it did not reach the MID. Several issues impact the applicability of the studies. Over three quarters of the s tudies also excluded participants experiencing a first manic episode and most enrolled participants were 30 to 50 years of age. Moreover, given the inclusion criteria and actual participant characteristics, it is not clear if the current findings extend to populations with first manic episodes, current comorbid substance use, or pregnant or nursing women with BD I, or older adults with BD -I. 55 Chapter 5. Drug Treatments for Depression Key Points Evidence for treatment of depression in adults with bipolar disorder (BD) with at least 3 months followup was very sparse. The effects of four drugs compared with placebo: memantine, lamotrigine, or antidepressants (paroxetine, bupropion, or both) drugs compared with other drugs: sertraline or venlafaxine w ere examined for depression in BD. Evidence was largely insufficient to draw conclusions regarding the effects of drug treatments for depression in adults with BD for the primary outcomes of interest (relapse, symptom scores, and function). Eligible Studies f or Depression Treatments We identifie d 11 eli gible publications reporting seven unique randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of drug treatments for depression in adults with BD with at least 3 months followup.145- 154 Two studies were assessed as moderate risk of bias and four were assessed as high. One additional study was excluded for greater than 50 percent attrition.155 All studies were funded in whole or part by government sources. No studies for lurasidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine, Federal D rug Administration (FDA) -approved for depress ion in BD, met the inclusion criteria of at least 3 months followup. Three interventions were compared to placebo147-150 and added to mood stabilizers while three were single drugs versus active comparators.33, 151-154 Sample sizes ranged from 49 to 366. A lso discussed is an additional RCT examining lithium in participants with BD with at least mild symptoms needing clinical care, as the majority of participants were experiencing depression symptoms .156 Table 28 summarizes the bipolar type and major inclusion and exc lusion criteria for each study. Appendix H provide s detailed evidence tables, a summary of risk of bias assessments, and assessments of strength of evidence for key comparisons and outcomes. Table 28.

Drug Treatments for Depression Versus Placebo Strength of evidence from three RCTs was insufficient to draw conclusions for the effect of depression treatments compared to placebo in adults with BD due to single studies and 57 imprecision. Each study with a placebo comparator addressed a different intervention for a different bipolar population; memantine versus pl acebo in adults with bipolar II disorder ( BD- II),148, 149 lamotrigine versus placeb o in adults with rapid cycling BD -II,147 and antidepressants versus placebo in adults with bipolar I disorder ( BD-I) and BD -II.150 All three studies reported no significant differences between groups for all outcomes. Information on adverse events was reported in two studies. Both reported no differences between groups for severe adverse events or withdrawal due to a lack of response or clinical worsening. 147, 150 Drug Treatments for Depression Versus Active Control Strength of evidence from three RCTs was assessed as insufficient to draw conclusions for depression treatments compared with other drugs in BD due to study limitations and imprecision. The t hree studies with active comparators addressed two comparisons for adults with BD -II and a current major depressive episode: a three arm study of sertraline versus lithium or lithium plus sertraline ,151 and two studies of venlafaxine versus lithium .150, 153 Reported results were mixed for treatment response or remission. All three studies assessed switching to hypomanic or manic states but found no significant differences between groups. Only one unidentified serious adverse event was reported across the three studies' total of 354 participants. Lithium Plus OPT Versus OPT Alone One pragmatic RCT enrolled 283 participants with BD -I or II who were at least mildly symptomatic, with clinical need, and randomized them to receive moderate -dose lithium plus Optimized Personalized Treatment (OPT) or OPT alone.156 OPT follows the Texas Implementation of Medication Algorithm, so participants were commonly using medicat ions other than lithium. While the population was not specifically identified as experiencing a manic state, and in fact 87 percent of the participants were experiencing a depressive state, the participants were not clinically stable and treatment was deem ed necessary to stabilize mood. Evidence for all outcomes was deemed insufficient due to a single study with too small of a sample size to test the finding of no difference between groups in CGI or need for clinical treatment adjustment. The study was not designed to test for nonsignificance between groups. The study reported fewer participants in the lithium group needed less atyipcal antipsychotics than those in the OPT -only group (48.3 percent and 62.5 percent, respectively). Appendix H provides detail s. Interpreting t he Findings for Drug Treatments f or Depression Evidence for drug treatment for BD depression is insufficient to draw conclusions . Only six RCTs that examined five unique comparisons for bipolar depression met in clusion criteria. These studies differed in their diagnostic inclusion criteria, but tended to recruit predominantly individuals with BD II or mixed samples of BD -I and BD II without examining the effectiveness of treatments separately for each bipolar sub type. Given clinicians' concerns about treatment - induced switching into hypomania/mania and other adverse events, it is notable that not all studies systematically reported adverse events. The few studies that did report adverse events tended to find no gr oup differences. Additional evidence is necessary to draw definitive conclusions about adverse events of drug treatments for bipolar depression. The degree and nature of the sparse and scattered studies is noteworthy. Often studies did not meet the review' s inclusion criteria of at least three month followup for depression, including studies for lurasidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine, which are FDA -approved for depression in BD. 58 Given the chronic nature of BD, it is doubtful that studies reporting effects for drugs with followup periods shorter than 3 months are clinically useful. 59 Chapter 6. Drug Treatments for Maintenance Key Points Evidence for maintenance treatments was scattered across 1 6 drugs administered alone or in combination therapy. Evidence was largely insufficient to draw conclusions regarding the effects of drug treatments for maintenance of euthymia in adults with bipolar disorders (BD) for the primary outcomes of interest (relapse, symptom scores, and function). Low-strength evidence showed longer time to recurrence of any mood state for bipolar I disorder ( BD-I) patients receiving lithium compared to placebo (n=1579) in followup up to 2 years . Participants receiving lithium reported more tremor than those receiving placebo. Evidence was insu fficient for all other outcomes across all interventions. Eligible Studies f or Maintenance Treatments We identifie d 44 eligible publications reporting 36 unique studie s with at least 6 months followup.56, 139, 157-192 Twenty -one studies, seven of which were three -arm studies, examined a single drug treatment for maintenance,56, 82, 99, 117, 124, 139, 160, 161, 164, 165, 167-173, 176, 178, 180, 181, 184, 187, 190, 191 and 16 examined drug combinations.88, 116, 160, 162, 163, 166, 174, 175, 177, 179, 182, 183, 185, 186, 188, 189, 192 Drugs examined included: ziprasidone. Fourteen studies were assessed as low or moderate risk of bias and 22 were assessed as high, generally due to attrition. O f 36 unique studies, 2 7 were industry funded. An additional 15 studies were excluded due to attrition over 50 percent and not using time to relapse outcomes. 74, 75, 81, 83, 86, 87, 95, 115, 119, 120, 123, 125, 193-196 Only two studies were not RCTs.176, 185 Sample sizes ranged fro m 25 to 1226; 17 studies were below 200 participants, ranging from 25 to 175. Study duration ranged from 6 months to 3 years, with 24 using followup of 6 months to 1 year. Appendix I provide s detailed evidence tables, summary risk of bias assessments, and assessments of strength of evidence for key comparisons and outcomes. A sum mary of findings with at least low -strength evidence for other drug treatments for maintenance are provided in Table 29.

Single Drug for Maintenance Versus Placebo Twelve studies examined nine different drugs versus placebo in participants with BD -I.82, 99, 117, 124, 139, 161, 164, 165, 167, 178, 180, 184, 187, 191 Five studies also included bipolar II disorder ( BD-II) 64 participants.117, 124, 163, 182, 183 Sample sizes ranged from 26 to 1226 and followup lasted from 26 weeks to 3 years. Low-strength evidence (moderate study limitations, imprecision) from six RCTs (n=1579) showed that adults with BD -I receiving lithium over a 2 year period had longer time to recurrence of any mood state compared to those receiving a placebo.179, 186 Since the time to event outcomes account for attrition, these were the only outcomes abstracted from these studies due to the high attrition rates. Evidence was insufficient for time to manic or depressiv e states due to mixed results. Participants receiving lithium reported more tremor than those receiving placebo. Otherwise serious adverse events did not differ by group. Appendix I provides detail s. Evidence was insufficient for all outcomes to address whether ten drugs were better than placebo for maintenance in adults with BD: (n=353).99, 184 Single studies, high study limitations, small sample sizes , and strong imprecision contributed to the insufficient strength of evidence rating . Except for divalproex, results were reported as favoring the interventions for time t o overall relapse. Where reported, participants using placebo experience less frequent severe events of tremor than those using divalproex, or less parkinsonism than those using olanzapine; otherwise, serious adverse events were generally not different bet ween groups. Appendix I provides detail s. While providing insufficient evidence to draw conclusions, one observational study was noteworthy for examining lamotrigine use in 26 pregnant women, recruited before conception or during first trimester, with any BD type. Women chose to discontinue all mood stabilizers or to continue on lamotrigine only. While women who chose to continue lamotrigine were less likely to have an unplanned pregnancy than those who discontinued all treatme nt. Risk of relapse was 3/10 women using lamotrigine versus 16/16 women who discontinued treatment. Single Drug for Maintenance Versus Active Control Fourteen studies (20 publications) examined 10 different drugs versus another drug.139, 157-162, 164, 165, 167-173, 178, 181, 184, 187, 190 Sample sizes ranged from 54 to 768 and followup lasted from 6 months to 3 years. Appendix I provides detail s. Evidence was insufficient for all outcomes to address whether carbamazepine (n=171),168-171, 173, 190 olanzapine was better than divalproex (n=251)82 for maintenance in adults with BD. Si ngle studies, high study limitations, small sample sizes , and imprecision contributed to the insufficient strength of evidence rating . Results were mixed across the studies. With the excep tion of participants using divalproex showing less akathi sia compared to those using lithium, no differences between groups were reported for serious adverse events.

Combination Drug Therapy for Maintenance Versus Placebo Thirteen studies examined nine different combination therapies versus placebo in BD -I participants88, 116, 163, 166, 174, 175, 179, 182, 183, 186, 188, 189, 192 Four studies also included BD -II participants.116, 163, 182, 183 Sample sizes ranged from 25 to 706 and followup lasted from 26 weeks to 2 years. Evidence was insufficient to address whether nine combinations performed better than placebo: aripiprazole plus mood stabilizers (n=771),175, ziprasidone plus mood stabilizers (n=240).166 Single studies, high study limitations, small sample sizes , and imprecision contributed to the insufficient stre ngth of evidence rating . Results were mixed across the studies and generally showed no differences between groups in withdrawals due to adverse events. Serious adverse events were also not different between groups. Combination Therapy f or Maintenance Versu s Active Control Three studies examined combination therapies versus active comparators in BD -I participants, each a unique, single study comparison.160, 177, 185 Only one study also enrolled 69 participants with other types of BD.177 Sample sizes ranged from 283 to 482 and followup lasted from 24 weeks to 2 years. Evidence was insufficient to address whether lithium plus valproate performed better than either lithium or valproate alone (n=330),160 quetiapine plus mood stabilizers performed better than lithium plus another mood stabilizer (n=482),177 or if aripiprazole plus valproate performed differently than aripiprazole plus lithium (n=283),185 generally due to high study limitations and imprecision. Overall, the trials reported no significant differences between groups. However, the three- group Balance study reported time to relapse hazard ratios favored lithium plus valproate over valproate alone, but did not significantly differ from lithium alone. Also, serious adverse events did not generally differ between groups. All studies reported at least one death, but not to significant differences between groups for such a rare outcome. Interpreting t he Findings f or Drug Treatment f or Maintenance The current evidence for drug treatment for maintenance in BD is largely insufficient to draw conclusions for a number of reasons . First, 36 unique maintenance studies examined 16 different medications often res ulting in a single study for a specific comparison for a specific followup duration. In addition, 22 of 36 of maintenance studies (6 1%) were rated as having severe study limitations (high risk of bias). Second, t he high rates of attrition often led to only one usable outcome measure\u2014time to recurrence of a bipolar episode \u2014since this metric accounted for high attrition rates by including information from participants who dropped out due to BD episode relapse. Moreover, 17 studies had small sample sizes of le ss than 200 participants and 24 studies (66%) had followup between six to twelve months, precluding conclusions for long- term maintenance for most of examined treatments. Third, differences in current bipolar phase criteria across studies, ranging from any current phase (i.e., depression, hypomania, or euthymia), remission from mania, remission from any BD episode, or response or partial response to a specific acute episode treatment, made it difficult to determine for whom findings might apply. Still, low -strength evidence showed a longer time to recurrence of any BD episode for lithium versus placebo treatment in adults with BD I during a two year followup. The evidence was insufficient for time to recurrence of depression or mania due to inconsistent findings. There was a greater rate of tremors but insufficient evidence for differences in other adverse events rates between lithium versus placebo treatment. In general, in single drug versus placebo comparisons, when reported, placebo showed less tremor than divalproex treatment and less parkinsonism signs than olanzapine treatment, but no differences in other serious adverse events. Also, comparisons between drugs and active comparators did not show differences in serious adverse events, except for less ak athisia for divalproex than lithium treatment. The nature of inclusion criteria and study populations limits the applicability of these findings for certain subpopulations of individuals with BD, such as individuals with BD II, older adults with any BD illness type, and individuals at the early stage of BD illness. For example, 20 studies included individuals with BD I only, while studies with multiple BD disorder subtypes did not report results separately by illness type. The majority of studies included y ounger adults with mean ages in 30s and early 40s. An additional eight studies excluded individuals experiencing first manic episode. Only two small studies looked at individuals with rapid cycling BD. Most studies did not examine whether the number of pri or manic or depressive episodes affected the efficacy of drugs during maintenance phase treatment. 70 Chapter 7. Psychosocial and Other Nondrug Treatments Key Points Evidence was largely insufficient to draw conclusions regarding the effect of psychosocial interventions compared with either inactive or active comparators for bipolar disorders (BD) for the primary outcomes of interest (relapse, symptom scores, and function). This include d the effect of interventions at specific phases (e.g., acute hypomania/m ania or depression). Low-strength evidence showed no effect of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT ) on depression or mania symptoms when compared with an active comparator. Low-strength evidence showed no effect of systematic/collaborative care on relapse rates when compared with an inactive comparator. Evidence was insufficient for all other outcomes across all interventions. Evidence was i nsufficient to evaluate other nondrug interventions. Eligible Studies for Psychosocial and Other Nondrug Treatments We i denti fied 63 eligib le publications that reported 48 unique studies (50 unique comparisons) on psychosocial interventions for BD. We identified one eligible publication on somatic therapy . We excluded six studies during the screening process due to an attri tion rate greater than 50 percent. We analyzed the eff ect of interventions by category and grouped studies based on whether they used an inactive (i.e., usual care) or active comparator. Included studies on psychosocial therapy examined varied interventions ranging from psychoeducation, CBT, systematic or collaborative care, family or partner interventions (FPI), to interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT). The one publication on somatic therapy examined r epetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Results are grouped by general outcome category: relapse, symptom scores (i.e., depression and mania symptoms), function, and additional outcomes (e.g., hospitalizations, suicide rates). None of the included studies reported harms, outside of limite d information on self -harm and dea ths reported by three studies. For the majority of included studies, the outcome reporting timepoints (6 months and beyond) represent the duration of the treatment and a followup period. For clarity, population/inclusion c riteria tables include the number of sessions for psychosocial interventions and the length of time for the intervention (e.g., participants received 12 weekly sessions). We did not aggregate or pool studies within intervention categories due to difference s across studies in inclusion criteria, active components (e.g., individual, group, or internet -based therapy modality), scales used for outcome assessment, and outcome time points. Thus the majority of intervention/ comparator/outcome comparisons were bas ed on single studies. Appendices J -P provide evidence tables, summary risk of bias assessments, assessments of strength of evidence for key comparisons and outcomes, and reporting for additional outcomes. We calculated effect size (Cohen's d) for individual studies in the appendix tables when sufficient data was available.

The majority of studies enrolled patients who were euthymic. Components of the psychoeducation included discussions about symptoms, medications, and relapse prevention. Formats for intervent ions included individual, group, and internet -based psychoeducation. Inactive comparisons included treatment as usual (including pharmacotherapy) and attention controls.

Reported results regarding the number of relapses were mixed across studies rated low or moderate risk of bias. Two studies reported that participants who had received psychoeducation had fewer relapses of any type at 2 years than those who received an inactive comparator . 198-200 Colom et al. also reported fewer relapses of any type for those that received psychoeducat ion at 5 years.200 However, Perry et al. (n=69) reported significance differences only for manic relapses at both 6 and 18 months, with fewer manic relapses in the psychoeducation group. Groups did not differ for depressive relapses at either outcome time point. 204 Smith et al.

The majority of studies enrolled patients without a current bipolar episode, while some did not exclude individuals based on the current clinical state except for acute mania. Com ponents of the CBT interventions varied (e.g., group vs. individual; 8 vs. 20+ sessions); however, common elements included education about BD , identifying symptoms, and discussing strategies for management and coping. The length of interventions also vari ed ranging from 8 weeks to 6 months. Inactive comparisons were generally defined as \"treatment as usual\", which generally involved medication and variable contact with a provider.

(n=68) reported no dif ference between groups across 6- 12 months.229 Bauer et al. (n=306) reported no difference between groups in depression at 3 years. However, while van der Voo rt et al. (n=138) reported no difference between groups at 6 months, there was a statistically significant difference at 12 months, favoring the interventi on.233 Rated high risk of bias, Simon et al. (n=441) found that there were less depression symptoms in the co llaborative care intervention group at 12 months. However, there was no difference between groups across the full 24- month follow -up period. Four low or moderate risk of bias studies reported no difference between groups in mania symptoms at their respective outcome time points.227, 229, 230, 233. Rated high risk of bias, Simon et al. (n=441) reported no difference between group in mania at 12 months, but less mania symptoms in the systematic/collaborative care group across the full 24 -month foll ow-up period.231, 232 Function Evidence was insufficient for the eff ect of systematic/collaborative care on gl obal function and other measures of function when compared with an inactive comparator due to unclear or inconsistent findings and strong imprecision. Four studies enrolling 597 participants reported measures of function. 227, 229, 230, 234 One l ow risk of bias study reported a measure of global function. The study reported no difference between groups at 6 months, but better function for those that received the systematic/collaborative care intervention at 12 months. 234 Four low or moderate risk of bias studies reported additional measures of function. No difference was found between groups in quality of life at both 6 and 12 months. 234 Similarly, no difference was found between groups in measures of mental function, physical function, and health and disability at 6 months.229, 230 Based on the data from Kilbourne et al. (n=68), no differences occurred between groups in mental function and ph ysical function at 12 months; however there was a difference in health and disability favoring the intervention. 229 Bauer et al. (n=330) found no difference b etween groups in physical function at 3 years, but reported a significant difference in mental function with better function in those who received the intervention. 227 Additional Outcomes Two low risk of bias studies reported additional outcomes related to hospitalizations. Simon et al. reported no difference between groups in number of psychiatric hospitalizations at 12 and 93 24 months.231, 232 However, Kessing et al. found that treatment with systematic or collaborative care resulted in a significant decrease in readmissio ns compared with the in active comparator . In addition, the cumulative duration of readmissions was shorter the in intervention group.228 One low risk of bias st udy reported information on deaths and suicide rates. Bauer et al. (n=330) reported no differences between groups in number of deaths. The study reported that one person who received usual care attempted suicide.227 Systematic or Collaborative Care Versus Active Control None of the eligible studies on systematic or collaborative care compared the inter vention with an active comparator. Family or Partner Interventio ns We identified nine publications reporting six unique studies on the use of FPI as a treatment for BD.235-243 Appendix M provide s evidence tables, summary risk of bias assessments, assessments of strength of evidence, and reporting for additional outcomes. We were unable to draw conclusions for FPI due to insufficient evidence. Family or Partner Interventions Versus Inactive Control We identified four publications reporting two unique studies on the eff ect of FPI compared with an inactive comparator . One study was rated low risk of bias.235 One study was rated moderate to high risk of bias due to differences reporting randomization and attrition across publications.238, 239, 242 Study sample sizes ranged from 58 to 92. Subjects in one study were euthymic while the other study enrolled participants with a current episode (depressive, manic, or mixed). The FPI consisted of either 6 or 12 weekly sessions. Inactive comparator comparator included treatment as usual and pharmacotherapy. Table 40 summarizes the key characteristics of the studies. Appendix M provides deta ils. Table 40.

Two studies enrolling 150 participants reported number of relapses.235, 239 242 Evidence regarding the effect of FPI on relapses was mixed. At 15 months, D'Souza et al. reported fewer relapses for those who received FPI.235 Miller et al. (n=92), reported no difference between groups in the proportion of participants that experienced recovery or time to recovery across 28 months. 239 In a high risk of bias publication, the study also reported that among the subset of 53 patients who recovered from their intake mood episode, there was no difference between those who received F PI (either individual or group) and the inactive comparator group in relapses across the 28 months of the study. 242 There was also no difference between groups in time to recurrence.242 Symptom Scores Evidence was insufficient for the eff ect of the FPI on depression and mania outcomes when compared with an inactive comparator due to unclear consistency and imprecision . One low risk of bias study enrolling 58 participants reported symptom scores and provided sufficient data to calculate effect sizes.235 D'Souza et al. found no difference between groups in depression 95 symptoms at 15 months.235 However, a statistically significant difference in mania symptoms was reported at 15 months, with those that received FP I experiencing less symptoms.235 Additional Outcomes One publication with high risk of bias reported information on hospitalizations.242 Among the subset of 53 patients who recovered from their intake mood episode, the study found that there was a significant difference between groups in frequency of hospitalizations. While the frequency of hospitalizations was relatively similar between those who received individual family therapy and those who received the inactive comparator , participants who received group family therapy had fewer hospitalizations. 242 Family or Partner Therapy Versus Active Control We identified five publications reporting four unique studies on the effect of FPI when compared with active comparator . Two s tudies were rated low risk of bias ,236, 237, 240 and two were moderate.241, 243 Study sample sizes rang ed from 53 to 101. The studies did not exclude individuals based on the current clinical state (i.e., including euthymic state or a current depressive, hypomanic, manic, or mixed episode). Three of four studies included psychoeducation as a component of the intervention. In addition, three of the four studies had an intervention span of 9 months. Active comparators included family education with crisis management, treatment as usual with enhanced assessment and monitoring, and individual treatment.

(n=101) had no difference between groups at 12 months; however there were fewer relapses at 24 months in participants who received the family/partner therapy.236, 237 In addition, Rea et al. (2003) (n=53) reported no difference between groups in number of relapses at 12 months; however there was a significant difference between groups in the 1 -year period post -treatment (24 months total) with fewer relapses reported for the FPI group.240 Symptom Scores Evidence was insufficient for the effect of FPI on d epression and mania symptoms , due to strong imprecision . Three low or moderate risk of bias studies enrolling 210 subjects reported symptom scores. Two studies were rated low risk of bias and two we re rated moderate risk of bias.236, 237, 241, 243 Only one study provided sufficient evidence to calculate effect sizes. Two studies reported a significant difference in depression symptoms at various time points, all favoring participants that received FPI.236, 237, 243 One study reported no difference in mania symptoms at 12 or 24 months.236, 237 Wenze et al. (n=30) reported a significant difference between groups at 6 months, with less manic symptoms i n the group that received FPI.243 In addition, Simoneau et al. (1999) (n=79) reported a generalized symptom score finding that participants who received FPI show ed a greater improvement in BD symptoms than those who received the active comparator at one year post -treatment. 241 Function No measures of global function we re reported. Evidence was insufficient for the effect of FPI on health and disability due to unclear consistency and imprecision. For other measures of function, one moderate risk of bias study of enrolling 30 participants reported that individuals who rec eived the FPI had greater improvements in health and disability at 6 months than those who received the active comparator . 243 Additional Outcomes One moderate ri sk of bias study reported information on emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Wenze et al. (n=30) reported that no significant difference between groups in either outcome at 6 months. 243 Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy We identified seven publications reporting two unique studies on IPSRT as a treatment for BD.244-250 Appendix N provides evidence tables, summary risk of bias assessments, assessments of strength of evidence, and reporting for additional outcomes. We were unable to draw conclusions for IPSRT interventions due to i nsufficient evidence. Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy Versus Inactive Control Five publications reported one high risk of bias study, the Maintenance Therapy in Bipolar Disorder trial, compared IPSRT to intensive clinical management.244-247, 250 Total enrollment for the trial was 181 subjects. The trial randomized patients to an initial 12 weeks of either IPSRT or intensive clinical management. All participants received pharmacotherapy. Patients were then randomized again after 12 weeks to 2 years of additional monthly sessions of either IPSRT or 99 intensive clinical management. Sample sizes across the public ations ranged from 32 to 175 participants. Table 42 describes the intervention and comparator. Appendix N provides details. Table 42.

Overall, the assignment of maintenance treatment had no effect on outcomes. Results at 52 weeks showed no difference between groups in risk of recurrence.247 At 2 years, there was no difference between groups in the proportion achieving remission.246 After 2 years of acute and maintenance treatment, no difference was seen between gr oups in depression or mania symptoms.244, 245 Global functioning was not measured. For non- global measures of function, receiving IPSRT as an acute treatment appeared to improve occupational functioning compared with intensive clinical management. However, the difference was lost after 2 years of maintenance treatment; occupational functioning across groups was ne arly identical. 246 The study reported reductions in the suicide attempts compared to the period before study initiation; however, groups did not differ in the num ber of suicide attempts. 250 100 Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy Versus Active Control Two publications reported one low risk of bias study, which compared IPS RT to specialist supportive care in 100 adolescents and young adults.248, 249 The trial randomized participa nts to either IPSRT or specialist supportive care, the latter consisting of supportive psychotherapy and psychoeducation.

However, groups di d not differ in social functioning at 6 months.248 At approximately 3 years (following an 18 month intervention and 18 month follow - up), the number of suicide at tempts and other self -injury attempts was reduced from baseline. There was no information regarding differences between groups in self -injury attempts.249 Combination Interventions We identified six publications reporting five unique studies on combinations of psychosocial interventions for BD .251-256 Appendix O provides evidence tables, summary risk of bias assessments, assessments of strength of evidence, and reporting for additional outcomes. We were unable to draw conclusions for combination interventions due to insufficient evidence. 101 Combination Interventions Versus Inactive Control Four publ ications reporting three unique studies examined the eff ect of combination interventions when compared with an inactive comparator.251-254 Two studies were rated low ri sk of bias,251-253 one was moderate,254 and one was high.253 Study sample sizes ranged from 40 to 122. Two studies did not exclude partici pants based on the current clinical state (i.e., including euthymic or a current manic, hypomanic, mixed or depressive episode). Components of the combination interventions used in the studies varied, with no consistency across the studies. One study used an online format. Intervention length ranged from 20 weeks to 6 months. Inactive comparisons were generally standard psychopharmacological treatment and clinical management without any form of psychotherapy. Table 44 summarizes the key characteristics of the studies.

While STEP - BD had three intervention arms , the primary aim of the study was to compare intensive psychotherapy to psychoeduca tion-based collaborative care. Whil e, the authors did report some response outcomes by individual intervention arm (provided in Appendix P ), the primary analysis of relapse/response and other outcomes like function are reported collapsed as only \"intensive psychotherapy.\" Table 46 describes the characteristics of these studies.

The study was rated moderate to high ri sk of bias study due to differences in reporting across outcomes (moderate for relapse, high for function). The study reported outcomes for relapse and function. Compared with the active comparator , a greater proportion of participants who received any ty pe of intensive psychotherapy recovered. Compared with the other three intensive psychotherapy interventions, a greater proportion of those who received family therapy recovered. In addition, those who received family therapy had the shortest time to recov ery. 261 However, these differences between the intensive psychotherapy interventions were not statistically significant.261 In a subset of patients who had been assessed for functioning at baseline, those who received the intensive psychosocial intervention showed statistically significant improvements in overall f unction compared with those who received the active comparator at 9 months.260 Of the therapies for the intensive psychosocial intervention, the family therap y group showed the largest improvement (mean change from baseline) in function. 260 Two low risk of bias studies examined the use of mobile devices for self -monitoring and self - management. Strength of evidence was insuffici ent for all reported outcomes due to strong imprecision. Depp et al. (n=104) randomized individuals to either self -management via mobile device or mood monitoring via paper and pencil, each f ollowing four sessions of psychoeducation.202 The study reported no difference between groups in depression and mania symptoms at 6 months. Faurholt -Jepsen et al. (n=78) randomized participants to use a smart phone for daily monitoring (including receiving clinical feedback) or for normal purposes. The study reported no difference between groups in depression, mania, global function, or quality of life at 6 months. 257 Somatic Therapy One study examined a somatic therapy approach . Table 47 describes the characteristics of this study . Appendix P provides evidence tables, summary risk of bias assessments, assessments of strength of evidence, and reporting for additional outcomes. Evidence was insufficient from one small, moderate risk of bias study (n=46) that compared repetitive transcr anial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to sham stimulation.262 At 4 weeks, there was no difference between groups in response or remission rates, or depressive s ymptoms in individuals experiencing a depressive episode.262 109 Table 47.

In contrast to previous reviews and metaanalyses, we separately examin ed studies by both intervention category and comparator type (inactive and active).263 We also considered the variation of interventions within categories and the variation across the clinical states of enrolled subjects. This limited o ur ability to draw conclusions from the available evidence. The evidence base had several limitations. Similar to the drug evidence, a substantial number of studies were excluded due to an attrition rate greater than 50 percent. While this limited the evidence, the findings from these studies were of questionable validity. Lack of transparency was also a significant limitation. Reporting of outcome time points, number of participants in each arm, and loss to follow -up was at times unclear. Studies inconsis tently used scales to measure symptoms of depression, mania, or function. Notably, some studies chose to measure global function while others measured qual ity of life or social function. We were unable to assess the impact of interventions on specific phas es of BD. The majority of psychosocial interventions studies did not exclude individuals based on their current clinical state, thus investigated mixed samples of individuals in acute hypomanic/manic, mixed, depression episodes, or euthymia. Studies invest igating the mixed samples did not examine whether the baseline clinical state affected intervention eff ect. Additionally, in several instances we could not abstract sufficient data to calculate estimates or verify conclusions presented by studies. Multiple studies provided only test statistics for outcomes without additional data (e.g., means at baseline and outcome time points, mean diff erence at outcome time points). The available evidence on other nondrug interventions such as acupuncture or light therap y that may be used to treat BD did not meet our inclusion criteria. Several studies were eliminated because they had high rates of attrition, sample sizes below 10 participants per arm, or did not meet timing criteria (e.g., 3 months for treatment of acute depression). High quality studies, with sufficient sample sizes and appropriate followup periods, are needed to determine whether these interventions benefit individuals with BD. 110 It is possible that psychosocial interventions provide benefits not expressl y or consistently measured in the reviewed literature. Many of the psychosocial interventions included common components of disease education, discussion of triggers, and coping mechanisms. If these common components are active ingredients of a therapeutic effect for psychosocial interventions, then the lack of difference seen in head -to-head comparisons of psychosocial interventions are not surprising; for example the low -strength evidence we found for no differences between CBT versus active comparator in reducing bipolar symptoms. Moreover, some of the outcomes assessed in psychosocial treatment literature, such as rates of relapses into manic or depressive episodes, require long followup intervals to adequately measure change in rates of events that for some patients occur only once every 6 -12 months. In other words, true treatment effects may be obscured in studies with followup shorter than 12 months. Finally, studies inconsistently reported other relevant outcomes, such as adherence to drug treatment, which can be improved through educational efforts that help patients accept their diagnoses and improve their coping skills .264 111 Chapter 8. Discussion Over view The evidence base for treatments for bipolar disorder (BD) is sparse and scattered. While a large number of studies were identified, they mapped across a considerable number of treatments and comparators, ultimately yielding few for each actual compar ison. We found no high or moderate strength of evidence for any treatment during any phase of bipolar illness (i.e., acute mania, acute depression, or maintenance). For treatment of acute mania, low -strength evidence was found for atypical antipsychotics c ompared to placebo for improvements in response and possible remission rates, and improvements in manic symptoms and clinical global impressions. (Table 48) There was also low -strength evidence for improved response and remission rates, as well as manic sy mptom improvement, for lithium versus placebo. However, most manic symptom improvements were of modest clinical significance, with values that were less than the minimally important difference (MID) but still large enough that a reasonable proportion of pa rticipants likely received a benefit . For maintenance phase treatment, only lithium achieved low -strength evidence for benefit for the long -term (1 -2 years). No treatments with even low -strength evidence showed favorable outcomes for treatment of depressio n. Across treatment phases, the large majority of drug comparisons, including almost all comparisons using active comparators, had insufficient evidence from which to draw conclusions. Table 48.

Inactive comparators are comparators such as usual care, scale Similarly, only a few studies of psychosocial interventions reached low -strength evidence, finding no differences between particula r psychosocial treatment approaches versus active comparators (e.g., another psychotherapeutic approach) for a subset of outcomes. Most comparisons had insufficient evidence to address whether the therapy of interest improves outcomes compared to either inactive (usual care) or active (another therapeutic approach) controls. However, the studies' inclusion criteria and limitations (see section below on limitations) preclude definitive conclusions about the effects of psychosocial interventions. We were unab le to draw a conclusion for several F ood and Drug Administration (F DA)- approved drugs for BD. One FDA -approved atypical antipsychotic, aripiprazole, had a limited number of studies and high risk of bias contributing to study limitations for mania treatment evidence. We noted that while a random effect model largely showed no difference between groups in response rates, manic symptom improvement, or withdrawal rates, if a fixed effect model is used, symptom improvements were seen, but at just over half the M ID. Fixed effect models only allow inferences for the specific participants in the specific studies, not generalization to the larger applicable population. One FDA -approved drug, chlorpromazine, was used as a comparator in only one study and otherwise not examined. A typical ( first generation) antipsychotic, chlorpromazine was approved by the FDA in 1957. The lack of chlorpromazine in the included literature reflects the treatment preference for a different typical antipsychotic, haloperidol, because of the sedative and blood pressure effects of chlorpromazine. Lurasidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine have been approved for depression in BD, based on 6 to 8 week studies, but no studies were identified with at least 3 months followup in this review. Table 49 provides a list of all comparisons in this review for which we were unable to draw conclusions. Notably, the insufficiency of the evidence does not indicate that the examined 114 approaches do not have therapeutic benefits, but rather that the scientific evide nce is insufficient to draw any conclusions about their therapeutic effects.

CBT=cognitive behavioral therapy ; CGI=Clinical Global Impression; IPSRT= Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy; OPT=Optimal Personalized Treatment Adverse events in drug studies were somewhat consistently reported for extrapyramidal symptoms, and clinically significant weight gain of g reater than 7 percent, but otherwise variably 116 reported. The harms findings from the included placebo -controlled studies were consistent with information currently reported by FDA labels . (Please see Appendix Q for drug label in formation on FDA box warnings and serious adverse events.) While most studies reported no differences between groups, we noted participants using antipsychotics, except quetiapine, reported more extrapyramidal symptoms compared to placebo, and those using olanzapine reported more clinically significant weight gain. For mood stabilizers, participants using carbamazepine reported more severe rash and adverse events compared to placebo. In head -to-head studies, we noted a general pattern of participants receiv ing atypical antipsychotics fewer extrapyramidal symptoms than participants receiving haloperidol. Unfortunately, psychosocial studies generally did not report attempting to collect harms or other unintentional consequences of receiving psychosocial treatm ents. Although we had originally anticipated parsing study findings across several populations and subgroups of interest to address K ey Q uestion 4, the vast majority drug treatment studies enrolled participants with bipolar I disorder ( BD-I). This held eve n for maintenance trials as many were extensions of trials with participants who had responded to treatment for an acute manic episode. Given the low to insufficient strength of evidence assessments arising from high study limitations and attrition for the main study research questions, any post -hoc analysis for subgroups would be by definition high risk of bias and not sufficient to draw conclusions. We were therefore unable to address how treatments may differ across different BD populations and subgroups . Likewise, we also did not locate any studies specifically testing interventions in BD patients to address drug treatment side effects for Key Q uestion 3. Applicability Applicability of the review findings is challenging. The trials for drug treatments us ed restrictive exclusion criteria. Over three quarters of the studies for mania also excluded participants experiencing a first manic episode. Moreover, given the inclusion criteria, it is not clear if the current findings extend to populations with bipola r II disorder ( BD II ), current comorbid substance use, pregnant or nursing women with BD I, or older adults (i.e., age 65 and over). Conversely, the psychosocial trials often did not provide detailed information on the participants and the lack of populati on description limits the ability to infer from the results. Such a mixed population may mask patterns of effect. With the current information, we cannot determine if or to what extent, this contributed to the few findings of nonsignificance between groups . Factoring in the issue of high attrition, trials with 20 to 50 percent attrition, such as were used in this review, at best provide an estimate of the effect of a treatment for participants who adhere to, tolerate, and, in some minimal sense, benefit from the treatment. However, at extremely high levels of attrition, even this interpretation is of limited value to clinicians . 265 If over 50 percent of patients do not finish treatment, and thus were not followed- up to the end of the trial, then the chances o f the trial results being applicable to a new patient would be less than half. Applicability drops even further when we recognize the original randomized sample excludes many subpopulations and co- occuring conditions which reduces how much the sample repre sents people encountered in regular clinical practice, Likewise, the maintenance trials are most applicable to people with BD -I who respond to initial treatment. 117 Findings in Relation to What I s Already Known The findings of this review are consistent with other systematic reviews of treatments for BD, although, given the attention this review paid to the role of attrition, more restricted in positive findings . Compared to published Cochrane reviews , our findings were generally consistent, although somewhat more conservative. We also found benefit for olanzapine and risperidone compared to placebo for mania, and benefit for lithium compared to placebo for maintenance. 266-268 Cochrane reviews have reported benefit for several additional antipsychotics compared to placebo for which we found insufficient evidence (aripiprazole, haloperidol as single drug and added to mood stabilizers, and olanzapine or risper idone plus mood stabilizers).266, 269-272 However, authors of these reports consistent ly noted issues with attrition and medication adherence may have impacted their results. Insufficient evidence for psychosocial interventions was consistent across all reviews .263, 273 Limitations of the C omparative Effectiveness Review There were several limitations of the review. The search strategy relied on previous published reviews to identify relevant studies published prior to 1994. The original date was chosen to reflect the change to DMS -IV diagnostic criteria for BD and to focus review resources on abstracting relevant studies rather than searches for ground that has been otherwise well -tread. We believe we have identified the relevant literature, but the possibility of missing a publication, particularly on lithium, remains. Several inclusion criteria may also have created limitations. We only included studies if the populations were exclusively diagnosed with BD, or if the bipolar subpopulation results were reported separately. While still relevant for drug treatments, psychosocial treatments in particular that were specific to depression or mania and combined in analyses participants with bipolar and nonbipolar diagnoses might not have been included in this review. Excluding all outcomes except for time -to-event outcomes from studies with greater than 50 percent attrition hindered our ability to address outcomes of interest that require longer fol lowup in studies of smaller sample sizes. However, as is noted in the section below on limitations of the evidence base, the missing data problems created by high attrition is a counterweight to this limitation. A recent overview of reviews from the International Society for Bipolar Disorders Task Force on Suicide in Bipolar Disorder found that while lithium or anticonvulsants are suggestive for preventing suicide attempts and deaths, more research is needed to before the effects can be confirmed. 7 Literature on harms was essentially based on identified RCTs. We required studies to be at least prospective cohort studies with comparator arms and clearly reported for BD populations. This led to a number of observational studies being excluded, including observational studies that looked at broad classes of drugs, or individual drugs across broad populations. We also chose minimum study followup periods of 3 weeks for acute mania studies, 3 months for depression studies, and 6 months for maintenance studies. Many studies for depression treatment and other somatic treatments, such as ECT or light therapy, were excluded due to too short of study followup. Given the chronic nature of BD, the clinical relevance of studies reporting the effects of treatments with shorter followup periods is questionable. For example, if a treatment response to depression is not sustained, does it matter if the initial response to one treatment w as faster than another? Moreover, in order to provide evidence that a treatment reduces bipolar episode relapse rates, a study followup longer than 12 months is likely 118 needed to capture frequency of episodes that may occur once or twice per year for some individuals with bipolar disorder. Limitations of the Evidence Base Even though we excluded studies with greater than 50 percent attrition (unless the outcome was time to relapse), one of the great challenges we confronted in conducting this systematic review was deciding how to interpret trial results in the face of often very high attrition rates. In the case of trials evaluating pharmaceutical treatments for acute mania, it was very common for anywhere from 10 to70 percent of randomized patients to not c omplete treatment for even 3 weeks trials. In principle, treatment discontinuation need not lead to trial discontinuation, i.e., dropping out of the study and subsequent missing data. A National Research Council (NRC) report on missing data in randomized c ontrol trials stressed the importance of continuing to collect data on patients for whom treatment is discontinued, be it due to lack of efficacy, adverse events, or other reasons. 259 Unfortunately, while the majority of reports did not explicitly comment o n whether treatment discontinuation implied trial dropout, we were generally left with this impression given the common reliance on last -observation carried forward (LOCF) techniques and usage of terms like 'discontinued' and 'percent completing trial'. This means that many, if not most, trials had dropout rates (with subsequent missing data) ranging from 10 to 70 percent. Moreover, trials did not provide details about when in the trial period participants' last observations were observed, other than genera lly after baseline. Given the frequency of measurements in these trials, dropout as early as the first week cannot be ruled out. It is well known that missing outcome data can pose a serious threat to both the internal and external validity of a trial. 265, 274 Some of this risk can be mitigated w ith appropriate analytic techniques. The appropriateness of different analytic methods depends upon the assumptions one makes, and the justifiability of these assumptions in the relevant context, about the missing -ness mechanism (the reason the data are mi ssing and the relationship between observed and unobserved data). Ultimately every approach will require untestable assumptions. However, the aforementioned -panel recommends that some analytic approaches, including LOCF, ought to be avoided as their validi ty depends upon categorically unreasonable assumptions. The LOCF method, while easy, requires an assumption that the health- status of participants who dropped out of the trial would not have changed had future observations been recorded. When this assumpti on is inappropriate, use of LOCF methods can bias effect estimates. Moreover, estimates of standard errors will understate the true uncertainty surrounding effect estimates due to the added uncertainty of having to impute data, and this increases as the nu mber of periods the value is carried forward increases . This can potentially inflate the type -I error rate. 24 Several authors h ave proposed guidelines for acceptable levels of attrition in RCTs. One guideline suggested that anything greater than 5 percent was cause for concern, and anything greater than 20 percent represented a serious threat to validity. 275 Although somewhat arbitrary, this is not without theoretical and empirical support. One simulation study found that, while there was only limited or even no bias in estimates of odds -ratios with attrition rates as high as 60 percent if the mechanism leading to the missing outcome data was unrelated to the value of the missing data (referred to as missing at random, or MAR), estimates were 'seriously biased' with even low levels of loss to follow -up when the mechanism for missing data was related to the value of the data (referred to as missing not at random , or MNAR).276 Missing at random is a hard assumption to make with a BD population. 119 On the other hand, it has be en argued that, taken in isolation, the overall amount of attrition in a trial is a poor measure of the level of threat missing data poses to the validity of a trial's conclusions.277 This is because the risk of bias also depends upon the size of the observed treatment effect, the reasons for attrition, the degree that attrition rates and reasons vary across arms, and many other factors that might be specific to a trial and intervention under study. Ideally trial reports would include a discussion of the results of sensitivity analyses performed to assess how, under a range of reasonable assumptions, observed levels of missing data might have influenced the pr imary results. However, such robustness -analyses were almost universally not performed. We were thus presented with the difficult task of trying to interpret the results of trials with often large percentages of missing outcome data and little to no information on how much risk this level of missing -ness posed to the validity of the trial's primary outcome estimates, statistical inference, and even qualitative conclusions. We acknowledge the extreme difficulty inherent in studying and treating patients with BD (see below for future research suggestions). Still, while it is reasonable to question the wisdom of the decision made in many of the trials to discontinue patients from the trial once they stop treatment (due to lack of efficacy or adverse events), th is problem is not limited to patients with BD. 23, 265 As a form of compromise, we used what we considered to be an extremely lenient set of criteria for evaluating risk -of-bias from attrition. First, we excluded any outcomes for which over 50 percent of the data was missing. In the context of pharmaceutical treatment of acute mania, if a trial had less than 50 percent attrition at 3 weeks but greater than 50 percent attrition after this, the former outcomes were included and the latter outcomes were excluded. Any trial with over 50 percent attrition by the first outcome was excluded entirely, but we present the a ttrition rates in the appendix. For studies with attrition rates between 40 to 50 percent, we considered the withdrawal rates to be a valid, poolable outcome but treated other outcomes and harms as suffering from a high -risk of bias. We note that this crit erion did not apply to time -to-event outcomes in trials where patients were discontinued after the event was observed, e.g., patients discontinued from follow -up after suffering a mood -episode in a maintenance trial studying time - to-mood relapse. The other major challenge of the evidence base was variability and potential accuracy of the diagnostic assessment methods during recruitment processes. Most studies used the DSM criteria current for the study period, but the methods and likely reliability of the p atient ascertainment varied. Often, detailed information on diagnostic assessment and statistics reporting interrater reliability were lacking. Given the debate whether the underlying mechanisms support the bipolar types as qualitatively and categorically different or lay on a continuum of the same psychopathological dimensions, it would be important to include more standard information about lifetime history of bipolar episodes assessment. There is also great difficulty in accurately diagnosing comorbid me ntal health conditions that were commonly treated as exclusion criteria, which also speaks for the need of standardized diagnostic assessments and reporting of interrater reliability statistics. Additional information and rigor in diagnostic assessment wou ld generate a greater sense of confidence about who the study participants represent. Other common limitations of health and medical research were also present. Industry funding for drug treatments was the most common source of funding. Publication bias for antipsychotics, antidepressants, and psychosocial interventions for depressive disorders has been documented. 278-281 Harms, particularly for drug trials, were va riably and inconsistently reported 120 in formats difficult to aggregate. Usual care was not well- described. Publications often incompletely reported study design and conduct. Future Research Since evidence- based medicine relies on three realms --evidence, clin ical experience, and patient experience-- insufficient evidence means decisions must be informed by the latter two realms. This is an unsatisfying position for both clinicians and patients. Additional research for pharmacological, psychosocial, and somatic treatment of various phases of bipolar disorders, especially maintenance and depression, is needed to provide stronger scientific evidence for clinical decisions in these instances. Since only low -strength evidence was reached for benefit or no difference between groups for any treatment, drug or psychosocial, essentially all K ey Questions would benefit from further research. Acknowledging the difficulty and unavoidable issue of withdrawal in BD treatment research, there are a few possible actions to take: (1) Examine clinical and demographic characteristics that may differentiate participants who withdraw from participants who complete, and incorporate these findings in caveats about potential conclusions of treatment effects. Increased awareness of the cl inical and demographic predictors of withdrawal are likely to lead to new studies that can attempt to better address treatment for these specific subsets of population. (2) In combination with examining predictors of withdrawal, it is imperative to better assess reasons for withdrawal of consent and more systematically report reasons outside of side effects and lack of efficacy. Currently, often the reasons for withdrawal of consent are not provided, or are unsatisfyingly vague. (3) If high attrition rates exist in a study, performing sensitivity analyses to determine how different assumptions about missing data would affect the effect size and corresponding confidence intervals would be important prior to drawing conclusions based on the existing data. For example, if minor adjustments in the assumptions about the missing data (e.g., adjustments in symptom severity of potentially missing data) would eliminate the treatment effects in a particular study, this should lead researchers to be highly skeptical of such findings. (4) Assuming some indications that attrition was random, certain statistical techniques are more adapt at modeling missing data and not unduly influencing the results, such as average score/observation method or use of multilevel linear mixe d modeling. Future studies of BD treatments will require innovative ways to increase study completion rates (e.g., use of technology for followup assessments and study reminders; \"smart\" bottles, mobile apps, and pills for assessing study drug adherence; m ultiple secondary contacts for participants and all -inclusive contact information from cell phones, email, to social media; flexible scheduling outside of business hours, availability at the last minute notice). For example, more longitudinal data analysis techniques for intermittent follow -up would help, but that in turn generates the need for more effort to create data repositories that allow individual patient -level data pooling of these longitudinal studies. This also requires greater funding for resear ch with longer study followup duration. Future research also needs to atten d to subpopulation analyses. It is clinically useful to know what treatments are more effective for patients with early (prior to age 18) versus later age of BD illness onset, older adult patients versus younger adult patients, patients with BD -I versus BD -II or bipolar disorder not otherwise specified ( BD NOS ), patients with comorbid substance use disorders versus without this comorbidity, or patients with specific demographic chara cteristics. The lack of evidence for specific subpopulations of patients with BD is a direct result of prevailing inclusion and exclusion criteria. For example, the majority of BD treatment studies 121 have focused on individuals with BD -I diagnoses. While thi s practice is understandable for studies focusing on the mania treatment effect, it is less clear in cases of maintenance or depression treatment. Future research should also endeavor to enroll people with different initial episodes and maintenance stages to fully understand the spectrum of responses. Attention should be given to addressing all states of the illness throughout the treatment stream. Different clinical states could use more attention. For example, is maintenance after acute mania versus a depression episode the same? Does maintenance after an acute episode differ from patients \"off the street\"? We need to understand the nature of the interventions within the context of clinical practice (co- treatments). Psychosocial therapies also need to ad dress whether people with BD can benefit from a generalized groups without manualized treatment, or if the treatments need to be specifically designed for BD. For certain psychosocial therapeutic treatments, particular bipolar states may not be as relevant . But where targets are based on theorized mechanisms that are likely to affect manic or depressive symptoms, the populations should match the mechanisms so the study can directly address the question. Psychosocial studies were more likely than drug studi es to have inclusive inclusion criteria, but still outcome results were often not repor ted separately by BD subtype. Failure to assess subjects based on the current clinical state (i.e., including individuals who are currently euthymic, in acute mania/hypo mania, in a mixed state, or in acute depression) may have wash ed out any effects that interventions may have had for a subset of the sample (e.g., any improvements in depression symptoms for individuals in acute depression at the baseline). With the possible exception of treatment of acute depressive episodes, most psychosocial interventions for people with BD are designed to be used in concert with other - generally pharmacologic - treatments, and not stand on their own as complete treatments of the syndrome. So perhaps it is unrealistic to look too closely at \"effects on symptoms\" of psychosocial and behavioral interventions in isolation. B eyond simply augmenting medication effects, behavioral interventions can enhance adherence to treatment, reduce family friction, and promote hopefulness in patients and their families and friends. Consistent collection and reporting of other relevant outcomes, such as adherence to drug treatment, which can be improved through educational efforts that help patients accept their diagnoses and improve their coping skills 258 would be beneficial. Consistent minimum outcome datasets for BD research (and report inter -rater reliability of measures used in the study) would help, including harms or unintended consequences for psychosocial interventions. Consistent minimum methodological rigor is also required at the journal level. Conclusions No high or moderate -strength evidence was found for any intervention to effectively treat any phase of any type of BD compared to placebo or an active comparator. Low-strength evidence showed improved mania symptoms for a ll FDA -approved antipsychotics, except aripiprazole, when compared to placebo for adults with BD -I. Participants using antipsychotics, except quetiapine, reported experiencing more extrapyramidal symptoms compared to placebo, and those using olanzapine reported experiencing more clinically significant weight gain. Low - strength evidence also showed benefit from l ithium in the short -term for acute mania and longer time to relapse in the long -term versus placebo in adults with BD -I. Evidence was insufficient for 122 most nondrug interventions. Low -strength evidence showed no effect for CBT on bipolar symptoms compared with active comparators, or systematic/collaborative care on relapse compared with inactive comparators . We were unable to address questions on subpopulations or treatments to reduce the metabolic change side effects of first line drug treatments . Future studies of BD treatments will require innovative ways to increase study completion rates. 123 References 1. American Psychiatric Association.

Publication bias for antipsychotics, antidepressants, and behavioral interventions for depressive disorders is suspected. 2. Data were generally imprecise due to missing data from high att rition rates, which was commonly dealt with by Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF). LOCF requires an assumption that the health status of patients who dropped out of the trial would not have changed had future observations bee n recorded, a strong assum ption in the context of bipolar disorder research.

FDA box warnings for drugs used for bipolar treatment Drug Box Warning Aripiprazole Increased mortality in elderly patie nts with dementia related psychosis. IRisk of suicide among adolescents. Asenapine Increased mortality In elderly patients with dementia related psychosis. Carbamazepine Risk of suicide. Serious, sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions reported, including toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens -Johnson syndrome. Risk 10x greater in some Asian countries; strong associated between risk and HLA -B*1502 allele, which is found almost exclusively in Asian patients. Transient or persistent decreased platelet or w hite blood cell counts not uncommon with carbamazepine but majority of leukopenia cases do not progress to aplastic anemia or agranulocytosis. Perform baseline and periodic hematological testing. Consider discontinuing treatment if evidence of significant bone marrow depression. Cariprazine Increased mortality In elderly patients with dementia related psychosis. Lamotrigine Risk of suicide. Serious skin rashes. Lithium Lithium toxicity can occur at doses close to therapeutic levels. Facilities for promp t and accurate serum lithium determinations should be available before initiating therapy. Olanzapine Increased mortality In elderly patients with dementia related psychosis. When used in combination with fluoxetine also warn against suicidality and antid epressant drugs. Quetiapine Increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia related psychosis. Risk of suicide among adolescents. Risperidone Increased mortality In elderly patients with dementia related psychosis. Q-2 Drug Box Warning Valproic acid/ valproate/ divalproex (same for all) Risk of suicide. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity has occurred, usually during first six months of treatment. Patients <2 years old are at increased risk, especially with the following comorbidities: multiple anticonvulsant treatment, c ongenital metabolic disorder, severe seizure disorder with mental retardation, or organic brain disorders. Increased risk of acute liver failure and death in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma gene mutations (e.g. Alpers Huttenlocher Syndrome). Fetal risk via major congenital malformations including neural tube defects and decreased IQ scores after in utero exposure. Life threatening pancreatitis including hemorrhagic cases with rapid progression from initial symptoms to death reported in children and adults. Ziprasidone Increased mortality In elderly patients with dementia related psychosis. Allopurinol None Bupropion Risk of suicide among adolescents. Serious neuropsychiatric events have been reported in patients taking bupropion for smoking cessation. Celecoxib May cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke. This risk may increase with duration of use. Patients with cardiovascul ar disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease may be at greater risk. Increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, particularly in elderly patients. Citalopram Risk of suicide among adolescents. Dipyridamole None Donepezil None Fluoxetine Risk of suicide among adolescents. Gabapentin Risk of suicide. Haloperidol Increased mortality In elderly patients with dementia related psychosis. Memantine None Oxcarbazepine Risk of suicide. Paliperidone Increased mortality In elderly patients with dementia related psychosis. Paroxetine Risk of suicide among adolescents. Perphenazine Increased mortality In elderly patients with dementia related psychosis.
