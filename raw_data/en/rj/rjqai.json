We are excited that you are a stu dent in our professional program and I want to provide for you some inform ation that I hope will be of assistance to you during your academic journey with us. A very important person during your time with us is yo ur advisor. This individual is available to assist you in planning your program of studies and answer questio ns about future career options. I urge you to meet regularly with your advisor especially if you hav e any questions, concerns or need help with any academic, College, or campus issues. Faculty and st aff are prepared to work with you on an individual basis and help guide you through your journey with us. Additional career information can also be found in our Administrative Offices in Fargo - Sudro 123 and by attending our Annual Career Fair in September. The professional curriculum is designed to cha llenge you and to teach you to become an independent learner and to work in collaborative interprofessional healthcare teams. Theref ore, students are expected to take a very active role in their education and take responsibility for their own learning. Student active learning is a major emphasis of our program. You will be asked to apply your knowledge, dig for the answers to questions, communicate both verbally and in writing, critically think and problem-solve through case discussions, practice team-based care with st udents from other disciplines, and participate in numerous experiential activities. I encourage you to a sk questions in class and to learn by understanding and applying the material presented rather than by simp ly memorizing factual information. The goal of our curriculum is for you to achieve the necessary life-l ong learning skills which will become important to you in your future career as a health professional to be able to \"keep up\" with the plethora of new information associated with our rapidly changing health care sy stem. Your ultimate success will be determined by the amount of effort you are willing to put into your acade mic studies. So work hard and give your best effort in all that you do. If you give us your best, you w ill receive the best in your educational experience with us. It will also be important that you learn more than just the technical skills of practicing in your discipline but that you also learn what it means to become a health professional and practice professionalism in every and all situations. You will need to learn how to practice ethically, responsibly, with honesty, integrity, and good moral character and treating others (e specially your patients) with compassion, caring, understanding, and respect which is expected of any heal th professional. These will be the keys to your future success as a health professional. We desire to provide a positive learning environment for all students here within the College and we strive to continually improve our program. Students are a very important part of this process and we actively solicit your input and active participation through vari ous formats. Students are elected from each class to serve on the Dean's Student Liaison Committee. This committee meets with the Senior Associate Dean throughout the year to bring student concerns to t he attention of the administration. In addition, the College holds a Deans' Open Forum each semester to allow students an opportunity to interact directly with the Dean (and his administrative leadership team) on matters of interest and concern to students. And I also want you to know that my door is always open to you, so please don't hesitate to stop by my office if you need my assistance for anything. We enc ourage you to use these sources as well as visits with faculty, or any of the members of the staff in our Administrative Offices whenever you have issues that need to be brought to our attention. In additi on, I encourage you to become actively involved with your profession by joining one of our student professional organizations. This is a great way to learn about what's going on within your profession and begin contributing to the advancement of your future professional career and practice. This \"Handbook\" is devoted to academic inform ation to help enhance student success within our program. We hope you find it helpful to you. I wish yo u much success in your educational pursuits with us and in your later professional practice. Best wishes to you for a successful year! Charles D. Peterson, Pharm.D. Dean, NDSU College of Health Professions 4 GENERAL FAQ AN INFORMAL GUIDE: The following is a series of informal responses to questions most frequently asked about rules and procedures at NDSU. For further in formation, please refer to the current NDSU Bulletin (www.ndsu.edu/bulletin/ ), your adviser, Administrative Office in Sudro 123, the Office of Registration & Records in Ceres 110, or One Stop in the Memorial Union. ACADEMIC ADVISORS Who is my advisor? Pre-pharmacy students should reach out to pre-pharmacy advisor Kelly Haugen Friesner. Students in the professional pharmacy program are assigned an adviser. It is important to meet with your advisor on a regular basis to receive up dated curricular information. Advisors help students learn how to complete the registration procedures. Students are responsible for the course and program selections which they make . However, an advisor is a valuable source for acquiring information about the advisability of student choices. (If you desire a change of advisor, please contact the Senior Associate D ean, School of Pharmacy, 231-7601.) Do I need to see my advisor about my semester schedule? Yes, make an appointment with your adviser during advising week to plan your schedule of classes. Dates for advising and registration are available on the Office of Registration & Records web site ( www.ndsu.edu/registrar ) and \"The Spectrum,\" published twice per week when full semester classes are in session. CREDITS How many credits do I need to be a Sophomore, a Junior and a Senior? You need 27 credits to be classified as a Sophomore, 60 credits to be classified as a Junior, and 90 credits to be classified as a Senior. To graduate, you must successfully co mplete all general education requirements, the requirements in your major, and with a minimum of 2. 0 grade point average. A complete list of University requirements for graduation is in the current NDSU Bulletin. What is the limit on the number of credits I can take per semester? Full-time students will carry from 15 to 19 credits per Semester. Registration for mo re than 20 credits is not recommended. Special permission from your adviser and a grade point average of at least 3.0 are required to register for more than 20 credits. You must obtain a \"Petition to Enroll in More Than 20 Credits\" form under the link, \"Over 20 Credits Petition,\" at www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms . How many credits will I lose when I transfer to NDSU from another school? Ordinarily you shouldn't lose any. However, a \"D\" grade in any course does not transfer to the College of Health Professions. Some technical courses may not fit your degree program and in this case some extra work may be required. For evaluation of transfer credit see current NDSU Bulletin. How many credits can I transfer from a junior or community college? All college-level credits from regionally accredited institutions transfer; however, not all may apply to the particular degree program you have selected. To obtain a baccalaureate degree you mu st complete at least 60 semester credits at a four-year college or university. At l east the last 37 of these credits must be at the junior or senior level. (See current Bulletin.) How do I challenge a course? A student who is currently registered may seek credit by challenging a course. A course challenge usually consists of a special comprehensive examination; however, additional types of performance may be required for so me courses. A course challenge is only permitted for courses in which the student has not received transfer credit or has no previous academic record. Prior registrations are allowable if course was drop ped prior to the No Record Drop deadline in a given term. Student must be registered at NDSU during the se mester in which you wish to challenge a course (see current NDSU Bulletin for complete descriptions) . Procedures for pursuing a course challenge may be found at: www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/regist rar/forms/challenge.pdf 5 Is it possible to obtain college credits by taking examinations of the College Entrance Examination Board (CLEP and AP)? Yes. Students may demonstrate evidence of college-level achievement through the use of natio nally standardized tests. Competen cy to write these examinations may have been gained through intensive preparation in high school, extensive reading in a particular field, or other types of formal or informal preparat ion. A student may not repeat by proficiency testing a course that has been previously taken or failed at ND SU or another accredited in stitution. Score reports must be sent directly to NDSU from the awarding agency/board. School reports and student-issued grade reports are not considered official for purp oses of awarding credit by examination. DEGREES (CURRICULUM REQUIREMENT) How do I petition for a waiver or substitution of a curriculum requirement? To petition, you must obtain a \"Request to Waive or Substitute Courses\" form under the link, \"Subst itute/Waive a Course\" at www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms . In this petition, which is presente d to the Academic Affairs Committee of the College of Health Professions, you state exac tly why you think you should have a waiver. The Committee will review your petition and you will be no tified of their decision. (Petitions should be submitted only when special circumstances make it virt ually impossible for you to meet the regular degree requirements.) Only departmental and college requirements may be waived. University requirements may not be waived. GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS Who must complete the General Education Requirements? The General Education Requirements apply to all students. What are the General Education Requirements? The General Education Requirements are listed in the current NDSU Bulletin. A list of the courses ap proved for the different categories is provided at www.ndsu.edu/regist rar/academics/gened. General Education transfer with the ND University System. Students who plan to transfer from one institution to another in the ND Univer sity System should check with Office of Registration & Records in Ceres 110 or One Stop in the Memorial Union. GRADES AND ACADEMIC STATUS What is the G.P.A.? Grade Point Average. For each credit of \"A\" you receive four (4) honor points; three (3) for each credit of \"B\"; two (2) for each credit of \"C\"; one (1) for each credit of \"D\"; and zero (0) for each credit taken in which a grade of \"F\" is received. The GPA is computed by dividing the total number of honor points earned at NDSU by the total number of credit hours in which honor points were recorded. For example, a person with a G.P.A. of 3.00 has a gr ade average of \"B.\" The minimum GPA of 2.00 is required for graduation. Developmental course s do not count toward graduation requirements. If I do not do well in a course, may I take it over again? Yes. The second grade, whether higher or lower, will replace the first grade in computing the GPA. Both grades are listed on your Permanent Record. To replace a grade for a course taken at NDSU, that course MUST be repeated at NDSU. The one exception is that NDSU students may register for a Tri-College course to repeat a course previously taken at NDSU. NOTE: PROFESSIONAL COURSES IN THE PHARMACY PROGRAM - please refer to Policy #3.24, Repetition of Professional Courses, in the College Policy Manual. NOTE: PRE-PHARMACY CORE COURSES, Policy #2.21.1 - The total number of pre-pharmacy core courses which may be repeated shall be limited to th ree. The grade received during the student's final attempt for any core pre-pharmacy course will be used in evaluation for admission. A withdrawal is not considered an attempt. A core course is one that is included in the GPA for admission purposes. CURRENT COMPETENCY, Policy #2.28 - Coursework in the areas of science and mathematics must be no more than seven years old at the time of app lication to the professional program. Coursework presented in these areas that is older than sev en years must have current competency demonstrated. Current competency may be demonstrated by a) retaking a portion of the series in question, i.e. 122 of 6 121/122 Chem series; b) enrolling in a formal audit that is indicated on a student's official transcript; c) challenging coursework through the department in questi on; or d) meeting with faculty in the areas of Science or Mathematics and having them determine cu rrent competency. Students who intend to meet current competency requirements using item c or d mu st receive approval from the Chair of Pharmacy Admissions Committee prior to undertaking the current competency. (This coursework does not fall under the rule, \"Repetition of Pr e-Pharmacy Core Courses.) Will I receive mid-term grades? Upon request, all instructors shall inform students directly of their approximate mid-term grades before the end of the eighth week of the semester. MAJOR/MINOR How do I change my major? Occasionally students find they are not suited for a particular field. If you decide to change majors while you are a student in the College, you are expected to follow this procedure: discuss it with your adviser, fill out the electronic form \"Major/Minor and Adviser Change Form,\" www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms . You will be assigned a new adviser in the field in which you will be majoring. Once you select a major, you must transfer to the college that offers the major. How many credits are required for a Minor? The number of credits required for a minor varies by departments. The minimum number of credits for a mi nor is 16. To determine the exact number of credits that you will need for a minor, check with your adviser , or in Ceres 110 or One Stop. ENTRY-LEVEL DEGREES An entry-level degree is a degree program that a st udent who has graduated from a U.S. K-12 system and is newly admitted to NDSU can purse directly out of high school.

STUDENT CAREER COMMITMENT STATEMENT \"I understand that the healthcare care er I have chosen comes with certai n risks that could expose me to potential hazards to my health as a result of workin g in a healthcare workforce environment including but not limited to hazardous substances, dangerous equipm ent and supplies, mentally and physically ill patients, and possible exposure to blood and body fluids which may result in exposure to and/or contraction of an infectious disease. I fully understand these ri sks and accept them as a condition of being a student enrolled in a healthcare field like the Pharm.D. progra m. I understand that any medical expenses incurred as a result of the training port ion of the Pharm.D. program especially in the healthcare workforce environment, are my responsibility. I also understand that it is my per sonal responsibility to practice good accident and injury prevention measur es to reduce my risk of injury or illness including following all prevention and safety guidelines recommended by the College, the healthcare facility, and the Center for Disease Control.\" STUDENT ACADEMIC AND CONDUCT STANDARDS POLICY 3.01 Note: Due to changes in College of Health Profes sions Administration, effective July 1, 2020, the positions of Senior Associate Dean and Asso ciate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development mentioned in this policy are the same individual (Dr. Dan Friesner). Introduction 11 The mission of the NDSU College of Health Professi ons is to educate students and advance research and professional service in pharmacy, nursing, allied scienc es, and public health. The College has established professionalism and ethics as two of its core values. Pharmacists, nurses, allied health ca re professionals, public health professionals, and pharmaceutical scientists must live up to the high ideal s of their profession. T heir lives must be guided by the principles of honesty and integrity, in order to ensure that the public can regard their words and actions as unquestionably trustworthy. To develop an understanding of and respect for these prin ciples of honesty and integrity as applied to the academic work of pharmacy, nursing, allied science , and public health students, the College of Health Professions has developed this student conduct poli cy. This policy is applicable to anyone enrolled as a student in the College, including those in the pre-prof essional, professional, and graduate programs. This policy also applies to any student taking a course for credit in the College. Acceptance of this policy is required as a condition of admission to the College. Academic Standards The academic standards of the College of Health Pr ofessions differ from those of the University. Any student who fails to meet or exceed the University standards may be placed on University probation or suspension (see the current NDSU Bulletin for university information on academic deficiencies). Semester Grade Point Average (All Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all undergraduate and professional students shall main tain a semester grade point average of 2.00 or above for each semester enrolled in the College of Health Professions. All graduate students are expected to maintain a 3.0 grade point average as well as any other academic policies outlined by the graduate school. Any student who fails to attain a semester GPA of 2.0 or above may be placed on College probation. Students who have been placed on academic probati on for two (2) consecutive or three (3) non- consecutive semesters shall be suspended from enrollment in the College. After two suspensions, students will be terminated from the College. (Ter mination from the College does not prohibit the student from registering elsewhere in the University provided the academic standards of the alternate college of registration have been met or exceeded.) A student who is suspended and desires readmission into the College must file a request for re- admittance with the Senior Associate Dean at least 60 day s prior to the beginning of the semester in which readmission is sought. In addition, professional students must seek readmission to the professional programs in Pharmacy, Nursing, Allied Sciences, and Public Health through the Admissions Committee of their respective program. Minimum Grade Requirement (Professional Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all students enrolled in the profes sional programs of the College must complete all required courses within the College with a grade of \"C\" or above. Students are encouraged to refer to program- specific policies related to minimum grade require ments which can be found in the College Policy Manual at www.ndsu.edu/healthprofessions/college_information /policy_manual/ . Graduate students are expected to uphold policies and procedures consist ent with the graduate school and to maintain a 3.0 grade point average. Students Enrolled in College A ffiliated Educational Training Pr ograms (Professional Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all students enrolled in College affiliated internships, clinical, or experiential training pr ograms are also required to uphold the academic standards of that affiliate and will be subject to t he terms of probation, susp ension, and termination of the affiliated program. Students failing to meet aff iliated program academic standards may also lead to termination from the College. Conduct Standards High standards of prof essional conduct are expected from all studen ts, both to facilitate the learning of all students and to promote professional values. I ndividuals are expected to represent the College, professional program, or profession in a positive, professional manner. St udents conducting clinical experiences, rotations, and/or internships must also u phold the specific policies of their clinical site. All students are held responsible for exhibiting the follo wing professional attribut es: honesty, integrity, 12 accountability, confidentiality, and professional demeanor. Academic dishonesty and professional misconduct are unacceptable. If there is doubt about whet her or not academic or professional conduct is appropriate, individuals should query the Dean's Office. Examples of unprofessional conduct include, but are not limited to, the following: Academic Misconduct: 1. Cheating, includes but is not limited to, the following: a. The receipt, possession, or use of any material or assistance not authorized by the instructor in the preparation of papers, reports, examinat ions, or any class assignments to be submitted for credit as part of a course or to be submitted to fulfill College requirements. b. Arranging to have others take examinations or complete a ssignments (i.e., papers, reports, laboratory data, or products) for oneself, unauthor ized collaborating with another student on individual assignments, or doing academic work for another student. c. Stealing or otherwise improperly obtaini ng, unauthorized copies of an examination or assignment before or after its administrati on, and/or passing it onto other students. d. Copying, in part or in whol e, exams or assignments that will be kept by the instructor and are handed out in class only for review purposes. e. Knowingly submitting a paper, report, presentati on, examination, or any class assignment that has been altered or corrected, in part or in wh ole, for reevaluation or re-grading, without the instructor's permission. f. Misrepresenting your attendance or the attendance of others in a course or practical experience where credit is given and/or a mand atory attendance policy is in effect. g. Plagiarism: Submitting work that is, in part or in whole, not entirely t he student's own, without attributing such portions to their correct sources. Unauthorized collaboration with another student and representing it as one's own indivi dual work is also considered plagiarism. Ignorance is NOT an excuse. h. Fabrication: falsifying data in scientif ic/clinical research, papers, and reports. i. Aiding or abetting dishonesty: Knowingly givi ng assistance not authorized by the instructor to another in the preparation of papers, reports, presentations, examinations, or laboratory data and products. 2. Utilization of a false/ misleading illness or family emergency to gain extension an d/or exemption on assignments and tests. 3. Violation of any IRB and/or Un iversity research processes. Professional Misconduct 1. Violation of conduct described in course policies or articulated by the instructor in writing. 2. Violation of any code of ethics of the profession in which the student is enrolled. 3.

Entering the classroom or clinical experience habitually late or leaving early, arriving late to a professional activity, without prior permission from the instructor. The instructor also has the obligation to notify the class, if possible in advance, of any changes in class times, possible late arrival, and/or cancelled classes. 5. Approaching faculty, staff, or students in less than a professional manner a nd treating faculty, staff, peers, and patients in a disrespectful and incons iderate way (i.e., addressing a faculty member without the appropriate title during professional activities). Respect and consideration are also expected when addressing a faculty member, staff, student, or patient that chooses to be called by their first name. 6. Failure to deal with professional, staff, and peer me mbers of the health care team in a considerate manner and with a spirit of cooperation. 7. Unprofessional dress (as outlined in the professi onal program, class and/or clinical agency policies) during classes, clinical experiences, or when representing the College of Health Professions. 8. Bringing family members, guests, and pets to t he classroom or any professional academic activities without prior consent of the instructor. 9. Falsifying applications, forms, documents, repo rts, or records of any kind or providing false information to the University personnel prior to adm ission to the College, or while an active member of the College's academic programs. 10. Unauthorized accessing or revealin g of confidential inform ation about faculty, st aff, or students of the College and University. 11. Violation of patient respect and confidentiality in any practice/learning setting. 12.

DUI & DWI (driving under the influence or driving while intoxicated) is considered by the College as improper behavior, and any individual violati ng this law is required to undergo an alcohol/drug evaluation. Reporting Process Academic Misconduct 1. Students are required to report any academic misc onduct to the Senior Associate Dean within 7 days of the occurrence. Failure of the student to report violations within the required time could result in immediate expulsion from the College and/or its programs. Graduate students must also report to the Department C hair of the graduate program. 2. The course instructor who suspects that academic misconduct has occurred in their course or other instructional context has an initial responsibility to: a) inform the student(s) involved of his/her suspicion and the suspicion's grounds; b) allow a fa ir opportunity for the student to respond; and c) make a fair and reasonable judgment as to whether any academic misconduct occurred. 3. The course instructor will report academic misconduct violations to their Department Chair within 7 days of the occurrence or discovery of the misconduct. 4. The Department Chair will report the academ ic misconduct to the Senior Associate Dean . Professional Misconduct 1. Students are required to report any professional misconduct to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development within 7 days of the occurrence. Failure of the student to report violations within the required time could result in immediate expulsion from the College and/or its programs. 2. Faculty members are required to report unprofes sional conduct within the classroom setting. Similarly, other College personnel are required to report professional misconduct issues as they arise and which directly affect their daily professional activities. 3. The faculty member/College personnel will repo rt professional misconduct violations to their Department Chair within 7 days of the occu rrence or discovery of the misconduct. 4. The Department Chair will repo rt the professional misconduct to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development within 7 day s of the discovery of the misconduct. 5. If a faculty member is aware that a student has violated the Conduct Policy outside of the classroom, he/she should remind t he student of the policy and direct the student to self- report any professional misconduct violations to the A ssociate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development within 7 days of the occurrence. Disciplinary Sanctions Academic Misconduct 1. The course instructor is responsible for deter mining the sanction for academic misconduct in the course. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, failure for a particular assignment, test, or course. 2. The course instructor will in form the student of the sanction in writing by completing the Student Academic Misconduct Tracking Form as per Univer sity Policy 335 and submitting it to the student and the Department Chair. 3. The Department Chair will s ubmit a copy of the form to the Senior A ssociate Dean. 4. The Senior Associate Dean will submit the form to the Registrar and Pr ovost/VPAA in accordance with University Policy 335. In the case of gra duate student academic misc onduct, the Dean of the College of Graduate & Interdisciplinary Studies must also receive a copy of the completed Student Academic Misconduct Tracking form. 5. A copy of the Student Academic Mi sconduct Tracking Form will be placed in the student's academic file. Professional Misconduct 14 1. Professional misconduct issues may be more likely to happen outside of the classroom and have broader implications for the well-being of student s, faculty, and staff in the College. Hence, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Facult y Development has the initial and primary responsibility for administering and enforcing professional misconduct issues. 2. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Facult y Development will work collaboratively with the Department Chair (and where appropriate, indivi dual instructors) to resolve professional misconduct issues. Department and College Related Sanctions Additional academic and/or professional disciplinar y sanctions for the department/program may be assigned by the Department Chair depending upon th e circumstances and nature of the misconduct. The Department Administrator will notify the student in writing of the sanction and rights to due process and forward a copy to the Senior Associate Dean &/or the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development. The Senior Associate Dean may impose additional disciplinary sanctions for the College and will notify the student in writing and the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies (if a graduate student involved). Disciplinary action for academic and professional misconduct will depend based upon the seriousness of the misconduct. In general, sanctions may include, but are not limited to, any of the following: 1. Probation. 2. Supervised probation. 3. Suspension from the College. 4. Termination from the College. (Termination from the College of Health Professions does not prohibit the student from registering else where in the University provided the academic standards of the alternate college of registration have been met or exceeded.) In cases of particularly egregious or multiple inst ances of academic/professional misconduct, the Dean of the College may also recommend expulsion from the university. Student's Right to Appeal Students sanctioned for violations of the College Student Academic and Conduct Standards Policy have the right to appeal. Student appeals must follow the appeal procedure outlined below. Graduate student appeals of sanctions involving academic misconduct mu st be filed in accordance with the Graduate Student Appeals policy described in the NDSU Graduate Bulletin. Student Appeals Procedure 1. If the student chooses to appeal a course instructor 's sanction, it must be pursued in the following sequence: course instructor, Department Chair, Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development or Senior Associate Dean, and Dean. 2. Department and College related sanctions for professional misconduct may be appealed to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Facult y Development and the College Student Affairs Committee. Department and College related sanctions for academic misconduct may be appealed to the Senior Associate Dean and the College Academic Affairs Committee. Final appeals may be made to the Dean of the College of Health Professions. 3. In cases of sanctions involving suspension or term ination from the College of Health Professions, the appeal will follow the process outlined in University Policy 335: Code of Academic Responsibility and Conduct. 4. An appeal for any sanction must be made in writing within 15 business days of the sanction letter. The date of the letter shall be the date the letter is post marked. If hand-delivered, a notation of that date will be made in the student's file. 5. Appeal letters must specify in detail one or more of the following bases of appeal: a. the sanction was too severe for the offense; b. the decision for non-action/action/sanction was made in an arbitrary or capricious manner; c. the finding of the Student Academic and Conduct Standards Policy having been violated was not substantiated by evidence, and/or d. the student's/student or ganization's rights were violated (specify those rights believed to have been violated). Appeal Review Process (Pre-professional and Professional Students) 1. Appeals made to the Senior Associate Dean or Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development will be reviewed by the Academic Affairs Committee or Student Affairs Committee of the 15 College depending upon the conduct violation in question. 2. The Academic Affairs/Student Affairs Committee will review the written letter of appeal from the student/organization and the materials from the orig inal adjudication process. After reviewing these materials, the committee may decide to do one of the following: a. issue a decision based solely on the written materials; b. issue a decision based on a review of written ma terials and discussion with the involved principals; c. recall one or more witnesses; d. refer the decision to the full faculty for action; e. return the case for reconsideration of the decision and/or sanctions. 3. The Academic Affairs/Student Affairs Committee ma y uphold or lessen the original decision/sanction but not increase the sanctions/actions imposed by other persons or bodies. 4. The decision of the committee will generally be issued within 15 working days of the receipt of the appeal letter, but may take longer during University recesses, or in the event of complex cases. 5. The Registrar will be advised of the results of the appeal. Unresolved Appeals After the College appeals process has been completed, if the student/organization is not satisfied with the appeal decision, the student/organization has the righ t to appeal the decision to the Provost. The Provost will make the final decision on any appeals. Incomplete Disciplinary Process Students with pending disciplinary or legal actions, with sanctions for which an appeal has been submitted but not resolved, or whose sanctions have not been su ccessfully fulfilled, will not be allowed to graduate from NDSU with a degree, major, or program of study offe red by the College of Health Professions. In such cases, the College reserves the right to place a hol d on a student's graduation until the case has been successfully resolved and the sancti ons have been successfully fulfilled. Annual Pledge, FERPA Notification, and Signature I have read and understand the above policy. I agree to accept and abide by this Student Academic and Conduct Standards Policy of the College of Health Profe ssions. I understand that pos sible violations of this policy and sanctions imposed, as well as information us ed to substantiate violations (including, but not limited to, criminal background checks and drug screens ), may be shared with College affiliated educational training programs, clinical sites at which I may co mplete program-specific experiential requirements, licensing and/or certification boards rele vant to my program of study, clin ical sites at which I work for non- academic reasons (i.e., for pay or to volunteer), and ot her faculty, staff or administrators within the College of Health Professions and North Dakota State University who have a legiti mate interest in my education. I understand that I have the right to revoke the College of Health Professions' ability to share this information at any time. Should I revoke the ability of the College of Health Professions to share relevant information with the aforementioned parties, I al so understand that I am immediately ineligible to complete a degree offered within the College of Health Professions, and I voluntarily (and immediately) withdraw from my major or program of study within the College. I understand t hat withdrawing from a ma jor or program of study within the College of Health Professions does not prev ent me from pursuing another major at North Dakota State University. I am also aware of and assume re sponsibility for following other College and Department policies as stated in my major or program of study's student handbook. RIGHT TO TERMINATE ENROLLMENT POLICY 3.03 The College of Health Professions reserves the right to terminate the enrollment of any student at any time, if the student demonstrates that he or she is unsuited for a professional career and its inherent responsibilities and obligations. Circumstances that ma y lead to student termination will include, but not be limited to, violation of state or federal statutes or regulations. STATUS DOCUMENTATION POLICY 3.06 Upon acceptance to a professional program housed in the College of Health Pr ofessions, students may be required to submit documentation of health stat us. Programs will define their own documentation requirements and include those requirements in their program handbook(s). Examples of documentation may include, but are not limited to: Record of immunizations or other immunity for influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, poliomyelitis, tetanus, diphtheria, hepatit is B Results of tuberculin testing 16 Physical examination by the student's health care provider (MD, DO, NP) within one year Allergies Health problems that may be of significance in clinical practice Permission to release information to clinical agencies Affirmation of veracity of the record Health status documentation to be co mpleted by the student and his/he r health care provider will be provided to the student. Documentation must be submi tted to the student's professional program designee as indicated in student's program handbook. If required by the professional program, tuberculin testing must be done annually and the report submitted to the appropriate department. The expense of the physical examination and any needed immunizations is the student's responsibility. HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY 3.07 Upon admission to the professional program students in the College of H ealth Professions are required to have adequate health insurance coverage in case they requi re health care or hospitalization while they are enrolled. The College does not provide coverage for stude nts while they are in clinical experiences, and students are not covered by the agency's workers' compensation. Insurance company and policy number will be provided by the student to the secretary in th e department in which the student is enrolled before any experience in the clinical areas. Insurance may be obtained through the University or a company selected by the applicant. CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS POLICY 3.08 NDSU (and the College of Health Professions) reserves the right to refuse admission or re-enrollment or to place conditions on admission or re-enrollment of app licants and former students, and suspend or terminate the enrollment of students, who NDSU and/or the Colle ge of Health Professions determine represent a safety risk to NDSU or the College, students, employ ees, property, or affiliated teaching sites and their employees and patients. An individual who is di squalified from having patient contact based on a background check may be unable to meet program require ments and/or to complete their intended degree. The State regulatory boards may deny licensure to an individual with a criminal background. All students will be required to complete a criminal background ch eck as determined by their discipline. Students may be required to obtain two background checks (a multi-st ate and an FBI check) at multiple points in their educational program. Students who do not comply with the background checks, release of information, and the required deadlines for procuring background checks will be prevented from registering for and/or attending classes and/or profes sional program application(s). PROFESSIONAL DRESS POLICY 3.09 Professionalism is a core value of our program. Stu dents are to dress appropriately during the laboratory and experiential components of the pr ofessional program in order to promote and maintain a positive professional image. In addition, appr opriate professional clothing is to be worn when representing the College at professional out-reach activities. Violations of the College or departmental dress code may result in sanctions. Students should refer to their respecti ve department or affiliated clinical/experiential dress code policy for further details. STUDENT TECHNICAL STANDARDS POLICY 3.10 The North Dakota State University College of Health Professions' (NDSU CHP) mission is to educate students and advance research and professional serv ice in pharmacy, nursing, allied sciences, and public health. As a corollary to this mission, the NDSU CHP seeks to train students who have the ability, interest and work ethic necessary to be eligible for licensure and/or certification and to embark upon a successful career as a health care professional. Thus, all pr ofessional programs offered by the NDSU CHP require students to undertake the full set of activities that ar e necessary to complete t heir program(s) of study. The goal of every licensed and/or certified health profes sional is to provide safe and effective care to patients. In order to provide that care, individuals must demonstrate the physical, cognitive and social skills necessary to learn, practice and master each of the competencies of one's profession. Failure to demonstrate these competencies not only endangers t he patients under the provider's care, but also impacts the ability of other health care profession als to provide safe and effective patient care. 17 To that end, the NDSU CHP has established the follo wing technical standards as minimal guidelines regarding the competencies necessary to comple te a professional program in the NDSU CHP. For simplicity, these competencies are organized into thr ee general categories: physical, cognitive and social. Physical Competencies 1. Students must demonstrate sufficient motor skill c apacities to evaluate and execute medication orders, use diagnostic equipment specific to the discipli ne, undertake physical as sessments of patients and effectively deliver therapies commensurate with the discipline. 2. Students must demonstrate suffici ent physical stamina to productivel y contribute to a practice or classroom setting over a standard length of time. As an example, students on clinical rotations should demonstrate the physical stamina to keep up with thei r peers and supervisors as t hey perform patient care activities over the course of a typical shift. 3. Students must demonstrate the physical capacity to observe their surroundings and environment (in both the classroom and in the practice setting) using visual, auditory and somatic senses. Cognitive Competencies 1. Students must demonstrate the innate ability to coll ect, comprehend, and interpret information from their physical surroundings. That is, a st udent must demonstrate not only the phy sical ability to interact with a patient, a peer, a teacher or other environmental stimu li, but must also demonstr ate the cognitive ability to process the interaction and develop an appropriate response. As a practical example, a health care professional must not only demonstra te the physical faculties to communicate with a patient, but also the mental capacity to understand the patient's nee ds and formulate an appropriate response. 2. Students must consistently demonstrate the ability to think analytically and critically. Students must be able to use these skills (both independently and as part of a team of professionals) to solve practical patient care problems. Students must be able to think critically and analytically in an efficient and timely manner, and under stressful conditions. It is important to stress that this competency is as much a function of practice as it is a function of innate cognitive ability (item 1). 3. Students must demonstrate the ability to adapt to new information, situations, problems and environments. Students must demonstra te the ability to incorporate those new stimuli into their decision making processes and respond in an appropriate fash ion. As an example, students must demonstrate the ability to incorporate new concepts, patient care standards and past acad emic and/or work experience into their current and future patient care activities. Social Competencies 1. Students must demonstrate the ability to adhere to the regulatory and institut ional constraints imposed by the discipline, most notably by the law and the licensing board of the discipline in question. 2. Students must demonstrate the ability to act in an ethical and professional manner commensurate with the standards of the discipline. It is important to note that, while laws and regulations are themselves ethical and moral guidelines, they are minimalist in nature. Acting in a truly ethical and professional manner may require holding oneself to stricter standards of behavior than what is r equired by regulatory and institutional constraints. It also requires a high degre e of maturity and emotional stability. 3. Students must demonstrate the ability to observe , understand and show compassion for patients. 4. Students must demonstrate effective interpersonal communication skills, including verbal, nonverbal and written communication skills. Students must demonstrat e sufficient fluency (verbally, nonverbally and written skills) in the native language wh ere the instruction takes place. 5. Students must demonstrate cultural sensitivity, and understand the ideol ogies, socio-cultural and political characteristics which frame the lives and daily activi ties of their peers, co-workers and/or patients. Reasonable Accommodations under the Am ericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) The College strongly encourages any student who suspec ts that he or she may have a disability to contact the NDSU Office of Disability Services for guidance concerning the steps that ar e necessary to document and verify the nature and extent of the disability. Consistent with ND SU, state and Federal policies, students with documented evidence of disabilities have ever y right to request reasonable accommodations of instructors (defined in the broadest sense to include faculty, preceptors, administrators and supervisors), and instructors are required to accommodate reasonabl e requests. However, such requests are not reasonable if they disrupt, are detrimental to and/or endanger patients, student s, co-workers and/or instructors. As such, students w ho, after reasonable accommodations are made, do not consistently demonstrate the competencies identif ied above are ineligible for admission or progression in the NDSU CHP' professional programs. Additional Technical Standards 18 Specific professional programs housed in t he NDSU CHP (and the departments sponsoring those programs) may choose to add additional competencies not specifically identified in this policy. Successful demonstration (with or without reasonable accommodations ) of program specific technical standards is also required for admission and progression within the specific professional program. Students should make every effort to obtain and understand these additional co mpetencies from the academic administrator for that program (i.e., a chair and/or associate dean). Failing to Meet, Reporting and Adjudicating Technical Competencies Students who consistently fail to demonstrate the comp etencies identified above are ineligible for admission or progression in the NDSU CHP' professional progr ams. Students who are admitted to a professional program and who realize (either through their own efforts or as demonstrated by a licensing board, a preceptor or a faculty member in the student's prog ram) that they do not (o r no longer) consistently demonstrate the requisite technical competencies to be eligible for licensure have an ethical obligation to self-report that information to the CHP administration (i.e., the appropriate departm ent chair, the Associate Dean for Nursing, the Senior Associate Dean, and/ or the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development). Moreover, once realized (own awarenes s or as reported to them by a licensing board, faculty, or preceptor), a failure to self-report a co nsistent lack of technical competencies represents a violation of the Student Conduct Policy (College Poli cy Manual, Policy 3.01). Once self-reporting occurs, these administrators will work with the student to identify reasonable accommodations. If reasonable accommodations are not available, th ese administrators will assist the st udent as he or she transitions out of the professional program. This transition will occu r in a manner generally consistent with the timelines established in the Student Conduct Polic y (College Policy Manual, Policy 3.01). SUBSTANCE MISUSE TESTING POLICY 3.14 The NDSU College of Health Professions is committed to ensuring safe, healthy learning environments, including both didactic and experiential learning environment s, for all of its students. The use of illicit drugs, as well as the overt misuse of alcohol and/or legally prescribed medications (including, but not limited to, mood altering medications) compromise learning en vironments and are prohibited under College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy and University Policy 155. It is beneficial for all College of Health Professions stakeholders (including its st udents, faculty, staff, clinical partner s, and the patients and families we serve) to establish a testing policy process to ensure the sa fety and health of these learning environments, as well as to ensure an equitable due process for students w ho are alleged to partake in substance misuse. Bases for Testing The College of Health Professions reserves the ri ght to require any student enrolled in one of its preprofessional or professional programs and/or en rolled in any course housed within the College to undergo testing for substance misuse. All testing is coordinated and monitored through the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Deve lopment (ADSAFD). All testing must be direct observation, 10 panel (or higher) tests, and must be co nducted at a WADA-accredited or SAMHSA-certified laboratory. Per College Policy 3.12: Stu dent File Contents, all test results shall be maintained in a secure location in the Office of the ADSAFD, and may be included in the Student's Personal File. The default method of analysis will be urinalysis, although the ADSAFD reserves the right to require alternative methods of analysis (for example, blood analysis or hair an alysis) where appropriate. Alternative methods (if required) will be disclosed in writing when not ifying the student about the need to be tested. Nonrandom Testing Nonrandom testing for substance misuse may occur as a requirement for entry into clinical sites (per site policies or program-specific experiential education polic ies), or to fulfill the requirements of sanctions imposed under College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy. Reasonable Suspicion Testing Incidents or events involving suspected substance misuse by students shall be reported to the ADSAFD using the Reasonable Suspicion Reporting Form . Reasonable suspicion shall be determined using objective evidence (photos, legal documents, or other documentation), reports made by credible sources (law enforcement, clinical site staff, NDSU faculty and staff, etc.), or a combi nation of thes e sources. Because it is a violation of University Policy 155 and College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy to misuse alcohol or prescription medications, or to use illicit drugs, and testing ma y exonerate the student of an alleged policy violation should the allegation be made falsely, the ADSAFD may exercise discretion in determining what evidence is of sufficient credibility to require testing. A descriptive summary of the evidence will be provided to the student at the time the student is informed of the need to submit to testing. 19 Random Testing The College of Health Professions may implement a random substance misuse testing program. Should a random substance misuse testing program be implement ed, the parameters of the program must be made freely available on the College of Health Profession's website, and students must be provided notice of the policy at least 6 months prior to its implementation. No more than 5 percent of the active College of Health Professions student body may be randomly selected for testing in any academic semester. No student will be randomly identified for testing more than once in a single academic year. The random selection of students will be implemented using a co mputer generated random number gene rating process, with interval (or other non-weighted) sampling. A summary of that selection process shall be provided to the Dean of the College of Health Professions on an annual basis. Testing Process Students who are required to undergo testing will be noti fied in writing via NDSU email. Upon receiving a request for testing, students are responsible for pr oviding a 10 (or larger) panel, direct observation, drug screen from a reputable, appropriated licensed vendor wi thin 12 business hours of the date and time of the request. The student identified for testing is solely responsible for obtaining his/her own appointment for testing, his/her transportation to the appointment, and pay ing the costs of these test s. An original copy of the test results must be delivered to the Office of the ADSAFD at the end of the 12 business hour window. Test results that show evidence of a diluted sample will not be accepted, and will not result in additional time in which to submit test results. Ramifications for Positive Test Results or Failure to Test in a Timely Manner Students whose test results are positive are subject to sanctions outlined in College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy. Once sanctions are assigned, a student's rights of due process are also outlined in College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy. Students who fail to submit an original copy of their te st results within the 12 business hour window face additional sanctions under College Policy 3.01: Stud ent Conduct Policy. More specifically, students who fail to provide the required test results within the 12 business hour window will be sanctioned under the presumption that the test results for the s ubstance misuse in question are positive. Testing Alternatives Students whose religious, cultural or other practices prohibit them from undergoing a specific type of drug test may request that the ADSAFD require an alternative test, so long as the alternative test is of equal or greater accuracy and precision than the original test required by the ADSAFD. All parameters identified previously apply to the alternative test. In the event that no such test exists, or in the event that students are unable to justify the need for an alternative tes t, students may be found in violation of College Policy 3.11: Student Technical Standards SCHOOL OF PHARMACY POLICIES PRE-PHARMACY & PROFESSIONAL PHARMACY MAJORS The faculty reserve the right to change rules and r egulations including those relating to admission, instruction and graduation. Such changes may apply to prospective students, as well as students already enrolled. Changes will be shared with students in a timely manner. However, it is the responsibility of the student to periodically contact their adviser or the Dean's Office to obtain current policies. Please note that additional policies and procedures not contained in this document apply to students in the college. Those policies and proc edures are contained in the College of Health Professions Policy manual. School of Pharmacy Policy Manual WORKLOAD STATEMENT All eligible pharmacy students may use their pharmacy intern licenses as a source of monetary income. The School of Pharmacy strongly encourages every e ligible pharmacy student to meet with her or his academic advisor to determine a number of paid intern hours that allows the student to balance their paid work hours with their educational and other extra-curricular commitments. 20 As a general rule, many (but not all) students find that they may be able to work up to 10-15 hours per week during the typical academic year, and during we eks when no exams are scheduled, and continue to maintain strong grades and meet other commitmen ts. Pre-professional and professional pharmacy students are strongly encouraged to reduce the number of hours worked per week when one or more exams are scheduled. In general, the School of Pharmacy discourages pre- professional and professio nal pharmacy students from working more than 20 hours per week during the academic year. REPETITION OF PRE-PHARMACY CORE COURSES POLICY 2.21.1 The total number of pre-pharmacy core courses which may be repeated shall be limited to three. The grade received during the student's final attempt for any core pre-pharmacy course will be used in evaluation for admission. A withdrawal is not considered an attempt. A core course is one that is included in the GPA for admission purposes. CURRENT COMPETENCY IN COURSEWORK POLICY 2.28 Coursework in the areas of science and mathematics must be no more than seven years old at the time of application to the professional pr ogram. Coursework presented in these areas that is older than seven years must demonstrate current competency. Current competency may be demonstrated by: 1. Retaking a portion of the series in question, i.e. 122 of 121/122 Chem series; 2. Enrolling in a formal audit that is i ndicated on a student's official transcript; 3. Challenging coursework through the department in question; or 4. Meeting with faculty in the areas of Science or Mathematics and having them determine current competency. Students who intend to meet current competency requ irements using item 3 or 4 must receive approval from the Chair of Pharmacy Admissions Committee prior to undertaking the current competency. ACADEMIC REMEDIATION AND REPETITION OF PROFESSIONAL PHARMACY COURSES POLICY 3.20 Professional pharmacy students failing to achieve a minimum grade of \"C\" in a graded course or \"P\" in a pass/fail course may be offered remediation at the discre tion of the course instructor(s). Remediation is a privilege and should only be offered to students with regular course attendance and participation. Remediation is defined as any change in grade based on the established grading criteria and process that applies to all students. Remediation will be tailored to the individual student and may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following in conjunction with academic advising: re-examination, additional coursework, independent study, and campus tutoring. If remediation is offered, it is the responsibility of the instructor to ensure the student demonstrates competence in the course material. Prior to o ffering remediation, the course instructor must notify the Interim Associate Dean for the School of P harmacy with the student's name and proposed plan of remediation. The Interim Associate Dean for the School of Pharmacy will be responsible for tracking remediation opportunities offered to all professional students. Students will only be allowed to remediate one course per semester. If students do not successfully comple te a professional pharmacy course (i.e. grade less than a C), and remediation is not offered, they may repeat the c ourse. Withdrawal (for re asons other than extenuating conditions*) from a professional pharmacy course with a grade less than a C is considered the same as a failure. Failure to complete all Co-Curriculum semester requi rements is considered a professional pharmacy course failure. Students are limited to a total number of three (3) cour se failures and/or course remediation. A fourth occurrence of receiving a grade less than a C (or wi thdrawal due to a grade less than a C) or course 21 remediation in a professional pharmac y course, didactic or experiential, will result in termination from the pharmacy program. For example the established standard would result in dismissal from the professional pharmacy program if a student had the following results: Remediation of 2 courses, failure of 1 course, and failure of 1 APPE. Compliance with the University Clas s Attendance Policy 333 is still requir ed by instructors. Appeals to this policy may be submitted to the Pharmacy Academ ic Affairs and Student Progress Committee which may grant exceptions due to ext enuating circumstances. *All extenuating circumstances must be approved by the Pharmacy Acade mic Affairs and Student Progress Committee before the withdrawal takes place. MINIMUM GRADE REQUIREMENT FOR PHARMACY COURSEWORK POLICY 3.21 A grade of C or better is required in all required courses in the pre-phar macy and professional curricula (courses listed by name or number). The College does not permit any course required wi th name and number to be taken pass/fail, with the exception of labs offered only this way. Course work utilized for NDUS general education credits must be taken for a letter grade. PREREQUISITES FOR PROFESSIONAL COURSES POLICY 3.23 Prerequisites for all courses taught in the professional curriculum are to be established by the faculty and any changes made in prerequisites for the professi onal program must be approved by the faculty. All prerequisite course work in the professional progra m, whether offered from within or without the College of Health Professions, must be completed with a minimum grade of C in order for the student to progress. It is the responsibility of individual course instructor s to check and enforce their own course prerequisites. PROFESSIONAL ELECTIVES POLICY 3.26 A minimum of six professional elective course credit s, that permit exploration of and/or advance study in areas of professional interest, are required for graduation with the entry-level Pharm.D. degree. Professional elective courses are subject to t he following rules. (Note: Students who were admitted before Fall Semester 2017 are required to complete four credits.) 1. Professional elective courses must be taken wh ile enrolled in the entry-level Pharm.D. program (e.g. beginning Fall Semester P1 year). Th ese courses must be completed prior to the beginning of the P4 year. 2. A grade of C or better (or pass for a pass/fail course) is required. 3. The pre-approved professional elective courses are listed below. 4. A student may take a professional elective course that is not included in the pre-approved list only after (1) consultation with his/her academic adv isor, AND (2) approval of the course by the Pharm.D. Curriculum Committee. The necessary steps to take a course that is not included in the pre-approved professional elective course list is as follows: 1. The student must meet with his/her advisor and demonstrate that the course \"permits exploration of and/or advance study in areas of professional interest\". This request must be made to the advisor by December 1 for upcoming spring semester courses, and April 1 for upcoming summer and fall semester courses. 2. If the advisor supports the student's elective c ourse choice, then the advisor shall petition to the chair of the Curriculum Committee to approve the course. 3. The Curriculum Committee will obtai n a syllabus for review and cont act the instructor to address other criteria as needed. 22 4. Upon receipt of all required information, the Curriculum Committee shall review the information, determine the status of the request, and inform the student, and advisor, of the outcome of the petition. 5. If the Curriculum Committee approves the course, the course shall be included in future revisions of the pre-approved professional elective course list.

More specifically, all accredited colleges or schools of pharmacy must establish a comprehensive policy with a simple se t of procedures whereby all students enrolled in the College (and the pharmacy program in particular) can submit and resolve a complaint about the educational process. While such procedures do not always produ ce an outcome that meets t he student's preferences, they do ensure that students have access to an equitable and efficient means to remediate their complaints. The complete set of ACPE standards regarding student complaint policies can be found on pages 38-39 (Standard 20) of the following website: http://www.acpe-accredit.org/ pdf/FinalS2007Guidelines2.0.pdf . The NDSU College of Health Professions takes student comp laints very seriously. Our goal is to ensure that students have access to transparent, due process in a manner that leads to an appropriate resolution of the complaint. To that end, a copy of the NDSU College of Health Professions policy relating to this issue is available on its website at www.ndsu.edu/healthprofessions . Students who have difficulty accessing this webpage may also obtain a copy of t he complaint policy in the Dean's Office (Sudro Hall 123). A discussion of this policy shall take place annua lly during the orientation process for first professional year students. Each student complaint will be appropriately document ed and investigated. A chronological record of each complaint, including the nature of the complaint, writt en records of the complaint procedure and the final outcomes of the resolution process shall be maintained in the Office of the Dean of the School of Pharmacy, and shall be available for review by ACPE or its repres entatives upon written request or in the process of an on-site evaluation visit. Student complaints generally fall within two major cate gories: complaints about unfair grading and all other, non-grade-related complaints. Student complaints about grades are generally handled at the level of the University, since grades are usually administered thr ough the NDSU Office of Registration and Records. Other student complaints remain under the purview of the individual colleges within NDSU. Student Complaints Regarding Grades University Grade Appeal Policy 337 NDSU has an established policy regarding complaints about grading, otherwise known as \"grade appeals\". The full grade appeal policy, which includes hearing procedures, is available at www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/policy/337.pdf . While students actively considering a grade appeal are referred to the aforementioned website for the spec ific details of the policy, a summa ry of the policy is outlined below. With the exception of incomplete grades, a course grade is considered final unless an appropriate appeal is filed by the student. Grade changes are also cons idered only for those students who have not yet earned a degree for which the course in question was applied. For a student who has reason to believe that they ha ve been issued an incorrect or inappropriate grade, he/she must initiate a request for a change of a grade with the instructor within fifteen (15) instructional 24 days of the first day of the semester immediately fo llowing the semester in which the grade was awarded. For Spring Semester courses, the request may be made wi thin fifteen (15) instructio nal days of the start of Fall Semester. A grade appeal is formally initiated when the student pr esents the Grade Appeal Form to the instructor. If there is an unsatisfactory decision, the student mu st consult the Department Head, and the Dean or a designated college committee, proceeding from one level to the next only after an unsatisfactory decision of the conflict at that level. In t he event that the instructor is also the Department Head or Dean, he or she need only be consulted in the capacity of instructor. In the event of an unsatisfactory decision within the college, the student may submit a formal written appea l to the Grade Appeals Board Chair. Such an appeal shall be made within fifteen (15) instructional days a fter conclusion of the college proceedings as stated above. Non-Grade Student Complaints Pre-professional and professional pharmacy student s who have a non-grade-related complaint can seek resolution of that complaint through the following procedur es. It is important to note that these procedures represent the sole avenue for student complaints re garding non-grade-related issues, including (but not limited to) ACPE standards, policies and procedures. Additionally, because the pharmacy program spans multiple departments, the non-grade complaints are handled through the Dean's Office, rather than by the departments themselves. 1. The student(s) or, in cases where student anonymity is required, their advocate (also known as the \"plaintiff(s)\") will file a formal written complaint (d elivered through the postal se rvice or NDSU email) to the Dean's Office in the NDSU College of Health Professions. 2. The written complaint must include a description of the issue, policy, or procedure in question. It must also summarize the argument of the plaintiff (incl uding the grounds for the appeal or complaint) and provide a reasonable amount of ev idence supporting the claim. 3. Upon receipt of the written complaint, the complain t will be assigned to the Senior Associate Dean. The plaintiff(s) will receive email notification (via NDSU em ail) within forty-eight hours of the receipt of the complaint. In the email, the Senior Associate Dean shall acknowledge receipt of the complaint and assign a specific College of Health Profession s committee to review the complaint. The Senior Associate Dean shall also provide a brief rationale fo r assigning the complaint to a particular committee. The determination of the appropriate committee to re view the case rests solely with the Senior Associate Dean. Plaintiff may not appeal the committ ee assignment, so long as the rationale for the assignment is provided by t he Senior Associate Dean. 4. The Senior Associate Dean shall convene a meeti ng of the College Academic Affairs (if the complaint is primarily \"academic\" in nature, as defined by College Policy 3.01) or the Student Affairs Committee (if the complaint is \"non-academic\" in nature, as defined by College Policy 3.01) to review the complaint. The Committee meeting shall occur within thirty days from the time that the Senior Associate Dean receives the written complaint. 5. Once the Committee has met, the Senior Associat e Dean shall prepare and submit a formal, written reply to the student(s) based on the recommendati on of Committee. The reply shall include an evaluation of the complaint, a description of any vi olations, and a proposal for any necessary corrective action. The reply will be sent through official NDSU delivery methods (i.e., the postal service, campus mail and/or the NDSU email system) within fifteen business days from the time that the Committee makes a decision. 6. Decisions of the Committee t hat demonstrate arbitrary and capricious treatment, or that are fundamentally inappropriate in the eyes of the plaintiff(s) may be appealed to the Dean of NDSU College of Health Professions. In such cases, t he student(s) file an appeal using steps one through three outlined above, except the wr itten complaint would be addressed di rectly to the Dean. The written complaint would also identify and provide evidence i ndicating that the Senior Associate Dean and/or the Committee acted in an arbitrary, capric ious or otherwise inappropriate manner. 7. If unsatisfactory resolution occurs after the appeal to the Dean, a final appeal may be made to the Provost. Once again, the student(s) must file an appeal using steps one through three outlined above, except the written complaint would be addressed di rectly to the Provost, rather than the Dean, and would provide evidence substantiating the claim of unfair treatment at prior procedural levels. 25 STUDENT TECHNICAL STANDARDS (PHARM.D) POLICY 3.29 The North Dakota State University College of Health Professions' mission is to educate students and advance research and professional service in phar macy, nursing, allied sciences, and public health. As a corollary to this mission, the Doctor of Pharmacy (P harm.D.) program seeks to train students who have the ability, interest and work ethic necessary to be eligible for licensure, and embark upon a successful career as a healthcare professional. Thus, the Pharm.D. pr ofessional program requires students to undertake the full set of activities that are necessary to complete their program of study. The goal of every licensed phar macist is to provide safe and effective care to patients. In order to provide that care, individuals must have the physical, cognitiv e and social skills necessary to learn, practice and master each of the competencies of one's profession. Failure to demonstrate these competencies not only endangers the patients under the pharmacist's care, but al so impacts the ability of ot her providers to provide safe and effective patient care. Therefore, the following technical standards represent competencies ne cessary to complete the Pharm.D. professional program and provide additional guidance to the College Student Technical Standards Policy 3.11 for students. Students must be able, with or wi thout reasonable accommodations, to consistently demonstrate these competencies. Students who fail to demonstrate these competencies are ineligible for admission or progression in the NDS U Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) professional program. The technical standard competencies are organized into five general categories: 1. Perception/observation 2. Communication 3. Motor/tactile function 4. Intellectual, conceptual, int egrative, and quantitative abilities 5. Behavioral and Social Attributes 1. Perception/Observation Competencies Students must be able to utilize their senses and mental abilities to perceive and observe information presented through: Written material Audiovisual material Demonstration Large-group lectures Small group discussions and presentations One-on-one interactions Laboratory experiences Patient encounters (at a distance or close at hand) Procedures 2. Communication Competencies Students must be able to communicate effectivel y and efficiently (in English) using nonverbal, verbal, and writing strategies with faculty me mbers, other members of the healthcare team, patients, families, and other students, in order to: Produce written and oral communication Elicit information Convey information Clarify information Create rapport Work collaboratively Develop therapeutic relationships Demonstrate computer literacy 3. Motor/Tactile Function Competencies Students must have sufficient motor function, skills, and tactile ability to execute basic tasks in the training and provision of patient care. Th is includes coordinati on of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision in order to: Attend and participate in classes, groups, and ac tivities which are part of the curriculum. Conduct basic laboratory procedures and tests. Perform basic, non-sterile compounding. Demonstrate aseptic technique. 26 Examine patients (including inspection, auscu ltation, palpation, percussion, and other diagnostic cardiopu lmonary resuscitation, perform palpitation, auscultation, and percussion. Provide patient care appropriate to the circumstances. Perform in a reasonably independent way in potentially high speed/ high demand/emergency environments. 4. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative & Quantitative Competencies: Student must be able to demonstrate higher-lev el cognitive abilities, which include: Memory Rational thought Visual-spatial comprehension Conceptualization Application Measurement Calculation Analysis Representation (oral, written, diagrammatic, three dimensional) Organization Synthesis Clinical reasoning Ethical reasoning 5. Behavioral and Social Competencies Students must consistently demonstrate attr ibutes of professionalism, including: Empathy, compassion, integrity, and respect for others. Preparation, initiative, and accountability consis tent with a commitment to excellence. Commitment to legal and ethical principles pertain ing to the provision of patient centered care. Mindfulness of the environment, recognizing t hat one's professionalism is constantly evaluated by others. Reasonable Accommodations under the Am ericans with Disa bilities Act (ADA) The College strongly encourages any student who suspec ts that he or she may have a disability to contact the NDSU Office of Disability Services for guidance concerning the steps that ar e necessary to document and verify the nature and extent of the disability. Co nsistent with NDSU and Federal policies, students with documented evidence of disabilities may request r easonable accommodations. However, such requests are not reasonable if they disrupt, are detrimental to and/or endanger patients, st udents, co-workers and/or instructors, or otherwise cause a fundamental alteration to the program. Failing to Meet, Reporting and Adjudicating Technical Competencies Applicants and students of the P harmacy Doctorate profes sional program who consistently fail to demonstrate the competencies identified above are ine ligible for admission or progression in the program. Students who are admitted to the Pharmacy Doctorate professional program and who realize (either through their own efforts or as demonstrated by a lice nsing board, a preceptor or a faculty member in the program) that they do not (or no longer) consistently demonstrate the requisite technical competencies to be eligible for licensure have an ethical obligation to self-report that information to the College's administration (i.e., the appropriate department chair and/or the Senior Associate Dean). Once realized (through own awareness or as reported to them by a lice nsing board, faculty, or preceptor), failure to self- report a consistent lack of technical competencies represents a violation of the Student Conduct Policy (College Policy Manual, Policy 3.01). EXAMINATION ADMINISTRATION POLICY 3.30 The purpose of this policy is to provide expectations for student conduct related to examinations and ensure examinations given at the School of Pharmacy are adequately and consistently administered. Aside from maintaining academic integrity, examination procedure s prepare the student for the stringent expectations of the professional licensure process. Technology Requirements 1. Students must possess an iPad and accessories that meet the School of Pharmacy requirements. 27 2. Students must install and maintain a current versi on of the electronic testing software utilized for ExamSoft exam delivery on any devic e that will be used during an exam. 3. Students should be familiar with their iPad, testi ng software, and instructions prior to downloading an examination. 4. Students are expected to: a. Have an A/C power cord available AND a fully charged battery (at least 2 hours) for cases in which there is a power disruption during the examination OR an electrical outlet is not near the student's assigned seat. b. Ensure that the internal clock is se t to the correct date and time (CST/CDT). Timing and Attendance at Examinations 1. Students requiring accommodations are to coordinate wi th the office of Disability Services prior to the delivery of the examination (N DSU Policy Manual Section 606). 2. Students are expected to be present for all exami nations unless otherwise stated by the course instructor. All absences require appropriate docu mentation and instructor approval (NDSU Policy Manual Section 333). a. Students missing an examination due to an EXCUSED absence will be permitted to take a make-up examination timed at t he discretion of the instructor. b. Students missing an examination due to an UNEXCUSED absence may be granted the privilege of taking a make-up examination; how ever, the student will be subject to a penalty on their exam score. c. In any case where a delayed or makeup ex amination is necessary, a comparable but different examination may be given. Faculty may assess in a different format from the original exam (e.g. multiple choice may be replaced with essay questions). 3. Students must be on time for examinations. Students arriving more than 15 minutes late, without proper justification, will be subject to penalty. St udents arriving late must take the examination in a location determined by the individual administer ing the exam. Unless extenuating circumstances are cause for the delay and were unavoidabl e, they will receive no additional time. 4. Examination start times will not be delayed due to a hardware or software problem with a student's iPad. Students encountering a technical issue du ring an exam should notify the individual administering the exam. See Technology Issues . 5. Students are responsible for bringing their iPad to t he examination room with the exam file already downloaded. Additional time will not be granted for downloading exam files when it was available prior to the exam session. Examination Procedures 1. Faculty are responsible for being attentive to students during an exam. 2. Students may be asked for identification or sign an attendance log at any time. 3. Students are expected to maintain a decorum an d demeanor consistent with accepted academic and professional standards at all times during examinations (NDSU CHP Policy Manual Section 3.9). Lack of professional decorum may result in dismissal from the exam, which will be considered an unexcused absence. 4. Students may be randomly s eated during an examination. 5. An examination may take place during a time that is not part of their regular course schedule. This will be determined by the faculty and will be conveyed in the course syllabus. 6. Students are allowed ONLY the following items at their seat: a. IPad devoid of taped-on notes or markings that could be construed as \"cheat sheets\" b. Power adapter c. Standard (non-mechanical/non-refillable) #2 pencils d. The following items may be allowed if deemed necessary by the course instructor: 1) Scratch paper if allowed would be provi ded by the faculty member as colored paper and must be turned in and signed at the end of the exam 2) Non-programmable calculator 3) iPad stylus 7. Students must leave ALL personal it ems in student lockers or place at the front of the testing room if a lockers is unavailable. Restricted items includes, but is not limited to: a. Food and drinks b. Books, notes, study aids, etc. (unless specifically permitted by the instructor) c. Mechanical/refillable pencils/pens/pencil cases d.

One's body should be void of writing in reference to exam content. All items are subject to inspection. 9. Proctors may confiscate restricted items until the exam is completed. Posses sion of restricted items will be considered a lack of proper decorum and be subject to penalty. Serious breaches (e.g. cheat sheet) will result in dismissal from the examination. 10. If the instructor decides to addres s a student inquiry related to inte rpretation or context of the exam they shall address the answer to the entire class. Questions ma y only be addressed before the first student completes the examination. 11. Students witnessing suspected cheating should notify the procto r discreetly and immediately. 12. Students will not be excused from the exam room without good re ason. Those granted permission, should turn over all papers or enable the \"Hi de Exam\" function so it cannot be viewed by a classmate. No more than one student will be allowe d to leave the examination room at one time. During absence, students should not use any co mmunication device or consult any reference. 13. Students must turn in all requested materials (e.g. exam, answer sheet, scratch paper, equation sheets) prior to exiting the examination room. 14. When completing the exam, students must su bmit and have a receipt of their uploaded exam confirmed by the individual delivering the ex am before leaving the exam room. Students who experience difficulty submitting their exam will be referred for te chnical assistance. 15. After submitting the exam, a student must leav e the examination room and any adjacent area to prevent disturbing those students still taking the examination. Technology Issues 1. If a student is unable to download the examination f ile or there is an iPad failure after downloading the examination file but prior to the examination start time, the student should contact the course instructor PRIOR to the examination start time. 2. If an iPad freezes or fails during an examination: a. Bring the device to the proc tor at the front of the room. b. Restart the device (instructor will not e the amount of time needed for restart). c. If unable to restart and resume the examinati on, leave the device at the front of the room and obtain a paper copy of the examination. Academic Dishonesty 1. Students are expected to adhere to the Student Academic and Co nduct Standards Policy (NDSU CHP Policy Manual Section 3.01). 2. Students should avoid behaviors that give the appearance of cheating (e.g. talking during exams, wandering eyes) and should take measures to protect their own work. 3. Violations of the Conduct St andards will be reported to the Interim Associate Dean for the School of Pharmacy and reported via the Prof essional Misconduct tracking form 4. Instructors may move students during the examination to avoid or suspend possible instances of cheating. If a widespread breach of the Conduct St andards is suspected, particularly in the case of emergency matters/evacuation, t he instructor may cancel the re mainder of the examination and reschedule a new exam at a later date (NDSU Policy Manual Section 335). Interruptions During an Examination 1. If a fire alarm or other emergency condition o ccurs during an examination, either paper or electronic-based, students will immediately cease taking the exami nation and evacuate the building. All materials should be turned over and left on the desk. 2. Students may be asked to evacuate to a specific lo cation. Students are to remain in full view of the individual administering the exam where they can hear the all clear announcement. 3. Students may not discuss the examination with any other person or access any materials including electronic devices. 4. After the fire alarm or other cause of interruption has ended, students will return to their assigned seat immediately and if possible, resume the examination when announced by the proctor to do so. Students returning later than 10 minutes followi ng the \"all clear\" signal may be excluded from continuing the examination. 29 5. The examination will add additional time equal to t hat lost during the interruption, if time permits. Students returning late will not receive additi onal time above that given to all students. 6. In the event of a prolonged interruption of 15 mi n without a foreseeable resolution, the examination should be cancelled and rescheduled for a different date Penalties 1. Instructors are encouraged to outline penalties for examination infractions within their course syllabus. An example of infractions and associated penalties are listed in Table 1 . 2. All infractions, regardless of penalties should be reported by the instructor through the Professional Misconduct Tracking Form within seven days of occurrence. Table 1 . More than 15 minutes late to a scheduled examination 10% deduction from student's earned exam score Faculty has some concer n regarding possibility of academic misconduct (example: student has a watch, cell phone, etc. available during the examination 15% deduction from student's earned exam score Student has an unexcused absence during the examination 30% deduction from student's earned exam score There is a high likelihood or evidence of academic dishonesty (2-way communication, written resource, cheat sheet, evidence of cheatin g from ExamSoft data anal ysis) Exam score of 0% and reported to the Interim Associate Dean for the School of Pharmacy CERTIFICATION Pharmacy students must obtain and maintain certif ication for American Heart Association (AHA) Basic Life Support (BLS) for Healthcare Providers. Each st udent is responsible for securing certification and for submitting verification of certification to the pharmacy practice department office (Sudro 118A) during the first professional year of the program and upon r enewal while enrolled in the pharmacy program. The department of pharmacy practice office will provid e students with additional information regarding CPR certification and renewal during the first and third professional years. HEALTH VACCINES/EXPOSURE TO BIOHAZARD During portions of the training pr ogram for Pharm.D. student s, a student may be exposed to blood and body fluids of patients. Along with this exposure is the risk of Hepatitis B infection. Documentation of the completed Hepatitis B vaccination series or a signed wa iver is required prior to participation in experiential education. The full vaccination against Hepatitis B requi res a six-month series of three shots. You can obtain the Hepatitis B vaccine from your healthcare provider, or from the NDS U Student Wellness Center. If you choose to receive your immunizations at t he Student Wellness Center, appointments are required. Testing is required for TB (tuberculosis) annually fo r students in the Pharm.D. program. Pharm.D. students are required to complete a two-step tuberculosis scre ening during their first pr ofessional year, a one-step tuberculosis screening during their second professional year and a final two-step tuberculosis screening at the end of their third professional year. Pharm.D. students may also be required to complete additional tuberculosis screenings and/or immunizations as required by the practice sites. All students are required to provide a copy of their immunization records and relevant titers before beginning coursework in the Pharm.D. program. Request copies of your childhood/adolescent immunizations and any immunizations you have received as an adult, and titers from your healthcare provider(s). These records must be from a healthcare provider. Examples of th is would be from Student Health, clinic records, myChart documentation, or State Certificat e of Immunization record. We cannot accept records from high schools or wallet type cards that have been kept by family members. Students may contact the Experientia l Office at (701) 231-5576 after June 5 with any questions regarding these records. Please note: We cannot discuss your m edical records with any other individuals, including parents or family members. 30 Students must retain and maintain the original copi es of these records throughout their progression in the pharmacy program. You should begin to collect this information as soon as possible in order to ensure that you meet program requirements. When you have received all of these records from your healthcare provider(s), submit a photocopy of these records you received as your documentation (see specific requirements listed below) for the Pharm.D. program to Liz Frannea by July 13. Documentation must clearly identify the health care facility from which the records were obtained . Experiential Education sites require students to provide proof of immunity prior to completing Introductory and Advanced Phar macy Practice Experiences.

In particular, the need for assessment flexibility during extraordinary time s such as the COVID pandemic. In preparation for the possibility of the continued need for testing remo tely, the NDSU School of Pharmacy is asking for students to have access to a laptop computer (either a PC or Mac) for the upcoming year and beyond. Access to an iPad is no longer a requirement for t he PharmD program. During the 2020-2021 academic year only, the iPad may still be used for exams only when given in a traditional classroom setting with a live proctor. Unlike the iPad, a laptop computer will provide the capability to deliver proctored remote examinations, expand functionality of Blackboard for teaching and learning, increase connectivity to classroom technology (AG Hill Center, etc.), and the possibility to remotely administer standardized exams such as the PCOA, Pre-NAPLEX, and Pre-MPJE. In the event that course instruction and testing require online delivery, students must have access to a laptop, Wi-Fi connection, and a quiet testing environm ent. The computer must not be a desktop or tablet (e.g. Apple (iPad), Windows, Android, Chrome or Linux operating system -based tablets are not permitted).

Differential tuition is needed to cover the higher costs associated with a professional degree program. This differential tuition does not include other student fees, room and boards, and misc ellaneous expenses. As noted earlier, students are expected to complete certain degree requirements incl uding Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience (IPPE) and Advanced Pharmacy Practi ce Experience (APPE) during summer months in addition to the regular academic year. Starting with the fall 2013 seme ster, students should expe ct to be charged (and to pay) differential tuition on course credits for all prof essional program degree requirements regardless of the term in which credits are earned. The amount of diff erential tuition in an academic term can be found on the NDSU Financial Aid and Scholarships website: www.ndsu.edu/onestop/accounts/ . There is a non- refundable admission deposit fee of $500 for students who have been accepted to the pharmacy program. This fee is to assure their place in the class and will be applied to the differential tuition for the first semester of the professional program. 33 NDSU ENTRY-LEVEL PHARM.

To enter the pre-pharmacy program the student must qualify for and obtain admission to the University. Applications to NDSU may be obtained from the NDSU Office of Admission. Admission to the professional pharmacy program is competitive and limited to 85 students each year. Students are selected based upon successful prior academic performance at the time of admission. There are two paths to gain admission into the pharmacy program. Early Admission Pathway (EAP) to the Professional Entry-Level Pharm.D. Program The first is our \"early admission\" path. This path is designed for high achieving high school students who seek an expedited path to the professional program. Students are selected for this path based on their academic credentials (including high school grade point averages and ACT or SAT scores) at the time they apply to NDSU. Preference is given to North Dakota residents. Supplemental applications are submitted online directly to the Pharmacy Admissions Co mmittee. A nonrefundable $125.00 application fee must accompany the supplemental applicat ion. Students are evaluated during the summer before they enroll at NDSU as first year students, and will be offered admissi on to this path on or before May 15 of that year. Once accepted on this admission path, students must a ttend NDSU for the entire six-year program. The first year entails standard pre-profes sional studies. At the conclusion of the first year, students who maintain academic and professional requirements transiti on into a five-year professional program. Differential tuition is assessed for the final five years of the professional program (i.e., the second year of the EAP program and all subsequent years). During the first year in t he professional program, students complete all remaining pre-professional requirements, including an expedited set of courses that prepare them for the final four years of the professional program. Students al so complete the Pharmacy College Admissions Test (PCAT) and an on-site interview. Trans ition into the final four years of the professional program is guaranteed as long as students meet a ll academic and professional requirements. Students accepted into the \"early admissions\" path, but who fail to meet all academic and professional requirements, are encour aged to apply to the professional program through the second path described below. Traditional Admission Pathway to the Professional Entry-Level Pharm.D. Program The second path is our \"traditional\" path. Pre-pharma cy students (including transfer students) typically apply for admission to the four-year professional program during the second (or in some cases the third) pre- pharmacy year. Admission to the professional pha rmacy program is competitive and limited to the difference between the number of available seats (8 5) and the number of \"early admission\" students entering the final four years of the professional program each y ear. Students are selected based upon successful pre-pharmacy academic performance. Preference is gi ven to North Dakota residents and students who attend NDSU. A cumulative grade point av erage of 3.0 (4.0 = A) or above is required before an applicant will be evaluated for admission to the prof essional program. The actual admission cutoff is much higher. The Pharmacy College Admission Test (P CAT) is an admission requirement. Students must take the PCAT during the July or September testing dat es. An on-site interview is part of the admission process for the professional program. Supplemental applications are due on or before December 31 for subsequent fall semester admission. Supplemental app lications are submitted online directly to the Pharmacy Admissions Committee. A nonrefundable $125.00 application fee must accompany the supplemental application. Applicants should note that adm ission to the University does not grant admission to the Entry Level Pharm.D. Program. All students must apply and be formally accepted by the Pharmacy Admission Committee of the School of Pharmacy before they may begin the professional courses in the four years of the pharmacy program. Students may apply to the School of Pharmacy for admi ssion into the Professional Pharmacy program upon satisfactory completion of the pre- pharmacy program or evi dence that this program will be successfully completed at either NDSU or another accredited college prior to admission. Students not previously enrolled at NDSU must apply both to NDSU (with a NDSU Application for Admission) and to the School of Pharmacy (with the Supplemental Pharmacy Application form). 36 Applications will be reviewed by t he Pharmacy Admission Commi ttee, which is composed of administrators, pharmacy practitioners, and pharmacy faculty in the basi c, administrative and clinical sciences. The size of each entering professional class is limited by the availability of the resources of the School of Pharmacy and the capacity of the clinical facilities. NDSU is a state supported institution, thus, residents of North Dakota will be given primary consideration. Residen ts from other states who attend NDSU full time will also be given partial residency preference. A cumulative grade point average of 3.0 (4.0=A) or above is required before an applicant will be evaluated for admiss ion to the Professional Entry Level Pharm.D. Program. The actual admission \"cut off\" is generally much higher than a 3.0. Application Procedures 1. APPLICATION MATERIALS are available on P harmCAS and should be submitted by November 2 nd. The student is responsible for seeing that A LL application materials are submitted and received by November 2nd. Applications with materials missi ng will not be considered for admission. Applications received after November 2nd may not be evaluated. Applications submitted after November 2nd will be used to fill remaining spots in the professional program if any are available after evaluating those applications s ubmitted prior to the November 2nd deadline. 2. APPLICATION FEE - All PharmCAS fees must be paid before your applicat ion will be processed. A non-refundable $125 application fee may be required for admission for non-EAP applicants. 3. If the applicant is not a current or former NDS U student, a separate application must be made for admission to NDSU through the NDSU Office of Admission. 4. Official transcripts from all universities and colleges attended must be sent to the NDSU Office of Admission AND to the College of Health Professi ons. The transcripts must contain the winter quarter or fall semester grades. Students must show transcript evidence that all coursework required by the end of the spring term (courses listed by name and number) will be completed by the end of spring term. The applicant must also supply official transcripts of spring term. It is the responsibility of the applicant to determine that all transcripts and other application materials (supplemental applications and completed PCAT scores) are submitted and updated if incomplete transcripts are initially submitted. a. Note: NDSU students not enrolled in the pre-pharmacy major must contact the Office of Registration & Records to request their transcripts be forwarded to the School of Pharmacy. 5. The Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT) is required. Completed scores must be sent to the Chair of the Pharmacy Admiss ion Committee. For information on the PCAT, contact us at 701- 231-7601. The School of Pharmacy requires that students take the PCAT in July, September, or October 2020 as their most recent exam. We will accept PCAT sco res back three years (July 2017 to October 2020). The web address for the PCAT is www.pcatweb.info . 6. All courses must be completed with at least a gra de of \"C.\" Selected core courses, indicated by an asterisk (*) must be completed by the end of fall semester prior to the November 2nd deadline date to apply to the pharmacy program. Remaining co urses, which are required and listed in the pre- pharmacy curriculum, MUST be completed by the end of spring term. The only exceptions are the electives which may be completed during the summer (up to six credits). 7. An interview on campus is part of the eval uation process for students who receive final consideration for admission. Notification of Acceptance 1. Applicants are notified of their acceptance as rapidly as admission decisions are made. 2. Acceptance Deposit: Applicants who are offere d a position into the entry-level Professional Pharm.D. program are required to submit a non-refu ndable deposit fee of $500.00 to the School of Pharmacy to assure a place in the class. This dep osit is typically due within 30 days of receipt of an admission letter. This fee will be applied to the differential tuition for the first semester of the professional program. 3. Differential Tuition. In 2012 the North Dakota Board of Higher Education approved a differential tuition for the pharmacy professional program whic h is higher than the standa rd university tuition rate. Differential tuition is needed to cover the higher costs associated with a professional degree program. This differential tuition does not in clude other student fees, room and boards, and miscellaneous expenses. As noted earlier, students are expected to complete certain degree requirements including Introdu ctory Pharmacy Practice Ex perience (IPPE) and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience ( APPE) during summer months in addi tion to the regular academic 37 year. Starting with the fall 2013 semester, students should expect to be charged (and to pay) differential tuition on course credits for all prof essional program degree requirements regardless of the term in which credits are earned. The amount of differential tuition in an academic term can be found on the NDSU Financial Aid and Scholarships website: www.ndsu.edu/onestop/accounts/. For Early Admission Pathway (EAP) students, differential tuition is assessed starting in the second undergraduate year of study, and is assessed thereafter (i.e., the final five years of study). For Traditional Pathway students, differential tuition is assessed once students are accepted into the first professional year (i.e., P1) of the Doctor of Pharmacy program. 4. An additional $100 fee is required. It will be applied to the first-year annual fee for registration as a Pharmacy Student Intern in North Dakota, with the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy. Note: this $100 annual fee for licensure as a student intern is required by the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy for four years of enrollment in the professional program. Once a student is accepted into the professional pharmacy program, he or she is expect ed to continuously hold a valid North Dakota Pharmacy Intern license for the entir ety of their professional program. Reapplication A student who has made application to the professional program but is not accepted, who fails to enroll after being accepted or who was unsuccessful in the Early Admissions Pa thway program (EAP), may reapply for admission to the professional program. Students are allowed to apply to the program twice (including the EAP). Regardless of wh ether or not a student meets the eligibility requirements, once a student pays the pharmacy application fee, that application officially counts toward the limit of two attempts. All academic and admission requirements in force at the time of his/her reapplication must be met. PLEASE NOTE The faculty reserve the right to change rules and r egulations including those relating to admission, instruction and graduation. Such changes may apply to prospective students, as well as students already enrolled. Changes will be shared with students in a timely manner. However, it is the responsibility of the student to periodically contact their adviser or the Dean's Office to obtain current policies. For further information, forward inquiries to the Chair of the Pharmacy Admission Committee, School of Pharmacy, College of Health Profession s, North Dakota State University, Dept. 2650, PO Box 6050, Fargo, ND 58108. 38 PHARM.D. EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES This document defines the educational outcomes, or what stud ents will be able to do upon completion of the Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum at North Dakota State University School of Pharmacy.

Students are expected to make sufficient financial and other preparations in advance of these experiences to allow t hem to successfully complete the experiential requirements. Students are responsible for housing, board, travel expenses and all other related expenses during these experiences. Pharmacy students must register annually as a Student Intern with the North Dakota State Board of Pharmacy and must continuously hold valid licensure as a pharmacy inte rn in North Dakota for the duration of the professional program. Students must pay all ND Board internship fees to be eligible for the experiential education program. Students with experiential placement in st ates outside of North Dakota must al so register and pay for an intern license in those states. INTRODUCTORY AND ADVANCED PHARMACY PRACTICE EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION Introductory Pharmacy Practi ce Experience (IPPE) consists of a total of 300 hours throughout the P1 - P2 - P3 years. First year professional students will complete 120 hou rs of IPPE in an institutional pharmacy setting during the summer between their P1 and P2 y ear. Second year professi onal students will complete 160 hours of IPPE in a community pharmacy setting during the summer between their P2 and P3 year. The remaining required 20 hours consists of actual and simulated patient care experien ces dispersed throughout the P1, P2, and P3 curriculum. Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experi ence (APPE) is comprised of 8 five -week rotations during the fourth professional year. Five of the eight rotations are requi red rotations including; ambulatory care, acute care, institutional, community advanced, and rural health. The re maining three rotations are considered elective rotations and are chosen based on student perso nal and professional preferences. PHARMACY REGULATIONS FOR EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION North Dakota A student enrolled in the entry-level Pharm.D. program is required to register as a PHARMACY INTERN per North Dakota Administrative Code prior to the fall term of the fi rst professional year. Registration is conducted at a time specified by the Board of Pharmacy in cooperation with t he College of Health Professions. Students enrolled in the professional pharmacy curriculum are assessed $100 per y ear by the Board of Pharmacy for a maximum of four years. Pharmacy students must regi ster annually as a Student Intern with the North Dakota State Board of Pharmacy and must continuously hold valid licensure as a pharmacy intern in North Dakota for the duration of the professional program. The Pharm.D. degree provides a student 1600 hours of Ad vanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) toward North Dakota licensure. Experiential requirements within th is program grant a student eligibility for North Dakota licensure examinations as a pharmacist immediately upon gr aduation. Although all eligibility requirements for North Dakota licensure are satisfied through hours received fr om the experiential program, students are encouraged to seek additional hours of internship expe rience by working during their free summ er periods to enhance their learning throughout the professional program. The North Dakota Pharmacy Practice Act allows a student to register as an intern with the Board of Pharmacy prior to beginning Pharm.D. coursework as long as the student has completed a year of college and is registered in the pre-pharmacy program. For more information concerning this and other internship program details, contact the Board Office as listed below.

Cody Wiberg, Pharm.D., Executive Director Minnesota State Board of Pharmacy 2829 SE University Ave., Suite 530 Minneapolis GRADUATE RESIDENCY FAQS What is a Pharmacy Residency? A pharmacy residency is an organized, mentored, post-graduate training program. Typically, a residency is completed directly after graduating from a Doctor of Phar macy program. However, some may choose to complete residency after practicing as a lic ensed pharmacist for a few years. What will I learn in a residency program? You will learn the knowledge and gain the experience required of pharmacists in various areas of practice. You will have the opportunity to learn from pharmacist s who are experts in their area of pharmacy. Why should I do a residency? This is an opportunity to bridge the gap between being a pharmacy student one day, and the next day being a licensed pharmacist. You will have the opportunity to fortif y your strengths, strengt hen your weaknesses, and develop confidence in your abilities as an individual pharmacist. Other benef its include a competitive advantage in the job market, networking opportunities, career planni ng, and attendance/participation at local and national meetings. What is the duration of residency program? Each residency is typically one year. They start July 1 and conclude June 30 each year. Some residencies are offered in combination with a postgraduate degree (M .S., MBA), and may take additional years to complete. Are all residency programs the same? No. The type of residency you select will depend on your ca reer objectives. Select a pr ogram that will prepare you for the type of job you eventually want to have. Examples of current residency types include: PGY-1 (\"Pharmacy Pr actice\" or \"General\") Pediatrics Psychiatry Ambulatory Care Infectious Diseases Oncology Pharmacy Management Managed Care Critical Care Are residencies only for hospital-based programs? No. There are many ambulatory based programs. In fa ct, these programs are among the fastest growing type. Do I get paid during this program? Yes. Most residencies pay roughly $40,000-$45,000 for the year. Some programs allow the opportunity to pick-up extra pharmacist shifts to earn extra pay. Most program s offer fringe benefits (e.g. health care, investment opportunities, etc.). Also, you may be eligible for deferri ng payment on your student loans during the program. I'm not sure what type of program is right for me. What do you suggest? The most common type of residency is a PGY-1 (\"Pharmacy Practice\" or \"General\") residency. It covers a broad spectrum of practice areas and patient types. Required experiences include acute care, ambulatory care, drug information, and practice management. In addition to thes e \"core\" elements, each program has various specialty areas to complete the training experience. Also, a research project (in collaboration with one of your preceptors) is completed during the residency year. Some programs include teaching/precepting opportunities in cooperation with an affiliated college of pharmacy. Finally, programs have va rious service (\"staffing\") requirements. Typically, staffing requires functioning as a pharmacist dur ing evening and/or weekend hours. How do I apply for a residency program? PGY-1 and PGY-2 residencies (ASHP-accredited) require part icipation in the residency-matching program. This is a formal process that attempts to match applicants to t heir choice of programs and vice versa. Programs that are in the process of receiving accreditation may also partici pate in the residency-matching program. Check with the individual programs to verify their accreditation, and match participation status. 60 To participate in the Match for a position designated as a PGY-2 residency, an applicant must have already completed a PGY-1 residency, or currently be in traini ng in a PGY-1 residency prog ram that will be completed before the start of the PGY-2 residency. Current PGY-1 residents who are interested in continuing t heir training in a PGY-2 residency offered by the same sponsor as the applicant's PGY-1 residency (e.g., the same or an affiliated organization) may be able to obtain the position through an Early Commitment Process. Applican ts who are committed to a position in this manner do not need to register for or participate in the Match. After I complete this residency experience, what is next? You will have an advantage over many of your peers regarding employment opportunities. More \"doors\" will be open to you, and you will have more freedom in your ca reer choice. Many employers value residency-trained pharmacists, and some jobs require re sidency experience. Graduates of resi dency programs go on to the following: pharmacist positions (staff, specialist, manager, etc.) in thei r area of training, faculty positions, specialty residency programs, or fellowship programs. How do I find out more about residency programs and where they are located? Here are a few good resources: https://www.ashp.org/Professional-Development/Residency-Information , your college's ASHP advisor, local pharmacy practice residency di rectors, and ASHP's Midyear Clinical Meeting, which showcases virtually all of the ASHP-accredited programs.

Public health is defined as the practice of helping members of society live healthier, longer lives. More specifically, public health focuses on improving the general health of co mmunities through efforts to monitor the spread of diseases, initiatives (both clinical and policy-oriented) to prevent disease and disab ility, and by promoting healthy lifestyles through education and community engagement. Public health is both an art and a science. It is practiced by inter-professional teams whose members' training spans a wide array of academic and vocational fields. Of particular importance to public health in our state is determining how to meet the challenges of change and diversity within rural areas. Rural health solutions are es sential to the well-being of North Dakota and to other areas of the nation and the world. North Dakota is an ideal locati on for rural public health research in addition to the application of practical solutions to health improvement fo r rural communities. Public health is an interdisciplinary field; it is common for many people to gain competencies and/or training in a related field (medicine, nursing, pharmacy, business, engineering, etc.) and subsequently move into public health as a matter of vocation or occupation. The MPH degree is uniquely designed to acco mmodate the needs to these individuals. It blends theory and practical knowledge across a wide array of disciplines, and is the \"degree of choice\" among practitioners in the field. The specializations of Community Health Sciences or the Epidemiology with subplan Management of Infectious Diseases are the most suitable for most pharmacists, as t hey prepare health professionals to integrate public health initiatives and policies within traditional medical models. It is designed to provide pharmacists and other health professionals with a better understanding of their diverse roles in public health. For more information on the NDSU MPH program you can visit www.ndsu.edu/publichealth or contact Dr. Stefanie Meyer, at Stefanie.meyer@ndsu.edu. PHARMD/MPH DUAL DEGREE OPTION The Master of Public Health (MPH) offers diverse tracks in public health that build upon the strengths of campus to meet the practical needs of the public and health care practitioners who serve it. The MPH degree consists of 42 credits and can be completed in two years as a full time graduate student. Pharm.D. students are able to complete a Pharm.D./MPH dual degree in as little as one extra year of study. Pharm.D. students who are in good academic standing are eligible to apply for the Pharm.D./MPH program through the graduate school during their P2 year. Why Public Health? Practitioners in our region have limited opportunities for adv anced, practical public health training that focuses on the unique challenges facing this largely rural area that encom passes North Dakota and othe r Northern Plains states. There are many underserved populations living in the region that would benefit from expanded public health interventions. For example, the American Indian commun ities have typically been underserved and significant health disparities between this population and others have result ed. Overall, there is much to be gained from greater collaboration within the Northern Great Pl ains, and the education of public heal th professionals is a natural starting point to facilitate that collaboration. Is the MPH accredited? The NDSU MPH program is accredited through the Council on Education in Public Health (CEPH), https://www.ndsu.edu/public health/about/accreditation/ What are the admission requirements for the Pharm.D./MPH dual degree? You must be enrolled in the Pharm.D. program and in good academic standing. In addition to graduate school requirements (with the exception of the GRE; the PCAT score can be used instead for Pharm.D. students), the MPH Admissions Committee may invite selected applicants for an interview. 64 How do I apply to the Pharm.D./MPH dual degree? You apply online during the spring semester of your P2 year, watch this page for admission information: https://www.ndsu.edu/publichealth /degrees_ and_programs/admission/ . If you are a P1 student and wish to get started early, apply online at the above website but choo se \"Non-Degree\" in the drop down box during the spring semester of your P1 year. This will allow you to take PHRM 632 for Graduate credit. Up to nine graduate credits can be taken as a non-degree student. When can I start the MPH program? Applications are reviewed each year beginning March throug h May for a fall semester start. You may also take up to nine graduate credits as a non-degree seekin g student with permission of the instructor. How much does it cost for MPH courses? Tuition and fees for MPH coursework can be found here: https://www.ndsu.edu/onestop/ accounts/tuition/graduate/ Are there scholarships available? Yes. Express Scripts Scholars Program offers scholarships for Pharm.D. dual degree students. The program provides four (4) $10,000 scholarships nationally each y ear to enrolled dual degree students. The awarded students are given $2,500 per semester for four consecutive semesters, totaling $10,00 0 over two years. For application instructions, please contact: ExpressScriptsScholars@aacp.org . *Not available in 2020* The College of Health Professions has a limited number of scholarships and awards available for assistance to students. Applications for scholarship s and awards are available February 1 of each calendar year on the college web page, www.ndsu.edu/healthprofessions . Deadlines vary. When are MPH courses offered? MPH core courses are generally offered in the eveni ng to accommodate students who work. These courses are only offered in the Fall and Spring semesters. There ar e no summer core courses, although the MPH practicum may be completed during summer. Current students are encour aged to talk with their faculty advisors for the most up-to-date information on course offerings. Does the MPH program accommodate distance learners? MPH students can take their courses on campus at NDSU or off -campus through live video broadcasts of classes (IVN). Since I will not enroll in Phrm 552L in the P3/Public H ealth year, do I still need to complete the required online trainings (e.g. HIPAA, HIPA A Security, NDSU Bloodborne Pathogen, Medicare Fraud, Waste & Abuse, Preventing Methamphetamine Abuse, etc.)? Yes. You will still need to complete the required trainings in t he fall of your P3/Public Health year. In addition, you will need to be registered as a Pharmacy Intern in the state of North Dakota. Can I take courses in more than one area of specialization? Yes, there is a list of electives in each specialization that are available to a ll MPH students. You are welcome to take additional credits if you are interested. Can I change to a different specialization track after starting the MPH program? Yes. You must be in good academic standing within the MPH program and the admissions committee for the specialization you wish to enter must agree that your back ground is sufficient for the transition. Contact the Director of Accreditation if interested. Where can I do my Practicum? Can the Practicum be done in another country? NDMPH has secured Practicum affiliation agreements with local, national, and global sites in public health. Students can also request a Practicum site without an existing a ffiliation agreement, but this must be done a minimum of 6 months in advance of the Practicum start date to ensure that a working agreement can be established. Practicums can be done in other countries as long as an acc eptable agreement can be established beforehand. 65 MPH PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS Course Name Credits PH 704: Public Health Management and Policy 3 PH 706: Essentials in Epidemiology 3 PH 712: Public Health Research Methods 3 PH 720: Environmental Health for Public Health Professionals 2 PH 731: Biostatistics 3 PH 741: Social and Behavioral Sciences 3 PH 745: Community Health Leadership 3 20 credits Additional Required Program Co mponents Course Name Credits Integrated Learning Experience PH 789, ILE 1 Applied Practice Experience/Pr acticum PH 794, Practicum 3 4 credits SPECIALIZATIONS Community Health Sciences The Community Health Sciences specia lization of NDSU's Master of Public Health program prepares leaders in public health to use evidence to improve population health at the comm unity level.

Up to 76 semester hours are required in the pre-professional curriculum. Admission to the professional program is competitive, based upon succes sful pre-pharmacy academic performance and available positions in each class. After successful completion of 76 semester hours, inte rviews, and the Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT), students are admitted to a fou r-year professional program. The Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, one of six academic departments of the College of Health Professions, subscribes to the missions of the College and of North Dakota State Univer sity in the provision of Teaching, Research, and Service. The Department provides instruction in disciplines applicable to science. The faculty design and conduct research in the natural and bi ological sciences, as well as mentor graduate and Professional students in advanced conc epts of pharmaceutical science and in the process of scientific inquiry. NDSU offers both the MS and Ph.D. degrees in Pharmaceutical Sciences. The graduate program emphasizes both research and teaching excellence. The doctor of philoso phy degree is awarded in re cognition of high scholarly achievement as evidenced by a period of successful study, the satisfactory completion of examinations and the development of an acceptable dissertation project covering so me significant aspect of a major field of learning and research. After successful completion of a Ph.D. degree program, students have had a high level of success gaining highly desirable employment in academia, industry and governmental agencies. The dual program (Pharm.D./Ph.D.) is designed to provide an opportunity fo r outstanding professi onal students in the Pharmacy Program at North Dakota State University obtain research experience and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences. It is proposed that this can be accomplished with an additi onal three years of study and research placed between the second and the third years of the four-year professional program. It is believed that the combination of the Pharm.D. and Ph.D. degrees will greatly enhance the student's research background, critical thinking skills, and marketability for leadership positions wi thin the profession of Pharmacy in academic, government, and industrial environments. Summer Research Experience During the summer between the P1 and P2 years, up to si x students per year will be allowed into an introductory research experience phase of the P harm.D./Ph.D. program and will spend twel ve weeks rotating throughout these three research laboratories. A summer stipend will be prov ided for each participating student in return for a 20 hour/week commitment (These funds are to be obtained from the College's differential tuition funds).

They should have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above. At the same time, an application to the graduate school should also be made. The GRE should also be taken by the end of this semester. Pharm.D./Ph.D. applications will be considered by the Department as for all graduate students. Course requirements during the professional program The Pharm.D. curriculum is un changed. In the fall semester of the P1 year, a faculty member(s) will make the students aware of the Phar m.D./Ph.D. option, and briefly outline the program. The Ph.D. Graduate Dissertation Years (i.e. G1, G2, G3) Students will receive a monthly stipend, and tuition waiver dur ing Ph.D. graduate year 1 (G1), year 2 (G2) and year 3 (G3). For this time period the students are full-time graduate students in the Department, subject to the same expectations (e.g. seminar participation, 6 credits of PSCI 790, year-round study, etc.). During the three graduate years, the students will be required to complete STAT 725 (3 cr), BIOC 701 (4 cr) and BIOC 702 (4 cr). In addition, if interested, students may take other 700-level courses available in the department and university. Thus by the end of G3, the students will have a minimum of (12 cr) 600-level and (up to 21 cr) 700-level didactic credits. At the end of three graduate years, students woul d be able to write dissertation and pa ss the final thesis examination. In addition to didactic credits, students will take 1 credit Seminar (PSCI 790) in the fall and the Spring semesters of each of the three graduate years. Student s will also be required to take 60 thesis research credits (PSCI 799) during three graduate years. The Clinical Years (P3 & P4) For the final two years of the professional program, dual degree students will receive a wa iver of NDSU base tuition and pharmacy differential tuition. No changes in the dida ctic coursework of the P3 year are proposed. Program requirements for the participants Once accepted into the dual degree program (i.e. the G1 year and beyond), the student is considered to be a full- time graduate student in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences. They mu st maintain a GPA of 3.0 or above. Ph.D. Summary: 12 credits of 600 and at least 18 out of 21 sug gested credits of 700=30 didactic credits, with 6 credits seminar and 60 credits dissertation gives a total of 96 graduate credits. Up to 12 credits of 600 level courses can be used for the Pharm.D. P3 and P4 years will remain as it is in the traditional Pharm.D. program. Suggested Course Schedule for Pharm.D. /Ph.D. Students P-1 Year: It would remain the same. In summer, students are required to do a research rotation in three laboratories.

Kappa Psi Kappa Psi is a professional, co-ed fraternity whose main purpose is to unite its members and to help them become better professionals. We try to achieve this by being active ly involved in community affa irs, university affairs, and the College of Health Professions. Throughout our history, the Beta Sigma Chapter of Kappa Psi has maintained a stout brotherhood founded on industry, sobriety, fellowship, and high ideals. Our chapt er has been involved in many community service events including volunteering for Bethany Homes, the New Life Center, the American Diabetes Association, the Ro nald McDonald house, the Arthritis F oundation, Dorothy Day Food Pantry. We also provide a monthly meal along with a blood pressure screening at low income housing in West Fargo. We consistently earn the highest cumulative all-Greek GPA. We sponsor an annual Homecoming pig roast, a faculty appreciation dinner, a Spring Formal, and other social acti vities. We are also active on the local, regional, and national levels of Kappa Psi. Kappa Psi was founded in May 1879 at the Russell Military Ac ademy in New Haven, Connecticut. Initially, it was a medical pharmaceutical fraternity and continued as such until 1924. At that time, by mutual agreement, the members of both professions decided to separate into tw o distinct groups. The medical group became Theta Kappa Psi and the Pharmacy group became Kappa Psi. Our c hapter was founded April 25, 1924 and was one of the 27 founding chapters of Kappa Psi Pharmaceutical Fraternity . Our chapter became co-ed in 1998. We continue to thrive on the North Dakota State campus as a source of brotherhood for pharmacy students.

Native American ssional Program (NAPP) To address the critical shor tage of Native American pharmacists in t he United States, the College initiated NAPP (then known as the Native American Pharmacy Program) in September 1987. The program was designed to recruit and facilitate the entry of Native Amer ican students into the College and provi de them with counseling and retention services to increase their chances for academic success. In 2009, NAPP members transformed the pr ogram into a student organi zation and made it inclus ive of all the majors within the College, thus changing the name from Native American Pharmacy Program to Native American Professional Programs. NAPP meets monthly to discuss a variety of topics rela ted to the knowledge and sk ills needed to pursue degrees offered by the College of Health Profes sions at NDSU. Counseling and tutorial services for students, financial aid and scholarship information, and internship and fu ture career opportunities also are presented. The NDSU National Community Pharmaci sts Association Student Chapter (NCPA) NCPA is a national organization representing independent community pharmacy practice. In 1987, the national office began a student outreach program that has founded student chapters in 41 colleges of pharmacy across the nation. The mission of the NCPA student outreach program is to foster entre preneurial spirit in pharmacy students and introduce them to opportunities in independent pharmacy practice and ownership. 74 Established at NDSU in April 2000, the NCPA Student Chapt er provides a forum for students to learn about the many career options available in independent community pr actice. The objectives of the chapter are to promote the profession of pharmacy and the role of independent phar macy in the health care system, and to maintain and expand educational programs and strengthen student member s' professional, business, and leadership abilities. Goals of the chapter are to sponsor pharmacists involved in an innovative practice to speak at meetings, start a management/ownership workshop for students interested in owning their own pharmacy, participate in service activities to the community, and to send students to the NCPA Annual Convention in October of each year. Benefits of membership in the student chapter include a variety of scholarsh ips, low interest student loans, and a student publication called The New Independent in addition to the national journal America's Pharmacist.
