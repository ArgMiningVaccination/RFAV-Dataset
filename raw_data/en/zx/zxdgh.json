These largely plant-based diets can range from eating plans that simply include no meat to plans that include no animal products at all, including no eggs, dairy and even honey. While there is a slight potential for vitamin or mineral deficiencies, when well-planned, a vegetarian diet may provide certain health benefits, and may even save you money at the grocery store. Key Features - Vegetarian diets consist of a variety of eating habits that focus on consuming plant-based foods. - Certain plant-based eating plans not only exclude eating meat, poultry and fish, but also eliminate the consumption of animal products, like eggs, dairy and honey. - Plant-based diets are recognized and recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for their potential impact on personal health, the environment and animal rights. People often follow a vegetarian eating plan for potential health benefits, for religious reasons, or because of a focus on animal rights and/or a desire to make a social and environmental impact. It's a diet and lifestyle that focuses on [plant-based nutrition](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/guide-to-plant-based-diet/). When balanced nutritionally, a vegetarian diet is healthy for all stages of life and, in general, is more environmentally sustainable than meat-based diets, according to a statement from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. There are a variety of vegetarian diet eating styles, each one with a different focus. None of them include meat or poultry. Here are five of the most popular versions. - Pescatarian: A vegetarian diet that includes fish and seafood.. It may or may not include dairy or eggs. - Lacto-ovo vegetarian: A vegetarian diet that includes dairy and eggs. - Lacto-vegetarian: A vegetarian diet that includes dairy products, but no eggs. - Ovo-vegetarian. A vegetarian diet that includes eggs, but no dairy. - Vegan or 100% plant-based. A strict vegetarian diet that includes absolutely no meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy and, for some, even honey. A vegan diet is considered a lifestyle choice, and may also include avoidance of leather, wool and other animal byproducts. |Pros||Cons| | | Vegetarianism at a Glance - What you can eat: All vegetables, fruits, pulses, nuts, seeds and grains are part of every traditional vegetarian diet. Dairy, eggs and other animal by-products are included in less restrictive vegetarian diets. - Why try it: Plant-based eating plans can offer many health benefits, but some plant-based foods may include overly-processed ingredients. - Support for vegetarianism: Plant-based diets, including vegetarian diets, are endorsed by the WHO due to their potential positive impacts on personal health, the environment and animal rights.

How Does the Vegetarian Diet Work? The vegetarian diet allows for an eating plan full of fruits, vegetables, pulses (legumes or beans), whole grains, nuts and seeds\u2014and potentially dairy and eggs, depending on which type of vegetarian eating plan someone chooses to follow. No matter which plan one chooses, research shows that it's important to focus on eating a wide variety of foods in order to achieve balanced nutrition, and supplementation of certain nutrients may be necessary, especially vitamin B12 and [iron](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-iron-supplements/). Studies suggest that vegetarian diets may help people lower their risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, [hypertension](https://www.forbes.com/health/healthy-aging/how-to-lower-blood-pressure/) and certain types of cancer. In fact, a recent study in BMC Medicine observing more than 400,000 U.K adults showed an association between low meat consumption and a lowered risk of certain cancers, such as colorectal, breast and prostate cancer. While it's important to note that researchers say a few issues outside of diet (including participants' cancer detection practices and smoking habits) could have also been at play, they did conclude that \"being a low meat-eater, fish-eater, or vegetarian was associated with a lower risk of all cancer [[1]](#footnote_1).\" One key fact to keep in mind about vegetarian diets is that, just like animal-based foods, not all plant-based foods are optimal choices. Ultra-processed foods, such as processed \"meats\" (like plant-based chicken nuggets), plant-based yogurts and beverages, as well as plant-based processed snacks, may include additives like added sugars or excess salt, and thus should be eaten in moderation. An increased risk of bone disorders, such as osteoporosis, may be possible in some people who follow a vegetarian diet, especially if they omit all dairy products and don't include calcium-rich plant foods. What Experts Say About Vegetarian Diets \"Putting it simply, as with most diets out there, there are ways to do [a vegetarian diet] well and there are ways to do it poorly,\" explains Andrea Del-Olmo, N.D., a naturopathic physician based in Portland, Oregon. \"The most common nutrient deficiencies that I see in vegetarian diets are iron and B12,\" says Del-Olmo. \"Heme iron, or iron from animal sources, is often considered more bioavailable, which means sourcing iron from vegetarian or vegan foods can be a little more tricky.\" It's also possible that vegetarians may have a decreased protein intake, she adds. Additionally, individuals with chronic digestive disorders, such as [irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome/) and irritable bowel disease (IBD) may have a hard time eating a mainly plant-based diet as plants can be more challenging to digest compared to animal proteins due in part to their fiber content. Despite some potential nutrient downsides, a vegetarian diet may be quite beneficial for a wide variety of people, including those who have dyslipidemia (unhealthy levels of fat in the blood), specifically elevated LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol levels. That's because of the \"increased intake of high-fiber foods and a higher intake of fresh fruits and vegetables, which have a positive impact on maintaining [healthy cholesterol levels](https://www.forbes.com/health/healthy-aging/cholesterol-levels/),\" continues Del-Olmo. The Vegetarian Experience Plant-based eating is not new to me, as I was vegetarian and vegan for about 14 years of my life. I slowly started reincorporating animal products into my diet as I studied Chinese medicine, and especially during pregnancy. These days my diet consists mainly of plants, but I do enjoy animal products, such as farm-raised eggs and organic meats. For this review, I dove back into vegetarianism, lacto-ovo to be exact, for seven days to remember the feeling in my body and relive the grocery shopping and meal cooking experiences. A few meals I incorporated into my seven-day vegetarian experience included: - Breakfasts: Stir-fried sweet potatoes with sauteed kale, avocado toast with eggs, or oatmeal loaded with nuts and berries. - Lunches: Miso with salad with tomato, cucumber and olives - Dinners: Three bean chili loaded with vegetables, pasta with chickpea and escarole, lentil soup or curried veggies over rice. - Snacks: Apples with tahini and honey, green smoothies, nuts, or carrots with hummus. During my seven-day vegetarian diet, I noticed that my shopping cart was more colorful, as I stocked up on more fruits and vegetables to take the place of meat. I also found myself eating more grains\u2014such as quinoa, pasta and rice\u2014in order to make my meals feel heartier. As an added bonus, I found my grocery bill was more affordable when I omitted meat from my diet and instead filled in my cart with grains, legumes, fruit and vegetables. Ultimately I returned to my carnivorous ways, and reintroduced meat, seafood and poultry back into my diet. Based just on my personal experience, I find that my digestion and energy levels are best when I omit overly-processed foods and refined sugars, for instance. It has taken me years to define the \"right\" diet for my body, especially as my body changes and ages. Experimenting with food and listening to what my body wants, and how it feels, allows me to make the best choices. So listen to your body. While one of the many varieties of a vegetarian diet may be ideal for you, it's important to do your own research, talk with your doctor or a nutritionist and make sure you feel your best while following this particular diet.
