WHO Member States have agreed on a time-bound set of nine voluntary global targets to be attained by 2025. Th ere are targets to reduce harmful use of alcohol, insuffi cient physical activity, salt/sodium intake, tobacco use and hypertension, halt the rise in diabetes and of obesity, and improve coverage of treatment for prevention of heart attacks and strokes. Th ere is also a target for improved avail- ability and aff ordability of technologies and essen- tial medicines to manage NCDs. Countries need to make progress on all these targets to attain the overarching target of a 25% reduction of premature mortality from the four major NCDs by 2025. Out of the 38 million deaths due to NCDs in 2012, more than 40% were premature, aff ecting people under 70 years of age. Th e majority of pre- mature NCD deaths are preventable. Th is report gives encouraging evidence that premature NCD deaths can indeed be signifi cantly reduced world- wide. Deaths from cardiovascular diseases have been dramatically reduced in many high-income countries owing to government policies which facil- itate the adoption of healthier lifestyles and provi- sion of equitable health care. It is imperative that this favourable shift be sustained and, if possible, accelerated in developed countries and replicated in low- and middle-income countries. NCDs are driven by the eff ects of globalization on marketing and trade, rapid urbanization and population ageing - factors over which the indi-vidual has little control and over which the con- ventional health sector also has little sway. While individual behaviour change is important, tackling NCDs defi nitively requires leadership at the highest levels of government, policy development that involve all government departments, and progress towards universal health coverage. Th e primary target audience of this report are Ministers of Health. Th e report provides informa- tion on voluntary global targets and how to scale up national eff orts to attain them, in a sustainable manner. Th e 2010 baseline estimates on NCD mor- tality and risk factors are provided so that countries may begin reporting to WHO on progress made in attaining the targets, starting in 2015. Th e country case studies on successful prevention and control of NCDs highlighted in the report can be instructive for others facing similar challenges. As discussed in this report, there is an agreed set of very cost-eff ective - and globally applicable - NCD interventions for attaining all nine targets by 2025. Each country needs to apply them within its specifi c local conditions and contexts, drawing on the best available evidence. Ministers assembled at the United Nations General Assembly in July 2014, agreed that there are no reasons why any country - low- middle- or high-income - should delay moving forward with their implementation. Delay in taking action will result in worsening of the NCD burden and an increase in health-care costs. Th e most important message of the second global report on NCDs is that, today, the global commu- nity has the chance to change the course of the NCD epidemic. Th e world now has a truly global agenda for prevention and control of NCDs, with shared responsibilities for all countries based on concrete targets. Th is is an historic opportunity to tackle the NCD epidemic that no country can aff ord to miss. Message from the Director-General Dr Margaret Chan Director-GeneralWorld Health Organization ixNoncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are one of the major health and development challenges of the 21st century, in terms of both the human suff er- ing they cause and the harm they infl ict on the socioeconomic fabric of countries, particularly low- and middle-income countries. No government can aff ord to ignore the rising burden of NCDs. In the absence of evidence-based actions, the human, social and economic costs of NCDs will continue to grow and overwhelm the capacity of countries to address them. Recognizing the devastating social, economic and public health impact of NCDs, in September 2011, world leaders adopted a political declaration con-taining strong commitments to address the global burden of NCDs and gave several assignments to the World Health Organization (WHO) to help support country eff orts. One of them was the development of the WHO Global action plan for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013-2020 (known as the Global NCD Action Plan), including nine voluntary global targets and a global monitor- ing framework. Th e Global NCD Action Plan and the voluntary global targets were adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2013. Th e nine voluntary global NCD targets under- score the importance of prioritizing country action to reduce harmful use of alcohol, insuffi cient phys- ical activity, salt/sodium intake, tobacco use and hypertension; halt the rise of obesity and diabetes; and improve coverage of treatment for prevention of heart attacks and strokes and access to basic tech- nologies and medicines. In order to support the implementation of the Global NCD Action Plan, WHO has established a Global coordination mechanism, which will enhance coordination of NCD activities, multi-stakeholder engagement and action across different sectors. Additional support for the implementation of the Global NCD Action Plan will be provided by the United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Pre- vention and Control of NCDs, established by the Secretary-General to coordinate the relevant United Nations organizations and other intergovernmental organizations. Th is second global status report comes at a time when only a decade is left to achieve the internation- ally agreed voluntary global NCD targets. It is also a time when we can be more optimistic about the future of prevention and control of NCDs, than per- haps at any stage in recent history. In order to attain the global NCD targets, governments, international partners and WHO will need to work together, shar- ing and exchanging evidence and information and taking necessary steps for reducing gaps in capacity and resources. No country should be left behind, as the world steps decisively into the future to address one of the greatest public health challenges of the 21st century.Preface Dr Oleg ChestnovAssistant Director-GeneralNoncommunicable Disease and Mental HealthWorld Health OrganizationGlobal status report on NCDs 2014 xBMI body mass index CTCA Centre for Tobacco Control in Africa DALY disability-adjusted life-year ECOSOC Economic and Social Council HAI Health Action International HbA1c haemoglobin A1c HiAP health in all policies (WHO framework) ISH International Society of Hypertension MET metabolic equivalent NCD noncommunicable disease NGO nongovernmental organization PAHO Pan American Health Organization PEN (WHO) package of essential noncommunicable disease interventions SARA Service Availability and Readiness Assessment TAPS tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship UK United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland UN United Nations USA United States of America VIA visual inspection with acetic acid WHA World Health Assembly WHO World Health Organization WHO FCTC WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco ControlAbbreviationsxiExecutive summary Th is global status report is the second in a triennial series tracking worldwide progress in prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Th e primary target audience of this report are ministers of health. Other target audiences include poli- cy-makers in health and relevant non-health sectors, health offi cials, nongovernmental organizations, academia, development agencies and civil society. Th e human, social and economic consequences of NCDs are felt by all countries but are particularly devastating in poor and vulnerable populations. Reducing the global burden of NCDs is an overriding priority and a necessary condition for sustainable development. As the leading cause of death globally, NCDs were responsible for 38 million (68%) of the world's 56 million deaths in 2012. More than 40% of them (16 million) were premature deaths under age 70 years. Almost three quarters of all NCD deaths (28 million), and the majority of premature deaths (82%), occur in low- and middle-income countries. During 2011-2025, cumulative economic losses due to NCDs under a \"business as usual\" scenario in low- and middle-income countries have been estimated at US$ 7 trillion. Th is sum far outweighs the annual US$ 11.2 billion cost of implementing a set of high-impact interventions to reduce the NCD burden. In September 2011, world leaders agreed on a roadmap of concrete commitments to address the global burden of NCDs, including a commitment to establish multisectoral action plans and policies for the prevention and control of NCDs. To accelerate national eff orts to address NCDs, in 2013 the World Health Assembly adopted a comprehensive global monitoring framework with 25 indicators and nine voluntary global targets for 2025 (Annex 1). Th e World Health Assembly also endorsed a set of actions organized around the World Health Organization (WHO) Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013-2020 ( Global NCD Action Plan 2013-2020) which, when implemented collectively by Member States, international partners and WHO, will help to achieve the commitments made by world leaders in September 2011. Th e set of actions is organized around six objectives (see Box 1.2 ), aimed at strengthening national capacity, multisectoral action and boosting international cooperation to reduce exposure to risk factors, strengthen health systems, and monitor progress in attaining the global NCD targets. In July 2014, the United Nations General Assembly conducted a review to assess progress in implementing the 2011 Political Declaration, and recognized the progress achieved at national level since September 2011. Recognizing also that progress in implementing the roadmap of commitments included in the 2011 Political Decla- ration was insuffi cient and highly uneven, and that continued and increased eff orts are essential, the members of the United Nations committed themselves to a set of measures within four priority areas - governance, prevention, health care, and sur- veillance and monitoring. Th ese time-bound measures include setting national NCD targets consistent with global targets, developing national NCD multisectoral plans by Global status report on NCDs 2014xii2015, and starting implementation of those plans by 2016, in order to achieve the national targets. This global status report on prevention and control of NCDs (2014), is framed around the nine voluntary global targets. The report provides data on the current situation, identifying bottlenecks as well as opportunities and priority actions for attaining the targets. The 2010 baseline estimates on NCD mortality and risk factors are provided so that countries can report on progress, starting in 2015. In addition, the report also provides the latest available estimates on NCD mortality (2012) and risk factors (2010 and 2014). All ministries of health need to set national NCD targets and lead the development and implemen - tation of policies and interventions to attain them. There is no single pathway to attain NCD targets that fits all countries, as they are at different points in their progress in the prevention and control of NCDs and at different levels of socioeconomic development. However all countries can benefit from the comprehensive response to attaining the voluntary global targets presented in this report. Global target 1: A 25% relative reduction in overall mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases Progress in attaining all other targets contributes to the attainment of this overarching target on prema - ture mortality. Chapter 1 presents 2012 mortality data that show that (i) NCDs affect all countries; (ii) their impact is particularly severe in low- and middle-income countries; and (iii) the majority of premature NCD deaths occur in low- and mid - dle-income countries. The ability to meet this target will vary greatly across the world. While low- and middle-income countries could use a target of 25%, high-income countries that are already showing a decline in major NCDs may want to set their targets higher than 25%. Chapter 1 outlines the comprehensive, multi - sectoral policy actions, interventions and country capacity, including civil/vital registration and sur - veillance systems, required to attain this target. The shortage of resources in many countries means that implementation of the very cost-effective policy options and interventions (\"best buys\") would have to be accorded the highest priority. Global target 2: At least 10% relative reduction in the harmful use of alcohol as appropriate, within the national context In 2012, an estimated 5.9% (3.3 million) of all deaths worldwide and 5.1% of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were attributable to alcohol consumption. More than half of these deaths resulted from NCDs. The level of alcohol consumption worldwide in 2010 was estimated at 6.2 litres of pure alcohol per person aged 15 years and over (equivalent to 13.5 g of pure alcohol per day). The prevalence of heavy episodic drinking is associated with the overall levels of alcohol consumption and is highest in the WHO European Region and the Region of the Americas. There are cost-effective policy options to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. They include pricing policies, reduced availability and marketing of alcohol, improved response by health services, and drink-driving policies and countermeasures. Indi - vidual interventions such as screening for harmful drinking and treatment of alcohol dependence are also effective, although they are more costly to implement than population-based measures. As discussed in Chapter 2, a certain amount of progress in addressing the harmful use of alcohol has been made since the Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol was endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2010. Increasing num - bers of countries have developed or reformulated their national alcohol policies and action plans. Of 76 countries with a written national policy on alco - hol, 52 have taken steps to operationalize it. Some 160 WHO Member States have regulations on age limits for sale of alcoholic beverages. Global target 3: A 10% relative reduction in the prevalence of insufficient physical activity Insufficient physical activity contributes to 3.2 m il- lion deaths and 69.3 million DALYs each year. Adults who are insufficiently physically active have a higher risk of all-cause mortality compared with xiiiExecutive summary those who do at least 150 minutes of moderate-in - tensity physical activity per week, or equivalent, as recommended by WHO. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of ischaemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and breast and colon cancer. In 2010, 23% of adults aged 18 years and over were insufficiently physically active. Women were less active than men and older people were less active than younger people. Globally, 81% of adoles - cents aged 11-17 years were insufficiently physically active in 2010. Adolescent girls were less active than adolescent boys, with 84% versus 78% not meeting the WHO recommendation of 60 minutes of phys - ical activity per day. Several high-income countries have reported increased physical activity over the past decade as a result of national policies and programmes to improve physical activity. In recent years, more low- and middle-income countries have also set up initiatives to address physical inactivity. Reaching the physical activity target requires multisectoral collaboration between transport, urban planning, recreation, and sports and education departments, to create safe environments that are conducive to physical activity for all age groups. Global target 4: A 30% relative reduction in the mean population intake of salt /sodium Excess consumption of dietary sodium is associated with increased risk of hypertension and cardiovas - cular disease. Globally, 1.7 million annual deaths from cardiovascular causes have been attributed to excess sodium intake. Current estimates suggest that the global mean intake of salt is around 10 g daily (4 g/day of sodium). WHO recommends a reduction in salt intake to less than 5 g/day (2 g/day of sodium), to reduce blood pressure and the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. The main source of salt in many countries is processed foods and ready-made meals, while salt added during the preparation of food at home and at the table is significant in others. With the greater availability of processed foods in low- and middle-income countries, sources of sodium are shifting rapidly towards these foods.As discussed in Chapter 4, establishing a base- line of salt intake is key to setting national targets and devising effective consumer campaigns. Sodi - um-reduction targets need to be established for each category of food, prioritizing the ones that contribute most to population intake. Policies aimed at reducing population-wide salt consumption should be intersectoral and multidis - ciplinary and include the participation of all rel - evant stakeholders. They should be applicable to diverse settings and make use of all available tools, including labelling, legislation, product reformula - tion, fiscal incentives that encourage the production and consumption of foods with reduced sodium content, and consumer education to ensure their effective implementation. Considerable progress has been made in implementing these activities in some countries. Global target 5: A 30% relative reduction in prevalence of current tobacco use in persons aged 15+ years It is estimated that currently around 6 million people die annually from tobacco use, with over 600 000 deaths due to exposure to second-hand smoke. Measures to ensure reduction in tobacco use include: protecting people from second-hand smoke through national \"100% smoke-free\" legisla - tion; offering help in quitting tobacco use, warning people about the dangers of tobacco use; enforcing bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and spon - sorship; and raising tobacco taxes. Considerable progress has been made in global tobacco control in recent years, in both the number of countries protecting their population and the number of people worldwide protected by effective tobacco-control measures. In 2013, 95 countries had implemented at least one of the four tobacco control \"best-buy\" interventions (very cost-effective interventions), at the highest level of achievement, and two countries had all four \"best-buys\" in place at the highest level. Many of the countries making progress in implementing \"best-buy\" measures were low- or middle-income countries. Global status report on NCDs 2014xivAs discussed in Chapter 5, more work is needed in many countries to pass and enforce effective tobacco-control measures. This includes expanding activities to implement \"best-buy\" demand-reduction measures at the highest level of achievement, where they have not been yet implemented; reinforcing and sustaining exist - ing programmes to incorporate a full range of m easures; and, ultimately, implementing the full WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The achievements of the majority of countries in applying tobacco demand-reduction measures demonstrate that it is possible to tackle the tobacco epidemic irrespective of a country's size or level of development. Global target 6: A 25% relative reduction in the prevalence of raised blood pressure, or contain the prevalence of raised blood pressure, according to national circumstances Raised blood pressure is estimated to have caused 9.4 million deaths and 7% of disease burden - as measured in DALYs - in 2010. If left uncontrolled, hypertension causes stroke, myocardial infarc - tion, cardiac failure, dementia, renal failure and blindness. There is strong scientific evidence of the health benefits of lowering blood pressure through population-wide and individual (behavioural and pharmacological) interventions. The global preva - lence of raised blood pressure (defined as systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure equal to or above 140/90 mmHg) in adults aged 18 years and over was around 22% in 2014. Many modifiable factors contribute to the high prevalence rates of hypertension. They include eat - ing food containing too much salt and fat, inade- quate intake of fruits and vegetables, overweight and obesity, harmful use of alcohol, physical inactivity, psychological stress, socioeconomic determinants, and inadequate access to health care. Worldwide, detection, treatment and control of hypertension are inadequate, owing to weaknesses in health sys - tems, particularly at the primary care level. In order to achieve this target, population-wide policies and interventions are required to address these modifiable risk factors. In addition, integrated programmes need to be established at the primary care level, to improve the efficiency and effective - ness of detection and management of hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors through a total-risk approach, as recommended by WHO. Global target 7: Halt the rise in diabetes and obesity Obesity increases the likelihood of diabetes, hyper - tension, coronary heart disease, stroke and certain types of cancer. Worldwide, the prevalence of obesity has nearly doubled since 1980. In 2014, 11% of men and 15% of women aged 18 years and older were obese. More than 42 million children under the age of 5 years were overweight in 2013. The global prev - alence of diabetes in 2014 was estimated to be 9%. Obesity and diabetes can be prevented through multisectoral action that simultaneously addresses different sectors that contribute to the production, distribution and marketing of food, while concur - rently shaping an environment that facilitates and promotes adequate levels of physical activity. Diabetes risk can be reduced by moderate weight loss and moderate daily physical activity in per - sons at high risk. This intervention has been scaled up to the whole population in a small number of high-income countries. However, it is difficult to implement this intervention at scale in low- and middle-income countries, partly because current methods for identifying people at high risk are cumbersome and rather costly. Further research is urgently needed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to prevent obesity and diabetes. Global target 8: At least 50% of eligible people receive drug therapy and counselling (including glycaemic control) to prevent heart attacks and strokes Cardiovascular disease was the leading cause of NCD deaths in 2012 and was responsible for 17.5 m illion deaths, or 46% of NCD deaths. Of these deaths, an estimated 7.4 million were due to heart attacks (ischaemic heart disease) and 6.7 million were due to strokes.xvExecutive summary Th is target to reduce heart attacks and strokes is aimed at improving the coverage of drug treatment and counselling in people with raised cardiovascu- lar risk and established disease. It is an aff ordable intervention that can be delivered through a pri- mary health-care approach, even in resource-con- strained settings Th ere are major gaps in the coverage of this intervention to prevent heart attacks and strokes, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Poor access to basic services in primary care, lack of aff ordability of laboratory tests and medicines, inappropriate patterns of clinical practice, and poor adherence to treatment are some of the main rea- sons for these treatment gaps. Th is intervention to prevent heart attacks and strokes needs to be part of the basic benefi ts package for moving towards universal health coverage. In addition, context-specifi c strategies will be required to address multiple gaps in health systems related to access to basic technologies and medicines, the health workforce, service delivery, health informa- tion, and referral, with a special focus on primary care. Several countries have already included this intervention in the basic benefi ts package, and have taken steps to implement it through a primary health care approach. Global target 9: An 80% availability of the a ordable basic technologies and essential medicines, including generics, required to treat major noncommunicable diseases in both public and private facilities Th is target includes the basic requirement of tech- nologies and medicines for implementing cost-ef- fective primary care interventions to address cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma. Th e essential medicines include aspirin, a statin, an angiotensin-converting enzyme insulin, a bronchodilator and a steroid inhalant. Th e basic technologies include, at least, a blood pressure mea- surement device, a weighing scale, height measur- ing equipment, blood sugar and blood cholesterol measurement devices with strips, and urine strips for albumin assay. Th ese are minimum requirements, without which even basic NCD interventions cannot be imple- mented in primary care. Currently, there are major gaps in the aff ordability and availability of basic health technologies and essential medicines, par- ticularly in low- and middle-income countries. Th e lack of access means that patients delay seeking care and either develop complications unnecessarily or pay high out-of-pocket costs, which can fi nancially devastate households. Sustainable health fi nancing is necessary to ensure adequate and reliable pro- curement and distribution systems to guarantee the supply of technologies and essential NCD medicines to all levels of health care, including primary care. Consequently, national policies that encourage the availability of basic health technologies and essential medicines should be central to eff orts focused on achieving universal health coverage. Drugs must also be used appropriately, so there must be adherence to evidence-based guidelines and education in rational use for both health-care professionals and patients. Policies and interventions to attain the nine tar- gets (see Chapters 1-9 ), should be given high pri- ority and budgeted in national multisectoral NCD action plans. Chapter 10, on the development of a national multisectoral NCD plan, highlights the key NCD domains that should be covered: governance, prevention and reduction of risk factors, health care, and surveillance and monitoring. T o maximize the chances of eff ective implementation, the process of development of the plan must necessarily engage all stakeholders in health and non-health sectors, including civil society and the private sector. Th e fi nal chapter presents the way forward to attain the nine voluntary global targets by 2025, and highlights the key messages of this report. Message 1: Noncommunicable diseases act as key barriers to poverty alleviation and sustainable development Th e data presented in this report demonstrate that NCDs aff ect all countries and that the burden of Global status report on NCDs 2014 xvideath and disease is heavily concentrated in low- and middle-income countries. Loss of productivity due to premature deaths, and the individual and national costs of addressing NCDs, act as important barriers to poverty reduction and sustainable development. Progress in attaining the NCD targets is therefore vital for attaining the sustainable development goals. Message 2: While some countries are making progress, the majority are o course to meet the global NCD targets As many motivational case-studies illustrate, countries in which political leaders have shown high commitment are already making signifi cant advances in addressing NCDs. However, progress remains uneven and inadequate. Data presented in this report identify many missed opportunities to strengthen governance, prevention and reduction of risk factors, health care, and surveillance and monitoring, particularly in low- and middle-in- come countries. Message 3: Countries can move from political commitment to action by prioritizing high-impact, a ordable interventions It is evident that a lack of interventions is clearly not the primary obstacle for inadequate progress in prevention and control of NCDs. High rates of death and disease, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, are a refl ection of inadequate investment in cost-eff ective NCD interventions. Resources should be used strategically to improve NCD outcomes. All countries can move from commitment to action, by prioritized implementation of very cost-eff ective pol- icies and interventions (\"best buys\"). Message 4: All countries need to set national NCD targets and be accountable for attaining them Th e nine voluntary global targets give a clear signal of where the world can be by 2025 in relation to NCDs. All countries need to set national targets and establish a monitoring framework to track progress in attaining them. Since the global targets focus on a limited set of key NCD outcomes, set- ting national targets and implementing policies and interventions to attain them will enable countries to make the best use of resources. For best results, lessons learnt from implementation should be rapidly incorporated in decision-making, through operational research. Message 5: Structures and processes for multisectoral and intersectoral collaboration need to be established Collaboration across sectors outside health (multi- sectoral collaboration) and between the government and non-state actors (intersectoral collaboration) is key to equitable prevention and control of NCDs and to attainment of national targets. Mechanisms and processes to facilitate multisectoral and inter- sectoral collaboration need to be embedded in the planning stage of NCD programmes and should continue through implementation, enactment of public policies, and monitoring and evaluation. Message 6: Investment in health systems is critical for improving NCD outcomes Analysis of health systems shows that gaps in the key elements of the health system, particularly at the primary care level present obstacles to the provision of equitable health care for people suff ering from NCDs. Health-system strengthening - including health fi nancing, governance, the health workforce, health information, access to basic technologies and essential medicines, and health-service delivery - should be a major focus of scaling up NCD preven- tion and control. Th e global move towards universal health coverage off ers an opportunity to explicitly prioritize very cost-eff ective NCD interventions in basic benefi ts packages.xviiExecutive summary Message 7: Institutional and human resource capacities and nancial resources for NCD prevention and control require strengthening Attainment of national targets requires institutional and human resources capacity as well as adequate fi nancial resources to deal with the complexity of issues relating to NCD prevention and control, such as interaction with food and agricultural systems, law, trade, transport and urban planning. Th e com- petency and capacity of the health workforce to address NCDs will require strengthening, including through incorporation of public health aspects of NCD prevention and control in the teaching cur- ricula for medical, nursing and allied health per- sonnel, and provision of in-service training. While governments must continue to recognize their primary responsibility in responding to the challenge of NCDs, setting their national targets and developing their national plans of action, achieving the global targets will require the eff orts and engagement of all sectors of society at national, regional and global levels. Th ere are new global mechanisms in place to accelerate national NCD action. Th e United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs, which the Secretary-General established in June 2013 and placed under the leadership of WHO, is coordi- nating the activities of the relevant United Nations organizations and other intergovernmental orga- nizations to support the realization of the commit- ments made by world leaders in the 2011 Political Declaration on NCDs, in particular through the implementation of the WHO Global NCD Action Plan 2013-2020. Th e Task Force's terms of refer- ence were adopted by the United Nations Economic and Social Council in July 2014. In September 2014, WHO established the WHO Global Coordination Mechanism on the Prevention and Control of NCDs, to facilitate and enhance coordination of activities, multi-stakeholder engagement and action across sectors at the local, national, regional and global levels, in order to contribute to the imple- mentation of the WHO Global NCD Action Plan 2013-2020. WHO has a leadership and coordination role to play in promoting and monitoring action against NCDs. As the primary specialized United Nations agency for health, WHO will continue to support national NCD eff orts to implement the Global NCD Action Plan 2013-2020. Key areas of contin- ued action in 2015 and beyond include, providing global leadership and off ering technical assistance to Member States to set national targets, develop and implement national NCD policies and plans to reach these national targets, and assess trends and monitor progress. In 2015, WHO plans to complete work on a framework to promote country action across health and non-health sectors, as well as on an approach to register and publish contributions of non-state actors to the achievement of the nine voluntary global targets. Th e global architecture and the commitment of countries to address eff ectively the NCD epidemic have never been better. Attainment of the nine global NCD targets by 2025 will help to curb the rapid growth and devastating health and socioeco- nomic impacts of the NCD epidemic. It is a huge task, fraught with many challenges. However, inac- tion will not be forgiven by future generations. Th ey will have the right to ask why decisive action was not taken, if we allow this chance of altering history to slip through our fi ngers.1Th e adverse human, social and economic consequences of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are felt by all societies and economies, but they are particularly devastating in poor and vulnerable populations ( 14). Since the fi rst global status report on NCDs (2010) was published ( 3), the global agenda on NCDs has moved forward considerably (see Fig I.1 ). In September 2011, at a United Nations high-level meeting on NCDs, heads of state and government formally recognized these diseases as a major threat to economies and societies and placed them high on the development agenda. Th at meeting agreed on a bold set of commitments to address the global burden of NCDs (5). In order to translate these commitments into action, in May 2013 the Sixty-sixth World Health Assembly adopted the Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 20132020 (known as the Global NCD Action Plan) and a comprehensive global monitoring framework, including a set of nine voluntary global targets (see Box I.1 ) and 25 indicators (see Annex 1 ) (1). Th is second World Health Organization global status report on noncommunicable diseases (2014) is structured according to these nine voluntary global targets, which will need to be attained by 2025 if the world is to realize the commitments made in the United Nations' Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases (5).Introduction: Current status of the global agenda on prevention and control of noncommunicab le diseases Fig. I.1 Global milestones in the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases Global status report on NCDs 2014 2Th e 2011 Political Declaration ( 5) was one of the major global milestones in the prevention and control of NCDs (see Fig. I.1 ). It reaffi rmed the lead- ership and coordination role of the World Health Organization (WHO) and gave it several time- bound assignments, which have been completed, as set out below.. Th e Global NCD Action Plan builds on key strat- egies and resolutions ( 616 ). It has six objectives (see Box I.2 ), each off ering a menu of policy options and actions for implementation by Member States, international partners and WHO.Th e overarching goal of the Global NCD Action Plan is to achieve the 2025 voluntary global targets (see Box I.1 ). Th ere has been remarkable progress in implementing the fi rst objective of the plan. Inter- national cooperation and advocacy have raised the priority accorded to prevention and control of NCDs. Addressing NCDs is now recognized as a priority not only for health but also for social development and investments in people ( 1728 ). An NCD target has been incorporated in the sustainable development goals and NCDs are poised to be an integral com-ponent of the post-2015 development agenda ( 29). Progress in implementation of the other objectives Box I.1 Voluntary global targets for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases to be attained by 2025 (1) A 25% relative reduction in the overall mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, dia- betes, or chronic respiratory diseases (2) At least 10% relative reduction in the harmful use of alcohol, as appropriate, within the natio-nal context (3) A 10% relative reduction in prevalence of insu cient physical activity (4) A 30% relative reduction in mean population intake of salt/sodium (5) A 30% relative reduction in prevalence of current tobacco use (6) A 25% relative reduction in the prevalence of raised blood pressure or contain the prevalence of raised blood pressure, according to national circumstances (7) Halt the rise in diabetes and obesity (8) At least 50% of eligible people receive drug therapy and counselling (including glycaemic control) to prevent heart attacks and strokes (9) An 80% availability of the a ordable basic technologies and essential medicines, including generics, required to treat major noncommunicable diseases in both public and private facilities3Introduction of the Global NCD Action Plan, and attainment of the global targets, are largely determined by target-ori- ented action, capacity and resources at country level. Th e aim of this global status report on NCDs is to further support the implementation of the Global NCD Action Plan by: providing information on voluntary global tar- gets and national NCD targets and advice on how to scale up national eff orts to attain them in the context of implementation of multisectoral national action plans; providing the 2010 baseline estimates on NCD mortality and risk factors (see Annexes 2-4 ), so that countries may begin reporting to WHO on progress made in attaining the targets, starting in 2015; providing the latest available estimates on NCD mortality (2012) and risk factors (see Annexes 2-4 ); presenting case-studies of successful country and regional action, to demonstrate how implemen- tation barriers could be overcome at the country level to attain national targets (see Chapters 1-11 ). Th e primary target audience of this report are ministers of health. Other target audiences include policy-makers in health and relevant non-health sec- tors, health offi cials, nongovernmental organizations, academia, development agencies and civil society. Since the United Nations high-level meeting, WHO - through its governing bodies and with the participation of Member States - has also completed other global assignments ( 30) that will support the implementation of the action plan at global, regional and country levels. Th ese assign- ments include the development of: a limited set of action plan indicators for moni- toring progress in implementing the Global NCD Action Plan; the terms of reference for the United Nations Interagency Task Force for the Prevention and Control of NCDs, established by the Secretary-General; the terms of reference for the global coordination mechanism for prevention and control of NCDs. Th e Interagency Task Force has been established to facilitate the response of the United Nations sys- tem to country demand for technical assistance. It will be convened by WHO and will report to the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) through the Secretary-General ( 31). Th e purpose of the global coordination mech- anism is to facilitate and enhance coordination of activities, multistakeholder engagement, and action, across sectors at global, regional and national levels. Th e aim will be to contribute to the implementa- tion of the Global NCD Action Plan, while avoiding Box I.2 Objectives of the Global NCD Action Plan ( 1) 1. To raise the priority accorded to the prevention and control of NCDs in global, regional and national agendas and internationally agreed development goals, thr ough strengthened international cooperation and advoca- cy. 2. To strengthen national capacity, leadership, governance, multisectoral action and partnerships to accelerate country response for the prevention and control of NCDs. 3. To reduce modi able risk factors for NCDs and underlying social determinants through creation of health-pro- moting environments. 4. To strengthen and orient health systems to address the prevention and control of NCDs and the underlying social determinants through people-centred primary health care and universal health coverage. 5. To promote and support national capacity for high-quality research and development for the prevention and control of NCDs. 6. To monitor the trends and determinants of NCDs and evaluate progress in their prevention and control.Global status report on NCDs 2014 4duplication of eff orts and using resources effi ciently (32). On 1011 July 2014, the United Nations General Assembly conducted a comprehensive review, tak- ing stock of progress in implementing the commit- ments of the Political Declaration ( 5), identifying ways to address gaps, and reaffi rming political com- mitment to respond to the challenge of NCDs ( 33). Th e commitments made by countries in the out- come document include the following: Building on the guidance provided by the WHO Global NCD Action Plan 20132020 ( 1): integrate NCDs into health planning and national development plans; by 2015, set national NCD targets for 2025, con- sistent with voluntary global targets; by 2015, develop national NCD multisectoral plans to achieve the national targets; by 2016, implement policies and interventions to reduce NCD risk factors and underlying social determinants; by 2016, strengthen and orient health systems to address NCDs, through people-centred primary health care and universal health coverage; report on the progress in attaining the global targets, using the established indicators in the global monitoring framework. Member States have agreed that the United Nations will convene a third high-level meeting on NCDs in 2018 to take stock of national progress (33). As discussed in this report, much remains to be done in all countries, and especially in donor-de- pendent nations, to attain the voluntary global tar- gets by 2025 (see Box I.3 ). Th ere is no single path- way to attain NCD targets that fi ts all countries, as they are at diff erent points in their progress in the prevention and control of NCDs and at diff erent levels of socioeconomic development. However all countries can benefi t from the information and guidance presented in this report, on voluntary global targets and national NCD targets and how to scale up national eff orts to attain them.

NCDs currently cause more deaths than all other causes combined and NCD deaths are projected to increase from 38 million in 2012 to 52 million by 2030. Four major NCDs (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes) are responsible for 82% of NCD deaths. Approximately 42% of all NCD deaths globally occurred before the age of 70 years; 48% of NCD deaths in low- and middle-income countries and 28% in high-income countries were in individuals aged under 70 years. A well-functioning civil/vital registration system is vital for monitoring progress towards attainment of global target 1. In order to attain the premature mortality target, cost-eff ective policies and interventions aimed at attaining the other eight NCD targets, should be prioritized and implemented.Key points9Mortality from noncommunicable diseases A total of 56 million deaths occurred worldwide during 2012. Of these, 38 mil- lion were due to NCDs, principally cardiovascular diseases, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases ( 1). Nearly three quarters of these NCD deaths (28 million) occurred in low- and middle-income countries. Th e number of NCD deaths has increased worldwide and in every region since 2000, when there were 31 million NCD deaths. NCD deaths have increased the most in the WHO South-East Asia Region, from 6.7 million in 2000 to 8.5 million in 2012, and in the Western Pacifi c Region, from 8.6 million to 10.9 million (see Fig. 1.1 ). While the annual number of deaths due to infectious disease is projected to decline, the total annual number of NCD deaths is projected to increase to 52 million by 2030 ( 2,3). Th e leading causes of NCD deaths in 2012 were: cardiovascular diseases (17.5 million deaths, or 46.2% of NCD deaths), cancers (8.2 million, or 21.7% of NCD deaths), respiratory diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4.0 million, or 10.7% of NCD deaths) and diabetes (1.5 mil- lion, or 4% of NCD deaths). Th us, these four major NCDs were responsible for 82% of NCD deaths.

Age-standardized death rates refl ect the risk of dying from NCDs, regardless of the total population size or whether the average age in the population is high or low. In 2012, the age-standardized NCD death rate was 539 per 100 000 population globally. Th e rate was lowest in high-income countries (397 per 100 000) and highest in low-income countries (625 per 100 000) and lower-middle-income countries (673 per 100 000). Regionally, age-standardized death rates for NCDs ranged from 438 per 100 000 in the WHO Region of the Americas to over 650 per 100 000 in the WHO African, South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean Regions. Premature death is a major consideration when evaluating the impact of NCDs on a given popu-lation, with approximately 42% of all NCD deaths occurring before the age of 70 years in 2012. Th is represents 16 million deaths - an increase from 2000 when there were 14.6 million NCD deaths before the age of 70 years. Th e majority of premature deaths (82%), are in low- and middle-income countries. In low- and middle-income countries, a higher propor- tion (48%) of all NCD deaths are estimated to occur in people under the age of 70 years, compared with high-income countries (28%). Fig. 1.3 shows the proportion of NCD deaths by cause in 2012 among people under the age of 70 years. Cardiovascular diseases were responsible for the largest proportion of NCD deaths under the age of 70 years (37%), followed by cancers (27%), and chronic respiratory diseases (8%). Diabetes was responsible for 4% and other NCDs were responsible for approximately 24% of NCD deaths under the age of 70 years. Monitoring premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases Th e premature mortality target is, a 25% reduction in overall mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases by 2025 (referred to as \"25\u00d725\"). Th e probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years from these four diseases, is the indicator in the global Fig. 1.2 Age-standardized NCD death rates (per 100 000 population), all ages, by WHO region, comparable estimates, 2012 ( 1) 800 600400200 0Age-standardized NCD death rates (per 100,000 population) AFR=African Region, AMR=Region of the Americas, SEAR =South-East Asia Region, EUR=European Region, EMR=Eastern Mediterranean Region, WPR=Western Pacic RegionAFR AMR EMR EUR SEAR WPR Fig. 1.3 Proportion of global deaths under the age 70 years, by cause of death, comparable estimates, 2012 (1) Communicable maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions 34% Malignant neoplasm 27%Chapter 1.

Th e probability of dying from one of the four main NCDs between ages 30 and 70 by country is shown in Fig. 1.5a and Fig. 1.5b . In 2012, a 30-year-old individual had a 19% chance of dying from one of the four main NCDs before his or her 70th birthday. Th is represents an improvement over 2000, when the same 30-year- old individual would have had a 23% chance of dying from these diseases. Th is probability varied by region, from 15% in the Region of the Americas to 25% in the South-East Asia Region (see Fig. 1.4 ), and by country, from greater than 30% in seven low- and middle-income countries to less than 10% in seven countries (Australia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Sweden and Switzerland) (see Fig. 1.5a and Fig. 1.5b ). Over three quarters of deaths from cardiovascu- lar disease and diabetes, and nearly 90% of deaths from chronic respiratory diseases, occur in low- and middle-income countries. More than two thirds of all cancer deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (see Fig. 1.6 ) (6). Lung, breast, colorectal, stomach and liver cancers together cause more than half of cancer deaths.

In low- and middle-income countries, cancer levels vary according to the prevailing underlying risks, with cervical cancer, liver cancer and stom- ach cancer all causing a larger proportion of cancer deaths than in high-income countries. In sub-Sa- haran Africa, for instance, cervical cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death among women. Population growth and improved longevity are leading to increasing numbers and proportions of older people in many parts of the world. As pop- ulations age, annual NCD deaths are projected to rise substantially to 52 million in 2030 ( 3). Annual cardiovascular disease mortality is projected to increase from 17.5 million in 2012 to 22.2 million in 2030, and annual cancer deaths from 8.2 million to 12.6 million. Th ese increases will occur despite projected decreases in NCD death rates. Key barriers to attaining this target Key barriers to attaining this target include, the lack of a well-functioning civil/vital registration system for monitoring, weak health system infrastructure and inadequate funding for prevention and control of NCDs.

Results of the 2013 global survey on assessment of national capacity indicate that 19% of countries (n=178) do not have a system in place for reporting cause-specifi c mor- tality in their national health information systems (5). Across income groups, 98% of high-income and 92% of upper-middle-income countries reported having a system for reporting cause-specific Chapter 1. Global target 1 15mortality, while 70% of lower-middle-income countries and only 45% of low-income countries indicated such capacity. Across WHO regions, a system for generating cause-specifi c mortality was reported in all countries in the European Region. In all other regions, some of the countries did not have such a system. Seventy four per cent (74%) of countries indicated that cause of death was certifi ed by a medical practitioner. While 77% of countries indicated that hospital-based deaths were included in the reporting registration system, only 72% of countries reported that their registration system also included deaths occurring outside medical facilities. In all, 119 Member States (61%) have reported cause-of-death information to WHO since 2000, and only 97 Member States (50%) report their data regularly ( 8). Only 34 countries - representing 15% of the world's population - produce high-quality cause-of-death data, meaning that more than 90% of deaths are registered and fewer than 10% of deaths are coded to ill-defi ned signs and symptoms (9). As shown in Fig. 1.7 , civil registration coverage is less than 50% in many low- and middle-income countries.Status of health system infrastructure and funding for noncommunicable diseases According to the results of the 2013 NCD country capacity assessment survey, some 94% of 178 coun- tries had a unit, branch, division or department with responsibility for NCDs within the ministry of health or equivalent ( 5). In all, 80% of countries had at least one full-time staff member working on NCDs; thus, 14% of countries have a unit for NCDs in their health ministry but no full-time staff member dedicated to NCDs. Results showed that 84% of countries reported having funding available for early detection and screening for NCDs, while 89% of countries reported that funding was available for providing health care for NCDs, as well as for primary pre-vention and health promotion. Funding for sur- veillance, monitoring and evaluation was reported by a comparatively lower proportion of countries (74%), and was particularly low in the African Region (49%) and Eastern Mediterranean Region (48%) (see Fig. 1.8 ). Across all countries, only 74% reported having funding for capacity-building, and the availability of funding for rehabilitation services was also moderately low across all regions, with Fig. 1.8 Percentage of countries with funding for NCD activities, by function, 2013, by WHO region and by World Bank income group ( 5) Q Primary prevention & health promotion Q Early detection/screening Q Health care and treatment Q Surveillance, monitoring and evaluation Q Capacity-building Q Rehabilitation services 100% 80%60%40%20% 0%Percentage of countries with funding for NCD activities, by function (% of countries) AFR=African Region, AMR=Region of the Americas, SEAR =South-East A sia EUR=European Region, EMR=Eastern Mediterranean Re gion, WPR=Western Pacic RegionWPR SEAR AFR HIgh- middle- incomeLower- middle- incomeLow- incomeGlobal status report on NCDs 2014 16only 64% of countries surveyed having funding. Overall, 6% of countries (i.e. 10 countries) reported no funding stream for NCD activities. Th ere was a signifi cant lack of funding available for NCD activities in low-income countries (18% reported no funding) versus the lower-middle-income (7%) and upper-middle-income and high-income countries (2%). Major sources of funding included govern- ment revenues (90%), international donors (64%), health insurance (54%) and earmarked taxes on alcohol and tobacco (32%). Low-income countries reported receiving less funding for NCD activities from all sources: 66% of low-income countries received government rev- enues, compared to more than 90% of countries in other income groups. Similarly, although 28% of low-income countries received funds from health insurance, this still remains markedly lower than in countries in other income groups. Use of ear- marked taxes to fund NCD activities was reported by 32% of countries. A comparison of the 172 countries that responded to questions about funding in capacity assessment surveys, conducted in both 2010 ( 10) and 2013 ( 5), reveals an improvement since 2010. Th ere was an increase in the percentage of low-income countries receiving funds from international donors in 2013 (75%) relative to 2010, when the fi gure was 57%. Similarly, there was an increase in the percentage of countries that reported using earmarked taxes to fund NCD activities (20% in 2010 versus 32% in 2013). Th e percentage of countries using earmarked funds has increased across all regions except Africa. Various fi scal interventions could be used to raise funds for prevention and control of NCDs. Results of the 2013 NCD country capacity assessment sur- vey ( 5), show that there is room for improvement (see Fig 1.9 ). Only about one third of countries had fi scal interventions to raise funds for health. Taxes on tobacco and alcohol were reported by 85% and 76% of countries respectively. Only 11% of countries reported taxation on food with high sugar content, and non-alcoholic beverages, and only 3% reported taxation on high-fat foods. Only in 39% of coun- tries were such policies and interventions intended to raise general revenues. In 34% of countries, they were intended to infl uence health behaviour. In a few countries, fi scal interventions were intended to raise funds for health, and most of these (5 of the 11 coun- tries) were in the lower-middle-income grouping.

Global target 1 17Actions required to attain this target The \"25\u00d725\" target was based on analysis of trends in the indicator over recent decades. Th e experience of high-performing countries during 19802010 showed that very substantial declines in NCD death rates can be achieved and that the proposed target is achievable. Based on their past performance, high-income countries may wish to set a national target for reducing premature mor- tality that is higher than the global target. Coun- tries with good-quality cause-of-death data from a complete registration system may also wish to establish more detailed national targets for specifi c NCDs. All actions that are required to attain the other eight targets discussed in chapters 29 , will con- tribute to the attainment of this target on prema- ture mortality. Th e risk factor and mortality tar- gets were chosen independently from one another, largely based on experiences of countries that had been successful in reducing any one of the corre- sponding indicators ( 11). As policy attention and resources are mobilized towards NCD prevention and control, it is useful to know if selected risk factor targets discussed in subsequent chapters, if achieved, would contribute towards reducing NCD mortality, to achieve the \"25\u00d725\" target ( 12). A modelling analysis has been done to answer this important question ( 13). Th e results show that, achieving six targets (tobacco, harmful use of alcohol, salt, raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose and obesity) by 2025 together, will reduce premature mortality from the four main NCDs to levels that are close to the 25 x 25 target ( 22% in men and 19% in women). Th e multifaceted nature of the drivers, causes and determinants of NCDs requires implemen-tation of comprehensive multisectoral policies to reduce premature mortality from NCDs (see Chap- ter 10 ). Th e following 10 key actions will be critical in dismantling barriers and paving the way to attain this target:1. Obtain explicit high-level/head-of-state com- mitment, establish/strengthen the NCD unit in the ministry of health, and ensure that NCDs are accorded due consideration in national stra- tegic health planning. 2. Develop a national multisectoral plan, as out- lined in Chapter 10 , taking into account the WHO Global NCD Action Plan 20132020 ( 14) and regional frameworks and action plans. 3. Establish a high-level interministerial platform/ commission to facilitate and endorse multisec- toral collaboration for prevention and control of NCDs. 4. Set national NCD targets, consistent with the nine global targets, covering risk factors, national systems performance, and mortality, based on national situations. 5. Strengthen national surveillance systems for NCDs, including vital registration that is capa- ble of reporting cause of death, cancer registries, and risk factor surveillance, and ensure these are integrated into national health information systems, to enable regular reporting/auditing/ benchmarking and monitoring of progress. 6. Defi ne, fi nance, prioritize and take to scale the implementation of very cost-eff ective interven- tions (see Box 1.1 ). 7 . Strengthen the health system at all levels, with emphasis on primary care, and define and fi nance a national set of NCD interventions/ services for health promotion/prevention and curative, rehabilitative and palliative care, to achieve universal health coverage dynamically and incrementally. 8. Protect the implementation of public health policies for NCD prevention and control from interference by vested interests, through com- prehensive legislation and enforcement of national laws and regulations. 9. Strengthen training of the health workforce and the scientifi c basis for decision-making, through partnerships and NCD-related research. 10. Mobilize and track domestic and exter- nal resources for NCD prevention and Global status report on NCDs 201418control, including through innovative financing mechanisms. A range of policies will be required to strengthen the implementation capacity of countries to attain the voluntary global targets. They are summarized in the Global NCD Action Plan ( 14). A combination of population-wide and individual interventions need to be selected and implemented, based on the availability of resources ( 14-16 ). The selection should be guided by impact, feasibility of implemen - tation, cost-effectiveness and affordability. Com - plementing population-wide interventions with i ndividual interventions is essential, since high- risk individuals will not be adequately protected by the population-level interventions. Although Box 1.1 WHO \"best buys\" - (very cost-effective interventions that are also high-impact and feasible for implementation even in resource-constrained settings) (14-16) Tobacco Reduce affordability of tobacco products by increasing tobacco excise taxes Create by law completely smoke-free environments in all indoor workplaces, public places and public transport Warn people of the dangers of tobacco and tobacco smoke through effective health warnings and mass media campaigns Ban all forms of tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship Harmful use of alcohol Regulate commercial and public availability of alcohol Restrict or ban alcohol advertising and promotions Use pricing policies such as excise tax increases on alcoholic beverages Diet and physical activity Reduce salt intake Replace trans fats with unsaturated fats Implement public awareness programmes on diet and physical activity Promote and protect breastfeeding Cardiovascular disease and diabetes Drug therapy (including glycaemic control for diabetes mellitus and control of hypertension using a total risk approach) and counselling to individuals who have had a heart attack or stroke and to persons with high risk ( 30%) of a fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular event in the next 10 years Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) for acute myocardial infarction Cancer Prevention of liver cancer through hepatitis B immunization Prevention of cervical cancer through screening (visual inspection with acetic acid [VIA] linked with timely treatment of pre-cancerous lesions) individual interventions can have relatively high costs compared to population-wide interventions, the investment in at least the limited set of \"best buys\" that are recommended in this report can yield a good return. The average annual cost of implementing the very cost-effective interventions (\"best buys\", see Box 1.1 ) is estimated be US$ 11.2 billion ( 15). On the other hand, the cumulative economic losses due to NCDs in low- and middle-income countries between 20112025 under a \"business as usual\" scenario have been estimated to be a staggering 7 trillion ( 17). The cost of taking action amounts to an annual investment of under US$ 1 per capita in low-income countries, US$ 1.50 per capita in Chapter 1. Global target 1 19lower-middle-income countries and US$ 3 per cap- ita in upper-middle-income countries. Expressed as a proportion of current health spending, the cost of implementing such a package amounts to 4% in low-income countries, 2% in lower-middle-income countries and less than 1% in upper-middle-income countries ( 15). In all countries, an increase in investment in NCD prevention and control will be necessary to attain this target. Strengthening surveillance sys- tems, including vital registration, plus multisectoral engagement, population-wide prevention policies, proactive case-fi nding, and strengthening of health systems with a special focus on primary health care are important goals for all countries. Countries with good economic growth, sound governance, strong NCD policies and health institutions, could achieve the \"25\u00d725\" target, by scaling up their expenditures on cost-eff ective programmes in proportion to cur- rent allocations. All resource-constrained settings could give priority to targeting additional govern- ment spending on very cost-eff ective high-impact interventions ( 14,15 ). Low- and middle-income countries that spend less than what they can afford on health need to explore means of mobilizing more domestic resources for health from general revenues and social insurance contributions ( 18). In low-income countries, simply increasing health spending along the lines of past expenditure patterns may not be adequate, because the amounts required to address NCDs, in addition to other health priorities such as communicable diseases and maternal and child health, may be beyond any realistic expectation of the fi nancial resources these countries will be able to generate. Development agencies and inter- national partners have a distinct role to play in supporting these countries.Global status report on NCDs 2014 20References 1. World Health Organization.

Global target 1 21 Th ere is a causal relationship between harmful use of alcohol and the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular diseases, cancers and liver diseases. In 2012, an estimated 3.3 million deaths, or 5.9 % of all deaths worldwide, were attributable to alcohol consumption. More than half of these deaths resulted from NCDs. Implementing very cost-eff ective population-based policy options - such as the use of taxation to regulate demand for alcoholic beverages, restriction of availability of alcoholic beverages, and bans or comprehensive restrictions on alcohol advertising - are key to reducing the harmful use of alcohol and attaining this target. Health professionals have an important role to play in reducing the harmful use of alcohol, by identifying hazardous and harmful drinking or alcohol dependence in their patients and by providing brief interventions and treatment as appropriate.Key points23Harmful use of alcohol and its impact on health Harmful use of alcohol is associated with a risk of developing noncommunicable diseases, mental and behavioural disorders, including alcohol dependence, as well as unintentional and intentional injuries, including those due to road traffi c accidents and violence. Th ere is also a causal relationship between harmful use of alcohol and incidence of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. Alcohol consumption by an expectant mother may cause fetal alcohol syndrome and pre-term birth complications. In 2012 it was estimated that 3.3 million deaths, or 5.9% of all deaths world- wide, were attributable to alcohol consumption. More than half of these deaths resulted from NCDs - chiefl y cardiovascular diseases and diabetes (33.4%), cancers (12.5%) and gastrointestinal diseases, including liver cirrhosis (16.2%). An estimated 5.1% of the global burden of disease -as measured in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) - is attributed to alcohol consumption. Cardiovascular diseases, cancers and gastrointestinal diseases (largely due to liver cirrhosis) are responsible for more than one third (37.7%) of this burden ( 1).2Global target 2: At least 10% relative reduction in the harmful use of alcohol, as appropriate, within the national context Fig. 2.1 Total (recorded and unrecorded) alcohol consumption per capita (aged 15 years and over), in litres of pure alcohol within a calendar year, by WHO region, projected estimates for 2012 Alcohol per capita consumption (litres per year*) * Recorded and unrecorded litres of pure alcohol per year<2.5 2.5-4.95-9.910 Data not availableNot applicableWHO 2014, All rights reserved.

At high levels, alcohol consumption is associated with exponentially increasing risk of liver cirrhosis and pancreatitis ( 3,4). Th e relationship between alcohol consumption and ischaemic heart and cerebrovascular diseases is complex. Alcohol use is associated with the risk of hypertensive disease, atrial fi brillation and haem- orrhagic stroke, yet, on the other hand, lower levels, Fig. 2.3 Total alcohol consumption per capita, 2010 (in litres of pure alcohol) in the total population aged 15 years and over by WHO region and World Bank income groups 12 10 86420Litres of pure alcohol per capita AFR=African Region, AMR=Region of the Americas, SEAR =South-East A sia EUR EMR AMR AFRand particular patterns, of alcohol consumption in some populations may lower the risk of ischaemic heart disease and ischaemic stroke and associated mortality. However, controversy remains on the potential benefi cial eff ect of low alcohol intake on cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, benefi cial eff ects of lower levels of alcohol consumption, if any, tend to disappear if the patterns of drinking are characterized by heavy episodic drinking ( 5), which is highly prevalent in many countries and population groups ( 1,6).

Although alcohol consumption is deeply embedded in the cultures of many societies, WHO estimates for 2010 showed that 48% of the global adult population had never consumed alcoholic beverages and 62% of the pop- ulation aged 15 years and older had not consumed alcohol during the previous 12 months. Th e high- est levels of alcohol consumption were found in middle- and high-income countries of the WHO European Region and the Region of the Americas (see Fig. 2.1 ), while the lowest levels were observed in the Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia Regions (see Table 2.1 ). Projected estimates of total (recorded and unrecorded) alcohol consumption per capita (aged 15 years and over) for 2012, by country is shown in Fig 2.2 . Th ere is a wide varia- tion in total alcohol consumption between diff erent countries. Prevalence of heavy episodic drinking in past 30 days, is shown in Fig. 2.4 . Th e prevalence of heavy episodic drinking is associated with the overall levels of alcohol consumption and is high- est in the European Region and the Region of the Americas (see Table 2.2, Fig. 2.3 ) (1). In general, the greater the economic wealth of a country, the more alcohol is consumed and the smaller the number of abstainers is (see Table 2.2 ).

WHO's Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol highlights 10 policy areas for multisectoral national action to protect the health of populations and reduce the alcohol-attributable disease burden (7). Th ey include: leadership, awareness and commitment; health services response; community action; drink-driving policies and countermeasures; availability of alcohol; marketing of alcoholic beverages; pricing policies; reducing the negative consequences of drink-driving and alcohol intoxication; reducing the public health impact of illicit alco- hol and informally-produced alcohol; monitoring and surveillance. Th ese areas for action are also outlined in the Global NCD Action Plan ( 8). Some interventions for reducing harmful use of alcohol are very cost-eff ective, or \"best buys\" (see Box 1.1 ). When implemented in health services, individual actions such as screening and brief interventions for hazardous and harmful drink- ing, and treatment of alcohol dependence, are also eff ective in reducing the harmful use of alcohol. Such interventions have a good cost-eff ectiveness profi le, although their implementation requires more resources than those for population-based measures ( 6,912 ). Health professionals play an important role in reducing the harmful use of alcohol, by assessing and monitoring levels and patterns of alcohol consumption in patients and by intervening with brief interventions, counselling and pharmacotherapy - as appropriate - in cases where hazardous and harmful drinking or alcohol dependence are identifi ed ( 8,13,14 ).Monitoring harmful use of alcohol The three indicators of the global monitoring framework (see Annex 1 ), for monitoring progress towards attaining this target are: total (recorded and unrecorded) alcohol con- sumption per capita (aged 15 years and over) within a calendar year, in litres of pure alcohol, as appropriate within the national context; age-standardized prevalence of heavy episodic drinking among adolescents and adults, as appro- priate within the national context; heavy episodic drinking among adults is defi ned as consumption of at least 60 g or more of pure alcohol on at least one occasion in the previous 30 days; alcohol-related morbidity and mortality among adolescents and adults, as appropriate within the national context. Member States may choose to report against the indicator most appropriate to their national circumstances, or against all three indicators if possible. However, total per capita consumption is one of the most reliable indicators of alcohol expo-sure and is recommended for monitoring progress in reducing the harmful use of alcohol at popu-lation level. Eff ective monitoring of trends in the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking requires a well-developed system for surveillance of alcohol consumption in populations. Shortcomings seen in a number of surveys - such as poor representation of the whole population, under-representation of heavy drinkers in survey samples, use of diff erent indicators and data-collection instruments, and underreporting of alcohol consumption, partic-ularly in societies with stigmatization and social disapproval of drinking - must be minimized. Th ere are signifi cant challenges in measuring and reporting alcohol-related morbidity and mortality, since reporting on these indicators is signifi cantly infl uenced by the organization and functioning of the health system. Nevertheless, these indicators can be used for monitoring purposes in well-devel- oped and relatively stable health systems.Chapter 2. Global target 2 29Progress achieved Since the Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol (7) was endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2010, growing numbers of countries have developed or reformulated their national alco- hol policies and action plans. Of 76 countries with a written national policy on alcohol, 52 have taken steps to operationalize it ( 15). Higher minimum legal drinking ages, controls over alcohol sales, fewer out- lets (including reduced density of outlets), and limited hours and days of sale reduce both alcohol sales and consumption ( 16). Some 160 WHO Member States have regulations on age limits for sale of alcoholic beverages, with 18 years as the most frequent age limit for all beverage types and 2021 years in some countries (e.g. Iceland, Indonesia, Japan, Sweden, the United States of America (USA) ( 1). A total ban on advertising alcoholic beverages has been considered by the Government of South Africa, as a necessary measure to reduce the burden attributable to alcohol. Eff orts of the Government of the Russian Federation to curb the high level of alcohol consumption include strengthening regu- lations on availability and marketing of alcoholic beverages, including beer; enforcing drink-driving measures; and increasing the minimum retail price for the most common spirit. A new alcohol strategy introduced in the United Kingdom of Great Britain Box 2.1 Mongolia: working with civil society to reduce harmful use of alcohol Mongolia's revised law on alcohol prevention and control in- cludes essential strategies for reducing alcohol-related harm - such as a total ban on alcohol advertising, legislation on the population-density requirement for alcohol sales outlets, in-creased liability of businesses selling alcohol, and strengthe-ned administrative and deterrence systems for infringements and violations. The law aims to bridge the gaps between re-gulation and implementation that were observed in the past and to improve coordination of alcohol-related strategies and programmes, by strengthening cooperation between di erent levels of government and other stakeholders. Mongolia set up a national network of 80 governmental and nongovernmental organizations, to increase public awareness, formulate policies and establish a legal environment to reduce the consequences of alcohol use and strengthen implementation of the law. Sources: see references ( 17). and Northern Ireland (UK) in 2012 promotes coor- dinated actions across diff erent government sectors and prioritizes measures with proven eff ectiveness in reducing alcohol-related harm. Mongolia has established a national network to strengthen the legal environment for prevention and control of alcohol (see Box 2.1 ) (1). Actions required to attain this target Evidence on the eff ectiveness and cost-eff ective- ness of policy options to reduce the harmful use of alcohol strongly indicates that countries should prioritize, according to their national contexts, the following action areas: pricing policies; availability of alcohol; marketing of alcoholic beverages; the response of health services; drink-driving policies and countermeasures. Th e successful implementation by governments of population-based interventions to reduce harmful use of alcohol depends on sustained political com- mitment and societal support. Eff ective communica- tion measures are needed to support alcohol-control measures that may restrict individuals' choices and Global status report on NCDs 2014 30reduce the economic benefi ts for enterprises involved in alcohol production and sale ( 47). Labelling on alcoholic drinks may help consum- ers to estimate their alcohol content and potentially choose a drink with less alcohol. Nevertheless, a study in Australia supports the view that standard labelling of drinks, without other changes to packag- ing and marketing, may serve to help young people choose the strongest drink for the lowest cost ( 18). Health warnings have been introduced to inform consumers about the risks associated with drinking alcohol and to stimulate reduced con- sumption. However, international experience shows that health warnings that are poorly visible or have generic messages have a weak impact on drinking behaviour ( 19). More recent studies recommend direct, more visible and pictorial health warnings, with due consideration of plain packaging for alco- hol products, in order to infl uence recall, percep- tions and behaviours ( 20). Models of a range of fi scal policy scenarios from a number of countries have indicated the high cost eff ectiveness of taxation and pricing policies in reduc- ing hazardous drinking and alcohol-attributable mortality, as well as in raising revenue ( 6,9,21,22 ). Setting a minimum price per unit for alcohol in retail sales can complement taxation measures and result in health benefi ts, as demonstrated in a statistical model for England ( 21), and as supported by the impact on alcohol consumption in one province of Canada ( 22). A total of 154 WHO Member States have some form of excise tax on beer, wine or spirits, but the eff ectiveness of these measures in protecting population health depends on their scale and their impact on the demand for alcoholic beverages. Drink-driving measures, such as random breath-testing and setting and enforcing low limits (0.020.05%) for blood-alcohol concentration are eff ective in reducing not only road traffi c injuries but also alcohol consumption by drivers. Th us, these measures have potential to improve popula- tion health outcomes associated with NCDs.References 1. Global status report on alcohol and health 2014.

Regular physical activity - at least 150 minutes of moderate- intensity physical activity per week for adults - reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and all-cause mortality. Children and young people aged 517 years should accumulate at least 60 minutes of physical activity of moderate to vigorous intensity daily, in order to maintain and improve lung and heart condition, muscular fi tness, bone health, cardiovascular and metabolic health biomarkers and mental health. Globally, in 2010, 20% of adult men and 27% of adult women did not meet WHO recommendations on physical activity for health. Amongst adolescents, aged 1117 years, 78% of boys and 84% of girls did not meet these recommendations. Under the leadership of the health ministries, strategies to improve physical activity should be developed and implemented through multiple sectors, in order to create an enabling environment for active living. Supportive built environment, multicomponent programs including mass media campaigns and use of settings are key to achieving this target. Th e attainment of this target will contribute to attainment of targets on reducing the prevalence of hypertension, on a 0% increase in diabetes and obesity and, ultimately, on reducing premature mortality from NCDs.Key points33Insu cient physical activity and its impact on health Insuffi cient physical activity is one of the 10 leading risk factors for global mortality, causing some 3.2 million deaths each year ( 1). In 2010, insuffi cient physical activity caused 69.3 million DALYs - 2.8% of the total - globally ( 1). Adults who are insuffi ciently physically active have a 2030% increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to those who do at least 150 minutes of moder- ate-intensity physical activity per week, or equivalent, as recommended by WHO (2). Regular physical activity reduces the risk of ischaemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes and breast and colon cancer. Additionally, regular physical activity is a key determinant of energy expenditure and is therefore fundamental to energy balance, weight control and prevention of obesity ( 2). Th e prevalence of insuffi cient physical activity in men and women aged 18 years and over in diff erent parts of the world is shown in Figs. 3.1 and 3.2 respectively. 3Global target 3: A 10% relative reduction in prevalence of insufficient physical activity Fig. 3.1 Age standardized prevalence of insu cient physical activity in men aged 18 years and over, comparable estimates, 2010 Prevalence of insucient physical activity (%)* * Less than 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, or equivalent<20 20-29.930-39.9 40-49.950 Data not availableNot applicableThe designations employed and the presentation of the material in this publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the World Health Organization concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

Overall, older people were less active than younger people: 19% of the youngest age group did not meet the recommended level, compared to 55% of the oldest age group. However, young women were slightly less active than middle-aged women. Th e WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (31%) and Region of the Americas (32%) had the highest prevalence of insuffi cient physical activity, while the prevalence was lowest in the South-East Asia (15%) and African (21%) Regions. Across all regions, women were less active than men, with diff erences in prevalence between men and women of 10% and greater in the Eastern Mediterranean Region and the Region of the Americas (see Fig. 3.3 ). 1.

Th e prevalence in high-income countries (33%) was about double that in low-income coun- tries (17%). Nearly 28% of women from upper-mid- dle-income countries and 38% in high-income countries did not reach WHO's recommended level of physical activity. Th e higher levels of activity in low-income and lower-middle-income countries may be explained by high levels of occupational and transport activity in these countries ( 4). In addition to rising income levels, factors such as increased ownership and use of vehicles, diff erent occupation types, urbanization and industrialization seem to be important determi- nants of levels and patterns of physical activity ( 5,6). Insu cient physical activity among adolescents Compared to their inactive peers, children and adolescents doing at least 60 minutes of physical activity of moderate to vigorous intensity daily have higher levels of cardiorespiratory fi tness, muscular endurance and strength.

Levels of insuffi cient physical activity were highest in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the African Region and the Western Pacifi c Region (88%, 85% and 85% respectively). Adolescent girls were less active than adolescent boys in all WHO regions (see Fig. 3.7 ). Th ere was no clear pattern of insuffi cient physical activity among adolescents across income groups; the prevalence was highest in upper-middle-income countries and lowest in lower-middle-income coun- tries (see Fig. 3.7 ). What are the cost-e ective policies and interventions for reducing insu c i e n t physical activity? Evidence shows that many eff ective interventions - focusing on policy and environment, mass media, school settings, workplaces, the community and primary health care - can be implemented by pol- icy-makers to increase people's physical activity ( 7). Across these categories, multicomponent interven- tions adapted to local cultural and environmen- tal contexts are the most successful (see Box 3.1 ). Interventions that use the existing social structures and participation of all stakeholders reduce barriers to implementation. The physical or built environment plays an important role in facilitating physical activity for large portions of the population, by ensuring that walking, cycling and other forms of non-motor- ized transport are accessible and safe for all ( 8). Th e physical environment also provides sports, recreation and leisure facilities and ensures there are adequate safe spaces for active living, for both children and adults ( 9). Health messages on stairs promote physical activity, while the use of stairs decreases when no message is displayed. A recent study showed that individual preferences and/or the lack of eff ort required in using escalators or elevators may lead people to avoid using stairs as a physical activity ( 10). School-based physical activity interventions show consistent improvements in knowledge, atti- tudes and behaviour of children and, when tested, in physical and clinical outcomes ( 8). Workplaces may also reduce individual risk-related behaviours, including physical inactivity, with the potential to reach more than 3.6 billion economically active persons in 2020 ( 11).Chapter 3. Global target 3 39Monitoring insu c i e n t physical activity Th e global monitoring framework (see Annex 1 ), includes two indicators for monitoring insuffi cient physical activity ( 12): 1. Prevalence of insuffi cient physical activity in adolescents, defi ned as less than 60 minutes of physical activity of moderate to vigorous inten- sity daily; 2. age-standardized prevalence of insufficient physical activity in persons aged 18 years and over, defi ned as NOT meeting any of the fol- lowing criteria: 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week; 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week; an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity, accumu- lating at least 600 MET-minutes 1 per week. 1. MET refers to metabolic equivalent. It is the ratio of a person's working metabolic rate relative to the resting metabolic rate. One MET is defi ned as the energy cost of sitting quietly, and is equivalent to a caloric consumption of 1 kcal per kg per hour. Figure 3.7 Age-standardized prevalence of insu cient physical activity in school going adolescent boys and girls (11-17 years), by WHO region and World Bank income group, comparable estimates, 2010 Q Adolescent boys Q Adolescent girls 100% 80%60%40%20% 0%% of population AFR=African Region, AMR=Region of the Americas, SEAR =South-East A sia EMR AMR AFRProgress achieved WHO's NCD country capacity assessment survey of 2013 showed that, while 80% of countries reported having policies, plans or strategies for addressing physical inactivity, only 56% indicated that these were operational ( 13). Only a few countries (8%) reported using tax incentives to promote physical activity - including tax exemptions or rebates on sports equipment, fitness programmes or gym membership, and higher taxation on items such as home entertainment equipment that encourage sedentary lifestyles. As a result of implementation of national policies and programmes to improve physical activity, several high-income countries, including Canada and Fin-land, have reported increased physical activity over the last decade ( 14,15 ). In recent years more low- and middle-income countries have set up initiatives to address physical inactivity (see Boxes 3.13.3 ). Actions required to attain this target All ministries of health need to take leadership in, and responsibility for, implementing national NCD Global status report on NCDs 2014 40action plans consistent with the Global NCD Action Plan ( 16) and the Global strategy on diet, physical activity and health ( 17). Achieving the physical activity targets requires multisectoral collabo-ration and partnership. It is critical to develop a costed national physical activity plan and convene a national physical activity committee or task force with high-level support and resources and with representation from multiple sectors, agencies, NGOs and the private sector to provide leadership and guidance in implementing the plan. A comprehensive set of policy options to improve physical activity is listed in the Global NCD Action Plan ( 16). In 2010 WHO developed global recom- mendations on physical activity for health ( 2). Coun- tries are urged to adapt these recommendations to Box 3.1 Walkability is positively associated with physical activity: Curitiba, Brazil In Curitiba, Brazil, adults living in high-walk- ability areas were found to be more likely to achieve recommended levels of physical acti-vity, both for transport walking and leisure-time physical activity. The proportion of those who walk for transport for 150 minutes per week was 21.1% in low-walkability areas, and ranged from 33.5% to 35.0% in high-walkability areas. A total of 12.6% of residents were found to walk for leisure for 150 minutes per week. No re-lationship was found between walkability and income, indicating that walkability is associated with physical activity, regardless of neighbourhood income level. The results of the study con rm ndings from high-income countries that walkability plays an important r ole in physical activity as daily transport. Thus, policies that infl uence the built environment may promote population-level physical activity. Sources: see references ( 18). Box 3.2 Partnership and social marketing to promote physical activity in women: Tonga Women in Tonga are more sedentary and obese than men, owing to a range of cultural and socioeconomic factors - such as the fact that sporting activities are often designed for and dominated by men. Recognizing the seriousness of women's se-dentary behaviour, the Tongan ministry of health and Ministry of Internal A airs, with the support of the Australian Sports Outreach Program, joined with the Tonga Netball Association in a campaign that brought together a broad range of technical skills and networks to deliver a highly targeted intervention. Guided by the Tonga National Strategy to Prevent and Control Non-Communicable Diseases (2010-2015), the partners adopted a social marketing and community mobilization approach known as strategic health communication. This approach aimed to understand the perspective of the target audience and to promote physical activity as \"easy, exciting, enjoyable and everywhere\" . The campaign used netball as a means of encouraging sport, with bene ts to the sports sector. The campaign, branded Kau Mai Tonga: Netipol (Come on Tonga, let's play netball!), was launched in June 2012 and since then has been delivered in annual phases of community mobilization, large-scale advertising and communication, and interpersonal education. Since the rst phase, there has been increased participation of women, with more than 20 netball clubs registered, and increased knowledge and awareness of the bene ts of physical activity among participants. Sources: see references ( 19). Chapter 3. Global target 3 41the national context as tools for education, measure- ment, and policy decisions and interventions, while incorporating physical activity into surveillance sys- tems and setting national targets for change. Policy development should be encouraged at national and subnational levels, in cooperation with relevant sec-tors, to promote physical activity through activities of daily living. Urban planning and active transport policies can improve community walking and cycling opportunities, and education policies can mandate quality physical education and physical activity programmes throughout the school years.Sustainable transport policies provide oppor- tunities for active and non-motorized travel (see Box 3.4 ). Urban planning policy and built envi- ronment strategies, supported by efforts from parks and recreation authorities, create facilities and opportunities for people to be active. Crime prevention policies create safe environments, and new urban design creates walkable communities and environments that promote physical activity. Policies and programmes to create and pre- serve built and natural environments that support physical activity are best implemented through settings such as schools, universities, workplaces, Box 3.3 Bicycle hire to improve physical activity: Islamic Republic of Iran Tehran, the capital of the Islamic Republic of Iran, has intro- duced a bicycle-sharing scheme, funded by the municipal go-vernment. The scheme aims to reduce congestion on the city's streets, decrease pollution and provide additional transport. Twelve bicycle \"hubs\" are positioned across the city in various administrative districts, with each hub having around 40 bicy-cles. Over 6000 people have subscribed to the scheme, which allows the use of a bicycle for up to 4 h for the equivalent of US$ 2. For many, \"Bike House\" has made travel through the congested streets of Tehran fast and convenient. However, because of Isla- mic and cultural considerations, women are unable to participate in the programme. The city of Isfahan has deve-loped a similar scheme and the city-wide travel card includes the option of bicycle hire, along with use of the train, tram and buses. Sources: see references ( 20,21 ). Box 3.4 Sustainable transport: Freiburg, Germany There is growing evidence that dependence on automo- bile travel contributes to insu cient physical activity, trans- port-related carbon dioxide emissions, tra c congestion, air pollution and road tra c accidents. The city of Freiburg in southwestern Germany has been successful in implementing sustainable transport policies that may be transferable to car-oriented countries around the world. Over the last three de-cades, transport policies in Freiburg have encouraged more walking, cycling and use of public transport. During this pe-riod, the number of bicycle trips has tripled, travel by public transport has doubled, and the proportion of journeys by au-tomobile has declined from 38% to 32%. Since 1990, moto- rization rates have levelled o and per capita carbon dioxide emissions from transport have fallen, despite strong economic growth. Sources: see references ( 22,23 ).

Partners in the education sector can create physical activity programmes before, during and aft er school, and create supportive built environ- ments in schools. Th e sports sector can encourage regular structured activities, especially among chil- dren and adolescents, and can strengthen the link between physical activity, sports and health. Part-nerships with communities, the private sector and NGOs can also contribute to developing facilities for physical activity. Partnerships with workplaces and occupational settings can help develop healthy environments, promote physical activity at work and provide incentives and opportunities for active commuting to and from work. As part of the national programme, there is also a need to advocate for physical activity through political engagement, and to mobilize communities through social marketing and mass media cam- paigns - including education of the public on the benefi ts of physical activity (e.g. NCD prevention, less air pollution as a result of reduced traffi c, sus- tainable development). Evaluation and validation eff orts are required to promote best practices, monitor implementation and assess population reach.References 1.

Globally, 2010, 1.7 million annual deaths from cardiovascular causes have been attributed to excess salt/sodium intake. High salt consumption (more than 5 g per day) contributes to raised blood pressure and increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. Current estimates suggest that the global mean intake of salt is around 10 g of salt daily (4 g/day of sodium). WHO recommends reducing salt consumption to less than 5 g (about 1 teaspoon) per day in adults, to help prevent hypertension, heart disease and stroke. Reducing salt intake has been identifi ed as one of the most cost- eff ective measures for improving population health. Multisectoral collaboration is required to improve access to products with lower sodium content. Th e attainment of this target will contribute to the attainment of the targets on reducing the prevalence of raised blood pressure and, ultimately, on reducing premature mortality from NCDs.Key points45Salt/sodium intake and its impact on health Excess consumption of dietary sodium is associated with increased risk of hyper- tension and cardiovascular disease ( 14). It has been estimated that excess sodium intake was responsible for 1.7 million deaths from cardiovascular causes globally in 2010 ( 1). Th e main dietary source of sodium worldwide is salt. However, sodium can be found in other forms, and the main source of dietary sodium consumption depends on the cultural context and dietary habits of the population, but in many countries processed foods are the main source. Considerable evidence, including from clinical trials ( 58), shows that lowering sodium intake can reduce blood pressure.A meta-analysis of 36 studies found that decreased sodium intake resulted in a decrease in resting systolic blood pressure of 3.4 mmHg and a decrease in resting diastolic blood pressure of 1.5 mmHg (8). Sodium consumption is also associated with cardiovascular disease events in persons who consume more than 3.5 g/day of sodium ( 911 ). WHO recommends a reduction in salt intake to less than 5 g/day (sodium 2 g/ day) to reduce blood pressure and the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. For children, the recommended maximum level of intake of 2 g/day of sodium for adults should be adjusted downwards on the basis of the energy requirements of children relative to those of adults ( 12). Current estimates suggest that the global mean intake of salt is around 10 g of salt daily (4 g/day of sodium) ( 1). Measured data on mean population sodium intake are currently available mainly for high- and middle-income countries. However, additional fi gures on population intake of salt are becoming available through new population surveillance data, providing a broader picture of the extent of the problem. In many countries, most of the salt consumed comes from processed foods and ready-made meals, while salt added at the table or during food preparation at home is signifi cant in others. With increased processing in the food industry and greater availability of processed foods in both urban and rural areas of low- and middle-in-come countries, sources of sodium are shift ing rapidly towards these foods. Signifi cant regional variations exist (see Fig. 4.1 ). Intake levels appear highest in south-east and central Asia and parts of Europe. Th e WHO Region of the Americas, and European and Western Pacifi c Regions all show levels of consumption that greatly exceed WHO recommendations. Intakes appear lower in Africa but there is uncertainty about the estimates, since data for the WHO African Region are sparse 4Global target 4: A 30% relative reduction in mean population intake of salt/sodium Global status report on NCDs 2014 46and are based on food-consumption data rather than on more accurate measures of sodium excretion. Monitoring population intake of salt/sodium Th e indicator for monitoring this target is age-stan- dardized mean population intake of salt (sodium chloride) in grams per day in persons aged 18 years and over ( 13). Few countries have a baseline level of population salt/sodium intake, or knowledge of the most common sources of sodium in the diet.

For instance, in many countries, the popu- lation used for the NCD STEPS survey ( 14) is used to estimate data on salt consumption. Th e recom- mended standard for estimating salt intake is 24-h urine collection; however, other methods such as spot urine, single morning fasting urine and food frequency surveys have been used to obtain esti- mates at the population level. Th ere may be wide diff erences in sodium intake within countries, Box 4.1 Salt-smart Americas The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) initia- tive \"Cardiovascular disease prevention through popula-tion-wide dietary salt reduction\" supports countries of the Americas in reducing sodium intake, by providing e ective tools, strategies and inte rventions. These include evaluating population-based salt intake, raising awareness, promoting voluntary salt reduction, regulating salt use in manufactu-ring, improving food labelling, and promoting food science and health research. Since 2011, public health authorities in Argentina, Brazil and Chile in the south, and Canada, Mexico and the USA in the north have promoted voluntary national reformulation targets and timelines with the food industry. Most of these countries are targeting salt reduction in packaged foods and bread, while Mexico has focused on foods available in the school environment. Argentina has already achieved a 25% reduction in the salt content of bread. Keys to successful outcomes include voluntary salt reduction, education, health promotion, food labelling, regulation, ongoing monitoring, evalua-tion and reporting, research, and collaboration with the private sector. Sources: see references ( 18). Chapter 4. Global target 4 47Box 4.2 National campaign to reduce salt consumption in Thailand In 2011, The Ministry of Public Health of Thailand, along with other stakeholders, initiated a campaign aimed at reducing salt consumption by 50%. Academics and food producers jointly collaborate to undertake salt-reduction activities. Attention is mainly on foods for children, espe-cially snacks. The academic sector collaborated with the commercial sector to reformulate snack recipes. However, the reformulated products were not acceptable to the pu-blic and gradually disappeared from the market. Conse-quently, a more successful approach was initiated, whe- reby food producers were asked to reformulate their products themselves. This strategy resulted in many good market products, such as potato chips with sodium reduced by 50%, and instant noodles with sodium reduced by 20% (using potassium chloride). When instant noodles with reduced sodium become widely available, this should have a signi cant impact, since this product is consumed widely - more than 8 million packages a day are sold to people of all socioeconomic classes. Sources: see references ( 19). Box 4.3 A regulatory approach to reduce unhealthy food and beverages in the Paci c islands and Kiribati As a means of reducing the availability of products that are high in salt and fat, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services has decided to include maximum levels of sodium and fat in selected processed food items in the draft Food Regulations and Standards. The maxi-mum levels of salt and fat are derived from the \"Salt targets in Paci c Foods\" that were agreed and mandated by the meeting of Paci c Ministers of Health in 2013 and supported by WHO, to help address the NCD crisis in the Paci c. The draft Food Regulations and Stan- dards also include restrictions on marketing of food and non-alco-holic beverages to children, as well as restrictions on the promotion of breast-milk substitutes and baby-feeding accessories. Sources: see references ( 20). especially in emerging economies and in countries with rapidly increasing urbanization and peri-ur- ban populations. Progress achieved National eff orts to reduce population salt con- sumption are under way in many countries ( 15-17 ) (see Boxes 4.1-4.5 ). Following implementation of national strategies to reduce sodium in manufac- tured foods, both Finland and the UK have reported signifi cant reductions in sodium levels in manufac- tured foods, in population sodium intake, and in blood pressure, in both men and women ( 24-27 ). In Finland there is evidence of a 65% reduction in age-adjusted mortality from coronary heart disease over the last four decades. Changes in food manu- facturing and public health policies implemented at national level made an important contribution to these mortality reductions ( 24,25 ). Th ere is good evidence that regulatory policies to reduce specifi c nutrients in foods (e.g. salt, trans fatty acids, certain fats) are benefi cial, useful and eff ective in changing population dietary patterns (28). In some countries, mandatory regulation has resulted in changes to the food supply and dietary intake ( 24,25 ). Many countries have concluded vol- untary agreements with the food industry, through Global status report on NCDs 2014 48programmes such as Heart SAFE in New Zealand and the Korea Center for Less Salt campaign in the Republic of Korea, through national initiatives that involve states and local health authorities, or through obtaining signed pledges from the food industry ( 15). South Africa passed legislation for a phased reduction in salt in targeted processed foods items ( 21). Finland and the UK provide national examples of the impact of product reformulation policies. In the UK, voluntary measures and close collabora- tion between the public health and catering sectors have led to substantial improvements in the quality of processed foods and the diet of the population (24,25 ). Th ere is evidence that mandating the use of \"nutrition facts\" panels or front-of-pack labels/ icons can improve dietary patterns, by infl uencing the food industry to reformulate products to meet healthier labelling requirements ( 15).Implementing programmes and policies through settings such as schools, workplaces, villages and urban settings has shown an impact on behaviour. In Fiji, yearly renewal of licences for eating outlets are dependent on the outlets' commitment to, and implementation of, simple salt-reduction actions, such as removing salt-shakers and high-salt sauces from restaurant tables and providing them only on request. Actions required to attain this target Th e main sources of sodium in the diet need to be identifi ed, in order to develop an eff ective strategy and to set targets for implementation - including reformulation of processed foods and out-of-home meals. Th is information is also needed to track changes in population salt intake and to help target specifi c population groups.Box 4.4 Working with the private sector to reduce salt consumption in Argentina and South Africa The majority of WHO Member States have opted for setting volunta- ry targets for salt reformulation. However, others, including Argentina and South Africa, have opted for legislative regulation to set speci c targets for various food groups. Both methods of adopting targets in-volve dialogue with the private sector to facilitate reformulation, and also require consumer awareness to enable informed consumers to make the full use of the enabling environment. Sources: see references ( 22). Box 4.5 Salt-reduction campaigns in Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar The ministry of health of Kuwait established a national salt-reduc- tion programme in January 2013. The Salt and Fat Intake Reduction task force developed and implemented a national strategy to re-duce salt consumption, in consultation with nutrition experts and scientists and o cials from Kuwait's Food Standards O ce, and in collaboration with the food industry. By the end of 2013, one of the food companies had reduced the salt content of bread - including white pitta bread, burger buns and whole-wheat toast - by 20%. Kuwait is exploring ways of reducing the salt content of another commonly consumed food item - cheese. The Qatar government is working with one of the country's major bakeries to reduce the use of salt by 20%, and Bahrain is setting up a similar campaign. Sources: see references ( 23). Chapter 4. Global target 4 49Multisectoral collaboration is required to improve access to products with lower sodium. Th e ministry of health needs to take the lead in estab- lishing platforms for intersectoral collaboration and targets for reformulation of processed foods (both local and imported), as well as to develop national food-labelling regulations in line with the Codex Alimentarius ( 29). Food manufacturers need to work with the ministry of health to implement reformulation and labelling regulations. Caterers need to be involved in reducing the amount of salt added during the preparation of meals. Country-specifi c public-awareness and com- munity-mobilization campaigns on salt intake, as well as measures directed towards consumers and caterers, need to be developed and implemented, to increase awareness of sodium in foods and its impact on health. Health-care professionals may need training to convey the right messages and ensure eff ective communication. In addition, train- ing of food producers, manufacturers and caterers - especially those involved in small and medi- um-sized businesses - is important for creating enabling environments to ensure that reformulation targets are reached and that consumer-awareness campaigns are successful. In countries where salt added at the table or during food preparation is the main source of sodium in the diet, the use of salt substitutes may also be advocated and promoted (6,7,30 ). K e y m e a s u r e s t o r e d u c e s a l t c o n s u m p t i o n include ( 3,4,31 ): identifying the baseline level of population sodium/salt intake and the main foods contrib- uting to this level; setting a national target for sodium/salt intake, in line with the global target, as part of a national multisectoral salt-reduction plan; establishing sodium-reduction targets for each category of food, prioritizing the ones that con- tribute most to population intake; working with food manufacturers to progres- sively reduce sodium/salt incrementally in their products, in line with agreed food group targets; working with restaurants and catering ser- vices to reduce the addition of salt during meal preparation; establishing, in line with the Codex Alimenta- rius (30), consumer-friendly nutrition-labelling regulations that include sodium; considering fi scal tools to encourage the pro- duction and consumption of foods with reduced sodium content; establishing policies for food procurement in public institutions that encourage the purchase of products with lower sodium content; establishing national food-based dietary guide- lines that incorporate sodium reduction; implementing information campaigns to raise consumer awareness of the need to reduce salt intake, and social marketing to impact on con- sumers' behaviour; creating an enabling environment for salt reduc- tion through local policy interventions and pro- motion of \"healthy food\" settings such as schools, workplaces, communities and cities; monitoring population sodium intake, sodium content of manufactured products, sources of sodium/salt in the diet, and consumer knowl-edge, attitudes and behaviours relating to the consumption of products containing sodium/ salt, in order to inform policy decisions.Global status report on NCDs 2014 50References 1.

Tobacco use remains the cause of 6 million preventable deaths per year globally. Signifi cant progress has been made in implementing the most cost eff ective tobacco-control measures but much still remains to be done. Th e WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control provides the roadmap to curb the tobacco epidemic. Tobacco-control eff orts must be sustained and reinforced, to have any lasting impact on reducing tobacco prevalence. However, there appears to be some complacency that, coupled with insuffi cient political will and tobacco industry interference, is hindering eff orts to move ahead. Th e attainment of this target will contribute to attainment of the target on reducing premature mortality from NCDs.Key points53Tobacco use and its impact on health Tobacco use is currently one of the leading causes of preventable deaths in the world. Risks to health result not only from direct consumption of tobacco but also from exposure to second-hand smoke. Tobacco use increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes and premature death. Six million people are currently estimated to die annually from tobacco use, with over 600 000 deaths due to exposure to second-hand smoke (with 170 000 of these deaths among children) ( 1,2). Tobacco use accounts for 7% of all female and 12% of all male deaths globally ( 2,3). Unless strong action continues to be taken by countries, the annual toll is projected to increase to 8 million deaths per year by 2030, or 10% of all deaths projected to occur that year ( 2). As an entirely avoidable death toll, these fi gures are unacceptable. Tobacco use also imposes an economic burden in the form of increased medical costs and from lost productivity. In most economies, the health cost burden from tobacco also exceeds the total tax revenue(s) collected by the governments from tobacco products. Tobacco use is defi ned as current use of any tobacco product in either smoked or smokeless form ( 4). Availability and quality of data on smokeless tobacco use are slowly improving but are insuffi cient to report globally. Further improvements are needed, especially in the monitoring of use of smokeless tobacco as well as of the novel and emerging tobacco products. Th erefore information provided in this report refers primarily to current tobacco smoking among males and females aged 15 years and over. In 2012 there were some 1.1 billion smokers worldwide, with over 8 out of 10 tobacco smokers smoking daily. Manufactured cigarettes, the most common form of smoked tobacco, are used by over 90% of current smokers. In addition, tobacco is smoked in cigars, pipes and other forms, particularly hookahs and bidis in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Data on these specifi c forms of smoked tobacco are not yet readily available globally. In some countries the consumption of smokeless tobacco is as high, or higher than smoked forms of tobacco. Th e age-standardized prevalence of current tobacco smoking in persons aged 15 years and over, by WHO region and World Bank income group, in 2012, is shown in Fig. 5.1 . In 2012, the global prevalence of current tobacco smoking among adults was estimated at around 22%, with smoking rates varying widely across 5Global target 5: A 30% relative reduction in prevalence of current tobacco use in persons aged 15+ years Global status report on NCDs 2014 54the six WHO regions (see Fig. 5.1 ). Th e highest regional average rate for tobacco smoking in 2012 was 30% (in the WHO European Region) while the lowest rate was 12% in the African Region, although it is increasing rapidly. Globally smoking prevalence is about fi ve times higher among men (37%) than among women (7%) (see Fig. 5.2 and Fig. 5.3 ). Smoking prevalence in both high-income and upper-middle-income countries is broadly similar, although slightly higher in high income countries at 25% and middle-income countries at 22%. Among low-income countries, the average prevalence is lower (18%) (see Fig. 5.4 ) and, while various forms of tobacco consumption are popular, cigarette smoking accounts for about 80% of all forms of current smoking. In order to reduce the health threat of tobacco, the global target is a 30% relative reduction in prevalence of current tobacco use in persons aged 15 years and over by 2025 ( using 20 1 0 as base-line). Most governments have already engaged in strengthening their tobacco control measures, leading to the accelerated implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) which would enable them to reach this target.Fig. 5.1 Age-standardized prevalence of current tobacco smoking in persons aged 15 years and over, by WHO region and World Bank income group, comparable estimates, 2012 Q Males Q Females 50% 40%30%20%10% 0%% of population AFR=African Region, AMR=Region of the Americas, SEAR =South-East A sia incomeLow- EMR AMR AFR What are the cost-e ective policies and interventions for reducing tobacco use? Th e WHO FCTC ( 5) and its guidelines ( 6) repre- sent the global instrument that enables its Parties to attain the tobacco reduction target ( 4). In fact, during its sixth session in October 2014, the Con- ference of the Parties to the WHO FCTC called on Parties ( 7) to set national targets for 2025 for relative reduction of current tobacco use in per- sons aged 15 years and over, taking into account the global target. It also called on Parties to develop or strengthen national multisectoral policies and plans to achieve national targets on reduction of current tobacco use by 2025, taking into account WHO's Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013-2020 ( 8). A comprehensive set of policy options for tobacco control is listed in the global NCD action plan (8), including the most cost-eff ective interventions (\"best buys\") for tobacco control (Box 1.1) (9). Evidence shows that the very cost-eff ective WHO FCTC reduc- tion measures for reducing national tobacco use are: reducing the aff ordability of tobacco products by increasing tobacco excise taxes;Chapter 5.

Full implementation involves adopting other demand reduction measures such as helping tobacco users to quit and regulating tobacco products.

Cessation support and medication increase the likelihood that a smoker will quit successfully, and countries can establish programmes providing low-cost eff ective interven- tions for tobacco users to stop. Full implementation of the WHO FCTC also entails supply reduction measures such as combating illicit trade, provid- ing alternative livelihoods to tobacco farmers, and banning the sale or provision of tobacco products by and to minors. Full implementation involves two further important measures: countering tobacco industry interference, and establishing or reinforc- ing a national multisectoral and interministerial coordinating mechanism for the implementation of the WHO FCTC in each country. Monitoring tobacco use Th e global monitoring framework indicators (see Annex 1 ), for monitoring progress towards attain- ing this target are ( 4): 1. prevalence of current tobacco use among adolescents; 2. age-standardized prevalence of current tobacco use among persons aged 18+ years.Progress achieved Signifi cant progress has been made in global tobacco control in recent years. While much remains to be done, the successes show that it is possible to turn the tide of tobacco usage when strong national political will and public engagement urge the imple- mentation of eff ective policies. Success: one third of the world's people is protected by at least one of the most cost e ective tobacco-control measure Th e WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic, 2011 (10) indicated that, in 2010, 70 countries had already implemented at least one of the four tobac- co-control \"best-buy\" interventions at the highest level of achievement. By 2013, 95 countries had at least one \"best-buy\" measure in place at the highest level of achievement, and between 2010 and 2013 a total of 40 countries implemented for the fi rst time one or more \"best-buy\" measures at the highest level. In 2010, no country had all four \"best buys\" implemented, yet by 2013 two countries - Turkey (see Box 5.1 ) and Madagascar - had all four \"best buys\" in place at the highest level of achievement, and a further six countries had implemented three Box 5.1 Reducing tobacco demand in Turkey Turkey was the rst country to attain the highest level of co- verage in all of the WHO \"best-buy\" demand-reduction mea-sures for reducing tobacco prevalence. In 2012, the country increased the size of health-warning labels to cover 65% of the total surface area of each tobacco or cigarette packet. To-bacco taxes cover 80% of the total retail price, and there is currently a total ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship nationwide. The result of these concerted ef-forts has been a signi cant decrease (13.4% relative decline) in the smoking rates of a country that has a long tradition of tobacco use and high smoking prevalence. This progress is a sign of the Turkish government's sustained political commitment to tobacco control, exemplifying collaboration between government, WHO and other international health organizations, and civil society. Sources: see references ( 11). Chapter 5. Global target 5 59out of four \"best buys\" at the highest level. Many of the countries making progress in implementing \"best-buy\" measures were low- or middle-income countries, showing that cost is not the main barrier to tobacco reduction. However: some tobacco-control measures have become more established than others Although many countries have made a great deal of progress since 2010 in both introducing and imple- menting eff ective tobacco-control measures, some still have made little to no headway in fi ghting the tobacco epidemic. Additionally, some \"best-buy\" demand-reduction measures remain more widely implemented than others.Protecting people from the harms of tobacco smoke In 2013, 46 countries (including 35 low- and mid- dle-income counties) had complete smoking bans in indoor working places, public transportation and indoor public places. Sixteen countries have adopted comprehensive smoke-free legislation since 2010. Conversely, the number of countries with very weak or no smoke-free laws fell from 92 to 74 between 2010 and 2013, although the improvement does not necessarily mean that they are implement- ing at the highest level of achievement. A new trend is visible as countries increasingly extend their smoke-free policies to cover outdoor settings such as beaches, public parks, outdoor cafes and mar- kets, and even some streets, as well as settings that Box 5.2 Standardized packaging in Australia Australian o cials announced in July 2014 that the nation's daily smoking rate among people aged 14 years and over had declined from 15.1% to 12.8% between 2010 and 2013. The drop in the smoking rate shows that the standardized packaging law enforced at the end of 2012 - as well as the 25% tax increase instituted in 2010 - works. Australian law requires tobacco products to be sold in drab packages with large graphic images of tobacco-related di-seases. Inclusion of the brand name is allowed but without logos. Sources: see references ( 12). Box 5.3 Graphic health warnings in Thailand In June 2014, the Supreme Administrative Court of Thai- land allowed the implementation of a new regulation re-quiring packs of cigarettes sold in the country to display graphic health-warning labels covering 85% of both sides of the packets. This is a major step towards implementing this measure, which was signed by the ministry of health in March 2013, but it has come under re from the tobac-co industry and lobbyists. The implementation, originally planned for October 2013, was delayed by a court's decision to suspend implementation of the new warnings until the legal process was over; however, in June 2014 the Supreme Administrative Court ruled against the temporary suspension. If successfully introduced permanently, the law will make Thailand's packet warnings the largest in the world, leading the way to further reducing the tobacco industry's control over advertising. Sources: see references ( 13). Global status report on NCDs 2014 60were not traditionally covered by such regulations, such as prisons and private vehicles when carrying children. Warning about the dangers of tobacco By 2013, 38 countries had legislated strong warn- ing labels occupying at least 50% of the surface of cigarette packages. 19 of these countries had done this since 2010. Middle-income countries are the most likely to have established strong warning-la- bel requirements (27% of middle-income countries have done so). In addition, the number of countries with very weak or no pack health warnings dropped from 91 to 68 between 2010 and 2013. Th ere has been a move towards very large pictorial warnings (occupying, in general, more than 60% of principal display areas) on tobacco packages, and standard- ized (or plain) packaging in line with the obliga- tions of the WHO FCTC ( 5).Enforcing bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship While 133 countries had banned some forms of tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (TAPS) in 2013, only 27 had completely banned all its forms, nine more than in 2010. Low-income countries have taken greater action to ban TAPS completely (19%) than have high- and middle-in- come countries (6% and 16% respectively). Th e number of countries with a very weak or no ban on TAPS fell from 77 in 2010 to 62 in 2013. Raising taxes on tobacco Th e most cost-eff ective tobacco-control intervention is to increase the price of tobacco products by raising tobacco tax, but this measure has progressed slowly since 2010. In 2010, 27 countries were levying taxes high enough to represent at least 75% of the retail price of cigarettes but by 2013 this had increased only Box 5.4 Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, Paci c islands and the UK (Scotland): aiming at a tobacco endgame Some governments have outlined a strategic plan to further reduce tobacco preva- lence to a de ned low level - usually close to zero - within a xed period, using the \"tobacco endgame approach\" . Strategies that can result in an endgame involve full implementation of the WHO FCTC (5), with fundamental denormalization not just of tobacco use but of the tobacco industry, by removing pro tability and by making the industry liable for damages. Furthermore, the focus on disadvantaged groups and po-licy action with tobacco control address the wider social determinants of inequalities and health. A commitment to a tobacco endgame has been made by Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, Paci c islands and the UK (Scotland), which have publicly announced a target year to end tobacco use in their populations. These countries are committed to decreasing tobacco use to below 5% by the target year. Sources: see references ( 15). Box 5.5 A knowledge hub for tobacco control in Africa As part of the Africa project funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foun- dation, WHO has set up the rst knowledge hub for tobacco control in the Centre for Tobacco Control in Africa (CTCA) in Kampala, Uganda. CTCA provides technical assistance to a number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa, on tobacco-control policies, legislation and programmes. Sources: see references ( 16). Chapter 5. Global target 5 61to 32 countries. Low-income countries, although in greater need of government funding for tobac- co-control and health programmes, are least likely to have suffi ciently high tax rates; only one low-income country has achieved high taxes on cigarettes. In addition, the number of countries with a low tax share of the retail price (below 25%), or no tobacco taxes, increased from 29 in 2010 to 37 in 2013. Progress has been notable in some countries (see Boxes 5.25.6 ). Th e next step is to encourage other countries to follow suit, by highlighting the eff ectiveness of existing examples of tobacco-con- trol policies and by off ering additional support to adopt and implement such policies. Conclusion Th ere has been great progress in global tobac- co-control eff orts in recent years, in both the num- ber of countries protecting their people and the number of people worldwide protected by eff ective tobacco-control measures. However, more work is needed in many countries, in order to focus eff orts on passing and enforcing eff ective tobacco-control measures. Th is will include expanding activities to implement \"best-buy\" demand-reduction measures at the highest level of achievement, reinforcing and sustaining current programmes to incorporate a range of measures and, ultimately, implementing the full WHO FCTC ( 5).Box 5.6 Mobile cessation (mCessation) in Costa Rica Costa Rica has had a campaign to lower smoking rates for several years. To in- crease public outreach, it was decided to use the growing mobile telephone user base to connect with smokers and help them quit, using mCessation methods. In collaboration with the WHO-ITU mHealth initiative, Costa launched \u00abQuit Smoking\u00bb (Dejar de fumar), to support existing cessation services within the health system. The programme is based on text messaging, using standar-dized protocols and adapted to the country context. Further monitoring and evaluation is required to validate ndings, but initial results indicate that mobile-based smoking-cessation programmes can be used successfully to help smokers quit in Costa Rica. Sources: see references ( 17). Th e successes of most countries in applying tobacco demand-reduction measures demonstrate that it is possible to tackle the tobacco epidemic regardless of size or income. Most progress in protecting people with these measures has been made by low- and middle-income countries, which remain at greatest risk from eff orts of the tobacco industry to increase tobacco use. Despite the achievements in some countries in establishing eff ective tobacco-control measures, no country has entirely succeeded in protecting its population from the eff ects of tobacco. Eff orts must be accelerated in all countries to save even more lives. Actions required to achieve this target Parties to the WHO FCTC ( 5) reported in 2014 an overall implementation of 54% of the substantive obligations of the treaty ( 18). Despite signifi cant progress and global commitment to reduce tobacco consumption under the obligations of the conven- tion, including the increase in countries imple- menting tobacco-control \"best buys\" at the highest level, signifi cant challenges remain for achieving the global target of reducing tobacco use by 30%. Th e challenges to the successful implementation of tobacco-control policies range from insuffi cient political will and weak intersectoral cooperation, to weak implementation or enforcement capacities.Global status report on NCDs 2014 62Th e fi rst challenge to tobacco control is a direct result of strong political and public commitment at the time of the WHO FCTC negotiation and some early and positive responses. However, aft er initial success with a number of the WHO FCTC obligations, especially in areas such as smoke-free policies and large pictorial health warnings, there appears to be some complacency which is hinder- ing eff orts to move ahead and leading to \"tobac- co-control fatigue\". Some countries have begun to discuss how to lower the prevalence of smoking below 5%, in what it is called the \"tobacco endgame approach\". However, while discussion of the end- game as a motivational tool for continuing reduc-tion of the tobacco epidemic in some countries is of great importance in overcoming complacency, it should not be mistaken for an announcement of the end of the tobacco epidemic, because much remains to be done. Th e second challenge has been the diffi culty of ensuring that some \"best-buy\" policies at the highest level of achievement are actually adopted by governments. Th e problem is typically due either to poor political will or to interference from the tobacco industry, or both. Th ere is good evidence that tobacco taxation off ers the best potential for impact on reduction rates, yet it is one of the least implemented measures in national eff orts, with only 32 of 195 countries having developed com- plete policies on tobacco taxation, demonstrating the need for stronger political engagement ( 3,19). Greater priority needs to be given to developing new strategies to support whole-of-government action in adopting and implementing sound national pol- icies in accordance with all provisions of the WHO FCTC ( 5). Th e diff erent elements aff ecting these broader national challenges to global tobacco control can be broken down under the subheadings that follow. Increasing implementation support As progress in approval of the WHO FCTC pol-icies ( 5) continues, many countries face the chal- lenges of implementation and enforcement. Th ese may include providing additional support and guidance to countries, building and engaging in multisectoral partnerships in specialized areas of tobacco-control policies such as international trade, eliminating illicit trade in tobacco products, and other related activities that serve to facilitate the ground-level adoption and enforcement of tobac- co-control policies. Revitalizing political and public willpower Countries need to remain aware that tobacco con- tinues to be a signifi cant threat to public health, avoiding a sense that the worst is over, which, as mentioned above, is leading to problems of com- placency in implementation eff orts. Th ere is also increasing fatigue in communication eff orts, which risks a resurgence of tobacco use among commu- nities and individuals, as a result of it ceasing to be considered a major health concern. While attain- ment of the tobacco-reduction target is achievable, a more audacious strategy may be needed to revi- talize political and public willpower to advance progress. Countering tobacco industry interference Tobacco industry interference is one of the key challenges to the creation and implementation of tobacco-reduction measures. It continues to under- mine control eff orts globally, and more needs to be done to counter its negative infl uence. In fact, during the reporting cycle of the WHO FCTC, which ended at the beginning of 2014, the chal- lenge mentioned most frequently by Parties to the convention was tobacco industry interference. Th e tobacco industry continues to use legal challenges (oft en employed without success) to national tobac- co-control measures, including litigation or support for litigation under multilateral and bilateral trade and investment agreements, to prevent, delay or weaken implementation of tobacco-control mea-sures. Both the threat and active pursuit of legal challenges appear to be becoming more prominent, as Parties continue to implement the WHO FCTC. Article 5.3 of the treaty ( 5) clearly mandates Par- ties to the convention to prevent tobacco industry interference in tobacco control and public health. Th e tobacco industry is experienced in fostering partnerships with a range of sectors and interest Chapter 5. Global target 5 63groups, which has enabled it to put increasing pres- sure on tobacco-control measures, by diversifying the angles from which they are able to encourage dissent. A clear area of improvement for tobac- co-control eff orts is in redressing this imbalance by extending preventative action to other sectors such as fi nance, international trade and agriculture. Additionally, countries should seek to implement clear monitoring systems for industry activities across all sectors, to gauge the extent of infl uence and map potential obstructions to tobacco-control policies. Approaching tobacco as a multisectoral problem for the whole government A focus on tobacco as an exclusively public health concern limits the chance for success in attaining the global target. Th is limited focus is causing implementation problems in cross-sectoral areas of tobacco-reduction measures, including min-imal dialogue between fi nance, trade and health ministries in many countries. Tobacco control is multisectoral, and therefore requires an increase in intersectoral discussions and actions. These may include policy focus on the relation between tobacco controls and international trade, or alter- native livelihoods for tobacco farmers. A unifocal approach to tobacco control misses opportunities for synergistic programmes with other communicable and noncommunicable disease programmes, such as for tuberculosis or respiratory diseases. It also misses the conspicuous need to integrate tobacco-control eff orts within the wider health-development agenda.Global status report on NCDs 2014 64References 1.

Global target 5 65 Raised blood pressure is one of the leading risk factors for global mortality and is estimated to have caused 9.4 million deaths and 7% of disease burden - as measured in disability-adjusted life-years in 2010. Th e global prevalence of raised blood pressure (defi ned as systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg) in adults aged 18 years and over was around 22% in 2014. Reducing the incidence of hypertension through implementation of population-wide policies to reduce behavioural risk factors, including harmful use of alcohol, physical inactivity, overweight, obesity and high salt intake, is essential to attaining this target. Control of hypertension through a total cardiovascular risk approach is more cost eff ective than treatment decisions based on individual risk factor thresholds only. A total-risk approach needs to be adopted for early detection and cost-eff ective management of hypertension, to prevent heart attacks, strokes and other complications. Th e attainment of this target will contribute to attainment of the target on reducing premature mortality from NCDs.Key points67Raised blood pressure and its impact on health Raised blood pressure is one of the leading risk factors for global mortality and is estimated to have caused 9.4 million deaths and 7% of disease burden - as measured in DALYs in 2010 ( 1). Raised blood pressure is a major cardiovascular risk factor. If left uncontrolled, hypertension causes stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, dementia, renal failure and blindness, causing human suff ering and imposing severe fi nancial and service burdens on health systems ( 2,3). Scientifi c studies have consistently shown the health benefi ts of lowering blood pressure through population-wide and individual (behavioural and pharmacolog- ical) interventions ( 46). For instance, a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg is associated with a 22% reduction in coronary heart disease and 41% reduction in stroke in randomized trials ( 5), and a 41-46% reduction in cardiomet- abolic mortality ( 6) in epidemiological studies.

Th e proportion of the world's pop- ulation with high blood pressure or uncontrolled hypertension fell modestly between 1980 and 2010. However, because of population growth and ageing, the number of people with uncontrolled hyperten- sion has risen over the years.

Across the WHO regions, the prevalence of raised blood pressure was high- est in Africa, at 30% for all adults combined. Th e lowest prevalence of raised blood pressure was in Chapter 6. Global target 6 69the Region of the Americas, at 18% (see Fig. 6.3 ). Men in this region had higher prevalence (21 % ) than women (16%). In all WHO regions, men have slightly higher prevalence of raised blood pressure than women. Fig. 6.5 shows the age-standardized prevalence of raised blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and over by country and World Bank income group in 2014. In general, the prevalence of raised blood pressure was higher in low-income countries compared to middle-income and high-in- come countries (see Fig 6.5 ). Many factors contribute to the high prevalence rates of hypertension(see Fig. 6.4 ): eating food containing too much salt and fat; not eating enough fruits and vegetables; overweight and obesity; harmful use of alcohol; physical inactivity; ageing; genetic factors; psychological stress; socioeconomic determinants; inadequate access to health care. Hypertension is not an inevitable consequence of ageing. In the majority of cases, the exact cause of hypertension is unknown, but the presence of several of the above factors, increase the risk of developing the condition. Most of these factors are modifi able. What are the cost-e ective policies and interventions to reduce the prevalence of raised blood pressure? In order to achieve this target, a comprehensive set of population-wide and individual interventions and policies is required to address the modifi able risk factors listed above. Very cost-eff ective pop- ulation-wide interventions are available to reduce harmful use of alcohol (see Chapter 2 ), physical inactivity (see Chapter 3 ), population intake of salt/ sodium (see Chapter 4 ), overweight and obesity and intake of saturated fats (see Chapter 7 ), and to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables Figure 6.4 Main contributory factors to high blood pressure and its complications ( 3) Social determinants and drivers Globalization Urbanization Ageing Income Education HousingSocial determinants and driversSocial determinants and drivers Unhealthy diet Tobacco use Physical inactivity Harmfull use of AlcoholBehaviour risk factorsSocial determinants and drivers High blood pressure Obesity Diabetes Raised blood lipidsMetabolic risk factorsSocial determinants and drivers Heart attack Strokes Heart failureCardiovascular diseaseGlobal status report on NCDs 2014 70Andorra 24.4 Antigua and Barbuda 22.6 Australia 19.0 Austria 24.8 Bahamas 22.1Bahrain 19.2 Barbados 26.0 Belgium 23.8 Brunei Darussalam 17.9 Canada 17.3 Chile 23.1 Croatia 35.8 Cyp rus 21.9 Czech Republic 33.2 Denmark 26. 3 Equatoria l Guinea 25.2Estonia 39.2 Finland 27.1 France 27.5Ge rm any 27.1Gre ece 25.0Iceland 23.6 Irel and Uru 25.8 0%50% 20% 10%30%40% Afghanistan 21.7 Bangladesh 21.5 Benin 23.8 Burkina Faso 25.1 Burundi 22.9 Cambodia 21.1 Central African Republic 26.4 Chad 25.1 Comoros 23.0 Democratic People's Republic of Korea 22.1 Democratic Republic of th e Congo 24.8 Eritrea 21. 9Ethiopia 24.4 Gambia 23.5 Guinea 25.3Guinea-Bissau 26.2 Hait 2.3Zimbabwe 22.1 0%50% 20% 10%30%40%High-income Low-incomeFig. 6.5 Age-standardized prevalence of raised blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and over (de ned as systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure equal to or above 140/90 mm Hg) (%), by individual country, and by World Bank Income group, comparable estimates, 2014Chapter 6.

Th ese interventions should be imple- mented to prevent hypertension and to shift the population distribution of blood pressure to an optimal profi le (7). In addition, there must be equitable access to individual interventions, particularly at primary health-care level. People with hypertension are oft en asymptomatic until they develop end-organ damage ( 2,3). Consequently, proactive cost-eff ec- tive approaches must be adopted for early detection of hypertension. Evidence indicates that targeted screening for total cardiovascular risk with blood pressure measurement (and blood glucose testing) is more cost eff ective than screening the whole pop- ulation for a single risk factor, and is more likely to identify individuals at high cardiovascular risk for lower cost ( 810 ). In settings with access to well-developed primary health-care systems (i.e. where physicians can identify patients at high risk of developing diseases when they see them for other reasons, and can intervene when necessary), adding an organized screening programme to usual prac-tice may not be required. Indeed, in such settings, systematic screening of the population has not resulted in a reduction in incidence of ischaemic heart disease compared to control groups that have access to usual care ( 11,12 ). Th ere are several barriers to accurate and aff ord- able blood pressure measurement, particularly in low-and middle income countries ( 13). Th ese include: Th e absence of accurate, easily-obtainable, inex- pensive devices for blood pressure measurement; Th e frequent marketing of non-validated blood pressure measuring devices; Th e relatively high cost of blood pressure devices given the limited resources available; Limited awareness of the problems associated with conventional blood pressure measurement techniques; A general lack of trained manpower and limited training of personnel. The health system must be able to manage those detected with hypertension, using aff ordable approaches, particularly in resource-constrained settings ( 14). A total-risk approach is needed to improve the effi ciency and eff ectiveness of detection and management of hypertension ( 2,3,15 ). Deci- sions on drug treatment should be underpinned by evidence and based on total cardiovascular risk (15,16 ). Evidence of benefi t for lowering blood pres- sure levels at or above 160/100 mmHg with drug treatment and non-pharmacological measures is very clear ( 2,3,15 ). Lower degrees of persistent hypertension (140/90 mm Hg) with moder-ate-to-high cardiovascular risk also require drug treatment ( 2,3,15 ). On the other hand, there is no evidence to justify drug treatment of persons with borderline hypertension and very low cardiovas- cular risk. People in this category, however, would benefi t from the population-wide interventions alluded to above ( 2,3). Monitoring the prevalence of raised blood pressure In the global monitoring framework ( 17, see Annex 1 ), the indicator for monitoring the preva- lence of raised blood pressure is the age-standard- ized prevalence of raised blood pressure among persons aged 18+ years ( 7). Raised blood pressure is defi ned as systolic blood pressure 140mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg among persons aged 18+ years. For monitoring of progress, data should be gathered from a popula- tion-based (preferably nationally representative) survey in which blood pressure was measured (not self-reported). Progress achieved High-income countries have begun to reduce hypertension through strong public health policies to reduce salt in processed food (see Chapter 4 ), improve the availability and aff ordability of fruits and vegetables ( 18), and create environments that promote physical activity (see Chapter 3 ). Declin- ing trends in blood pressure, together with declines in smoking, body mass index (BMI) and serum cholesterol, may have accounted for nearly half the decline in cardiovascular mortality in some Chapter 6. Global target 6 73high-income countries ( 4). However, shortcom- ings in public health policies to address intake of salt and fruits and vegetables, physical inactivity, and overweight and obesity have resulted in rising trends in blood pressure in low- and middle-income countries. Th e country capacity assessment survey con- ducted in 2013 indicates many gaps in the imple- mentation of public health policies that are key to prevention of hypertension (see Table 6.1 ) (19). High-income countries had the highest per- centage of national policies, plans or strategies. Th e percentage of countries reporting policies, plans or strategies on behavioural risk factors was generally lowest in the WHO African Region, except for pol- icies, plans or strategies on harmful use of alcohol, which were reported in an even lower percentage of countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (see Fig. 6.6 ). The number of people with undetected and uncontrolled hypertension has increased worldwide Fig. 6.6 Policies, plans and strategies to address behavioural risk factors of hypertension, by WHO region and World Bank income level 100% 80%60%40%20% 0%Number of countries AFR=African Region, AMR=Region of the Americas, SEAR =South-East A sia EMR AMR AFRQ\u0003Tobacco use; strategy or action plan or policy - operational Q\u0003Unhealthy diet; strategy or action plan or policy - operational Q\u0003Physical inactivity; strategy or action plan or policy - operational Q\u0003Overweight and obesity; strategy or action plan or policy - operational Q\u0003Harmful use of alcohol; strategy or action plan or policy - operational \u0003because of population growth and ageing ( 4). Stud- ies in high-income countries report that about one fi ft h of people with hypertension are unaware of their condition, about one quarter do not receive treatment and only around half have their blood pressure under control ( 20,21 ). Th e situation is much worse in low- and middle-income countries, where only about half of those with hypertension are aware of their status, only a fraction receive treatment, and the majority do not have their blood pressure under control ( 22,23 ). In general, aware- ness, treatment and control are lower in people with lower levels of literacy and socioeconomic status. Actions required to attain this target Th ere are signifi cant health and economic gains in attaining this target. Worldwide, the high prev- alence of hypertension contributes signifi cantly to preventable cardiovascular events. As already Global status report on NCDs 2014 74discussed, in most countries, many people with raised blood pressure are unaware that they have hypertension, and detection and control rates are suboptimal. Once hypertension develops, it may require lifelong treatment with medicines. Because of the high prevalence, drug treatment can be costly and is a challenge for resource-constrained settings. However, neglecting treatment entails interventions that are even more costly, such as cardiac bypass surgery, carotid artery surgery and renal dialysis, draining both individual and government budgets. Th e only solution is to control hypertension using an aff ordable total-risk approach, and concurrently take action to reduce its incidence. Th e actions that are needed to attain this target, are listed under the subheadings that follow. Implement public health policies to reduce the incidence of hypertension Top priority should be accorded to implemen- tation of public health policies to reduce exposure to behavioural risk factors: harmful use of alcohol (see Chapter 2 ), physical inactivity (see Chapter 3 ), high salt intake (see Chapter 4) and tobacco use (see Chapter 5 ). Policies to address overweight and obe- sity (see Chapter 7 ) also have a signifi cant impact on the incidence of hypertension.Establish integrated programmes for hypertension and diabetes in primary care Integrated NCD programmes can be established at the primary care level, using WHO guidelines and tools ( 24). One objective of an integrated pro- gramme is to reduce total cardiovascular risk to prevent heart attack, stroke, kidney failure and other complications of hypertension and diabe-tes. Hypertension and diabetes oft en coexist and they cannot be dealt with in isolation. Adopting this comprehensive approach ensures that limited resources are used for the treatment of those at medium and high risk. It also prevents unnec-essary drug treatment of people with borderline hypertension and very low cardiovascular risk. Inappropriate drug treatment exposes people to unwarranted harmful eff ects and increases the cost of health care. Both should be avoided. Investments are needed to improve health-service infrastructure and human and fi nancial resources, to create a health-care system that is capable of deploying and sustaining equitable and quality-as- sured programmes for addressing cardiovascular risk (see Chapter 8 ). Appropriate communication and awareness-creation strategies are essential to ensure high coverage and follow-up care. Informa- tion systems should be in place to facilitate monitor- ing and evaluation of inputs and outcomes. Eff ective Box 6.1 Non-physician health workers implement the total-risk approach using hypertension as an entry point in Bhutan In Paro and Bumthang districts of Bhutan, trained non-physician health workers carried out cardiovascular risk assessment and mana-gement in primary care, using hypertension as an entry point. In this project, initiated in 2009, simpli ed protocols of the WHO package of essential noncommunicable disease (PEN) interventions were used to implement a total-risk approach. Regular audits checked the adequacy of human resources, availability of equipment and labo-ratory reagents, adherence to clinical protocols, and maintenance of stock registers. A performance assessment in 2013 showed that im- plementation of the total-risk approach in primary health care in Bhutan led to signi cant improvement in blood pressure and diabetes control, and reduction in cardiovascular risk . In collaboration with ministries of health, WHO has initiated similar projects in primary care in some 30 resource-constrained settings. Sources: see references ( 24,25 ). Chapter 6. Global target 6 75training and reorientation of health-care workers, including non-physician health workers, are criti- cal for improving provider performance and com- petency. With adequate training and supervision, non-physician health workers can play a key role in cardiovascular risk assessment and management, particularly in primary health care (see Box 6.1 ). Strategies to enhance adherence Th e control of hypertension and cardiovascular risk, rely on individuals being adherent to measures to reduce behavioural risk factors and drug treat- ment as prescribed. Adherence requires a strategic policy to address the issue at the outset. Patients should be educated upon diagnosis and adherence enhancing strategies should be implemented to ensure ongoing control of cardiovascular risk. Where measurement devices are affordable, self-monitoring of blood pressure is recommended for the management of hypertension and diabe- tes ( 24). As with other NCDs, evidence-based approaches to strengthen self-care can facilitate early detection of hypertension, adherence to med- ication, and healthy behaviours, better control, and awareness of the importance of seeking medical advice when necessary. Self-care is important for all, but it is particularly useful for persons who have limited access to health services due to geograph- ical, physical or economic reasons. Promote workplace wellness programmes Th e United Nations high-level meeting on NCD prevention and control in 2011 called on the private sector to \"promote and create an enabling envi- ronment for healthy behaviours among workers (26), including by establishing tobacco-free work- places and safe and healthy working environments through occupational safety and health measures, including, where appropriate, through good cor- porate practices, workplace wellness programmes and health insurance plans\". Workplace wellness programmes should focus on promoting worker health through the reduction of individual risk-re- lated behaviours (e.g. tobacco use, unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol, physical inactivity and other health-risk behaviours). Th ese programmes have the potential to reach a signifi cant proportion of employed adults for early detection of hyperten- sion, diabetes and other illnesses.Global status report on NCDs 2014 76References 1.

Worldwide, obesity has more than doubled since 1980, and in 2014, 11% of men and 15% of women aged 18 years and older were obese. An estimated 42 million children under the age of 5 years were overweight in 2013. Th e global prevalence of diabetes was estimated to be 9% in 2014. Obesity can be prevented through multisectoral population-based interventions that promote physical activity and consumption of a healthy diet, throughout the life-course. Research is urgently needed to evaluate the eff ectiveness of interventions to prevent and control obesity. Th e attainment of this target will contribute to attainment of targets on reducing the prevalence of hypertension and on reducing premature mortality from NCDs.Key points79Overweight and obesity and their impact on health Th e link between obesity, poor health outcomes and all-cause mortality is well established. Obesity increases the likelihood of diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, certain cancers, obstructive sleep apnoea and osteoarthritis. It also negatively aff ects reproductive performance. Overweight and obesity - i.e. BMI 25 kg/m2 and 30 kg/m2 respectively - were estimated to account for 3.4 million deaths per year and 93.6 million DALYs in 2010 ( 1). To achieve optimal health, the median BMI for adult populations should be in the range 21-23 kg/m2, while the goal for individuals should be to maintain a BMI in the range 18.524.9 kg/m2. Th e risk of comorbidities increases with a BMI in the range 25.029.9 kg/m2, and the risk is moderate to severe with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 (2). Prevalence of overweight and obesity in adults Obesity has been increasing in all countries. In 2014, 39% of adults aged 18 years and older (38% of men and 40% of women) were overweight. Th e worldwide prevalence of obesity nearly doubled between 1980 and 2014. In 2014, 11% of men and 15% of women worldwide were obese. Th us, more than half a billion adults worldwide are classed as obese. Age-standardized estimates on prevalence of obesity in males and females, aged 18 years and over are shown in Figs. 7.1 and 7.2, respectively. Th e prevalence of overweight and obesity is highest in the Region of the Americas (61% overweight or obese in both sexes, and 27% obese) and lowest in the South-East Asia Region (22% overweight in both sexes, and 5% obese) (see Fig. 7.3 ). In the European and Eastern Mediterranean Regions and Region of the Americas, over 50% of women are over-weight, and in all three regions roughly half of overweight women are obese (25% in the European region, 24% in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 30% in the Region of the Americas). In all WHO regions, women are more likely to be obese than men. In the African, South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions,, women have roughly double the obesity prevalence of men. Fig. 7.5 shows the age-standardized prevalence of obesity in adults aged 18 years and over, by country, and World Bank income groups in 2014. Th e prevalence of overweight and obesity increases with the income level of countries. Th e prevalence of obesity in high-income and upper-mid- dle-income countries is more than double that of low- income countries. (see Fig. 7.3 7Global target 7: Halt the rise in diabetes and obesity Global status report on NCDs 2014 80and 7.5). Although the Western Pacifi c Region ranks low in prevalence of obesity, the Pacifi c countries show high rates similar to the Americas.

Th e prevalence of overweight pre-school aged children is increasing fastest in low- and lower-middle-in- come countries (see Figs. 7.4 and 7.6) (3). In 2013, an estimated 42 million children (6.3%) aged under 5 years were overweight ( 3). Th e latest estimates show that the global prev- alence of overweight and obesity in children aged under 5 years has increased from around 5% in 2000 Chapter 7. Global target 7 81to 6% in 2010 and 6.3% in 2013 ( 4). Th e prevalence of childhood overweight is increasing worldwide, but especially in Africa and Asia. Between 2000 and 2013, the prevalence of overweight in children aged under 5 years increased from 11% to 19% in some countries in southern Africa and from 3% to 7% in South-East Asia (UN region). In 2013, there were an estimated 18 million overweight children aged under 5 years Fig. 7.3 Age-standardized prevalence of obesity in adults aged 18 years and over (BMI 30 kg/m2), by WHO region and World Bank income group, comparable country estimates, 2014 Q Males Q Females 35% 30%25%20%15%10% 5%0%% of population AFR=African Region, AMR=Region of the Americas, SEAR =South-East A sia EUR EMR AMR AFRin Asia, 11 million in Africa and 4 million in Latin America and the Caribbean. Th ere was little change in the prevalence of overweight in children in Latin America and the Caribbean over the last 13 years, but countries with large populations had levels of 7% and higher. It is estimated that the prevalence of overweight in children aged under 5 years will rise to 11% worldwide by 2025 if current trends continue ( 4).

In 2012, the World Health Assembly agreed a target of no increase in childhood overweight by 2025 ( 5). To accelerate WHO's eff orts to address the issue, in May 2014 the Director-General of WHO established a high-level Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity. Diabetes/raised blood glucose and its impact on health Diabetes is a well-recognized cause of premature death and disability, increasing the risk of car- diovascular disease, kidney failure, blindness and lower-limb amputation ( 6). People with impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia are also at risk of future development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease ( 7). In recent decades, the prevalence of diabetes has been increasing globally, and has been particularly accelerated in low- and middle-income countries. Th is rise is largely driven by modifi able risk factors - particu- larly physical activity, overweight and obesity ( 8). A few high-income countries have documented a levelling-off of obesity prevalence in children ( 9,10), although the benefi cial eff ect of this on diabetes risk will take time, unless a similar change occurs in adults. Population ageing is also an important factor, as glucose intolerance increases with age. Much of the diabetes burden can be prevented or delayed by behavioural changes favouring a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Diabetes was directly responsible for 1.5 million deaths in 2012 and 89 million DALYs. Th e global prevalence of diabetes (defi ned as a fasting plasma glucose value 7.0 mmol/L [126 mg/dl] or being on medication for raised blood glucose) was estimated to be 9% in 2014. Th e prevalence of diabetes was highest in the WHO Region of the Eastern Mediter- ranean Region (14% for both sexes) and lowest in the European and Western Pacifi c Regions (8% and 9% for both sexes, respectively) (see Figs. 7.7 and 7.8). In general, low-income countries showed the lowest prevalence and upper-middle-income coun- tries showed the highest prevalence of diabetes for both sexes (see Fig. 7.9 ). Monitoring the rates of obesity and diabetes Indicators in the global monitoring framework ( 11) for monitoring progress in attaining this target are: Fig. 7.6 Prevalence of overweight in children aged under 5 years, by WHO region and World Bank income group, comparable estimates, 2013 14% 12%10% 8%6%4%2%0%% of population AFR=African Region, AMR=Region of the Americas, SEAR =South-East A sia EUR=European EMR=Eastern AMR AFRChapter 7.

Th e WHO STEPwise approach to Surveillance of NCD Risk Factors (STEPS) is used by many coun- tries to track national prevalence data for obesity and raised blood glucose in adults ( 14). In some countries, demographic and health surveys also collect data on BMI. WHO's Global school-based student health survey ( 15) is used in many countries to measure and monitor overweight and obesity in adolescents; while data in children aged under 5 years are collected routinely through demographic and health surveys, multiple indicator cluster sur- veys, and other surveys. Th e national target can be fi xed according to the epidemiological profi le of each country and what might be achievable. Th e national target can aim to halt the epidemic and ultimately reverse the trend. Countries may consider an immediate focus on reducing the incidence of obesity in children and adolescents, and a longer-term target of reducing the prevalence in adults. A zero increase in diabetes incidence rather than prevalence would be confi rmation that modifi able risk factors are being controlled successfully. How- ever, this is a much stricter target and measurement of the number of new cases would be too complex, since diabetes is asymptomatic and undiagnosed in 3080% of cases ( 16).What are the cost-e ective policies and interventions for reducing the prevalence of obesity and diabetes ? Although evidence on what works as a package of interventions for obesity prevention is limited, much is known about promotion of healthy diets and physical activity, which are key to attaining the obesity and diabetes targets. Evidence of popula- tion-wide policies and settings-based and individu- al-based interventions that have worked in diff erent countries is described below. Population-wide policies Evidence suggests that changes in agricultural subsidies to encourage fruit and vegetable produc- tion could be benefi cial in increasing the consump- tion of fruits and vegetables and improving dietary patterns ( 17). Evidence strongly supports the use of such subsidies and related policies to facilitate sustained long-term production, transportation and marketing of healthier foods ( 17). Price is oft en reported as a barrier to the pur- chase and consumption of healthy foods ( 18). Pric- ing strategies that increase incentives for purchasing healthier food options also increase the purchase of those options ( 19). Taxation schemes that produce large changes in price can change purchasing habits and are likely to improve health ( 20,21 ). Hungary introduced a \"junk food tax\" on foods high in sugar, salt and caff eine (see Box 7.1 ), and Box 7.1 Hungary impact assessment of the Public Health Product Tax On 19 July 2011 Hungary passed the law \"Act CIII of 2011 on the Public Health Product Tax\" related to tax on food and drink compo-nents with a high risk for health. The tax liability of a product de-pends on its sugar, salt and ca eine content. One year later, an im- pact assessment was conducted, based on surveys of the public and manufacturers. Results show that 40% of responding manufacturers changed the product formula to reduce the taxable ingredient. The sale of products subject to tax decreased by 27% and people consu-med 2535% fewer products subject to tax than one year earlier. Sources: see references ( 25). Chapter 7. Global target 7 89France introduced a tax on sweetened drinks ( 22). In 2013, the Mexican congress passed taxes on soda and junk food ( 23). Several other countries are also considering such taxes ( 24). Trade and regulatory measures have also proven eff ective in reducing the availability of unhealthy foods and changing population dietary patterns ( 26,27 ). In 2000, Fiji banned the supply of mutton fl aps (high in fat) under the Trading Standards Act ( 26). In Mauritius, the focus of reg- ulation was the reduction of saturated fatty acids in cooking oil and its replacement with soybean oil. Th e policy is estimated to have changed con- sumption patterns favourably and reduced average total cholesterol levels ( 27). Measuring the impact of these approaches on obesity and diabetes is of utmost importance. Th ere is ample evidence that marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages infl uences children's knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and preferences. Based on this evidence, WHO has developed a set of rec- ommendations and an implementation framework on the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic bev- erages to children ( 28). Th is aims to assist Mem- ber States to design and implement new policies, or strengthen existing ones, on food-marketing communications to children. To facilitate imple- mentation, WHO has developed a regional nutrient profi le model in the European Region, to guide the marketing of food and non-alcoholic beverages to children. Other WHO regions are developing their own nutrition profi le models. Nutrition labelling can be useful in orienting consumers to products that contribute to a healthier diet. Th ere is evidence that simple, front-of-pack labels on packaged foods, or point-of-purchase information in grocery stores, cafeterias or restau- rants, can be benefi cial, as labelling to support healthier options ( 29-31 ). Th ere is also evidence that combining nutrition labelling with environmental and/or nutrition education mea- sures can be even more eff ective in changing con- sumer behaviour and consumption patterns ( 30). Consumer awareness of healthy diet and physical activity can be achieved through sustained media and educational campaigns aimed at increasing consumption of healthy foods, or reducing con- sumption of less healthy ones and increasing phys- ical activity. Th ese campaigns have greater impact and are more cost-eff ective when used within mul- ticomponent strategies ( 24). Settings-based interventions Settings-based interventions can be eff ective in preventing and controlling diabetes and obesity. A settings-based approach reaches families and com- munities where they live, work and play. Settings include schools, universities, workplaces, commu- nities, and health-care and religious settings.Box 7.2 Brazil - healthy school food policy Brazil's national school feeding programme, launched in 1955, is men- tioned in the country's constitution and covers nearly 47 million children. Its objectives are to contribute to the growth, development and lear-ning capabilities of students, to support the formation of healthy habits through food and nutrition education, and to promote local family far-ming through food purchase. School meals meet national nutrition stan-dards, with mandatory inclusion of fruits and vegetables. The national programme requires that schools purchase locally grown or manufactured products, stimulating the local economy. Brazilian law requires that 70% of the food served to children in school meal programmes is unprocessed (e.g. rice, beans, meat, sh, fruits or vege- tables) and 30% is locally sourced. Regular government purchases from family farms have led to improved quality of unprocessed food and increased availability and consumption of fruits and vegetables by school children. Sources: see references ( 34,35 ). Global status report on NCDs 2014 90Th e school is an important setting for promoting healthy diets and physical activity. WHO's Health Promoting Schools Initiative ( 32) and the Nutri- tion-Friendly School Initiative ( 33) were developed to address the double burden of undernutrition and overweight/obesity that many countries face. A \"whole of school\" approach focused on improv- ing both diet and physical activity (including pro- vision of a healthy food option in school cafeterias, a supportive environment for physical activity, and specialized educational curricula) can be very eff ec- tive in improving dietary patterns both inside and outside school ( 24,30,31 ). Provision of fresh fruit and vegetables to students at school can infl uence dietary behaviour outside school without extra cost (see Box 7.2 ) (22). Worksite interventions addressing diet and phys- ical activity are eff in changing behaviours and health-related outcomes ( 36,37 ). Workplace vending machine prompts, labels or icons can be successful in changing dietary patterns, when com- bined with increased availability of healthier food options ( 24). Healthy-eating messages in cafeterias and restaurants have been shown to stimulate con- sumption of healthy food provided that healthy food items are made available as part of the inter- vention ( 38). Individual interventions Diet and physical activity counselling through primary health care have the potential to change behaviours related to obesity and diabetes ( 39). Th e provision of dietary counselling, especially as a component of a total-risk approach, has the potential to be benefi cial ( 39). Positive results of eff ective risk-factor control can be seen in a short time, since any reduction in body weight and increase in physical activity has a benefi cial eff ect on the risk of diabetes. Th is inter- vention has been scaled up to the whole population in a few high-income countries, and encouraging results on feasibility have been reported from Fin- land ( 40). However, it has not been implemented at scale in low- and middle-income countries. Th ere is currently no evidence on the eff ectiveness of large-scale interventions on the whole population for reversing or stopping the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity. Th ere is some evidence that diabetes incidence, prevalence and mortality have been reduced where external circumstances imposed a lowering of the caloric intake and an increase in physical activity on the whole popula- tion ( 41,42 ). Actions required to attain this target Th e target of no increase in prevalence of obesity and diabetes is closely linked with the target of decreasing physical inactivity (see Chapter 3 ). To maintain a healthy weight, there must be a bal- ance between energy consumed (through diet) and energy expended (through physical activity). Fail- ure to breastfeed, or a shorter duration of breast- feeding, are also associated with a higher risk of overweight later in life ( 43). To prevent obesity, multisectoral popula- tion-based action is required, focusing on prenatal, infancy and childhood health actions targeting the most vulnerable groups. Th e ministry of health will need to take leadership and engage with other rele- vant government sectors in a national multisectoral action plan (see Chapter 10 ). Policies should simul- taneously address diff erent sectors that contribute to the production, distribution and marketing of food, while concurrently shaping an environment that facilitates and promotes adequate levels of physical activity ( 44-47 ). For the management of obesity, low-energy diets are eff ective in the short term, but reducing inactiv- ity, increasing walking, and developing an activity programme can increase the eff ectiveness of obe- sity therapy. Treating associated health risks and established complications is important. In addition, there needs to be strengthening of health systems to address obesity and diabetes as clinical entities through primary health-care services for early detection and management. Regular monitoring of the prevalence of obesity and diabetes should be instituted as part of routine NCD surveillance.Chapter 7. Global target 7 91Th e agenda for attaining this target could imple- ment and evaluate the following: multisectoral population-based policies to infl u- ence production, marketing and consumption of healthy foods; fi scal policies to increase the availability and consumption of healthy food and reduce con- sumption of unhealthy ones; promotion of breast feeding and healthy com- plementary feeding according to WHO recom- mendations (12); policies and interventions to attain the target on reducing physical inactivity; education and social marketing campaigns focused on impacting dietary and physical activ- ity behaviour in both children and adults; implementation of restrictions on marketing of foods and beverages that are high in sugar, salt and fat to children; measures to create healthy eating environments in settings (schools, workplaces, universities, reli- gious settings, villages, cities) and communities, including disadvantaged communities; research to generate evidence on the eff ectiveness of individual and population-wide interventions to prevent and control obesity and diabetes. To be eff ective, proposed actions need to be spe- cifi c to the country or region and should take into account the available resources and the cultural and ethnic diff erences. It is important to make decisions regarding policy options and priority areas locally, and to engage all relevant stakeholders. WHO has developed a tool to identify and prioritize childhood obesity-prevention policies and interventions ( 48).References 1. Lim SS, Vos T, Flaxman AD, Danaei G, Shibuya K, Adair-Rohani H et al.

Cardiovascular disease was the leading cause of NCD deaths in 2012 and was responsible for 17.5 million deaths. Heart attacks and strokes can be prevented if high-risk individuals are detected early and treated. A very cost-eff ective intervention, which can be implemented in primary care even in resource-constrained settings, is available for prevention of heart attacks and strokes. Prevention of heart attacks and strokes through a total cardiovascular risk approach is more cost-eff ective than treatment decisions based on individual risk factor thresholds only, and should be part of the basic benefi ts package for pursuing universal health coverage. Integrated programmes based on a total-risk approach need to be established in primary care, using hypertension, diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors as entry points. Achieving this target requires strengthening of the key components of the health system including sustainable health-care fi nancing, to ensure access to basic health technologies and essential NCD medicines. Th e attainment of this target will contribute to attainment of the target on reducing premature mortality from NCDs.Key points95Cardiovascular disease: heart disease and stroke Of the 17 .5 million deaths due to cardiovascular disease in 2012, an estimated 7.4 million were due to heart attacks (ischaemic heart disease) and 6.7 million were due to strokes ( 1). Over the last four decades, the rate of death from cardiovascular diseases has declined in high-income countries, owing to reductions in cardiovascular risk factors and better management of cardiovascular disease ( 2). Recent studies indicate that, although the risk-factor burden is lower in low-income countries, the rates of major cardiovascular disease and death are substantially higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries ( 3). Currently, over 80% of cardiovascular deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. In 2012, heart disease and stroke were among the top three causes of years of life lost due to premature mortality globally ( 4). Th e current high rates of premature cardiovascular death are unacceptable because very cost-eff ective interventions are available to prevent heart disease and stroke ( 57). Th e target to reduce heart attacks and strokes aims to improve the coverage of drug treatment and counselling to prevent heart attacks and strokes in people with raised cardiovascular risk and established disease. It is an aff ordable inter- vention that can be delivered through a primary health-care approach, even in resource-constrained settings ( 812 ). What are the cost-e ective policies and interventions to prevent heart attacks and strokes? First heart attacks and strokes can be prevented if high-risk individuals are detected early and treated (6). For eligible persons aged 40-79 years, a regimen of aspirin, statin and two agents to lower blood pressure has been estimated to avert about one fi ft h of cardiovascular deaths, with 56% of deaths averted in people under 70 years ( 13). Th is intervention can be delivered to persons with raised cardiovascular risk (including those with hypertension, diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors with medium-to-high cardiovascular risk) through integrated primary care programmes ( 911 ).8Global target 8: At least 50% of eligible people receive drug therapy and counselling (including glycaemic control) to prevent heart attacks and strokesGlobal status report on NCDs 2014 96Fig. 8.1 WHO/ISH risk prediction chart Age (years)Male FemaleSBP (mm Hg) Non-smoker Smoker Non-smoker Smoker 70180 160 140 120 60180 160 140 120 50180 160 140 120 40180 160 140 120 45678 45678 45678 45678 Cholesterol (mmol/l) An approach that addresses total cardiovascular risk is more cost eff ective than approaches that make treatment decisions based on individual risk-factor thresholds only (e.g. hypertension, hypercholestero- laemia) ( 6,9). A total-risk approach recommended by WHO enables integrated management of hyperten- sion, diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors in primary care, and targets available resources at persons most likely to develop heart attacks, strokes and diabetes complications ( 10,11 ). In addition to fi rst attacks, recurrent heart attacks and strokes also need to be prevented in those with established disease (secondary prevention). Th ese persons face considerably greater risk of recurrent vascular events and are much more likely to die in a recurrent event. Aspirin, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, together with smoking cessation, could prevent up to three quarters of recurrent heart attacks and strokes ( 7). However, a sole focus on secondary prevention is insuffi cient to attain this target, as a considerable number of heart attacks and strokes are fi rst attacks and many persons do not survive the fi rst attack, particularly in low- and middle-income countries with weak emergency health services. It has been proposed that administration of a fi xed-dose combination of aspirin, statin and anti- hypertensive medications (polypill) to all individuals aged over 55 years, regardless of cardiovascular risk status, is a suitable approach for preventing heart attacks and strokes ( 14). However, there is no defi nite evidence to support such mass drug treatment, and the effi cacy, long-term risks, sustainability and cost eff ectiveness of the polypill remain to be proven. Overall, results of clinical trials conducted to date show that fi xed-dose combination therapy is asso- ciated with modest increases in adverse events, but better adherence to treatment, compared to multiple single agents ( 15). As yet, there are no clinical trials with any fi xed-dose combinations that are powered to show diff erences in morbidity and mortality. Fur- ther research, including cost-eff ectiveness studies, is necessary before considering widespread use of fi xed-dose combinations. Furthermore, the use of a Chapter 8. Global target 8 97polypill should not undermine comprehensive public health approaches to NCD prevention and control, or eff orts to strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries. Monitoring coverage to prevent heart attacks and strokes Th e indicator for monitoring this target in the global monitoring framework ( 12, see Annex 1 ) is the proportion of eligible persons receiving drug therapy and counselling (including glycaemic con- trol) to prevent heart attacks and strokes. Eligible persons are those aged 40 years and older with a 10-year cardiovascular disease risk 30% (based on WHO/ISH risk-prediction charts, see Fig 8.1), including those with existing cardiovascular disease. Drug therapy is defi ned as taking medica- tions for primary and secondary prevention of heart attacks and strokes, based on WHO recommenda- tions ( 6,7,9,10 ). Th is includes medications for con- trolling diabetes, hypertension, blood cholesterol and blood coagulation, based on WHO recommenda- tions. Counselling is defi ned as receiving advice from a doctor or other health worker to quit using tobacco or not start, reduce salt in the diet, eat at least fi ve servings of fruit and/or vegetables per day, reduce fat in the diet, start or do more physical activity, main- tain a healthy body weight, or lose weight. Data on monitoring coverage of this essential health service should be gathered from a population-based (pref- erably nationally representative) multiple risk factor survey, that also records the history of cardiovascular disease, and counselling and drug therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk including the use of statins. Progress achieved In the global capacity assessment survey conducted in 2013, 85% of countries reported off ering risk-fac- tor and disease management in their primary health- care systems ( 16). Low-income countries were less likely to have these services at the primary care level. Overall, 94% of countries indicated that they were able to screen for diabetes, with 92% having staff gen- erally available to do the testing, but the availability of tests and staff was low in low-income countries. For instance, while 80% of all countries reported having tests and procedures to assay cholesterol, only 34% of low-income countries reported having these available, compared to 77% of lower-middle-income countries and 100% of high-income countries. While the majority of countries (76%) reported having guidelines for management of cardiovascular dis-ease, only about one third reported having fully implemented the guidelines. More detailed studies reveal significant gaps in the provision of interventions to prevent heart attacks and stroke, even in high-income countries. In a study conducted in 22 European countries, the proportion of patients with heart disease and preva- lent diabetes reaching the treatment targets was 20% for blood pressure, 53% for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and 22% for haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (17). In another European study on secondary pre- vention and risk-factor control in patients aft er isch- aemic stroke, 50% of patients did not achieve opti- mal risk-factor targets ( 18). Not surprisingly, a much worse situation has been documented in low- and middle-income countries ( 19,20 ). In one study, the percentage of those with heart attacks who received beta-blockers was 48%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 40%, and statins only 21% ( 19). In a more recent study in three countries in South- East Asia, over 80% of patients received no eff ective drug treatment aft er heart attacks and strokes ( 20). Poor access to basic services in primary care, lack of aff ordability of laboratory tests and medicines, inappropriate patterns of clinical practice, and poor adherence to treatment were some of the main rea-sons for the treatment gaps. In low- and middle-income countries, the primary care level of the health system, which has to play a critical role in delivering these interventions, is oft en the weakest. An evaluation of the capacity of primary care facilities to implement interventions to prevent heart attacks, strokes and other NCD complications in eight low- and middle-income countries showed major defi cits in health fi nancing, service delivery, access to basic technologies and medicines, medical Global status report on NCDs 2014 98Box 8.1 Phased scale-up of total-risk approach for prevention of heart attacks and strokes in primary care In order to attain this health-system target on prevention of heart attacks and strokes, several low- and middle-income countries (e.g. Bahrain, Benin, Bhutan, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Guinea, Indonesia, Kiribati, Kyrgyzstan, Le-banon, Myanmar, Philippines, Republic of Moldova, Samoa, Sierra Leone, Solomon islands, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tajikistan, Togo, Tonga, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam) have taken steps to strengthen pri-mary care for integration of NCD services. They have assessed the capacity of primary care for implementing a total-risk approach. Pri-mary care workers, including family practitioners, are being trained to assess and manage cardiovascular risk, using tools of the WHO Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settings (22). Some countries have planned national scale-up through a phased approach, as outlined below: Phase 1: Conduct situation analysis Create a conducive policy environment: include prevention of heart attacks and strokes through the total-risk approach in the essential services package and set national targets Phase 2: Address key gaps and strengthen the health system as far as possiblePhase 3: Achieve optimum NCD care within the constraints of the situation Estimate the cost of scale-up and track resources Identify/correct missed opportunities Integrate vertical disease-speci c primary care programmes (e.g. on hypertension, diabetes) Phase 4: Systematic scale-up and monitoring Strengthen supply and quality of services, with emphasis on primary care Improve demand for primary care Find innovative solutions to overcome barriers to improving supply and demand Monitor performance and progress towards attaining the target Sources: see references ( 22-25,32 ). information systems, and the health workforce ( 21). Overall, in most low- and middle-income countries, coverage of this essential individual intervention for prevention of heart attacks and strokes is low, with very slow progress in scaling up. However, as many country examples demonstrate (see Boxes 8.18.4 ), if there is suffi cient political commitment and sus- tainable action, the current situation can be changed gradually, by strengthening the health system, with a special focus on primary care. Actions required to attain this target A comprehensive set of policy options for attaining this target is listed under objective 4 (Strengthen and orient health systems to address the prevention and control of NCDs) of the Global NCD Action Plan ( 5). Many challenges need to be overcome in implementing these policy options. One challenge is to give priority and wider coverage to this very cost-eff ective high-impact NCD intervention (\"best buy\"), in moving towards universal health coverage. A second is to address health-system gaps through mechanisms that are sensitive to specifi c contexts. A third is to develop innovative approaches to expand coverage and track progress as health sys- tems gain capacity in service delivery. Informed decisions need to be made about the sequence of action and the pace at which services are expanded, on the basis of a situation analysis.Chapter 8. Global target 8 99Box 8.2 High-level commitment to strengthen primary care for prevention of heart attacks and strokes in Paci c Island countries At a joint meeting in July 2014, Economic and Health Ministers of Paci c Island countries agreed to improve the e ciency and impact of existing health budgets, by reallocating scarce health resources to targeted pri-mary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, including implementation of WHO PEN ( 22).

Box 8.3 Health-system strengthening to improve NCD outcomes: Bahrain, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Philippines Bahrain's ministry of health has taken steps to improve NCD services through a primary health-care approach. In line with the protocols of WHO PEN ( 22), primary care clinics have been strengthened to address NCDs. The clinics are run by teams consisting of a certi ed family physician, a trained NCD nurse and a health educator. Clinics cover a wide range of activities, including assessment of risk factors, early detection and management of NCDs and complications, and provision of counselling on diet, physical activity, weight control, smoking cessation and self-care. This approach has improved cove-rage of key NCD interventions and patient satisfaction. The ministry of health of the Palestinian Authority adopted WHO PEN ( 22), in an attempt to move away from a vertical approach. The programme has been piloted in two districts in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Reviews have included a register review, clinical audit and sta satisfaction surveys, and routine service data have been used to engage sta in analysing trends and quality of performance. Results indicate that on-site training, backed with regular structured supervision and clinical audits, are key elements in improving the quality of care and promo-ting a sense of accountability. In Pateros, Metro Manila, Philippines, key activities to introduce the WHO PEN package ( 22) have been implemented, including: baseline assessment of capacity, consultation with stakeholders, procurement of essential technologies and medicines, training of health-care pro-viders and computerization of the health information system. Car-diovascular risk assessment has been integrated with other public health programmes. The referral system has been strengthened by involving referral doctors during training and drafting a referral pro-tocol. High-visibility NCD days were organized by community health volunteers, to improve community awareness of the availability of services and to promote compliance. Sources: see references ( 22,24,25 ). Give priority to attaining this target in moving towards universal health coverage Attainment of this target requires priority to be accorded to the prevention of heart attacks and strokes, along the route to attaining universal health coverage. Many low- and middle-income countries are making progress in advancing the universal health coverage agenda (see Box 8.5 ). Th ey are increasingly recognizing that NCD pro- grammes that are focused on inpatient care may neither fully protect against fi nancial risk nor cover services that improve health cost eff ectively, and that coverage of essential interventions in primary Global status report on NCDs 2014 100Box 8.4. Expansion of access to primary health care in Brazil Progress on prevention and control of NCDs reported from Brazil can be ascri- bed largely to political commitment, a focus on social determinants of health, implementation of a comprehensive national health system with strong social participation, and expansion of access to primary health care. Age-adjusted NCD mortality is falling by 1.8% per year, with declines primarily for cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases. The prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and obesity, however, is rising, owing to unfavourable changes in diet and physical activity. Source: see reference ( 26). Box 8.5 Coverage of NCD services in the context of progressive realization of universal health coverage Some low- and middle-income countries are making progress towards providing the entire population with universal access to a bene t package that includes essential NCD interventions. Other countries have introduced reforms to expand health insurance coverage to include essential NCD services. Di erent approaches are used for raising prepaid revenues, pooling risk, and purchasing services. Progress can be seen in increasing enrolment in govern-ment health insurance, a movement towards expanded bene ts packages, and decreasing out-of-pocket spending, accompanied by an increasing government share of spending on health. Source: see reference ( 27,32 ). care will yield greater impacts on population health than inpatient services. Various pathways for achieving universal health coverage have been described ( 28,29 ). Cov- erage of the entire population defi ned set of very cost-eff ective high-impact interventions - addressing NCDs, injuries, infectious diseases, and maternal and child health - could be the fi rst step. To attain the target, this publicly fi nanced basic benefi t package must include very cost-ef- fective interventions, namely prevention of heart attacks and strokes through a total-risk approach (10,11 ). A more advanced approach could provide an expanded package of interventions, such as the expanded list of cost-eff ective interventions in the Global NCD Action Plan ( 5) (see Appen- dix 3 of the plan). Th is second package could be fi nanced through a broader range of traditional and innovative fi nancing mechanisms, including general taxation revenue, payroll taxes, mandatory premiums and co-payments. Exempting the poor (at least those earning less than US$ 1.25 a day) from contributing to both packages should be con- sidered, not only because health is a human right but also because it is a smart approach to equitable distribution of national wealth. Address gaps and reorient health systems to address noncommunicable diseases As alluded to above, context-specifi c strategies will be required to address multiple gaps in health sys- tems related to fi nancing, access to basic technol- ogies and medicines, the health workforce, service delivery, health information and referral. Special attention should be given to strengthening primary care coverage and improving the quality of services at primary level. Health workers require training in assessing and managing total cardiovascular risk, based on evidence-based clinical protocols and risk-assessment tools, and using hypertension and Chapter 8. Global target 8 101diabetes as entry points ( 9,10). A comprehensive approach is required to increase staffi ng ratios, shift certain NCD tasks to lower cadres, and improve the performance of health workers in general practice and family medicine, to address NCDs. Essential technologies (e.g. accurate devices for blood pres- sure measurement, risk-assessment charts, weigh- ing scales, height measuring equipment, blood sugar and blood cholesterol measurement devices with strips, and urine strips for albumin assay) and, medicines (e.g. at least aspirin, a statin, a thi- azide diuretics, an angiotensin-converting a beta-blocker, metformin and insulin ) have to be available and aff ordable. Eff orts are required to make progress on attaining the NCD target, on availability and aff ordability of these, and other essential NCD medicines and basic technologies (see Chapter 9 ). Adherence to simplifi ed guidelines, evidence-based port ( 10,11,30 ) needs to be ensured. Health-information and referral systems require strengthening, to improve follow-up of patients, to monitor inequalities, and to coordinate between health-care providers, primary care facilities and secondary and tertiary hospitals. Learning lessons from experience, innovation and adaptation, to resource limitations Systematic screening for total cardiovascular risk (including hypertension, diabetes and other risk factors), with access to diagnosis and treatment, can advance progress towards attaining this tar-get. Targeted screening for total cardiovascular risk, with blood glucose testing and blood pressure and blood cholesterol measurement, is more cost eff ective than screening the whole population, and is more likely to identify individuals at high car- diovascular risk, for lower cost ( 31). WHO tools are available to estimate the costs of widening coverage; the rate of expansion can be adjusted according to the availability of resources ( 11). Th e quality of services provided, particularly in primary care, requires monitoring. Pay-for-per- formance programmes have been adopted by policy-makers and service providers, to improve the quality of health care, including for NCDs. However, studies that have directly examined the impact of fi nancial incentives on improving health- care processes and outcomes have reported mixed results. Th e role of provider and patient incentives in improving quality of care and clinical outcomes in persons with raised cardiovascular risk needs to be explored and evaluated. A structured and standardized external audit process could be important for monitoring the expanding role of primary care in preventing heart attacks, strokes and complications of dia-betes. Audits of primary care centres to analyse databases on coverage of essential NCD interven- tions, together with review of physical conditions of the premises and of referral links and patient records chosen at random, could provide useful information for developing context-specifi c solu- tions to defi ciencies in service delivery. Facility-level quality-improvement audits carried out by primary care teams could also gather information for team- based analysis of performance problems and joint solutions to problems.Global status report on NCDs 2014 102References 1.

Th e national health strategy should include access to health technologies and essential medicines as an objective and should specify a mechanism for monitoring, evaluation and review of the availability and aff ordability of basic health technologies and NCD medicines. Achieving this target requires sustainable health-care fi nancing, to ensure adequate procurement of basic health technologies and essential NCD medicines. Country eff orts to improve access should fi rst focus on basic health technologies and essential medicines for NCDs, and the national essential medicines list should be the basis for procurement, reimbursement and training of health-care workers. Reliable procurement and distri bution systems are needed to guarantee the supply of essential NCD medicines and technologies to all levels of health care, including primary care, and to regional and remote communities. Mechanisms must be in place to ensure that quality-assured generic medicines are procured; prescribers and consumers need to have confi dence in the generic medicines in circulation. Evidence-based treatment guidelines and protocols should be promoted and implemented, to support the appropriate use of essential NCD medicines. Th e attainment of this target will contribute to attainment of targets on reducing the prevalence of hypertension, on improving coverage of treatment for prevention of heart attacks and strokes and, ultimately, on reducing premature mortality from NCDs.Key points105Availability and a ordability of basic technologies and medicines Eff ective delivery of individual interventions for NCDs requires strengthening of the health system at all levels of care. Weaknesses and ineffi ciencies are currently encountered in all components of health systems, including supply of essential med- icines and technologies ( 14). Priority actions for addressing the NCD crisis include delivering cost-eff ective and aff ordable essential medicines and technologies for all priority disorders, and strengthening health systems to provide patient-centred care across diff erent levels of the health system, starting with primary care ( 4,5). Th is target includes the basic requirement of medicines and technologies for implementing cost-eff ective primary care interventions and for addressing car- diovascular disease, diabetes and asthma ( 6). Th e core essential medicines include at least aspirin, a statin, an angiotensin-converting enzyme insulin, a bronchodilator and a steroid inhalant. Th e basic technologies include, at least, a blood pressure measurement device, a weighing scale, height measuring equipment, blood sugar and blood cholesterol measurement devices with strips, and urine strips for albumin assay. Th ese are minimum requirements for implementing essential NCD interventions in primary care. Availability is defi ned as the percentage of public and private primary health-care facilities that have all of these medicines and technologies, indicated above. Cancer medicines are not included in this indicator because of the diffi culty of implementing treatment interventions for cancer in primary care in resource-con- strained settings. However, this should not undermine eff orts to improve access to essential medicines for treating cancer. Treatment interventions and protocols for cancer should be identifi ed, specifying the level of care at which these cancer medicines can be safely administered. Progress achieved Substantial information exists on availability and aff ordability of essential medi- cines, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. A large number of country studies have been conducted using a standard validated methodology developed by 9Global target 9: An 80% availability of the affordable basic technologies and essential medicines, including generics, required to treat majo r nonc ommunicab le diseases in both public and private facilitiesGlobal status report on NCDs 2014 106WHO and Health Action International (HAI) ( 7). Th e availability and prices of medicines are inves- tigated through visits to public and private-sector facilities in each country, and availability is reported as the percentage of facilities where a product is found on the day of data collection. A summary of the results of medicine-availability studies conducted between 2007 and 2012 using WHO/HAI survey methods is shown in Fig. 9.1 (8). Th ere is a consistent pattern of lower availability of medicines in public sector facilities compared to the private sector, and lower availability in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. While the bas- ket of medicines surveyed in each country is not the same, the basket of medicines in each case is a mix of medicines used to treat communicable diseases and NCDs, as well as to provide symptomatic and pain relief.Further analysis of these WHO/HAI studies in 40 low- and middle-income countries has compared the availability of 15 medicines used for acute Fig. 9.1 Median availability of selected lowest-priced generic medicines, in the public and private sector, by World Bank income group, 20072012 \u2014 median 100 Action International, using data from medicine price and availability surveys conducted between 2007 and 2012 using the WHO/HAI methodology (http://www.haiweb.org/medicineprices). n = number of countries.

Th ese summary measures across a selection of 15 medicines conceal the extent of some of the prob- lems of availability of specifi c medicines for the prevention and treatment of NCDs. An analysis of the availability of selected cardiovas- cular medicines (atenolol, captopril, losartan and nifedipine) in 36 countries concluded that availabil- ity in the public sector was poor (26.3%) compared to the private sector (57.3%) ( 10). A survey of the availability of asthma medicines listed on the WHO model list of essential medicines (11) found that, while salbutamol inhalers were available in 82.4% of private pharmacies, 54.8% of national procurement centres and 56.3% of public hospitals, the availability of beclometasone 100 g puff inhalers, a cornerstone of the management of asthma, was much lower (41.7%, 17.5% and 18.8% respectively) ( 12).Chapter 9.

Access to insulin is problematic in many countries, complicated by the cost of syringes and diagnostic tools for initial diagnosis and follow-up that are essential for monitoring and adjusting treatment (13). Gaps in availability and aff ordability of basic technologies and medicines are particularly severe at the primary care level ( 14) and are major barriers to implementation of essential NCD interventions. Th e results of these studies demonstrate the lower availability of key NCD medicines in the public sector. Th e consequence is that patients are forced to obtain medicines in the private sector, where prices are generally higher and may be unaff ordable for many. WHO/HAI surveys have also addressed the prices patients must pay for medicines and whether these are aff ordable ( 8). Th e measurement of aff ord- ability is not straightforward ( 15). Th e approach used in the WHO/HAI surveys is to use the salary of the lowest-paid unskilled government worker to establish the number of days' wages needed to pur- chase courses of treatment for common conditions. Because chronic diseases need ongoing treatment, the aff ordability of a 30-day supply of medicines is used to indicate monthly medicine expenditures. Data from WHO/HAI surveys between 2007 and 2012 ( 8) were used to compare the aff ordability of two medicines used in managing NCDs - salbu- tamol inhaler 100 g per dose for asthma (assum- ing one inhaler per month) and captopril tablets for hypertension (assuming 25 mg twice daily per month). Th e results (see Fig. 9.2 ) illustrate wide variability between studies. If one day's salary is deemed a measure of aff ordability of a medicine, then, in many cases, medicines are unaff ordable. Th e situation is oft en worse in countries where a large proportion of the population earns much less than the lowest-paid government worker. Monitoring the availability and a ordability of basic technologies and essential medicines Th e indicator for monitoring this target in the global monitoring framework (see Annex 1 ) is the availability and aff ordability of quality safe and effi - cacious essential noncommunicable disease medi- cines, including generics and basic technologies in both public and private facilities. Many countries have already collected ad hoc facility-based information about prices and availability, using the WHO/HAI methodology (8,9). However, assessing progress towards targets requires regular measurement and the collection of valid and reliable data. Routine monitoring systems should be estab- lished, in order to provide regular facility-based assessments of the availability of key medicines and health technologies. Th ese systems need to provide information from the public and private sectors and from urban and rural locations, so that equity of access to these essential commodities can be assessed. For routine monitoring to be feasible, data Global status report on NCDs 2014 108Fig. 9.2 Number of days' wages needed by the lowest-paid unskilled government worker to pay for 30 days' treatment for hypertension and asthma, private sector, 2007-2012 Q Captopril tablets* Q Salbutamol inhaler* Republic of Moldova OB Afghanistan LPG Afghanistan OB United Republic of Tanzania LPG Iran (Islamic Republic of) China (e) LPG China (e) OB India (d) LPG Oman LPG Bolivia (Plurinational State of) OB Bolivia (Plurinational State of) Nicaragua LPG Congo LPG Congo OB LPG Mauritius OB Colombia LPG Colombia OB Haiti LPG Haiti OB Russian Federation (c) LPG Russian Federation (c) OB Ecuador LPG Ecuador OB Brazil (b) OB Mexico (a) LPG Kyrgyzstan OB Kyrgyzstan LPG Indonesia OB Burkina Faso LPG Burkina Faso OB Sao Tom\u00e9 and Principe OB Democratic Republic of the Congo LPG Democratic Republic of the Congo OB Number of days' wages**30 25 20 15 10 5 0***35 Source: World Health Organization/Health Action International, using data from medicine price and availability surveys conducted betwee n 2007 and 2012 using the WHO/HAI methodology (http://www.haiweb.org/medicineprices).

Global target 9 109collection needs to be simple, focusing on a smaller number of key medicines and adding minimal cost to the health system. Th is monitoring is important, not only to assess progress towards the target of 80% availability, but also to identify potential prob- lems in procurement and in-country distribution of medicines and to develop interventions to address any system failures identifi ed. WHO's Service Availability and Readiness Assess- ment (SARA) is another mechanism for assessing the availability of key medicines and health commodities (16). Th is extensive survey uses statistically represen- tative samples of country health facilities. Analyses are stratifi ed by location (urban, rural) and facility type (dispensary, clinic, health centre, hospital), allowing detailed assessment of in-country diff er- ences in medicines availability. However, the scope of SARAs and the large numbers of health facilities surveyed make these surveys resource intensive and expensive. To date, SARAs have largely been con- ducted in Africa and, where SARA data exist, they should be used to inform decision-making and to identify areas where interventions are required to improve access to medicines. Assessing the aff ordability of medicines requires regular measurement of the prices patients must pay for medicines in both public and private sec-tors. Aff ordability can be computed by using the daily wage of the lowest-paid unskilled government worker for each country and the cost of a year's supply of medicines. In measuring aff ordability, financing arrangements for medicines in each country may need to be considered. Some countries may make medicines freely available in the public sector or have health insurance systems in place. Th e out-of-pocket costs for NCD medicines should be monitored. It is also important to consider those who are unable to access care or purchase medicines. House- hold surveys remain an important tool for under- standing the sources of care in the community and the barriers to accessing care and treatments, including essential NCD medicines and health technologies. WHO has standardized methods for conducting household surveys to measure access to and use of medicines ( 17).Actions required to attain this target Commitment to this target, and regular public reporting of progress - regionally, nationally and globally - will hold governments accountable for meaningful progress in improving access to, and affordability of, essential NCD medicines and health technologies ( 18). Health-care nancing Achieving this target requires adequate and sus- tainable health-care fi nancing. Th e ministry of health has a pivotal role in promoting access to quality-assured, affordable essential medicines and should work with the ministry of fi nance to secure adequate funding for health care in general, and essential NCD medicines and technologies in particular. Regulatory systems Strong regulatory systems are necessary to ensure the availability of quality-assured NCD medicines. Eff ective regulatory authority performance requires an appropriate legislative framework, commitment to good governance, administrative structures sup- ported by technical capacity, and political commit- ment to enforce compliance with established norms and standards for manufacture, distribution and supply of medicines and health technologies. Th e aff ordability of NCD medicines for both government and patients depends heavily on the use of generic products. Policies that promote the use of aff ordable generic medicines are important, as is ensuring the quality of generic medicines in circulation in the country. Quality-assurance sys- tems and educational campaigns promoting the use of generic medicines are needed to reassure prescribers, patients and consumers that low price does not mean inferior medicines. Rational selection and use In addition, there should be rational selection of cost-eff ective NCD essential medicines and tech- nologies, effi eff ective procurement and distribution systems for quality-assured products, Global status report on NCDs 2014 110and implementation of evidence-based guidelines to support rational use of these medicines and tech- nologies at all levels of care. Th ese essential medi- cines should be available at the primary health-care level. While treatment may be initiated at higher levels of health care, patients need easy access to these medicines if they are to adhere to long-term treatment regimens. Eff orts to improve the availability of quality-as- sured products in the market should be supported by programmes to promote their use. Th e evi- dence-based treatment guidelines and protocols for primary care should be disseminated and imple- mented ( 6,19). Relatively little is known of rational use of medicines and adherence of prescribing to national treatment protocols in the private sector, so this is an important area for further research. While attention oft en focuses on procurement, sup- ply, availability and pricing measures for essential medicines (supply side), rational use of medicines is critical to cost-eff ective and appropriate use. Health-care professionals and consumers need accurate information on medicines. Setting-spe-cifi c studies are required to understand why pre- scribers and consumers choose particular medi- cines (demand side) and to assess the adherence of prescribing practices to evidence-based treatment guidelines. Procurement systems and pricing policies Along with eff ective and effi cient procurement systems, pricing policies can promote aff ordable access to treatment. Countries need to consider regulation of the mark-ups and fees in the pharma- ceutical supply chain, not only for distributors and wholesalers but also for retail outlets. Supported by policies to allow generic substitution, dispensing fees should encourage the use of low-price generic medicines. Tax exemptions or reductions can be considered - particularly for essential medicines and health technologies - to enhance the aff ord- ability of medicines for consumers ( 20). Multi-stakeholder action Local stakeholders in the pharmaceutical sector include the pharmaceutical industry, health-care professionals and civil society. Th e pharmaceutical industry has the responsibility to produce and sup- ply medicines, including those for NCDs, meeting appropriate standards of quality, promoting use in line with marketing approval, and providing balanced and truthful information to health- care professionals. Health-care professionals have responsibility for the optimal care of patients and for judicious use of scarce resources in managing them. Medicines must be prescribed appropriately, in accordance with evidence-based treatment pro- tocols, and the costs of treatments should be con- sidered. Consumers have a responsibility to use medicines wisely and in accordance with recom- mendations from health-care professionals. In some settings, international stakeholders play an important role in supporting the strengthening of country health systems, through strengthening of drug-manufacturing capacities of countries; training and strengthening of procurement and supply systems; monitoring of prices, availability and aff ordability of medicines; and promoting interventions to improve access. Donations of med- icines must be appropriate, targeted and consistent with WHO guidelines. Medicines benefi t packages must include essential NCD medicines. Countries may require support to develop sustainable fi nanc- ing mechanisms, including targeted subsidies or health insurance systems that ensure aff ordable access to NCD medicines and technologies.Chapter 9.

A national multisectoral NCD action plan with national targets provides the framework for addressing NCDs and their risk factors through a coherent public health approach. Multisectoral action - working together across sectors for the common goal of prevention and control of NCDs - is central to the success of national NCD eff orts and attainment of national targets. Strategic planning requires concrete national targets, with estimates of the health impacts of reaching the targets and the fi nancial resources needed to meet them.Key points113A national multisectoral NCD action plan with national targets A national multisectoral action plan with national targets is a necessary frame- work for addressing NCDs and their risk factors through a public health approach (13). Instead of one plan per disease, a comprehensive NCD plan, with a clear budget and an integrated monitoring framework, makes possible the coherent national policy response required to attain national targets. Where external aid plays a signifi cant role, the NCD action plan is key to aligning external and internal fi nancial and technical inputs to achieve national targets for the prevention and control of NCDs ( 4). In the outcome document of the July 2014 United Nations General Assembly review of NCDs ( 5) and the September 2011 political declaration on NCDs (1), countries committed to strengthening multisectoral policies and plans by 2015 and setting national targets for the prevention and control of NCDs by 2016. As of December 2013, only 43 countries had an operational, integrated, multisectoral national plan consistent with the Global NCD Action Plan 2013-2020 ( 2,6). All countries need to develop, update and implement multisectoral action plans with national targets and prioritize attainment of them by 2025. Why are national targets a priority? National targets, consistent with voluntary global targets, help to focus action on achieving a defi ned impact in key areas for NCD prevention and control. National targets must be realistic about what is feasible and what can be achieved in a given national context. Setting targets can help to reinforce political commitment and strategic response and to mobilize resources for the prevention and control of NCDs. Factors that require consideration when setting national targets include: achievability in the epidemiological context of the country; the feasibility of implementing evidence-based interventions to achieve the target; the potential to set a baseline and monitor over time; the estimated size of the population in need; the current baseline levels of exposure to risk;10Development and implementation of national multisectoral action plans to attain national targetsGlobal status report on NCDs 2014 114 the current level of services and potential rate of scale-up if there are additional investments in human resources and infrastructure. Because a combination of preventive and cura- tive interventions is essential to curb the NCD epi- demic, targets for both prevention and treatment should be considered. If reliable current data are lacking, countries can use WHO's comparable esti- mates of data as a starting point (see Annexes 3 and 4). Once national targets are set, the preventive and curative activities discussed in Chapters 19 should be prioritized in the national action plan and resourced for implementation. Countries may adopt all or some of the 25 indi- cators in the global monitoring framework ( 7, see Annex 1 ) and may include others, as appropri- ate, for monitoring the progress of national NCD eff orts. In addition, it would be useful to develop a set of national process indicators to identify and address obstacles to scale-up. Process indicators can be based on critical obstacles that need to be overcome in the implementation of national action plans, such as predictable fi nancing, human-re-source and system constraints, and participation of non-health sectors. What are the key elements of a national multisectoral NCD action plan? When developing a national action plan, atten- tion should be paid to political, technical and Fig. 10.1 Key elements in the development of a national multisectoral NCD action plan Prioritize activities Balanced and evidence based content Resource planning Inclusive process Practicality and reality Building on what is ongoing National Multisectoral NCD Action Plan operational elements that improve the potential for eff ective implementation (see Fig. 10.1 ) (8). Th ese elements are discussed in turn. Inclusive process National NCD action plans are more likely to be implemented eff ectively if they are developed in col- laboration with a full range of partners, both within and outside the health sector, who can signifi cantly contribute to implementation. Th ese include all non-state actors: communities, grass-roots advo-cates, professionals, nongovernmental and civil society organizations, academia, the media and the private sector. Practicality and reality National targets are more likely to be attained if the multisectoral NCD action plan: is developed with full input by those who will implement it; has policies and actions that are compatible with country capacity and resources; has concrete measures for strengthening capacity and resources through mobilization of govern- ment and partners; has policy directions anchored in political and legal commitments that ensure long-term sus- tained eff orts. Building on what is ongoing Th e multisectoral national NCD action plan should be based on the fi ndings of a situation analysis, with Chapter 10. Development and implementation of national multisectoral action plans 115a special focus on the nine areas of the voluntary global targets. Th e results of the situation analysis should be shared with stakeholders, to build con- sensus on both the fi ndings and the approaches to be adopted. Th e situation analysis can be usefully broadened to encompass areas with a bearing on NCD prevention and control, such as primary health-care reforms, moves towards universal health coverage, multisectoral collaboration and the social determinants of health. Prioritize activities It is diffi cult to implement policies and interven- tions to address all NCDs simultaneously, owing to resource constraints. Priority-setting deter- mines which policies and interventions should be addressed fi rst, which may mean that some cur- rent activities should be scaled back to allow for higher-priority activities. For instance, policies and activities on the four major NCDs and their modifi able risk factors need to be addressed fi rst, followed by activities relating to common comor- bidities and other NCDs. Th e main consideration in priority-setting is oft en cost eff ectiveness, but other valid concerns should also be considered, such as equity, avoiding impoverishment due to catastrophic health-care payments, and the capi- tal investment required. A rational, systematic and transparent approach to prioritization can help ensure that the objectives are met as early as possi- ble and that available resources are used effi ciently. Prioritization is needed both at the technical level and geographically. Balanced and evidence-based content Th e national multisectoral NCD action plan should present, in a balanced and coherent manner appro- priate to the country context, the key elements of NCD prevention and control, namely: the vision, principles, goals and national tar- gets, consistent with the Global NCD Action Plan 20132020 (2) and corresponding regional frameworks; policy directions and priority interventions to address: (i) surveillance and monitoring; (ii) prevention, including prevention targets; (iii) health care, including health-system targets; and (iv) leadership and governance arrangements for implementation, including: the roles and responsibilities of institutions and stakeholders; accountability (performance monitoring, out- come measurement, continued improvement in the planning process and timely corrective measures); implementation research and adaptation to changing circumstances; regulatory and legal frameworks to ensure sustainability; collaboration with other sectors to ensure that health is taken into consideration in all policies; links with the donor community, as appropriate. Resource planning The multisectoral NCD action plan should be linked upstream to the national health plan and broader national strategies for development and poverty alleviation, and downstream to subnational operational plans and budgets. Based on available resources, a feasible path needs to be mapped out to take the country from the current position (defi ned in the situation analysis) to the desired objectives (defi ned by priority-setting). Th is requires setting national NCD targets with estimates of the health impacts of reaching the targets and the fi nancial resources needed to meet them. Th e sequence of these elements, and whether they appear in the national NCD action plan or other planning documents, depends on the country context. In principle, the full range of issues should be covered. Key steps in development of a national multisectoral NCD action plan Th e development of a national multisectoral NCD action plan involves several steps (see Fig. 10.2 ), as detailed next.Global status report on NCDs 2014 1161. Advocate for placing NCD prevention and con- trol high on the political agenda, and obtain explicit government commitment and resources for development and implementation of the action plan. 2.

Share the results of the situation analysis with stakeholders, and together identify barriers and pragmatic solutions. 5. Conduct consultations, as appropriate, with internal and external stakeholders and expert groups, to identify priority policies and inter- ventions, national targets for 2025 based on the voluntary global targets (2), roles and respon- sibilities of diff erent stakeholders, the cost of implementation of the action plan, and resource gaps. 6. Prepare a draft national action plan, dissem- inate it to all stakeholders, obtain input and revise it. 7. Obtain offi cial endorsement of the document action plan.Chapter 10. Development and implementation of national multisectoral action plans 117Key domains of a national multisectoral NCD action plan In addition to the elements and steps already described, a technically sound NCD action plan includes several thematic domains. By grouping them into domains - i.e. governance, prevention, health care, and surveillance and monitoring - activ- ities can be organized and rendered coherent and mutually reinforcing. Th is comprehensive approach is necessary for programmatic, administrative, eco- nomic, technical and ethical reasons ( 13,9 ). Governance Governance mechanisms and structures, with strong leadership, clear reporting lines and full government involvement, are key to coordination of the implementation of the national action plan, in order to build human, fi nancial and regulatory capacity, and to promote multisectoral partnerships and accountability for enforcement strategies, mon- itoring and evaluation. Accountability involves budget allocation, assessing the performance of other stakeholders (United Nations agencies, civil society, academia, donors and the corporate sector), tracking resources, measuring results, engaging in transparent review, and taking remedial action as necessary. A menu of policy options for strengthening accountabil-ity and capacity for accountability can be found under objective 2 of the Global NCD Action Plan 20132020 ( 2). Strategic actions include: developing a national multisectoral NCD action plan with national targets and a monitoring framework consistent with the Global NCD Action Plan 20132020 (2); ensuring that the national multisectoral NCD action plan is harmonized with national health and development plans; tracking total health expenditure and expend- iture on prevention and control of NCDs by fi nancing source; establishing a high-level commission/mechanism for engagement, policy coherence and mutual accountability of diff erent areas of policy-making that have a bearing on prevention and control of NCDs; strengthening the capacity of the public health workforce and public health organizations to per- form the functions required for accountability; systematically enforcing evidence-based legisla- tion, regulations and fi scal policies; mobilizing United Nations country teams to strengthen links between NCD strategies and those for universal health coverage, addressing social determinants of health and sustainable development; integrating strategies into the design and imple- mentation of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (10). Prevention Th e objective of NCD prevention is to reduce expo- sure of the population to NCD risk factors and underlying social determinants of those risk factors (1,2,9 ). Supportive environments that protect health and promote healthy behaviour can be created if existing public health policies and tools to address risk factors are implemented within the framework of the national multisectoral action plan. Appropriate policies are required to reduce exposure to modifi able NCD risk factors includes: increase public awareness of behavioural risk factors and their impact on health; address aff ordability, availability and access, through fi scal policies (taxes and price adjust- ments), production policies (agriculture and manufacture) and access policies; denormalize and treat unhealthy behaviours. Adequate investment and appropriate incentives and disincentives are required to enforce regula- tion, fi scal measures and laws. Responsibilities for creating environments conducive to health go beyond the traditional health sector to many other sectors, and include local government, municipali- ties, schools, workplaces and businesses. A menu of policy options for strengthen- ing population-wide prevention can be found Global status report on NCDs 2014 118under objective 3 of the Global NCD Action Plan 20132020 ( 2). Strategic actions include: implementing policy options to reduce exposure to risk factors in order to make progress towards national targets, giving priority to very cost-ef- fective interventions (see Box 1.1 ); taking measures to reduce inequalities in the social and physical environment (e.g. access to healthy foods, walking paths and cycle tracks, smoke-free environments, job opportunities and education), in order to reduce behavioural risk factors and other health determinants; establishing a multi-stakeholder and intersec- toral group, including representatives of the executive, legislative and judiciary authorities, to implement population-wide prevention policies; establishing multisectoral partnerships, giving due consideration to non-state actors; identifying, publicizing and addressing interfer- ence by commercial entities, particularly those associated with tobacco, alcohol, non-alcoholic beverages and unhealthy foods. Health care People need access to a health system that prevents, detects and treats NCDs eff ectively through pri- mary health care, in the context of universal health coverage. Health systems require strengthening and should move towards universal health coverage, to ensure that people do not fall into poverty because of the cost of health services. Effi ciency should be improved at all levels of care, with a special focus on primary care. A menu of policy options for strengthening health systems can be found under objective 4 of the Global NCD Action Plan 20132020 (2). Strategic actions include: incorporating prevention and control of NCDs in efforts to move towards universal health coverage; providing fi nancial support for the phased imple- mentation of a package of cost-eff ective essential NCD interventions, with a special focus on vul- nerable populations; strengthening all components of the health sys- tem for screening, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, self-care and palliative care, with an emphasis on primary health care and access to essential medicines and basic technologies; increasing domestic investment in health and establishing viable health-fi nancing mechanisms, including innovative fi nancing approaches (e.g. tobacco and alcohol taxation). Surveillance and monitoring Surveillance and monitoring measure progress and provide the basis for accountability of stakeholders, including governments' commitments to their pop- ulations. Underinvestment in health information systems has left gaps in data collection, analysis and the use of data for public health decision-making. Countries should establish a harmonized system for generating national NCD-relevant health infor- mation: vital registration, risk factor and disease surveillance and response, service statistics, and health management and fi nancial information. In addition, assessment of health equity requires measurement of changes over time in disparities in health status, health care, and the physical and social determinants of health. A menu of policy options for strengthening sur- veillance and monitoring can be found under objec- tive 6 of the Global NCD Action Plan 20132020 ( 2). Strategic actions include: setting national targets, consistent with global targets, according to national circumstances; developing and institutionalizing surveillance, monitoring and health information systems, to track trends in risk factors and assess progress in implementing policies, strategies and interventions; using indicators of the global monitoring frame- work, disaggregated for sex and other equity considerations, to monitor progress towards the 2025 targets; strengthening a national civil registration system for registration of births, deaths and causes of death;Chapter 10. Development and implementation of national multisectoral action plans 119 developing and maintaining disease registries, particularly for cancer; undertaking periodic data collection on the key behavioural and metabolic risk factors and other determinants, and contributing data on a routine basis to assist with monitoring the global status of NCDs; mobilizing information and communication technologies to support national health infor- mation systems; strengthening technical and institutional capac- ity to manage and implement NCD surveillance and monitoring systems integrated into health information systems. Implementation of the national multisectoral NCD action plan Implementation of the national NCD action plan requires: Human resources and institutions that are capa- ble of designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating appropriate policies ; effective management of public expenditure across all levels of government; suffi cient implementation capacity; strategic planning; a sound fi scal policy (to ensure sustainability). Given the importance of taking local needs, capacities and challenges into account in the devel- opment and implementation of the action plan, a blueprint approach is unlikely to help. In most settings, and especially in resource-constrained environments, an incremental approach is required - i.e. starting with priority actions to attain national targets in each domain. Th e actions chosen should be based on a realistic assessment of current capac- ities and a clear vision for the future. Th ere is a solid case for tackling NCDs from the perspective of health and development. How- ever, if governments are to draw more heavily on Figure 10.3 Schematic representation of the modular structure of the OneHealth Tool ( 12) Considering costs within an envelope of Financial a ordabilityStrenghtening health systemsLives saved; healthier populationsNational Hospital Health centre Outreach Community Immunization Water and sanitation Reproductive health Malaria Child health Tuberculosis HIV Nutrition NCDs Infrastructure Human resources Supply chain Health informationGovernance Health nancingIncreasing coverage of e ective interventions OthersGlobal status report on NCDs 2014 120stretched budgets to invest in combating NCDs, the approaches they choose must off er compelling value for money. Low- and middle-income countries will need to increase spending, in order to expand the scope of health services to include, at a minimum, very cost-eff ective NCD interventions (\"best-buys\"; see Box 1.1 ). Th ese interventions should be imple- mented in every setting, as soon as possible, in order to save lives, prevent disease and reduce costs to the health system. However, cost-eff ectiveness data alone will not be suffi cient to operationalize the national NCD action plan. Countries also need a clear vision, supported by robust strategic planning, in order to evaluate which approaches they should invest in, how much they will cost, and what the health impact of diff erent approaches will be. WHO has estimated that some US$ 170 billion is required to bring \"best-buy\" NCD interventions to scale in all low- and middle-income countries over the period 20112025 (equivalent to US$ 13 per capita) (11). What is now required is an understand- ing of how the costs of scaling up NCD approaches match the realities of country resources and the capacity of health-care systems. Th e United Nations' OneHealth Tool is soft ware designed to cost policy scenarios at country level, to strengthen health-system analysis (see Fig. 10.3 ) (12). Th e OneHealth Tool is intended to inform the development of national strategic health plans by assessing cost, impact and fi nancial parameters for strengthening health systems and meeting health needs in low- and middle-income countries. Th e tool encompasses the four building blocks of a national action plan: governance, prevention, treatment and care, and surveillance and monitoring ( 12). Th e purpose of the OneHealth Tool is to enable natio nal p lanners to make inf o rmed decisio ns about feasible goals over the next 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. Th e tool explicitly takes account of existing infrastructure, human resources and fi nances, to help establish realistic scale-up targets and identify bottlenecks. Intervention-specifi c delivery costs are based on the population served, while health-sys- tem costing is based on geographical area or pop- ulation-level norms.The key strength of the OneHealth Tool is its ability to pull diff erent programmatic areas together and to generate a consolidated analysis across health-system, health-impact and nancial space. At the same time, realistic planning needs to take health-system capacity into account. Scaling up services by a factor of 50%, or even by 10% over the next 510 years, may require investments in the medicines supply chain, health worker availability and deployment, and the establishment of manage- ment and supervisory processes.Chapter 10.

Th e commitments include setting national targets and developing national multisectoral plans to achieve those targets by 2015, imple- menting policies and interventions to reduce NCD risk factors and underlying social determinants, and orienting health systems to address NCDs through peo- ple-centred primary health care and universal health coverage by 2016. Th e key messages of the report and proposed actions are to be tailored to each country, according to context. Th e preceding chapters discussed cost-eff ective ways of using available resources to attain the nine global NCD targets, even in limited-resource settings. Guidance is provided on the nine voluntary global targets and on cost-eff ective interventions required to attain them (see Chapters 19 ). Th e development of national multisec- toral action plans to provide integrated public health frameworks for implementing the interventions is discussed in Chapter 10. Th e report also provides 2010 estimates of country-specifi c NCD mortality and risk factors, which will be used as the baseline for reporting on progress in attaining the national targets, starting in 2015. Th is fi nal chapter highlights the 7 key messages of this report (See Box 11.1 ), and overarching actions and accountability required to make progress in attain- ing the nine voluntary global targets and national targets by 2025.

Th e burden of death and disease is heavily concentrated in the world's poorest countries. Death and disease due to NCDs matter in their own right, but they also act as important barriers to poverty reduction and sustainable development. Beyond the direct impact of ill-health on household living standards through out-of-pocket expenditures, the impact of NCDs on adults of productive age indirectly aff ects national income through reduced productivity and a reduction in the number of hours that people can engage in work. Prevention and control of NCDs contribute to many of the sustainable development goals ( 2). Proposed actions Advocate at global, regional and national levels for a strong position to be accorded to NCDs within the sustainable development goals framework. Embed indicators of prevention and control of NCDs within the sustainable development goals accountability framework.Table 11.1 Status of implementation of the Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 20132020 ( 3), based on results of the 2013 NCD country capacity survey ( 4) Process indicatorsNumber of countries Countries with at least one operational multisectoral national policy, strategy or action plan that integrates several NCD and shared risk factors in conformity with the global and regional NCD action plans 2013-2020 70 Countries that have operational NCD unit(s)/branch(es)/department(s) within the ministry of health or equivalent 167 Countries with an operational policy, strategy or action plan to reduce harmful use of alcohol within the national context 52 Countries with an operational policy, strategy or action plan to reduce physical inactivity and/or promote physical activity 56 Countries with an operational policy, strategy or action plan to reduce the burden of tobacco use in line with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control 69 Countries with an operational policy, strategy or action plan to reduce unhealthy diet and/or promote healthy diets 60 Countries with evidence-based national guidelines/protocols/standards for management of major NCDs through a primary care approach recognized/approved by government or competent authorities 64 Countries with an operational national policy and plan on NCD-related research, including community-based research and evaluation of the impact of interventions and policies Data not yet available Countries with NCD surveillance and monitoring systems that enable reporting against the nine voluntary global NCD targets 42Chapter 11. The way forward to attain NCD targets: key messages 125 Integrate NCDs into national health plans and national development plans. Message 2: While some countries are making progress, the majority are o course to meet the global NCD targets A certain amount of progress has been made in addressing NCDs since the adoption of the Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the [United Nations] General Assembly in 2011 ( 3). However, progress remains uneven and the response does not match growing needs, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. As the recent NCD country capacity survey indicates (see Table 11.1 ), there are many missed opportunities to strengthen governance, preven- tion, health care, and surveillance and monitoring (4). Urgent action is required to address the gaps in these key NCD domains. Proposed actions Develop or update national multisectoral NCD action plans, consistent with the Global NCD Action Plan ( 5) and regional NCD frameworks. Align international cooperation on NCDs with national multisectoral NCD action plans, in order to strengthen aid eff ectiveness and the development impact of external resources. Message 3: Countries can move from political commitment to action by prioritizing high-impact, a ordable interventions Th e available cost-eff ective, high-impact interven- tions constitute a powerful arsenal for prevention and control of NCDs. As the full benefi t of many NCD interventions can be reaped only over decades, the time-lag may make them less popular with poli- ticians who focus on short-term political cycles and favour rapid unsustainable interventions. Available resources need to be used strategically to improve NCD outcomes by investing in very cost-eff ective interventions and policy options to reduce popula- tion exposure to behavioural risk factors - harmful use of alcohol, physical inactivity, tobacco use and high salt consumption. Similarly, it is essential to invest in very cost-eff ective individual interventions to reach people at high risk and those with estab- lished disease. Th e coverage of these interventions has to be scaled up to attain targets. Concurrent research and analysis are needed to ensure lessons learnt from implementation are taken into account in decision-making, to enable mid-course corrections. Proposed actions Intensify eff orts to track fi nancial resources for NCD prevention and control. Produce high-quality case-studies to better understand why progress has not been made. Give priority to implementation of very cost-ef- fective population-wide and individual interven- tions (\"best buys\", see Box 1.1 ), to attain targets Support and facilitate research related to imple- mentation and its translation into practice, in order to enhance the knowledge base for country action. Message 4: All countries need to set national NCD targets and be accountable for attaining them Th e nine voluntary global targets identify priority areas in prevention and control of NCDs. Together with the Global NCD Action Plan 20132020 ( 5), they give a clear indication of where the world should be in 2025 in relation to NCDs. Th is report presents policy options and interventions to attain the NCD targets in countries at all levels of eco-nomic development and at diff erent stages of the NCD epidemic. National targets help to garner political support and facilitate benchmarking and monitoring of results. Because the targets focus on a limited set of key NCD outcomes, monitoring of Global status report on NCDs 2014 126progress towards the targets shows what is achiev- able and where faster progress can be made with limited resources. Furthermore, focusing attention on national progress using disaggregated data col- lection, as measured by the monitoring framework, helps countries to consider whether the benefi ts of progress are distributed equitably. Proposed actions Set national targets, consistent with global tar- gets - as discussed in this report - and monitor progress towards their attainment. Contribute information on NCD mortality and risk factors to WHO, for global analyses. Message 5: Structures and processes for multisectoral and intersectoral collaboration need to be established Collaboration across sectors outside health (mul- tisectoral collaboration) and between government and non-state actors (intersectoral collaboration) is key to equitable prevention and control of NCDs and to attaining national targets. Mechanisms for multisectoral and intersectoral collaboration need to be embedded in the planning stage of NCD programmes, and should continue through imple- mentation, enactment of public policies and mon- itoring and evaluation. A high-level, multisectoral structure may be created, with broad representation or with a specifi c health focus - such as to curb childhood obesity, encourage healthy urban plan- ning, promote physical activity, or improve access to medicines and technologies. Multisectoral action for prevention and control of NCDs can be facili- tated using the key components of the Health in all policies (HiAP) framework for country action (6). Proposed action Establish a high-level commission/mechanism and an accountability framework to strengthen multisectoral and intersectoral collaboration, to support prevention and control of NCDs.Message 6: Investment in health systems is critical for improving NCD outcomes NCDs require continuity of long-term care rather than the episodic treatment of acute incidences that characterizes health care in most low- and middle-income countries. Analysis of health sys- tems shows that key elements of the health system - including health financing, governance, the health workforce, health information, medical products and technologies, and health-service delivery - present obstacles to scale-up of NCD care. As discussed in Chapter 8-10, strategizing to overcome these barriers should be a major focus of investment in scaling up NCDs because rolling out even the most basic of interventions will be ham- pered if a functioning health system is not in place. Emerging and expanding universal health coverage schemes provide potential levers to prioritize NCDs while balancing other competing health priorities and health-system objectives. Proposed actions Include NCD interventions in universal health coverage schemes, giving priority to very cost-ef- fective interventions. Use transparent processes to prioritize NCD interventions, based on considerations of health impact, cost eff ectiveness and equity. Provide aff ordable access to essential technol- ogies and medicines for management of NCDs Identify and address health-system barriers to NCD care, with a special focus on strengthening patient centered primary health care. Message 7: Institutional and human resource capacities and nancial resources for NCD prevention and control require strengthening Attainment of national targets will require institu- tional and human capacity and adequate fi nancial Chapter 11. The way forward to attain NCD targets: key messages 127resources at country level. Establishing public health institutions could help to deal with the com- plexity of issues relating to NCD prevention and control - such as interaction with food and agricul- tural systems, law, trade, urban planning and com- mercial infl uence. Th e competency and capacity of the health workforce will require strengthening to address NCDs, including through incorporation of public health aspects of NCD prevention and control in teaching curricula for medical, nursing and allied health personnel, and provision of in-ser- vice training. Policies and legal frameworks will be required to promote the retention of health workers in rural areas, particularly in primary care. Capac- ity-building is also important for other sectors. For instance, training of food producers, manufactur-ers and caterers, especially those involved in small and medium-sized businesses, is important for the attainment of targets 4 and 7. Training inspectors to enforce smoke-free and drinking-driving policies is a strategic component of interventions to attain targets related to tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. Proposed action Implement policy options to strengthen national capacity and the competence of human resources for the prevention and control of NCDs proposed in the Global NCD Action Plan ( 5). Allocate adequate fi nancial resources for NCD prevention and control and, track total health expenditure and expenditure on prevention and control of NCDs by fi nancing source. Prioritize allocation of fi nancial resources for implementation of `best buy` interventions and policies to attain national NCD targets. WHO's role in prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases As the principal international agency for health, WHO will continue to play a key role in prevention and control of NCDs. It will continue its eff orts to implement the Global NCD Action Plan 20132020 (5), operating at global, regional and country levels, including through the United Nations Interagency Task Force and the innovative global mechanism that has been set up to improve coordination ( 7,8). WHO's regional committees for Africa, the Amer- icas, South East Asia, Europe, Eastern Mediterra- nean and the Western Pacifi c have adopted regional policy frameworks ( 914 ) consistent with the Global NCD Action Plan ( 5), to further advance ongoing work (see Box 11.2 ). Key areas of continuing action include setting norms and standards, providing technical support to Member States to strengthen national capacity, strategic planning and resource tracking, and global coordination and monitoring. Arrangements to meet country needs and support national eff orts through bilateral and multilateral channels will be strengthened further. As NCDs are one of the leadership priorities within the pro- grammatic reform of WHO, the organization will need to continue to strengthen its support for NCD prevention and control, in order to obtain maxi- mum impact with the limited resources available. Accountability is key for attainment of targets The highest level of political engagement will be required to develop a country framework for accountability. Th is implies the development of transparent processes for monitoring, review and action. At national level, a functioning health infor- mation system that collects, analyses and reports on expenditure and health data, including on indicators of the global monitoring framework, is essential for monitoring progress. Reviews need to be based on evidence gathered through monitor- ing, and should provide feedback on progress as the basis for mutual accountability between gov- ernments and other stakeholders. WHO already has an accountability framework. In 2013, the Sixty-sixth World Health Assembly (in Resolution WHA66.10) requested the Direc-tor-General of WHO to report on progress in attaining the nine voluntary global targets to the Health Assemblies in 2016, 2021 and 2026 ( 15). WHO will invite Member States to contribute data Global status report on NCDs 2014 128Box 11.2 Progress in prevention and control of NCDs in WHO regions since 2011: key milestones, activities and achievements (number of countries/territories are shown in parentheses) African Region National NCD reporting systems were integrated into health management information systems (n=33).

The way forward to attain NCD targets: key messages 129South-East Asia Region NCDs were recognized as a major priority in all 11 countries. National targets were set in Bangladesh, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Timor Leste, and multisectoral action plans are being developed. The WHO PEN package has been introduced into primary health-care systems in Bhutan, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. Pictorial warnings covering a significant area on tobacco product packages have been implemented in Bangla-desh (50%), India (40%), Indonesia (40%), Thailand (85%) and Nepal (75%). At least one round of an NCD risk factor survey was completed in all countries. In addition to the nine voluntary global targets, the South-East Asia Region has adopted an additional target on reducing household air pollution. Western Pacific Region National multisectoral action plans were developed in Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, China, Malaysia, Mongolia and all Pacific Island countries. STEPS surveys were conducted (n=7), as were global school-based student health surveys (n=11). National targets aligned to the global targets were established in all Pacific Island countries, with the addition of the Tobacco Free Pacific target (5% reduction in tobacco use by 2025). Tobacco control has already yielded results, with 70% of Pacific Island countries meeting the target of a 10% reduction in tobacco prevalence in adults. Salt reduction was initiated in 10 countries. Mongolia has demonstrated a 10% reduction in salt content in bread in a year, and Fiji has shown a 15% reduction in salt for a common brand of noodles. WHO PEN was introduced in Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Philippines, Viet Nam and Pacific Island countries.

All the elements required for mutual account- ability for NCD prevention and control at global and national levels are not in place yet. Th ere are time-bound assignments for WHO and commit-ments by governments on NCD prevention and control. However, there are no commitments as yet by other key stakeholders. Work is in progress to develop an approach that can be used to regis- ter and publish contributions of the private sec-tor, philanthropic entities and civil society to the achievement of the voluntary global targets by 2015. Recognizing the need to continue to strengthen international cooperation in the prevention and control of NCDs, Ministers committed themselves in the 2014 Outcome Document ( 1), to invite the Development Assistance Committee of the Organi- zation for Economic Cooperation and Development to consider developing a purpose code for NCDs in order to improve tracking of offi cial development assistance in support of national eff orts for the pre- vention and control of NCDs. Accountability of all stakeholders will be central for the attainment of global and national NCD targets.References 1.

Countries will select indicator(s) of harmful use as appropriate to national context and in line with WHO's global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol and that may include prevalence of heavy episodic drinking , total alcohol per capita consumption, and alcohol-related morbidity and mortality among others. 2. In WHO's global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol the concept of the harmful use of alcohol encompasses the drin king that causes detri- mental health and social consequences for the drinker, the people around the drinker and society at large, as well as the patte rns of drinking that are associated with increased risk of adverse health outcomes. 3. WHO's recommendation is less than 5 grams of salt or 2 grams of sodium per person per day.4. Countries will select indicator(s) appropriate to national context.5. Individual fatty acids within the broad classi cation of saturated fatty acids have unique biological properties and health e ects that can have rele- vance in developing dietary recommendations.Global status report on NCDs 2014 136137Annex 2. Methods used for estimating the NCD mortality and risk factor data Th e mortality and risk factor data presented in this report were estimated by WHO and collaborating partners using standard methods to maximize cross-country comparability. Th ey are not neces- sarily the offi cial statistics of Member States. Mortality Age- and sex-specifi c all-cause mortality rates were estimated for 2000-2012 from revised life tables, published in World Health Statistics 2014 ( 1). Total number of deaths by age and sex were estimated for each country by applying these death rates to the estimated resident populations prepared by the United Nations Population Division in its 2012 revi- sion ( 2). Causes of death were estimated for 2000-2012 using data sources and methods that were spe- cifi c for each cause of death ( 3). Vital registration systems which record deaths with suffi cient com- pleteness and quality of cause of death information were used as the preferred data source. Mortality by cause was estimated for all Member States with a population greater than 250,000. Th ese NCD mortality estimates are based on a combination of country life tables, cause of death models, regional cause of death patterns, and WHO and UNAIDS programme estimates for some major causes of death (not including NCDs). Detailed information on methods for mortality and causes of death esti-mates were published previously ( 3). Age-standardized death rates for cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes were calculated using the WHO standard population ( 4). Proportional mortality (% of total deaths, all ages, and of both sexes) for communica- ble, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions; injuries; chronic respiratory diabetes; and other NCDs is reported for 2012 ( 5). Th e 2012 probability of dying between ages 30 and 70 years from the four main NCDs was esti- mated using age-specifi c death rates (in 5-year age groups, e.g. 30-34... 65-69, for those between 30 and 70) of the combined four main NCD categories, for each Member State (5). Using the life table method, the risk of death between the exact ages of 30 and 70, from any of the four causes and in the absence of other causes of death, was calculated using the equation below. Th e ICD ( 5*Mx) were fi rst calculated: Total deaths from four NCD causes between exact age x and exact age x+5 5*Mx = Total population between exact age x and exact age x+5 For each fi ve-year age group, the probability of death from the four NCDs (5*qx) was calculated using the following formula: 5*Mx 5 5*qx = 1 + 5*Mx 2.5 Th e unconditional probability of death, for the 30-70 age range, was calculated last: 65 40*q30 = 1 - (1 - 5*qx) x=30 Metabolic/biological risk factors Estimates for metabolic/biological risk factors (BMI, overweight and obesity, blood glucose/diabetes and blood pressure) were produced for the standard year 2010 to serve as baselines for reporting against the NCD global voluntary targets, and for the year 2014. Th e crude adjusted estimates in Annex 4 are based on aggregated data provided to WHO and Global Global status report on NCDs 2014 138Burden of Metabolic Risk Factors of Chronic Dis- eases Collaborating Group and obtained through a review of published and unpublished literature. Th e inclusion criteria for estimation analysis included data that had come from a random sample of the general population, with clearly indicated survey methods (including sample sizes) and risk factor defi nitions. Using regression modeling techniques , adjustments were made for the following factors so that the same indicator could be reported for a standard year (in this case 2010 and 2014) in all countries: standard risk factor defi nition, standard set of age groups for reporting; standard reporting year, and representativeness of population. Crude adjusted rates and age-standardized comparable estimates were produced. Th is was done by adjust- ing the crude age-specifi c estimates to the WHO Standard Population ( 4) that refl ects the global age and sex structure. Th is adjusts for the diff erences in age/sex structure between countries. Uncertainty in estimates was analysed by taking into account sam- pling error and uncertainty due to statistical mod- eling. Th e estimates included in the WHO Regional groupings and World Bank Income groupings are the age-standardized comparable estimates. Data reported as of October 2014 were included in the estimation process. Further detailed information on the methods and data sources used to produce these estimates is available from WHO. Th e following risk factor indicators, with defi - nitions, were included: Prevalence of raised blood pressure among per- sons aged 18+ years (defi ned as systolic blood pressure 1 40 mmHg and/ or diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg) Prevalence of raised blood glucose/diabetes among persons aged 18+ years (defi ned as fast- ing plasma glucose concentration 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) or on medication for raised blood glucose or with a history of diagnosis of diabetes) Mean Body Mass Index (BMI). Prevalence of overweight and obesity in persons aged 18+ years (defined as body mass index 25 kg/m\u00b2) Prevalence of obesity in persons aged 18+ years (defi ned as body mass index 30 kg/m\u00b2) Physical inactivity Estimates for adult prevalence of insufficient physical activity were produced by WHO for the standard year 2010. Insuffi cient physical activity was defi ned as the percentage of adults aged 18+ years not meeting the WHO recommendations on Physical Activity for Health ( 6), which is, doing less than 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week, or equivalent. Prevalence of insuffi cient phys- ical activity was estimated from population-based surveys meeting the following criteria: (i) provide survey data for the defi nition of doing less than 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week (or equivalent), or doing less than 5 times 30 minutes of moderate physical activity per week (or equivalent); (ii) survey data cover all domains of life, includ- ing work/household, transport and leisure time; (iii) include randomly selected participants of the general population who were representative of the national or a defi ned subnational population; (iv) present prevalence by age and sex, with a sample size of each sex-age group of at least a sample size of 50 participants. Countries with no surveys were excluded from the analysis. Regression models were applied to adjust for the defi nition (for those coun- tries where only the defi nition of doing less than 5 times 30 minutes of moderate physical activity per week (or equivalent) was available), for survey coverage (for those countries where only urban data was available), and to estimate missing age groups (for those countries where data did not cover the full age range). To further enable comparison among countries, age-standardized comparable estimates of insufficient physical activity were produced. Th is was done by adjusting the crude estimates to the WHO Standard Population ( 4) that closely refl ects the age and sex structure of most low and middle income countries. Th is corrects for the diff erences in age/sex structure between countries. Uncertainty in estimates was analysed by taking into account sampling error and uncertainty due to statistical modeling. Th e estimates included in the WHO Regional groupings and World Bank Income 139Annex 2. groupings are the age-standardized comparable estimates. Data reported as of October 2014 were included in the estimation process. Further detailed information on the methods and data sources used to produce these estimates is available from WHO. Th e following risk factor indicator, with defi ni- tion, was included: Prevalence of insufficiently physically active persons aged 18+ years (defi ned as less than 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, or equivalent) Tobacco smoking A statistical model based on a negative binomial regression was used to estimate the prevalence of tobacco smoking using information from coun- try surveys available in WHO. Tobacco smoking includes cigarettes, cigars, pipes, hookah, shisha, water-pipe and any other form of smoked tobacco. National surveys that report tobacco prevalence and were completed in countries from 1990 up to 30 June 2014 were used for the estimation. An important limitation of the data is that information on tobacco use in a country may be collected from various surveys that may have dif- ferent primary uses and at times diff erent methods of collecting the information. Th e model applies several adjustments to try to overcome these lim- itations. Where survey data are missing for any age group, the model uses data from the country's other surveys to estimate the age pattern of tobacco use. For ages that the country has never surveyed, the average age pattern seen in countries in the same geographical region is applied to the country's data. Th e model adjusts for diff ering defi nitions of tobacco use (for example, current versus daily use, or tobacco smoking versus cigarette smoking) using available data from the country's other sur- veys to gauge the relationship between indicators of tobacco use by age and sex and over time and derives likely values for the missing indicators. For tobacco use indicators that the country has never reported, the average relationships seen in countries in the same geographical region are applied to the country's data. Despite best eff orts to generate estimates for countries, this is not always possible and there are some countries with insuffi cient survey data (whether no surveys, or too few or too old) to cal- culate a contemporary time point estimate. Th e outputs from the model are tobacco smok- ing prevalence estimates with 95% confidence intervals, as well as age-specifi c rates by sex. Th e 2012 age-specifi c rates were applied to the World Standard population to produce age-standardised smoking rates for WHO Regions and World Bank grouping of countries into High, Middle and Low income countries. 1 Th e WHO Standard Population is a fi ctitious population whose age distribution is largely refl ective of the global population age struc- ture. Th e age-standardized rates are hypothetical numbers which are only meaningful when com- paring standardized rates from one country with standardized rates from another country. Further detailed information on the methods and data sources used to produce these estimates is available from WHO. Harmful use of alcohol Total alcohol per capita (15+ years) consumption, in litres of pure alcohol, 2010 [95% CI] Th e recorded three-year average APC for 2008-2010 and the unrecorded consumption for 2010 were added to arrive at the total consumption in litres of pure alcohol ( 7). Th e comparison of this total with the weighted average of the total consumption for each region is shown in the country profi le. For male and female per capita consumption, we used proportion of alcohol consumed by men versus women plus the demographics for 2010. 1. Geographic regions as defi ned by UN sub-regions ; please refer to pages ix to xiii of World Population Prospects: Th e 2010 Revi- sion published by the UN Department of Economic and Social Aff airs in 2011 at http://esa.un.org/wpp/Documentation/pdf/ WPP2010_Volume-I_Comprehensive-Tables.pdf . Please note that, for the purposes of this analysis, the Eastern Africa subre-gion was divided into two regions: Eastern Africa Islands and Remainder of Eastern Africa; and the Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia subregions were combined on 2014 140Recorded APC (three-year average): Using the recorded APC data from 2008, 2009 and 2010, three-year averages were computed. Tourist con- sumption was removed to provide a better estimate for APC in countries with at least as many tourists as inhabitants. Th e tourist consumption estimates are based on the following assumptions: i) Tourists/ visitors consume alcohol as they do at home (i.e. with the same average alcohol per capita consump- tion); ii) Th e average length of stay by tourists/visi- tors was 14 days (except for Estonia, Luxembourg, and the Republic of Moldova, where there is a lot of cross-border shopping with shorter average length of stay). Recorded APC is defined as the recorded amount of alcohol consumed per capita (15+ years) over a calendar year in a country, in litres of pure alcohol. Th e indicator only takes into account the consumption which is recorded from production, import, export, and sales data oft en via taxation. Recorded APC is calculated as the sum of bever-age-specifi c alcohol consumption of pure alcohol (beer, wine, spirits, other). Th e \"other alcoholic bev- erages\" category consists of such types as fortifi ed wine, fermented beverages, sorghum, maize, and ready-to-drink. Th e fi rst priority in data sources is given to government statistics; second are coun- try-specifi c alcohol industry statistics (Canadean, IWSR -International Wine and Spirit Research, OIV-International Organisation of Vine and Wine, Wine Institute, historically World Drink Trends) in the public domain if based on interviews in coun- tries; third is the Food and Agriculture Organi- zation of the United Nations' statistical database (FAOSTAT); and fourth is economic operators if desk review. In order to make the conversion into litres of pure alcohol, the alcohol content (% alco- hol by volume) is considered to be as follows: Beer (barley beer 5%), Wine (grape wine 12%; spirits spirit-like (sorghum, millet, maize beers 5%; fortifi ed wine 17% in litres of pure alcohol in 2010 was based on empirical investigations and the judgement of experts. A special exercise to collect in-depth information on unrecorded alcohol from all venues (i.e., cross-bor- der shopping, surrogate alcohol use, illegal and legal home production, smuggling) was conducted to improve the accuracy of unrecorded data. Total alcohol per capita (15+ years) consumption, in litres of pure alcohol, projected estimates for 2012 [95% CI] Projected estimates for total alcohol consumption data for 2012 took into account data that were avail- able for that year for some countries. For other coun- tries, they were derived using fractional polynomial regression models with year as independent variable. As data on per capita consumption change rapidly over time, the regression model for each country was chosen based on the results of regression models that used data from 2005 onward, 2000 onward, 1990 onward, and 1960 onward. Models were cho- sen based on a sensitivity analysis that assessed the ability of these models to predict data from 2005 onward when these data were excluded (models were adjusted to use data from 2000 onward, 1995 onward, 1985 onward, and 1960 onward respectively for the sensitivity analyses). Age-standardized heavy episodic drinking (15+ years, population), past 30 days (%), 2010 [95% CI] Th e number of males in the population multiplied by the percentage of heavy drinkers in the popula- tion. Th e number of male heavy drinkers divided by the number of male drinkers equals the percent- age of male heavy episodic drinkers among male drinkers. Similar calculations are done for HED among females and the total population. Surveys carried out in the time period 2006-2010. HED is defi ned as having consumed at least 60 grams or more of pure alcohol on at least one occasion in the past 30 days. Values for countries with no available surveys were imputed via multiple regression based on region, year of survey, per capita consumption, pattern of drinking score, demographic indicators (including religion) and economic wealth (GDP- PPP) as predictors.141Annex 2. Age-standardized alcohol use disorders (15+ years), 12 month prevalence (%), 2010 [95% CI] Data on the prevalence of people with AUD (includ- ing harmful use and alcohol dependence), were modelled using regression models. Where available, the original survey data on the previously-men- tioned measures of interest were used instead of the predicted estimates. Th e regression models used data collected through a systematic search of all survey data on the previously-mentioned measures of interest (from 2000 onward) and took into account per capita consumption, population structure, the size of Muslim population within the country, the region of the country, and the year from which the survey data were obtained. Data on gross domestic product (adjusted for purchase power parity) were obtained from the World Bank (World Bank, 2013). Th e validity of the predicted estimates was assessed by comparing predicted estimates to the survey data.References: 1. World Health Organization. World Health Statistics 2014. Geneva: WHO; 2014. 2.
