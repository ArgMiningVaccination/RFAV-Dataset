Position description The University of California, Irvine (UCI) invites inquiries, nominations, and applications for an endowed chair in integrative oncology in the Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute (SSIHI), Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (CFCCC), and the School of Medicine. The endowed chair will be a collaborative and transformative leader, bridging numerous facets of the UCI enterprise to drive advancements in evidence-based approaches to integrative oncology that have a profound impact on patient care and outcomes. Housed in the Division of Oncology and the Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute, the endowed chair in integrative oncology will build upon the innovative work at UCI in integrative health, promoting broad partnerships and collaborative research within the UCI Health enterprise, with other University schools and departments, and with national cooperative group and industry research partners. This novel and expansive view of integrative oncology represents new horizons and potential around patient care, treatment, and outcomes. The endowed chair will have the unique opportunity to capitalize on UCI's commitment to and strength in integrative health and be at the forefront of developments that will significantly impact and improve the lives of patients. Further reflecting UCI's ongoing and substantial investment in integrative health, the endowed chair in integrative oncology will be one of several faculty supported by endowed chairs across medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and population health to join the community in the coming years. Applicants should have an exemplary track record of evidence-based clinical practice and investigation focused on improving health and wellness through understanding biological effects of, and/or have experience in translational and clinical studies of complementary health interventions in patients with cancer. Experience within a health system of integrative, collaborative, patient-centered care that uses complementary therapies, including mind-body therapies, natural health products, and lifestyle in conjunction with medical treatment to enhance treatment efficacy, improve symptom control, and alleviate distress and suffering of patients with cancer is preferred. The ability to communicate with and coordinate patient care with other members of the care team, including medical oncology, radiation oncology, and surgical specialties, will be an essential requirement to excel in this role. As an academic health system, our mission also includes healthcare education, and therefore engagement of faculty in the area of integrative medicine in medical school education, residency and fellowship programs is also encouraged. Examples of relevant areas of investigation include: Biological effects and mechanisms of action underlying complementary and whole-person health approaches in cancer management; Studies intended to identify and validate objective endpoints or biomarkers, assess and measure adherence or treatment fidelity, and otherwise strengthen the design of subsequent clinical trials of complementary and whole-person health approaches in cancer care; Quality studies of the contribution to improved health and wellness made by complementary and whole-person health interventions. These would include, but not be limited to, investigations of the impact of complementary and whole-person health modalities, including diet and exercise, nutritional supplements, acupuncture, mind-body, and interventions in integrative oncology; Research studies and clinical trials to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of integrative oncology therapies; Medical research demonstrating the health- and cost- effectiveness of integrative oncology care. Successful candidates will receive Endowed Chair Funds, and those who also qualify for a ladder-rank faculty appointment will have a University FTE. The Endowed Chair will be reviewed after 5 years for renewal. Applicants must have an MD, MD/PhD, PhD, DO, or equivalent and are required to have post-graduate training in disciplines involved with cancer care (medical, surgical, radiation oncology, etc).
