The ayahuasca diet is a set of restrictions implemented for a period of time before drinking [ayahuasca](https://www.newlifeayahuasca.com/ayahuasca). The diet is not just about avoiding certain foods but is about discipline, sacrifice, and commitment. The ayahuasca diet restrictions are in place to help cleanse the body and the spirit so the plant medicine can work most efficiently. We ask our participants to engage in mindful eating. This means bringing awareness to what you eat, how often you eat, and why you eat. In the western world, we often rely on eating takeout, at restaurants, or prepackaged meals. Try to make healthier decisions and eat primarily whole foods. FOODS TO ENJOY Fruits and vegetables Rice, bread, and pasta Nuts and grains Chicken or fish Beans and legumes Greens FOODS TO AVOID Red meat Dairy Spicy food We let each guest choose their own level of dedication and rigidness they apply to follow the ayahuasca diet. If you try to follow all the diet regulations you find online, you're left with almost nothing to eat, so don't make yourself crazy. Moderate amounts of caffeine (including coffee), salt, sugar, oils, and spices are all fine to consume before your retreat. Just eat smart and healthy and you'll be fine. All meals provided at New Life Ayahausca are vegan with gluten-free options and prepared with locally sourced, organic (when possible) fresh fruits and vegetables. DIET VS DIETA There are essentially two separate and independent aspects of the ayahuasca diet that are typically lumped into one general set of regulations. - DIET - The ayahuasca diet is prescribed in regard to food interactions with the MAOIs found in ayahuasca. They include avoidance of foods high in tyramine, a naturally occurring byproduct of the amino acid Tyrosine. MAOIs block monoamine oxidase, which is an enzyme that breaks down excess tyramine in the body. Excessive tyramine can elevate blood pressure and lead to a hypertensive crisis. Aged foods contain the highest level of tyramine, so you want to avoid things like cured meats, aged cheeses, pickled or fermented foods, and alcohol. You would have to eat a lot of foods very high in tyramine for it to reach a dangerous level. - DIETA - A dieta is prescribed by an ayahuasquero or curandero for a specific purpose. Often, it is to heal physical illness. Dietas are also used when learning to work with ayahuasca, to build protection, to develop plant allies, to get rid of negative spirits, and to heal spiritual diseases. The dieta is extremely strict and includes no salt, no oils, no spices, no sugar, no vegetables, no fruits, and no sexual activity. Most often, the dieta consists of rice, potato, and occasionally boiled chicken, plantain or egg. Dietas are often done in isolation and prohibit the use of toothpaste, soaps, deodorant, and shampoos. Dietas also include the use of a master teacher plant in conjunction with ayahuasca.
