GBS was founded by Waldorf-trained teachers and currently operates in San Francisco's Portola neighborhood, serving Preschool through 6th Grade, with 95 students and 25 staff members. The school intends to grow into a full Preschool through 8th Grade school. GBS is taking a fresh look at Waldorf education, asking what the children of today in San Francisco need from teachers and education in general. One major result of this question is the development of a robust outdoor curriculum. Each week, our Kindergarten spends two days in an indoor classroom, one day at our urban farm, and two days hiking in McLaren Park. Our grades classes are indoors for Main Lesson and some subject classes, spending additional days in large outdoor parks, at the school farm, or on field trips. 1st and 2nd grades often spend one full day a week outdoors in San Francisco's parks. We are also dedicated to becoming an anti-racist school - committed to social justice, internally and externally - that is inclusive and welcoming to all. We incorporate both anthroposophy and social justice in our weekly faculty meetings, where we delve deeper into interrupting Euro- and white-centric curriculum to bring equitable teaching practices and anti-racist policies into the classroom and school life. We ask that teachers be interested and on a path of exploring both anthroposophy and social justice. For the 2021-2022 school year we are looking for a Preschool Aftercare Teacher to teach alongside another Preschool Aftercare Teacher, both reporting to the Aftercare Manager. The program will be developed in partnership with the Aftercare Manager and Preschool Teachers.
