I created this quiz as the first step to help you understand the current state of your gut. Take this quiz and start your health and healing journey. Wholistic Nutrition Therapy and Radical Self-Healing for Your Whole Life Every human body is distinctly unique. We each have our own specific physical make-up. When we combine this with the qualities of our living environment (the types of air we breathe and the quality of the water we drink), as well as our emotional landscape (how stressful our work-life balance is, how nourishing our relationships are, how confident we feel in our bodies and within our lives), we each suddenly have our own incredibly distinct nutritional and health blueprint that are unlike anyone else. When you work with me, I utilize whole-body, integrative, wholistic methods rooted in both Western and Eastern practices to help you make healthy and sustainable changes in your life that will both empower and ignite your love of Self.
