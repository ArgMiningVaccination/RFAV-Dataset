On this page: [Statewide vaccination data](#overview) [Vaccination status by Healthy Places Index and other groups](#equity-metric) [Vaccination status by age and race and ethnicity](#age-ethnicity) [Vaccinations by ZIP code](#zip-code) [Explore more data](#more) Changes in Vaccination Data Reporting On June 16, the COVID-19 vaccination reporting system will track only two types of vaccinations-primary series and CDC's new up-to-date measure. See details on the [new CDC measure.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fvaccines%2Fdifferent-vaccines.html) The reporting system will update data monthly, and stop publishing average doses administered and doses on hand. Statewide vaccination data This chart shows all vaccinations administered in California, by county of residence. Vaccination status by Healthy Places Index and other groups This chart shows our progress in vaccinating groups and communities with the most urgent need. You can view by age, race and ethnicity, or Healthy Places Index (HPI), either statewide or by county. This chart uses the Healthy Places Index 3.0 (HPI), developed by the Public Health Alliance of Southern California. The HPI uses a range of data sources and indicators to calculate a measure of community conditions ranging from the most to the least healthy based on economic, housing, and environmental measures. Scores range from less healthy community conditions in Quartile 1 to more healthy community conditions in Quartile 4. Vaccination status by age and race and ethnicity This chart shows vaccinations, for age and demographic groups. Selecting a race and ethnicity updates the line chart, but not the table or bar charts. [Overview of vaccine administration source data](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/vaccine-progress-dashboard). Data is reported weekly. Chart information - This chart includes vaccine doses administered and reported to state immunization registries. The vaccination rates are estimates based on best available information from vaccine records and Census data. These estimates may differ from those provided by local health districts. Local estimates should be considered more accurate. - Rates are capped at 95%. This is consistent with CDC reporting practices. It prevents illogical values (like more than 100%) as a result of data entry issues. - Unvaccinated people have not received any doses of an approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccine. - Primary series refers to people who have completed one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine or two doses of another approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccine. - The definition of \"primary series complete\" has not changed and is based on previous recommendations that CDC has since simplified. A person cannot complete their primary series with a single dose of an updated vaccine. - Approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines include: Moderna, Pfizer, and Novavax. - Up to date is defined using CDC Recommendations: [Stay Up to Date with COVID-19 Vaccines.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fvaccines%2Fdifferent-vaccines.html) - The statewide doses administered include all doses allocated to California as well as the CDC LTC Pharmacy and Retail Pharmacy Partnership Programs, Federal Dialysis Center Program, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) partner sites, and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) partner sites. - This chart does not include all doses for the following federal agencies: Indian Health Service, Veterans Health Administration, Department of Defense, and Federal Bureau of Prisons. Data will be regularly updated due to ongoing statewide vaccine record reconciliation efforts. - This data will be regularly updated due to ongoing statewide vaccine record efforts. Data may differ from those reported by local health districts and federal entities. - Where the county of residence was not reported, the county where vaccinated is used. This applies to less than 1% of vaccination records. - The sum of county-level vaccinations does not equal statewide total vaccinations because some out-of-state residents are vaccinated in California. - Numbers between 1 and 10 are shown as \"<11\" to protect patient privacy. - Percentages are calculated based on population data from the California Department of Finance July 2021 file ( [see methodology.](https://dof.ca.gov/forecasting/demographics/projections/)). These estimates based on the best available information from US Census and state agencies. The percentages reported for each group should be viewed only as estimates based on the most current data available. The number of individuals in each group who have been vaccinated is a precise count, but the population estimates for each group may not reflect the count of current residents due to births, deaths, and migrations. - Percentages by Healthy Places Index quartile are calculated based on population data from American Community Survey 2015-2019. - Vaccination rate estimates for some groups, such as Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander and multi-race populations, may be incomplete due to differences in how demographic data is collected by the Census and at the time of vaccination.
