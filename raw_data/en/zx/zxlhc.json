Crystals are used to interact with your body's energy field, also known as an individual's chakra. We spoke to two industry experts: Liz McCaughey, Psychotherapist, Counsellor & Clinical Supervisor from Hong Kong](https://www.amindset.hk), and Cristina Rodenbeck from [Manipura Wellness](https://manipurawellness.com) about the benefits of healing crystals.

L: Crystals are a conduit for energy that can be utilised for healing, useful for clearing stale energy in your home or workplace, great talismans for helping children and adults sleep, and enhances focus and productivity. C: There are multiple benefits of using crystals, they can help to raise energy in our homes and offices, attract personal and professional wealth, clear energy blockages, ward of negative energy, support health, prevent disease, manifest visions and dreams, forecast the future and help you feel and look fabulous! Is there a correct way of using crystals? C: The best crystal for you at any time depends on what you want to achieve. If you want to bring more love and compassion into your life and relationships, wear Rose Quartz as a pendant near your heart center. If you want to bring more abundance and wealth into your life use Citrine stones as bracelets or rings or place the stones in your office. Or, if you want to work with your body's Chakra system, match the crystals to the Chakras points to increase their energy and support the energy flow in your body. L: We have a natural affinity for crystals that are good for us as individuals. You would likely be uncomfortable working with someone else's crystal or one that doesn't suit you. When you find one you like, there are simple methods of clearing the residual energy from its 'past life' thus being presented with an empty crystal, like a secondhand computer that is wiped clean of information so that you can start afresh. C: Cleanse them with smudging herbs such as White Sage and Palo Santo, as soon as you purchase or receive them. Program them with your intention like love, abundance or protection. Every few weeks, cleanse and charge again. Some crystals love water and the sun, others don't. It's important to learn how to take care of your crystals to extend their life and effectiveness. L: While crystals are essentially quite safe to use intuitively with a good and harmless intent, the combination of a natural healer and a powerful crystal can be quite strong. Some people are very sensitive and can be overwhelmed by an over-enthusiastic healer. More is not always better, and you should avoid mentally 'forcing' the energy. Project your healing and harmless intent and allow the crystal to work and find its own level. "}
