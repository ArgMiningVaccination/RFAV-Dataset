Arrest and detention rates are low and don't deter criminal activity. Criminal groups, including drug cartels, are very active. Clashes between cartels or gangs over territory, drugs and smuggling routes are common. In some parts of the country, military, navy and federal police forces have been deployed to combat organized crime and improve security conditions. They maintain a visible presence by: - patrolling the streets - setting up roadblocks - conducting random vehicle checks If you plan on travelling to Mexico: - remain vigilant at all times - stay in tourist areas - be very cautious on major highways - avoid travelling at night - monitor local media closely If you're the victim of a crime, you must report it immediately to local authorities. No criminal investigation is possible without a formal complaint. Complaints must be made in person before leaving Mexico. You should hire a local lawyer to represent your interests and follow up on your case after you return to Canada. Failure to do may result in incomplete investigations or long delays in bringing cases to trial. Violent crime There are high rates of violent crime, such as homicides, kidnappings, carjacking and assaults, including in popular tourist destinations such as the Mayan Riviera (Canc\u00fan, Playa del Carmen, Puerto Morelos and Tulum), and Acapulco. Criminal groups and drug cartels are present in tourist areas. Inter-gang and cartel fighting has taken place in restaurants, hotels and nightclubs frequented by tourists. Innocent bystanders have been injured or killed. You may be in the wrong place at the wrong time and become a victim of violent crime. Border areas often see higher criminal activity and violence, including in rural areas. Confrontations between organized criminal groups and Mexican authorities continue to pose a risk. Shootouts, attacks and illegal roadblocks may occur without warning. You should travel to Mexico by air to avoid international land border crossings, particularly along the border with the United States, in the following cities: - Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez - Nuevo Laredo - Reynosa If crossing an international land border: - remain extremely vigilant - use only official border crossings - avoid travelling at night Armed robbery Armed robbery occurs. Foreigners have been targets of robberies that sometimes involve assault. Robbers will follow a victim after they exchange or withdraw money at airports, currency exchange bureaus (casas de cambio) or ATMs. - Stay in hotels and resorts with good security - If you are threatened by robbers, stay calm and don't resist - Avoid withdrawing or exchanging money in public areas of the airport Assault Canadian travellers have been physically and sexually assaulted. In some cases, hotel employees, taxi drivers and security personnel at popular tourist destinations were involved. In some cases, hotel staff are not helpful and try to dissuade victims from pursuing the incident with police. - Avoid walking after dark, especially alone - Avoid isolated or deserted areas - Stay in hotels and resorts with good security - Avoid excessive alcohol consumption [Are you a victim of sexual violence?](https://canadainmexico.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SGBV-En-Digital.pdf) - Government of Canada and British Embassy Mexico City Fraud Credit card and ATM fraud Credit card and ATM fraud occurs in Mexico. When using debit or credit cards: - pay careful attention when others are handling your cards - use ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business - avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature - cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN - check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements Overcharging Some bars and nightclubs may try to charge exorbitant prices. Discussions about overcharging may lead to threats of violence and security guards may force you to pay. Avoid running a tab or leaving your credit card with bar or restaurant staff. Extortion Police officers Legitimate police officers have extorted money from tourists or arrested tourists for minor offences such as : - drinking alcohol on the street - urinating on public roads - traffic violations They have requested immediate cash payment in exchange for their release. Travellers driving rental cars have been targeted. If this occurs: - don't hand over your money or your passport - ask for the officer's name, badge and patrol car number - ask for a copy of the written fine, which is payable at a later date, or insist on going to the nearest police station Virtual kidnappings Extortion, including virtual kidnappings, is the third most common crime in Mexico. Criminals use a variety of tactics to gather information about potential victims for extortion purposes, including using social media sites or eavesdropping on conversations In a virtual kidnapping, criminals contact the victim's hotel room landline and threaten the victim to stay in their room. The criminals then instruct the victim to provide information needed for the caller to use to contact family and friends, to demand the immediate payment of ransom for their release. - Don't discuss travel plans, your room number or any other personal information around strangers - Never leave your cellphone unattended - Ensure your cellphone is password protected - Don't divulge personal business details to strangers in person or over the phone or on social media, especially when using hotel phones - If you're threatened on the phone or hear screams, hang up immediately - When you answer the phone, wait for the caller to speak. If the caller asks who is speaking, hang up immediately. - Don't answer unrecognized or blocked phone numbers - Don't answer hotel landlines Kidnappings Mexico has one of the highest kidnapping rates in the world. Kidnapping, including virtual and express kidnapping, is a serious security risk throughout Mexico. Kidnappers target all classes. Canadian citizens and contractors working for Canadian businesses have been kidnapped, mostly in areas that are not under the control of police and security forces. If you're kidnapped: - comply with the kidnappers' requests - don't attempt to resist Express kidnappings Express kidnappings occur in large urban areas. This is a method of abduction where criminals ask for a small and immediate ransom. Thieves most commonly work in cooperation with, or pose as, taxi drivers. They force victims to use their debit or credit card to withdraw money from ATMs in exchange for their release. - Use only a reputable taxi company or a trusted ride-sharing app - Book taxis through your hotel or an authorized taxi stand (sitio) Theft Petty theft Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, is common in Mexico. - Be aware of your surroundings at all times, even in areas normally considered safe - Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times - Avoid showing signs of affluence, such as flashy jewellery, cell phones, headphones and designer bags - Carry only small amounts of money - Be cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs Home break-ins Tourists staying in rental homes have been the victims of break-ins and burglaries. Whether you're staying in private or commercial accommodations, make sure you lock windows and doors securely. Women's safety Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Some incidents of assault, rape and sexual assault against Canadian women have occurred, including at beach resorts and on public buses. - Exercise caution when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances - Be wary of rides or other invitations - Avoid excessive alcohol consumption Spiked food and drinks Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. Unregulated alcohol Some bars, restaurants and resorts have served counterfeit alcohol. Some travellers have reported getting sick or blacking out after drinking alcohol. - Be cautious if you choose to drink alcohol - Seek medical assistance if you begin to feel sick Balconies Height standards for balcony railings in Mexico can be considerably lower than those in Canada. Falls have resulted in deaths and injuries. - Exercise caution when standing close to balcony railings - Avoid excessive alcohol consumption Demonstrations Demonstrations take place regularly throughout the country. Protests and roadblocks are common in: - Mexico City, including to and from the airport - the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, Michoac\u00e1n and Oaxaca Such incidents may last a long time, leading to shortages of fresh food, medicine and gasoline. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. - Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place - Follow the instructions of local authorities - Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations [Mass gatherings (large-scale events)](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings) Water activities Swimming Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year. Many beaches don't offer warnings of dangerous conditions and they don't always have lifeguards on duty. Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards. - Consult local residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas - Always obey warning flags at beaches - Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities Water sports Tour operators may not adhere to international standards. Many operators don't conduct regular safety checks on their sporting and aquatic equipment. Also, Canadians have been involved in accidents where operators of recreational vehicles, such as watercraft, have demanded compensation exceeding the value of the damage caused to the vehicle or equipment. If you undertake water sports, such as diving: - choose a well-established and reputable company that has insurance - ensure that your travel insurance covers the recreational activities you choose - wear the appropriate safety equipment, such as helmets and life jackets - ensure that equipment is available and in good condition - don't consume alcohol before the activity If in doubt concerning the safety of the facilities or equipment, don't use them. Adventure tourism Outdoor activities, such as white water rafting, kayaking, scuba diving, snorkelling, bungee, zip lining, paragliding, hiking, mountain biking, etc and other adventure activities can be dangerous if unprepared. Trails are not always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly, even during summer. Tour operators may not always adhere to international safety standards. If you intend to practice adventure tourism: - never do so alone, and do not part with your tour companions - consider hiring an experienced guide from a reputable company - obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be setting out - buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation - ensure that your physical condition is good enough to tackle the challenges of your activity - know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal - pay attention to the symptoms of dehydration and heatstroke, both of which can be fatal - avoid venturing off marked trails - ensure that you're adequately equipped and bring sufficient water - stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard - refrain from using facilities or equipment if you have doubts on their safety - inform a family member or friend of your itinerary Road travel Road conditions and road safety Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. Road conditions can be dangerous due to: - sharp curves - poorly marked or hidden road signs - construction sites - roaming livestock - slow-moving or abandoned vehicles Toll highways are typically safer and better maintained than secondary highways. Mexican driving styles are very different from those in Canada. Many drivers don't respect traffic laws, and police don't strictly enforce these laws. Drivers often drive at excessive speeds and may be aggressive or reckless. Drinking and driving laws are not strictly enforced. Accidents causing fatalities are common. Police don't regularly patrol the highways. Roadblocks and checkpoints Illegal roadblocks and demonstrations are common. Heavily armed gangs have attacked travellers on intercity highways. Criminals especially target sport utility vehicles and full-size pickup trucks for theft and carjacking. The military searches for drugs and firearms at military checkpoints throughout the country. - Avoid road travel at night between cities throughout the country - Ensure that you only stop in major centres, at reputable hotels or at secure campsites - Keep your car doors locked and the windows closed, especially at traffic lights - Avoid hitchhiking which is not a common practice in Mexico - Don't leave valuables in the vehicle - Rent cars that don't have stickers or other advertisements for the rental company on them, as rental cars have been targets for robbery, sometimes using force - Ensure operators provide insurance and helmets if renting scooters - Travel on toll roads to lower the risk of targeted roadblocks and robberies - Never attempt to cross roadblocks, even if they appear unattended Public transportation Remain vigilant in airports, at bus stations, on buses and on the metro. Metro The Mexico City metro is often very crowded and a popular place for pickpocketing. There are metro cars dedicated to women and children during rush hours. They are located at the front of the trains. Buses The Metrobus in Mexico City, which has dedicated lanes and stops, is relatively safe. There are sections dedicated to women and children at the front of the buses. The \"colectivos\" and \"pesero\" mini-buses that stop when hailed are frequently targeted for robbery. When travelling to other cities, use bus companies that offer VIP or executive class transportation. These buses only travel on toll roads, which lower the risks of targeted roadblocks and robberies, and follow a speed limit. Taxis and ridesharing services Disputes between taxi and ridesharing application drivers may occur, especially in Quintana Roo. They may result in: - blockades - altercations - assaults Although tourists have not been targeted, you may be caught up in these incidents and harassed or injured. In Mexico City, all government-authorized taxis have licence plates starting with \"A\" or \"B.\" Taxis from designated stands have both the logo of their company and the plate number stamped on the side of the car. Official taxis in Mexico City are pink and white. Users can validate the pink and white taxis on the CDMX app. - Avoid hailing taxis on the street - Don't share taxis with strangers When arriving at an airport in Mexico, pre-pay the taxi fare at the airport (inside or outside the terminal) and ask to see the driver's official identification. You can also use a ridesharing app to arrange for a pickup at certain airports. Not all airports in Mexico allow ridesharing service pickups. If you use a trusted ridesharing app, confirm the driver's identity and the licence plate before getting in the car. [Mi Taxi](https://taxi.cdmx.gob.mx/mi-taxi) - CDMX app (in Spanish) Cruise ship travel Plan carefully if you plan to take a cruise departing from or stopping in Mexico.

Pregnant women, children under 5 years of age, those over 60 years of age, and those with weakened immune systems are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill. Cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella have been reported among Canadian travellers returning from Mexico. These strains of Salmonella do not respond to some of the recommended antibiotics if treatment is needed. Most people recover on their own without medical treatment and from proper rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). - Carry [oral rehydration salts](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/rehydration)when travelling. Travellers with severe symptoms should consult a health care professional as soon as possible.

Zika virus [Zika virus](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/zika-virus.html) is a risk in this country. Zika virus is primarily spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can also be sexually transmitted. Zika virus can cause [serious birth defects](https://canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/zika-virus/pregnant-planning-pregnancy.html). Pregnant women and women planning a pregnancy should visit a health care professional before travelling to discuss the potential risks of travelling to this country.

It is caused by a parasite spread by infected triatomine bugs. The infection can be inactive for decades, but humans can eventually develop complications causing disability and even death. Risk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from triatomine bugs, which are active at night, by using mosquito nets if staying in poorly-constructed housing. There is no vaccine available for Chagas disease. Animal precautions Some infections, such as [rabies](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/rabies) and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals. Certain types of activities may increase your chance of contact with animals, such as travelling in rural or forested areas, camping, hiking, and visiting wet markets (places where live animals are slaughtered and sold) or caves. Travellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, livestock (pigs, cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats, and to avoid eating undercooked wild game. Closely supervise children, as they are more likely to come in contact with animals. Person-to-person infections Stay home if you're sick and practise proper [cough and sneeze etiquette](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#hygiene), which includes coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand.

Check with your [local public health authority](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/mpox/symptoms-management.html) pre-travel to determine your eligibility for mpox vaccine. Medical services and facilities The quality of care varies greatly throughout the country. Good health care is available in private hospitals and clinics, but it's generally expensive. Most private facilities won't agree to deal directly with medical insurance companies and will require payment with a credit card in advance or a bank transfer/direct deposit. Mental health services are extremely limited in Mexico, particularly outside of Mexico City. Services and treatment standards may differ substantially from those in Canada. Medical evacuation can be very expensive and you may need it in case of serious illness or injury. Make sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays. Medical tourism Medical tourism is common in Mexico. Canadian travellers have had serious health complications following cosmetic or other elective surgeries abroad. Before leaving for medical travel, you should do your research, especially on: - the health and financial risks - the medical facility where the procedure will be performed - language barriers, which can lead to misunderstandings about your medical care and conditions - travel insurance that includes coverage for the type of medical procedure you will be undergoing You should discuss your medical plans with your primary healthcare provider in Canada before travelling. Most provincial and territorial health care programs are extremely limited in their coverage offered abroad. - Make sure that the healthcare providers you choose are authorized by the Mexican health authorities - Ask to see the credentials of the healthcare providers - Obtain a written agreement detailing the proposed treatment or procedure Useful links [Receiving medical care outside Canada](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/medical-care-outside-canada) [If you become sick or injured while travelling outside Canada or after your return](https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/sick-injured) [Medical tourism](https://www.gob.mx/sectur/acciones-y-programas/sello-turismo-de-salud-turismo-medico)- Government of Mexico (in Spanish) Medication If you take prescription medication, you're responsible for determining their legality in Mexico. - Bring sufficient quantities of your medication with you - Always keep your medication in the original container - Pack your medication in your carry-on luggage - Carry a copy of your prescriptions Medication cannot be sent to Mexico from Canada via courier services.

Death in Mexico If you plan to retire or spend long periods of time in Mexico, or travel there for medical procedures, you should: - share your plans or wishes with relatives - make sure important documents can easily be located - make arrangements in case of your death while in the country Useful links Keep in Mind... The decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveller. The traveller is also responsible for his or her own personal safety. Be prepared. Do not expect medical services to be the same as in Canada. Pack a [travel health kit](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/kit), especially if you will be travelling away from major city centres. Laws and culture You must abide by local laws. Penalties for breaking the law in Mexico can be more severe than in Canada, even for similar offences. Foreign nationals are often held in pre-trial detention and there can be lengthy delays before a trial. Many petty crimes (such as public urination, failure to pay a bill or disorderly behaviour) can result in a 72-hour detention by police. Paying a fine can secure an early release from detention. Detention conditions are below the standards of Canadian prisons. Useful links Drugs Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe.

Identity documents The names on your identity documents must be identical to those on your birth certificate to obtain official Mexican documents, such as marriage certificates, immigration documents or passports.
