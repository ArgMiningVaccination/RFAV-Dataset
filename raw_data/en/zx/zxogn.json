Pneumococcal vaccines can help you avoid getting sick. Pneumococcal bacteria are a common cause of pneumonia, which is an infection of the lungs. Almost 1 million people ages 65 or older are hospitalized with pneumonia each year. Around 30 percent of older adults treated for pneumonia will die. 1Pneumococcal Vaccines for Older Adults (65+ years of Age) Everyone ages 65 and older should get vaccinated. Especially if you are at high risk, such as: n Nursing home residents n People with heart disease, diabetes, asthma, lung disease, HIV, or other chronic health problems. Two kinds of pneumococcal vaccines are available for people aged 65 and older: n Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV13 and PCV15, and PCV20). These vaccines help protect you against the most severe types of pneumococcal bacteria. n Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), This vaccine gives protection against 23 more types of pneumococcal bacteria than the conjugate vaccines. Both types of vaccines are safe and effective, but they cannot be given at the same time. The table below lists the vaccine recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for all adults 65 years or older. Your healthcare provider will help you figure out which are the right vaccines for you to receive. Category Recommendation Adults 65+ who have not previously received any One dose of PCV20 pneumococcal vaccine or their pneumococcal OR vaccination history is unknown One dose of PCV15 followed by one dose of PPSV23 at least 1 year later* Adults 65+ who have received PPSV23 but who One dose of PCV15 or PCV20 a year have not previously received any pneumococcal after receiving PPSV23 conjugate vaccine (PCV13, PCV15, or PCV20) Adults 65+ who have previously received only PCV13 One dose of PPSV23 at least 1 year later * If you have an immunocompromising condition, cochlear implant, or cerebrospinal fluid leak, the PCV15 and PPSV23 doses can be given a minimum of 8 weeks apartPneumococcal Vaccine Recommendations for Older Adults 65 years or older3Side Effects Most people who get a pneumococcal vaccine do not have any serious problems with it.

These symptoms include: n Coughing. Sometimes you can cough up greenish, yellow, or even bloody mucus n Fever, sweating, and chills n Rapid, shallow breathing n Sharp or stabbing chest pain that gets worse when you cough or breathe deeply n Loss of appetite, low energy, and fatigue n Confusion, especially in older adultsGet help right away If you have any pneumonia symptoms, get medical help right away.
