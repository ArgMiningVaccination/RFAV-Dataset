There is no one-size-fits-all diet for people living with ulcerative colitis. Your diet will likely vary when you are in remission versus when you have disease flares. During remission, it's important to maintain a nutrient-rich diet to stay healthy by eating foods like these: - Fiber-Rich Food Beans, barley, nuts, oat bran, and whole grains are part of this category. But if you have an ostomy or intestinal narrowing, or have had a recent surgery, a low-fiber diet is advised. - Foods High in Protein This includes lean meats, eggs, fish, and tofu. - Fruits and Vegetables Include as many different colors of fruits and vegetables in your diet as you can. - Calcium-Rich Foods Yogurt, collard greens, and milk (if you are not lactose intolerant) are among the offerings as well as calcium-fortified foods and drinks. Foods to Eat When You Are Having a Flare You may want to try the following foods: - Bananas - White or sourdough bread - Crackers made with white flour (not whole-grain flour) - White rice (not brown rice) - Cheese (if you're not lactose intolerant) - Diluted fruit juices and sports drinks - Applesauce - Canned fruit - Smooth peanut butter - Plain cereal - Refined pasta (not whole grain) - Broth - Cooked vegetables - Potatoes without skin - Broiled or steamed fish - Plain turkey, chicken, or eggs Keeping a [food journal](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-and-nutrition/diet/tips-weight-loss-actually-work/) can help you figure out which foods bother you and which ones don't.

While no foods have been clearly found to worsen inflammation or ulceration in ulcerative colitis, [some foods](https://www.everydayhealth.com/ulcerative-colitis/everyday-guide-to-living-well/) may make symptoms such as cramping and diarrhea worse. [high-fiber foods](https://www.everydayhealth.com/photogallery/fiber-rich-foods.aspx), which are harder to digest than low-fiber foods. High-fiber foods include these items: - Fresh fruits - Prunes - Legumes like beans and lentils - Nuts - Seeds - Uncooked vegetables or vegetables with skin - Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cabbage - Whole grains Greasy, fried, or high-fat foods such as butter, margarine, and cream may also cause diarrhea.

Some people will have more trouble with certain foods and beverages than others. It's important to find out which foods cause you digestive discomfort and then avoid them. Getting Enough Fluids When You Have Ulcerative Colitis The colon absorbs water from digested food and moves solid waste out of the body. When your colon is inflamed during an active bout of ulcerative colitis, it doesn't absorb water properly, which can lead to [diarrhea and dehydration](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diarrhea/dehydration-complication-may-arise-from-diarrhea/). That's why it is so important to drink enough fluids when your ulcerative colitis is active. If you weigh 150 lbs, for example, you need at least 75 oz of fluid a day, or more than 9 cups. Most beverages, and even some high-water foods like watermelon and cucumbers, count toward this total. Since drinking ice-cold liquids or consuming too much fluid at once can worsen diarrhea, it's best to take sips of warm or cool beverages throughout the day. Avoid gulping fluids, since this can aggravate diarrhea and cause you to swallow air along with the fluid, resulting in burping. Getting Enough Nutrients When You Have Ulcerative Colitis Ulcerative colitis can make it difficult to get the nutrition you need \u2014 in terms of both major components of your diet, like protein, and specific vitamins and minerals. You may need to take vitamin or mineral supplements to make up for nutrient [deficiencies](https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/guide-to-essential-nutrients/common-nutrient-deficiencies/) caused by ulcerative colitis, your diet, or the medication you take to treat the disease. Talk to your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist about what supplements, if any, you may need. Focus on two major nutrition categories: - Total Calories Since ulcerative colitis can reduce your appetite while increasing your calorie needs, you may need to consume more calories than you're used to. - Protein When you're in remission, an adequate intake of protein is usually considered 1 gram (g) each day for each kilogram (kg) \u2014 about 2.2 lbs \u2014 of body weight. This means that if you weigh 150 lbs (68 kg), you should consume 68 g of protein daily. People with ulcerative colitis are at an [increased risk for deficiency](https://www.everydayhealth.com/ulcerative-colitis/treatment/need-to-know-nutrients-for-ulcerative-colitis/) of the following vitamins and minerals: - Folate, especially if you take [sulfasalazine](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/sulfasalazine)(Azulfidine) - Magnesium, especially if you have chronic diarrhea - Calcium, especially if you take [prednisone](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/prednisone)(Deltasone) - Iron, especially with greater blood loss from severe disease [Potassium](https://www.everydayhealth.com/pictures/foods-high-in-potassium/), a higher risk with chronic vomiting or diarrhea, or if you take prednisone Eating during a disease flare may cause abdominal cramping. One way to minimize this discomfort is by eating frequent, small meals of bland foods. If you're having trouble finding foods that don't worsen your symptoms, or if you're losing weight because of that difficulty, consult a registered dietitian who is knowledgeable about inflammatory bowel disease.
