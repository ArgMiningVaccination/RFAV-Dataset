What is mRNA and what does it do? mRNA or \"messenger\" RNA is the coding system for cell nucleuses to send to ribosomes to create proteins. The vaccine creators took the genome of the COVID -19 virus and were able to find and duplicate the mRNA sequence nee ded to produce the spike protein on the COVID -19 virus. The vaccine contains this mRNA code and is injected into the muscle of the upper arm. Our cells then take the mRNA and process it through our ribosomes, thus creating and expressing the spike protein on the cell wall. Our body's immune system recognizes the spike protein as an intruder, and creates antibodies to combat the foreign protein. These antibodies lead to our immunity to COVID -19. Once our cells use the mRNA, it is destroyed by the cells natu ral process for mRNA. The mRNA will not alter your DNA , as it does not enter the cell's nucleus where your DNA is stored. 2. Why did it only take ~10 months to get this vaccine to market when other vaccines can take up to 10 years? Isn't that rushed? Valid question! Here are some of the reasons it was possible . a. mRNA vaccines are easy to make, and the technology was already developed to do this. Scientists coded the genetic material of SARS -CoV-2 in January 2020 and shared this with the world. b. The American (and global) vaccine manufacturing power has been focused on 1 problem since January 2020. When that happens in any field, an amazing feat of accomplishment is sure to follow. c. mRNA vaccines are very sensitive to temperature ; for example, the Pf izer vaccine require s storage down to a temperature of -60 C to -80 C . That's cold! Pre -2020, no freezers in our vaccine clinics (or hospital pharmacies ) were able to go down that low. There wasn't the cold -chain infrastructure & technology to mass prod uce and transport these vaccines prior to this pandemic, making it unlikely 2 that a for -profit pharmaceutical company would manufacture a vaccine with such difficult storage requirements . d. The U.S. government gave them billions of dollars through Operation W arp Speed to produce and study these vaccines in large Phase III trials (30,000 in Moderna's trial, and 44,000 patients in Pfizer' s). These trials cost a lot of money to complete, and they are very risky for the company - what if the drug/vaccine doesn't pan out? The U.S. government took this risk off the table when they subsidized the p harmaceutical companies to produce and study these vaccines. If the vaccine turned out to not be effective, the company can simply throw away the vaccines and they don't have to go bankrupt in the process. 3. Why are there no other mRNA vaccines ? This technology isn't entirely new. It has been used for other coronaviruses, but was not mass -produced since they did not cause a global pandemic. mRNA vaccines have also been studied in the treatment of cancer, as a way to target specific proteins on tumors and train your body's immune system to target the tumor. In addition, see #2.c. above describing the transportation and storage challenges with mRNA vaccines, which took a g lobal pandemic to overcome. 4. What about the side effects of these vaccines? Although some patients in both the Pfizer and Moderna study developed Bell's palsy in the vaccine arm, the FDA does not consider this to be a causal relationship since the freq uency of this event is what is expected in the general population. To date, no cases of Guillain -Barre syndrome have been reported following vaccination in either of the mRNA phase III trials or post -marketing information currently available. 5. What about the reports surrounding the Pfizer vaccine causing infertility or allergic reactions ? Infertility c laims : There are recent claims made by a previous employed doctor at Pfizer that Pfizer's vaccine causes female sterilization. The origins of this claim stem from the similarity between the SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein (the mRNA vaccines encode for this protein), and syn cythin -1, which is a protein vital for the formulation of the placenta. The reported risk is that the body mounts an immune response to the spike protein, as well as the syncythin -1 protein in the placenta, causing infertility in women. However, only two very small parts of these proteins look the same - it's not the whole protein. In addition, if this were true, COVID -19 infection should also cause infertility, since active infection produces the same antibody response to the spike protein. At this poi nt in time, scientists have not made the association between infertility and COVID -19 infection or receipt of an y mRNA vaccines. 0%20%40%60%80%100% Pain at injection siteFatigue Headache Myalgia Arthralgia Nausea / VomittingAxillary swelling/ tendernessFever Swelling at injection siteerythema at injection siteAdverse Reactions Reported by All Participants Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna3 Allergic Reaction s: For both Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna COVID -19 vaccines, severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine is a contraindication to vaccination (see #7 below). Precaution and risk assessment should be made for individuals with a history of severe allergy reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to another vaccination or injectable therapy. I f they elect to receive vaccine, they should be monitored for at least 30 minutes after vaccination . Individuals with ANY history of anaphylaxis may proceed with vaccination but should be monitored for 30 minutes after vaccination. All other individuals sh ould be monitored for at least 15 minutes after vaccination. 6. How effective are the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines ? Pfizer - Phase 2/3 final efficacy analysis shows vaccine as 95% effective against COVID -19 beginning 7 days after the second dose (Day 1 and Day 21 dose schedule). Of the 170 confirmed cases of COVID -19 evaluated, 162 cases were in the placebo group vs. 8 cases in the vaccine group. Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics. The observed efficacy in adults over 65 years of age was over 94%. There were 10 severe cases of COVID -19 observed in the trial, with nine of the cases occur ring in the placebo group and only one in the vaccinated group, which is another consideration when it comes to receiving the vaccine - reducing risk of developing to severe disease. Based on the cumulative incidence curve for the all-available efficacy population after Dose 1, (Figure 2), COVID -19 disease onset appears to occur similarly for both vaccine and placebo groups until approximately 14 days after Dose 1, at which time point, the curves diverge, with more cases accumulati ng in the placebo group than in the vaccine group, and there does not appear to be evidence of waning protection during the follow -up time of approximately 2 months following the second dose that is being evaluated at this point in time. Dose 1 Dose 2 4 Moderna - Primary efficacy analysis shows vaccine as 94.1% effective against COVID -19 beginning at 14 days after the second dose (Day 1 and Day 28 dose schedule). Of the 196 cases of COVID -19 evaluated, 185 cases were in the placebo group vs. 11 in the vaccine group. Effic acy was consistent across age, race and ethnicity, and gender demographics. All 30 severe cases of COVID -19 were from the placebo group, zero in the vaccine group. 7. What ingredients /excipients are in th ese mRNA vaccine s? What if I have had a severe aller gic reaction to any component of the vaccine? For both Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna COVID -19 vaccines, severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine is a contraindication to vaccination. 8. What about patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding? Were these populations enrolled in the mRNA vaccine trials? Pregnant people Observational data demonstrate that while the absolute risk is low, pregnant people with COVID -19 have an increased risk of severe illness, including il lness resulting in intensive care admission, mechanical ventilation, or death. Additionally, they might be at an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth. There are currently few data on the safety of COVID -19 vaccines, includin g mRNA vaccines, in pregnant people. Limited data are currently available from animal developmental and reproductive toxicity studies. No safety concerns were demonstrated in rats that received Moderna COVID -19 vaccine prior to or during gestation in terms of female reproduction, fetal/embryonal development, or postnatal development. Studies in pregnant people are planned and the vaccine manufacturers are following outcomes in people in the clinical trials who became pregnant. mRNA vaccines are not live vac cines. The mRNA in the vaccine is degraded quickly by normal cellular processes and does not enter the nucleus of the cell. Based on current knowledge, experts believe that mRNA vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to the pregnant person or the 5 fetus. Howe ver, the potential risks of mRNA vaccines to the pregnant person and the fetus are unknown because these vaccines have not been studied in pregnant people. If pregnant people are part of a group that is recommended to receive a COVID -19 vaccine (e.g., healthcare personnel), they may choose to be vaccinated. A conversation between the patient and their clinical team may assist with decisions regarding the use of a mRNA COVID -19 vaccine, though a conversation with a healthcare provider is not required pri or to vaccination. When making a decision, pregnant people and their healthcare providers should consider the level of COVID -19 community transmission, the patient's personal risk of contracting COVID -19, the risks of COVID -19 to the patient and potential risks to the fetus, the efficacy of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, and the lack of data about the vaccine during pregnancy. Side effects can occur with COVID -19 vaccine use in pregnant people, similar to those expected among non - pregnant pe ople. Pregnant people who experience fever following vaccination may be counseled to take acetaminophen as fever has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Acetaminophen may be offered as an option for pregnant people experiencing other post -vacc ination symptoms as well. There is no recommendation for routine pregnancy testing before receipt of a COVID -19 vaccine. Those who are trying to become pregnant do not need to avoid pregnancy after mRNA COVID -19 vaccination. Lactating people There are no data on the safety of COVID -19 vaccines in lactating people or the effects of mRNA COVID -19 vaccines on the breastfed infant or milk production/excretion. mRNA vaccines are not thought to be a risk to the breastfeeding infant. A lactating person who is pa rt of a group recommended to receive a COVID -19 vaccine (e.g., healthcare personnel) may choose to be vaccinated. Below are registries created for pregnant or lactating people getting the vaccine: 1. COVID -19 MILK HUMAN MILK STUDY: collecting human milk sam ples in women who are vaccinated. Email covid19humanmilkstudy@gmail.com 2. University of Washington Pregnancy and Lactation Registry: https ://redcap.iths.org/surveys/?s=87JFRCL8R8 3. Moderna call 1 -866-MODERNA (1 -866-663-3762). 9. What if I was already infected with COVID -19? Should I still receive the vaccine? mRNA vaccine should be offered to individuals regardless of their history of prior symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS -CoV-2 infection. If an individual has a documented SARS -CoV-2 infection in the last 90 days, they may delay vaccination until near the end of this period as re -infection is unlikely in the 90 days following SARS -CoV-2 infection. For individuals with known current SARS -CoV-2 infection, vaccination should be deferred until the person has fully recovered from acute illness, and is no longer in isolation per current recommendations. At this time, experts do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID -19. The immunity someone gains from having an infection, called natural immunity, varies from person to person. Some early evidence suggests na tural immunity may not last very long. We won't know how long immunity produced by vaccination lasts until we have a vaccine and more data on how well it works. 6 10. What if I test positive for SARS -CoV-2 after my first vaccination? Should I receive the second dose? For individuals that develop a positive SARS -CoV-2 test AFTER receipt of the first dose of an mRNA vaccine, the 2nd dose should still be administered, and should be timed according to the manufacturer's instructions, in addition to being defe rred until the person has fully recovered from acute illness, and is no longer in isolation per current recommendations. NOTE: the 2nd vaccine can be delayed to meet these requirements. 11. Will vaccination affect results of a SARS -CoV-2 test after vaccinati on? Prior receipt of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine will not affect the results of SARS -CoV-2 viral tests (nucleic acid amplification or antigen tests). Currently available antibody tests for SARS -CoV-2 assess IgM and/or IgG to one of two viral proteins: spike or nucleocapsid. Because both the Pfizer -BioNTech and COVID -19 vaccines contain mRNA that encodes the spike protein, a positive test for spike protein IgM/IgG could indicate either prior infection or vaccination. To evaluate for evidence of prior i nfection in an individual with a history of mRNA COVID -19 vaccination, a test specifically evaluating IgM/IgG to the nucleocapsid protein should be used. Antibody testing is not currently recommended to assess for immunity to COVID -19 following mRNA COVID -19 vaccination or to assess the need for vaccination in an unvaccinated person. 12. What i s the current recommendation for co -administration with other vaccines? How long should other vaccines be separated from an mRNA COVID -19 Vaccine? Given the lack of da ta on the safety and efficacy of mRNA COVID -19 vaccines administered simultaneously with other vaccines, the vaccine series should be administered alone, with a minimum interval of 14 days before or after administration with any other vaccines. If mRNA COV ID-19 vaccines are inadvertently administered within 14 days of another vaccine, doses do not need to be repeated for either vaccine. "}
