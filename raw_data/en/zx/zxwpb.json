The Reset Detox Diet is a low-calorie herbal juice diet for internal cleansing and weight loss. It's a personalized program your practitioner will create for you after an in-depth consultation to provide you with a healthier and more balanced way of living. Over 2,000 patients have completed our Reset Detox Diet program and experienced improvements with obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, arthritis, allergies, skin conditions, depression, and other chronic illnesses. How it works Our bodies expend energy from the food we consume and digest. And as we age, our bodily functions decline and become less efficient, including the digestive system. And toxins from residue begin to accumulate in our intestines, and much of our energy is used up just to keep our systems running. And toxic chemicals from everyday life - alcohol, cigarette, pesticides, mercury, food additives, oral contraceptives, cleaning supplies, and even perfume - compile with the residue and causes various symptoms such as, fatigue, skin irritation, chronic migraine, and muscle pain. And our Reset Detox Diet is designed to benefit you in two folds: First, it allows your body's digestive system to rest. During the detox period, your digestive system is safe from overworking. And it is able to use the valuable energy to restore the damaged parts of your body. Second, it helps your body's digestive system to reset. Our bodies try to break the toxins down into less harmful compounds that can be excreted. However, due to continuous exposure, some toxins are left in our bloodstream, or in the liver, fat cells, and intestines. And our Reset Detox Diet is a specialized treatment to remove these harmful toxins and reset your digestive system. "}
