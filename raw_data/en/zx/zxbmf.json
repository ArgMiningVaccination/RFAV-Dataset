Sarin, tabun, soman and VX are among the classified nerve agents. Health effects depend on the amount of exposure to a nerve agent. - Symptoms of acute, low-dose nerve agent exposure include: runny nose, chest tightness, \\\"pinpoint\\\" or abnormally constricted pupils, excessive salivation and sweating, abdominal cramps, muscle twitching, visual disturbances, headache, slurred speech, nausea, hallucinations and confusion. - Symptoms of acute, high-dose nerve agents include: coughing and breathing problems, loss of consciousness, seizures, paralysis, and coma and potentially death from respiratory/nervous system failure. - These initial symptoms of nerve agent toxicity occur within minutes to hours of the exposure. Fatigue, irritability, nervousness, and memory deficits may persist as long as six weeks after the exposure. - Those with mild-to-moderate nerve agent exposure usually recover completely. Vesicants: These kinds of agents cause blistering of the skin and mucous membranes on contact. Mustard gas belongs to a class of organic compounds that include sulfur mustard (Yperite) and nitrogen mustard. Lewisite is an arsenic-containing agent in this class. As gases, these agents appear yellow-brown in color and smell like mustard, garlic, or horseradish. In pure form at room temperature, they are thick and almost-odorless liquids. - Exposure to mustard is usually not fatal. - Signs and symptoms may not occur for up to 24 hours. These can include: redness and itching of the skin, irritation, pain, and swelling of the eyes, runny nose, sneezing, hoarseness, bloody nose, sinus pain, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting, and decreased formation of blood cells (aplastic anemia) or decreased red or white blood cells and platelets (pancytopenia). - Exposure to mustard liquid is more likely to produce significant burns and scarring than is exposure to mustard vapor. Extensive breathing in of the vapors can cause chronic respiratory disease or repeated respiratory infections. Biological A biological attack, or bioterrorism, is the intentional release of viruses, bacteria, or other germs that can sicken or kill people, livestock, or crops. Anthrax is a common agent to be used in such an attack. - Symptoms depend on the exposure pathway and can appear between 1 day and 2 months after the exposure. These can include: swelling, fever and chills, blistering, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, and headache. - If left untreated, anthrax infections have the potential to spread throughout the body and cause severe illness or death. - Nerve Agents webpage - https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/nerve-agents/index.asp - Mustard Gas webpage - https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/mustardgas/index.asp - Project 112/Project SHAD webpage - https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/shad/index.asp - Edgewood Arsenal webpage - https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/edgewood-aberdeen/index.asp - VA Munitions at Khamisiyah, Iraq webpage - https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/gulfwar/sources/chem-bio-weapons.asp - DOD - Chemical and Biological Exposures (health.mil) webpage - https://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/Environmental-Exposures/Chemical-and-Biological-Exposures?type=Fact+Sheets - ATSDR - Nerve Agents FAQs - https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts166.pdf - ATSDR - Mustard Gas FAQs - https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tfacts49.pdf - WRIISC - Anthrax Vaccine Fact Sheet - https://www.warrelatedillness.va.gov/WARRELATEDILLNESS/education/factsheets/anthrax.pdf National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine reports: - NASEM - Gulf War and Health: Updated Literature Review on Sarin (2004) - https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/11064/gulf-war-and-health-updated-literature-review-of-sarin - NASEM - Assessing Health Outcomes among Veterans of Project SHAD (2016) - https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/21846/chapter/3 Get a Registry Evaluation - Environmental Health Coordinator - https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/coordinators.asp Contact your local https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/coordinators.asp or VA Primary Care Team about getting a registry evaluation.

To be eligible, you must be a Veteran or Servicemember who deployed to contingency operations in Southwest Asia at any time on or after August 2, 1990 (as defined in 38 CFR 3.317(e)(2)), or Afghanistan or Djibouti on or after September 11, 2001. These regions include the following countries, bodies of water, and the airspace above these locations: - Iraq - Afghanistan - Kuwait - Saudi Arabia - Bahrain - Djibouti - Gulf of Aden - Gulf of Oman - Oman - Qatar - United Arab Emirates (UAE) - Waters of the Persian Gulf, Arzabian Sea, and Red Sea The registry consists of a web-based self-assessment to be completed by the eligible individual, which can be found at: http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/burnpits/action-plan.asp. Participants may also schedule an optional in-person clinical evaluation by a VA provider. Active Duty Servicemembers who would like a similar voluntary medical evaluation may contact your local military hospital or clinic and state that you would like an appointment specifically to address health concerns related to the Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry exposures. Please note a medical evaluation is NOT required to be in the registry. - For more "}
