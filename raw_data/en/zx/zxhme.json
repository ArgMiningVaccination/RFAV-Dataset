SHAH: First of all, good morning to everyone here -- first of all, good morning to everyone here on the call and in the city. I'm really, really grateful for the opportunity to speak before all of you today. I just wanted to start by telling you a little bit about why we're interested in rebuilding Mercy Hospital. My name is Dr. Jawad Shah. And, in 2008, I founded Insight which was to provide clinical services, neurosurgery, and other neurosciences, particularly, in the Flint, Michigan area. I'm sure you've heard much about the city of Flint. When everyone else was leaving the town, many of my colleagues and physicians, because of the unique economic and other problems within the city, we decided to go the opposite direction and move into the city. And we started with a former General Motors headquarters that had Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 10 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 been spun off to some company named Delphi that subsequently went bankrupt. The facility was around 600,000 square feet and was scheduled to be torn down. And I was one neurosurgeon, we had a staff of four, we've now grown to around 400 people. The north part of the campus was then given to a company called Diplomat which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and grew to an over billion-dollar company, multiple billion-dollar company. So that entire quarter was revamped clinically, financially, and we see more and more growth in that area. Our core focus is patient care second to none. It's at the heart of everything that we do. And there's nothing that comes before the health and well-being of our patients. The core most value we have is love. When it comes to the idea -- and I know this may seem to be a little bit of a cliche, but if you love what you do, you love your patients, you love your work, you're going to perform marvelously. If you love God, you're going to do the right thing. If you love your family, you're going to do the right thing. And Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 11 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 this is why we consider the core -- - our core value -- our core value is love, love for our work, love for the community, love for everything that we do. Our operations in Michigan includes a hospital, multiple ambulatory surgical centers, a biomedical campus, research division, a healing center, and a wellness center. We've had great success thanks to our building community, our loyal patient base, and our dedicated staff and physicians. We believe that our work in Michigan has given us the necessary experience and expertise to successfully operate and rebuild a sustainable Mercy Hospital in Chicago. Our approach to health care is holistic and involves not only an emphasis on efficient hospital operations, but on providing the highest quality of care for all patients, regardless of their ability to pay. Our team has also been engaged in hospital turnarounds in multiple communities in Michigan. Each time we've been involved in hospital work, service line offerings were increased, and there's been significant investment and various capital Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 12 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 improvements. We have a proven track record of success with expansion of community investment that includes transforming the former General Motors headquarters into the bustling Insight Institute of Neurosurgery and Neuroscience and overall into Insight. Acquiring a hospital earmarked to be shut down in Warren, Michigan, in less than one year, we made it financially solvent. We purchased an abandoned building in the north part of Flint, 70,000 square feet, it was a former elementary school, and we transformed it into the Sylvester Broome Empowerment Village. Our focus is to bring youth in, and we went from seeing two to three people per month to 600 children and 10, 12 hours of programming. Their marks have gone up, they've done exceptionally well, we're extremely proud of the staff and the work that's been done there, particularly by our executive director. It is now a solvent, bustling part of the north part of the city. We've acquired multiple surgery centers, each of which are financially solvent. We've Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 13 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 created multiple independent divisions, each of which is financially solvent. We currently collaborate with the University of Michigan and MSU, Michigan State University, with our research and teaching. We've -- our research institute has had incredible growth, innovation, clinical publications, and so much other exceptional work that's been done by the division and its leadership. We have created medical and business teaching facilities and an incubator where products themselves are starting to come out from our work. Overall, our plans for Mercy are that we would continue that same vein and work to create a fully-functional acute care hospital that serves the needs of the community. We would like to see behavioral health, rehab, medical/surgical beds, and OBs unit, ICU, an emergency department; and then, of course, bring in multiple new subspecialty lines including orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, and some of the -- the additional service lines that are critical to creating an exceptional institution.

We want to make this a world-class institute that attracts people from all over the world and the state and they come now to Bronzeville and they come now to this hospital where they see something absolutely exceptional in terms of our ability to deliver exceptional care. I really, once again, appreciate the opportunity to speak to you all. And, humbly, I hope that we can all band together to make this an exceptional transition and transformation. I would ask, humbly, that if you accept us into the community and to allow this acquisition and transition to occur. Thank you very much for your time.

ABID: Hello to everyone. I'm Omer Abid, a physician working in Insight's wellness center in Flint, Michigan, which provides comprehensive care to patients with opioid use disorder and other addictions. I wanted to say a few words to share how Dr. Shah and Insight have helped me, and I believe that their compassion will also help the patients around Mercy Hospital. I was born in Chicago and raised in Chicago and the suburbs. I did medical school at UIC and then after completing preventative medicine residency at the University of Michigan, Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 16 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 I did an epidemic intelligence service fellowship at the CDC. For the next 15 years, I worked mostly in public health. I had an interest to eventually return to clinical medicine, but my long commitment to public health made the return difficult in multiple ways. I always had an interest in behavioral health and felt that interest could help with the opioid epidemic in the U.S. I'm currently working at Insight for over a year. Since I'm new to the field, it has taken me time to start mastering the art and science of treating patients with opioid use disorder and other addictions. I can think of no other institution as much as Insight that would be so patient in believing in human capital and in investing in individuals, such as myself, before the institution itself benefits financially. I have also seen how Insight has invested so much in the residents around Insight, such as letting many inpatients indefinitely stay at Insight's Healing Center and neuro and trauma rehabilitation center if they have no place to Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 17 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 live and in helping to provide educational and safe recreational activities to the youth at the Broome Center. I hope the leaders around Mercy Hospital seize this great opportunity to benefit the community through Insight, as it has helped me and countless others in Flint and elsewhere in Michigan. Thank you. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you. Okay. I'm going to go a little bit out of order because of time constraints. Mayor Walling, please proceed. MAYOR WALLING: All right. Well, hello, everyone. My name is Dayne Walling, and I currently am principal and senior policy advisor with my own company, 21 P/M/C, Policy Management Consulting. I served two terms as Flint's mayor. Flint's my hometown and where I grew up and went to school and raising my own family. Those terms in office were from 2009 to 2015. And I had the privilege of being in office when Dr. Shah and his team were advancing their work with Insight, as he mentioned, with the early investments in our community. It -- so I'm on Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 18 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 today to simply share my experience in working with Insight as a public official and also the continued impact, the positive impact, that I've seen in the community as a resident. The work to revitalize the facility was very significant. Dr. Shah mentioned, you know, the hundreds of thousands of square feet on the main campus on South Saginaw and Hemphill Roads, if you want to take a look at the footprint on Google Maps. It's a very complicated piece of property; and Insight and Dr. Shah's vision were really extraordinary with what they brought to the facility in navigating the complexities of the obsolete property, the ownership with the County Land Bank, the fact that it had been a Brownfields initiative. So even just the acquisition of that property took a great deal with wherewithal and commitment. I've been through the facility many times myself. It's -- it's immaculately maintained. It's open and available for all the services that you've heard about from those who are leading those different practices. And the community has a very positive impression and sense of Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 19 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 favorability about the facility. There were many people who worked out at the wellness and fitness center who expected that to no longer be available when one of our major medical systems here in the community was no longer able to operate it. And Insight stepped right in, as they've become able to do, and continued those, you know, subscriptions and services to a part of our community that really desperately needed it and would have had to travel, you know, miles and miles to get to another similar fitness facility and wellness facility. The building's been open for community events, the cultural -- the annual unity and diversity event takes place there, and there are so many others that I've attended over the years. So I just, again, wanted to take these few minutes to share how positive of an influence Insight has been in the Flint community with the main campus there on the south side, it's actually on South Saginaw Street, and then the Sylvester Broome Center, the former elementary school, is actually on North Saginaw Street on the opposite Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 20 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 end of town, and you've heard a bit about the programs and impact that they've been able to have there. So the community has been very impressed and very involved with all the work that's taken place. So I hope you'll bear that in mind as you consider their application, and thank you for your time today. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you, Mayor. Next, we will have Anne Igoe.

Our members stand with the Chicago Health Equity Coalition in our opposition to the current process. We are requesting to postpone any approval of transfer of ownership until the Chicago Health Equity Coalition can meet and vet all potential buyers of Mercy Hospital. The pandemic of COVID has pushed to the surface the pandemic of systematic racism and poverty as reflected in health care in this city. We are here today as a result of a decision by Trinity Health to close a needed and utilized hospital in the middle of a pandemic, a hospital that this community has demanded to keep open. But just keeping the lights on in the building does not meet the demands of the community. Health care should be seen as a public good and not just a transfer of property from Trinity Health to whomever they deem most beneficial. The public and the Coalition specifically needs and wants to ensure that any potential owner, Insight included, ensures that Mercy Hospital continues to function as a Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 22 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 full-service public safety net hospital, maintains a full-service emergency room, respects the rights of workers who have a union contract and new workers who wish to form and join a union, and values community members as full voting members on the board of directors. Now is the time for providing more resources to black communities, for providing more health care services, and giving more voice to workers and community members. We will not stand by as a change of ownership is pushed through without an opportunity to fully vet any potential owner. The lives of CEOs at Trinity Health are not on the line, but the lives of those in the Bronzeville community are. Thank you for your time today. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you.

This community center, as had Dr. Shah highlighted, started with about 15 students coming in every month. We have over 300 students coming in daily. When we were hit by the pandemic, we transitioned very quickly to have these same students come on board online. Our ability to work closely with the community has been remarkable. We've been very fortunate to work with local systems in the community, to work with national organizations, such as the NFL and Toyota, to help facilitate community growth. Our focus has always been on the youth. Although we always say that our core is patient care second to none, our passion is truly about youth development and really being part of that community, and that's what we've done in Flint. We would like to bring the same sort of endeavor to the Chicago community and, specifically, to Mercy Hospital.

Thank you, Ms. Avery. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you. Have a good day. Okay. Next, we will have -- Anne, I'm going to unmute your microphone. Anne Wantanabe, please proceed. MS. WANTANABE: Sure. Good morning. My name is Anne Wantanabe, and I'm a nurse at Mercy Hospital. I just wanted to express my concern about how extremely rushed this process has been. There's been no community input in this decision. There was no process to properly vet potential buyers to make sure that the best choice was made. And, you know, we essentially went from being told the hospital was absolutely going to close to, suddenly, within a few days, suddenly being told that Trinity had agreed to sell the hospital, but they've already signed a deal with Insight. And there was no conversation or any community input at all. So, you know, I'm really happy that Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 27 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Trinity did agree to sell the hospital and, you know, that there's some step towards keeping it open, but I just really want to emphasize that any plan to keep it open under a new owner has to mean that it's properly preserved as a full-service safety net hospital and not, you know, turned into anything else or downgraded into a skeleton of what it formerly was. And just to kind of illustrate this point, I just want to point out that, you know, right now, we've been operating with the emergency downgraded from a comprehensive to a basic ER, which means we can't receive city ambulances. So, you know, we have hardly any patients at the hospital right now, and our sickest patients who need the most care and who have been coming to Mercy for many years are being sent to surrounding hospitals right now. So they're being sent to places that don't have any of their medical records, they don't have relationships with the providers, where they have to sit in longer ambulance rides to receive critical, lifesaving care, and where they have to sit in extremely packed ERs for even longer, you know, as Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 28 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 -- as the health care resources on the south side continue to be stretched beyond their capacity. So, you know, I know a nurse in the University of Chicago ER, and he told me that, you know, they're receiving many of our Mercy patients there right now, and because they don't have the same services that we do, like, for example, they don't have inpatient psychiatric care, our psych patients that are going there are, you know, basically sitting in their ER waiting to be transferred to another hospital when a bed opens up because they can't be admitted in house. So, you know, us -- Mercy not having all of the services that it should is really just stretching the health care resources on the south side in the entire system, you know, way beyond its capacity. It's delaying care for patients in ways that can cause harm or it could even cause death for patients. So I just want to voice my support for, you know, the Health Equity Coalition's call to delay this decision and to allow the Coalition to, you know, properly vet potential buyers and to make a recommendation about who the best buyer Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 29 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 should be.

And I'm here to speak on behalf of the Insight Biomedical Technology Institute which he is located here in the city of Flint. I am very -- a strong supporter of Dr. Shah and the program. He has been a very good community patriot as well as a good neighbor as part of the corporation, and he is making sure that from every social level and medical engagement that he has had in his organization has been a very strong partner of this community. And I want to make sure that we vouch for him and the things that he believes for this community. A few years ago, Insight purchased the abandoned General Motors building headquartered in the city of Flint, and they have invested a lot of time, resources, and their own personal wealth into making sure our community is helped and residents are stronger as a byproduct of their investment. Socially, persons of our community and down our poverty corridor, they have also invested in the social needs and activities for residents inside of our community as well. And so this is a first-class community Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 31 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 project after school program that they have brought to our community as well, and I urge you to welcome Insight into your community. I understand that they have -- they want to save money at Mercy Hospital in Chicago. And Dr. Shah and his team, if they can duplicate what they have done inside the city of Flint, which we have many areas of concern and challenges, but if they can duplicate what they have done on their enhancement effort for your community, I would urge and support you to also do so. And so I, once again, stand firmly in support of this organization and Dr. Shah as they go forth in trying to engage other communities throughout our country. Thank you.

My name is John Picken, P-I-C-K-E-N, and I have been an ob-gyn doctor at Mercy Hospital for 51 years. And a lot of the comments that I was about to make are Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 32 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 included in the Equity Coalition report, which I just went over. So I'm going to jump to some things that aren't in there. One is the safety net law. And I'm not sure of all the options in the safety net law. Mercy has, of course, been the largest participant and recipient of funds in the safety net program in Chicago, because it sees more safety net patients than any other facility in Chicago. What I'm wondering about is does that safety net law include anything like a catastrophic paragraph or item. And, that is, if an earthquake or tornado were to destroy part of a safety net hospital, or if there was a fire that damaged a huge part of the hospital, would there be some safety net policy where funds would be available to help rebuild the damage from the catastrophe? Now, we're dealing with a catastrophe at Mercy, not so much of the physical plant, but of loss of the entire personnel of the hospital, almost 100 percent. Over 500 doctors have been fired, over 1,700 other employees, nurses, nurses aides, whatever, technicians. And so we face a Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 33 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 personnel crisis to bring back a personnel that can actually reopen the hospital in a reasonable length of time, not months and years, but repopulate it with the people who wanted to work there and loved working there, and they feel their mission is to work at Mercy. And so I'm wondering if some attorney could look into the aspects of the safety net law and if there's some paragraph in there that covers catastrophes, in this case, a human catastrophe caused by Trinity, and would help us financially to rebuild very quickly all the services that are so critical like the emergency room, the OB, the psych floor. And you could go on through, you know, the whole series of the way they should be opened up in sequence. You can't open up everything overnight in one week. So that's what I'd like to say. Otherwise, I agree with the Equity Coalition's report, and I've -- there's a lot of things in that that I didn't even think of, but I appreciate the content of it, and I stand behind it. Thank you. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you. Okay.

ALDERMAN KING: Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Savage and the rest of the members of the Board. My name is Sofia King. I am the alderman of the 4th Ward where Mercy sits. I am here today, again, to testify on behalf of saving Mercy. I am curious why this meeting was called with such haste. I had to have the lobbyist for Insight inform me about it. Unfortunately, Insight and their team would not share much else with me. We know that they are now just recently managing a 20-bed hospital for orthopedics and Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 35 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 neurosurgery. How this translates into running a 400-bed hospital, I'm not sure. Perhaps it does, but more due diligence is needed. While I appreciate Insight's interest in Mercy, I am concerned about their ability, financial and otherwise, to take on this endeavor. When Insight was asked about having someone from the Community Coalition on their board, their response was that they hadn't done their due diligence on that person or those people and that they would want to do so, otherwise, you would think less of us, they said, if we just chose someone or that important position without doing so. Well, that's exactly how I feel here. It would be irresponsible for us to allow Insight to proceed without more due diligence. They said it correctly. They would think less of us. They wouldn't respect us. More importantly, we cannot allow them to disrespect our community by saying that just anyone can take over Mercy without proper vetting. We owe that to the legacy of Mercy and the community. This is not about what's expedient. It's Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 36 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 about doing what's right for Mercy and our community. We know that there are a number of entities that are interested in Mercy, including local hospitals. We should vet them all. I implore all of you to listen carefully at the information that's given, and, more importantly, what's not given. Remember, Trinity said that it tried to meet the health care needs of the south side community, however, the South Side Coalition, including Trinity-owned Mercy Hospital, refused to share details of their plan with electeds in community. Major details like how many hospitals would serve the entire south side and where a proposed new hospital would be located were left out. They essentially wanted a blank check to do whatever they chose in our community. It would have been irresponsible for us to allow millions of taxpayer dollars out the door without obvious details like when and how current hospitals would close and where a new hospital or hospitals would go. Trinity also said that it had a Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 37 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 transformational plan for the future of Mercy Hospital. This plan included, and still includes, closing a great hospital, Mercy Hospital, and its family health care center, which currently provides preventative and primary care to thousands of patients a year and replacing it with a five-room diagnostic center. They failed to mention that this five-room diagnostic center would replace their existing preventative care. Please listen to what's left out. Trinity's plan was met with an unprecedented denial to close from this Board. The Board also questioned that Trinity's plan was transformational. In fact, this Board said it was anything but transformational and actually taking a step backwards. When Trinity took over the hospital from the Sisters of Mercy, it was in great financial shape, there was no financial consideration, no cash for that deal. Trinity was handed Mercy with 140 million net in assets. Trinity recorded the transaction as a bargain, you said. Now, it is hanging in limbo by a billion-dollar company, and you are asking us to take Insight seriously Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 38 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 without vetting them sufficiently to run that very same hospital. I'm imploring you to, again, do your due diligence and wait until this applicant and others are vetted properly. Thank you for your time and consideration. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you. Okay. Dr. Cobbs, I see your hand. I'll get to you soon. Mayor Weaver. MAYOR WEAVER: Yes? HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Please begin. Please begin. MAYOR WEAVER: Good afternoon. I'm sorry.

I remember when I -- when I declared the water crisis, they came, they came, they stepped up to the plate and said, we want to be part of this, we want to help you. And they started doing, you know, lead testing. They started doing dermatological kinds of services. I mean, they have invested in this community, if you look at the Broome Center, in an area that has such great needs, and they took an old-school building and transformed it. And they gave -- they gave kids and families a place to come, a safe place to come. And I saw them go from a small amount of kids to, you know, I mean, just hundreds and hundreds of kids and families being served. And then you look at the Neuroscience Center, the Neurology Center where they are now. This was a huge empty building. It was a huge empty building. And you've got so many of those that are available in Flint, and they're seen as empty buildings.

And they -- you know, a lot of times when people hear Flint, they think about -- before the water crisis, they thought of Roger & Me. You know, then they think of the water crisis. But, you know, we have given them -- and you all have given them -- something else to think about. A neurosurgery center that has everything that they need right inside for the patients with all of the supports that go along with it, and they also have research and wellness. I mean, they've turned this into a state-of-the-art place. When you look at the jobs that they have brought, you know, I can't say enough. I cannot say enough about what they have done for this community, what they have done as far as the medical field. And I really love -- you know, I'm a psychologist by training, and I was just so impressed with I even saw that Center for Cognition and Neuroethics and partnering with the university here. And I know that, you know, they would just be such an asset if they could be there in Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 41 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Chicago. When I look at them wanting to be part and help Mercy, I just thought, wow, they have such a tremendous, wonderful track record here. And, like I said, it's not just about -- you know, it's about the health and well-being of people, but it's also about the health and well-being of a community. And so they have taken that, and they've come up with this holistic approach, and they have really just put us on the map for so much more than those negative things that we have been known for. And, like I said, I've seen them take an empty school building and transform it into something so important and necessary for our community. I've seen them take this abandoned building -- and it's a huge building, it's beautiful -- and transform it into something necessary and important for this community. And I know that they will, you know, put that same effort and energy and care into -- you know, in Chicago with Mercy Hospital.

I am speaking in opposition to the transfer of ownership of Mercy Hospital to Insight without exploring other viable options. I was raised in Bronzeville and currently live in Kenwood Hyde Park. My family has and continues to use Mercy as their chosen hospital. My father fought a debilitating illness and was given quality, compassionate care at Mercy.

This is the value of a community hospital, which is rapidly becoming an endangered species. I am an emergency physician serving at Mercy clinically and in a leadership role. I have watched my colleagues' morale suffer as this hospital is rapidly being deconstructed. The physicians, nurses, and support staff who have served at Mercy for many years have an unspoken bond with each other and the patients. This bond has been forced to break. You see, Mercy is not just an empty building and a plot of land for auction. She has a life and a soul. She is historic and resilient. She serves the community and is part of the community, and that community belongs to me and countless others. For this reason, it is impossible to watch this hospital exchange hands from one outside group to another and risk the possibility of a delayed and inevitable demise.

We have presented our intentions to acquire Mercy Hospital to the elected officials and now to the community and this Board. We are intimately aware of our community and how it has suffered racial health disparities as a result of systemic racism. Therefore, using the foundations of social determinants of health, we have formulated a comprehensive model to address the many barriers to health care and overall wellness. We have reimagined the future of Mercy. Our commitment to this community and this hospital is built on a strong foundation with deep roots. Therefore, we are encouraging this Board to consider delaying the transfer of Mercy's ownership to Insight in order to allow the community, our electeds, and Trinity to explore this option.

Let me find her. Okay. Please proceed. MS. EL-AMIN: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for allowing me to share with you a little bit this morning. My name is Hannah El-Amin. I am a very proud native south side Chicagoan here in the Kenwood community. I also work in health care as a dietician and diabetes educator, and I own and operate a private practice nearby Mercy Hospital. So I'm here as someone who is both of the community and serves the community in the health care arena. As a south sider myself, I strongly believe in the importance of seeing Mercy Hospital not only surviving but thriving. Not only has my family received exceptional care there, from the birth of my family members to the care of my mother, but I personally have provided patient care there as an intern as well. Out of the all hospitals I had an opportunity to intern at throughout my training, Mercy, by far, left the greatest positive impression on me with regards to offering compassionate and high-quality health care. I Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 46 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 believe there's something special about this space and the mission that it embodies, thoughtfully serving the community with skill and integrity. And as someone who has worked at top medical institutions here in Chicago, Loyola, Northwestern, etc., I can speak to the uniqueness of the care that one receives at Mercy. It is with this in mind that I want to speak strongly in favor of the application by Insight Group, without hesitation, to purchase Mercy and help it to continue uninterrupted on its path to thriving. I've personally kept up with some of their other projects in the past few years before I knew about this potential purchase, mainly, their efforts in Flint, Michigan. I've seen the positive and transformative impact that their efforts have had on the community there, and I truly believe that this is the group that we need and can fully trust to carry Mercy into its next chapter within the integrity and skill that we want to see in our community. I understand the hesitation that some have about this transition, because, too often, in Chicago, we've seen decisions made for our Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 47 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 communities that are not equitable and not in the community's best interest. I've personally fought against some of these decisions myself. It is because of those experiences that I want to strongly state that I see Insight Group as bringing the type of thoughtfulness and integrity that our great city desperately needs more of right now. Having seen the renewal that Insight Group has brought to other communities with their projects, I look forward to seeing them bring that same positive impact to Mercy Hospital here in Chicago and the communities surrounding it. Again, thank you all for the opportunity to share with you this morning. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you. Next, Representative Robinson, please. Hello? Representative? Representative Robinson? Okay.

We do not know enough about Insight to -- to make a good decision as to whether they can preserve -- that they have the resources and capacity to restore the hospital to its full operation. We support nothing less than Mercy's preservation as a full-service public safety net teaching hospital with a comprehensive emergency department, ob-gyn, including care for high-risk pregnancies, behavioral health, and a primary stroke and cardiac center. These are essential Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 49 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 services that our community needs. Prior to the sale of the hospital, we request a clear public plan on how the buyers will restore Mercy to its full operations. We just need more time. And so I respectfully ask the Board to postpone its decision until the community has a chance to fully vet all prospective buyers. Thank you very much. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you.

I'm calling in today to support Dr. Shah and the Insight Institute on this initiative. I met Dr. Shah about eight years ago at a charity event and had the opportunity to see what type of individual this man is. And then about a year later, I also had the opportunity to work at Insight and see firsthand the type of innovative work that they're doing around health care and so forth. Dr. Shah is an individual who contributes to the growth of Flint from a business and health care standpoint but also from a committee, community, and city development standpoint. He's really big on helping youth and helping people in general, and I think that you guys should really consider this application from Insight. He's a great individual. He has a great team and they always do things not only from a business standpoint but they help the community as an overall whole, and I think they will be a great applicant for this project.

I'm a community advocate. I represent St. James Parish on Wabash, which is a few blocks away from Mercy, and also all the pro-Mercy Coalition groups. Mercy's a very complex piece of property that serves the people who are in this area, not traitors for profit. And it advocates to improve the health outcomes of the community, not outsiders. My concern is the gentrification of this area, given I've lived here for a long time. I live -- I'm an owner. I contributed not only with tax but with my community service. And I have a feeling that there is a rush to proceed to acquire Mercy with no representation. The information given is opaque about the acquisition, and as -- as a consequence, on behalf of the people of the community, I am asking that we delay this acquisition until all members of the community have the opportunity to really vet the company that is acquiring the enterprise, I should say.

And, like I said, he's paralyzed from the neck down. Now Dr. Shah has Carlton moving his arms. It's like a miracle happened. So whatever Dr. Shah is doing, I would really like you all to support him.

We staff the emergency department and the ICUs at Mercy Hospital. I'm also a proud member of the Chicago Health Equity Coalition. And I kind of want to frame my -- frame my remarks in a couple of ways. I agree that Mercy Hospital should not be in the hands of Trinity Healthcare anymore. Now, the way that it's gone about -- or the way that it's proceeded, it seems like Trinity Healthcare has elected to go with Insight and has not really included anyone else in the conversation. I'm not here to dispute Insight's intentions. They seem like a good organization. The only thing is that we don't know what other organizations have to offer. And we're Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 55 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 dealing with a community that has consistently been underserved, but it's also been betrayed. Trinity Healthcare signed up to take care of the patient population that it served when they bought Mercy. They have since went back on their commitment and they have since, you know, effectively drawn a line in the sand that if they don't get what they want, they will shut everything down. Now, the community has come together in the efforts to save Mercy Hospital in the form of the Chicago Health Equity Coalition. We've been fighting since July, since the initial announcement, to preserve Mercy as a full-service hospital. In my remarks in front of the -- in front of the Board last time when you guys were deciding whether they could close the hospital or not, I emphasized that there are very specific services that are absolutely needed at Mercy Hospital. Those services being lifesaving services, effectively, acute stroke services, acute heart attack services, and, you know, acute intensive care services. If Mercy does not have those specific Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 56 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 services, then, effectively, it's functioning as an outpatient center. It's functioning as a reduced hospital. That's not what the community needs. We've been fighting to keep Mercy as a full-service hospital with all of the services that it's previously provided. Since Trinity has not gotten their way, they have effectively gutted Mercy, they have laid off staff, they have pushed out doctors and nurses. And it's hard to trust their judgment on anything. Now, it's not -- again, I want to reiterate, I'm not going after Insight in the sense that I don't think you guys could, but we haven't seen the other options. We have been excluded from the conversation. So as a member of the Chicago Healthcare Equity Coalition and a resident physician, I want to oppose the sale of Mercy Hospital in the hopes that we are able to meet with the other prospective buyers so that we can actually have input in the matter. I don't believe in a top-down approach in that we are told what we deserve, not only as Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 57 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 community members, but as health care providers. I want to see a bottom-up approach, meaning that we listen to the community, we listen to the doctors and the nurses and the health care providers that are working to help this community. We want to listen to them first so that we can proceed in a revolutionary and -- a revolutionary way. I don't think that this community deserves to be told what they need. I think we need to listen to the community and see what we can do to help them best. Again, I want to express my opposition in the sale so that we are able to vet the other buyers and then produce a vetted candidate for review. Thank you very much. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you.

You know, I think that Insight could be the right buyer. Insight could be a great option, but we haven't had a chance to properly see, you know, who else is also -- that could run this hospital. And, you know, the community is a stakeholder, and the community deserves a say in the way that this process goes. And we've already heard from at least one other interested buyer on this call. So, you know, I'm not opposed necessarily to eventually Insight being the one that takes it over, but I am opposed to this process being as rushed as it is, and I'm asking that the Board delay their vote and give the Coalition the space and the time to properly vet all the potential buyers of Mercy Hospital. Thank you. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you for your comments. Michael Abijomaa. I apologize. Please begin your comments and spell your name for the court reporter. MR. ABIJOMAA: Hello.

I've been working here for about three and a half years. Please accept this presentation as a strong support for the application. My community in Warren, Michigan and Flint has many similarities to the challenges faced by Mercy's south side community, and Insight is a perfect fit for Mercy's next chapter. As a nurse at Insight, I have seen Dr. Jawad Shah gradually expand the types of care we provide while never compromising the quality of health care services. Much like Mercy, Flint has often been left behind by health care providers. Insight has brought (indiscernible) to the community through its healing center. We have a Centers for Endoscopy, Cognition and Neuroethics, Imaging, and Health and Fitness Center. I have no doubt that Dr. Shah can bring the same level of care and wraparound services to Mercy. We have brought together physicians and therapy staff from so many disciplines that neurologic and orthopedic patients receive exactly the care they need. I trust Dr. Shah and support his efforts to bring world-class health care to Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 60 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Mercy Hospital, and I urge the Health Facilities and Services Review Board to do the same. And, also, on a personal note, I just find him very spiritual as a spiritual person, and he's very eloquent and just the type of person that he is and that he provides, it's bigger than him and bigger than us. And he truly cares for his patients. And thank you for hearing me. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you for your comments. Next, we have Jeffrey Goldberg. DR. GOLDBERG: Yes. Thank you very much.

I'm also a hospital administrator, and I've served as a chief medical officer for a large community hospital with a patient population very similar to that served by Mercy. I also have a degree in health care quality and safety, and I specialize in population health and the improvement of quality and safety of health care in underserved populations with substantial health care disparities, so that is the population served Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 61 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 by Mercy. In the interest of time, I'm going to have a supplemental written submission, but I do wish to make a few points. First, much has been said today about the good work that has been done by Insight in Flint, Michigan and I would congratulate them on what they have achieved. But I wish to call attention to the members of the Board that just as one can have two very competent highly-qualified doctors with very different abilities and skill sets, similarly, with hospitals, you can have two different hospitals with entirely different management needs. I hope I'm a fairly good gynecologic oncologist, but, frankly, you don't want me taking care of your heart attack or your stroke. I will do so in a pinch, but I'm clearly not the most qualified physician around to treat those problems. Similarly, when you compare the challenges at Mercy Hospital with what's been accomplished in Flint, Michigan, they are almost 180 degrees apart. For example, the hospital in Flint is a specialty hospital, specializes in neurosurgery, Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 62 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 spine surgery, and other related fields; whereas, at Mercy Hospital, they have a need for very broad focus across multiple medical and surgical specialties, population health, social work, dealing with problems with the homeless and other social challenges, obstetrics, neonatal care, and, until recently, one of the busiest emergency rooms in Cook County. None of these services are available at the hospital in Flint. There are tremendous life expectancy discrepancies in the areas surrounding Mercy that are measured not in years but decades. And while we're all aware that the population in Flint has certainly had its own set of challenges, Mercy is really at a whole different level in terms of some of the issues that have to be addressed. There's also an issue of size. Mercy is a very large, high-volume, busy hospital with typically over 10,000 discharges a year. The hospital in Flint has only about 200 discharges a year. It's so small that its quality data isn't even reported publicly on the CMS hospital compare website. There are many other differences, but I think you get the point in terms of the need for Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 63 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 an entirely different skill set than what's been necessary in Flint. What's important about what we've heard today is that we are focusing on what -- what Insight has done in Flint but not what their assessment is of Mercy. Anyone that has any kind of skilled background in dealing with underserved populations can take a look at even just the publicly available information without having the due diligence and easily identify large areas that need to be addressed, why they weren't addressed correctly, and should be able to articulate some proposed solutions to these major problems. We've heard none of that in the testimony today, and it's completely lacking from the application that has been filed. I would note that Illinois regulations require that the application contain evidence -- and I'm paraphrasing a little bit here -- but the applicant to receive the hospital must be fit, able, and qualified. And while we certainly heard testimony today about the accomplishments in Flint, we've heard nothing today that demonstrates that the same management team would be fit, able, Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 64 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 and qualified to handle the unique challenges at Mercy Hospital and the community that surrounds it. I would also add that there's nothing in the application that addressed anything regarding cost savings or benefit to the community beyond simply preventing closure of the hospital. Finally, I would also wish the Board to take note of the fact that in the many months since Trinity Health has made known their intentions, Insight was not among the group of entities that stood up to discuss pursuing acquisition of the hospital. Instead, this management team has only been brought forth by Trinity after Trinity has received not one but two adverse decisions by this Board. The circumstances around their presentation of this application have to raise some questions about whether this is truly an arms-length relationship between the two parties, Trinity and Insight, and whether this would be in the best interest of the community. It is important to note that Mercy is a nonprofit public benefit corporation. It does not Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 65 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 really belong to Trinity. It belongs to the community. It is only held in trust by Trinity for the benefit of the community. Trinity has a fiduciary obligation to ensure that these assets are used in the best manner possible for the benefit of the citizens of Illinois and, particularly, the citizens who live in the area served by Mercy. And measured by that standard, we have no evidence that Insight is the best available choice to fulfill that obligation. I'll submit the rest of my testimony in writing. Thank you. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you. Have a good day. Juan Morado, please call your next speaker. MR. MORADO: We have a patient. Christy Keiger. MS. KEIGER: Hi. My name is Christy Keiger. I have been a patient of Dr. Shah's and the Insight team for over a year now. I was diagnosed with a mass on my brain, and Dr. Shah had that removed for me.

The one thing I've heard since I've been listening in on this conversation is community, community, community. Dr. Shah and his entire team at Insight, both locations that I dealt with, are very big on serving the community. Flint and Warren are both locations in Michigan that are full of health disparities and quite diverse socio-economical levels. Dr. Shah surrounds himself with the best of the best when it comes to teams. And he is for me -- I have dealt with several doctors because of the complications with my health, and Dr. Shah, being my neurosurgeon, has taken the time -- not that it was his job -- to coordinate my care with my other specialists that weren't doing their own jobs. So he -- he may only have certification in neurosurgery, but he does have the capability to build strong teams, to work with others collaboratively to provide the best quality of care for his patients. As for community, he is very, very giving in the local Flint community. He does have Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 67 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 experience in dealing with nonprofits. And, again, he can build a team that can take on anything. He is an amazing man, and without him, I would be dead. So thank you very much. I hope you will consider him and his team to come make your location a better place. It sounds like it could use some help and needs to be providing better care for your community regardless of their insurance or economic level that they have. Thank you.

I was born at Mercy Hospital. My mother was an RN at Mercy as well as many of my younger brothers and sisters (indiscernible) -- HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Mr. Brown, are you Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 68 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 still there? MR. BROWN: Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry. I want to be clear. As a member of the Chicago Health Equity Coalition, our urge for this Board to postpone the vote has nothing to do with Insight. It has nothing to do with Insight's capabilities. We've had conversations with Insight. I found, you know, them cordial. I found that they appear to really want to do good in the Bronzeville community. So we don't doubt that. But, you know, the -- the author Alice Walker said, no one is your friend who demands your silence or denies your right to grow. And one of the things that happens to black communities is that institutions that most Americans take for granted, that they don't think whether about their hospital is going to close, they don't think about whether they have a grocery store, they don't think about whether they have a good neighborhood school. It is provided. And they have voice. Our voices have been ignored in this process. Trinity Health Systems has not only been Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 69 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 disingenuous, they have been pompous, they have ignored an activated community that actually risks their lives to save this hospital. They have ignored venerable community organizations in Bronzeville that have decades of history that have actually created health care clinics, created schools. So we cannot accept the process where someone -- whether they're fantastic or not -- says, we'll take over the hospital, but we have to depend on their benevolence as opposed to justice, as opposed to equity. And governance is the first pillar of equity. Governance says that people in the community should have a role in how decisions are made. And the great organizer Ella Baker said, all oppressed people, regardless of their level of education, have the ability to see the world around them, understand their place in the world, and move to transform it. We believe that. We are asking this Board to understand that -- and we are asking Insight -- that if -- that if Insight encompasses the values that I believe they do, then they should understand the Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 70 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 community's right to self-determination. What would be revolutionary, what would actually be transformative, is a process where the community has a voice in who provides health care when the last owner betrayed that trust. The last owner ran that hospital into the ground, and then they get to decide who runs it. So this has no reflection on Insight. This has everything to do with the right of communities to determine how institutions impact their lives. Black lives matter must mean more than just a slogan on a website. It has to be how policy is implemented, it has to be how decisions are made, how power flows through your community. So that is our ask at the Chicago Health Equity Coalition. We've said -- you've heard some of the things that we want to make sure remain in the hospital. I want to be very clear. We want equitable representation on the community board, and we are perfectly capable of understanding budgets and how to make sure that the hospital becomes financially solvent. We come from nonprofit organizations ourselves. So it's insulting to think that -- that as community Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 71 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 residents you cannot sit on a board like that.

As a former patient several years ago and hearing from other patients, I'd just like to reiterate what everyone has said that knows Dr. Shah, that knows the Insight team, that they really care. There's very rarely a time where you see a doctor willing to talk to other physicians, willing to talk to other service providers, doing what he can to make sure that you get the treatment that you need to solve the problem that you're having. And, you know, someone mentioned on the call that the communities might not align, but I would say the communities in Flint and Warren align more with the south side of Chicago than -- than probably not if we were looking at it from a statistics point of view. And then when it comes to the nonprofit work that Dr. Shah has done, you know, Mercy, being a not-for-profit organization, I can't think of a better example than the institution he's running in Flint, which was crucial in helping the residents after the Flint water crisis, being one of the distribution centers, being there to help Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 73 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 and doing whatever the community needed. And I can imagine only that Mercy, as a beacon on the south side, continues to do that, and, with Dr. Shah's help, it will expand services along those lines. So I'm completely in support of Mercy staying open, which it can't do without Insight, and, also, Dr. Shah and his team taking it over, because I can only see this becoming a real beacon where people can get all of the services that they need in the long term. And we would see the turnaround that I think most people were hoping for under the last management. Thank you very much. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you. Christina Govas? MS. GOVAS: Yes.

My name is Christina Govas, C-H-R-I-S-T-I-N-A, last name, G-O-V-A-S, and I've been many voices speaking to save Mercy Hospital since August.

Mismanagement is what caused Mercy Hospital closure to be entertained. Being hesitant and cautious at this time is prudent to ensure Mercy's future, a future which right now stands in the balance. The trust has been fractured between the community in access to health care, so it's imperative that we move forward cautiously to help heal this fractured trust. So proper vetting of buyers, all potential buyers, is crucial to ensure that this hospital continues to serve the community as its best capacity. Vetting must include if these buyers have the wherewithal and the knowledge to be able to uplift this community and this hospital, as well as explore potential conflicts of interest which may run deeply and may harm the community in the future. This community deserves access to full-service hospitals, including lifesaving acute services like obstetrics, STEMI, and stroke centers. This is who we have been fighting for and this is what we have been fighting for. We can see that Trinity has crippled this hospital, but Mercy still remains standing.

But Mercy is in critical condition, so whoever takes over this hospital needs to have Mercy and the patient population at its best interest. So we need to ensure that that is -- that transfer of power goes to someone who will do so. A clear assessment plan needs to be presented and agreed upon. The community needs this hospital, and they need it to function at its full capacity and strength. Please give the community time to make the right choice for Mercy Hospital. This is a very critical transfer and a very critical moment for Mercy Hospital. Please, please, please give enough time for people to do the right vetting so this way we can move forward and ensure that Mercy Hospital stays where it is and functioning at the capacity that we know it can.

We have thoroughgoing experience with Mercy Hospital, and we hope that it can remain open and functioning at full capacity serving our community. I support Insight's acquisition of the hospital, not because I think that a hasty transfer of power is something desirable, but because Mercy Hospital is clearly in a very critical position. And I cannot think of a better person and a better team, because I personally know of their integrity, to acquire control of the hospital. I totally respect the community's right to decide upon who the right buyer is, but I just want to go on record today saying, I believe Insight is the right group to acquire control of this hospital. I have worked with Insight in Flint, and I saw the way the community was invested in the institution.

And, you know, worked with me as a community partner. And when I think about that experience, I would love to see that experience replicated. I would love to see people in Bronzeville with a health care service provider that was similarly invested in their holistic best interest. So I go just want to go on record saying I support Insight's acquisition of this hospital, because I know of their integrity, the integrity of their leadership, and the excellence that their team has demonstrated in the past.

This is the last lifeline that Mercy Hospital has is Insight taking over. And Insight has -- if you actually do regular Google searches, you can vet them. Insight Institute of Neurosurgery and Neuroscience of Flint reopened a shuttered hospital in Lincoln Park to serve COVID patients. They didn't have to do that. That is something that they did graciously with a Block grant that they received. You know, one of their core values is integrity, teamwork, ethics, loyalty, innovation. They really want to help this community. And you can hear it with the passion that they have. If you look into their Michigan facilities, you can totally believe that their -- their mission and their vision will completely align with what the community needs. I don't agree that -- you know, people are over here saying that we need time, we need time. I'm sorry to say it, there is no more time. Trinity is trying to still close this hospital before the May 31st deadline.

So if you want any type of staff that know what they're doing in this hospital right now, it is critical to vote and allow Insight to take over for Trinity before there is no more of Mercy's basic core values here. So, please, I hope some of you actually on this call take this into consideration and understand that time is of the essence right now, and we have to get it going, and we have to move in the right direction. And these people, they've flipped hospitals that were in worse condition and made a profit. It's possible. Let them come in. Let them do their job, and I can guarantee you, you will see a positive outcome within the community. Thank you. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you.

My name is Mark Young. That's, M-A-R-K, Y-O-U-N-G. I'm county commissioner, and I'm currently the chairman of the Genesee County Board of Commissioners. Genesee County is also the home of the city of Flint, Michigan as well as the home of Insight Biomedical Technology Institute. I have had the great pleasure of serving my community and county for many years, and I appreciate individuals like Dr. Shah and organizations like Insight because of their outstanding commitment to our community. That is why I so enthusiastically support their efforts to operate the Mercy Hospital in Chicago. The Insight Biomedical Technology Institute has been an incredible boom to our local economy, but, more importantly, it has become a destination health care provider in my county. Their strong commitment to their patients, regardless of their ability to pay, has been very inspiring. I've had the pleasure of working with Insight as they have continued to invest throughout the region. I've watched and supported Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 81 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 their efforts to turn around a hospital in the neighboring community of Warren. We have also seen their commitment in our community with their redevelopment of the Broome Empowerment Village building, with a mission where they firmly believe that investing in young people is the key to creating compelling and lasting change without our community. As you can see, Insight does not simply invest in buildings, they invest in the community. Their investments in our county and the city of Flint have generated many needed jobs and have helped transform what had previously been an abandoned General Motors headquarters. Dr. Shah and Insight have been trustworthy allies in increasing access to necessary medical care in our county, and I thank them for their ongoing work in that area. I support Insight's work and application to save the Mercy Hospital in Chicago, which I understand is undergoing tremendous financial strain. We have seen this play out in many of our communities in Michigan, and we understand the frustration that the community must feel at the Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 82 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 prospect of losing this precious resource. However, I do believe that Insight is the right organization to run a facility that is sustainable and dedicated to its patients and hope that you will vote to allow Insight to take over this hospital. I support Insight's efforts to operate Mercy Hospital, and I ask the Health Facilities and Services Review Board to approve their application to do so. Thank you very much for your time.

Good morning, everybody. My name is Ben Saiyasombat, that's, B-E-N, S-A-I-Y-A-S-O-M-B-A-T. I'm one of the doctors who works in the emergency room at Mercy. As it stands right now during this day, I am in opposition of the change of ownership. As it's been said before, this was a rush decision, right. We've been -- we've been fighting to keep the hospital open for about a year. And the first we heard about Insight, there's been no transparency. The first we heard about them was essentially a week ago when Trinity Health put out the -- put out their notice that the sale was happening. However, they were sill -- they still fully intend to discontinue hospital services by May 31st, and they're holding the hospital closure over our heads unless this deal goes forward. I understand that the hospital closure does put pressure to find an approved entity as soon as possible, however, for the last year, we fought for the continuation of quality health care on the south side. We want Mercy Hospital not only to stay open but to stay viable and fully Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 84 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 supported. We want community members on the governing board that determines hospital operations, we want a hospital with an emergency room that takes all ambulances, as well as a fully-staffed intensive care unit, psychiatric floor, and high-risk OB unit. We want a health system that is fully committed to supporting the outpatient services which are so desperately needed by the community such as primary care, cancer screening, disease prevention, ob-gyn care, as well as behavioral and psychiatric health. And I believe that the best chance of making this happen would be to fully hear the proposals from all other parties that are interested in acquiring the hospital. If Trinity Health is serious about selling Mercy for a dollar, they should also agree to go to the table with these other organizations and elected officials as well as the community should be able to hear their plan. Agreeing to sell to the first entity that just happens to come along to prevent the closure of the hospital without properly considering the other options would be settling for the easy way Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 85 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 out. It would be a disservice to the community and how far the movement to save the hospital has come. I believe that, at this point in time, we are at a crossroads where there is an opportunity to truly effect long-lasting positive change in health care on the south side of Chicago, and we shouldn't be settling for anything less than that.

I'm a practicing internist, primary care doctor, and sleep specialist located on the south side of Chicago.

Many of my clinical skills that I rely on to this day were formed at Mercy. Many of my patients still go to Mercy. Just this week, my patient called me with lightheadedness and was sent to Mercy. Thankfully, she did well and was discharged home safely today, just before this call. Many of my mentors worked and practiced at Mercy. I would like to see them back and the rest of the physicians and staff who are committed to Mercy thrive and continue to work there and bring it back to its glory and beyond. We need Mercy Hospital to continue in our neighborhood for the safety of the community and, most importantly, to provide world-class quality care to its patients. We should not settle for a crippled hospital in which doctors cannot practice to the best of their abilities. But, first, Mercy Hospital needs financial stability. I have seen firsthand how finances interrupt taking care of residents and neighbors.

I was tired of being told that we could not afford state-of-the-art equipment that was not, quote, in our budget. I was honored to serve alongside my friends at KOCO, playing a very small role as the doctor for the hunger-striking residents who saved Dyett High School from closing, again, for, quote, financial reasons. The neighborhood deserves better. I have known Dr. Jawad Shah and Insight for 30 years, and I know how serious he is and Insight is about taking care of patients and running institutions with the highest levels of professionalism, integrity, and compassion. I think this is what we all want in the neighborhood. We want world-class care on the south side of Chicago and in Bronzeville. Insight can deliver that, our neighbors deserve that.

I've been seeing patients at Mercy for greater than 15 years. I also see patients at the University of Illinois where I'm an assistant professor, and I teach residents and students at both locations. I'm an asthma specialist. You know, I would encourage the Board to delay the exemption for change of ownership until there's really more clarity about what Insight wants to do with Mercy Hospital. I have no opinion about Insight, but the comments we've been receiving are that they would keep a basic ER which means no ambulances, you know, no really critical-ill patients, just walk-in patients.

They need primary care. I will give, you know -- I'll give more detail in a detailed written comment, but the community doesn't need more access just to surgery. They need access to the care that will keep them from requiring surgery, which is really good primary care, good social care. And there's still so many questions that are unanswered here. I really think it needs to be -- the vote needs to be -- the Board needs to delay the exemption, and we need to hear from other interested parties to hear their proposals, because we haven't really heard a proposal here.

At Insight, every day we bring skilled health care practitioners together across various disciplines and using a lot of technology that I haven't seen anywhere.

I think that it is very important that the members of that community, the patients, and the staff at Mercy have a say-so in that process and are able to review the information. There needs to be more research, there needs to be more research on other buyers that are willing to take over. Because just to make say rush decision and people would ultimately be affected, I think we wouldn't want to go with that decision. Just about a year ago, unfortunately, my mother was ill and was unable to go to the University of Chicago, and she had to go to Mercy, and they did a very good job.

I appreciate you allowing me to share my experience with Dr. Shah. I actually reside in the state of Indiana for the last 12 years. I was diagnosed with just a brain tumor initially. I never experienced that before. I have had immune system diseases for about 20 years. I did visit two brain surgeons in Chicago, both of them denied me of having surgery from them because I was considered a high-risk patient. So, you know, fast forward a couple months after meeting them, I unimaginably was connected to Dr. Shah. Let's see. Sorry. I have notes I'm going off of. I apologize. I just have a little note to share. As of this month, it's been five years that I found out I had a brain tumor. Prior to meeting with Dr. Shah, as I said, I met with the two surgeons in Chicago. Of course, something unexpected like having a brain tumor, most people might react with an undeniable fear of dying, and finding Dr. Shah in an unimaginable way proved that I found the right doctor for me.

In fact, the morning of surgery, I was calm, and I think it was because of him and his demeanor and my safety I felt with him. And maybe most people might not feel that way. I mean, from my experience, I walked out of the hospital after surgery in less than a week. It was a complete blessing. And it was with Dr. Shah saving my life. The tumor was tested and ended up being non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cancer. Having a few weeks of radiation and chemotherapy was a challenge, but my family, and especially Dr. Shah and his team, were always there for me. Since recovery in the last five years, it's not been easy. I thank God every day that I was strong enough to get through it, for Dr. Shah and the team who helped me get there. They are the unexpected blessing I will forever be grateful for. Based on everyone's comments and input, I have a strong belief as a patient that Insight would be contributing greatly to the Mercy Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 98 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Hospital. I honestly understand where there has been some conflict with other, you know, surgeons or communities that won't accept someone coming from out of state, but I feel like Dr. Shah has an extensive amount of surgery, is very well known. I feel, as a patient, I would respect him even more than I do with his reputation and, you know, his -- his team of doctors that he has connected to in the area of Flint were amazing to me. Their communication together was consistent in regards to my personal situation, and I couldn't be more happier with going with him as my surgeon. Again, thank you so much for letting me share my experience with Dr. Shah and the support of his team at Insight. Thank you. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you for your time and testimony. Mr. Lee, please proceed. MS. LEE: Good afternoon. This is Jaribu Lee. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: I'm sorry, ma'am. Thank you. MS. LEE: Okay. J-A-R-I-B-U. And my last name is Lee, L-E-E.

I'm also a part of the Kenwood-Oakland Community Organization and the Chicago Health Equity Coalition as well. And we started fighting for keeping Mercy Hospital open back in the summer when we heard abruptly, you know, that the hospital was going to be closed. And so we created a coalition of labor, health professionals, doctors, nurses, faith organizations to really fight back to make sure that this hospital was able to stay open. And, consistently, since the summer, the Coalition has been demanding that Trinity Health Systems sell Mercy. And it was made, you know, public about maybe, you know, two weeks ago, that that was the case. And so we're excited that, you know, we are on the track of keeping the hospital open, something that we've been fighting for for the last year. However, we're concerned about the fact that Trinity is -- is the one that's determining who the buyer will be. There are a number of other buyers that have expressed interest, and Trinity has resisted any other discussions with, you know, other Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 100 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 buyers. And so prior to the sale, we are clear that a public plan to restore Mercy to a fully-operational hospital with essential services be outlined. None of that has been, you know, submitted here. We also -- we support the sale of Mercy Hospital to a responsible entity that will make sure that there's transparency to the community that it serves, significant community representation on the board, and preservation of the full extent of Mercy Hospital's capabilities. And equity begins governance. You know, equity begins governance. We demand a process that ensures accountability to the public and shares governance here as well. We need to review and vet all interested buyers and have representation on the board. And so we are calling for this body to deny Trinity's -- this proposal to sell until all applications have been fully vetted. Thank you so much. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you for your time. Okay. Call-in user 27, you should be unmuted now.

My name is Terrance Jones, and I'm a patient of Dr. Shah's. And I've seen him since 2015 from a tragic car accident. My body was really pretty bad, and I came to Dr. Shah, and him and his staff have provided me with excellent care. And it was through coming through him and going through the rehabilitation center and physical therapy and finally getting surgery on my back that I was able to start getting up and walking again. Dr. Shah doesn't wear his doctor on his sleeve, he wears human being on his sleeve first. Because not only is he a great doctor and excellent physician, but he's a great human being. When we had the Flint water crisis, he was one of the first ones to invest his own money in trying to repair the pipes and fix up the neighborhoods. As you heard earlier, he's invested in the Sylvester Broome Empowerment Village where he's invested in the community and our youth in the community. He's invested in Flint, period. He's trying to do all he can to uplift the communities in Flint and bringing Flint back to the forefront. I am grateful to him what he has done for Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 102 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 me as an individual and helping me get -- start my life back on track. But I know that the residents that's in Chicago are very concerned about Mercy Hospital and who takes it over. And I understand what they're saying about don't rush to judgment on selling it. But I'm telling you that Dr. Shah is not only going to be invested in the hospital and his patients, but he's also going to be invested in the community of Chicago. He's going to do what he can when he can to help the community come up, as well as invest in the hospital with his staff to make sure that every patient has extreme personal care. Because when I had my surgery, he didn't let me leave -- until I woke up, he didn't let me leave until he came and spoke with me to make sure I was okay. My after care, he made sure I had the nurses come out to the hospital and took good care of me at my home to make sure I was up and moving. He has invested himself personally. He would have his assistant call me every day to check on me, see how I was doing. Dr. Shah didn't have to do none of this, but he did. He showed me that he is not only a great physician, as I said, Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 103 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 but a human being. And the people in Chicago have nothing to worry about. He's going to not only invest in that hospital, but he's going to invest in your community. And I just want to let everybody know that. Thank you for giving me the time to speak. THE REPORTER: Can you please spell your name for us? MR. JONES: T-E-R-R-A-N-C-E. J-O-N-E-S. THE REPORTER: Thank you.

And my point is that it's important that it be a full-service hospital and that there be no rush to judgment. Because the services that I received in the time that I spent at Mercy would not fall within the parameters of the kind of service that Insight provides. Insight sounds like a very fine organization, but the importance of having a full-service hospital in Bronzeville at Mercy, I consider to be extremely important. And I will spell my name. It's, M-A-R-I-A-N, last name, J-O-N-E-S. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you for your comments. MS. JONES: You're welcome. Thank you. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Have a good day.

But I am also a patient here at Mercy Hospital.

I'm sure that you can run into someone on any given day whom if they were not born here at Mercy, their children or relatives were or any person for any given reason have received some form of care here. With that being said, I pray for the group that will take over this hospital. I want to appeal to the minds, hearts, and spirits of whomever the investor may be, because we don't actually know whom that investor will be as of yet. We have not spoken with other investors as of yet. But we pray -- I pray that it continues to be to a full-service hospital with a full-service emergency room, gyne, psych ward, ICU, cardiology, oncology, inpatient, internal medicine, labs, the imaging department, and pharmacy, among other services that are needed. I can speak on these services because I have doctors in many of these areas. It is by coincidence that I mentioned the psych ward and Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 107 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 full-service emergency room coming back because due to the closing of these areas, a young lady who was in this area who is mentally challenged injured herself. And after receiving emergency health care elsewhere had to be transferred to Ingalls psych ward in Harvey, Illinois. That's a prime example of why need these units opened immediately. Some patients have been forced to go to other hospitals due to these closures. It is things like this happening which is why we definitely need a voice, representation, on what should happen when it comes to our health care. I think that it was outrageous that after being a patient for over ten years at Mercy, Trinity Corporation did not even respect us enough to let us know that it was closing. We had to find this out through the Chicago Health Equity Coalition and on Facebook. This told us that they didn't really care one way or the other. We just heard them talk about profits. And when you place profits over people, we have a problem. What we don't need is another group coming into our community who really Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 108 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 puts profits over people. What we also do not need is to make rush decisions on what investor will come into our community. Because if you take the time to conversate with us, the Chicago Health Equity Coalition and the people in the community that you will be serving, then you can make a proper decision on this matter. We deserve proper health care. We deserve to live. And we will continue to fight to get proper health care to whomever the investor may be. Work with us, and we'll work with you. But, again, we will not and should not be rushed. And while speaking out about investors, I also have to speak to the mind, hearts, and spirits of our government who should be making sure that our safety net hospitals are fully funded and back up whatever investors come in so that we will not have to continue with the closings of these safety net hospitals. We can make this hospital work for the people that it serves, so don't be afraid to have input into -- let us have input into our health care. It is all about helping us to help you, because it works when you do it together. We have Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 109 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 been sold out long enough. And if you're truly for our community, then you will give us the time to communicate with you and others. Bringing this hospital back to its full capacity is going to be a process. We need to bring back doctors, nurses, and other medical staff who have been truly -- who have truly given of themselves to serve our communities who have been gotten rid of by the Trinity Corporation. This means taking our time and talking with other investors and choosing the right investor to represent us. There is nothing that we can't do if we do it together, but rush decisions are not good decisions. While I've heard some good things about Insight from friends and relatives who live in Flint, Michigan and I've heard them once again, we still need to make the best decision for what we think is right for us and to make Mercy Hospital the best hospital ever, better than ever. Thank you so much. HEARING OFFICER AVERY: Thank you, Ms. Davis. Okay. Let me do one quick sweep, Mr. Morado, and then you can go. Okay.

MR. BAWAHAB: Good afternoon, everyone. My name is a Atif Bawahab. I am the chief strategy officer of Insight. First and foremost, just grateful for the opportunity to address you all today. I appreciate the opportunity of being able to tell you about us, who we are, the work we've done in the communities that we've served, as well as the health and economic development of the results of our work. Similarly, we really appreciate the opportunity and, in fact, humbled by hearing from the public, the community members, the Mercy employees, all of the diverse stakeholders that we're looking forward to serving firsthand. We understand your questions, your comments, and your concerns. Not one comment was the same, but the one thing that really resonated with me, as well as my team, is the passion in everyone's voices. I know there's no video or visual for everyone today, but we can definitely hear that, so much passion in everyone's voices that truly means that all of you Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 111 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 guys care about the hospital, the community, and I would like to think that means that you guys all share our core value of love. I don't think we can respond to all the comments today, but a couple of responses I would like to make with respect to the process. I've heard that, you know, the community feels like this was rushed, it happened overnight. For us, it's been the complete contrary. This has been a long and extended process, one that we've been engaged in since last summer. And it's included a thorough vetting by Trinity, even site visit to our Flint facilities as well. So we'd like to think we've gone through a very thorough vetting process and have embarked on the same channels as every other interested party has gone through, and one in which, from my understanding, Trinity has been embarking upon for the past couple of years in terms of transitioning this hospital. With respect to the communication with the public or should I say, rather, lack of communication that the public feels, please understand, as part of the negotiations, we had a Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 112 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 nondisclosure agreement with Trinity, so that's prohibited us from having any type of public discussions. But as soon as that NDA was lifted, we began having conversations with community organizations, elected officials, the Chicago Health Equity Coalition. And although that's only happened since the past week, we're looking forward to several more conversations in the coming weeks and months ahead. I would go even further in terms of our communication. If I humbly could really challenge anyone that has reached out to us and has not received a direct response from us and not just from our overall team but from myself and Dr. Shah, personally. We're engaging everyone and looking forward to that involvement. But, like I said, one week is not enough. We're looking forward to this engagement in the coming months and years ahead. We take this responsibility very seriously. I would say obligation very seriously. There's a lot of work to be done. This hospital has such a rich history and has been such a longstanding pillar in the community. It will not Transcript of Public Hearing Conducted on March 12, 2021 113 PLANET DEPOS 888.433.3767 | WWW.PLANETDEPOS.COM1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 be a short-term project. But we see this as a very long-term commitment to make this a center of excellence. And we really mean that word, excellence. We're not looking at this as a hospital just to do the bare minimum or just to simply get by. To borrow the words of the community, we want this hospital to thrive and not just survive. And looking at this as a center of excellence that includes a full-service hospital, but so much more than that, product development, research, education. But, again, we don't believe that we're going to be successful in this endeavor independently. We're looking for support, engagement with the community, and looking forward to collaborating with everyone. If there are other interested parties, we would love to hear from you, see how we can engage with one another, and work with us as partners in rebuilding such a solid institution in the community. Again, thank you for the time today and for having the opportunity to listen to you all. We humbly ask for your patience and, more importantly, your support.
