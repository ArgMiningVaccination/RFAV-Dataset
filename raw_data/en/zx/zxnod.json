CooneyEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / JUNE 2015 III EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015 III Ethics: The ethics of agent compensation Recently, individuals in the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association, the governing body of football/soccer, were indicted for accepting bribes to decide who would get to provide services to FIFA, such as hosting its quadrennial tournament and televising matches. Such kickbacks are considered fraud and if found guilty, the indicted individuals will be convicted of corruption. Such cases occur with alarming frequency. For example, in June 2015, five New Jersey medical professionals were indicted and charged with acc epting bribes and kickbacks for referring patients for imaging services. These charges, if sustained, carry maximum sentences of 20 to 25 years in prison. In the April 2015 issue of Equine Veterinary Education (Nyrop, K, The Veterinarian's Role in Referral of Equine Cases , EVE, 2015: 27(4): iii-iv), Dr. Karen Nyrop presented the ethical issues surrounding veterinarians and the referral of equine patients. However, non-veterinarians are also often involved in selecting veterinary services. When owners who are absent, or for whatever reason are unable to select their provider of veterinary services, proxy agents such as farm managers, trainers and bloodstock agents often direct where, and by whom, veterinary services will be delivered. When agents request or expect some form of payment, either directly in cash or in veterinary goods and services, for the opportunity to provide veterinary services to the agents' clients, veterinari-ans are faced with an ethical challenge. The outright payment of money from a veterinary practice to an equine entity (farm, training center, etc.) or person in exchange for providing veterinary services is unethical and may be illegal in some jurisdictions. Such payment violates the requirement to deal honestly with clients and colleagues. The client relies upon the advice of the veteri-narian on matters of referral and prescribing. All referrals and prescriptions must be based on the skill and quality of the veterinarian to whom the patient has been referred or the quality and efficacy of the drug or product prescribed. In some instances where third parties are involved, there may be expectations of quid pro quo. For example, in exchange for working on horses in a training barn, there may be an expectation that the trainers' personal horse(s) will be treated at a reduced rate. Here, the ethics can be more ambiguous. Veterinarians are certainly free to provide their services at a reduced rate to agents as a pro-fessional courtesy as long as the shortfall is not passed on to other clients. When clients know about agreements that may affect their horse or bill, ethical concerns are mitigated as long as the clients are aware and have the option of opting out of them. Cost sharing of veterinary services for horses with multiple owners is ethically acceptable, as long as the client is aware of what proportion of the bill they are paying. If a trainer who is a part-owner has an arrangement with the other owners that they will pay all veterinary fees, that understanding should be put in writing so there can be no misunderstandings. Arrangements for agents to pay all veterinary charges and individually bill clients with added fees for patient shipping, treatment or bill processing are acceptable as long as the client is fully informed and has the option of directly paying the veterinary fees. The issue of communi-cation between veterinarians, owners and agents can be complicated because the expectations of owners about being kept informed can vary greatly. When there is doubt, a veterinarian should err on the side of over-communica-tion with owners. The veterinarian should communicate adequate information and explanation about the payment arrangement and should provide reasonable alternatives. A third-party payment arrangement should be refused if it prevents the veterinarian from providing professional services that are necessary or if it encourages the provision of professional services that are unnecessary.In competitive veterinary environments such as the racetrack, big show and performance horse barns, and breeding farms, the temptation to agree to agents' requests for financial accommodations or payments in return for access to their clients' veterinary work can be severe, but must be resisted. A better grasp of both the ethical and legal ramifications of such arrangements can help equine veterinarians respond to and withstand those pressures.

Thirty-seven practitioners immersed themselves in intensive, hands-on training at a 360\u00b0 meeting. During 360\u00b0 Diagnosing, Imaging and Treating from the Foot to the Fetlock at Colorado State University, attendees mastered diagnostic techniques of the distal extremity, in which up to 90% of all lamenesses occur. At 360\u00b0 Ophthalmology at the University of Florida, attendees learned to recognize ocular diseases and perform appropri-ate intervention techniques for common to difficult cases.Nearly 220 practitioners participated in an evidence-based Focus meeting. During Focus on Ambulatory Medicine in Minneapolis, Minn., the road warriors of equine practice strengthened their abilities to perform field exams, triage emergencies and optimize their time, income and technology. At Focus on Poor Performance in Lexington, Ky., attendees enhanced their capacity to assess, diagnose and treat the variety of performance-limiting diseases more efficiently.Meanwhile, Focus on Students, held in conjunction with Focus on Ambulatory Medicine, provided 23 students with interactive labs, professional development and networking opportunities. Details about next summer's slate of AAEP continuing education meetings will be available soon at www.aaep.org/info/education. Intensive, hands-on training is a staple of AAEP 360\u00b0 meetings. Touch Point: Don't overlook young horse owners for practice growth Amanda House, DVM, DACVIM Young horse owners (18-40 years) may present an overlooked opportunity for veterinarians seeking to grow their practices, according to AAEP market research. Not only do these young owners provide the most long-term opportunity for business, but their above-average involvement in the horse industry adds to their prospective customer value. Compared with older horse owners, those aged 18-40 are more involved in the horse industry and their horses see an equine veterinarian more frequently. These owners also put as much as or more emphasis on relationship-oriented attributes as they do on their veterinarian's knowledge and experience. Demonstrating compassion, taking time with the horse, explaining diagnoses and having a pleasant demeanor are char-acteristics that the younger owner places a higher importance on than older owners. With lower incomes than older owners, the 18-40 segment is the most cost-sensitive but also the most likely to increase their already frequent usage of veterinarians. Young owners are the most likely to expect to increase their usage of veterinarian services over the next few years (8% vs. 5% for those over 40), pointing to stricter regulations at horse shows and plans to do more preventive care and breeding in the future. Read the complete Touch research report at touch.aaep.org to obtain more informa- tion about the preferences of this important client group. The bottom line: young horse owners can contribute to your practice's bottom line if you take the time to understand the attributes they most value in veterinary relationships and services. EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015 V Equine career opportunities exist within the federal government The federal government plays a key role in the health and welfare of horses. Much of the responsibility for this important work rests with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). One program that focuses on the welfare of horses is the USDA APHIS Animal Care - Horse Protection Program. Under the authority of the Horse Protection Act (HPA), the USDA works with the industry to prevent the practice of \"soring.\" Soring produces an accentuated gait with less training effort and over a shorter period of time, giving the individual showing a sored horse an unfair advantage over those showing sound horses. The practice of soring is accomplished by irritating or blistering a horse's forelegs through the application of chemicals or the use of mechanical devices. Congress passed the HPA in 1970, finding and declaring that the soring of horses is cruel and inhumane, and that sored horses, when shown or exhibited, compete unfairly with horses that have not been sored. The Horse Protection Program employs equine professionals, known as veterinary medical officers and animal care inspectors. These professionals work as part of inspection teams to attend horse events that may have a heightened risk of horses showing signs of soring or other violations of the HPA and/or federal regulations. Veterinary medical officers use diagnostic technology (ther- mography, digital radiography, foreign substance swabbing, blood sampling), observation and palpation to examine any horse for signs of soring or other violations of the HPA and/or federal regulations. Animal care inspectors work in the inspection process by assisting with diagnostic technology, collection of evidence (photography, videography, records), and individual identification of horses via iris scanning. The Horse Protection Program utilizes both full time and intermittent field-based employees located throughout the 50 states to accomplish its mission and facilitate the enforcement of the HPA. Intermittent employment oppor-tunities are located in states near locations of horse shows, sales, auctions or exhibits that may show concerns of soring. Professionals interested in helping the Horse Protection Program with its mission to end the practice of soring can find employment opportunities listed when available at www.USAJobs.gov. The USDA APHIS Animal Care - Horse Protection Program will have an outreach booth within the trade show at the AAEP's 61st Annual Convention in Las Vegas this December. Please stop by booth 4033 to learn more about career opportunities with the federal government.

Equine mammary tumours are rare, but when they occur they are usually aggressively invasive, resulting in a grave prognosis for the mare. This study examined the clinical, histopathological and molecular characteristics of a series of equine mammary tumours and con rmed previous mammary tumours have a malignant phenotype. Findings paralleled those of some earlier case reports suggesting that there was frequently a clinical suspicion of mastitis at the time of initial presentationand examination of the mare. Immuno fluorescence and immunohistochemistry were used to demonstrate expression of oestrogen receptor status, which is one of the mainstays of human breast cancer diagnostics, and is increasingly used in the assessment of canine and feline mammary tumours. Nuclear expression of the transcription factor STAT3 was also assessed as a read-out of STAT3 activity. STAT3 is frequently over-expressed in tumours, including in many cases of human breast cancer. The study demonstrated that different subsets of equine tumours expressed different patterns of oestrogen receptor and nuclear STAT3 expression, and additionally showed that STAT3 expression may be inversely correlated with that of cytokeratin 14, a basal marker, suggesting that in equine mammary tumours STAT3 is more frequently expressed in luminal type tumours. This investigation gives insights into the molecular characteristics of these poorly de ned tumours, and with further studies, this data may in the future help to inform prognostication. However, given the scarcity of equine mammary tumours, further multicentre investigations will be necessary to accumulate adequate case material for any such prognostic or molecular relationships to be suf ciently interrogated. Perioperative buprenorphine or butorphanol This prospective clinical trial by Polly Taylor and colleagues in the UK set out to compare the analgesic and physiological properties of buprenorphine with those of butorphanol when used perioperatively. The 89 horses in this study, all undergoing elective surgery, received either butorphanol or buprenorphine after sedation with ana2agonist (usually romi dine) and the assessor was masked to which of the two partial agonists was being used. General anaesthesia was induced with ketamine and diazepam, reflecting a realistic clinical practice setting. The assessor recorded a score on a 4-point scale for the quality of sedation following opioid administration, the quality of recovery after general anaesthesia and the degree of sedation, ataxia and perceived pain after recovery. Gastrointestinal sounds and faecal output were also recorded. One clinic used lower doses of both buprenorphine (5 g/kg bwt) and butorphanol (0.02 mg/kg bwt) compared with those used in other clinics (10 g/kg bwt and 0.1 mg/kg bwt, respectively). These 'low'and 'high 'dose subgroups were compared in the statistical analysis. During anaesthesia, no signi cant differences in physiological parameters, including mean arterial bloodpressure, were noted between the two opioids. Surgicalconditions were recorded as excellent in over 80% of horses in both groups, with no signi cant difference between them. Isoflurane requirements for maintenance of anaesthesia were unaffected by the opioid used. There was no difference in the quality or duration of recovery from anaesthesia between the two groups, at either low or high doses. Post operatively, pain scores were signi cantly improved in horses receiving buprenorphine compared with butorphanol. Of the small number of cases requiring supplementary 'rescue 'analgesia post operatively, more had received butorphanol. There was no difference between the opioid groups in relation to post operative sedation and ataxia. When the two subgroups of low and high doses were compared, analgesia was signi cantly better with buprenorphine at 10 g/kg dose compared with butorphanol, but no difference was observed when buprenorphine was used at the lower dose. The authors exercise caution in interpreting this result as this part of the study was under-powered. The incidence of side effects post operatively, including gastrointestinal disturbance, was low in both groups, but box-walking appeared a more common occurrence where buprenorphine had been used. When given as part of premedication, buprenorphine provides superior analgesia compared with butorphanol in horses undergoing general anaesthesia and elective surgery. The most appropriate dose of buprenorphine to maximise analgesic properties while minimising side effects warrants further investigation. Equine metabolic syndrome and weight loss This study by Ruth Morgan and colleagues in the UK evaluated the ef cacy of a weight loss and exercise plan employed by owners under veterinary guidance for treatment of equine metabolic syndrome (EMS). On admission to the participating clinics, each horse underwent clinical examination, body condition scoring (BCS), basal ACTH blood sample and a combined glucose- insulin tolerance test. Horses with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction were excluded from the study. Median BCS at the start of the study was 4.5/5. An individual dietary and exercise regime was created for each of the 19 horses in this study. Recommendations included weighing all feed, feeding 1.5% bodyweight in fresh weight of hay (preferably soaked) and using a commercial balancer to maintain suf cient levels of vitamins, minerals and protein. Recommendations on turnout and exercise were also devised tot with the owner 's management system. During the study period, several reassessments of the horse 's condition were made by the initial treating clinician. Owners were also encouraged to keep in regular contact between assessments allowing ne adjustments to be made to the diet and exercise plan where necessary. At the nal assessment, the examination and blood tests were repeated for each horse. All horses showed a reduction in BCS (median change 1/5) and 95% had a reduction in body mass. When the results of the repeated combined glucose-insulin tolerance tests were compared to results at the beginning of the study, signi cant decreases were observed in several measures, including basal insulin, insulin at 45 min, time for glucose to \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd501 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015reach baseline and area under the glucose curve. These results represent an improvement in insulin sensitivity within the study population. This study shows that signi cant levels of weight loss can be achieved in the treatment of EMS by using tailored weight loss and exercise plans and regular clinician contact. Alternative treatment for R. equi pneumonia In this controlled randomised prospective study, Noah Cohen and colleagues in the USA investigated gallium maltolate as an alternative to macrolides for treatment of presumed Rhodococcus equi pneumonia in foals. Macrolide-resistant isolates of R. equi are emerging, prompting the search for clinically effective alternative antimicrobials. This study compared the proportion of foals with evidence of R. equi pneumonia that had a successful outcome when administered gallium maltolate (GaM) per os with that of foals receiving standard treatment. Fifty-four foals with ultrasonically identi ed pulmonary abscesses >1 cm in diameter were randomly allocated to receive per os either clarithromycin combined with rifampin (CLR +R) or GaM, and followed up for 28 days by daily physical inspections and weekly or biweekly thoracic ultrasound examinations. Resolution of pulmonary abscesses within 28 days of initiating treatment was de ned as treatment success and noninferiority was de ned as a 90% CI for the observed difference in CLR +Rm i n u sG a Mt h a tw a s 10%. The proportion of GaM-treated foals that resolved (70%; 14/20) was similar +R was not shown; however, when results from a noncompliant farmwere excluded GaM was noninferior to CLR +R treatment. The authors therefore suggest that gallium maltolate is not inferior to macrolides for treating foals with subclinical pneumonia and GaM usage might reduce pressure for macrolide- resistance in R. equi . Cervical wedge resection to treat pyometra In this study, Carolyn Arnold and colleagues in the USA report on the use of cervical wedge resection for treatment of pyometra secondary to transluminal cervical adhesions. Five of the 6 mares in this study were admitted to hospital for infertility and one for acute colic. Palpation per rectum of the reproductive tract of all 6 mares revealed uterine distention, and transrectal ultrasonography con rmed the presence of echogenic fluid accumulation within the uterus. Cervical palpation during vaginal speculum examination indicated transluminal cervical adhesions. Three mares had severe distortion of the cervix as a result of diverticula and brosis. All 6 mares had a diagnosis of pyometra secondary to transluminal cervical adhesions. Initially, the cervical adhesions were manually broken down to establish a patent cervical lumen to accommodate a uterine lavage catheter. A sample of the uterine content was obtained for bacteriological culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and the uterus was lavaged with 0.05% povidone-iodine solution to remove the mucopurulent exudate. Cervical surgery was performed in standing mares following sedation and caudal epidural anaesthesia. A full- thickness wedge-shaped defect was made in the dorsolateral aspect of the cervix, creating a permanent opening to the uterus. Topical medication was applied to the cervix postoperatively to reduce the recurrence of adhesion formation. All 6 mares had patent cervices and resolution of pyometra following surgery. In this study, cervical wedge resection enabled treatment of pyometra in mares with transluminal cervical adhesions, without the need for ovariohysterectomy. Management of caecal impaction This retrospective study by Maia Aitken and colleagues in theUSA aimed to evaluate short- and long-term outcome after medical and surgical management of horses with caecal impaction and to determine reasons for death or euthanasia. Data were collected from medical records of horses with a diagnosis of caecal impaction. Short-term (alive or dead at discharge) and long-term (alive or dead at 1 year) outcome were obtained by telephone interview. Of 150 horses hospitalised with a diagnosis of caecal impaction, 102 (68%) had a history of recent disease or a surgical procedure; 38 (25%) had caecal perforation at admission and 3 (2%) were subjected to euthanasia without treatment. Of 109 horses treated, 59 (54%) were managed medically and 50 (46%) surgically (26 typhlotomy; 24 jejunocolostomy). A signi cantly lower proportion of horses alive at hospital discharge were managed medically (61%) compared with surgically (82%) but there was no difference between horses managed with typhlotomy alone (77%) or with jejunocolostomy (88%). After one year, 57% of medically managed horses were alive. A similar proportion of horses were alive at one year after typhlotomy alone (73%) and jejunocolostomy (70%). Compared with recent reports, the proportion of horses alive at hospital discharge was lower for both medically and surgically managed horses with caecal impaction. There was decreased survival for horses treated medically than those treated surgically; however, no signi cant difference was seen in survival between horses managed with typhlotomy alone vs. jejunocolostomy.

A leadingexample is restrictive nosebands. Thirty years ago, nosebands on bridles were largely aesthetic rather than functional but, as any British Horse Society instructor of my vintage and earlier will con rm, their tightness was routinely checked. Nowadays, nosebands are being tightened so much in some equestrian competitions that checking is considered too controversial to be undertaken. As a result, horses are suffering stress, reduced blood flow in the area and ultimately even deformed nasal bones. The horse 's mouth never evolved to accommodate a bit and there is no convenient space for one in the buccal cavity. So it is easy to see why a horse would need to move its tongue and mandible while wearing a regular snaf fle bit. When we add the second bit of a double bridle, we can expect more of such movements and when the rider takes the reins to make contact, the horse needs to adjust further as it seeks comfort. Excellent equestrian technique relies on steady and sensitive hands that give clear cues and avoid the application of relentless pressure. In dressage, judges reward tactful riding in the scores they assign for so-called submission -a notoriously subjective collection of marks on which judges often disagree (Hawson et al. 2010). Submission scores include lightness of contact through the reins and they are one of the few ways good horse welfare can be celebrated in competition. Some argue that modern dressage horses look less relaxed than their counterparts of yesteryear. Certainly, there is more poll flexion than there used to be and more con flict at the level of mouths (Lashley et al. 2014). It is an established principle of ethical equitation that the horse 's relaxation must be benchmarked (McGreevy and McLean 2007; Anon 2011). This entails training lightness of reincontact by carefully eliminating expressions of mouth discomfort, such as opening, gaping or crossing the jaw. The rules of dressage anticipate that horses will open their mouths unless ridden lightly. When a horse opens its mouth to evade the bit, one short-term response by riders and trainers is to use a noseband to keep the mouth tightly closed. In a recent statement, Trond Asmyr, the Director of the F /C19ed/C19eration Equestre Internationale of Dressage, said, 'The FEI is currently looking into all the aspects of nosebands, including possible ways of measuring tightness 'and further stated, 'The FEI rules previously included guidelines which stated that it should be possible to put two ngers under the noseband. This was a very imprecise measurement, due to different nger sizes of persons who did the checks and also how they were used. As a result, this sentence was removed '. Many equestrian manuals and competition rule books propose that 'two ngers 'be used as a spacer to guard against overtightening but fail to specify where these should be applied or, indeed, the size of ngers.The problems Sadly, the practice of restricting jaw movement has become entrenched ( Fig 1 ), as it prevents the horse from opening its mouth, which, in dressage, is regarded as a sign of resistance or lack of compliance and attracts rider penalties. A paradox: rules that penalise evidence of rough riding (e.g. mouth opening) have prompted development of gadgets that mask such evidence. By design, such tight nosebands restrict virtually all normal horse jaw and tongue movements primarily to avoid competition penalties. A recent study showed that as noseband tightness increases, there seems to be an elevation in sensitivity to the bit, presumably because it becomes more uncomfortable (Randle and McGreevy 2011). Some riders may also feel they have more control when the noseband is tighter and the horse seems to become more 'submissive '. Recent evidence suggests that horses wearing tight nosebands undergo a physiological stress response and may have reduced blood flow (McGreevy et al. 2012). Consequently, on welfare grounds, the use of nosebands that constrict and have potential to cause injuries should not be permitted in training or competition. There is also growing evidence of micro-fractures and bony changes that result from long-term use. Damage to the medial aspect of the buccal mucosa may eventuate when it is pushed against sharp molars ( Fig 2 ) but this should not be remedied solely by rasping the teeth. Veterinarians acknowledge that removing parts of the horse because they do not suit the rider 's purpose is dif cult to defend. Tight nosebands can mask behaviour in horses that might be indicative of either pain or de ciencies in training or, indeed, both. The pursuit of good horsemanship is undermined when arti cial aids substitute for, or exaggerate genuine riding skills. While such tactics and aids may help individual competitors, they may not bene t the sport overall, neither its supporters nor the horses. Fig 1: Nosebands have become very tight and the padding they require to avoid decubitus unfortunately pushes more of thecheek AE / OCTOBER 2015The solutions In most equestrian disciplines, gear stewards check that all equipment used on competing horses complies with the speci ed regulations. Given that overtightened nosebands put so much pressure on nose and mouth areas that they cause distress and injuries, the International Society for Equitation Science (ISES) has recently made a number of relevant recommendations for equestrian competition organisers. The ISES recommends that the practice of leaving a two nger-sized gap under the noseband to demonstrate that it has not been overtightened is reinstated. If this is made an ofcial part of competition rules, riders will comply. The International Society for Equitation Science has developed a simple standard taper gauge that can be used to measure the gap under the noseband in a fair, objective andconsistent way. Such a gap allows horses to express tension or seek relief from bit pressure, making competition a far more comfortable experience for them. Allowing riders to benchmark their horses 'relaxation is a principle of what ISES calls ethical equitation. The practice of overtightening nosebands to avoid penalties in competition covers up poor training at the expense of horse welfare. By instituting rules and standards to ensure nosebands are not overtightened, horse sport organisations will not only alleviate horse suffering but also promote excellent training. P. D.

The use of a specimen retrieval bag prevented contamination of the abdomen and incision with tumour cells during activation of the morcellator. Introduction The granulosa cell tumour (GCT) is the most common ovarian neoplasm in mares and is most often unilateral, benign and associated with alteration in behaviour due to active hormone secretion from the tumour cells (Watson 1999; McKinnon and Barker 2010; McCue 2013). Other presentations exist, including neoplasia of both ovaries and metastatic disease (Gift et al. 1992; Patrick et al. 2003). Recommended treatment for GCT in horses is surgicalremoval of the affected ovary or ovaries (McCue et al. 2006). This removes the source of abnormal hormone secretion, eliminates behavioural changes and allows the remaining ovary, in unilateral conditions, to return to normal cyclic activity (McCue et al. 2006; Ball et al. 2013). Diagnosis of this tumour is made by transrectal ultrasonography and analysis of hormone levels in blood, which often reveal increased testosterone, inhibin, follicle- stimulating hormone and anti-M \u20acullerian hormone concentrations, decreased progesterone concentration and highly variable luteinising hormone concentration (McCueet al. 2006; Ball et al. 2013). Techniques to remove the GCT include colpotomy, laparotomy and laparoscopy (Embertson 2012). Due to variations of size of the mass which can be as large as 30 -40 cm in diameter, when performing surgery through the flank, modi cation of surgical procedures is required to facilitate large tumour extraction inthe relatively small paralumbar fossa of the horse (R \u20acocken et al. 2011; Vitte et al. 2014). Surgical modi cations adapted to tumours for extraction include motorised et al. 2010; Kummer et al. Embertson 2012). Staged surgical procedures with standing pedicle resection followed by tumour removal via ventral midline celiotomy under general anaesthesia, have been used for large ovarian tumours(R\u20acocken et al. 2011). Plastic specimen retrieval bags facilitate removal in the standing horse, limiting incision size as the operator 's hand can be removed from the incision during 'in bag 'extraction (Seltzer and Yarbrough 1998; De Bont et al. 2010). While morcellation is considered an appropriate technique for debulking, there is concern that during the use of the morcellator, tumour tissue can be seeded into the abdominal cavity or the incision if a specimen retrieval bag is not used. This case report describes a technique of hand- assisted laparoscopic removal of large ovarian masses with small flank incisions, using a morcellator with the ovarian mass contained within a sterile bag, thus preventing loss of tumour cells and fluid. Case 1 An 11-year-old Holsteiner mare presented with a history of stallion-like behaviour of 2 months 'duration. The mare had undergone two prior emergency exploratory celiotomies for large colon displacement colic 3 years prior to admission. She subsequently developed a 30 cm ventral midline hernia and underwent repair by direct suturing one year prior toadmission. Clinical ndings Transrectal ultrasound revealed an enlarged right ovary, approximately 20 cm in diameter, with evidence of multiple follicular structures and a solitary 10 cm diameter hypoechoic cavity. The left ovary was small and inactive. Hormone analysis was suggestive of a GCT: testosterone (reference range range 0.1 -0.7 ng/ml)1and progesterone 0.47 ng/ml (levels consistent with absence of active luteal tissue, reference 0.5 ng/ml)1. Diagnosis Based on behavioural changes, size and appearance of the ovary with ultrasound and hormone pro le, a GCT of the right ovary was diagnosed. However, due to the presence of a 6 cm hernia along the ventral midline, surgery in this area of the abdomen was avoided. The owners also wished to avoid general anaesthesia. Therefore, a standing laparoscopic technique was proposed using a paralumbar fossa approach and morcellator with the ovary contained in a specimen retrieval bag. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd505 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015Treatment Food was withheld from the patient for 24 h prior to surgery but free access to water was allowed. Presurgical bloodwork was performed including complete blood cell count and diagnostic pro le analysis. No signi cant abnormalities were noted. A catheter was placed in the jugular vein for administration of cefazolin (11 mg/kg bwt intravenously [i.v.] q. h), gentamicin (6.6 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 24 h for 48 h) and flunixin (1.1 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 12 h for 48 h). The patient was sedated with 4 lg/kg bwt detomidine and a sacrococcygeal epidural performed using 40 mg morphine diluted to a 20 ml volume with 0.9% saline. Subsequent sedation was provided using detomidine administered as a variable rate infusion to effect (5.5 -7.5lg/kg bwt/h). The rectum was evacuated and the right flank clipped, prepared for aseptic surgery, portal sites anaesthetised with 2% lidocaine (10 ml per site) and the patient draped prior to surgery. Laparoscopic portals are depicted in Figure 1 .A n1 1m m incision was made in the right flank for placement of a 11 mm diameter, 20 cm length laparoscopic cannula and blunt obturator (L1) positioned at the level of the ventral aspect of the tuber coxae , between the tuber coxae and last rib. A 10 mm diameter, 30 \u00b0, 57 cm length rigid laparoscope (Hopkins Telescope 62032BP)2was then inserted and the abdomen insuf flated with CO 2with intra-abdominal pressure maintained between 10 and 12 mmHg. Two further portals were similarly created; one was 7 cm ventral to the rst portal (L2) and one 5 cm dorsal/5 cm cranial to the rst portal (L3). The laparoscope was transferred to L3 and the right ovary examined ( Fig 2 ). A 19 gauge, 45 cm length laparoscopic needle (SD161919)3was introduced through L1 to perform local anaesthesia of the mesovarium with 30 mllidocaine. Laparoscopic acute traumatic forceps (SD1605845) 3of 45 cm length were used to grasp the ovary through L2 and a 37 cm length tissue sealing device(Ligasure) 4introduced through L1. The mesovarium, mesosalpinx and proper ligament of the ovary were then transected with the tissue sealing device. Haemorrhage was not observed following transection.A sterile bag (Ziploc Freezer 2 Gallon)5, rolled tightly, was introduced into the abdominal cavity in the L1 location. The bag was sterilised using the following method. The bag seal was opened prior to folding and insertion into a heat-sealed low temperature sterilisation pouch, the pouch then underwent hydrogen peroxide vaporisation (VHPMD140X Sterilizer)6, a chemical indicator strip (VH2O2 Indicator Strip GPS-250R)7which changes colour when exposed to hydrogen peroxide concentration over a speci ed time interval according to manufacturer 's instructions con rmed sterility prior to use. The size of the tumour precluded placement into the bag with laparoscopic instrumentation alone, therefore laparoscopic portals L1 and L2 were sharply connected creating a laparotomy incision of 8 cm total length ( Fig 1 ). A hand was introduced through the paralumbar incision and the ovary manipulated into the bag. The edges of the bag were withdrawn through the paralumbar incision and a morcellator with 15 mm rotating cutting blade (Rotocut G1)2used to extract the ovary ( Fig 3 ). The ovary was completely removed after several passes of Fig 1: Laparoscopic portal locations to include initial insertion portal and that used for mesovarium local anaesthesia andvessel sealing (L1), portal for introduction of acute traumaticforceps for manipulation of the GCT and (L3) primary portal forrigid laparoscope introduction. The line of arrows indicates thesite of connection of portals for hand-assistance and ovarywithdrawal prior to morcellation.

The ovary was reduced in size approximately 70% by morcellation and fluid evacuation prior to removal. Surgical gloves were changed following removal. The paralumbar incision was injected with 10 ml bupivacaine prior to closure. The supporting fascia of the internal and external abdominal oblique muscles layers was separately sutured with 0 polyglyconate (Maxon)4in a simple continuous pattern. Subcutaneous tissues were opposed with 2-0 synthetic glycomer (Biosyn)4in a simple continuous pattern. Skin was sutured with 0 polypropylene (Surgipro)4in a continuous vertical mattress pattern. Surgical time was 120 min. An adherent dressing (Coviderm)4was applied to protect the surgical site post operatively. Flunixin was continued every 12 h (1.1 mg/kg bwt i.v.) for 48 h after surgery and then reduced to every 24 h administration (1.1 mg/kg bwt per os ) for 3 days. The mare recovered well and was discharged from the hospital 72 h after surgery. Outcome Four months after surgery, the mare had a full recovery from behavioural signs and complete incisional healing. This was determined by interview of the caregivers and referring veterinarian. The mare was back in full work of dressage training and the barn manager was pleased with her demeanour. The referring veterinarian examined the mare and reported that the incision was well healed visually and upon palpation of the incisional scar, without swelling or concavity. Endocrine evaluation was not repeated. Case 2 A 12-year-old Clydesdale mare presented with stallion-likebehaviour which had started one month previously. Transrectal ultrasound examination revealed a 20 cm diameter multicystic right ovary. The left ovary was small and inactive. Hormone analysis was consistent with GCT: testosterone 959.4 range 20 (reference range 0.1 -3.8 ng/ml)1. The surgical procedure for Case 2 was similar to the case described above but was modi ed to facilitate bag placement. Speci cally, the proper ligament of the ovary was left intact during initial laparoscopic-guided dissection of the mesovarium. The flank incision was then created and the ovary manipulated into the sterile bag in the abdomen. The proper ligament was then sealed and transected under direct laparoscopic observation from L3 by passing the vessel-sealing device through the flank incision above the surgeon 's arm. The nal stages of the surgery were identical to the case described above. Surgical time was 90 min. The mare recovered well from surgery and was healthy without complications 10 weeks post operatively, with improved behaviour reported by the owner. Case 3 A 4-year-old Appaloosa mare presented with stallion-like behaviour which started 12 months previously. Transrectal ultrasound examination revealed a 12 cm diameter multicystic right ovary. The left ovary was small and inactive. Hormone analysis was consistent with a GCT: testosterone 73.1 pg/ml (reference range 20 -45 ng/ml (reference range 0.1 -3.8 ng/ml)1. Surgical ovarian removal in Case 3 was performed as in Case 2 . Surgical time was 70 min. The mare recovered well from surgery and was healthy without complications 4 weeks post operatively. Discussion Removal of GCTs has previously been described using severalmethods including colpotomy, flank incision, ventral midline or paramedian incisions and via laparoscopic techniques (Embertson 2012). Standing flank laparoscopic surgery has become a preferred procedure since it avoids generalanaesthesia, is completed using small incisions and allows for direct visualisation of the ovary during transection of the mesovarium and proper ligament (R \u20acocken et al. 2011). A limitation of ovariectomy via the flank is the increased risk of incisional complications when enlarging the incision for ovaries >12 cm (R \u20acocken et al. 2011). To avoid this in some mares after laparoscopic dissection of the mesovarium, a 2- step procedure is performed and the ovary removed via a ventral midline celiotomy (R \u20acocken et al. 2011; Vitte et al. 2014). Since this requires 2 different surgical procedures and general anaesthesia, several methods have been developed to reduce the size of the ovary within the abdominal cavity before flank removal. This includes intra-abdominal decompression and hand-assisted laparoscopic techniques (Rodgerson et al. 2002; Smith and Mair 2008; De Bont et al. 2010). These latter techniques involve the use of a strong sterile plastic bag to retrieve the ovary after it is freed from the body wall which is then dissected with scissors or a scalpel blade (Seltzer and Yarbrough 1998; Rodgerson et al. 2002; De Bont et al. 2010). A potential advantage conferred through use of a retrieval bag is the ability to remove the ovary without abdominal or incisional contamination. Division of large ovarian masses into cylindrical tissue blocks to facilitate extraction has been achieved in 7 mares using a morcellator and recently this instrument has been used for elective ovarian extraction in 30 mares in combination with a bilateral 2 portal ovariectomy technique (Kummer et al. 2010; Lund et al. 2014). Surgical times were 2 - 4.5 h for GCT removal and 47 -150 min for elective ovary removal (Kummer et al. 2010; Lund et al. 2014). Complications encountered in mares relevant to morcellation were iatrogenic organ damage and persistent haemorrhage (Lund et al. 2014). During GCT morcellation, tissue and fluid dropped into the abdomen and manual retrieval and suction were attempted (Kummer et al. 2010). Although not speci cally queried, follow-up by owner telephone interview between 6 and 40 months post GCT morcellation did not reveal evidence of tumour dissemination in the 7 mares undergoing this procedure (Kummer et al. 2010). In man, reported complications after morcellation include development of neoplasms within portals, along incisions and on visceral tissues after tumour removal (Anupama et al. 2011; Cucinella et al. 2011; Yanazume et al. 2012). This phenomenon is well documented in uterine sarcomas in man, including leiomyosarcomas and is responsible for a United States Food and Drug Administration black box warning on these devices (Anupama et al. 2011; Cucinella et al. 2011; Anon 2014). This type of dissemination has not been reported in horses and although GCTs in mares are typically benign, there is concern over use of morcellation \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd507 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015without the use of a specimen retrieval bag as tissue and fluid readily drops from the site of morcellation and complete removal of the debris is not possible (Gift et al. 1992; Patrick et al. 2003). It is unknown whether loss of tumour cells and fluid secondary to extraction by morcellation in horses could result in an increased risk of tumour dissemination. Further, it is difcult to con dently predict the malignancy of tumours without histological con rmation. Putting a mare at risk of tumour cell and fluid loss is easily prevented with the technique described in the present report. However, reduction of this potential risk does require a more invasive approach than some forms of direct morcellation. The procedure described can be implemented in hospitals that routinely perform laparoscopic surgery and although there is a learning curve in the technique, skill improves quickly as demonstrated by the decreasing surgical times over only 3 cases. Further, this technique does not appear to prolong surgical time compared with previously published studies. Since commercially available specimen retrieval bags for laparoscopic surgery are expensive and typically not large enough to be used for removal of large GCTs, an alternative was sought and found to be adequate for the procedure. However, in part due to the size of the tumours, complete laparoscopic manipulation of the bag was difcult which necessitated converting the procedure to a hand-assisted technique. Additionally, it was found that manipulation of the ovary into the specimen retrieval bag was signi cantly easier with the proper ligament of the ovary intact (Lund et al. 2014). With the proper ligament intact, the bag can be slid over the mass while it is tethered to the dorsal body wall. If all attachments are transected, the ovary is no longer stationary and moves throughout the abdomen during attempts to bag, increasing the dif culty of the manoeuvre. In Cases 2 and 3, this attachment was transected using a Ligasure before extraction of the bag edges through the flank laparotomy and activation of the morcellator. In both cases, the technique allowed direct visualisation of the GCT against the body wall and minimised the risk of iatrogenic damage to other organs (Lund et al. 2014). This case report describes a modi ed hand-assisted laparoscopic approach to remove large ovarian tumours through small flank incisions. While an 8 cm incision is adequate for hand-assisted procedures performed by surgeons of small hand and arm size, increasing the size of the incision to 10 cm to allow working space for a surgeon of larger hand and arm size will likely result in similar post operative results to those in the present report. The use of a specimen retrieval bag prevented contamination of the abdomen and incision with tumour cells and fluid during activation of the morcellator. Further, use of the morcellator to divide large GCTs does not increase surgical time and allows removal through small incisions, which could bene t mares post operatively.

A hormonal pro le performed prior to referral included increased systemic concentrations of testosterone and progesterone but a low concentration of inhibin. Transrectal ultrasound revealed ovaries consistent with a normal cycling mare. At the request of the owner, standing bilateral laparoscopic ovariectomy was performed without complication. Both ovaries were submitted for histopathological examination which revealed bilateral ovarian leiomyoma. Introduction Bilateral ovariectomy is usually performed to suppressunwanted behavioural changes, prevent chronic visceral pain during oestrus, for preparation of jump mares or for sterilisation. Unilateral ovariectomy is most often performed to remove neoplasms of which benign, unilateral granulosa cell tumours are the most common tumour type 2003; McCue et al. 2006; Muller et al. 2012) Due to hormonal alterations, mares with granulosa cell tumours may present with behaviouralchanges including persistent oestrus or stallion-like activity(McCue et al. 2006). Other ovarian neoplasms reported in mares include teratoma (Frazer et al. 1988; Catone et al. 2004), cystadenocarcinoma (Son et al. 2005), dysgerminoma (Harland et al. 2009), adenocarcinoma (Pauwels et al. 2012), B cell lymphoma (Canisso et al. 2013) and broleiomyoma (Carstanjen et al. 2009). Diagnosis of ovarian tumours is typically based on a combination of clinical signs, transrectal palpation and ultrasonography and hormone analysis (McCue et al. 2006). Due to the prevalence of granulosa cell tumours and nonspeci city of clinical signs or ultrasonographic ndings noted early in the course of disease (McCue et al. 2006), there has been substantial research related to hormonal analysis through measurement of inhibin (Christman et al. 1999; Bailey et al. 2002), testosterone (Hoque et al. 2003b) and anti-M \u20acullerian hormone (Almeida et al. 2011; Ball et al. 2013). However, other tumour types do not demonstrate the classical alterations in behaviour or hormonal abnormalities typically reported in cases of granulosa cell tumours. This case report describes bilateral ovariectomy in a mare with behavioural problems, increased testosterone and progesterone concentrations but with low inhibinconcentrations treated with laparoscopic ovariectomy. Although the appearance of the ovaries was normal ultrasonographically and grossly during laparoscopy, histological evaluation identi ed ovarian leiomyoma bilaterally. Case history and hormonal pro le An 11-year-old Warmblood mare presented to the Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for behaviouralproblems and a suspected granulosa cell tumour. The owner reported that the mare had become dangerous to ride over the past 18 months and was considered worse during times of oestrus. Synthetic progestin (Altrenogest Regu-mate) 1had been given for a 6 month period but was reported to have failed to prevent oestrus or any behavioural changes. Serum analysis was performed 5 weeks prior to presentation and measured by the Endocrinology Laboratory at the University of California Davis, using previously established reference ranges for cycling mares. Inhibin concentration was 0.01 ng/ml (reference 0.1 -0.7 ng/ml); progesterone concentration 25.9 -15 concentration 148.3 pg/ml (reference 20 -45 pg/ml). Clinical ndings On presentation the mare was in good body condition and had normal physical parameters. Transrectal ultrasonography was performed and revealed a nongravid uterus with mild to moderate oedema. The left ovary measured approximately 7 cm in diameter and had multiple hypoechoic circular to ovoid structures (1 -5 cm in diameter) consistent with follicular development. The right ovary measured approximately 7 cm in diameter and had multiple hypoechoic circular to ovoid structures (1 -2 cm in diameter) consistent with follicular development. Additionally, the right ovary also had a single 2-3 cm diameter heterogenous structure consistent with prior luteal tissue. Surgical technique An intravenous (i.v.) catheter was placed in the left jugular vein and the mare positioned in stocks. Presurgical detomidine \u00a92015 the procedure sedation was provided by a continuous infusion of detomidine draping and local anaesthetic in ltration of the portal sites using 2% lidocaine, 3 laparoscopic portals were created in both left and right flanks (Hendrickson 2006). Standing flank laparoscopic ovariectomy was performed under CO 2 insuf flation (10 -12 mmHg) using a vessel sealing device (Ligasure)2as previously described ( Fig 1a ) (Hubert et al. 2006). Once the ovarian pedicle had been separated, each ovary was removed from the ipsilateral side through 8 cm incision. The ovaries were considered to be grossly normal during laparoscopic examination ( Fig 1b ). Histological analysis Both ovaries were xed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 24 h prior to trimming and processing. After tissue xation, 4lm paraf n sections were collected onto charged slides (X- tra)3and 3 slides from each specimen stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for microscopic examination. Two sections of each ovary were immunologically stained using the Bond Polymer Re ne Red Detection system for detection of smooth muscle actin (SMA)3. Identical sections from each ovary were also stained with Masson 's trichome stain as previously described (Goldner 1938). Upon gross evaluation, the left ovary measured approximately 7 9695 cm and was focally expanded by a round, discrete and encapsulated mass that was slightly rm, pale to tan in colour, homogenous upon cut section and measured approximately 22 mm in diameter. The right ovary measured approximately 9 9796 cm and was focally expanded by a discrete encapsulated mass that was ovoid, slightly rm, pale to tan in colour, homogenous upon cut section and measured approximately 29 mm in diameter. Numerous follicular structures were present within the parenchyma of both ovarian structures which ranged in size from 5 to 20 mm in diameter and were lled with moderate amounts of clear to yellow fluid. Histologically, the normal ovarian parenchyma of both ovaries was replaced by interlacing bundles and strands of neoplastic spindle cells that intersected at various angles (Fig 2 ). These cells were moderately pleomorphic with varying amounts of brillar eosinophilic cytoplasm with indistinct cellborders. Nuclei were ovoid to elongated with blunted ends, contained one nucleoli or less and had vesicular to nely- stippled chromatin ( Fig 3 ). was also noted ( Fig 3 ). Mitoses were observed to be 7 -8 per 10 high powered elds (400x). Throughout the neoplastic cell population there were multifocal to coalescing areas of moderate necrosis as well as large cystic structures lled with abundant amounts of clear fluid. The cystic structures were lined by moderately increased numbers of uniform granulosa cells arranged in multiple layers consistent with follicular hyperplasia ( Fig 2 ). Neoplastic cells in both ovaries were completely contained within intact ovarian capsules. Immunohistochemical results revealed that neoplastic cells stained diffusely positive with smooth muscle actin ( Fig 4 ), characterised by moderately 90% of the neoplastic cells. Neoplastic cells and arterial smooth muscle (positive internal control) stained diffusely red with Masson 's trichome stain, consistent with cells of muscular origin. Scattered collagen bres stained blue throughout the neoplasm ( Fig 5 ). Follow-up At one month after surgery the incisions had healed normally. Communication with the referring veterinarian 7 months post operatively revealed that the mare 's stallion-like behaviour had resolved and no other reproductive abnormalities had been noted. Discussion The current report describes a mare undergoing standing bilateral ovariectomy due to abnormal behaviour subsequently diagnosed with bilateral ovarian leiomyomas. Blood work performed by the referring veterinarian was abnormal with signi cant increases in testosterone concentration and suggestive of the presence of a granulosa theca cell tumour. However, the lack of an increase in inhibin concentration and presence of increased concentration of progesterone were not consistent with a granulosa cell tumour. Additionally, transrectal ultrasound revealed ovarian structures to be within normal limits with multiple follicles present on both ovaries. Although oestrous-related behaviour abnormalities are considered an indication for elective bilateral ovariectomy, improvement in behavioural response is not always consistent * xa) b) Fig 1: Laparoscopic view of both ovaries in an 11-year-old mare. a) laparoscopic view of left ovary from left flank.

In this case, the high concentration of testosterone was the suspected source of the abnormal and aggressive behaviour in this mare. However, as testosterone can also be produced from the adrenal gland, it was discussed with the owner that ovariectomy may not result in any signi cant change in hormonal concentrations or any learned behaviour (Hedberg et al. 2007). In this case, both ovaries were submitted for histopathological evaluation in the hope of determining the cause of the high testosterone concentrations. Unexpectedly, a diagnosis of bilateral ovarian leiomyoma was found.Although no de nitive explanation for increased testosterone concentrations was established, several possibilities exist. Increased concentrations of testosterone may have resulted from the follicular hyperplasia present in the ovaries of thismare. Abnormal follicles in the ovaries of granulosa cell tumours of mares have been reported to lack the ability to produce aromatase which plays an important role in the conversion of testosterone into oestradiol (Hoque et al. 2003b) resulting in persistently high levels of testosterone. Another possibility is the neoplastic leiomyoma tissue originated from metaplasia of thecal cells (Santini et al. 1995; Lerwill et al. 2004) known for their production of testosterone. There are case reports involving women with ovarian leiomyomas that demonstrated virilisation, hirsutism and high testosterone concentrations (Parish et al. 1984; Mallya et al. 1990). Testosterone concentrations in these cases signi cantly decreased post surgical removal of an ovarian mass. Although testosterone concentrations were not followed up in this mare, her reported stallion-like behaviour had resolved post operatively; therefore, return to normal levels oftestosterone was expected to have occurred. Leiomyomas of the urogenital tract have been previously reported in the veterinary literature (Broome et al. 1992; Kunar et al. 1995; Berezowski 2002; Miller et al. 2003; Walzer et al.

Leiomyomas originate from smooth muscle and suspected sources include the blood vessel walls of the cortical stroma of the hilus, the corpus luteum or from the ovarian ligament (Kawano et al. 2006). These tumours could also result from metaplasia of smooth muscle ovarian stroma or metaplasia of ovarian theca externa cells (Lerwill et al. 2004). It was not possible to determine the speci c origin of the mass in the current study due to its expansive nature. Overall prognosis for the mare was good as both tumours were well encapsulated and complete excision was determined on histological evaluation. This case report highlights the importance of histological analysis of both ovaries when bilateral ovariectomy is performed and the mare presents with abnormal behaviour and/or hormonal pro le. This is especially relevant when the presentation is not consistent with a granulosa cell tumour. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION For Intra-Articular (I.A.) Use in Horses. CONTRAINDICATIONS: BetaVet\u00ae is contraindicated with hypersensitivity to betamethasone. Intra-articular injection of corticosteroids for local effect is contraindicated in the presence of septic arthritis. WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. Clinical and experimental data have demonstrated that corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally to animals may induce the first stage of parturition when administered during the last trimester of pregnancy and may precipitate premature par turition followed by dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and metritis. Additionally, corticosteroids administered to dogs, rabbits and rodents during pregnancy have resulted in cleft palate in offspring and in other congenital anomalies including deformed forelegs, phocomelia and anasarc a. Therefore, before use of corticosteroids in pregnant animals, the possible benefits to the pregnant animal should be weighed against potential hazards to its developing embryo or fetus. Human Warnings: Not for use in humans. For use in animals only. Keep this and all medications out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in the case of accidental human exposure. PRECAUTIONS: Corticosteroids, including BetaVet \u00ae, administered intra-articularly are systemically absorbed. Do not use in horses with acute infections. Acute moderate to severe exacerbation of pain, further loss of joint motion, fever, or malaise within several days following intra-articular injection may indicate a septic process. Because of the anti-inflammator y action of corticosteroids, signs of infection in the treated joint may be masked. Due to the potential for exacerbation of clinical signs of laminitis, glucocorticoids should be used with caution in horses with a history of laminitis, or horses otherwise at a higher risk for laminitis. Use with caution in horses with chronic nephritis, equine pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID), and congestive heart failure. Concurrent use of other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs or other corticosteroids, should be approached with caution. Due to the potential for systemic exposure, concomitant use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids may increase the risk of gastrointestinal, renal, and other toxicity. Consider appropriate wash out times prior to administering additional NSAIDs or corticosteroids. ADVERSE REACTIONS: Adverse reactions reported during a field study of 239 horses of various breeds which had been administered either BetaVet \u00ae (n=119) or a saline control (n=120) at five percent (5%) and above were: acute joint effusion and/or local injection site swelling (within 2 days of injection), 15% BetaVet \u00ae and 13% saline saline control. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Shake well immediately before use. Use immediately after opening, then discard any remaining contents. RX ONLY References: 1. Houdeshell, JW.

From the manufacturer of Adequan\u00ae (polysulfated glycosaminoglycan)increased lameness (within swelling of treated joint (5 or more days after injection), 2.5% potent glucocorticoid steroid with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Depending upon their physico-chemical properties, drugs administered intra-articularly may enter the general circulation because the synovial joint cavity is in direct equilibrium with the surrounding blood supply. After the intra-articular administration of 9 mg BetaVet \u00ae in horses, there were quantifiable concentrations of betamethasone (above 1.0 ng/mL) in the plasma. EFFECTIVENESS: A negative control, randomized, masked field study provided data to evaluate the effectiveness of BetaVet \u00ae administered at 1.5 mL (9 mg betamethasone) once intra-articularly for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in horses. Clinical success was defined as improvement in one lameness grade according to the AAEP lameness scoring system on Day 5 following treatment. The success rate for horses in the BetaVet \u00ae group was statistically significantly different (p=0.0061) than that in the saline group, with success rates of 75.73% and 52.52%, respectively (back-transformed from the logistic regression). ANIMAL SAFETY: A 3-week target animal safety (TAS) study was conducted to evaluate the safety of BetaVet \u00ae in mature, healthy horses. Treatment groups included a control (isotonic saline at a volume equivalent to the pound bodyweight; BetaVet\u00ae). Treatments were administered by intra-articular injection into the left middle carpal joint once every 5-days for 3 treatments. Injection site reactions were the most common observations in all treatment groups. Injection site reactions were observed within 1 hour of dosing and included swelling at the injection site, lameness/stiffness of the left front limb, and flexing the left front knee at rest. The injection site reactions ranged from slight swelling (in many horses on multiple days in all treatment groups) to excessive fluid with swelling, pain, and lameness (4x group only). Injection site reactions were observed most commonly on treatment days, and generally decreased in number and severity over subsequent days. The incidence of injection site reactions increased after the second and third injection (number of abnormalities noted on day 10 > day 5 > day 0). In the BetaVet \u00ae treated groups the number and severity of the injection site reactions were dose dependent. The 4X BetaVet\u00ae group had the highest overall incidence of and severity of injection site reactions, which included heat, swelling, pain, bleeding, and holding the limb up at rest. The control group and 4X group (which received similar injection volumes) had a similar incidence of injection site reactions; however, the severity of reactions was greater in the 4X group. Absolute neutrophils were statistically significantly higher in the BetaVet \u00ae treated groups as compared to the control group. Trends toward a decrease in lymphocytes and eosinophils, and an increase in monocytes were identified in the BetaVet \u00ae treated groups after the initial dose of BetaVet\u00ae. Individual animal values for white blood cells generally remained within the reference range. BetaVet \u00ae treated horses also had a trend toward increased blood glucose after the initial dose. Some individual animals showed mild increases in blood glucose above the reference range.

Beacom Department of Clinical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, USA. *Corresponding are the most common ovarian neoplasms in the horse and are an important differential diagnosis for mares that develop unusual behaviours such as prolonged anoestrus, continuous or intermittent oestrus (nymphomania behaviour) or aggressive stallion-like behaviour (McCue et al. 2006). The alteration in behaviour of mares with GCTs is due to active steroid hormone secretion from tumour cells and which of these behaviours is expressed is dependent on the type of tumour cell present. In a review of 78 mares with GCTs, 20 out of 63 mares in which behaviour was recorded showed anoestrus behaviour (31.7%), 14 (22.2%) demonstrated continuous oestrus and 29 (46.0%) exhibited stallion-like behaviour (Meagher et al. 1977). Stallion-like or aggressive behaviour is manifested in mares with blood testosterone concentrations over 100 pg/ml (Stabenfeldt et al. 1979), typically seen with tumours that have a large theca cellcomponent. In the current issue, Daniel et al. (2015a,b) describe 4 cases of ovarian neoplastic disease. All 4 mares presented initially for evaluation of dangerous and/or aggressive behaviour and all 4 had elevated blood testosterone concentrations (in 3 of the 4 greater than 100 pg/ml). Interestingly, only 3 of these mares had an abnormal ovary on reproductive examination and unilateral ovariectomy with subsequent histopathology con rmed a diagnosis of GCT in these 3 mares (Daniel et al. 2015a). In the fourth mare, both ovaries were considered to be withinnormal limits; however, due to the elevated serumtestosterone concentration, bilateral ovariectomy waspursued. Subsequently, a histopathological diagnosis ofovarian leiomyoma was made (Daniel et al. 2015b). Abnormal behaviour in horses is seen subsequent to pain or underlying disease, such as the case with GCTs or as a consequence of management ( Table 1 ) and can be expressed during rest, during handling for certain purposes and/or during exercise. Changes in management subsequent to domestication of the horse are likely to underlie some of the abnormal behaviours seen in horses that used to be described as vices and are now categorised as redirected behaviours, learned behaviours, physical problems, stereotypies or the consequence inappropriate stimulation (Henderson 2007; Hothersall and Nicol 2009; McGreevy 2012). A wide range of unwanted behaviours are recognised in horses and include cribbing, weaving, stall walking, self mutilation and development of aggression or dangerous behaviour such as biting and kicking towards people/stall doors during feeding or in the pasture, biting and kicking towards other horses and rearing and bucking while under saddle. Underlying causes may be attributable to pain or physical inability on the horse side;however, these behaviours can also be a result of poor management strategies including poor riding technique,poor application of learning theory (training) or having unrealistic expectations for the horse (McGreevy et al. 2011; McGreevy 2012; Hockenhull and Creighton 2013). When faced with a horse with presenting complaints of alterations in behaviour including development of aggression and/or dangerous behaviours, it is important that medical conditions such as those listed in Table 1 are ruled out. The evaluation of behaviour problems begins by gathering detailed information on the background and management details of the horse in question and the unwanted behaviour it displays (McGreevy 2012; Fig 1 ). Many behaviours considered abnormal are actually normal but unwanted. It is important a distinction is made between normal learned behaviours and abnormal behaviour due to a disease process. In addition to the management factors presented in Table 1 and extensively reviewed and discussed by McGreevy (2012), physiological conditions such aspregnancy and having a foal at foot can lead to behavioural changes. A comprehensive physical examination should take place with careful assessment of all body systems. This examination should provide information to determine whether or not there is clear evidence for neurological ophthalmological and/or musculoskeletal disease ( Fig 1 ). In addition, a thorough physical examination should identify abnormalities such as bilateral limb swelling and oedema,changes suggestive of hypertrophic osteopathy, described to occur in horses with GCTs (Lavoie et al. 1992) and ovarian dysgerminoma (McLennan and Kelly 1977; Meuten and Rendano 1978). If there are no abnormalities detected during physical examination, an examination per rectum should be performed during which the caudal abdomen is assessed and in particular the reproductive tract evaluated. A complete blood count and serum biochemistries will provide information on the presence or absence of an inflammatory condition and/or organ dysfunction. Additional ancillary diagnostics may be necessary to either con rm a suspected diagnosis (e.g. blood hormone pro les to con rm GCT) or to evaluate a speci c body system in more depth (cerebrospinal fluid analysis, imaging techniques). Depending on the examination ndings, it may become necessary to, in the course of problem evaluation, revisit body systems. For example lameness and other types of musculoskeletal discomfort that lead to acute or chronic pain are important causes for temperament changes, aggression or irritability in horses (Fureix et al. 2010) but may not be easy to identify on initial examination and may require extensive orthopaedic and imaging examinations to identify and localise. Similarly, the presence of intra- abdominal disease may not be immediately obvious andmay necessitate peritoneal fluid analysis and/or other techniques for nal diagnosis. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd515 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015Bilateral ovarian enlargement is normally seen in pregnant mares from Days 40 to 150 of gestation with formation ofsecondary corpora lutea (McCue 1998). However, bilateralovarian enlargement can also be seen in mares with ovariandisease. Unilateral ovarian enlargement is seen in mares withanovulatory follicles or due to haematomas following ovulationbut is also a common nding in mares with GCTs and can be seen secondary to other neoplastic conditions. Other ovarian neoplastic diseases reported are lymphosarcoma (Lock andMacy 1979), cystadenoma (Bridges et al. 1994), dysgerminoma (Chandra et al. 1998; Gehlen et al. 2006; Harland et al. 2009), teratoma (Catone et al. 2004), cystadenocarcinoma (Son et al. 2005), broleiomyoma in a pregnant mare (Carstanjen et al. 2009), adenocarcinoma (Pauwels et al. 2012), multicentric B cell lymphoma involving the uterus and ovary (Canisso et al. 2013), brothecoma (Azizi et al. 2014) and leiomyoma (Daniel et al. 2015b). Most commonly, GCTs will produce a unilaterally enlarged ovary with an inactive contralateral ovary but there are reports of GCTs in cycling mares with a functional contralateral ovary (McCue et al. 1991). Additionally, one of the cases described by Daniel et al. (2015b) had normal ovaries but hormone proles suggestive of a sex cord stromal tumour and in this mare a diagnosis of ovarian leiomyoma was made by histopathology. Approximately 40 -60% of mares with GCTs have elevated blood testosterone concentrations likely secondary to the tumours having a signi cant theca component McCue et al. 2006; Crabtree 2011; Ball et al. 2013). However, there is considerable individual variation in testosterone concentrations in mares and a single testosterone measurement in mares with GCTs may not accurately estimate the rate of testosterone secretion (Bailey et al. 2002). Furthermore, increased blood testosterone concentrations are normal during gestation with peaks recorded at Day 80 from production by the corpora lutea (~120 pg/ml) and at Day 200 from gonads (~200 pg/ml; Silberzahn et al. 1984; Daels et al. 1996). In addition, the adrenal cortex is a source for androstenedione and testosterone production and can contribute to blood androgen concentrations (Silberzahn et al. 1984; Hedberg et al. 2007) and this was a concern in the case described by Daniel et al. (2015b) that had normal ovaries on reproductive examination. In mares with GCTs, progesterone concentrations are typically low, consistent with the absence of luteal tissue; however, some mares with GCTs remain cyclical and thus may have elevated blood progesterone concentrations (Hinrichs et al. 1990; McCue et al. 1991). The mare reported by Daniel et al. (2015b) and diagnosed with ovarian leiomyoma had a progesterone concentration consistent with the presence of luteal tissue. Inhibin is a glycoprotein hormone produced by granulosa cells of the ovary and plays an active role in the regulation of follicular development and in limiting the number of ovulations in horses through the negative feedback effect on FSH. Two of the 3 mares reported by Daniel et al. (2015a) had elevated inhibin concentrations; the third was at the upper limit of normal. Two large studies showed that inhibin concentrations are elevated in 80 -89% of mares with GCTs (McCue 1992; Ball et al. 2013). More recently, serum anti-M \u20acullerian hormone concentrations have been investigated for the diagnosis of GCTs in mares (Ball et al. 2013). Anti-M \u20acullerian hormone is normally produced by granulosa cells of small growing and antral follicles and is expressed in normal equine ovaries as well as in GCTs. Ball et al. (2013) showed that the sensitivity of anti-M \u20acullerian hormone for detection of known GCTs was 98% for GCTs veri ed by histopathology, 80% for inhibin, 48% for testosterone and 84% for the combination of inhibin and testosterone. Understanding causality of development of abnormal behaviour is important to determine a pathway for resolution of the unwanted behaviour. Ovariectomy is the preferredTABLE 1: Potential sources for development of aggressive unwanted behaviours in the horse Disease factorsNeurological Developmental (hydrocephalus) Infectious disease (viral, bacterial, disease) Musculoskeletal Acute and chronic pain (arthritis, desmitis, muscle pain, degenerative joint disease, spinal column/facet/spinous process/sacral ileac) Reproductive Dioestrus (aversion towards stallion) Pregnancy (testosterone production by fetal gonads) Exogenous steroid administration Management factorsFeeding Stable vs. pasture Social Hierarchy developmentKinetic Space limitations in stabled horses for laying down,rolling and browsing Poor training Punishment and inappropriate negative reinforcement canlead to perpetuation ofunwanted behaviours Poor riding Lack of balance allows the horse to practiceunrequested responses(trial and error) Abnormal behaviours resulting from disease factors are categorised by body systems that may be involved.

This removes the source of abnormal hormone secretion (Stabenfeldt et al. 1979; McCue 1992; Bailey et al. 2002; Ball et al. 2013), eliminates behavioural changes and allows the remaining ovary, in unilateralconditions, to return to normal cyclic activity. The 3 maresdescribed by Daniel et al. (2015a) that presented for abnormal behaviour related to GCTs all showed resolution of behavioural problems following ovariectomy. Also, the mare diagnosed with a leimyoma with elevated blood testosterone concentrations regained normal behaviour following ovariectomy (Daniel et al. 2015b). Development of abnormal behaviour as a result of management factors such as being kept in stables, frequent, high intensity exercise, transport and mixing of horses, has clearly been shown to compromise the health and welfare of elite horses. These adverse consequences to the horse 's health, performance and welfare through poor management and/or riding are manytimes preventable or modi able and improved husbandry practices, horse handling and training practices shouldcontribute to the elimination of these unwanted behaviours.

This report describes the occurrenceof pancytopenia in 2 horses, one subsequent to an immunemediated reaction and the other bone marrow aplasiafollowing the administration of trimethoprim and sulfadimidine.These cases highlight the importance of judicious use ofantimicrobial agents and describe adverse drug reactions inhorses receiving potentiated sulfonamide antimicrobials. Introduction The antimicrobial drug combination of a sulfonamide and adiaminopyrimidine, is used commonly in equine practice (Stackand antimicrobial coverage and are used to treatinfectious processes in the respiratory tract, urogenital tract,alimentary tract, skin and synovial structures (Reed et al . 2004). An adverse drug reaction is a harmful unintended consequence that occurs when medications and medicinalproducts are used at routine doses for the treatment,prevention or diagnosis of a clinical condition (Cribb 1996;Edwards 2000). The potentiated sulfonamides can havepotentially life threatening side effects; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxoazole and sulfadiazine-pyrimethaminecombinations have been associated with the development ofimmune mediated disease and aplastic anaemia in dogs(Trepanier 2004), al 1998; Piercy and Schott 2011). This report describes 2 casesof pancytopenia mediated by different mechanisms followingadministration of a commonly used potentiated sulfonamide. Case details Case 1 History A 3-year-old female Quarter Horse was referred to theGoulburn Valley Equine Hospital for investigation of fever ofunknown origin. The filly had been treated for a respiratorytract infection following competition and transportationfor 3 weeks with trimethoprim-sulfadimidine (TMS) powder (Trimdine Powder 1; 30 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h) with no improvement in clinical signs. Clinical examination On presentation the filly was quiet, alert and responsive withmoderate generalised sweating. The filly was febrile (39.4\u00b0C),tachycardic were of 2-3 s. No petechiae or ecchymotichaemorrhages were evident on the visible oral, or vulvar mucousmembranes or sclera. Based on the mare's history of respiratorydisease and recurrence of fever, endoscopy of the upperrespiratory tract, and thoracic and abdominal ultrasonographywere performed. Endoscopic examination of the upperrespiratory tract revealed mild petechial haemorrhages withinthe walls of the and pathology Haematology and serum biochemistry results revealed a mildanaemia and normal total protein concentration ( Table 1 ). A moderate leucopenia characterised Erythrocytre and leucocyte significant abnormalities total bilirubin127 mmol/l (reference range [rr] 4-100 mmol/l). Initial treatment Differential diagnoses considered for pancytopenia included severe systemic infection/inflammation, bone marrowsuppression and/or immune mediated destruction ofprogenitor cells. hyperbilirubinaemia, withouthaemoglobulinuria and haemoglobinaemia is consistent withextravascular haemolysis. Based on the initial clinical assessmentand diagnostic procedures performed, a severe systemicAbbreviations IMHA: Immune / OCTOBER 2015inflammatory response to an infectious or noninfectious disease seemed less likely. Oral administration of TMS powder wasdiscontinued and initial treatment for a suspected immunemediated disease commenced. Therapy comprised ofdexamethasone (Dexapent 2; mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 12 h). Additional diagnostics On Day 2 of hospitalisation serological testing for the presenceof anti-erythrocyte equineinfectious anaemia agar immunodiffusion test (Cogginstest) were performed. A marrow biopsy and aspiratewere collected from the tuber coxae of the ileum for histopathological examination. The direct Coombs test was strongly positive and the Coggins test negative. The bone marrow biopsy revealeda normocellular environment, although the overallhaematopoietic cellularity was low. Immature and maturemegakaryocytes were present, although they weresubjectively reduced in number. Immature and mature myeloidcells were also present, although a slight reduction in erythoidcells was evident. A presumptive diagnosis of an immunemediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) and immune mediatedthrombocytopenia (IMT) was made. The cause of the markedleucopenia and neutropaenia is unknown, although thesefindings may also have been associated with immunemediated destruction and/or bone marrow suppression/aplasia. Clinical progression On Day 2 of hospitalisation, the mare developed petechialhaemorrhage of the oral mucous membranes, and the vulvalmucous membranes were pale and jaundiced. The mareremained alert and responsive, and clinical parameters (heartrate, respiratory rate and body temperature) were stable.Azathioprine (Imuran 4; 3 mg/kg bwt per os q. 24 h) therapy was commenced on day 4 of hospitalisation, following the resultsof the direct Coombs test and bone marrow histopathology.The mare continued to improve clinically, with resolution oforal mucous membrane pallor and petechiae on Day 6 ofhospitalisation. Stabilisation followed by a gradual increase in packed cell volume was suggestive of disease resolution(Table 2 ). On Day 6 of hospitalisation, the dexamethasone dose was slowly reduced by 10 mg/day. Azathioprine andoxytetracycline treatment was discontinued on Day 7 ofhospitalisation and the mare was discharged with instructionsto continue the decreasing doses of dexamethasone. Onfollow-up examination 9 days after presentation the marewas clinically normal. A complete blood count revealeda mild leucocytosis and neutrophilia, probably due to theeffects of systemic corticosteroids ( Table 1 ), although hyperbilirubinaemia had resolved. All haematological valueswere within normal limits 16 days after presentation. The horsereturned to normal athletic performance and was competingto a high level in reining competition 3 months after resolution ofclinical illness. Case 2 History A 16-year-old Australian Stock Horse mare was presented toGoulburn Valley Equine Hospital for investigation of bilateralepistaxis and lethargy. At the time of admission, the mare hadreceived TMS (30 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h) that had been prescribed by the referring veterinarian for treatment of astaphylococcal dermatitis for 7 weeks. Clinical examination On presentation the mare was alert and responsive but quiet.The mare was afebrile with a normal respiratory rate beats/min). Mucous membranes were membranes but not the sclera. A smallamount of blood was present at the external nares bilaterally.Endoscopic examination of the upper respiratory tractrevealed moderate petechial haemorrhage on the walls androof of the nasopharynx. No blood was present in the tracheaand endoscopic examination of both guttural pouchesrevealed no abnormalities. Clinical pathology Haematology revealed a moderate anaemia (see Table 1 ). There was a moderate leucopenia characterised by aTABLE 1: Haematology results of Case 1 at Days 1 and 9 and Case 2 at Days 1 and 6 Clinical pathology resultsCase 1 Case 2 Reference ranges Day 1 Day 9 Day 16 Day 1 Day 6 Red blood cells ( \u00a51012/l) 5.57 6.5 7.12 4.51 3.35 6.50-9.50 Haemoglobin concentration (g/l) 88 104 120 76 57 110-190Packed cell volume (l/l) 0.24 0.29 0.33 0.21 0.16 0.32-0.52Total protein (g/l) 60 58-76White blood cells ( \u00a510 9/l) 2.5 13.2 7.9 2.5 1.3 6.0-12.0 Neutrophil ( \u00a5109/l) 1.4 (bands 0) 12.3 5.5 1.4 (bands 0) 0.2 5.5-12.5 Lymphocyte ( \u00a5109/l) 1.0 0.5 2.2 1.0 \u00a5109/l) 7 434 244 7 <5 100-500 TABLE 2: Serial packed cell volume measurements of Case 1 Case 1 Day 1 Day 3 Day 5 Day 7 Day 9 Reference range Packed cell volume (l/l) 0.24 0.25 0.27 0.28 0.29 0.32-0.52 Total protein \u00a9201 EVJ VETERINARY neutropenia and mild lymphopenia. A marked thrombocytopenia was present. All serum biochemistry valueswere within normal limits. Differential diagnoses considered atthis time included immune mediated haemolytic anaemia andthrombocytopenia, bone marrow suppression and aplasia. Initial treatment Oral administration of TMS powder was discontinued. Thehorse was treated initially with dexamethasone (Dexapent 2; bwt i.v. q. 24 h). Additional Serological testing for equine infectious anaemia and a directCoombs test were negative. On Day 3 of hospitalisation, asternal bone marrow aspirate was performed. There wasmarked hypocellularity of the bone marrow with low numbers ofboth erythroid and myeloid cells and an absence ofmyeloblasts, promyelocytes and megakaryocytes. A completeultrasonographic examination of the thorax and abdomen wasperformed with no abnormalities detected. This was repeateddaily to evaluate for the development of internalhaemorrhage. Clinical progression The mare became increasingly lethargic and tachycardic,and petechiation of the oral mucous membranes with haemorrhage and moderateepistaxis was evident. A CBC repeated on Day 6 ofhospitalisation revealed a deterioration of all parameters, witha marked anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and amoderate lymphopenia. A coagulation profile revealed amarkedly prolonged activated clotting time of 220 s (rr120-160 s), an activated partial thromboplastin time of 76 s (rr30-45 s) and a prothrombin time of 14.4 s (rr 8-11 s). At thisstage severe systemic inflammatory response syndromeand/or disseminated intravascular coagulation, and folic aciddeficiency were considered to be associated with themare's clinical deterioration. A whole blood transfusion wasindicated although difficulties in finding a compatible donormeant the therapy was delayed. Oral supplementation of folic acid (Folic Acid 6;1 0m g per osq. 12 h) was commenced and the mare receive d5lo f whole blood intravenously from a Standardbred mare of Qaand Aa negative blood type. Dexamethasone therapy wasalso discontinued. The day following the transfusion the mare appeared brighter, mucous membranes appeared pink, petechiae wereless numerous, epistaxis and haemorrhage from the vulvaceasing. The mare continued to improve until Day 14 of hospitalisation when a sudden deterioration occurred withthe development of diffuse petechial and ecchymotichaemorrhage of all mucous and profuse epistaxis.No further haematology and biochemistry was performedand, in view of the guarded prognosis for survival, the marewas subjected to euthanasia. Post mortem examination The serosal surfaces of the thorax and abdomen were covered in ecchymotic and petechial haemorrhages. Theliver appeared mildly enlarged with slight rounding of the lobes and the spleen appeared congested. Histological changesincluded pronounced hypocellularity of the bone marrow,mild enlargement of the hepatocytes and congestion of thehepatic sinusoids with red blood cells. There was markeddiffuse lymphoid depletion within the spleen with an absenceof lymphocytes around the periarteriolar sheaths. Discussion The cases described in this report demonstrate evidence ofprobable adverse drug reactions to potentiated sulfonamideantimicrobials in horses. The primary clinical syndrome evidentin both cases was pancytopenia, a reduction in the erythrocytes, leucocytes (Lavoie et al . 1987; Angel et al . 1991) and it may be associated with severe viral and/or bacterial infection,leucaemic and immune mediated disease, and/or toxinexposure (Reed et al . 2004). Bone marrow suppression may occur due to aplastic disorders and myelophthistic diseases, including myelofibrosisand metastatic neoplasia and lymphoidleukaemia). Acquired bone marrow aplasia can occursecondarily to bacterial and viral infections, chronic renal andhepatic disease, and drug therapies (Dunavant and Murray1975; Lavoie et al . 1987). InCase 1 , a positive direct Coomb's test indicated that anaemia was attributable to an immune mediated disease.The direct Coomb's test detects the presence of IgGantibodies or complement on the surface of red blood cells,and is a highly specific but not particularly sensitive test forerythrocyte agglutination and immune mediated disease(Thomas and Livesey 1998). andthromocytopenia are recognised to occur Evan's syndrome (Lubas 1997). Therefore it is plausiblethe thrombocytopenia present in Case 1 was also attributable to an immune mediated interaction. The immaturenormocellular environment of the sampled bone marrow issuggestive of reactive bone marrow, consistent with adiagnosis of IMHA and IMT. In the horse, IMHA has been associated with the administration of penicillin and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole(Step et al . 1991; Thomas and Livesey 1998). IMHA is a secondary type II hypersensitivity reaction whereby antibodies are directed against antigens on the redblood cell surface. Drugs can act as haptens, a molecule thatbecomes immunogenic when bound to an appropriatecarrier protein. This complex is then presented to a CD-4 (Thelper) lymphocyte inducing cytokine production andenhanced anti-erythrocyte antibody responses. result in the signalling of the erythrocytes to bedestroyed or phagocytosed by the spleen (Peterson et al . 1984). This type of hypersensitivity reaction can also beinduced by neoplastic diseases and/or viral infections. Similarimmune mediated destruction is thought also to occur in IMT,whereby platelets signalled to be destroyed are boundin antibody-immune complexes elicited by a particular drug.Establishing a definitive diagnosis of immune mediatedthrombocyte destruction involves the use offlow cytometricantibody detection (McGurrin 2004), and unfortunately thisdiagnostic test was not readily available. InCase 2 , there was minimal evidence to support an immune mediated aetiology, and it is more likely the severe \u00a9201 EVJ Ltd521 2EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE marrow suppression/aplasia resulted from prolonged potentiated sulfonamide therapy and an induced folic aciddeficiency. The mode of action of trimethoprim sulfonamide antimicrobials well understood. The sulfonamides actas para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA),preventing the production of dihydrofolic acid. Dihydrofolicacid is a precursor for tetrahydrofolate, an essentialcomponent of folic acid formation and bacterial replication.Trimethoprim inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase,responsible for the conversion of acid totetrahydrofolic acid preventing folic acid formation. Folic acidis required for mammalian and bacterial cellular nucleic acidsynthesis, with haematopoietic cells being particularly sensitiveto deficiency due to their rapid cell division. Mammaliancells do not require the action of PABA for folic acid synthesis,but rather folate is absorbed directly through thegastrointestinal tract or following gut microbial production. Inhorses treated with potential sulfonamide antimicrobials, thelack of gut microbial folic acid production and reducedsynthesis following absorption due to failure of dihydrofolatereductase result in folic acid deficiency. Dietarysupplementation is not sufficient to prevent the clinicalsyndromes associated with folate deficiency (Toribio et al . 1998), as dihydrofolate reductase is required for oralabsorption of folate (Zimmerman et al . 1987) and therefore it is not surprising that the mare in Case 2 did not respond favourably to oral folate supplementation. Bone potentiated sulfonamide therapy (Toribioet al . 1998) and this may explain the leucopenia evident in Case 1 . Serum folic acid concentrations were not measured in this case and therefore deficiency cannot be confirmed. Animmune mediated destruction of leucocytes in the circulationshould also be considered and has been identified in dogsfollowing potential sulfonamide therapy (Trepanier 2004). Drug-induced IMHA and IMT treatment protocols in man, dogs, cats and horses (Blue et al . 1987; Step et al . 1991; McConnico et al . 1992; Thomas and Livesey 1998) are aimed at removing the inciting cause of the immune mediatedreaction, dampening of the immune system usingimmunosuppressive drugs, and providing supportive care inorder to prevent secondary complications. Corticosteroids arethought to reduce the reticuloendothelial cell clearance ofred blood cells and platelets coated with IgG, andcomplement and reduce the production of and increase thecatabolism of immunoglobulins (Morris 1987; Jain 1988).Azathioprine has been used in the successful treatment of IMTin horses refractory to corticosteroid therapy (Humber et al . 1991; McGurrin 2004). The inhibits bone marrowpromyelocyte proliferation, number ofcirculating monocytes available to become macrophages inblood (Humber et al . 1991). Rapid clinical response has been seen in horses treated with azathioprine (Humber et al . 1991; McGurrin 2004); however, the mechanism of this rapidresponse in the horse is not understood, as, typically in humanmedicine, a positive effect is not apparent for weeks or monthsfollowing the initiation of therapy (Berchtold 1989).Cyclophosphamide is a chemotherapeutic drug that hasbeen used in combination with azathioprine to treat a case ofcorticosteroid refractory IMHA in a horse (Messer and Arnold1991). It is possible that in Case 1 the rapid clinicalimprovement seen was associated with the withdrawal of the inciting cause, rather than a direct effect of medicationadministered. The initial use of corticosteroids in the treatmentof Case 2 was not warranted. The medication was administered based on an initial suspicion of immunemediated disease aetiology. The use of antimicrobials inthe treatment of both cases is debatable. These drugswere administered prophalactically due to the severity ofleucopenia and neutropenia. The risk of an immune mediateddrug reaction following ceftiofur, gentamicin and tetracyclineadministration was considered low. The treatment of choice in horses with severe thrombocytopenia is a transfusion of platelet enriched plasma(Robinson and Sprayberry 2009), although the unavailability ofthis product limits its use. In human patients, platelet enrichedplasma transfusions are limited to actual bleeding episodes, asdid occur in Case 2 , or cerebral haemorrhage. A whole blood transfusion will provide the patient with viable plateletsand clotting factors (Factors V and VIII) if the sample isadministered immediately following collection or storedcorrectly at 20-24\u00b0C for <24 h. The treatment of choice in human patients with severe aplastic anaemia is bone marrowtransplantation (Young 2006), a technique that has beenutilised in foals with combined immunodeficiency diseasealthough has not been investigated in mature horses withbone marrow aplasia (Bue 1986). Adverse drug reactions are potentially fatal complications associated with the administration of all drugs, includingantimicrobials in equine veterinary practice and thereforeprescription of antimicrobials should be performed judiciously.Awareness of potential drug reactions as described in thepresented cases may enable prompt recognition, earlycessation of treatment and instigation of potentially lifesavingtherapies in the future.

Davis and D. Boothe* Department of Anatomy, Physiology and Pharmacology, Auburn University, Alabama, USA. *Corresponding author email: boothdm@auburn.edu Reactions to sulfonamide antimicrobials re flect the greatest proportion of antimicrobial adversities in the dog and are common in man but less frequently reported in other species. A distinction in the underlying cause of adversity should be made between sulfonamide antimicrobials and other sulfa or sulfonamide drugs. Adversity zonisamide or furosemide probably re flect the basic structure of the sulfanilamide molecule which is an arylamine (an amine group is directly attached to a benzene ring). This arylamine generally is eliminated by Phase II N-acetylation, an enzyme in which dogs are de cient (Funk-Keenan et al. 2012). As such, dogs more than other species may be more susceptible to adverse events, if, in the face of de ciency, the arylamine molecule is shunted back to Phase I drug metabolism. Phase I metabolism of arylamines is an oxidative pathway that produces hydroxylamine, a known cytotoxin. However, it canbe further metabolised to a nitroso compound which, although cytotoxic, is more immunogenic than the hydroxyarylamine. Immunogenicity indicates an allergic or 'hypersensitivity ' response may occur, suggesting a type B adverse drug reaction. Such reactions, are unrelated to dose or duration of exposure (the limitation being the time needed to produce antibodies) and as such are largely unpredictable. The horses reported here by Cudmore et al. (2015) experienced an allergic or 'hypersensitivity 'response as previously described in dogs (Trepanier et al. 2003), is supported by the multiple cell types, including thrombocytes, targeted in the bone marrow. What is less clear is why the bone marrow is often a target of presumed haptenisation by sulfonamides or other drug allergens. Reports of adversity to sulfonamides in horses is limited. One report by Stack and Schott (2011) describes adversities that were primarily neurological in manifestation. The onset of clinical signs in 3 of the 4 horses was 2 days or less, suggesting a different (non-allergic) mechanism of adversity. It is important to remember that other mechanisms of adversity to sulfonamides may occur including predictable type A adverse events (dose and duration dependent). These type of reactions do occur with other 'sulfa 'drugs. Further, in this report, the 'potentiator '(trimethoprim) may also be responsible for the adverse reactions, as has been reported in man. Another type A adverse event reported for sulfonamides is folic acid de ciency. Its role in this report should not be ignored despite the fact that it is dif cult to document. Aplastic anaemia presumably due to impairedfolic acid synthesis has been reported in dogs receivinghigh doses of sulfadiazine although the role of allergy vs.folic acid de ciency has not been documented. Because mammalian cells can use dietary folic acid,supplementation is appropriate, particularly if anaemia is normocytic rather than megaloblastic. The capacity for acetylation in horses is not known and, as such, assessing the role of metabolism in the adversities reported here is dif cult. In human medicine, the underlying predisposition of adverse drug reactions to various drugs has been evaluated using genetic sequencing (Zhou et al. 2015). By analysing target sequences for additions, deletions or differences between the affected and normal populations, researchers are hoping to identify genes which can be screened for to avoid potential allergic reactions in high risk populations. This approach has been undertaken regarding a predisposition to sulfonamide hypersensitivity in man and dogs (Funk-Keenan et al. 2012; Sacco et al. 2012). Using this approach as a template, if these reactions take place within speci c horse breeds, as has been documented in Thoroughbreds and Clydesdales, performing similar searches within the equine genome may be warranted for a more prudent understanding of the pharmacogenomic basis of these adversities.

Leise* Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, USA; andEquine Reproduction Laboratory, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, evaluated for tenesmus and constipation resulting from atresia ani. The foal with perineum allowed faeces and urineto be excreted together, preventing complete intestinalobstruction. Surgical correction of the atresia ani wasperformed, along with resection of the incomplete urethra,nonfunctional penis and testes. The anal and perinealreconstruction procedures resolved the miniature donkey'sdifficulty in defaecation. The anourethral portion of therepair healed, but the anoperineal portion dehisced andhealed by second intention. The client was satisfied with theoutcome. Introduction Atresia ani is a congenital anomaly where the anal membranefails to break down, preventing passage of faeces, and hasbeen reported in domestic animals and man (Dreyfuss andTulleners 1989; Benamou et al . 1995; normal development, intestinal epithelium proliferates during earlygestation leading to temporary luminal obstruction, which thenregresses to maintain patency throughout the intestine. Failureof this regression has been described as imperfect canalisation(Johnson 1985). Other hypothesised aetiologies of atresia aniinclude rectal palpation and herpesvirus-1 infection(van Benamou et al . 1995). Atresia ani affects both horses and cattle, but horses often have concurrent urogenital abnormalities (Dreyfuss andTulleners 1989; Benamou et a developmental abnormality where theurethral meatus does not end at the tip of the glans penis (Brinkand Schumacher 2011), and is classified based urethral defect: perineal, theproximal urethral lesions are often associated with concurrenturogenital and other organ system anomalies when comparedto distal lesions (Bleul et al . 2007; Kraft et al . 2010). To the authors' knowledge this is the first description of atresiaani and perineal hypospadias in a miniature donkey foal. Wereport the clinical findings and surgical management in thiscase.Case summary History A 15 kg, 3-week-old, miniature donkey foal was admittedbecause of tenesmus and constipation observed since birth.Parturition was uneventful. The foal was reported to standunassisted and nurse normally. The foal's gender was unknowndue to abnormalities of the external genitalia, with suspicion ofhermaphroditism by the referring veterinarian. Since birth, thereferring veterinarian performed enemas every couple ofdays, which temporarily resolved the constipation, but thetenesmus and constipation recurred shortly thereafter. The foalwas referred for evaluation and potential surgical treatment. Clinical examination findings Upon presentation, the foal was bright and alert, and wasnursing normally. The foal's vital signs were within normalreference ranges, and there were 2 palpably descendedtestes. The urethra was incomplete extending from theperineum to the glans penis ( Fig 1a ). The penis was caudoventrally deviated, and there was no external lamina ofthe prepuce. There was a common opening on the perineumwhere both faeces and urine were excreted, resembling acloaca. During micturition, the urine streamed caudallythrough this common opening and then dripped distally downthe penis. The foal demonstrated no dysuria defaecate, The foal was sedated and examination of theperineum revealed a flap of tissue obstructing the externalanal sphincter ( Fig 1a ). When this flap of tissue was retracted dorsally, the external anal sphincter was visible ( Fig 1b ). Cranial to this flap of tissue and ventral to the anus, the dorsal aspectof the pelvic urethra was incomplete. A urinary catheter wasplaced retrograde into the bladder with no resistance andgrossly normal urine was aspirated. During defaecation, theflap of tissue obstructed faecal passage. With normal faecalconsistency, there was not sufficient space for the faeces tobe excreted through the common opening. Placing a fingerinto the common opening and through the external analsphincter, a digital rectal examination was performed. Noabnormal findings were detected aside from the impactedfaeces. An enema was successful in allowing faecal passage.There were no other congenital abnormalities detected onphysical examination. Complete blood count and serumbiochemistry profile were performed and were within normalreference ranges. With the abnormal reproductive tract, anintersex condition was considered and whole blood was \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd525 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER for karyotyping. Surgical reconstruction of the anus and perineum was recommended to alleviate the difficultly indefaecation. Treatment Surgical procedure The surgical plan included reconstruction of the anus andurogenital tract, resection of the penis and castration. A2-staged procedure was recommended due to the multiplesurgical procedures and the increased risk of contaminationduring the resection of the penis and castration. The first stagewould have included closure of the dorsal aspect of theurethra, extending a tissue shelf caudally to prevent faecesfrom contacting urethral mucosa, and resecting the flap oftissue covering the anus. Approximately 4 weeks later, thesecond stage would have included the resection of the penisand incomplete urethra on the perineum, the anoperinealphase of the reconstruction and castration. However,due to financial and transportation constraints, the ownerwanted the surgeons to attempt all procedures under thesame anaesthetic period. Antibiotics perineum and inguinal regions were prepared for asepticsurgery. A closed castration was performed and both spermatic cords were ligated with No. 0 braided lactomer (Polysorb) 1. The incisions were closed with 3-0 glycomer 631 (Biosyn)1in an intradermal pattern. The tissue between the anus/rectum andurethra was incised horizontally and approximately 2 cm inthe cranial direction. The shelf could then be retractedcaudally without tension, separating anus from the pelvicurethra. The incision was closed with a modification of thesingle-stage perineal laceration repair (Goetze a 4-bite with the suture knots buried in the anourethral shelf.This portion of the procedure resulted in caudal extension ofthe anourethral shelf, effectively directing the passage ofurine separate from the passage of faeces. The flap of tissueobstructing the anus was resected with a scalpel blade andthe skin edges were sutured to the periphery of the externalanal sphincter with 3-0 glycomer 631 in a simple interruptedpattern ( Fig 2 ). An elliptical incision was made in the skin surrounding the incomplete urethra on the perineum and extended distallyaround the penis. Sharp and blunt dissection was continued,isolating the penis from the abdominal wall. The corpus cavernosum penis (CCP), incomplete urethra, and (atrophied) corpus spongiosum were ligated together with an encircling ligature using 0 glycomer 631. Suturing the tunica albuginea over the transected CCP was considered, but since there wasno haemorrhage after the encircling ligature was applied, this Fig 1: a) Atresia ani and hypospadias extending from the perineum to the penis and penile curvature (chordee) in a 3-week-old miniature donkey. Dorsal is to the top of the images.There was a skin depression proximal to the common opening onthe perineum at the anticipated site of the anus (white arrow). Thepenis was caudoventrally deviated with no intact urethra (blackarrow), and the penis was not functional. b) Dorsal traction on theflap of tissue obstructing the anus allowed complete observation ofthe external anal sphincter (arrowhead). The common opening onthe perineum allowed the foal to pass urine and some faeces,but the faeces typically became impacted against the flap oftissue as is depicted in image a). Two descended testes werepalpated in the inguinal region (*). Fig 2: Perineum of the miniature donkey foal immediately followingcompletion of the reconstructive procedures. The foal is in dorsalrecumbency and ventral is to the top of the image. Note thereconstructed anus (arrow), the reconstructed tissue shelf betweenthe anus and urethra (anoperineal portion, arrowhead), andclosed incision following resection of the penis and a portion of theperineal urethra (brackets). \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd526 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015procedure was deemed unnecessary. The penis was transected distal to the ligature and removed. Bilaterally,incisions were made lateral to the urethral anddissected away from the perineum. The urethral mucosa wasresected from the penis to 5 cm distal to the reconstructedanus. The urethra was the widest at this location and excisionfurther proximally was suspected to have excessive tension onthe repair. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with 3-0glycomer 631 in a simple continuous pattern. The skin wasclosed with 3-0 glycomer 631 in an intradermal pattern. Thefoal recovered from anaesthesia without complication. Post operative management After surgery, the foal was able to urinate and defaecatewithout difficulty. Seven days post operatively, minordehiscence occurred at the dorsal aspect of the resectedpenile urethra, but the foal remained comfortable, andcontinued to nurse normally. A firm swelling was palpated overthe left inguinal incision, but the foal remained afebrile.Ultrasonographic examination of the swelling revealedthickened subcutaneous tissue with mixed echogenicity.Antibiotics and flunixin meglumine were continued for anadditional 2 days. During this time, the foal was observedlicking the inguinal incisions. Elizabethan collars of various sizeswere applied, but failed to prevent the foal from licking theincisions. Nine days post operatively, the swelling in the leftinguinal region increased and was painful to palpation.Surgical excision of the swollen tissue was performed due tothe suspicion of infection. With the foal anaesthetised, an elliptical incision was made over the inguinal swelling, and using sharp and bluntdissection, the distal end of the transected spermatic cord wasexposed. The firm swelling was isolated and resected with emasculators. The excised tissuemeasured The area was thoroughly lavaged with 0.9% saline, and primary closure was performed as describedabove. Dissection of the resected tissue revealed a smallamount of purulent exudate. Aerobic bacterial culture of theexudate yielded a pure growth of E. coli . No other complications developed during hospitalisation. Four daysafter the second surgery, antibiotics were changed totrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (20 mg/kg bwt orally, twicedaily for 10 days) based upon the bacterial culture andsensitivity results. The left inguinal incision remained slightlythickened and firm, but no signs of discomfort were observedwhen it was palpated. The foal was discharged from thehospital 8 days following the second surgery. Preliminarycommunication with laboratory personnel performing thekaryotyping supported a male genotype, but the final resultswere lost. Outcome The foal continued to thrive following hospital discharge andhad no further problems with defaecation. The anourethralportion of the repair successfully healed; however, theanoperineal portion had dehisced, and healed by secondintention. This left a single common opening on the perinealskin where urine and faeces were excreted together, was able to urinate anddefaecate without discomfort. The authors suggested anothersurgical procedure for reconstruction of the anoperinealregion, but the owner elected to not pursue further treatment since the foal had no constipation. At 12 months followinghospital discharge, the donkey had no further complicationsand had no difficulties in urination, defaecation or urinescalding. Discussion In normal embryonic development, the as sinus and rectum (Thomas 1989). Thisdivision occurs during the first trimester of development,supporting the theory that rectourethral anomalies developearly during gestation (Dreyfuss and Tulleners 1989).Congenital anomalies of the intestine, rectum and anus areencountered in domestic animals and can be in the form ofstenosis or atresia (Brown et al . 2007). Anal atresia is where a thin membrane occludes anal preventing normalpassage of faeces (van 1980). In thiscase, the external anal sphincter was obstructed by animperforate flap of skin not adhered to the sphincter. The lackof adherence to the external anal sphincter prevented acomplete obstruction. Atretic conditions have beenexperimentally induced with occlusion of blood supply to theintestinal segment, but the pathogenesis has also beenpostulated to be more complex (van der Gaag and Tibboel1980; Gourlay 2013). In horses, atresia of the colon has beenreported to occur twice as often as anal or rectal atresia(Benamou et al . 1995). Atresia ani is considered to be an inherited condition in pigs and calves, and has been suggested in horses (Kingstonand Park 1982; Benamou et al . 1995; Brown et al . 2007). The condition may be solitary, but can also be associated withother congenital abnormalities of the distal spine, urogenitaltract or atresia/agenesis of the colon (Chaudhry and Cheema1980; Brown et al . 1988, 2007; Nah et al . 2012). In sheep and human patients with atresia ani, a concurrent communicationwith the urogenital tract is often present, and may open ontothe perineum (Dennis 1974; Potter and Craig 1975). The authors used the term 'common opening' to describe the single orifice on the perineum that allowed excretion ofurine and faeces. In human females, this type of defect isreferred to as a cloacal malformation. This term encompassesa wide spectrum of developmental defects, but describesfusion between the vagina, urethra and rectum beforeopening onto a single perineal orifice (Thomas 1989). Since thisfoal was male and there was no observed fusion of thegastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, the authors felt that thisterm was inaccurate for this case. Animals affected with atresia ani typically present in the first few days of life due to the inability to pass faeces anddevelopment of secondary gastrointestinal distention. Thecommon opening in this foal allowed it to survive 3 weekswithout developing gastrointestinal distention. Diagnosis ofatresia ani is typically straightforward and is based uponphysical examination. If colonic atresia or urogenitalabnormalities are present, the animal may have patent anusand rectum, and contrast radiography (barium enema orurethrography) techniques may be required to identify allabnormalities (Kingston and Park 1982; Smith et al . 1992). Contrast radiography was considered in this case, but with thefoal's clinical signs resolving (albeit transiently) with enemas,easy passage of a urinary catheter into the bladder, and \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd527 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015normal digital rectal examination, as well as the financial concerns of the client, this procedure was deemedunnecessary. However, the authors recommend using contrastradiography if there is a history of abdominal distention orcolic. A single stab or cruciate incision into the anal membrane may resolve atresia ani in some cases, but with the higherincidence of concurrent urogenital abnormalities in horses, thiswould not be likely to be as successful as reported in calves(Gideon 1977; Cho and Taylor 1986). The authors consideredsimple transection of the flap of tissue obstructing the anus oranoplasty. Both of these procedures were postulated toresolve the foal's difficulty in defaecation. However, if onlyresected, there was concern of the tissue flap healing backover the external anal sphincter, leading to recurrence of thefoal's clinical signs. Anoplasty would probably have resolvedthe clinical signs and would have had more reliable healing,but reconstruction of the anourethral shelf was recommendedto prevent contamination of the urethral mucosa with faeceswhich, if not repaired, could have increased the risk ofascending urinary tract infections. However, the authors areunaware of any reports specifically documenting anincreased risk of infection in these cases. Historically,treatments for intestinal atresia in horses have had a graveprognosis. The successful outcome in this foal was attributedto less life-threatening abnormalities and the foal's goodhealth status before surgery (Smith et al . 1992; Benamou et al . 1995). Relative to other domestic animals, hypospadias is rare in horses with only a few cases described, most of which arelocated on the penis (Dennis 1974; Bleul et al . 2007; Kraft et al . 2010; Brink and Schumacher 2011). The dorsal aspect of thepelvic urethra fuses from migration of both sides of the ventralurethra, and with alterations in this development leading tohypospadias (Noden and De Lahunta 1985). The aetiology of hypospadias is notcompletely understood and is probably multifactorial,involving genetic, endocrine, maternal and environmentalfactors (Kraft et al . 2010). Penile curvature or chordee is the caudoventral deviation of the distal aspect of the penis and occurs due to thedevelopment of the corpus spongiosum and skin on the ventral aspect of the penis (Kraft et al . 2010). This condition accompanies penile hypospadias in all identified equinecases (Bleul De Lorenzi et al . 2010; Brink and Schumacher 2011). The foal may not have required resectionof the penis or incomplete urethra. However, urine dripping atthe end of micturition may have led to urine scald and theowner preferred the penis and incomplete urethra beremoved to avoid this possibility. Investigators have hypothesised intersex conditions may be a cause for multiple defects in domestic animals(Kumi-Diaka and Osori 1979; Bleul et al . 2007). In a report describing a mature stallion with hypospadias, testosteroneand oestrone sulfate levels were normal after human chorionicgonadotropin administration, and testicular tissue was normal.These results along with a normal karyogram were notconsistent with an intersex condition in this stallion (Bleul et al . 2007). Although the karyotype results for this foal were lost,preliminary observations by the laboratory were consistentwith a male genotype.The foal's ability to lick the surgical incisions and faecal contamination increased the risk of post operative infection.The dehiscence of the anoperineal portion was probably dueto faecal contamination and tension on the repair. In mareswith third degree perineal laceration, a 2-stage repair (Aanesmethod) to minimise obstipation, which maylead to dehiscence (Woodie 2011). In this case, one-stagerepair was chosen due to constraints of the client, and the foalwas not observed to have obstipation. Under idealcircumstances, the authors recommend a 2-stage repair asadvocated by other authors (Robertson and Embertson 1988). This report demonstrates the successful outcome of a miniature donkey foal with surgical treatment of atresia aniand hypospadias. Although genetics may not be the solecause of atresia or hypospadias, the authors recommend thathorses with these anomalies should not be bred (Gideon 1977;Kingston and Park 1982; Brink and Schumacher 2011). Withappropriate case selection, treatment of some of thesecongenital abnormalities can have a good prognosis. Authors' declaration of interests No conflicts of interest have been declared.

(2015) describe the successful repair of complex developmental abnormalities involving both the urogenital and the gastrointestinal tracts of a miniature donkey. Resecting the rudimentary penis and performing a perineal urethrostomy resolved the problems associated with hypospadias, andresecting a fold of skin overlapping the anus addressed problems associated with atresia ani. Atresia ani is a developmental disorder of the hindgut resulting in obstruction of the anal canal. It is a condition rarely encountered in horses, and most reports are limited to single cases (Chaudhry and Cheema 1980; Brown et al. 1988). The aetiology of anorectal malformations is incompletely understood, but recently, a familial inheritance pattern was identi ed in man, and animal studies have implicated abnormalities in the sonic hedgehog, Wnt5a and Skt signalling pathways (Herman and Teitelbaum 2012). Atresia ani is often accompanied by developmental abnormalities of the urogenital tract (Chaudhry and Cheema 1980; Brown et al. 1988), as in the case presented by Nelson et al. (2015). This association is not surprising considering that during early ontogenesis, the terminal portions of the urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts develop in concert. During normal development, the fetal cloaca is divided into the rectum and the urogenital sinus by the developing urorectal fold, as the fold reaches the cloacal membrane (Herman and Teitelbaum 2012). Abnormal division of the cloaca by the urorectal fold results in the development of a rectourinary stula. Normally, fusion of the urorectal fold and the cloacal membrane forms the primitive perineum. The portion of the cloacal membrane cranial to the primitive perineum is thereafter referred to as the urogenital membrane, whereas that portion of the cloacal membrane caudal to the primitive perineum is termed the anal membrane. Atresia ani occurs when the anal membrane fails to rupture (Vianna and Tobias 2005). Classi cation of anal atresia in the veterinary medical eld has been established for small animals where congenital anal stenosis ( anus combined with more cranial termination of the rectum as a blind pouch ( type III ), and discontinuity of the proximal rectum with normal anal and terminal rectal development ( type IV ) are distinguished (Aronson 2002). The lesion described by Nelson et al. (2015) is, however, dif cult to t into the above classi cation system because the skin fold overlapping the anus did not obstruct the anus -it only diverted faeces towards the perineum. In the human medical eld, a more practical classi cation scheme dividing the various rectal atresia etc.) has recently been adopted to replace the classi cation based on the patient 's sex and the level at which the arrest of the rectal descent occurred (Iwai and Fumino 2013). Hypospadias, a condition displayed by the a miniature donkey in the report by Nelson et al. (2015), is a developmental anomaly characterised by location of the urethral meatus on the ventral aspect of the penis proximal to its usual site on the glans penis. This condition is often accompanied by chordee (abnormal curvature of the penis, Fig 1 ), which is caused by the presence of a brous band on the ventral aspect of the penis and incomplete development of the corpus spongiosum penis (Brink and Schumacher 2011). Although common in men, hypospadias in horses has rarely been reported (Bleul et al. 2007; Brink and Schumacher 2011). Hypospadias is likely a manifestation of an endocrinopathy and may re flect abnormal or premature cessation of production of androgens by the fetal testes (Devine and Horton 1977), impaired sensitivity of the androgen receptor in the developing genitalia (Devine and Fig 1: Penile hypospadias and cordee in an adult gelding. Picture Universit / AE / OCTOBER 2015Horton 1977), or a delay in maturation of the hypothalamic- pituitary-testicular axis (Allen and Grif n 1984). In the male embryo, the phallus developing from the genital tubercule pulls forward the urethral folds, which are segments of the urogenital sinus. These elongating folds on the ventral aspect of the phallus form the urethral grove. Hypospadias is the result of the failed caudo-cranial fusion of the urethral folds. Hypospadias is classi ed according to where fusion of the urethral folds fails, and therefore, is classi ed as glandular, penile, penoscrotal, or perineal. Differences in the extent and timing of androgenic failure probably account for this variety of degrees of severity of hypospadias. Clinical signs of anorectal malformation depend largely on the presence or absence of a conduit through which faeces can be expelled. In cases of rectourinary stulas or anal stenosis, animals may be presented because of tenesmus, signs of urinary tract infection due to faecal contamination, and/or because of the abnormal appearance of the perineum. Foals af flicted by complete atresia ani are usually presented during the rst few days of life because of signs of abdominal pain and distension of the abdomen due to their inability to defaecate. Abnormal penile morphology associated with hypospadias is usually recognised by the owner when the flow of urine during urination is noted to be abnormal, and diagnosis of hypospadias is reached by physical examination of the external genitalia. Physical examination is suf cient, in most cases, to establish the diagnosis of atresia ani. Contrast radiographyand proctoscopy, however, are helpful in determining the presence of other developmental abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract, such as colonic atresia or a rectourinary stula. A rectourinary stula can occasionally be located by digital palpation of the vagina/vestibule or, if necessary,by using stulography. The de nitive treatment for foals affected with atresia ani and/or hypospadias is surgical correction. Treatment for hypospadias may become necessary because of soiling of the limbs with urine leading to contact dermatitis (Brink and Schumacher 2011). Depending on the extent of the lesion, treatment of horses for hypospadias usually entails partial phallectomy proximal to the abnormally located urethral meatus, rather than reconstruction of the urethra (Brink and Schumacher 2011). Small animals af flicted with type I atresia ani have been successfully treated using bougienage (Tomsa et al. 2011), but the authors are unaware of the use of this technique in horses as a treatment for atresia ani. In cases of atresia ani characterised by uncomplicated imperforate anus (type II ), with the anal sphincter present, anal reconstruction can be attempted. As with calves (Azizi et al. 2010), this procedure is best performed with the foal in sternal recumbency. A circular skin incision is created at the site where the anus normally would be located. The rectal pouch is identi ed using blunt dissection and apposed to the skin incision at 4 quadrants; the end of the pouch is then incised, and the edge of this incision is sutured to the edge of the circular skin incision using simple-interrupted sutures. If the anorectal malformation is accompanied by a rectovaginal/ rectovestibular stula, the skin of the perineum is incised in the frontal plane, midway between the ventral aspect of the anal incision and the dorsal commissure of the vulva. The incision is extended cranially beyond the stula, separating the stula into a dorsal, rectal hole and a ventral, vaginal/ vestibular hole. Each hole is closed with an inverting suturepattern using absorbable suture. The dead space remaining between the rectum and vestibule/vagina can be left unsutured to heal by second intention or closed using absorbable sutures, after which, the incised skin of the perineal body is sutured with interrupted, nonabsorbable, mono lament sutures. If atresia ani is complicated by the presence of colonic atresia, euthanasia is advocated because anastomosis of the colonic segments is usually unsuccessful (Nappert et al. 1992; Young et al. 1992), and colostomy, a salvage procedure often used in calves (Azizi et al. 2010), is impractical for foals. Prognosis of a horse after surgical correction of hypospadias is usually favourable and primarily in fluenced by the development of complications associated with partial phallectomy and/or perineal urethrostomy. Due to the small number of reported cases in horses and the diversity of anorectal malformations, the prognosis for foals af flicted with atresia ani should be established on a case-by-case basis, considering the presence of associated developmental abnormalities.

Brief Summary (For Full Prescribing Information, see package insert) CAUTION: Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. DESCRIPTION: Clodronate disodium is (dichloromethylene) salt and is manufactured from the tetrahydrate form. INDICATION: For the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Horses with hypersensitivity to clodronate disodium should not receive OSPHOS. WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. HUMAN WARNINGS: Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of accidental human exposure. PRECAUTIONS: As a class, bisphosphonates may be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Sensitivity to drug associated adverse reactions varies with the individual patient. Renal and gastrointestinal adverse reactions may be associated with plasma concentrations of the drug. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal impairment may increase plasma bisphosphonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution and renal function should be monitored. Use of bisphosphonates in patients with conditions or diseases affecting renal function is not recommended. Administration of bisphosphonates has been associated with abdominal pain (colic), discomfort, and agitation in horses. Clinical signs usually occur shortly after drug administration and may be associated with alterations in intestinal motility. In horses treated with OSPHOS these clinical signs usually began within 2 hours of treatment. Horses should be monitored for at least 2 hours following administration of OSPHOS. Bisphosphonates affect plasma concentrations of some minerals and electrolytes such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, immedi - ately post-treatment, with effects lasting up to several hours. Caution should be used when administering bisphosphonates to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyper-kalemic periodic paralysis, hypocalcemia, etc.). The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in horses less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skeleton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in breeding horses or pregnant or lactating mares. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of months to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the total dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Bisphosphonates have been shown to cause fetal developmental abnormalities in laboratory animals. The uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone may be greater than into maternal bone creating a possible risk for skeletal or other abnormalities in the fetus. Many drugs, including bisphosphonates, may be excreted in milk and may be absorbed by nursing animals. Increased bone fragility has been observed in animals treated with bisphosphonates at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair micro damage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; however, a causal relationship has not been established. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions reported in the eld study were clinical signs of discomfort or nervousness, colic and/or pawing.

Original Article Saddle tting, recognising an ill- tting saddle and the consequences of an ill- tting saddle to horse and rider S. Dyson*, S. Carsonand M. Fisher\u00a7 Centre for Equine Studies, Animal Health Trust, Lanwades Park, position; balance Summary A saddle that does not t either a horse or a rider correctly has potentially far reaching consequences for both horse andrider health. The saddle should be assessed off and on thehorse, without and with a rider. The t of the saddle for both the horse and rider must be evaluated. A well- tted saddle should distribute weight evenly via the panels to the horse 's thoracic region, with complete clearance of the spinous processes by the gullet. The saddle should remain fairly still during ridden exercise at all paces. The saddle must also t the rider to enable them to sit in balance. Signs of an ill- tting saddle include equine thoracolumbar pain, focal swellings under the saddle, ruf fling of the hair, dry spots under the saddle immediately after exercise surrounded by sweat, and abnormal hair wear. If a saddle does not t the rider, the rider may not be able to ride in balance with the horse, and this may induce equine thoracolumbar pain. A saddle of inappropriate size and shape for the rider may induce rider back pain, 'hip 'pain, sores under the 'seat bones 'and perineal injuries. Introduction A saddle that does not t either a horse or a rider correctly has potentially far reaching consequences for both horse and rider health. It is therefore important that veterinarians have some knowledge of saddle t and know how to recognise an ill- tting saddle. To understand the principle of saddle tting, it is necessary to have a basic knowledge of terminology (Glossary and Fig 1 ). This article focuses on English saddles and does not cover Western saddles, treelesssaddles and other saddles designed for speci c activities, e.g. endurance saddles or side saddles. Sophisticated equipment is generally not required to assess saddle t. Graphic pictures can be acquired using force mats and thermography, but it must be borne in mind that force distribution is integrally related not only to the to f the saddle, but also the shape of the horse and the position of the rider. Thermography assesses heat, which does not necessarily have any relationship with force and can be an unreliable tool for accurate assessment of saddle t (Society of Master Saddlers 2013). Asymmetrical force distribution is just as likely to arise from a crooked rider or lame horse as it is from an ill- tting saddle. If horse shape and soundness and rider position are assessed in conjunction, then force mat data can provide additional potentially useful information, but much can be learnt from a careful systematic appraisal of the saddle off the horse, the horse 's back, the saddle onthe horse and the saddle with a rider, not only standing still but also with the horse working. Scienti c reviews of the interactions between the horse, saddle and rider are provided elsewhere (Greve and Dyson 2013a; Dyson and Greve 2015). This review aims to providepractical information about saddle- t to the horse and rider and the consequences of inappropriate t. How to assess saddle t to a horse The interface between the saddle and the horse A well- tting saddle should have soft flocking, evenly distributed, with a flat, even bearing surface of the panels. The edges of the gullet should be smoothly rounded; the panels should support and cover the tree. The gullet width should be uniform from cranial to caudal and have a minimum width of at least 5 cm. In general terms, when the saddle is placed on the horse 's back, the lowest point of the horse 's back should be aligned with the lowest part of the saddle. However, the site of the lowest part of the back varies among horses, depending on factors such as conformation and condition. The lowest part of the seat should be horizontal, and the saddle should not tip forward or backward ( Fig 2 ); this also needs to be assessed when ridden because the balance of the saddle may alter according to the gait. There should be uniform contact of the horizontal panels with the horse 's back, which should be evaluated by feeling under the saddle with a flat hand for any gaps or tight spots. There should not be any areas where there is either reduced contact or no contact between the panels and the horse 's back ( Supplementary Item 1 ). The most accurate method is to use coloured builder 's chalk powder. Thoroughly and uniformly dust the chalk powder into the horse 's coat over the saddle bearing area with a soft paintbrush. Carefully position a clean white cloth under the saddle and ride for approximately 20 min using the usual programme of exercises. Then assess the distribution of the chalk powder on the white cloth. Saddle contact can also be checked by looking at the grease on the saddle, if using the saddle without a numnah. Alternatively, dust the bottom of the saddle with talcum powder and see how it is distributed on the horse 's back. Another method is to soak the horse 's back thoroughly with water and then assess the distribution of water over the bottom of the saddle. Tight spots are usually found either side of the base of the withers, especially with close contact saddles. Also look at the distribution of sweat on the numnah under the saddle, or look for the presence of \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd533 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015dry spots on the back after exercise, which may indicate pressure points ( Supplementary Item 2 ). With conventionally flocked saddles the t of the panels is best assessed initially without a rider, but with an air- lled saddle this must be done with the girth tightened and a rider on the saddle; air is only distributed evenly when under pressure. The saddle should also be checked with the numnah /C6pad (saddle cloth) that the owner is going to use, because this makes a signi cant difference to the t (see below and also Pads and numnahs: what is their purpose?). Check that at least two ngers 'width aligned vertically can be inserted under the pommel when the rider is standing in the stirrups, both before and after exercise, i.e. there is clearance of at least 4 cm ( Fig 3 ). The gullet should not be in contact with the spine or the sides of the withers when a rider is on the saddle. Check that you can see through the gullet of the saddle from the front and back, bearing in mind that with a deep seated dressage saddle because of the curvature of the seat, it may not be possible to look all theway through. The width of the gullet and the width of the panels must be appropriate to the width and shape of the horse 's back, so that the panels do not extend beyond the width of the longissimus dorsi muscles and so that there is complete clearance of the spinous processes. The width and length of the saddle The width and length of the saddle must be suitable for theshape of the horse 's back. The tree points should be three ngers 'width (i.e. approximately 6 cm) behind the caudal aspect of the scapular cartilages. When the forelimbs are protracted the scapulae rotate backwards and should have freedom of movement. This can be assessed with the horse standing still, by palpation while each forelimb is pulledforward. The tree points should remain caudal to the caudal aspect of the scapular cartilages. The flexible front panels may overly the scapulae provided that the tree points are caudal to the scapulae. It is also necessary to check that the saddle stays behind the scapulae during exercise ( Fig 4 ).

Fig 3: The gullet is too low, with inadequate clearance of thespinous processes. The rider, standing in the stirrups, can onlyinsert a single nger, which is being compressed. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd534 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015The saddle tree should not extend beyond the top of the last rib (i.e. caudal to the 18th thoracic vertebra, T18). If thesaddle is too long it will compromise the function of themiddle gluteal and iliocostalis muscles ( Fig 5 ,Supplementary Item 3 ). It may also impair lateral bending because of pressure on the lumbar transverse processes. The length of the saddle has to be appropriate for both the horse and the rider and tting both the horse and the rider can be a problem with large riders and also growing children on ponies, especially in horses and ponies with short backs. Growingchildren may require a longer seat to accommodate a relatively longer thigh. It may be possible to increase the length and/or width of the seat without increasing the length of the tree in order to provide some compromise. The front of the ventral panels should be parallel to the side of the shoulder. The ventral panels should have uniform contact with the horse 's sides. Horses vary in both the width of their back and the angle of their sides, so the width of the tree and the angle of the tree must accommodate this (Supplementary Items 4 and 5). Saddle pads and numnahs Many riders use a rectangular or square saddle pad (sometimes called a saddle cloth) /C6a numnah contoured to the shape of the saddle underneath the saddle /C6a gel pad. There is no scienti c evidence to support any of the manufacturers 'claims about force distribution or shock absorption. Indeed, such pads and numnahs merely occupy space under the saddle and potentially compromise function of an otherwise appropriately tted saddle ( Supplementary Item 6 ). It is crucial when assessing saddle t that the t of the combined proposed combination of pads and numnahs is assessed, as described above. Any pad should be contouredat the front so that it ensures clearance of the spinous processes. The position of any straps attaching the front of a pad or numnah to the saddle should be appropriately positioned so that when done up the pad or numnah is notpulled out of alignment. The loop through which the girth straps pass should also be appropriately positioned so that the pad does not become ruckled when the girth is attached or during movement ( Supplementary Item 6 ). The pad should be long enough so that it extends beyond the caudal bearing surface of the panels of the saddle. It should be of a suf ciently flexible material so that its edges do not create friction sores. Pads and numnahs are prone to movement with exercise and it is important to check that they remain stationary and do not collapse onto the spinous processes and/or get displaced caudally. Girth straps and girths The girth straps should ideally hang vertically, so that the girth also lies vertically. This is in fluenced by both the position of the girth straps on the saddle and the shape of the horse; the girth will naturally move to the narrowest part of the horse 's thorax, which may be further forward than ideal in a horse with a barrel-shaped thorax and abdomen ( Supplementary Item 3 ). If the girth is too far forward this will tend to either tip the saddle forward and/or move the saddle forward. The girth should not interfere with the horse 's elbows when the forelimbs are retracted ( Supplementary Item 6 ). This can be assessed at rest by picking up each forelimb and pulling it backward. The use of a contoured girth, narrower at the elbow regions and wider under the sternum may allow more leeway for elbow movement, and also provide a larger area over which force is distributed. However, the length and width of the girth should be appropriate to the size and shape of the horse ( Supplementary Item 7 ). The girth should follow the contours of the thorax and have uniform contact without excessive pressure on either the cranial or caudal margins. With many dressage saddles and close contact saddles, short girths are used with the buckles directly on the horse 's side. This removes bulk from under the rider 's legs under the saddle flaps; however, this results in direct focal pressure on the horse 's muscles. Their position should not be too low in order to avoid interference with the elbow and should be on the widest point of the thorax, approximately atthe level of the shoulder. Girths are available in a number of materials, with or without elastic inserts. Worn elastic may result in the girth being over-tightened or allow excessive/unacceptable movement Fig 4: The tree points are too far forward and interfere with the scapulae. The saddle has been positioned too far forward, buteven if it was placed further back it tended to slide forwardduring exercise into this position. The saddle is therefore sittingtoo close to the scapulae, which rotate backwards during protraction of each forelimb. The proximity of the saddle to the scapulae raises the pommel and lowers the cantle. The frontpanel and saddle flap of a general purpose or forward cut saddle may overlie the scapulae without causing a problem,provided that the tree points do not impinge. Fig 5: The tree of the saddle is too long, extending beyond the18th thoracic vertebra. The position of the 18th rib is indicated bythe arrow. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd535 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015of the saddle. Elastic on only one end of the girth may result in the saddle being pulled slightly to one side. Ideally a girth should be tted centrally so that it is on a similar hole on the left and right sides, to equalise pressures. The saddle during exercise Saddle t must be assessed both statically and when the horse is being ridden to check that it does not move excessively, tip forward or backward or slip to one side ( Fig 6 , Supplementary Item 8 ). The saddle should remain central on the horse 's back in walk, trot and canter, with the seat approximately parallel to the ground, and the rider sitting in balance centrally on the middle of the tree. A little movement from side to side is normal, but the saddle should not swing from side to side or lift off the back ( Supplementary Item 8 ). If the saddle slips consistently to one side this may reflect an ill- tting saddle, a crooked rider, asymmetry of the horse 's back or, most commonly, hindlimb lameness (see Consequences of an ill- tting saddle to the horse; Fig 6 ). If a horse is working correctly, the back dimensions may increase during exercise and the saddle must be able toaccommodate this. Inspection and palpation of the horse 's back before and after normal ridden exercise are importantto identify focal areas of pain, which may re flect force concentration. If the saddle ts correctly, the horse should sweat uniformly underneath the saddle. The hair coat should remain flat. A saddle that appears to t a horse when standing at rest may not t when the horse is in correct work posture, with increased tightness of the panels, especially at the twist (the narrowest part of the tree), between the stirrup bars or because of a narrow gullet. This may impair the horse 's ability to move not only the spine, but also the scapulae and thoracic girdle. Saddle t for the rider The rider must be able to sit centrally in the seat, not tipping forward or back. The rider 's seat bones and thighs should have even contact. The rider 's position is in fluenced by the type of saddle (dressage, jumping, general purpose), the position of the stirrup bars and any knee or thigh rolls and the balance or otherwise of the saddle ( Fig 2 ,Supplementary Item 9 ). Irrespective of saddle design, when the rider 's legs hang they should not drift forward or backward. The rider should be able to stand in the stirrups and maintain their balance, both when stationary and when the horse is moving. The rider 's shoulder, tuber coxae ('hip') and heel should remain in the same vertical plane with alignment of centre of gravity of both the horse and the rider to enable the rider to be in balance. The shape, length and width of the seat and the position of the seams between the seat and the skirt (the flap overlying the stirrup bars) and the seat and the sweat flaps all have a huge in fluence on rider comfort and need to be appropriate for the rider. If the saddle is too wide for the rider it impacts on the orientation of the rider 's coxofemoral joints and in fluences both function and comfort. A saddle that is too narrow in the twist for the rider will cause signi cant discomfort in the perineal region. Male and female riders sit differently due to different shapes of the pelvis. A saddle designed for a male rider may tip a female rider slightly backward into a 'bucket seat 'posture. The alignment of the rider 's pelvis and the proximity to the pommel of the saddle also in fluence comfort of the genital region and must be assessed both with the horse standing still and in motion. The shape and height of the pommel both in fluence rider comfort. In general terms the length of the seat should allow the rider to place a hand 's breadth (i.e. approximately 10 - 12 cm) between themselves and both the front and back ofthe saddle. Recognition of an ill- tting saddle Identi cation of an ill- tting saddle requires inspection of the saddle off the horse ( Supplementary Items 10 and 11), on the horse without and with the rider and seeing the horse worked, performing the movements (for example including jumping, cantering downhill) that it might normally be expected to do. The entire bearing surface of the saddle should be inspected and palpated. A saddle with lumpy, uneven or excessively hard flocking is likely to cause discomfort. The presence of depressions in the flocking caused by storage of the saddle on a rack is undesirable (Supplementary Item 12 ). The symmetry of the flocking should be assessed bearing in mind that a saddle tter may have deliberately flocked or air- lled the saddle asymmetrically in order to accommodate asymmetry of the horse 's musculature ( Supplementary Item 13 ). Air- lled panels can Fig 6: Saddle slip to the left induced by hindlimb lameness. When the lameness was abolished by diagnostic analgesia thesaddle sat squarely. Saddle slip has induced some crookednessof the rider, who sat straight on normal horses. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd536 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015become de flated, resulting in inadequate protection from the tree ( Supplementary Item 11 ). Feel along the panels and gullet to check that there is complete coverage of the tree. If the gullet of the saddle is too narrow or too low it will interfere with thoracolumbar function and induce pressure on the spinous processes and pain ( Supplementary Item 8 ). If the tree points are too far forward the function of the thoracic sling and movement of the forelimbs may be impaired because of pain ( Fig 4 ). This may be re flected by shortened forelimb steps and an unwillingness to work on the bit. A saddle tree that is too long may impair function of the middle gluteal and iliocostalis muscles and restrict lateral bending (Fig 5 ,Supplementary Item 3 ). Similarly panels that extend beyond the caudal aspect of the tree, especially if they extend sideways, may restrict lateral bending in some horses. A saddle tree that is too wide may result in the saddle tipping forward ( Supplementary Item 9 ). If the saddle tips forward or backward it will result in focal force concentration. If a saddle tips forward it may bounce behind when in motion and may move from side to side excessively, causing torque forces in the mid-thoracic region ( Fig 7 ). A saddle tree that is too narrow will result in the saddle tending to perch and create excessive force, especially at the tree points (Supplementary Item 14 ). If the panels do not have even contact with the horse 's back, force will be concentrated with the potential to cause pain. A common problem is reduced contact under the centre of the saddle called bridging, with resultant increased forces under the back andfront of the saddle ( Supplementary Item 15 ). Consequences of an ill- tting saddle to the horse The use of an ill- tting saddle can have both short-term and long-term implications for the horse. Early warning signs include muscle soreness under the saddle. The horse mayflinch when being groomed, or behave abnormally when being tacked up. This may be manifest as the horse moving to the back of the stable when the rider approaches with the tack, the horse dgeting when being tacked up, putting its ears back, and threatening to bite or kick. The horse may become hypersensitive to touch especially in the withers area and sometimes around the girth. This may in part be due to the phenomenon called wind up. There may be swellings under the saddle panels after exercise (Supplementary Item 16 ). (It should be borne in mind that soft swellings on the dorsal midline that appear transiently after ridden exercise are currently of unknown aetiology. It is curious that these only appear after ridden exercise, although it is dif cult to prove an association with saddle t.) There may be dry patches especially under the front of the saddle surrounded by sweat after exercise, re flecting focal pressure (Supplementary Item 2 ). Dry patches on the dorsal midline surrounded by sweat after exercise could indicate too many layers or too thick a layer beneath the saddle, lling up the gullet and pressing on the spinous processes ( Supplementary Item 17 ). If the saddle is moving too much during exercise the hair under the saddle becomes ruf fled; this is usually most obvious under the front of the saddle ( Supplementary Item 6 ). If the back of the saddle moves excessively, it may physically abrade the skin resulting in scabby skin lesions. Note that the binding on a numnah can create similar lesions. Longer-term indicators of poor saddle t include muscle atrophy, especially caudal to the scapulae resulting indepressions ( Supplementary Item 2 ), or elsewhere under the saddle. These may re flect a chronically poorly tted saddle and pressure points. Generalised muscle atrophy may re flect back stiffness and lack of proper function as the result of paininduced by the saddle-rider combination. In a young horse, achronically ill- tting saddle may compromise back function, resulting in failure of the epaxial muscles to develop properly.Careful palpation may reveal adhesions between the skinand underlying fascia; the skin cannot be moved over thefascia ( Supplementary Item 18 ). Alternatively, there may be deeper areas of brosis. White hairs appear when pressure (and perhaps heat or friction) has injured the hair follicles.However, these usually do not appear until the hair coatchanges. A common site is in the region of the tree points orthe twist of the saddle (the narrowest part) ( Fig 7 ). Bear in mind that ill- tting rugs can also result in the development of white hairs, especially on the dorsal midline caudal to thewithers. The hair under the saddle may become permanentlycurly, rather like the hair on limbs that are constantlybandaged. Abnormal movement of the saddle or ill- tting numnahs may result in abnormal hair wear that may be mostobvious in the winter, usually under the back of the saddle(Fig 7 ). Mild symmetrical hair wear can be normal, but asymmetrical hair wear usually re flects abnormal saddle movement. If the saddle constantly slips to the left, either as the result of asymmetry of the horse 's musculature, an ill- tting saddle, a crooked rider or hindlimb lameness, then hair wear will be asymmetrical. There will be a focal patch of intense hair wear close to the dorsal midline on the right and a more diffuse patch of less intensely worn hair further away from the dorsal midline to the left ( Fig 7 ,Supplementary Item 19 ). With respect to the horse 's performance, the consequences of an ill- tting saddle include a restricted forelimb step length, back stiffness, overall shortness of step, unwillingness to bend, and a tendency to become above Fig 7: There are focal patches of white hair under the cranial aspect of the saddle (black arrows) re flecting chronic pressure from either the twist of the tree or a gullet that was too narrow.There is asymmetrical hair wear under the caudal aspect of thesaddle associated with the saddle slipping to the left. There is amore focal patch of hair wear closer to the midline on the rightside, and a more diffuse area of less intense hair wear furtheraway from the dorsal midline to the left (white arrows). If saddleslip is chronic, this will result in asymmetrical distribution of thesaddle flocking, which could be misinterpreted as the cause of saddle slip, rather than an effect of saddle slip. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd537 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015the bit. These are obviously nonspeci c signs, but their presence indicates that saddle t should be assessed. Although the tendency of a saddle to constantly slip to one side, 'saddle slip '(Figs 6 and 8), may be the result of an ill-tting saddle, equine thoracolumbar asymmetry or rider crookedness, the most common cause is hindlimb lameness (Greve and Dyson 2013b, 2014). The presence of saddle slip is not related to the severity of lameness. The presence of saddle slip may actually be an indicator of subclinical lameness. The saddle most commonly slips to the side of the lame or lamer limb, but may slip toward the nonlame or less lame limb, or occasionally to both left and right in bilaterally lame horses. Saddle slip may induce the rider to sit crookedly so that when viewed from behind the rider tends to 'collapse 'on the side opposite to the side to which the saddle has slipped, so that the shoulder and tuber coxae are lower. Paradoxically, a well- tted saddle is more likely to slip than one that bridges. Saddle slip induced by lameness isusually much more obvious on one rein, is worst in canter andwith a lightweight rider or less-skilled rider, whereas saddle slipinduced by major equine thoracolumbar asymmetry may bepresent on the left and right reins. Consequences of an ill- tting saddle to the rider A saddle that does not t the horse can compromise equine thoracolumbar function and the resultant stiffening of thehorse 's thoracolumbar region may induce rider back pain. A saddle that does not t the rider may compromise their position and balance and induce back and/or hip pain. A seat that is too wide may result in abrasions under the rider 's seat bones. A seat that tips the rider toward the pommel, or places the rider too close to the pommel can result in perineal injury in either female or male riders. The more forward inclination of the female pelvis results in them being particularly at risk. Other factors to consider: changes in horses ' back dimensions Horses are not static in their shape. There is evidence that exercise can induce transient increases in the dimensions of a horse 's back presuming that the saddle /C6pads and numnahs t appropriately and the horse is working correctly i.e. 'on the bit '(Greve et al. 2015). These changes were measured at four predetermined locations: the shoulder (a point one-third of the distance between the point of the elbow and the point of the shoulder), and at the 8th [T8], 13th [T13] and 18th [T18] thoracic vertebrae, at 3 and 15 cm ventral to the dorsal midline. Within a 30 min exercise period the mean dimensions changed between 1 and 1.5 cm (more caudally than cranially). An ill- tting saddle prevented these changes occurring, which may have long-term consequences for muscle development and performance. Back dimensions also alter over time. In a longitudinal study of 104 sports horses monitored every 2 months over one year, with measurements acquired at the shoulder, T8, T13 and T18, there were considerable variations in back dimensions over one year (Greve and Dyson 2015a). The presence of gait abnormalities at the initial examination or pre-existing back asymmetry had a negative effect on changes in back dimensions. Subsequent improved saddle t, similar or increased work intensity, season (summer vs. winter) and increased bodyweight had positive effects on changes in back dimensions ( Supplementary Item 19 ). It is therefore concluded that because quanti able changes in back dimensions occur throughout the year, saddle t should be reassessed professionally several times a year, especially if there has been a change in work intensity. The use of the same saddle on more than one horse Ideally, each horse should have its own custom- tted saddle. Horses vary considerably in their individual shapes and sizes and for optimal function and performance a well- tting saddle is crucial. Saddle t can sometimes be improved by the use of numnahs, pads or shims, but while these may redistribute forces with short-term improvement in performance, this is unlikely to be a long-term solution for a saddle that does not t. Some saddles have air pockets that can be lled to mould to the horse 's back and thus adapt the saddle to asymmetries of the horse 's back. The amount of air can be adjusted to accommodate changes in back shape. Compression of air does not have the same effect as compression of conventional flocking, which may lead to impaction of flocking, and thus the risk of pressure points may be reduced. However, the use of an air- lled saddle is not recommended as a method to adapt a single saddle for regular use on more than one horse. Air- lled saddles Fig 8: Saddle slip to the left and an inherently crooked rider. The rider 's right shoulder is lower than the left; her body has concavity on the right side and the right elbow is lower than the left. Herseat has moved to the left. The right leg is drawn up and the heelis higher than the toe. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd538 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015should be professionally adjusted for optimal t to a particular horse. Some saddles have an adjustable tree so that the angle at the front can be changed, to accommodate the shape of a particular horse. This is a good option if a horse tends to change shape frequently under the front of the saddle, without changing shape further back beneath the saddle. However, there are data indicating that, if a horse changes shape underneath the front of the saddle, this is often accompanied by changes at the level of the back of the saddle as well (Greve and Dyson 2015a). Changing the width of the front of the tree will not necessarily allow the saddle to follow the shape of the horse 's entire back. If only one part of the tree ts well, it is no better than having a saddle in which the whole tree does not t. It is not easy to adjust the tree quickly and accurately. Buying saddles with adjustable trees tot many horses is not advisable. They should be tted and adjusted to a speci c horse by a trained tter. If a professional yard has more horses than saddles it is recommended that each horse-saddle combination is assessed and each horse should be assigned one of two saddles that provide best t. This will need to be reassessed periodically. Pads and numnahs: what is their purpose? A well- tted saddle should not need anything underneath it. A numnah or saddle pad (saddle cloth) can be used to keep the bottom of the saddle clean, to carry a sponsor 's logo or to change the appearance of the horse 's back. The use of pads and numnahs has risen hugely in popularity for no logical reason with respect to thoracolumbar function. A thick numnah or saddle pad can alter the t of an ill- tting saddle in a positive way in the short term by altering the distribution of forces, but it is not a long-term solution for the best comfort of the horse. Numnahs and pads can change the balance of a well- tting saddle and can narrow the space available between the gullet and the horse 's spine and restrict muscle function ( Supplementary Item 17 ). Adding a pad to a saddle that was already too narrow has a negative effect. Adding a thick pad can unbalance a saddle that is sitting level without a pad. If the balance of the saddle is not to be altered only a thin numnah or saddle pad should be used. A riser pad elevates the entire saddle, either uniformly, or the front or the back of the saddle preferentially. For examplea riser pad that raises the back of the saddle may be used if the saddle slopes down toward the cantle. Alternatively shims (wedge-shaped pads) can be used to selectively raise one part of the saddle. If the saddle slopes backward, shims can be placed under the back of the saddle. Usually these saddles are too narrow or have insuf cient depth of gusset at the rear and lifting the back of the saddle improves the balance. However, it may result in the tree points being pushed into the withers. It may increase pressure on the spine and create a large 'bridging 'area with reduced contact beneath the centre of the saddle. If the saddle is too wide,shims can be added under the front until the saddle can bereflocked or the tree or panels adjusted. The shim con guration may need to be altered frequently, as often as every month, if the horse is changing shape. Air- lled panels may provide a better solution than temporary shims or riser pads.A gel pad will not improve the t of a well- tted saddle. Promotional materials claim that a gel pad acts as a shock absorber, but there is little scienti c evidence to support this. It may limit movement of the saddle to some extent, but this may result in overheating of the back. Gel pads are usually placed over a saddle pad, and beneath the saddle. There are also thin, 'lace-like 'gel pads that are speci cally marketed as antislip pads and there has been a recent trend, especially for event riders, to place these directly against the skin. These generate shear forces and a lot of heat, usually resulting in extreme back soreness (Supplementary Items 18 and 20). Any numnahs and saddle pads must provide clearance of the spine; it should still be possible to insert 2 ngers 'width (i.e. 4 cm) between the numnah and the spine and the sides of the withers with a rider on the horse. The numnah and pad should be of the appropriate shape and size to t both the horse and the saddle. They are frequently bought without any thought to either of these features. If a pad or numnah is too small, it may create a ridge of pressure at the edge (Supplementary Item 21 ). Numnahs and pads vary in their construction; some have very rm edges that can create focal pressure points (Supplementary Item 22 ). Some have stitching around the periphery and if this line of stitching is, for example, directly under the back of the saddle this can create friction and pain ( Supplementary Items 14 and 22). One function of a numnah or pad can be to absorb sweat. It is crucialtherefore, that pads and numnahs are washed very frequently to maintain hygiene and softness. Horses 'skin may react to biological washing powders, so a nonirritant washing powder should be used. Other saddle t accessories Saddle t accessories, such as a breast-plate or a crupper may be used to hold a saddle in position in extreme situations, but if required daily to keep a saddle in position, the saddle does not t the horse properly. A breast-plate should not be used to lock the saddle in position. This may cause a continuous pressure on the chest and shoulder, or the caudal aspect of the scapulae, due to the tree points being held forward and thus restrict the movement of the forelimbs. A breast-plate must be tted to the horse so that it does not interfere with the shoulder movement. Other factors that will in fluence the horse, saddle, rider interaction Many horses have some degree of left-right asymmetry of the back dimensions, which may be apparent visually (Supplementary Item 13 ), but can be more objectively assessed using a flexible curve ruler contoured to the shape of the horse 's back. Marked asymmetry in the shoulder region in particular has a potentially large in fluence on the position and movement of a saddle and the gullet plate and/or panel flocking of the saddle may need to be adjusted accordingly to accommodate such asymmetry. Riders may also be asymmetrical. This may be inherent asymmetry or an acquired postural asymmetry. When viewed from behind at all paces a rider should sit so that their shoulders and tuber coxae are level. In a survey of 276 riders, 37% sat crookedly when viewed from behind (Greve and \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd539 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015Dyson 2014) ( Fig 8 ). Asymmetry is likely to result in uneven force distribution, which may compromise function of thehorse 's back. A rider should also be able to maintain a stable position, with the shoulder, 'hip'and heel in alignment, moving in rhythm and balance with the horse. If a rider is not in balance then their weight distribution is likely to compromise equine thoracolumbosacral function. Rider body size relative to the horse is a potential issue, but is dependent on many factors including the type, speed and duration of work and rider skill and balance (Clayton et al. 2015). The veterinary profession is in a position to provide advice concerning rider size and bodyweight relative to horse size and type. Although there are no scienti cally validated studies, as a general guide the ratio between rider and horse bodyweight should not greatly exceed 20% (Supplementary Item 23 ). In a survey of 506 sports horses in normal work, minor thoracolumbar left-right asymmetries (0.6 cm) at T8 and T13 were common and signi cantly associated with the weight of the rider, the ratio of the weight of the horse and rider and previous rider injuries (Greve and Dyson 2014). This could indicate that the repetitive force applied by a heavy rider with an asymmetric position on the horse is likely to place abnormal stress on the horse 's back and contribute to the development of small muscular asymmetries. Saddle storage and maintenance Saddles should be cleaned at least weekly to maintain softness and suppleness of the leather. This may be with a damp cloth or sponge using warm water, followed by application of saddle soap and/or a leather food and oil as necessary, or an all-in-one product that cleans and protects leather. How saddles are stored can have a large in fluence on the contour of the panels. Conventional commercially sold saddle racks usually create grooves on the lower surface of the saddle. Saddles are best stored on an even surface; tubular or V-shaped saddle racks covered with padding may be best. The prevalence of saddle-related problems In a UK study assessing 506 sports horses in regular work, 18.4% were ridden in ill- tting saddles with uneven contact along the length of the horse 's back, and in 32.8% the saddle was unbalanced, tipping backward in 20.4% and tipping forward in 12.5% (Greve and Dyson 2014). This presumably re flects that a high proportion of riders cannot detect poorly- tting saddles and do not recognise the importance of a correctly tting saddle for both optimal comfort and performance of the horse. In a related UK survey, only approximately 12% of riders had their saddle- t assessed professionally more than once yearly (Greve and Dyson 2015b). Crooked riders and equine thoracolumbarregion asymmetries were associated with ill- tting saddles, presumably re flecting the uneven force distribution on the horse 's back caused by poor sitting posture of the rider and further exacerbated by areas with peak force related to the ill- tting saddle. Better education of riders, trainers and veterinarians for assessment of saddle- t is required. Early recognition of an ill- tting saddle may provide an opportunity to reduce the risk of compromised thoracolumbosacral movement, development of back pain, muscle atrophy and deterioration in performance because of an ill- tting saddle.Who is quali ed to provide professional advice on saddle t? In the UK, the Society of Master Saddlers (www.mastersaddlers.co.uk) provides training courses and examinations for saddle tters, who should be able to judge the t of a saddle correctly and provide appropriate adjustments to ensure an ideal t. However, it is unrealistic to expect that traditionally trained saddle tters will have an in- depth knowledge of all the different makes and designs currently available. Many commercial companies selling saddles train their own tters. These people may be well- trained in the tting and adjustment of their own saddles, but are not necessarily quali ed to t and adjust other makes of saddle. In the UK and Europe the Master Saddle Fitting Consultant Society (www.msfc.nl) provides training courses for saddle tters that embrace both the horse and rider. In North and South America, Africa, Australia and Europe, Saddle t4 Life also provides training courses with a high emphasis on saddle t for both the horse and rider (www.saddle t4life.com). Some physiotherapists provide specialist advice on rider position, providing analyses of rider posture and movement by a series of manoeuvres performed while standing on their feet and then objectively assessing the position of the rider on a mechanical horse. Exercises can be prescribed to address speci cally asymmetries in posture, which can compromise equine thoracolumbosacral movement. Conclusions Correct saddle t for horse and rider is an important equine welfare issue and the veterinary profession needs to recognise this and be at the forefront of helping to educate the horse owning public. Ideally veterinarians should work in conjunction with professional saddle tters, trainers and physiotherapists to improve both horse and rider comfort. Authors 'declaration of interests S.

Close contact saddle : The close contact tree is flat with a shallow gullet and therefore sits very close to the horse 's dorsal midline. The saddle usually has only one layer separating the rider 's limbs from the horse 's sides (i.e. no individual sweat flap and saddle flap; mono flap), and therefore uses a short girth. Flocking : The material that lls the panels -wool, felt, synthetic material, air or a combination. Gel pad : A silicone-based pad placed under the saddle, usually over a saddle pad, purportedly to provide more comfort for the horse. Some are perforated with holes allegedly to 'make the pad breathable '. Thin lace-like gel pads are also sold that are placed directly on the horse to try to prevent the saddle moving. Girth : The girth holds the saddle in place, attaching by straps to the left and right sides of the saddle. Girths vary considerably in width, shape and the material(s) from which they are constructed. Traditional girths had parallel sides; many modern girths have contoured margins to provide room for the elbow and a larger bearing surface under the thorax. Girth guard : A piece of material, usually leather, which can slide up and down the girth straps, designed to cover the girth buckles. Girth straps (billets) : The straps to which the girth is attached; the number and position of straps varies among saddles. The optimal position varies depending on the shape of the horse. Gullet : A term used variably to describe the area under the pommel or the channel between the panels (panel channel). Gullet plate or head plate : A plate of steel or synthetic material that forms the front part of the tree, which determines the width of the gullet and the angle of the front panels. In some saddle designs it is adjustable or interchangeable. Gusset : A term used to describe a wedge-shaped piece sewn in under the ventral part of the front saddle panel (withers or front gusset) or more commonly a wedge-shaped piece sewn in under the caudal part of the saddle, caudal to the saddle flap. The latter can increase the weightbearing area in the caudal panel area and make it flatter than a nongusseted saddle which tends to have a more convex ventral pro le. Half numnah : A numnah that only covers the underside of the dorsal (seat) part of the saddle. Head plate or gullet plate : A plate of steel or synthetic material that forms the front part of the tree, which determines the width of the gullet and the angle of the front panels. In some saddle designs it is adjustable or interchangeable. Knee roll : A roll usually on the cranial aspect of the sweat flap, or built into the flap of a close contact saddle, providing support for the rider 's leg.Numnah : A saddle-shaped pad of variable thickness, usually made of sheepskin or synthetic material, placed under the saddle. Panel : The horizontal panels cover the underside of the tree and provide the interface between the saddle and the horse; the front panels extend ventrally from the cranial aspect of the saddle, covering the underside of the head or gullet plate. Panel channel : The space between the left and right panels, sometimes called the gullet. Pommel : The front of the saddle. Rails: The left and right parts of the tree, covered by the panels. Riser pad : A pad designed to raise the saddle, either uniformly or more at the front (cranially) or more at the back (caudally). Saddle pad or saddle cloth : A usually rectangular-shaped pad of variable thickness placed under the entire saddle; a well-designed pad is contoured so that the mid portion sits upunder the gullet of the saddle, without causing pressure on the dorsal midline of the horse. Saddle flap: The layer, usually leather, which overlies the girth straps. Seat : The part of the top of the saddle on which the rider sits. Shims : Wedge-shaped pads used to selectively elevate the front or back of the saddle, unilaterally or bilaterally. Skirt: The short flap that overlies the stirrup bars. Stirrup bars : The bars from which the stirrup leathers and stirrups are suspended; these are riveted to the tree and in some saddles their length and/or position may be altered to optimise their position for the rider 's leg length. Sweat flap: In a conventional saddle (as opposed to a mono flap saddle), the layer that covers the horse 's side, over which the girth straps lie. Thigh roll : A roll on the caudal aspect of the sweat flap, or in a close contact saddle, built into the flap, to inhibit the rider 's legs from moving too far backward. Tree: The framework of the saddle, formerly made of wood, but now often made of carbon bre or other synthetic material such as polyurethane. Tree point : The ventral aspect of the head or gullet plate; in modern saddles they are either straight or directed caudally. Twist : The narrowest part of the tree and seat of the saddle.

Duringridden exercise the back of the saddle bounced up anddown.Supplementary Item 2 : A dry patch under the cranial aspect of the saddle after exercise (arrows) re flecting excessive pressure. There is also a focal patch of white hair and muscleatrophy. The saddle and pad combination tted poorly; with adjustments this horse sweated more uniformly. Supplementary Item 3 : Two rather overweight horses with a barrel-shaped thorax and abdomen. a) The girth is pulled forward into the narrowest portion and as a result the saddle tipped and moved forward and bounced behind. The rider used a saddle pad with rubber insets under the saddle, on both the saddle and horse sides of the pad. b) An H-girth has been used to avoid the saddle being pulled forward. The seat of the saddle is long for this short backed horse. Supplementary Item 4 : The concept of tree t: the angle of the tree points being parallel to the horse 's side and of appropriate width for the horse 's back. To the left, a correctly tted tree: the angle of the tree points is parallel to the angle of the horse 's side, so that the two green lines are parallel. To the right the tree point angle is more acute than the angle of the horse 's side, so the two red lines converge ventrally. In reality the tree obviously sits higher off the horse, covered bythe panels, so the to fa 'bare tree 'should be assessed by lifting it 2 -3 cm. When assessing a whole saddle the front face of the panel should be parallel with the horse 's side. Both the angle of the tree points and their width need to t appropriately. Two horses could have a similar angle of slope of their sides but differ in width; similarly two horses could be of similar width just behind the withers, but the angle of slope of their sides may differ considerably. Supplementary Item 5 : The concept of width of the tree and angles of the tree points. a) The diagram represents two horses of similar width but different angles of slope of their sides. b) The diagram represents two horses of different widths, but similar angles of slope of their sides. Supplementary Item 6 : a) The girth straps are pulled forwards. The saddle perched, with the combination of the saddle pad and thick half numnah, effectively making the saddle too narrow. The rider felt tipped backward. The girth is also too long and when fully tightened ruckled the edge of the saddle pad. b) As the left forelimb is retracted the point of elbow comes into contact with the girth. Supplementary Item 7 : A contoured girth of inappropriate length and tting. A hand could be inserted under the front of the girth at the sternum. There was intense focal pressure along the tight caudal margin of the girth and marked pain. The maximum concavity on the cranial margin of the girth is proximal to the elbow. In some horses, this design of girth sits differently when the horse is moving compared with standing still, with the front of the girth coming into contact with the sternal region resulting in a more even pressure distribution. Supplementary Item 8 : A narrow gullet and a tendency of the saddle to move to the right and bounce up and down caudally. The entire back of the saddle raises off the horse 's back. The saddle pad does not permit complete clearance of the spinous processes caudally. Supplementary Item 9 : The saddle was tight at the tree points because it is too wide and tips forward. The cantle is high and the seat is very wide (arrow). As a result the small female rider had constant hip joint pain and found it dif cult to maintain balance with the horse. The rider may have been \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd542 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015more comfortable if the saddle was balanced correctly. Supplementary Item 10 : The horizontal panels of the saddle are asymmetrically flocked; the left side has more flocking than the right. From the front view the vertical panels are also asymmetrical: the right side was softer and more compressible than the left. The saddle slipped to the right. There was no saddle slip with a more symmetrically flocked saddle. If a saddle is not re flocked regularly an asymmetric rider or horse may induce these asymmetries. Alternatively, the saddle may have been flocked asymmetrically to accommodate previous asymmetry, but not readjusted appropriately. Advice should be sought from a professional saddle tter. Supplementary Item 11 : This air- flocked saddle is inadequately in flated so that the panel is readily depressed by light thumb pressure resulting in a hard ridge of the tree (arrows), which was pressing into the horse 's right side, causing focal pain. The air- flocking had not been checked for>2 years. Air flocking should be soft and is best assessed by applying pressure with the palm of the hand; the thumb pressure here is to highlight how the tree is inadequately concealed. Supplementary Item 12 : Depressions in the flocking of the panels (arrows) caused by storage on a saddle rack. Supplementary Item 13 : Asymmetry of the shoulder musculature which is much more developed on the right side (arrows). The saddle tended to slip to the left. Supplementary Item 14 : The saddle is too narrow so that the saddle perches on the horse 's back. The tree points were excessively tight and this is compounded by the saddle pad which has a thick half underlayer, lling the gullet. The saddle bridged. The seat of the saddle tips back. The horse moved more freely with a longer forelimb step length when ridden in a better tting saddle. Supplementary Item 15 : a) The saddle bridges and tips backward. The saddle pad is too short so that the stitching around the border is under the caudal aspect of the saddle. b) A pad with a sheepskin pad on the underneath, which does not follow the contours of the horse 's back. There is no clearance of the spinous processes under the back of the pad. Supplementary Item 16 : a) Focal ruf fling of the hair under the cranial aspect of the saddle (arrows) after exercise re flecting movement of the saddle. b) Focal swelling under the cranial aspect of the saddle immediately after exercise re flecting abnormal pressure. Supplementary Item 17 : A saddle, thick pad and numnah that completely pack the gullet of the saddle. The horse was uncomfortable during work and after 30 min ofexercise, the dimensions at the level of the eight thoracic (T8) vertebra (arrows) had reduced compared with before exercise (to the left). When the thick pad and numnah were removed the horse worked much better and the dimensions at T8 increased with exercise (photograph courtesy of Line Greve). Supplementary Item 18 : a) A gel pad being used underneath a saddle pad and a half numnah. The saddle was too tight at the tree points, accentuated by the padding. The seat tipped back and the saddle bounced. The saddle moved slightly to the right on the left rein. The horse showed marked resentment of being tacked up. b) The antislip gel pad under saddle was causing shear forces; the fascia under the cranial aspect of saddle was adherent to the skin in the highlighted area (arrows); the area was larger on the right than the left and slightly less close to the dorsal midline, re flecting the slight saddle slip. Supplementary Item 19 : The same horse in March (a) and May (b); the horse has enlarged considerably in back dimensions associated with professional saddle t in March. Note also the asymmetry of shoulder musculature in May (b), being larger on the left side (white arrow) and the discolouration of the hair in the right caudal saddle region (arrow heads) associated with a tendency of the saddle to move to the right ( gure courtesy of Line Greve). Supplementary Item 20 : A large scabby skin lesion in the caudal saddle region the result of a gel pad 'burn '. The area was extremely painful. Supplementary Item 21 : The saddle tips backward; the tree extends beyond the 18th rib. The front face of the panels are not parallel with the horse 's side. The saddle is placed on a numnah and a thick half pad which created a ridge under the front panels. The ventral parts of the panels are therefore not in contact with the horse 's side. The saddle tted poorly and the use of half pad has done nothing to improve the situation. Supplementary Item 22 : a) A saddle pad with stiff margins resulting in hair wear on the cranioventral aspect (arrows). The horse was highly reactive to palpation in this region and kicked aggressively. b) Focal swellings and abnormal hair (arrows) under the caudal margin of a stiff saddle pad associated with marked soreness. Such problems may be reduced if owners are advised not to clip the area occupied by the saddle and pads. Supplementary Item 23 : The rider is too large for both the saddle and the horse. Note the way in which the well- tted numnah follows the contours of the gullet of the saddle. This is the same saddle as Fig 5. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd543 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015Review Article Cytology of the lower respiratory tract in horses: An updated review F. Cian*, P.

Please refer to the changes in italics and correction statement in bold.] Summary The diagnosis of respiratory diseases in horses can be dif cult due to the nonspeci c nature of the clinical signs, which overlap between the different diseases. Cytological examination of the respiratory secretions is a helpful diagnostic tool that, when combined with clinical features and other diagnostic techniques, has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy signi cantly. This review article should help readers to become familiar with the cytology of thenormal respiratory tract and with the cytopathologicalabnormalities associated with common respiratory disordersin horses. Introduction Recent National Equine Health Surveys in the UK have identi ed respiratory disease as the fourth most common health concern of primarily leisure horse owners (Slater 2013, 2014). Given that ef cient respiratory gas exchange is a fundamental priority in a successful athletic animal, such concerns may well be magni ed in the competitive sectors. Respiratory disease frequently presents with obvious clinical signs such as nasal discharge, cough, adventitious noises and abnormal breathing patterns/effort, although the possible existence of undetected respiratory disease should not beunderestimated in performance animals that frequently demonstrate no adverse effects, other than limitation of their athletic performance. As well as a standard clinical examination with auscultation, additional commonly used diagnostic techniques for suspected respiratory disease include measurement of systemic in flammatory biomarkers, blood gas analysis, endoscopic examination of the airway and collection of samples of respiratory secretions (Mair 2010). A speci c diagnosis may require multiple diagnostic techniques. Careful selection and interpretation of test results is crucial for accurate diagnosis since there may be similar ndings in multiple clinical (and subclinical) conditions. For example, both infectious and allergic airway diseases might manifest similarly in an individual horse and may yield similar cytological ndings from tracheal wash (TW) and/or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). However, consideration of other factors such as age, environment and in-contact morbidity, along with systemic in flammatory biomarkers,serology and bacteriology may aid in distinguishing the two conditions. This review will focus on the cytological ndings of the normal respiratory tract and abnormal conditions that are commonly seen in equine practice. Detailed description of the collection techniques is beyond the scope of this article and the reader is referred elsewhere for this (Mair 2010). Percutaneous aspirates from the trachea (transtracheal aspirates) may be conducted to limit the possibility of contamination with naso-oropharyngeal bacteria, although the presence of bacteria in healthy horses may be influenced by the husbandry and whether the horses are free to move, con ned or have their heads tied in an elevated position. Quantitative bacteriological cultures may be of bene t in determining if infection is likely in the absence of inflammation (Christley and Rush 2007). Transendoscopic tracheal sampling (TW) carries a high risk of sample contamination with nasopharyngeal organisms, although careful technique including mild sedation, laryngeal desensitisation and the use of double-lumen catheters may lead to collection of acceptable microbiological samples. Tracheal wash cytology is a tool that may be sensitive in the detection of airway disease, although it may lack speci city since the reference intervals for differential cell counts andother criteria for interpretation vary markedly betweenlaboratories and may be in fluenced by the conditions under which horses are kept and a variety of management factors. Bronchoalveolar lavages generally obtain samples with more useful cytology results, especially in diffuse respiratorydisorders. However, if the disease is localised, sampling of anarea not affected by the process may yield anonrepresentative sample. Microbiological results of BALs may be more dif cult to interpret unless a profuse growth of a pathogen is obtainedsince samples are commonly contaminated with naso-oropharyngeal organisms during the collection procedure. Cytological preservation is generally good in BAL samples and reference intervals are less variable between horses andlaboratories. Samples can be collected via an endoscope wedged into a distal airway or via a cuffed BAL catheterpassed without endoscopic guidance. Sedation is frequently required for successful collection of a BAL sample as the procedure invariably causes coughing, and should probably be avoided in horses showing marked signs of respiratory disease. Rest from exercise is also generally recommended for up to 2 days following the procedure. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd544 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE to you...Recommendwith confidence *avocado/soybean unsaponi ablesThe combination of glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate plus ASU * has been shown in cartilage cell studies to be more effective than glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate alone at inhibiting expression of several components involved in the breakdown of cartilage.

Firstly, the sample should be examined macroscopically. A representative sample obtained from a TW generally appears cloudy with variable amounts of mucus and debris, whereas clear transparent fluid may re flect inadequate sampling (Bain 1997) ( Fig 1 ). BALs should be examined grossly for the presence of foam (surfactant) and turbidity (mucus and/or cells). Normal fluid should appear clear or mildly turbid. Increased turbidity is usually associated with higher cellularity. Pink-red or yellow-brown colour may indicate the presence of haemorrhage (Hoffman 2008). Tracheal wash and BAL samples are commonly placed into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and plain tubes. Placement of respiratory cytology samples in EDTA tubes may be of bene t for preservation of cellular morphology, but may be less satisfactory for bacterial cultures since EDTA is reported to have bacteriostatic activity. Separate aliquots for bacterial culture should be submitted in plain tubes without additives. If there is a delay in cytological processing of >12 h, samples should be refrigerated or xed in order to prevent in vitro bacterial proliferation and cellular degeneration. Fixation of specimens by addition of an approximately equal volume of 10% buffered formalin or 40% ethanol immediately following collection allows for delayed processing (up to one week), but is unsuitable for subsequent air-dried preparations with Romanowsky-staining. Fixated samples require special of 's trichrome. (Pickles et al. 2002). Commonly used Romanowsky stains that can be applied to air-dried preparations include Diff-Quik, Wright-Giemsa, and May-Grunwald-Giemsa (Bain 1997). Fast Romanowsky type stains (e.g. Diff-Quik) are not appropriate for the detection of mast cells. Therefore, metachromatic dyes that reliably identify mast cells (e.g. Leishman 's and toluidine blue stains) should be used if evaluation of these cells in lower respiratory tract samples is undertaken (Hughes et al. 2003). Due to the nature of the sampling method, both TW and BAL samples can be of low cellularity and usually need to be concentrated prior to cytological evaluation using either a cytocentrifuge or a table-top centrifuge. When a traditional centrifugation system is used, the supernatant is poured off and the remaining pellet is gently smeared on a slide. Each laboratory should develop a standard method for the preparation and examination of these samples. Cytology of the normal respiratory tract Cytology is a useful and integral part of the clinician 's approach to respiratory tract problems in horses. An initialunderstanding of the normal cellular features is essential forrecognition of deviations associated with commonpathologic disorders. Tracheal wash cytology Samples can be obtained either with an endoscopic or transtracheal approach. Cytological features observed on examination of TWs in normal horses re flect the composition of the respiratory tractsurface ( Fig 2 ). There are no universally accepted reference intervals for TW differential cell counts; the reference intervals used in the laboratory of the authors are provided in Table 1 . Samples are usually composed mostly of ciliated and nonciliated respiratory columnar epithelial cells ( Fig 3 ). Fig 1: Macroscopic appearance of tracheal wash samples from horses submitted for cytological analysis. The appearance of thefluid goes from clear and transparent (left), to turbid with slight flocculation (centre), to reddish in colour (right), the latter suggesting the presence of haemorrhage. ABC Fig 2: Macroscopic and microscopic structure of the respiratory tract in the equine species. (A) Trachea and bronchi are lined cuboidal cells, anddistally by non ciliated cells. (C) Alveoli are mainly covered byType I / OCTOBER 2015These can exfoliate either individually or in cohesive sheets. They are characterised by small, round, basal nuclei,with nely granular chromatin and moderate amounts of cytoplasm. Cilia are located on the apical side of thecytoplasmic membrane, facing the lumen. Depending onthe orientation of the cell on the slide, cilia may or may notbe visible and columnar cells may appear as cuboidal(transversal section; Fig 4 ). The ability to visualise cilia may vary with the freshness of the sample, the presence orabsence of xation, and the method of staining. Standardisation of the techniques used for cytologicalpreparations and knowledge of normal features that can beseen under the conditions applied are recommended inorder to facilitate recognition of normal and abnormalfeatures. In addition, moderate numbers of macrophages, and lower numbers of small lymphocytes and neutrophils are alsonormally noted ( Table 1 ). Generally, neutrophils comprise <20% of the nucleated cell population in normal horses with good air hygiene (dust free with low concentrations of allergens, bacteria and irritants) (Bain 1997). However, in a recent American study, >70% of pleasure horses were found to have higher percentages of neutrophils ( >20%), suggesting that this cut-off value should not be used as the sole indicatorof airway in flammation (Robinson et al. 2006). Rare eosinophils ( Fig 5 ) and mast cells ( Fig 6 ) may also be noted (Sweeney et al. 1992; Bain 1997; Zinkl 2002). Tracheal washes from foals tend to have a higher relative percentage ofneutrophils, eosinophils and mast cells (Crane et al. 1989). Other observations in TWs from clinically normal horses include variable amounts of mucus (usually not abundant) and goblet cells in small numbers. Vegetable and fungal elements may be present due to inhaled naso-oropharyngealmaterial or naso-oropharyngeal contamination during bronchoscopicexamination of the lower respiratory tract or using a BAL catheter, and enables the diagnosis of disease in the distal airways and alveolar spaces. Bronchoalveolar lavage is most likely to be representative when diffuse pulmonary pathology is present. In conditions with localised, focal or multifocal distribution, BAL samples obtained from areas other than those affected may fail to detect cytological abnormalities (Piviani 2014). Sampling is usually performed after exercise because mucus can be observed more readily at this time (Hoffman 2008). Bronchoalveolar lavage is considered more sensitive and speci c than TW for detecting in flammation of the lower airways (Couetil et al. 2007). Healthy horses have been reported to have a total nucleated cell count of <300- 1000910 6cells/l, when performed using an automated analyser or manually with a haemocytometer (Bain 1997; Richard et al. 2010). The width of the interval of counts considered to be within normal limits is quite wide. Furthermore, cell counts may be signi cantly in fluenced by the volume of fluid infused and retrieved and the presence of abundant mucus may promote cell trapping that may alter the number of cells available for counting. These factors currently limit the usefulness of total nucleated cell counts in the interpretation of respiratory specimens. The standard system for the leucocyte differential count in equine BAL samples is based on counting 400 leucocytes on the slide. An alternative method in which 5 microscopic elds are evaluated at high power eld (50 9) has been proposed and seems to be more accurate for the enumeration of mast cells (Fernandez et al. 2013). Alveolar macrophages and small lymphocytes are the predominant cell types seen in BAL samples ( Fig 7 ). Neutrophils typically comprise <5% of the nucleated cells; mast cells and eosinophils are rare ( Table 1 ) (Hoffman 2008). A signi cantly higher proportion of mast cells can be obtained from low volume, rst aliquot samples; moreover mast cells appear to be more numerous in samples collected from the left lung (Sweeney et al. 1992; Jean et al. 2011). Respiratory epithelial cells are also commonly seen (Hoffman 2008). These include ciliated and nonciliated columnar cells and occasional cuboidal cells. The latter are characterised by a high nuclear: cytoplasmic ratio with small to medium sized, round and central nucleus and nely granular chromatin, and moderate amounts of cytoplasmTABLE 1: Tracheal wash and bronchoalveolar lavage differential cell count (mean /C6s.d., %) reference values in asymptomatic horses\u00a7 Cell type * Richard (2008).Not included in the differential leucocyte count.\u00a7These data have been taken from the literature and are used in the authors 'laboratory.

[Correction added on 31 July 2015, after rst online publication: In Table 2, the values for eosinophils and mast cells were transposed and the information has now been corrected to 'Possible presence of increased eosinophils 2015(Fig 4 ). Goblet cells may be seen in very small numbers. They appear as large mononuclear cells, containing frequent purple round intracytoplasmic granules ( Fig 8 ); the latter may occasionally be dispersed in the background if cells are broken or degranulated. BAL typically also contains small amounts of mucus, which appears as amorphous material in the background ( Fig 9 ). Common respiratory cytological patterns Insuf cient sample The absence of nucleated cells on a concentrated preparation from either a TW or a BAL is likely to indicate that the sample is not representative of the respiratory tract; in those cases, resampling is recommended. Moreover, if, during the evaluation of a BAL sample only columnar respiratory epithelial cells and no macrophages are noted, it is likely that the airways (trachea, bronchi, bronchioli) instead of the alveolar spaces have beensampled, and therefore the sample may not be representative. Contaminated sample Samples obtained via endoscopy may be contaminated dueto scraping of the oropharyngeal mucosa during the passage of the endoscope, which may result in the spurious presence of squamous epithelial cells, extracellular bacteria and, possibly, in flammatory cells from the 1997; oropharyngeal commensal that, when seen in cytological specimens indicates sample contamination. These bacteriatend to line up in parallel rows, giving the impression of a single large bacterium ( Fig 10 ). Oropharyngeal contamination may also interfere with the evaluation of respiratory fluid cytology. a) b) Fig 3: Tracheal wash from an asymptomatic horse.

Two eosinophils can be observed on the top right of thepicture (black arrow). Eosinophils contain characteristic Acute haemorrhage An acute haemorrhagic event is characterised by the presence of free red blood cells and may be observed during the microscopic examination of either TW or BALsamples ( Fig 11 ). Twenty-four hours after the haemorrhage, erythrocytes (erythrophagocytes)are commonly seen. Both free and phagocytosed wholeerythrocytes may be recovered in lavages up to 14 daysafter haemorrhage, with small numbers of erythrocytes still present at 21 days (McKane and Slocombe 1999). Erythrophagocytosis may also occur in vitro as a result of delayed fluid analysis or secondary to centrifugation procedures with un xed specimens, and may lead to an erroneous cytological interpretation (Rakich and Latimer 2011). The presence of erythrocytes in the fluid, together with a history of recent strenuous exercise, respiratory clinical signs, and detection of blood in the airways by endoscopic examination, is frequently associated with exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage (EIPH), a disorder reported in horses that perform strenuous exercise and recognised in Thoroughbred, Standardbred and Quarter Horse racehorses. Several techniques are available for the diagnosis of EIPH although no clinical or laboratory gold standard methods have been established. Observation of blood in respiratoryairways of horses 30 -120 min after racing or strenuous exercise remains the most acceptable method for detecting EIPH (Doucet and Viel 2002; Hinchcliff et al. 2005). Enumeration of erythrocytes in BAL has also been proposed Fig 6: Tracheal wash from a horse with in flammatory airway disease. Three granulated mast cells can be observed at thecentre of the picture (one mast cell indicated by the blackarrow).

Free red blood cells may also be encountered in TW and BAL samples in association with inhalation of blood due to haemorrhagic processes involving the respiratory tract. Spurious haemocontamination during the endoscopic procedure is another potential cause for the presence of red blood cells in the sample (Zinkl 2002), and may also be associated with the presence of platelets. Clinical history is considered crucial for the interpretation of these ndings. Chronic haemorrhage The presence of haemosiderophages (macrophages containing intracytoplasmic haemosiderin) in TW and BAL samples is indicative of chronic haemorrhage and has also been used for detection of EIPH ( Fig 12 ). This nding is reported to have a higher sensitivity compared with endoscopic airway examination for several reasons: 1) itallows the identi cation of small amounts of blood that might be missed on endoscopy; and 2) cellular evidence of prior haemorrhage persists for several weeks, making it possible to identify a previous haemorrhage up to 4 weeks after an episode of EIPH (Couetil and Hawkins 2013). The area of sampling may in fluence the amounts of haemosiderophages harvested, since, in a horse with EIPH, haemosiderin tends to accumulate in higher quantities in the caudodorsal lung regions (Derksen et al. 2009). Interestingly, previous studies showed that any horse subject to BAL procedures shows some degree of haemosiderin within macrophages, even if not affected by EIPH. However, a signi cant difference in the amount of haemosiderin observed between healthy horses and those with EIPH has been reported. When using a total haemosiderin score (THS) of 75 as a cutoff point, the THS test was found to have a sensitivity of 94% and a speci city of 88% for the detection of EIPH (Doucet and Viel 2002). Unfortunately, the calculation of the THS, which is based on the evaluation of the amounts of haemosiderin present within 300 alveolar macrophages, is a very time-consuming procedure, which makes this unlikely to be suitable for routine diagnostic use. In the literature, a cut-off point of >50% haemosiderophages for the diagnosis of EIPH has been inappropriately extrapolated from the materials and methods of the paper by Newton and Wood (2002) and has been used as a criterion for the diagnosis of EIPH.

When these are increased in numbers, a neutrophilic in flammation is present. Neutrophilic in flammation can be associated either with septic or nonseptic causes. Septic aetiologies Septic in flammation of the lower respiratory tract is frequently associated with systemic clinical signs, such as fever, depression, decreased appetite and weight loss. Thoracic imaging, haematology and biochemistry pro les usually support the presence of an in flammatory focus (Couetil et al. 2007). This clinical information should be taken into consideration during the cytological evaluation of respiratory fluids, since similar cytological ndings may be observed in horses with septic and nonseptic in flammation and their distinction may not always be possible on the basis of the cytology alone. Septic in flammation is generally characterised by marked inltration of neutrophils into the airways. The relative proportion of neutrophils seen in the TW or BAL is usually >40% and frequently close to 100% (Bain 1997). In bacterial pneumonia, neutrophils often appear degenerate, displaying swollen nuclei that partially lose their lobulation (karyolysis), with smooth and pale chromatin and may contain cytoplasmic vacuolations ( Fig 13a ). However, it is important to recognise that in vitro cell and nuclear swelling or lysis due to sample ageing in un xed specimens can lead to morphological changes that may mimic true neutrophil degeneration caused by bacterial endotoxins. In some cases, intra- and extracellular bacteria may be seen. The presence of intracytoplasmic bacteria is considered consistent with infection, whereas extracellular bacterial may re flect environmental contamination and/or infection ( Fig 13b ). The absence of bacteria on cytological examination also does not rule out infection, especially when neutrophils are the dominant cell type and the clinical ndings are supportive of a bacterial aetiology. In these cases, bacterial culture would be helpful to con rm/rule out the presence of bacterial infection (Bain 1997; Zinkl 2002). Cytology does not lead to detailed identi cation of bacterial subtypes but allows distinction between bacilli and cocci; moreover, some bacteria may have a more distinctive morphology. Rhodococcus equi , for example, is a pathogen reported as a cause of respiratory disorders in young foals, and is characterised by being an intracellular bacteria with a typical 'watermelon seeds 'shape (Zinkl 2002). Septic neutrophilic in flammation is more commonly associated with bacterial infection although acute inflammation can occur with a variety of aetiologies, including fungal, protozoal, parasitic and viral agents. Fungal infections may result in a neutrophilic in ltration, although increased numbers of eosinophils and macrophages have also been reported. Fungi may have characteristic morphological features that can yield a cytological presumptive identi cation although further tests would be required for a speci c classi cation (e.g. fungal culture, polymerase chain reaction). They are usually divided into primary pathogenic fungi (e.g. Cryptococcus spp., Blastomyces Contaminant fungi (e.g. Alternaria spp.) may also be observed and are an indicator of particulate exposure from forage and the environment (Fig 14 ). Contaminants which occur following sampling or from naso-oropharyngeal contamination are usually extracellular, but phagocytosis may occur in un xed specimens during transport or prior to cytological processing. Inhaled fungal elements and vegetable material may be intracellular or extracellular ( Fig 15 ). Infection by Pneumocystis spp. has also been described in foals and may cause pneumonia (Ainsworth et al. 1993; Ewing et al. 1994). Primary uncomplicated viral infections may occur, but most animals will have a secondary bacterial infection at the time of the examination and will present with neutrophilic inflammation. An increase in lymphocytes and some degree of epithelial cell injury have also been described (Beech 1991; Freeman et al. 1993). The latter may include margination of chromatin, ciliocytophthoria (ciliated tufts formation) and basal cell containing pyknotic nuclei and red cytoplasmic inclusions, and/or multinucleated cells (Freeman et al. 1993). a) b) Fig 13: Bronchoalveolar lavage from a dog with septic pneumonia. a) Increased percentage of neutrophils showing signs of degeneration (swollen pale nucleus with partial loss of lobulation). b) Intracytoplasmic bacteria indicative of infection(black arrow). stain, 3. \u00a92015 aetiologies Nonseptic in flammation is evidenced by the presence of inflammatory cells without any proof of an aetiological agent. Recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) and in flammatory airway disease (IAD) are common causes of poorperformance, characterised by a sterile airway neutrophilic response. Recurrent airway obstruction, formerly known as heaves or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is an in flammatory condition of the respiratory tract of mature horses characterised by excessive mucus production, neutrophil accumulation, bronchial hyperreactivity, bronchospasm, intolerance and respiratory signs (Wilkins and Woolums 2009; Pirie 2014). It is considered to be a hypersensitivity response to inhaled moulds and organic dusts contained in hay and straw, which elicit an innate and adaptive immune response (Robinson et al. 1996; Davis and Rush 2002; Pirie 2014). A variant of this disorder, called summer pasture-associated obstructive pulmonary disease (SPAOPD) has also ben reported and may develop in mature horses that are kept outdoors (Wilkins and Woolums 2009). The distinction of this disorder from RAO is mostly clinical since cytological features of BAL samples from horses with these disorders are frequently similar and overlap (Costa et al. 2000). Diagnosis can be achieved by clinical examination, endoscopic evaluation of the airways, collection of respiratory samples, and evaluation of the response to therapy. Bronchoalveolar lavage examination is considered superior to TW in terms of speci city and sensitivity for con rming the diagnosis of RAO (Pirie 2014). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from horses increased number of nondegenerate neutrophils ( >25%), with an associated reduction in macrophage and lymphocyte percentages. This may be accompanied by an increased amount of mucus and by the presence of Curschmann 's spirals (Jean et al. 2011; Pirie 2014). An increased number of eosinophils may also occasionally be observed although, inmost cases, the percentage of mast cells and eosinophils is not elevated (Wilkins and Woolums 2009). Clusters of hyperplastic ciliated epithelial cells and increased numbers of goblet cells may also be seen (Zinkl 2002).Inflammatory airway disease is a nonseptic disorder of the lower respiratory tract that can affect racehorseperformance. The use of the term IAD to de ne a less severe form of airway in flammation compared to RAO was rst proposed in 2000 and its clinical de nition was reported 2 years later at the Havemeyer workshop entitled 'Inflammatory airway disease: de ning the syndrome ' (Robinson 2003). However, it is still controversial whether IAD represents a separate disease entity to RAO or if it is part of a continuum of airway in flammation that may ultimately progress to RAO (Mazan and Hoffman 2003). Horses of any age can be affected although young racehorses (age 2 - 4 years) are over-represented (Couetil et al. 2007). Clinical signs are more frequently observed during exercise whilst the disease often remains subclinical at rest. The diagnosis of IAD is most often achieved by BAL cytology. Horses affected by IAD typically have increased numbers of total nucleated cells in the BAL compared to healthy horses. Respiratory epithelial cells are often absent. BAL obtained from horses affected by IAD is most commonlycharacterised by a mild mixed in flammation with mildly elevated numbers of neutrophils (5 -20%), lymphocytes and monocytes. In young horses, slightly increased mast cells (>2%) and eosinophils ( >0.1%) can also be observed (Couetil et al. 2007). Although the presence of a neutrophilic in flammation is not speci c for IAD, the percentage of these cells in the bronchoalveolar fluid is often used to differentiate this condition from other respiratory diseases. In particular, the neutrophilic in flammation is relatively mild in IAD, whereas in horses with RAO the percentage of neutrophils is often 25% of the nucleated cells ( Table 2 ). A cytological overlap may however be seen between horses with IAD and cases in remission from RAO. Cytological ndings should also be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical history and theendoscopic ndings for a more speci c diagnosis. This acquires even greater importance for complicated cases where multiple disorders may be present concurrently clinically, and therefore cytologically.

Eosinophilic in flammation An increased percentage of eosinophils in respiratory secretions is suggestive of hypersensitivity and can be observed in allergic bronchitis and parasitic infections. Horses can be an accidental host of Dictyocaulus arn eldi. The migration of this parasite often elicits an eosinophilic inflammatory response (MacKay and Urquhart 1979). Idiopathic disseminated eosinophilic granulomatous disease,involving the respiratory tract has also been described in the horse (Latimer et al. 1996). Tracheal wash and BAL samples from horses affected by IAD may also present with an increased percentage of eosinophils (Couetil et al. 2007). Conclusions Cytology of respiratory secretions is a useful diagnostic aid in the identi cation of respiratory tract problems in horses. An understanding of the common cellular features and basic patterns of in flammation can also provide prognostic information and provide guidance in the selection of the appropriate therapy.

Cooke Equine Reproductive Services Ltd, Old Malton, UK.Corresponding author email: cdcookevs@gmail.com Introduction Endometritis in the mare can be classed as infectious (acute or chronic) or post mating-induced endometritis (PMIE). PMIE is aphysiological inflammatory polymorphonuclear (PMNs) into theuterine lumen causing myometrial contractions and theremoval of inflammatory fluid leaving the uterus ready toaccept an embryo on Day 5.5. This process is complete at24-72 h after mating; such mares are resistant to persistentPMIE. A pathological post mating-induced endometritis isdiagnosed if the inflammation persists beyond this time andhas a negative effect on fertility; such mares are termedsusceptible to persistent PMIE (Liu and Troedsson 2008). The useof prophylactic intra-uterine antibiotics is aimed at treatingthe persistent PMIE that may arise, and their use has beencommon-place in the past, but is their routine infusion justifiedin the current age of responsible antibiotic use? Search method A literature search using PubMed, University of Liverpoolelectronic library and IVIS was performed relating to studies forintra-uterine antibiotics AND endometritis AND horse. Quantity of evidence Eleven papers were selected showing relevance to thequestion, 3 were retrospective studies (Zent et al . 1998; Morris and Allen 2002; Allen et al . 2007), 4 randomised controlled studies with one field based study (Pycock and Newcombe1996). Quality of evidence Zent et al . (1998) analysed 411 Thoroughbred mares that had routine intra-uterine antibiotic infusion post mating. Morris andAllen (2002) and Allen et al . (2007) looked at 1393 and 3373 Thoroughbred mares, respectively, during a single breedingseason assessing, amongst other things, use of post matingtreatments (antibiotics, lavage and oxytocin) the incidence ofwhich 36.4% respectively. Pycock andNewcombe (1996) was no significant difference betweengroups 2 and 3however, group 4 had an increased pregnancy rate of 72% (controls 56%). Reanalysis of this data by Brinsko(2007) showed pregnancy rates were similar between groups 2-4. None of these studies reported the use of uterine culture/cytology samples. It should be noted that there maybe commercial pressure to maximise per cycle fertilitypreventing control groups or risking over-treatment of mares.Clinical implications Zent et al . (1998) showed that only 13.7% of mares developed a persistent PMIE with older/barren mares at increased riskcompared to young/foaling/maiden mares. This is supportedby the findings of Allen et al . (2007) who also reported no significant increase in pregnancy rate between the 3 uterinetreatments and no treatment. Morris and Allen (2002) agreed,adding that there were significant differences in the proportionof mares receiving uterine treatments between the veterinarysurgeons involved but no differences in the proportion ofmares that became pregnant. Uterine treatment use washigher as expected in older mares ( >14 years) and mares returning o n 2 + occasions (Allen et al . 2007). There was a significant increase in the use of uterine treatments between1998 (Morris and Allen 2002) and 2002 (Allen et al . 2007) with an increase in pregnancy rate of 59.9% to 63.9% respectively,although in the later study National Hunt mares were includedwhich had both a higher number of matings/oestrus and anincreased use of intra-uterine antibiotic therapy; it is not clearfrom the available data what is the cause of the increasedpregnancy rate. There are potential side-effects from the use of intra-uterine antibiotics which include secondary bacterial infection(iatrogenic or by antibiotic selection), fungal infection (Liu andTroedsson 2008) or inactivation/dilution of antibiotics by uterinefluid. It is, therefore, preferable to identify persistent PMIE byultrasound examination and reduce the uterine fluid bylavage prior to infusion of antibiotics (LeBlanc and Causey2009). It is known that there are differences in the uterine inflammatory response between resistant and susceptiblemares (Woodward et al . 2013), with an increase in PMN numbers in the endometrium at 2 h and 12 h post matingcompared with resistant mares, together with different patternsof interleukin mRNA expression (IL6, IL1RN and IL10) at 6 h postmating. The PMN difference is perhaps due to degenerativechanges in the endometrium of susceptible maresand reduced myometrial activity (LeBlanc et al . 1994). Experimental models using intra-uterine bacterial infusion,which is similar to, but does not mimic, mating/insemination,have shown that resistant mares expelled intrauterine fluidwithin 48 h after bacterial challenge whereas mares withreduced myometrial contraction (clenbuterol treated)retained fluid, and of these only 40% had bacteria cultured fromthe uterine fluid suggesting that intra-uterine responses alonecan clear bacterial infection in susceptible mares and thatimpaired uterine contractility contributes to PMIE development(Nikolakopoulos and Watson 1999). It is a recurrent criticism ofresearch models that inoculation of bacteria does not mimicthe natural mating/insemination process which is a \u00a92015 EDUCATION / AE / OCTOBER 2015Clinical conclusion There has been a move towards appropriate and justifiable antibiotic use in both human and veterinary medicine. Thereare often commercial pressures to maximise pregnancy ratesfrom owners by any means, thus contributing to the potentialover-treatment of mares post mating. From the evidenceavailable the use of routine post mating antibiotics cannotbe justified even though they do not have a negative effectof pregnancy rates. However, their use in susceptible maresis appropriate, and the challenge is to identify these mares byclinical examination. Early intervention (12-24 h post mating)with uterine lavage and ecbolics is recommended andany antibiotic use should ideally be guided by uterineculture/cytology (Riddle et al . 2007) and ultrasound/clinical findings. Such an approach may necessitate a change to theroutine stud/veterinary protocol. Future studies to reliablyidentify susceptible mares prior to mating will assist in targetedand appropriate treatment being initiated in advance of thedevelopment of persistent PMIE.
