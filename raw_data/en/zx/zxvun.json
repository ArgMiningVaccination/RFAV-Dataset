It is a freehold trustee temple and its front face is under conservation by the Singapore government. The rooftop of the temple houses a Guanyin statue, which serves as a significant landm ark in Geylang. Established around 1902, the temple has a rich history of more than a century. Founder Madam Qiu Yuan Geng had inherited a villa from her uncle, a rich China merchant, which she subsequently converted into a private taoist monastery, reser ved for close friends and family. As such, the temple is independent and not affiliated to any temples in Asia. Madam Qiu was a Taoist nun who ran the monastery using Hokkien as the main dialect. Madam Khoo, the successor and also the adopted daughter of Madam Qiu, permanently converted the religion of the temple from Taoism to Buddhism during her tenure. She also continued the traditions of being a nun and adopted the current owner, Mrs Chew. In 1989, a huge fire broke out in Geylang and burnt down the m ain building of the temple. The temple was rebuilt using the generous donations from close friends, family and members of the temple. It was successfully rebuilt and reopened for worship by 1993. The 1989 fire was a pivotal event for the temple as it had l ed to Mrs Chew breaking the long -term tradition of being a nun. She got married to one of the members who actively helped the rebuilding process of the temple. The temple is now run as a family business and is open to the public. Currently, it boasts more than 500 regular members worshipping at the temple. Layout After the rebuilt of the temple, Chong Tuck Tong temple consists of three main rooms - Main Temple Hall, Secondary Temple Hall and The Ancestral Hall as shown on the right. In the main hall, it contains three different altars with the three main gods in the center of the hall. While in the Secondary god, it consists of one main god. Lastly, in the Ancestral Hall, it contains ancestral tablets of love ones from the friends and members of the hall . 3 | P a g e Gods In Chong Tuck Tong Temple, they provide worship to various gods. The 3 main gods of the temple are placed in the middle altar of the main hall - Shakyamuni Buddha, Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva and Amitabha. Together with the main altar, there is a right altar where it consists of the Medicine Buddha, Manjushri, Samantabhadra and the left altar where it consists of the Goddess of Mercy. In the secondary hall, it consists of the secondary god of the temple - Goddess of Mercy together with several other gods and her disciples. Shakyamuni Buddha Shakyamuni Buddha ( ) also known as Gautama Buddha was an ascetic and sage on whose teachings of Buddhism was founded. He is believed to be the founder in Buddhism and serves as an enlightened teacher for many Buddhists. Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva ( ) is one of the four principal bodhisattvas in East Asian Mahayana Buddhism. He is known for his vow to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the six worlds between the d eath of Gautama Buddha and the rise of Maitreya, as well as his vow not to achieve Buddhahood until all hells are emptied. Therefore, he is often regarded as the bodhisattva of hell -beings, as well as the guardian of children and patron deity of deceased c hildren. Amitabha Amitabha ( ) also known as Amida is a celestial buddha according to the scriptures of Mahayana Buddhism. He is the principal buddha in Pure Land Buddhism, a branch of East Asian Buddhism.

Manjushri is depicted as a male bodhisattva wielding a flaming sword in his right hand, representing the realization of transcendent wisdom which cuts down ignora nce and duality. He is often depicted as riding on a blue lion, or sitting on the skin of a lion which represents the use of wisdom to tame the mind, which is compared to riding or subduing a ferocious lion. He is also often paired with Samantabhadra. Samantabhadra Samantabhadra ( ) is one of the four principal bodhisattvas in East Asian Mahayana Buddhism. Samantabhadra is sometimes depicted with feminine characteristics, riding an elephant with six pairs of tusks while carrying a lotus leaf, bearing similar dress and features to some feminine depictions of Guanyin. She is also associated with practice and meditation and is often paired with Manjushri. Goddess of Mercy Goddess of Mercy ( ) also k nown as Guanyin is an East Asian bodhisattva associated with compassion as venerated by Mahayana Buddhists. She is usually depicted as a young woman donned in a flowing white robe and usually wearing necklaces symb olic of Indian or Chinese royalty.

She is often referred to as the most widely beloved Buddhist Divinity with mira culous powers to assist all those who pray to her. Legends has it that Goddess of Mercy is also called \"The One With A Thousand Arms and Thousand eyes\" where she is described as superior to all Gods and Buddhas of the Indian pantheon. It is also said that she has two prominent disciples by her side known as Shan Cai Tong Zi ( ) and Long Nu ( ). Events Hungry ghost festival This festival takes place on the 7th month according to the Chinese lunar calendar. It is a festival for ghosts where it is believed that ghosts from the underworld roam the living world when the gates of netherworld open. These ghosts are called hungry because they are stuck in th e middle of the spiritual realm and the living world and thus are not able to eat or drink. As such, during this festive period, large amounts of food are cooked to feed these ghosts. However, in order to feed the ghosts, monks will have to chant in order o pen the throats of the hungry ghost as these ghosts have pin like throats. Buddhist religious ceremony Fa Hui ( ), is a Buddhist religious assembly that usually involves chanting to the gods as a ritual. This is ritual is about thanking the Gods for bles sing these individuals with the health and wealth they received throughout the year. There will be some people who will take time to head down to the temple to donate some food for the deceased. After which , the priest will further throw coins and food such as desserts, fruits and candy to the crowd who would like to keep it for good fortune and eat it. 5 | P a g e Laughing Buddha Mi Le Fo ( ), also known as the Laughing Buddha or Happy Buddha. Mi Le Fo is known to bring happiness, hope and brightness to mankind. Mi Le Fo's birthday falls on the eve of the lunar new year ( ). Medicine God The Medicine God is known to have 4 birthday which falls consecutively on the 11th month of the lunar calendar, 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th ( ). During these 4 days, the temple will celebrate for 4 consecutive days. Guanyin The Goddess of Mercy, Guanyin, is known to have 3 birthdays: 2nd month and 19th day ( ), 6th month and 19th day ( ), 9th month and 19th day ( ) of the Lunar calendar. These three day sy mbolized the days when she turned into a nun, gain enlightenment and passed on respectively. For all the birthdays of these Gods, the temple usually holds ceremonies to celebrate their respective birthdays by cooking large amounts of food and dive into lo ng hours of meditation. Interesting Stories An interesting story we learnt from the temple are about baby milk bottle incidents. Mothers whose profession is usually a sex worker who suffered a miscarriage, or an abortion will come to the temple to pray for their children who died before being conceived. Every year, the temple will prepare hundreds of milk bottles from the mothers who came to ask for prayer. Additionally, sometimes during hungry ghost festival, the nipple of the milk bottle will be crushed (r efer to Annex A) as if a child or baby has sucked on the milk bottle. The 4th generation son, Allen, claimed he first hand experienced seeing the milk bottle tips being crushed. Furthermore, during the hungry ghost festival, Allen (the 4th generation son) mentioned that there was one night where they heard children crying in the temple and Allen said that one of the reasons could be that the mothers of these unconceived children did not come back to ask for prayer this year and hence the children who came had no food to eat. As such, allen said the temple put some food on the floor and not the table such that the food would be within the children's reach. Artifacts After walking and exploring the Chong Tuck Tong Temple, our groups have found several interesting artifacts and items and got to slightly know more about after the explanation by the owner of the temples. Censers Censers (refer to Annex B) , or commonly k nown by the Chinese as Xiang Lu ( ) are seen in the various parts of the temple, coming in different shapes and sizes. The main purpose of the censers is to hold the joss sticks that the prayers have to offer to the gods in from of them. The act of burnin g the joss sticks have different meanings to different people. One of the reasons heard from the worshippers is that the smoke coming out of the joss sticks is the soul link between the worshipper and buddha, making sure 6 | P a g e that all your prayers are heard. Member's Board Temple will usually have a stoneplate in it to explain to the public about the history of the temple, where information like background stories and important dates can all be found crafted on it. The present temple we visited also do have s uch plate, but crafted on a gold aluminium plate instead (refer to Annex C). Also, the plates have crafted name of the donors and the amount that they have offered to the temple. The 2 pagodas (refer to Annex D) that is in the middle of the temple, are als o meant to place the name of the donor who have contributed to the temple. Donation Box There are currently 3 different donation boxes (refer to Annex E) that are placed around the temple. All donation box will have something on top of it, be it the st atue of a god, or a censer. Similarly we have realised that all of these boxes have something in common, which is the chinese characters \"Guang Zhong Fu Tian\" ( ) written on it. We have done some research and it actually meant that you plant the blessin gs, you share the blessing, the poor will get the blessings and the receiver will pass on the blessings. Also, you share your blessings regardless of the receiver, whether they are rich or poor, and every single blessings counts. The donation received will go the temple's daily needs and also for their charitable acts to the public. Divination Box/Lots There are also divination box (refer to Annex F) which are placed in the temple, near the donation box. The procedures of the the divination goes like th is, the worshippers will first hold the container with a number of divination lots being placed in it, then the worshippers will pray towards the god asking about one matter that they are concern about, for e.g: Health. Once done, the worshippers will star t shaking the container until one of the lot dropped out, and according to the numbers/characters on the lot, the worshipper will proceed to the box to look for the relevant drawers where they will find a paper that contains the \"answers\" to their concerns . Singing Bowl Set In front of the main gods, there was a set of singing bowl being placed which the main purpose is for the monks to perform the necessary rituals held on events which (refer to Annex G) were mentioned previously. Burners Compared to the traditional burners in the larger temples, we realized the burner (refer to Annex H) of the present temple is much modern. The purpose of the burner in the temple is for the worshippers to burn the paper offering which they brought to o ffer to whomever they are praying to, for which they will receive it in the underworld, which the Chinese believe that there must be life in equivalent in another world after death. The idea of burning the offerings is sort of \" dematerializing \" the objects so that they can \"materialize \" it in the other world and use them. 7 | P a g e Appendices Annex A - Milk bottle nipples crushed Annex B - Censers in the temple Annex C - Aluminium plates on the side of the temple Annex D - Pagoda containing donor's name 8 | P a g e Annex E - Donation Box seen around the temple Annex F - Divination Box with the Lots being placed on top Annex G - Singing Bowl set placed in front of the main gods 9 | P a g e Annex H -Burners being placed right at the entrance from the secondary hall "}
