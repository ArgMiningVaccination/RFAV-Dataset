Return to Top Section A: Dual Credit Overview A.1) What is dual credit? Dual credit is a system in which an eligible high school student successfully completes a college course(s) that is paired to a high school course required for graduation and receives credit for the course on both the college and the high school transcripts (TEC \u00a728.009 ). A.2) What are the different types of dual credit courses a student can take? Types of Dual Credit Course s Core A cademic Courses Core a cademic courses are general education courses required for any student who plans to pursue a traditional associate or baccalaureate degree in Texas. Dual Credit c ore academic credit s earned at public institutions of higher education are transferable to Texas public colleges and universities and may be applicable to a student's Associate of Arts (AA) or Associate of Science (AS), and baccalaureate degrees. See the Texas General Education Core Curriculum WebCenter for more information. Career & Technical Education Courses Career and technical education courses award credit that appli es toward a certificate and/or Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree program and are intended to prepare students for immediate employment in a specific occupation. Students who successfully complete these courses will graduate high school with career and technical knowledge and skills and potentially an industry certification approving them for employment in their career of choice. In limited circumstances, some of these courses will also transfer toward four year degrees. These courses must meet TSI requirements unless the courses lead to a Level 1 certificate. Foreign Language Foreign language course credit s earned at public institutions of higher education are transferable to Texas public colleges and universities and may be applicable Revised October 2019 Page | 5 to a student's Associate of Arts (AA) or Associate of Science (AS) , and baccalaureate degrees. A.3) How will a student benefit from participatin g in a dual credit program? Student s will receive college credit and high school credit simultaneously. Student s can graduate from high school with transferable college credits. Students can fast track their undergraduate or workforce degrees. Student may save on tuit ion and fees by reducing the time to complete a degree. Students will have access to a full range of college student support services while in high school to aid them in a smooth transition to college after graduation. A.4) Are districts required to offer dual credit to students? No, Texas Education Code (TEC) \u00a728.009 requires the following: Each school district shall implement a program under which students may earn the equivalent of at least 12 semester credit hours of college credit in high school. Each school district shall annually report to the agency : (1) the number of district students, including career and technical students, who have participate d in the program and earned college credit; and (2) the cumulative number of courses in which participating district students have enrolled and college credit hours the students have earned. The opportunity for students to earn at least 12 college credit hours can be met through one or a combination of the following programs: dual credit, Advanced Placement\u00ae, International Baccalaureate, articulated credit, and advanced technical credit courses. A.5) How does a school establish a dual credit program? A clearly defined partnership agreement between the high school district and the institution of higher education (IHE) is necessary to implement a dual credit program. A written agreement (often referred to as an interlocal agreement, an institutional agreement, or a memorandum of understanding) must be drawn up. The written agreement must define the nature of this collaboration (TEC \u00a728. 009). Please see Question A.10 for more information on the written agreement requirements. A.6) Can a school district enter into a dual credit partnership with any institution of higher education? It depends on the institution 's accrediting ; TAC 74.25 states that a school district may adopt a policy that allows a student to be awarded credit toward high school graduation for completing a course provided by an institution of higher education that is accredited by one of the following regional accrediting associations: (1) Southern Association of Colle ges and Schools ; (2) Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools ; (3) New England Associating of Schools and Colleges ; (4) North Central Association of Colleges and Schools ; (5) Western Association of Schools and Colleges ; or (6) Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges . A.7) Can a district limit the number of dual credit courses in which a student may enroll? Revised October 2019 Page | 6 No, House Bill (HB) 505 prohibit s limit ing the number of dual credit courses or hours in which a student may enroll while in high school and the number of dual credit courses in which a high school student may enroll during a single semester or academic year ( TEC \u00a728.009 ). A.8) Must every individual student expectation in the T exas Essential Knowledge and S kills (TEKS) be specifically taught in a college course for dual credit? No, the student expectations in the T EKS describe a level of knowledge and skill that is expected of a student upon completion of that high school course. The course for which college credit is awarded must provide advanced academic instruction beyond, or in greater depth than, the essential knowledge and skills for the equivalent high school course (TEC 74.25 (b) ). A.9) How can a student be assured that his/her dual credit class will be rigorous? The college is required by law to ensure a dual credit course and the corresponding course offered at the main campus of the college are equivalent with respect to the curriculum, materials, instruction, and method/rigor of student evaluation. These standards must be upheld regardless of th e student composition of the class (TAC \u00a74.85 (e), (f), (g) ). A.10) What are the requirements for a dual credit partnership agreement ? Texas Administrative Code rules \u00a74.84 and \u00a79.144 , require that any dual credit partnership between a secondary school and a public college include a written agreement approved by the governing boards or designated authorities of both institution s which must be posted each year to their respective websites. All dual credit agreements must address the following elements: (1) Eligible Courses (2) Student Eligibility (3) Location of Class (4) Student Composition of Class (5) Faculty Select ion, Supervision, and Evaluation (6) Course Curriculum, Instruction, and Grading (7) Academic Policies and Student Support Services (8) Transcripting of Credit (9) Funding (10) Defined sequences of courses, where applicable Additions resulting from the 2019 86th legislative session : Establish common advising strategies and terminology; Provide for the alignment of endorsements described by \u00a7 28.025(c 1); Identify tools to assist school counselors, students, and families in selecting endorsements; Use free or low cost open educational resources when possible . For more information, see House Bill 1638 Statewide Dual Credit Goals and TEC \u00a728.009 . A.11) What are the differences between dual credit , Advanced Placement \u00ae and dual enrollment ? Program Differences Defined Revised October 2019 Page | 7 Advanced Placement (AP) Allows high school students to participate in an AP course and earn college credit with successful performance on the course AP exam. Postsecondary institutions accept AP exam scores as college credit if the student meets the exam score requirements established by the institution. At a T exas college or university , an AP exam score of 3 will be awarded credit . The amount of credit and the course for which credit is awarded is determined by the college or university and can be found on their websites. Dual Credit Allows high school students to participate in a college course to earn college credit with high school credit earned simultaneously. Dual Enrollment Allows high school students to take a high school course and a college course to earn both high school credit and college credit for the course. High school credit is awarded for the successful completion of the high school portion , demonstrating mastery of the TEKS. University credit is awarded if student passes the college portion of the course. A student may decline the college grade if the student considers his/her performance to be unsatisfactory. A.12) What is Texas OnRamps Dual Enrollment program? Distinctly different from dual credit, the OnRamps student receives instruction in two separate courses from two separate instructors \u2014a high school teacher and a university faculty member. The student receives a high school grade and a college grade, as we ll as ongoing feedback and support throughout the course. Students must meet prerequisites for the college course ; however, a TSIA qualifying score is not required for participation in OnRamps . OnRamps is an example of a dual enrollment program. For more i nformation visit: https://onramps.utexas.edu/ Return to Top Section B: Student Requirements B.1) W ho is eligible to enroll in dual credit courses? High school students in the ninth through twelfth grade s who meet TSI (Texas Success Initiative) or dual credit eligibility requirements may enroll in dual credit courses . See Question B. 6 for requirements. B.2) Must dual credit students show proof of bacterial meningitis for enrollment? Yes and no ; a dual credit student attending classes on a college campus is required to provide proof of bacterial meningitis vaccination. However, d ual credit students who are taking their courses on a high school campus only or online are not required to show proof of bacterial meningitis vaccination. B.3) Are students covered under the special education umbrella eligible to take dual credit courses? Yes, s tudents are eligible for dual credit courses as long as they meet the requirements specified in Chapter \u00a74.85(b) . Revised October 2019 Page | 8 B.4) When enrolled in a dual credit course, should the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) be considered when serving students with disabilities? While public school districts and open e nrollment charter schools are bound by the rules and requirements under the IDEA, Institutions of Higher Education (IHE) are not. IHEs are bound by the rules and requirements under the ADA which does not include required implementation of a student's Indiv idual Education Plan (IEP). Under the ADA, accommodations for students may include an adaptation of the way specific courses are conducted, however modifications to course requirements a nd/or content are not required. B.5) If a student has a diagnosed dis ability and is enrolled in dual credit courses at a college, how does the student find out if he/she is eligible for services through the institution of higher education's Disability Services Office? Dual credit students with a diagnosed disability who ar e requesting accommodations must provide documentation of disability to the institution of higher education 's Disability Services Office (DSO) to determine eligibility for services. Eligibility for services at the high school does not always ensure that st udents will meet the criteria to receive accommodations in a college credit course. B.6) What are the requirements to enroll in dual credit courses ? Chapter \u00a74.85(b) identifies the requirements that must be met by each student who enrolls in a college course for dual credit. House Bill (HB) 505 , 84th Texas Legislature, 2015, prohibited any administrative rules that limit the grade levels at which a high school student may be eligible to enroll in a dual credit course. This change became effective with the start of the 2015 2016 school year. Requirements for enrollment are provided in the chart below. Colleges and/or high schools may impose additional eligibility requirements if they do not conflict with state dual credit regulations. See chart on next page.

Dual credit teachers must be regularly employed faculty members of the college or must meet the same standards, including minimal requirements of the regional accrediting association (listed in A.6 ), and approval procedur es used by the college to select faculty responsible for teaching the same courses to nonhigh school students at the college (TAC \u00a74.85 (e) ). C.2) What certifications must a teacher have to teach a course for dual credit? When districts partner with community colleges and universities to offer dual credit courses , the college faculty must meet teacher certification requirements that are set by the regional accrediting association (listed in A.6) and the community college and university . College faculty teaching dual credit courses are not required to obta in certification through the State Board for Educator Certification . C.3) Are college faculty who teach courses for dual credit subject to fingerprinting requirements under T exas Education Code \u00a722.0834, Criminal History Record Information Review of Cert ain Contract Employees? Local school districts determine their own policies regarding criminal history requirements for contract employees, subject to minimum standards of TEC \u00a722.083 4 which requires criminal history reviews of contract employees who have direct contact with students. TAC \u00a7153.1101 provide s some guidance as to the minimum requirements of TEC \u00a722.0834. Pursuant to those rules, school districts should consider whether contract employees have the opportunity for unsupervised contact with students , if they do, fingerprinting and a review of criminal history records with be conducted. Section D: Course Requirements D.1) Can high school credit be awarded for any college course? No, it is the responsibility of the institutions entering a dual credit partnership to ensure the following requirements are met to award high schoo l credit for successful completion of a college course . Courses offered for dual credit by public, twoyear, associatedegreegranting institutions must be identified as collegelevel academic courses in the current edition of the THECB's Lower Division Academic Course Guide Manual (ACGM) or as collegelevel technical education courses in the current edition of the board's Workforce Education Course Manual (WECM) . Courses offered for dual credit by public universities must be in the approved undergraduate core course inventory of th at university. Public institutions of higher education may not offer remedial or developmental courses for dual credit. Courses offered for dual credit must provide instruction that ensures mastery of the TEKS for the appropriate high school course and go beyond or into greater depth than the TEKS (TAC \u00a74.85 ). D.2) What courses are available to take for dual credit? Courses offered for dual credit by public institutions of higher education must be contained in the core curriculum of the institution providing the credit, career and t echnical education courses, or foreign language courses (TAC \u00a74.85 ). Dual credit courses that are completed as part of an approved early college education program under TEC 29.908 or as part of an early college program defined in TAC Chapter 4, Subchapter D, must be identified as collegelevel academic courses in the current edition of the THECB's Lower Division Academic Course Guide Manual (ACGM) , as collegelevel technical education courses in the current edition of the board's Workforce Education Course Manual (WECM) , or in a university's approved undergraduate core course s. Public colleges may not offer remedial or developmental courses for du al credit . Revised October 2019 Page | 11 Return to Top D.3) Who is responsible for the content of a course offered for dual credit? Because the course is a college course, the college is responsible for the content. However, because the high school is also awarding high school credit, the public school district is responsible for ensuring student s have an opportunity to demonstrate master y of the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) . The district may review the course syllabus as it is taught at the partner ing institution. If it is determined that all the TEKS are not demonstrated or exceeded in the course, the district may work with the institution of higher education (IHE) to enhance the course and/or provide supplemental instruct ion. D.4) What is a course equivalency crosswalk (also referred to as an articulation chart)? A course equivalency crosswalk is an officially approved document that matches course s between schools and institutions or establishes procedures for reviewing c ourses that may be offered for dual credit. The course equivalency crosswalk should be part of the written agreement between the district and the institution . Please see Question A.10 for more information on requirements of written agreements. D.5) Where are courses for dual credit taught? Courses for dual credit may be taught on the college campus, on the high school campus, on a satellite campus, or online. D.6) Can one -semester co llege courses be offered over two semesters to accommodate the high school schedule? Colleges are responsible for determining the length of their courses . However, they should work with ISDs to adopt a more flexible schedule that works best for the student . D.7) How many college courses for dual credit may a student take? Starting with the 2015 2016 school year, HB 505 prohibited any rules that limit the number of dual cred it courses in which a student may enroll while in high school or the number of dual credit courses or hours in which a student may enroll each semester or academic year . The school district and institution of higher education MOU may not limit the number of dual credit courses in which a high school student may enroll. The MOU for the high school and the college should appear on the ir websites. Section E: Credits and Gra des E.1) Who is responsible for determining what credit(s) are earned by the student? The college is responsible for the college course materials and awards the college credit upon successful completion of the dual cr edit course. The high school is respons ible for determining the specific high school credit that will be awarded for the college course. The high school and college are encouraged to work together to determine appropriate high school credit to be awarded upon successful completion of the course (TAC \u00a774.26 ). Return to Top Revised October 2019 Page | 12 E.2) Who awards grades in courses for dual credit? Grades are assigned by the instructor of record. The instructor of record mu st be authorized and credentialed by the institution of higher education (IHE) to teach the cours e. The IHE will award a letter grade . The high school will award a numerical equivalent to the letter grade. An appropriat e grading scale should be established and included in the written agreement. The method of providing the grade to the high school must also be included in the articulation agreement. Please see Question A.10 for more information on requirements of written agreements. E.3) Are grades in courses for dual credit weighted when calculating the student's high school grade point average (GPA)? All grading decisions, including those affecting GPA, are made per local school board policy. E.4) Will the grades a student receives in a dual credit course appear on the high school transcript? Students will receive a letter grade from the college. A c orresponding numeric grade will be given by the high school. Grades will appear on both the student 's high school and college transcripts . E.5) What happens if a student earns a F in a dual credit class? If a student earns an F in a dual credit course, he/she will not receive high school or college credit for the course , but the grade will be documented as an F on the college transcript . The grade typically appears on the high school transcript if it appears in the studen t's high school schedule. The district has final decision. E.6) How many grades are issued in a dual credit course? The number of grades issued in a dual credit course is the decision of the teacher of record, typically, the college instructor. The number of grades issued can range between a minimum of 2, mid term and final grade , and a n unlimited maximum for the 15 week course. E.7) Will students in courses for dual credit be required to take the end- of-course (EOC) assessments? Yes, students enrolled in dual credit courses are required to take the corresponding EOC assessment if the dual credit course is substituting for a course that requires an EOC assessment . Return to Top Section F: Award of College Credit F.1) When does a college transcript the credits earned by a student? College credit , as well as high school credit , should be transcripted immediately upon a student's completion of the course ( TAC \u00a74.85(h )). F.2) How do different types of dual credit s transfer? Academic dual credits may be applied toward the core curriculum or to other specific degree program requirements o f an academic associate degree or baccalaureate degree at a Texas public IHE . Due to their specialized nature, c areer and technical dual credit courses m ay have limited transferability outside an applied science associate 's or bachelor's degree. Some public institutions may award elective credit instead. A limited number of private or outofstate institutions may choose to award transfer credit for dual credit academic courses . Student s who want more information about how their courses for dual credit might transfer should seek specific transfer guidance from an advisor at the institution offering the course (TAC \u00a774.26 ). Revised October 2019 Page | 13 F.3) How can students ensure the transferability of courses for dual credit? To ensure transferability of courses, students should choose academic courses that fit into the core curriculum of the institution (IHE) offering the dual credit program. Academic courses that fulfill the core curriculum are guaranteed to transfer to any other public IHE in Texas by rule (TAC \u00a74.25 ). However, these courses may not count tow ard a specific degree program or transfer to an out ofstate university. F.4) Can developmental courses at an institution of higher education ( IHE) provide dual credit? No, remedial or d evelopmental education courses cannot be offered for dual credit ( TAC 4.8 5(4)). F.5) What is the six -drop rule and does it affect dual credit students? TEC \u00a751.907 place s limitations on the number of course drops that are allowed for students in public institutions of higher education to six . However, students who are still enrolled in high school are not affected by the provisions of TEC \u00a751.907 and any course a student drops while they are still enrolled in high school should not be counted toward the limitation o f dropped courses under this section (TAC \u00a74.9 ). F.6) Are dual credit students affected by the Excess Hours Law, which makes college students subject to out - of-state tuition rates if they exceed 30 semester credit hours over their baccalaur eate degree plan? Beginning in fall 2009, semester credit hours earned by a student before graduating from high school and used to satisfy high school graduation requirements (hours earned in classes taken for dual credit) are exempted from the calculation of excess hours ( TEC \u00a761.0595 ). Return to Top Section G: Attendance Accounting G.1) D oes time spent in a college course for dual credit count toward a district's average daily attendance (ADA) even if the course meets on the college campus? Yes, the Student Attendance and Accounting Handbook explains that fundingeligible time for a student taking a course for dual credit will include time instructed in the course even if the course meets on the higher education campus. A student not actually on campus at the time attendance is taken may be considered in attendance for Foundation School Program purposes if the student is enrolled in and attending an offcampus course for dual credit. Campuses may choose an alternate attendan cetaking time for a group of students that are scheduled to be off campus during the regular attendancetaking time. Examples include dualcredit students who are attending classes at another location or career and technical education students who are sch eduled to be at a worksite. Revised October 2019 Page | 14 G.2) If a student is attending a course for dual credit at an institution of higher education (IHE) with a calendar of less than 75,600 minutes, is the student considered in attendance at his/her high school? Yes. The 75,600 minutes requirement is not based on individual students or individual courses. The minutes requirement is by campus, therefore, the hours of operation for the campus must be 75,600 minutes for funding purposes. If high school students are taking courses for dual credit at an IHE with a calendar of fewer than 75,600 minutes, the school district may apply for a waiver of the 75,600 minutes calendar requirement. Waiver requests should be sent to the TEA State Waivers Unit . In instances in which an IHE's calendar is shorter than the school district's calendar, the district should report the student's attendance in the Public Education Informatio n Management System (PEIMS) with a different track to reflect the shorter calendar. Reporting the student with a separate track will prevent any reduction in state funding. Some districts choose to use the days when the high school meets but the IHE does n ot (ie., at the beginning or end of a semester to provide instruction in the TEKS not demonstrated in the college course. This allows them to meet attendance requirements while also meeting course content requirements. G.3) Where can I find more informat ion about attendance calculations in Career and Technical Education (CTE) courses for dual credit? Please see Section 5.11 of the Student Attendance Accounting Handbook Return to Top Section H: State Funding H.1) Who pays the c ost of dual credit courses? Students are often required to pay for tuition, books, and fees related to dual credit, though sometimes the college waives or reduces these costs, or the high school pays the costs. A detailed description of costs and who will be responsible for them should be included in the written agreement (MOU) between the school district and the institution of higher education ( IHE).
