While licensed vaccines are now available for EBOV, vaccine candidates for SUDV and MARV are all in preclinical or early clinical development phases. During the recent outbreak of SUDV virus disease, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), as part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, implemented key actions with our existing partners to advance preparedness and enable rapid response to the outbreak, while also aligning with global partners involved in the implementation of clinical trials in an outbreak setting. Beyond pre-existing plans prior to the outbreak, BARDA worked with product sponsors to expedite manufacturing of vaccine doses that could be utilized in clinical trials. While the SUDV outbreak has since ended, a new outbreak of MARV disease has emerged. It remains critical that we continue to advance a portfolio of vaccines against SUDV and MARV while also expediting manufacturing activities ahead of, or in parallel if needed, outbreaks.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-06-19", "cleaned_text": "Developing Vaccines to Improve Preparedness for Filovirus Outbreaks: The Perspective of the USA Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11061120](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11061120) [Recent Scientific Advances in Vaccination against Ebola Virus Diseases]( /journal/vaccines/special_issues/41792O6ID7 )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-11-01120)]. Biological threats, whether naturally occurring or intentionally engineered, pose serious threats for which we must be prepared. Vaccines are and can be a major component of response efforts for public health emergencies like smallpox, anthrax, and viral hemorrhagic fevers. Hemorrhagic fever viruses, including filoviruses, are a priority threat addressed within BARDA's current portfolio of vaccine development investments. [2](#B2-vaccines-11-01120)]. Ebolavirus is further subdivided into six species, namely, Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Bundibugyo virus, Tai Forest virus, Reston and Bombali virus [ [3](#B3-vaccines-11-01120)]. EBOV, SUDV, and MARV infections cause sever viral infection with case fatality rates of up to 90% in humans, with death often occurring within 4-10 days post infection [ [4](#B4-vaccines-11-01120)]. Recent and reoccurring outbreaks of EBOV, SUDV, and MARV, discussed further below, highlight the continued threat of filoviruses to global public health and national security, particularly for SUDV and MARV, where currently, no licensed vaccines or therapeutics are available. 2. Ebola Virus 2.1. Ebola Virus Outbreaks [5](#B5-vaccines-11-01120)]. Particularly challenging to the outbreak were the weakened healthcare systems in the affected countries, as well as cultural and social factors that made it difficult to implement effective public health measures. In years since, there have been multiple smaller outbreaks of EBOV, predominantly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) [ [3](#B3-vaccines-11-01120)]. With lessons learned in public health responses along with licensed vaccines and therapeutics to prevent and treat EBOV, respectively, these smaller outbreaks were resolved quickly and did not grow to the magnitude of the 2014-2016 outbreak. 2.2. Ebola Virus Vaccine Development and Licensure [6](#B6-vaccines-11-01120)] and the European Medicines Authority (EMA) [ [7](#B7-vaccines-11-01120)]. ERVEBO is based on the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) expressing the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) and is indicated for adults 18 years or older for protection against EBOV. Data from the ring vaccination trial in Guinea indicated a rapid onset of protection, as no cases were reported 10 days after a single dose of vaccine [ [8](#B8-vaccines-11-01120)]. The duration of protection with a single-dose regimen of ERVEBO is unclear, and there is currently no defined correlate of protection. However, data from a clinical study showed that the immune response elicited from vaccination with rVSVG-ZEBOV-GP was robust and remained elevated at 24 months [ [9](#B9-vaccines-11-01120)]. ERVEBO does not protect against other species of Ebola virus or Marburg virus, thus necessitating vaccine development for other filovirus species. [10](#B10-vaccines-11-01120)]. The Zabdeno component of the vaccine is based on the adenovirus 26 virus expressing a recombinant EBOV glycoprotein in place of the replication-essential adenovirus early 1 region, while the Mvabea component is based on the modified Vaccina Ankara virus (MVA) expressing the glycoproteins of EBOV, SUDV, MARV, and the Tai Forest virus nucleoprotein [ [11](#B11-vaccines-11-01120)]. The Zbedeo/Mvabea regimen consists of Zabdeno administered first, followed by Mvabea given approximately eight weeks later, and is currently indicated by the EMA for active immunization for the prevention of EBOV for people greater than one year of age [ [10](#B10-vaccines-11-01120)]. While the vaccine regimen elicits a robust immune response, its efficacy in preventing EVD has not been measured in humans, and the two-dose regimen administration presents difficulties in outbreak conditions. 2.3. Ebola Virus Vaccine Stockpiling and Preparedness [12](#B12-vaccines-11-01120)]. Stockpiling will allow for the rapid deployment of ERVEBO in outbreak situations and prevent delays associated with supply chains and the necessary time for manufacturing and meeting regulatory requirements. The global EBOV stockpile had already proven its utility when 7370 doses of ERVEBO were deployed in response to EBOV outbreaks in DRC [ [13](#B13-vaccines-11-01120)]. The availability of a licensed vaccine has been a monumental step forward. However, it should be noted that partnerships with affected countries are critical to the last mile of distribution and administration to ensure the vaccine can be appropriately received and utilized. ERVEBO is not expected to protect against filoviruses other than EBOV. Therefore, it will be important to include investigational doses and, when available, licensed vaccines for other filoviruses such as SUDV and MARV in vaccine stockpiles for optimal preparedness. 3. Sudan Virus 3.1. Sudan Virus Outbreaks [14](#B14-vaccines-11-01120)]. The largest recorded SUDV outbreak occurred in 2000-2001 in the Gulu, Mbarara, and Masindi districts of Uganda and caused 425 cases and 224 deaths. More recently, a SUDV outbreak started in August 2022 in the Mubende District of western Uganda and was declared over on 11 January 2023, after 142 confirmed cases (22 probable) and 55 deaths were recorded [ [15](#B15-vaccines-11-01120)]. Prior to the 2022 outbreak, seven outbreaks of SUDV were recorded with the last one occurring in 2012. Since there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for SUDV, outbreaks have an increased potential to spread beyond their point of origin and their control relies only on classical control measures, such as case identification and isolation, contact tracing, safe burials, and community sensitization about transmission risks. 3.2. 2022 Sudan Virus Response and Vaccine Pipeline [16](#B16-vaccines-11-01120)]. These immediate response efforts were critical to identifying new cases and preventing transmission of SUDV, especially in the absence of licensed vaccines and therapeutics. [17](#B17-vaccines-11-01120)]. Fortunately, public health measures were effective in controlling the outbreak before the ring vaccination protocol could be implemented, and as a result, the ring vaccinations did not occur. The following sections highlight the vaccines in development against SUDV and measures taken to improve our preparedness posture for SUDV outbreaks. [18](#B18-vaccines-11-01120)]. The lack of available cGMP doses of the VSV-SUDV vaccine was a key bottleneck at the outset of the outbreak. Fortunately, a bulk drug substance that could be quickly filled into final drug product was available from Merck through a previous program [ [19](#B19-vaccines-11-01120)]. In parallel to this near-term supply of clinical trial material, BARDA continued to support the program with financial resources and technical CMC consulting for a long-term supply of doses. The other key technical gap for the VSV-SUDV program was the lack of phase 1 clinical data. BARDA quickly extended the agreement with IAVI to support phase 1 clinical trials. [20](#B20-vaccines-11-01120), [21](#B21-vaccines-11-01120)]. While clinical and nonclinical data suggest a safe and immunogenic vaccine that was protective in an NHP model, there were only about 100 doses of cGMP ChAd3-SUDV vaccine belonging to the Vaccine Research Center that were available at the onset of the outbreak [ [22](#B22-vaccines-11-01120)]. BARDA, therefore, worked with Sabin to produce an additional 10,000 doses that could be utilized in clinical trials and provide an interim level of preparedness [ [23](#B23-vaccines-11-01120)]. In parallel, BARDA entered into a new agreement with Sabin to further evaluate the manufacturing process of ChAd3-SUDV while generating additional clinical trial material [ [24](#B24-vaccines-11-01120)]. [25](#B25-vaccines-11-01120)] and an additional phase I study is currently underway in Tanzania [ [26](#B26-vaccines-11-01120)]. However, at the time of the 2022 SUDV outbreak, nonhuman primate efficacy data had not been generated. [17](#B17-vaccines-11-01120)]. IAVI and Merck's VSV-SUDV was prioritized because it was deemed acceptable to extrapolate the safety and efficacy of VSV-SUDV from the ERVEBO safety and efficacy because of the only difference being the GP insert. Additionally, there was confidence that the ease of manufacturing the vaccine, as well as yields, would make this product affordable. [17](#B17-vaccines-11-01120)]. [17](#B17-vaccines-11-01120)]. [27](#B27-vaccines-11-01120)]. Approximately 2160 doses of the VSV-SUDV were received by a WHO delegation in Uganda, just 80 days after declaration of the outbreak, and held for a potential outbreak ring vaccination trial [ [27](#B27-vaccines-11-01120)]. The Sabin Vaccine Institute, with support from BARDA, expedited production of their ChAd3-SUDV candidate. On 8 December 2022, 79 days after the outbreak was declared, the first cGMP doses of the ChAd3-SUDV vaccine arrived in Uganda [ [28](#B28-vaccines-11-01120)]. Oxford expedited the manufacture of 40,000 cGMP doses of its ChAdOx1-biEbOV vaccine candidate with its CMO Serum Institute of India and delivered the first batch of doses to Uganda 80 days after the outbreak was declared [ [29](#B29-vaccines-11-01120)]. While these timelines were fast, having vaccine filled into vials will enable quicker responses to future outbreaks. 4. Marburg Virus 4.1. Marburg Virus Outbreaks [30](#B30-vaccines-11-01120)]. Though initially human infection was thought to be the result of prolonged exposure to mines or caves with Rousettus aegyptiacus bats, human-to-human transmission via direct contact with infected bodily fluids, contact with contaminated surfaces, and contact with the body of the deceased can also result in transmission of MARV [ [31](#B31-vaccines-11-01120)]. Based on human data from 35 patients diagnosed with MVD who were treated at modern medical facilities, clinical signs generally appeared within 3-9 days post exposure. Symptoms worsened progressively to include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever, and exanthema or enanthema, which intensified during the second week of infection [ [32](#B32-vaccines-11-01120)]. To date, there have been 15 reported outbreaks, with the largest occurring in Angola in 2005, with 374 confirmed cases and 329 deaths [ [33](#B33-vaccines-11-01120)]. On 13 February 2023, the first-ever outbreak of MVD was confirmed in Equatorial Guinea within the Kie Ntem Province, with 15 laboratory-confirmed cases, 23 probable cases, and 11 deaths. Additionally, a second outbreak was confirmed on 21 March 2023 in Tanzania with 6 of the 9 total cases having died, including a healthcare worker [ [33](#B33-vaccines-11-01120)]. 4.2. 2023 Marburg Virus Response and Vaccine Pipeline [34](#B34-vaccines-11-01120)]. The group outlined a strategy for a ring vaccination study that would include individuals in high-risk and transmission clusters, or cluster randomization within transmission clusters, with the primary endpoint being laboratory-confirmed disease. Following this meeting, a vaccine prioritization committee was convened to consider updated information from the product developers and to assemble a vaccine clinical protocol for potential use in Equatorial Guinea. As there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics available against MARV, the only active means of treatment is through supportive care\u2014rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids\u2014and with treatment of symptoms. However, multiple vaccines are under development, four of which are actively being supported by BARDA, including the IAVI's attenuated VSVG vector [ chimpanzee adenovirus-based vaccine [ [37](#B37-vaccines-11-01120)], and an early stage program evaluating RNA-based vaccines. Similar to the recent SUDV outbreak, the MARV outbreaks have been controlled as of this writing and a ring vaccination protocol has not been implemented. Again, the partnerships with affected countries are critical, and these should be in place ahead of any outbreak if possible. [18](#B18-vaccines-11-01120), [38](#B38-vaccines-11-01120)]; Sabin recently completed a phase 1b clinical trial of ChAd3-MARV in the United States [ [21](#B21-vaccines-11-01120)] and will be initiating a phase 2 clinical trial in Uganda and Kenya [ [39](#B39-vaccines-11-01120)]. Vaccines that WHO considered to be within the landscape of candidates for a ring vaccination strategy\u2014Sabin's ChAd3 vaccine, IAVI and PHV's VSV vaccines, and the Ad26.Filo/MVA-BN-Filo vaccine from Janssen\u2014had all demonstrated protective efficacy in NHPs, with most efforts involving vectored vaccines [ [40](#B40-vaccines-11-01120), [41](#B41-vaccines-11-01120)]. At the time of this meeting, Sabin estimated that there were a few hundred filled doses immediately available for response, with thousands of doses of drug substance waiting to be filled. PHV indicated that 300 doses were immediately available; however, there was no additional bulk or active manufacturing ongoing. In addition, though they have an active program, the IAVI did not have doses available; however, the IAVI projected that additional doses would be available within a few months, as they were working to complete their process development [ [42](#B42-vaccines-11-01120)]. 5. BARDA Investments for Filovirus Vaccine Development and Preparedness (BARDA Investments in CMC, Clinical Doses, Models, Assays and NHSs, Critical Reagents) [43](#B43-vaccines-11-01120)]. For this reason, BARDA recently supported two natural history studies to characterize the progression of either MARV or SUDV in cynomolgus macaques. Both natural history studies included clinical observations of body weight, viremia, hematology, clinical chemistry, and coagulation and continuous body-temperature monitoring [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-01120), [44](#B44-vaccines-11-01120)]. Overall, these natural history studies confirmed the reproducibility and utility of cynomolgus macaques as animal models for MARV and SUDV and will be useful in evaluating future medical countermeasures for these pathogens. [15](#B15-vaccines-11-01120), [33](#B33-vaccines-11-01120)]. Due to the high mortality rates and increased frequency of filovirus outbreaks, it is critical to advance vaccine candidates to clinical development as soon as possible and expedite the production of cGMP doses even before licensure. During the 2022 SUDV outbreak, while cGMP doses of SUDV vaccine candidates were manufactured and shipped to Uganda in a record 79 days, vaccine doses could have arrived in Uganda far more expediently if cGMP doses were on hand and available for immediate shipment. With clinical doses on hand in an outbreak situation, a vaccine candidate could be deployed quickly to implement ring vaccination in a clinical study and potentially generate clinical efficacy data needed for the traditional pathway of vaccine licensure. 6.
