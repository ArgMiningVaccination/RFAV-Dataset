Approximately 50 percent of the general population have reported taking some form of dietary supplements, while 76 to 100 percent of athletes in some sports are reported to use them. Performance- Enhancing Drugs (PEDs) are pharmacologic agents that athletes and nonathlete weightlifters use to enhance performance [[1]](#cite_note-1) Physicians can evaluate these products by examining four factors (method of action, available research, adverse effects, legality) that will help them counsel patients. Common ergogenic aids include [Anabolic steroids](/The_influence_of_anabolic_steroids_on_physiologic_processes_and_exercise), which increase [muscle](/Muscle)mass. These illegal supplements are associated with a number of serious adverse effects, some irreversible. They represent one of the oldest classes of drugs of abuse and, accordingly, their effects have been most extensively investigated. When combined with exercise training, AASs increase muscle mass and strength and reduce fat [[2]](#cite_note-:0-2). [Creatine](/Creatine_and_Exercise)modestly improves athletic performance and appears to be relatively safe. - Dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione do not improve athletic performance but apparently have similar adverse effects as testosterone and are also banned by some sports organizations. [Caffeine](/Caffeine_and_Exercise)has mild benefits and side effects and is banned above certain levels. Products that combine caffeine with other stimulants (e.g., ephedrine) have been linked to fatal events. [Protein and carbohydrate](/Exercise_and_Protein_Supplements)supplementation provides modest benefits with no major adverse effects [[3]](#cite_note-3). Below there are additional links to pages (see also those above) regarding the influence certain drugs and performance enhancers can have on an individual and the exercise process.
