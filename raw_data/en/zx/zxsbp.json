A growing field of research examines how exposure to childhood adversity is translated into biological risk for psychopathology through alterations in immune system functioning,most notably heightened levels of inflammation biomarkers. Though our knowledge about how childhood adversity can instantiate biolog-ical risk for psychopathology is growing, there remain many challenges and gaps in the field to understand how inflammation from child-hood adversity contributes to psychopathology. This paper reviews research on the inflammatory outcomes arising from childhood adversityand presents four major challenges that future research must address: (a) the measurement of childhood adversity, (b) the measurement ofinflammation, (c) the identification of mediators between childhood adversity and inflammation, and (d) the identification of moderators ofinflammatory outcomes following childhood adversity. We discuss synergies and inconsistencies in the literature to summarize the currentunderstanding of the association between childhood adversity, a proinflammatory phenotype, and the biological risk for psychopathology.We discuss the clinical implications of the inflammatory links between childhood adversity and psychopathology, including possibilities forintervention. Finally, this review conclude by delineates future directions for research, including issues of how best to detect, prevent, andunderstand these \"hidden wounds \"of childhood adversity. Keywords: childhood adversity, inflammation, maltreatment, psychiatric disorders, psychopathology (Received 17 January 2020; revised 23 March 2020; accepted 30 June 2020) Introduction Childhood adversity is widespread and associated with increased risk for mental health problems and psychopathology in adult-hood (Danese, 2020; Humphreys & Teicher & Samson, 2013). Childhood adversities are defined as exposures to circumstances that represent a deviation from theexpectable environment, either chronic or severe and acute, dur-ing childhood or adolescence that require significant adaptationby an average child (McLaughlin, Sheridan, & Lambert, 2014). We will center our discussion of early life adversity (ELA) aroundthe construct of child victimization, which includes experiences ofmaltreatment by an adult (i.e., emotional, physical, or sexualabuse, and physical or emotional neglect) and bullying by peers(Danese & Lewis, 2017). ELA is associated with greater risk for developing mental disorders early and across the life course inhumans, and the odds of developing psychopathology increaseas exposure to adversity increases (Kessler, Davis, & Kendler,1997; Khandaker, Pearson, Zammit, Lewis, & Jones, 2010; Schaefer et al., 2018). Animal models of ELA experimentallyshow that the associations between early contexts of stress and later emotional and behavioral abnormalities is likely causal(Cryan & Holmes, 2005; Francis, Diorio, Liu, & 2001; Suomi, 1997). While exposure to ELA increases the odds of many psychiatric disorders, the association between ELA and different types of psy-chopathology is generally nonspecific (Green et al., 2010; Kessler et al., 1997; Kessler et al., 2010; McLaughlin et al., 2012; Schaefer et al., 2018). For example, childhood maltreatment predicts sev- eral psychiatric disorders, including depression, bipolar disorder,posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and schizophrenia (Gilbertet al., 2009; Varese et al., 2012; Widom, 1999). Childhood mal- treatment is associated with an unfavorable course of mental ill-ness, higher rates of comorbid disorders, and more complexpresentation of Nanni, Uher, & Danese, 2012). In addition, ELA is associated with many physical health outcomes, includingmetabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerativediseases, cancer, asthma, and aging (Scrivo, Vasile, Bartosiewicz, & Valesini, 2011). Given the nonspecific associations and the co-occurring risk for psychopathology and physical health disor-ders, inflammation has been proposed as the \"common soil \"by which adversity becomes biologically embedded to influencelater psychological and physical functioning (Scrivo et al., Author for Correspondence: Brie Reid, Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota; Minneapolis, MN.

Challenges in researching the immune pathways between early life adversity and psychopathology. Development and , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use.2011). The immune system, via inflammation, is increasingly rec- ognized as a pathway to developing psychopathology (Danese &Baldwin, 2017; Nusslock & Miller, 2016). In longitudinal studies of depression, high levels of inflammation predict an increasedrisk of developing depression, poor response to treatment(Strawbridge et al., 2015), and an unfavorable course of illness (Ford & Erlinger, 2004). In bipolar disorder, high levels of inflam- mation predict poor treatment response (Mondelli et al., 2015). All of these associations echo the negative psychopathology out-comes in individuals exposed to ELA (Danese & Baldwin, 2017). Research continues to find that ELA confers specific brain, behavioral, and physiological vulnerabilities to inflammation.There are several excellent reviews that outline the links betweenELA, inflammation, and psychopathology (Danese & Baldwin,2017; Danese & Lewis, 2017). This area is an exciting frontier in the understanding of the etiology and incidence of mental ill-ness arising from ELA. Thus, with the availability of multiplereviews, meta-analyses, and new data, this review outlines the out-standing questions on in the links from ELA to inflammation topsychopathology. We provide an overview of the current evidencethat connects ELA to increased inflammation and subsequent riskfor psychopathology. Then, we identify four challenges for thefield going forward. The first is the issue of measuring ELA,which includes the type and timing, dimensional approaches tothe construct of ELA, and construct invariance across longitudinalstudies. The second challenge is measuring inflammation itself,which includes questions about biomarker selection and tissue specificity in the study of ELA, inflammation, and psychopathol- ogy. Third, we review a number of proposed mechanistic path-ways that could mediate the relationship between childhoodadversity and inflammation to ultimately prevent ELA-exposedchildren from developing increased inflammation and psychopa-thology. As a great deal of heterogeneity exists in the literature onELA and inflammation, we propose that the fourth challenge ofthe field is a better understanding of moderators at play. Weput forward the hypotheses that differences in an individual 's age at the inflammation assessment, sex, and population contextcan explain the heterogeneity in outcomes. We conclude with adiscussion of the clinical and intervention implications as thefield continues to mature. Inflammation and psychopathology The immune system consists of two interconnected branches: innate and adaptive immunity. These branches detect and elimi-nate molecules and cells that represent a threat to our body,including foreign antigens, altered self-antigens, or cellular dam-age. Inflammation is part of the innate immune system and worksto protect against pathogens and repair tissue in contexts of ill-ness, injury, or infection. Innate immunity serves as the firstline of defense and is evolutionally older than adaptive immunity(Medzhitov, 2008). The innate immune system is composed of immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendriticcells, that constantly circulate in the body and detect a wide vari-ety of pathogens. When activated, these cells begin a rapid (i.e.,minutes to hours) cascade of processes to contain infection andpromote healing (Medzhitov, 2008). Inflammatory cytokines pro- mote vascular permeability and cellular adhesion so that immunecells can leave the blood vessels, migrate to tissues, and eliminatepathogens. Proinflammatory cytokines signal sites of injury orinfection to recruit immune cells to the site of inflammatory activ-ity (Murphy, 2011). However, if the regulatory processes inimmunity fail, this this can result in a prolonged, chronic, and nonresolving inflammatory response associated with cellularand tissue damage and poor mental and physical health outcomes(Nusslock & Miller, 2016). Low-grade inflammation is frequently assessed in human studies using the acute-phase proteinC-reactive protein (CRP) and the proinflammatory cytokineinterleukin-6 (IL-6), both of which can be measured in blood. Inflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of psychopa- thology in nonhuman animal models and human studies. Inexperimental animal models, the administration of bacterial cellcomponents (e.g., lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) or proinflammatorycytokines manipulates the organism 's inflammatory state and pro- duce symptoms that mirror psychopathology (e.g., disruptions insleep, food and water intake, social engagement, motor activity,and cognition) (Dantzer, O 'Connor, Freund, Johnson, & Kelley, 2008). These symptoms are worse in mice deficient in anti- inflammatory cytokines but improve if mice are subsequentlyadministered anti-inflammatory cytokines (Dantzer et al., 2008). Experimental studies in humans have replicated these findings.Early studies found that the experimental administration of proin-flammatory cytokines produced a clinical response that resemblesthat of major depression (Smith, 1991). Later studies demonstrate that the administration of proinflammatory mediators inducesdepressive-like symptoms in healthy participants and cancerpatients (Musselman et al., 2001; Reichenberg et al., 2001). Human studies of depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD, and schizophrenia show evidence of a link between inflammation and psychopathology development (Berk Modabbernia, Taslimi, Brietzke, & Ashrafi, 2013). Of these, the association between inflammation and psychopathology has beenbest characterized in the case of depression (Miller & Raison,2016). Patients with depression had immune cell profiles charac- terized by systemic inflammation (Maes et al., 1992). Moreover, a meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies that investigate the differ-ences in inflammation in depressed adults and healthy controlsfound that depression is characterized by small elevations ofinflammatory biomarkers in the blood (Howren, Lamkin, &Suls, 2009). In addition, anti-inflammatory medications have been found to have antidepressant effects in trial with a subgroupof depressed patients with high baseline levels of inflammation(Raison et al., 2013) and in a meta-analysis of trials (Kohler et al., 2014). The group differences between inflammation in depressed patients versus controls is likely due to bidirectionalassociations between depression and inflammation (Danese &Baldwin, 2017; Matthews et al., 2010). Concordantly, longitudinal associations between inflammation and subsequent psychopathol- ogy are reported in participants with depression (Valkanova,Ebmeier, & Allan, 2013), psychosis (Khandaker et al., 2014), and PTSD (Eraly et al., 2014; Michopoulos et al., 2015). Proposed mechanisms of inflammation and psychopathology While inflammation contributes positively to brain development,high levels can result in changes at multiple levels of brain func-tion and increase risk for psychopathology. In rodents and non-human primates, experimental studies show that infection andsystemic inflammation in the prenatal and neonatal periods leadto long-term impairments in learning, memory, and Schwarz, 2009; Knuesel et al., 2014; Patterson, 2009; Short et al., 2010). Observational studies in humans demonstrate links between prenatal infection and later risk for1598 B. Reid and A.

Experimental activation of the periph- eral system with LPS and other proinflammatory stimulants hassignificant effects on brain functioning in humans (Schedlowski,Engler, & Grigoleit, 2014). These effects include changes in cogni- tion with the reduction of verbal and nonverbal memory functions(Reichenberg et al., 2001) and changes in positive valence systems with the reduction of ventral striatum responses to reward(Capuron et al., 2012; Eisenberger et al., 2010). These effects include changes in negative valence systems, with increased amyg-dala activity in response to socially threatening stimuli (fear faces)(Inagaki, Muscatell, Irwin, Cole, & Eisenberger, 2012), reduced subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC)to the amygdala, and increases in the activity within the sACCduring emotional face processing (Harrison et al., 2009). Inflammation can affect brain and behavior mechanisticallythrough (a) brain neurochemistry, (b) brain development, neuroendocrine programming -pituitary -adrenal; HPA). We briefly review these mechanistic pathways and direct the reader to Danese and Lewis(2017) for a more comprehensive review. First, inflammation can affect brain neurochemistry through monoamine and glutamate metabolism. Inflammatory cytokinescan affect monoamine transmission through reduced monoaminesynthesis and increased expression of the presynaptic transporter, reducing monoamine availability in the brain (Miller & Raison, 2015). Inflammatory cytokines can increase glutamine transmis- sion through reduced expression of the presynaptic transporter,thereby increasing glutamate release and availability in the brain(Miller & Raison, 2016). Second, inflammation plays an integral role in brain develop- ment. Prenatally, the immune system affects cell proliferationand migration (Boulanger, 2009). Postnatally, the immune (Beattie et 2003; Ziv et al., 2006). Early exposure to inflammation has long-term impacts on thebrain and behavior of rodents (Bilbo & Schwarz, 2009; Knuesel et al., 2014; Patterson, 2009) and nonhuman primates (Short et al., 2010). In humans, higher levels of serum inflammation in childhood has been associated with increased risk of depressionand psychosis in adulthood (Khandaker et al., 2014). The brain 's specialized immune cells (e.g., microglia and T cells) and cytokines contribute to normal brain functioning andthus may be directly affected by disruptions in immune function-ing (Boulanger, 2009; Deverman & Patterson, 2009 ; Yirmiya & Goshen, 2011). The innate immune system supports tissue remod- eling involved in mechanisms of brain plasticity. For example,microglia in their resting state play important roles in adult brainfunction (Hanisch & Kettenmann, 2007). T cells in the brain mon- itor and respond to signals in the cerebrospinal fluid and play a rolein learning and memory in adults by stimulating neurogenesis andpromoting expression of brain-derived neurotrophic by microglia and T cells, supportbrain plasticity (Yirmiya & Goshen, 2011). Exaggerated or chronic neuroinflammation, however, is associated with impaired brainfunction such as poor learning and memory (Yirmiya & Goshen,2011). Microglia produce proinflammatory cytokines upon inflammatory prostaglandins, and free radicals, allof which can have neurotoxic effects and suppress neurogenesis(Hanisch & Kettenmann, 2007). Upon detection of inflammatory signals, T cells are involved in triggering protective immuneresponses that could be detrimental to brain function. Third, inflammation affects microglial reactivity and can prime immune cells to be more reactive upon subsequent psychosocialstressors, resulting in increased inflammation. Early life inflam-mation can activate and prime microglia to subsequent inflamma-tory stimuli, thereby influencing later inflammatory responses tostressors (Perry & Holmes, 2014). Inflammation may downregu- late neuronal ligands responsible for inhibiting this primingresponse (Perry & Holmes, 2014). Similar effects may occur if microglia are less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of glucocorti-coids (Frank, Watkins, & Maier, 2013). Rodents with primed microglia exhibit increased proinflammatory cytokine productionin the brain, increased neurotoxicity, and exaggerated sicknessbehavior when exposed to subsequent inflammatory stimulation(Perry & Holmes, 2014). Thus, microglia can be activated and primed by inflammatory stimuli and mount a greater inflamma-tory response from subsequent immune stimulation. Early lifeseems to be a sensitive period for this microglial priming (Bilbo& Schwarz, 2009; Knuesel et al., 2014). Fourth, inflammation can sensitize the neuroendocrine and immune systems in a bidirectional fashion (Danese & Lewis,2017). In acute immune stimulation, the HPA axis is activated similar to activation following exposure to a stressor(Besedovsky, del Rey, Sorkin, & Dinarello, 1986; Dunn, 2000). Evidence from animal models suggests that the immune systemmay program the HPA axis response during sensitive periods ofdevelopment. In rodents, early life immune stimulation withLPS is associated with HPA axis abnormalities that are linkedto psychopathology, including increased corticotropin-releasinghormone (CRH) levels, increased adrenocorticotropic hormone(ACTH) and corticosterone production in response to stress,decreased negative feedback sensitivity to glucocorticoids, andreductions in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) density in 2001; Shanks, Larocque, & Meaney, 1995; al., 2000). If cytokines chronically stimulate the HPA axis, this can result in insufficient glucocorticoid signaling, inhib-ited BDNF secretion, inhibited nerve (Dantzer et al., 2008; Yirmiya & Goshen, 2011). These results suggest that the immune system 's programming of the HPA axis programming is part of the causalpathway between early life immune stimulation and psychopa-thology (Danese & Lewis, 2017). Together, the brain neurochem- istry, developmental, priming, and neuroendocrine effectsdemonstrate evidence of direct and long-term risk for psychopa-thology (Boulanger, 2009). Early life adversity and inflammation As ELA cannot be randomly assigned or manipulated in humans, animal models provide a support for causal inference in the linkbetween early life stress and increased inflammation. Evidencefrom animal models point to associations between early life stressparadigms and immune system functioning (for comprehensivereviews, we point the reader to (Ganguly & at , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use.Hennessy, Deak, & Schiml-Webb, 2010 a; Shanks & Lightman, 2001 ). Although not analogous to all forms of ELA in humans, maternal separation as an ELA paradigm in nonhuman animalmodels paints the most consistent picture linking ELA withinflammation. Rodent and nonhuman primate models ofmaternal separation provide increased peripheralinflammatory biomarkers, markers of neuroinflammation, andgreater proinflammatory response in response to subsequentstress (Coe, Rosenberg, & Levine, 1988 ; Cole et al., 2012 ; Hennessy, Deak, Schiml-Webb, Carlisle, & O 'Brien, 2010 2013 ). neuroinflam- include blunted Simen, Mane, microglial in the midbrain areas of rodent pups (Chocyk et al., 2011 ), increased expression of proinflammatory cytokine receptors in the hippocampus(Viviani et al., & Thompson,2015 ). Maternal separation in rodent models show a greater proinflammatory response in the brain and periphery when ani-mals are exposed to later stressors (Avitsur, Hunzeker, &Sheridan, 2006 ; Brenhouse & Thompson, 2015 ; Hennessy et al., 2010 b). Research Questions Many thoughtful reviews, theoretical papers, and meta-analyses have been written on studies of ELA and inflammation in humans(Baumeister, Akhtar, et al., 2020; Nusslock & Miller, 2016). This domain of research is rapidly expanding, and this review brings together the outstand-ing and developmentally focused research questions moving for-ward. As the field has relatively heterogeneous inflammationoutcome measures, we focus our discussion on CRP, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, a common trio of inflamma- tory markers associated with psychopathology in humans (Yuan,Chen, Xia, Dai, & Liu, 2019). We take a developmental focus because, in contrast to the studies on ELA and inflammation in adults, the literature onELA and inflammation in infants, children, and adolescents isstill in its early stages. A meta-analysis of 13 studies on ELAand inflammation in pediatric samples highlight the relativelack of studies overall, the high levels of heterogeneity of ELAand inflammation measures, and mixed results (Kuhlman et al.,2020). Though this recent meta-analysis did not find a statistically significant association between ELA and inflammation, theauthors argued that this was due to too much heterogeneity acrosspediatric studies (Kuhlman et al., 2020). The ELA constructs, types of inflammation assessment, and timing of the inflamma-tion assessment varied widely in these studies. The mixed resultsare not all together surprising when looking toward reviews of theanimal literature, which find mixed results due to a multiplicity ofstressors and inflammatory measures (Ganguly & Brenhouse,2015; Hennessy et al., 2010a; Shanks & Lightman, 2001). Therefore, as the field continues to grow, the field must addresshow to consistently measure ELA, consistently measure inflam-mation, test mediators, and account for moderators with a devel-opmental lens. We refer the reader to Table 1 , which codes the studies discussed relevant to the following research questionsections.Measuring early life stress Are there features of ELA experiences or its measurement that are more strongly associated with inflammation? Within the study ofELA and inflammation in pediatric populations, we must clarify ifthere is a difference in inflammatory outcomes when measuringELA prospectively versus retrospectively and when assessingELA with objective or subjective measures. Further, would dimen-sional approaches to the measurement of ELA clarify research onELA and inflammation if applied? For example, researchers haveproposed that experiences of \"deprivation \"and \"threat \"in ELA contexts act as different dimensions and interact to produce arange of different outcomes (McLaughlin et al., 2014). Finally, how does construct invariance in the measurement of ELA impactthe research examining inflammatory outcomes longitudinally?Precision in the measurement and definition of ELA, then, isthe first challenge if the field seeks to better understand the rela-tionship between ELA, inflammation, and psychopathology acrossdevelopment. Measurement of early life adversity How adversity is assessed, whether through objective or self-report measures, prospectively or retrospectively, has long beena consideration in the study of child adversity. A recent studyhighlights this reporting discrepancy, as it found poor agreementbetween prospective and retrospective reports of childhood mal-treatment within the same individuals (Baldwin, Reuben,Newbury, & Danese, 2019). The literature provides no clarity about how the reporting of ELA affects inflammatory outcomes.Part of this lack of clarity arises from a lack of formal delineationbetween prospective measures and retrospective measures of ELA.Few studies on inflammation arising from ELA have prospectiveand retrospective measures to compare directly. One study thatmakes the comparison is the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Healthand Development Study, which showed that inflammation atage 32 y was more strongly associated with prospective compared to retrospective measures of ELA (Reuben et al., 2016). However, data from the 1958 British Cohort ( N= 7,661) that included pro- spective and retrospective measures of victimization found more mixed results, with positive associations between ELA and inflam-mation dependent on the type of ELA exposure (Pinto Pereiraet al., 2019). Another related area that requires clarification is how the source of information on ELA influences outcomes.Retrospective measures are, by necessity, self-reports, while pro-spective measures can include objective information (e.g., courtreports), parent reports, or self-reports on ELA. The few studiesthat do use objective measures of ELA found inconsistent evi-dence for a link between ELA and inflammation. Osborn andWidom ( 2019) have recently shown that individuals with official reports of child maltreatment (specifically physical abuse) hadsignificantly higher levels of CRP than nonmaltreated individuals,yet two studies using Child Protective Services (CPS) referralsfound association between CRP and maltreatment (Bernardet al., 2019; Cicchetti et al., 2015). Other studies of adolescents and adults exposed to objectively and prospectively assessedELA in the form of institutional care have found no associationbetween neglect exposure and inflammatory biomarkers(Elwenspoek et al., 2017; Reid et al., 2019; Slopen et al., 2019). Perhaps the ultimate challenge across measures is that the effect sizes between ELA and inflammation are small, and withoutadequately powered studies the outcomes are predictably1600 B. Reid and A.

A meta-analysis of 25 studies on ELA and plasma levels of inflammation in adulthood found small but significanteffect sizes, though most studies included ELA measured broadlyand retrospectively in adulthood (Baumeister et al., 2016). Prospective studies of ELA in large cohorts have also found pos-itive associations between ELA and inflammation, though the sig-nificant inflammation biomarker outcome differs between them(Baldwin et al., 2015; Flouri, Francesconi, Midouhas, & Lewis, 2020). Adequately powered studies in large, longitudinal cohorts with both prospective and retrospective mea-sures of ELA and a consistent set of inflammation biomarkerscould help clarify the issue of ELA measurement as it relates toinflammation risk. Dimensional approaches to the measurement of early life stress typeA second question is whether inflammation outcomes differdepending on the dimension or type of adversity exposure.Numerous studies have found different outcomes when examiningseparate types of childhood adversity. In meta-analysis of ELA expo-sure and inflammation in pediatric populations, the types of ELAexposure were too different to compare dimensionally (Kuhlmanet al., 2020). Future research would benefit from outlining diversity in the type of adversity exposure to examine the development of a proinflammatory phenotype and risk for psychopathology.McLaughlin et al. ( 2014) propose a dimensional approach to disen- tangle the effects of ELA on neurodevelopment, and we propose thatthis dimensional approach could be applied to the study of inflam-matory outcomes. The approach distinguishes \"threat, \"or experi- ences that threaten an individual 's physical integrity, and \"deprivation, \"which encompasses the lack of species-expected envi- ronmental inputs and/or environmental complexity (McLaughlinet al., 2014). While deprivation and threat often co-occur in contexts where children are victimized, measuring both may clarify differen-tial inflammation and psychopathology outcomes. In this section,we review a few select studies to highlight the measurement ques- t i o n st h a tr e m a i ni nt h i sa r e a . Experiences of threat include those that involve physical or sexual violence, threat of death, or other physical harm(McLaughlin et al., 2014). In adult populations, there are a few examples of examining \"threat \"types of childhood adversity as they relate to inflammatory outcomes. In subgroup analyses in ameta-analysis, the type of ELA exhibited contrasting results inspecific inflammatory outcomes (Baumeister et al., 2016). Childhood sexual abuse was positively associated with TNF- but not with IL-6 or CRP. Childhood physical abuse was associ-ated with TNF- and IL-6 but not CRP (Baumeister et al., 2016). An analysis of two large adult cohorts mentioned previ- ously examined different types of childhood adversity on adultlevels of inflammation (Pinto Pereira et al., 2019). In the British cohort, increased inflammation in adulthood was positively asso-ciated with physical abuse but not sexual abuse (Pinto Pereiraet al., 2019). In the US cohort, physical abuse was not associated with either IL-6 or CRP in adulthood (Pinto Pereira et al., 2019). However, childhood sexual abuse was significantly associated withIL-6 and CRP for nonwhites only (Pinto Pereira et al., 2019). In studies of pediatric populations, threat experiences of maltreat-ment and victimization are positively associated with inflamma-tion in some studies (Baldwin et al., 2018; Bucker et al., 2015; Danese et al., 2019; Kilic et al., 2017) but not all (Bernard et al., 2019; Cicchetti et al., 2015; Miller & Cole, 2012).One component of the dimensional approach to measuring ELA is the grounding of the dimensions in current evidence onneurodevelopment (McLaughlin et al., 2014). Threat experiences may result in changes to emotional learning networks(Johansen, Cain, Ostroff, & LeDoux, 2011; LeDoux, 2003; McLaughlin et al., 2014). Kraynak et al. looked at pathways from childhood abuse to systemic inflammation and corticolimbicfunctionality in healthy adults and found that childhood abusewas associated with increased IL-6 and indirectly associatedwith reduced amygdala prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) connectivity (2019). Consistent with recent neurobio-logical models of early life threat experiences, associationsbetween childhood physical abuse and adulthood corticolimbiccircuit functionality may be partially explained by inflammatoryprocesses (Kraynak et al., 2019). Interestingly, with amygdala -ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity, did not statistically associate with childhood phys-ical abuse (Kraynak et al., 2019). This study provides preliminary evidence of how a dimensional and neurobiological approach mayelucidate ELA -inflammation -psychopathology connections. In contrast to the construct of \"threat, \"deprivation experiences are defined as the absence of expected environmental inputs (i.e.,cognitive inputs, social inputs, and environmental stimuli that arespecies- and age-typical in their complexity (McLaughlin et al.,2014). Experiences of deprivation are central for children who have been institutionalized (i.e., orphanage care), children experi-encing neglect, and children in contexts of poverty. Few studies of adult cohorts operationalize neglect as a separate dimensional construct, and the definition of neglect is heterogeneous acrossand within these studies. For example, emotional neglect wasnot associated with either IL-6 or CRP in a large US cohortand physical neglect but not emotional neglect was positivelyassociated with inflammation in a large British cohort (PintoPereira et al., 2019). The Baumeister meta-analysis demonstrated that parental absence was significantly and positively associatedwith CRP, though the measures of deprivation across the studieswere highly inconsistent (Baumeister et al., 2016). Studies of adults and children who experienced institutional care early in life provide an opportunity to examine the dimen-sion of deprivation as it relates to inflammatory outcomes.Institutional care typically involves environmental deprivation,caregiver separation, and neglect. Two studies that focused onneglect exposure and subsequent inflammation compared previ-ously institutionalized (PI) adolescents to community controls.One study examined youth adopted out of institutional carebefore the age of 2 y into well-resourced families in the UnitedStates (Reid et al., 2019) and another examined youth who either remained in institutional care or were randomly assigned to a fos-ter care intervention (Slopen et al., 2019). These studies of adoles- cents removed from institutional care as infants provideopportunities to look at sensitive periods of adversity exposureas it relates to inflammation and compare differences in behavio-ral and environmental inputs. Neither study found evidence ofincreased peripheral inflammation in PI adolescents (Reid et al.,2019; Slopen et al., 2019). One study found no differences in plasma levels of inflammation in PI and comparison adolescents(Reid et al., 2019), which replicated findings in PI adults (Elwenspoek et al., 2017a). These studies are consistent with a study with the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, in whichinflammation (CRP, IL-6, IL-8, TNF- ) was measured in spots in adolescent follow-up of institutionalized infants randomized to care as usual ( n= 68) or foster care intervention1606 B. Reid and A. Danese Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core . 03 Feb 2021 at 17:28:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use.(n= 68), and compared to never institutionalized controls ( n= 127). The study found no differences in levels of peripheralinflammation markers between the PI and comparison adoles-cents (Slopen et al., 2019). However, further post hoc analyses found differences in CRP only in PI adolescents who exhibitedan increasing adiposity trajectory and glucose dysregulation,though this group of adolescents was a small subset of the fullPI sample (Tang et al., 2018). Unfortunately, none of the studies reviewed have a dimen- sional measure of threat and deprivation, and many of the condi-tions of threat and deprivation co-occur. Current studies suggestthat inflammatory outcomes can be diverse even between differentthreat and deprivation exposures. The field would be well servedby research that includes dimensional measures of threat and dep-rivation in better understand how dimensional constructs of ELAdo-or do not -result in a proinflammatory phenotype. Construct invariance from infancy to childhood and adolescence Longitudinal construct invariance is the third measurement research question for the study of ELA and inflammation. Many studies measure the family environment in infancy andearly childhood, as this proximal family environment is thoughtto best capture experiences of adversity very young found was positively and independently associated with socioeco-nomic disadvantage and maternal stress in 18-month-olds. Incontrast, a study of 125 5-year-olds found no adversity and salivary IL-6 or TNF-alpha (Riis et al.,2016). In a prospective, longitudinal cohort of 600 adolescents, exposure to family-level adversity in infancy predicted higher lev-els of CRP, mediated through higher BMI in childhood (Reidet al., 2020). Finally, a study of 337 11-year-olds found no associ- ation between family-level adversity in infancy and IL-6 orTNF-alpha. The study found significant associations only betweencaregiver depressive symptoms in infancy and higher levels ofCRP in childhood (O 'Connor et al., 2020). Few studies examine ELA in infancy and early childhood, and none yet provide clarityaround construct invariance from family adversity to later formsof ELA and inflammation. Measuring inflammation/immune biomarkers Questions on the measurement of inflammation are equally important to the questions of measuring ELA. Namely, what are the best inflammation biomarkers to measure associations between ELA, inflammation, and psychopathology? The natureof human research on psychopathology is that we are limited pri-marily to inflammatory biomarkers in the periphery, not thebrain. This some challenges, which include (a) the interpretationof peripheral blood biomarkers of inflammation to brain mea-sures of inflammation (i.e., tissue specificity) and (b) the selectionof inflammation biomarkers from many different inflammatorycytokine options. Tissue specificity Though the connection between peripheral inflammation andneuroinflammation has been made (Miller & Raison, 2016), there are still open questions that researchers should continueto acknowledge when studying adversity, inflammation, and psy-chopathology risk. A meta-analysis of studies examining cerebro-spinal fluid, positron emission tomography and postmortembrain tissue in patients with depression found that patients withdepression have higher cerebral spinal fluid levels of IL-6 and TNF- than controls. However, there was little correlation between central and peripheral markers of inflammation in thestudies reviewed, which may reflect a lack of connection betweencentral and peripheral inflammation or other possible moderatingfactors (Enache, Pariante, & Mondelli, 2019). Nonetheless, mea- sures in blood, and therefore blood draws, are considered thegold standard for inflammatory biomarker measurement inpopulation-based studies. Most studies investigating the linksbetween ELA and inflammation focus on blood as the target tis-sue of interest in populations of adults, adolescents, and manystudies of children. Large-scale studies and studies of infants and children often use less invasive biomarkers for acceptability and cost. Blooddraws can be cost-prohibitive, not feasible, and are not minimallyinvasive. One less invasive methods of collection for inflamma-tory biomarkers involve finger prick and blood spot (McDade,Williams, & Snodgrass, 2007). The blood spot cards are let to dry and can be stored until laboratory analysis with good stability.Levels of inflammation biomarkers, such as CRP, in dried & Dohnal, 2004). Analysis of ELA-related inflammation abnormalities in dried blood spot showed results comparable tothose in serum (Copeland et al., 2014; Danese et al., 2011). As such, there is interest in developing further inflammation bio-markers including cytokines from dried blood spots. Blood draws and dried blood spots may be considered too invasive in studies with healthy infants or young children. Reflecting this, the majority of the studies in infancy and earlychildhood (0 -5 years) in this review use salivary markers of inflammation, which limits our ability to compare these withstudies in older children and adults. Several studies have reportedpoor correlations between saliva and blood for inflammatorymarkers (Dillon et al., 2009; Riis et al., 2016), likely due to the rel- ative difficulty that most proteins have in passing the multiplebarriers between blood and saliva compartments. Cytokines aretoo large to enter the mouth from the periphery through passivediffusion and instead enter through sites of inflammation or tis-sue damage, producing large variability between individuals(Bosch, 2014). Thus, while salivary cytokines are mostly indicative of local inflammation (Bosch, 2014), they may still serve as impor- tant indicators of health status while taking care to control fordental health confounds (Slavish, Graham-Engeland, Smyth, &Engeland, 2015). As in any tissue, the type of inflammatory bio- marker assessed is important. CRP from saliva has been associ-ated with CRP in circulating blood more consistently than otherinflammatory biomarkers, perhaps because CRP is produced inthe liver, not in the mouth, and its most likely route into salivais via blood (Slavish et al., 2015). A validation study of a high- sensitivity CRP assay in saliva allowed prediction of serum CRPin healthy adults (Ouellet-Morin, Danese, Williams, &Arseneault, 2011). Markers of salivary inflammation have been stable across time in adolescent samples in the short and longterm (when averaging across multiple assessments) (Shields,Slavich, Perlman, Klein, & Kotov, 2019). More research is needed to establish both the health relevance and the mechanisms drivingsalivary inflammation generally and across development. Furtherresearch is needed to determine how ELA relates to salivaryinflammation, what increased salivary inflammation means forinfants and young children in the short term, whether this mea-sure is associated with blood levels of inflammation, or what the long-term implications of increased salivary inflammation are. Development and Psychopathology 1607 03 Feb 2021 at subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use.Biomarker (cytokine) selection Diverse inflammatory markers have been used to test the associa-tion between ELA and inflammation. To counteract the literature 's heterogeneity, longitudinal and system-wide studies of inflamma-tion regulation with multiple biomarkers that can differentiatetrait- and state-specific changes in the context of childhood adver-sity would improve our understanding of etiology and establishvaluable biomarkers. Del Guidice that and CRP assays alone are not enough to establishthe existence of inflammatory states due to their multiple rolesand states in the body, a concept accepted in immunology researchbut rarely addressed in behavioral research (Del Giudice &Gangestad, 2018). For example, IL-6 and CRP might be elevated for maintenance functions and not necessarily indicative of anaberrant and chronic inflammatory state. Future studies shouldconsider using IL-6 and CRP alongside additional inflammatorybiomarkers (e.g., IL-1B, TNF-alpha, and circulating levels of solubleIL-6 receptors such as sIL-6R) (Del Giudice & Gangestad, 2018). A meta-analysis of 704 publications on psychopathology and 44inflammatory biomarkers found that related disorders share similarpatterns of inflammatory changes (Yuan et al., 2019). Longitudinal studies of inflammation regulation with multiple biomarkers couldhelp differentiate trait- and state-specific changes in psychopathol-ogy to establish valuable biomarkers in the ELA literature (Yuanet al., 2019). Mediation: Mechanisms linking early life stress and inflammation Mechanisms through which ELA could contribute to chronic inflammation include genetic risk, exposure to acute immuneresponses early in life, behavior, neuroendocrine dysregulation,adipose tissue, gut microbiome dysbiosis, and stress-induced dis-ruptions to nutrient metabolism, among others. This review is notexhaustive but seeks to highlight important and modifiable path-ways by which ELA could contribute to inflammation andincrease the subsequent risk for psychopathology. We integrateinsights from provide support for the current theoretical mecha-nisms and offer alternative or contradicting evidence to informresearch agendas going forward. Gene-environment correlation The genetic vulnerability of inflammation is estimated to accountfor between 13% -30% of within-subjects variability of CRP (Pankow et al., 2001), and there may be shared, underlying genetic vulnerability to ELA, psychopathology, and inflammation (2017).Immune-related genetic pathways have been found to predict riskfor several types of psychopathology (Network & PathwayAnalysis Subgroup of Psychiatric Genomics, 2015). Danese & Baldwin ( 2017) note that an individual exhibiting early behavioral expressions of genetic vulnerability to psychopathology (e.g.,emotional dysregulation, oppositional behavior) might increasetheir risk of maltreatment in childhood. However, the study onvictimization by Baldwin et al. ( 2018) with a genetically informa- tive sample of twins found that exposure to ELA was associatedwith increased inflammation above and beyond the genetic riskfor increased inflammation, further suggesting that while geneticsplays a role, additional mechanisms are at play. Acute inflammatory responses Acute inflammation in response to physical trauma, infection, orexposure to pathogens during sensitive periods early in life maystimulate microglia and neuroendocrine activity and affect brain development. Acute inflammatory responses can be incitedthrough psychological stress or in the context of physical trauma,as children exposed to ELA are more likely to be exposed to phys-ical injuries (Gilbert et al., 2009). Children exposed to ELA are more likely to be exposed to infection (Gilbert et al., 2009) and psychological stress and traumatic experiences can increase sus-ceptibility to both infections and recurrent viral infections(Cohen et al., 2012; Shirtcliff, Coe, & Pollak, 2009). ELA could contribute to systemic inflammation through these recurrentacute immune perturbations, but this pathway may not be appli-cable in all contexts. For example, in the studies of PI adolescentsand young adults mentioned earlier in this paper, ELA-exposedyouth have been found to exhibit higher levels of cytomegalovirus(CMV) titers, likely due to increased exposure to infectious dis-ease and pathogens in institutional care (Elwenspoek et al.,2017b; Reid et al., 2019). ELA and CMV exposure were associated with acquired immune system perturbations and markers ofT-cell senescence, but not higher levels of inflammation(Elwenspoek et al., 2017b; Reid et al., 2019). In addition, McDade 's study of a prospective birth cohort in the Philippines found that ELA was associated with adult levels of inflammationonly in individuals with low levels of microbial exposure ininfancy (McDade, Rutherford, Adair, & Kuzawa, 2010). It is unclear how ELA and early infection interact, the salience of spe-cific pathogen exposures, and how infection affects the developingimmune system. For instance, PI youth are not at increased risk of more inflammation (Elwenspoek et al., 2017a; Reid et al., 2019; Slopen et al., 2019), but they are at increased risk of psychopathol- ogy (Gunnar & Reid, 2019). In the Philippines cohort, there was no evidence of association between depressive symptomology inadulthood and increased inflammation (McDade, Borja, Adair,&K u z a w a , 2013). In contexts where infectious disease burden is high, pathogen exposure may act as a protective factor in the path-way from ELA, inflammation, and psychopathology (McDade,2012). Future work should consider operationalizing pathogen and infection exposure across development to better understandinflammation and psychopathology risk. Neuroendocrine dysregulation Psychological stress can indirectly contribute to inflammation byinducing neuroendocrine abnormalities and changes in HPA axisphysiology. The HPA axis is a key neuroendocrine pathwayinvolved in processes critical to homeostasis, including an organ-ism's responses to challenge, metabolism, and immune activity. Peripheral and central HPA axis mediators affect brain function(McEwen, Weiss, & Schwartz, 1968), and early life experiences can significantly shape the development and subsequent function-ing of the HPA axis (Levine, Alpert, & Lewis, 1957). Furthermore, the HPA axis and the immune system relate to each other indynamic and bidirectional ways. Inflammation can activate theHPA axis and and suppressesproinflammatory responses (Barnes & Adcock, 2009; Besedovsky et al., 1986). In situations where chronic stress leads to HPA upre- gulation, immune cells can become insensitive to the GR-mediated inhibitory effects of cortisol after excessive exposureover long periods, thought to be indicative of \"glucocorticoid resistance \"(Cohen et al., 2012; Kuhlman et al., 2020; Miller, Chen, & Parker, 2011b). HPA biology in humans is typically measured in the context of cortisol reactivity to stress and the diurnal rhythm of cortisolsecretion, which reflect the ability of the HPA axis to regulate1608 B. Reid and A. Danese https://www.cambridge.org/core . 03 Feb 2021 at 17:28:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use.responses to stress and to modulate circadian rhythm. In chronic ELA exposures, the evidence suggests that the HPA axis respon-sivity can either upregulate, where cortisol becomes chronicallyelevated, or downregulate, the HPA axis becomes becomeflat and unresponsive (McEwen, 2007,2012). In general, current evidence shows that childhood adversity is associated withheightened activity of the axis (Koss & Gunnar, 2018; Sanchez et al., 2001). If the axis is chronically elevated, it may produce a blunted cortisol response (Koss & Gunnar, 2018; Sanchez et al., 2001). Blunted cortisol patterns have been found in studies of PI chil- (Koss, neglect and maltreatment (Bernard, Hostinar, & Dozier, 2015; Bruce, Fisher, Pears, & Levine, 2009). Blunted cortisol patterns may lead to different Neuroendocrine\u00d7Immune System interactions.Inflammatory cytokine production is typically inhibited whencortisol binds to GRs in healthy immune cells (Barnes &Adcock, 2009). Thus, in the case of downregulated HPA activity, low circulating levels of cortisol might induce elevated levels ofinflammatory cytokines (Del Giudice & Gangestad, 2018). Studies have found insufficient glucocorticoid signaling in adoles-cents and adults with a history of childhood maltreatment, whichcould bring about systemic inflammation (Heim, & Ritchey, 2002; Miller, Freedland, Carney, Stetler, & Banks, 2003). However, this finding is not always consistent: the study of 11-year-olds mentioned pre- viously found no association between glucocorticoid resistance and either ELA exposure in infancy or inflammation at 11years, even though early adversity exposure was positively associ-ated with inflammation (O 'Connor et al., 2020). It is unclear whether this discrepancy is a result of the need for cumulativeadversities to result in glucocorticoid resistance, a level of adver-sity that was not severe enough to impact glucocorticoid resis-tance, or an indication of multiple adversity-to-inflammationpathways across development. Proinflammatory effects on immune cells in development may only be reliably observed when immune cells are stimulated invitro, not when measured in circulation (Kuhlman et al., 2020). If youth exposed to ELA exhibit elevated concentrations of corti-sol, this upregulation may be masking the proinflammatory phe-notype in children if inflammation is measured with circulatingmarkers (Kuhlman et al., 2020; Tarullo & Gunnar, 2006). Chronic HPA activation during sensitive developmental periodscan induce epigenetic changes in the GR, reducing signaling ina compensatory manner (Weaver et al., 2004). This signal reduc- tion could lead to resistance to cortisol 's anti-inflammatory prop- erties. ELA is associated with DNA demethylation in theglucocorticoid response elements of the FK506 binding protein5(FKBP5 ) gene and reduced sensitivity to glucocorticoids 'inhib- itory effect on IL-6 production in peripheral blood immune cellsstimulated in vitro (Klengel et al., 2013). A study in 18-year-old females retrospectively reporting ELA did not find higher levelsof peripheral IL-6, but in vitro analyses found pronounced cyto-kine responses to bacterial challenge and evidence for decreasedefficacy of cortisol to regulate the inflammatory response(Miller & Chen, 2010). HPA axis and immune system interactions highlight the need to consider how neuroendocrine responses toadversity may increase risk for psychopathology through alter-ations in the co-regulation of multiple systems. Few studies onchildhood adversity investigate HPA axis functioning with immune functioning (Kuhlman et al., 2020). More complex models mightclarify how childhood adversity impacts the brain and behavior through both HPA- and immune-mediating systems. Gut microbiome dysbiosis Growing evidence suggests that the microbiome plays a role in thepathway between ELA, stress-mediating and immune-systemdevelopment, and mental health. The gut microbiome is involvedin the immune system development and function (Hooper,Littman, & Macpherson, 2012). Its effects include changes in inflammation (Cani, Osto, Geurts, & Everard, 2012; Wells et al., 2017) and immune competence in response to pathogen exposure and (Mackos, (Cryan ; McVey Neufeld, Mao, Bienenstock, Foster, & Kunze, 2013). ELA may alter communication between the gut and the brain through altered vagus nerve and enteric nervoussystem & Miller, 2004). Psychosocial stress has been associated with changes in gut microbiota structure and activity (Mackos et al.,2017). In rodent and nonhuman primate models, early maternal separation has transient and long-term effects on the gut micro-biota (Bailey & Coe, 1999;O'Mahony et al., 2009). In murine models, ELS-induced alterations of the microbiome Bale, 2015). Changes to the gut microbiome in these models have been asso-ciated with anxiety-like behaviors and activation of stress-mediating systems (Gareau et al., 2008). Rodents exposed to stress exhibit inflammation, altered gastrointestinal (GI) function andpermeability, and differences in immune activity (Gareau et al.,2008). In humans, differences in the gut microbiome have been found in adults who have developed PTSD after trauma exposureand adults with a history of childhood trauma (Hemmings et al.,2017). ELA-exposed children have also been found to exhibit gut microbiome differences (Callaghan et al., 2020). Although con- ducted in a small sample of children, this study observed thatgut bacteria levels were correlated with prefrontal cortex activa-tion to emotional faces (Callaghan et al., 2020). The relationship between ELA-induced gut dysbiosis and inflammation are likelybidirectional Hooper al., 2012). Stress-induced metabolism disruptions Disruptions to nutrient metabolism is an unexplored pathway bywhich ELS can lead to inflammation. To function properly, thedeveloping immune system requires macronutrients (i.e., protein,fat, carbohydrates) and micronutrients and dysregulated neuroendocrine path-ways can disrupt nutrient metabolism even in the ade-quate nutrient intake (Monk, Georgieff, & Osterholm, 2013; Suchdev et al., 2017) and lead to through disruptions in immune functioning. There are many required nutrients for immune sys-tem development, but we will use iron as an illustrative example.Iron deficiency is one of the most common forms of malnutrition,with an estimated 4 in 10 children under 5 being affected (Stevenset al., 2013), and children exposed to ELA are often at higher risk of iron deficiency. Adequate iron intake and utilization is neces-sary for normal white blood cell and cytokine function (Coe,Lubach, & Shirtcliff, 2007). In murine models, at , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use.pathways in the adult brain even after iron repletion. Neonatal iron deficiency also reduced anti-inflammatory gene expressionand altered cell-mediated immune response genes in infantmice (Tran, Singh, Wallin, & Georgieff, 2018). Research from a nonhuman primates showed that exposure to early life stressresulted in lower levels of iron and iron status subsequently pre-dicted greater deficits in innate immune system functioning(Coe et al., 2007). Few studies exist in human models, but one study found that a randomized control trial of iron supplementa-tion was associated with decreased levels of inflammation in acohort of adolescents, even after exposure to ELA in infancy(Reid et al., 2020). ELA-induced nutrient dysregulation could be a mediator that is ripe for research and intervention. Adipose tissue Adipose tissue generates and regulates about one-third of circulat-ing inflammatory markers (Black, 2003). Obesity in childhood is associated with low-grade inflammation (Visser, Bouter,McQuillan, Wener, & Harris, 2001), and ELA is a risk factor for obesity in experimental animal models and human studies(Bzostek & Beck, 2011; & Spencer, 2008; Weinberg et al., 2013). The links between ELA and increased adiposity could arise from a biologically and behavior-ally driven \"thrifty \"phenotype characterized by increased energy intake, increased storage, and/or decreased energy expenditure(Danese & Tan, 2014). Childhood stress has been linked with emotional eating and unhealthy dietary patterns (Michels et al.,2012), perhaps due to \"self-medicating \"with energy dense foods (Baldwin & Danese, 2019). Impaired reward processing and reduced self-control from ELA may lead to increased intakeof high-fat, high-sugar foods (Evans, Fuller-Rowell, & & Miller, 2015b). The neuroendo- crine pathway between ELA, obesity, and inflammation couldbe a potent one, as glucocorticoids contribute to adipose tissuedevelopment (Dallman et al., 1993) and cortisol plays a central role in regulating food intake and metabolism (Dallman, 2010; Dallman, Pecoraro, & la Fleur, 2005). Thus, early adversity expo- sure could increase the risk for children and adolescents to engagein eating behaviors that contribute to increased adiposity andinflammation. ELA could result in obesity through decreased energy expendi- ture from metabolic hormone alterations and mental health prob-lems (Baldwin & Danese, 2019). ELA is associated with changes in leptin levels, which are responsible for lipolysis (Daneseet al., 2014; Panagiotaropoulos et al., 2004). Mental health prob- lems associated with child adversity are also associated with phys-ical inactivity (Baldwin & Danese, 2019). Impaired functioning in neuroendocrine and leptin pathways could dysregulate thermo-genesis and lipolysis, decreased energy expenditureand increased adipose tissue growth (Danese & Tan, 2014). Inflammation itself can induce fatigue (Dantzer et al., 2008), and thus inflammation from ELA exposure could cyclically con-tribute to reduced energy expenditure, increased adipose tissue,and increased inflammation. Studies have found that ELA was associated with adolescent levels of inflammation only in the context of accelerated BMIgrowth trajectories (Reid et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2018). In a num- ber of studies, adiposity attenuated or abolished several of theassociations between ELA and inflammation (Matthews et al.,2014; Pinto Pereira et al., 2019), though others have found that the association between adversity and inflammation wasindependent of obesity in both adult and pediatric samples (Baldwin et al., 2018; Danese et al., 2011; Danese et al., 2020). This adversity -obesity -inflammation pathway seems to be of increased importance in studies of child-hood adversity and inflammation in adolescence. Brain functioning and behavior ELA can instantiate a chronic inflammatory state through brainand behavioral changes. The Neuroimmune Network Hypothesisoutlines the process by which ELA prompts crosstalk betweenthe neural and immune systems to create a loop of increased threatsensitivity, inflammation, and unhealthy behaviors that can resultin increased risk for chronic inflammation (Nusslock & Miller,2016). ELA is associated with impaired executive function, impaired reward processing, and hippocampal and prefrontal cor- tex abnormalities in human and nonhuman animal studies, which could lead to impaired ability to suppress unwanted behavior(Brunson et al., 2005; Danese & McEwen, 2012; Dillon et al., 2009; Matthews 2003; al., 2010; Spaete, & Feldon, 2004). Individuals exposed to ELA are at a higher risk of substance andalcohol abuse disorders (Anda et al., 1999; Dube et al., 2003), which contribute to increased inflammation (Shiels et al., 2014). Though less relevant for children, adolescence might be a salienttime for proinflammatory phenotypes to emerge due to increasesin risky behaviors, such as smoking and habits that contribute toweight gain (Raposa, Bower, Hammen, Najman, & Brennan,2014), that increase stress exposure (Lovallo, 2013; Raposa et al., 2014). Another behavioral pathway that could follow from ELA to promote inflammation is through persistent or recurring distressand self-harming behaviors. Maltreatment has been associatedwith heightened threat perception (Leppanen & Nelson, 2009; Pollak & Kistler, 2002) and heightened amygdala activation in response to negative emotional stimuli (McCrory et al., 2013; Tottenham et al., 2011). Depression and inflammation are bidi- rectionally associated in longitudinal studies of adults and adoles-cents (Matthews et al., 2010; Miller & Cole, 2012). An individual 's perception of stressors, emotional symptoms, and behavioralresponses when distressed could increase their inflammation lev-els (Danese & Lewis, 2017). An individual 's increased exposure to stressors and their emotional symptoms can further lead tochronic levels of stress and individuals may engage in self-harmto relieve feelings of distress (Baldwin, Arseneault, Caspi et al.,2019), offering another behavioral pathway by which ELS can contribute to increased inflammation. Sleep There are reciprocal links between sleep and inflammation, and wedirect the reader to a thorough review by Irwin ( 2015). Sleep can regulate the immune response: sleep disturbance has been linkedwith reduced vaccine efficacy (e.g. Prather et al., 2012;S p i e g e l , Sheridan, & Van Cauter, 2002), impaired response to infectious challenge (Cohen, Doyle, Alper, Janicki-Deverts, & Turner, 2009; Toth, 1995), and upregulation of inflammation (Irwin, 2015). Sleep influences the HPA axis, which in turn regulates the immunesystem through the diurnal cortisol rhythm (Irwin & Cole, 2011; Slavich & Irwin, 2014). In experimental and naturalistic epidemio- logical studies, sleep deprivation is associated with increasedexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and elevated inflamma-tion (Irwin, Wang, & https://www.cambridge.org/core . 03 Feb 2021 at 17:28:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use.Miller et al., 2009). Maternal separation in rodent models decreased sleep duration and disrupted sleep architecture for stress-affectedanimals (Mrdalj et al., 2013). A history of childhood trauma is asso- ciated with increased sleep problems (Gregory & Sadeh, 2016), independent of current PTSD or depression diagnoses (Noll,Trickett, Susman, & Putnam, 2006). Unfortunately, prospective evi- dence that demonstrates a mediating role for inflammation in theassociation between sleep disruptions and psychopathology is notyet available (Irwin, 2015). To our knowledge, no studies have extended this work to investigate the specific pathways betweenELA and sleep disruption as they relate to inflammation andpsychopathology. Moderation Meta-analyses of pediatric and adult populations have found het- erogeneity in outcomes in the association of ELA and inflamma-tion (Baumeister et al., 2016; Kuhlman et al., 2020). We propose three moderating factors that are currently underexamined in the literature: (a) age at inflammation assessment, (b) sex differences, and (c) population context differences. First, when are ELA 's effects on inflammation instantiated and measurable? Do inflam-matory phenotypes from ELA differ based on the timing ofimmune assessment? Second, there are questions on the timingof adversity exposure: are there sensitive periods for exposure toadversity and maximal impact on the immune system, or is acumulative model of adversity exposure most salient to impactson the immune system? Further, animals models of early lifestress and inflammation routinely find sex differences (Ganguly& Brenhouse, 2015), though few studies examine sex differences in human populations. Finally, though much of the ELA andinflammation literature has been conducted with participantsfrom Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic(\"WEIRD \") societies, a handful of studies in different country contexts paint a different picture of the associations betweenELA and inflammation. Thus, does societal context act as ayet-unexplored moderator? While studies and meta-analyseshave tested for moderation in adult samples, more work is neededto understanding how moderation functions in pediatric samples. Age of assessment More research is needed to understand how ELA across develop-ment contributes to an inflammatory phenotype and how inflam-matory phenotypes change across development. As noted, acute psychosocial stress activates peripheral inflammation and chronic psychosocial stress is associated with systemic, low-grade inflam-mation. This transition is thought to be a driver of psychopathol-ogy, especially after exposure to childhood adversity. However, itis unclear when an acute stressor becomes a chronic stressor(Rohleder, Nater, Wolf, Ehlert, & Kirschbaum, 2004), and this gap is especially prevalent in studies of children. Longitudinalassessments of inflammation over longer periods of time, repeatassessments of inflammation over a shorter window (for an exam-ple, see McDade et al., 2012), and studies on repeated acute stress might help fill this gap. As these studies do not yet exist, we reviewthe ELA and inflammation literature with a developmental lens. Adulthood. Much of the evidence linking ELA and later inflam- mation has been found in adults. Consistent with the animal lit-erature, adults exposed to childhood maltreatment are at greaterrisk of increased levels of circulating inflammatory markers(Baumeister et al., 2016; Danese & Lewis, 2017) and greaterproinflammatory responses in response to subsequent stressors (Carpenter et al., 2010; Gouin et al., 2012; Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2011). In clinical adult populations, depressed individuals with a history of ELA exhibit increased inflammatory responses toacute psychosocial stress (Pace et al., 2006) and show higher levels of inflammation in unstimulated plasma (Danese et al., 2008). Table 2 collates the studies of adult clinical populations from the Baumeister meta-analysis, specifically focusing on populationswith psychiatric diagnoses of first episode of psychosis (FEP),major depressive disorder (MDD), and PTSD as compared withhealth controls (Baumeister et al., 2016). A history of ELA appears drive increased inflammation in clinical samples (Baumeisteret al., 2016), as patients without ELA had immune profiles similar to healthy controls (Dennison et al., 2012). Further, psychologi- cally healthy controls with a history of ELA exhibited higherIL-1B compared to controls without ELA exposure (Di Nicolaet al., 2013). The Baumeister meta-analysis found that age did not have a moderating effect on the relationship between ELA and inflam-mation in adulthood (Baumeister et al., 2016). It could be possible that the moderating effect of age is most salient in pediatric pop-ulations. Alternatively, adulthood could be a life stage in whichthe cumulative effects of ELA are easier to capture throughperipheral inflammatory cytokines. One study of adults in midlifefound support for the stress accumulation model: ELA and recentlife event stressors were independently associated with higher lev-els of inflammation, controlling for each other 's effects, and their interaction was not significant (Hostinar, Lachman, Mroczek, Seeman, & Miller, 2015a). In that study, mediation analyses found that ELA and recent life stressors had unique and additivecontributions to inflammation through norepinephrine pathways,adiposity, and inflammation-inducing behaviors (Hostinar et al.,2015a). In adults, inflammation might depend on behavioral mediators rather than age. Childhood and adolescence. Descriptive analyses from the meta- analysis of ELA and inflammation associations in a pediatric pop- ulation found that adversity was positively associated with CRPwhen inflammation was assessed in adolescence, but not withIL-6 or TNF- (Kuhlman et al., 2020). A study of 1,789 female adolescents found that greater exposure to childhood maltreat-ment and victimization predicted higher CRP levels at age 18(Baldwin et al., 2018). This study included prospectively collected information from 5 to 12 years of age about ELA exposure, butthe study took a cumulative approach rather than testing ELAexposure at different developmental periods. A study of sexualabuse in a clinic setting found that individuals getting a medicalassessment for sexual abuse (occurring in the 72 hr precedingthe assessment) did exhibit higher levels of IL-6 than their non-abused peers (Kilic et al., 2017). However, the sample size was small and, while the mean age of assessment was 15 years, theage range spanned from 3 to 18 years, which makes it difficultto interpret as it pertains to time in development. Given the tem-poral proximity of the sexual abuse to the inflammation metric, itis unclear if this study is indicative of acute physical injury orchronic inflammation. The pediatric meta-analysis previously mentioned also found in descriptive analyses that ELA was positively associated withCRP when inflammation was assessed in later childhood(Kuhlman et al., 2020). Two found positive associations with mal- treatment exposure and circulating levels of TNF- , but not IL-6 (Bucker et al., 2015). In contrast, a larger study of 9-year-oldsDevelopment and Psychopathology 1611 at , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use.Table 2.

It is difficult to compare the studies, as the inflammatory cytokines and tissueselection differed. However, both studies measured maltreatmentprospectively and measured inflammation at age 9, highlightingthe need for more studies on ELA and inflammation inchildhood. Few studies have examined ELA and inflammation in infancy and early childhood but descriptive analyses from the previouslymentioned meta-analyses found that ELA was positively associ-ated with CRP in infancy but negatively associated with CRP inearly childhood (Kuhlman et al., 2020). This meta-analysis included studies with a very broad definition of ELA that arenot included in our definition of victimization. A study of salivaryCRP in 40 4-year-olds found no association between ELA andCRP, though ELA was positively associated with salivary IL-1 (Tyrka et al., 2015). In a study using dried blood spot measures of CRP, no group differences were found in CRP levels between4-6 year old CPS-referred children and low-risk children (Bernard et al., 2019). The study did find that both insecure and disorganized attachments in CPS-referred children were asso-ciated with more inflammation compared to securely attachedCPS-referred children and low-risk children (Bernard et al., 2019). The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) study, a prospective cohort study of 4,525 individualswith data on IL-6 and CRP in childhood (age 9 years), provides a wealth of longitudinal data on ELA, inflammation, and psychopathology-related outcomes. One analysis found that pro-spective measures of adversity predicted IL-6 but not CRP in9-year-olds et al., 2020). IL-6 partially mediated the rela- tionship between ELA and later internalizing symptoms (Flouriet al., 2019). However, IL-6 did not explain the association between ELA and externalizing symptoms. A separate study onthis cohort found that IL-6 levels at 9 years partially mediatedthe association between ELA in childhood and depressive symp-toms at the beginning of adolescence (Flouri et al., 2019). Internalizing symptoms at age 9 years fully mediated the associa-tion between levels of IL-6 in childhood and subclinical psychoticsymptoms (psychotic-like experiences, PLEs) at age 18 (Flouriet al., 2020). CRP was not associated with either internalizing symptoms or psychotic-like experiences. Though it is unclearhow IL-6 tracks across development, these studies provide evi-dence that that specific markers of inflammation in childhoodmediate the relationship between ELA and symptoms ofpsychopathology. Timing and duration of exposure. Cumulative adversity through- out childhood may be needed to see associations with inflamma-tion. Early intervention and removal from adversity may protectan individual from developing an inflammatory phenotype andinstead instantiate risk for psychopathology through other mech-anisms. As mentioned previously, studies of adolescents andyoung adults removed institutional care indicate no evidence ofa proinflammatory phenotype after exposure to deprivation(Reid et al., 2019; Slopen et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2018). As these studies did find changes in acquired immunity indicativeof immune senescence (Elwenspoek et al., 2017a;2017b; Reid et al., 2019), adolescence might be a time to capture early pertur- bations to acquired immunity that are either on the path to or dis-tinct from the pathogenesis of inflammation andpsychopathology. In the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parentsand Children study mentioned previously, there was also no evi- dence that IL-6 or CRP levels mediated the association betweenELA exposure in infancy and depressive symptoms in adolescence(Flouri et al., 2020). The link from ELA in infancy to depressive symptoms in adolescence was direct, and therefore elevated levelsof IL-6 in childhood partially explained the link between adoles-cent depressive symptoms from proximal childhood stressors only(Flouri et al., 2020). Thus, there may be qualitatively different pathways to depression from very early ELA exposure.Associations between ELA and inflammation may not emergewithout substantial environmental or behavioral input (Milleret al., 2011b). Future studies that address the auto-correlation of early and concurrent adversity can help tease apart how the tim-ing of childhood adversity contributes to increased risk of psycho-pathology and inflammation. Summary. What does it mean, functionally and regarding psy- chopathology risk, to have higher levels of inflammatory cyto-kines in infancy versus childhood versus adolescence? Relatively little is known about the relationship between adversity and inflammation longitudinally from infancy to adolescence. Evenless is known about the pathogenesis of inflammation fromELA in infants and young children. Thus, given the meta-analytical findings that show increased inflammation in infancy,no association in childhood, and increased inflammation in ado-lescence, it is unclear whether the association between ELA andinflammation across development is linear or nonlinear. Thismight suggest support for theoretical sensitive periods of immunedevelopment in infants and adolescents (Kuhlman et al., 2020). However, the picture becomes less clear when examining ELAexposure limited to infancy compared to cumulative exposure.Developmentally focused research is needed to understand the\"hidden wounds \"of ELA. Sex differences Experimental, nonhuman animal models suggest that early lifestress has sexually dimorphic effects on immune dysregulation(Ganguly & Brenhouse, 2015). In adult populations, a meta- analysis found no evidence of a moderating effect of sex on therelationship between ELA and inflammation (Baumeister et al.,2016). The pediatric meta-analysis was underpowered to examine sex differences. Nonetheless, the association between ELA andCRP was specific only to young women in the geneticallyinformed twin study mentioned previously (Baldwin et al., 2018). Sex differences could arise from sex differences in neuroen- docrine regulation. For example, male, not female, adolescentsexposed to violence in the past year exhibited lower cortisol reac-tivity to a laboratory stressor (Peckins, Dockray, Eckenrode,Heaton, & Susman, 2012). Sleep disruption may be another ave- nue by which sex moderates the relationship between ELA,inflammation, and psychopathology. Women appear more likelyto develop dysregulated inflammatory responses from sleep dis-turbance while men appear to be more likely to develop cardio-vascular disease and cancer, but not depression (Irwin, 2015). The field needs studies that are well-powered to examine sex dif-ferences in pediatric populations, as exposure to ELA and the bio-logical sequalae of inflammation could exhibit important sexuallydimorphic effects in humans. Ecological and demographic differences Examination of heterogeneous populations and contexts couldreveal important mechanisms of how ELA contributes to Development and Psychopathology 1613 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core . 03 Feb 2021 at , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use.inflammation and psychopathology. Many of the studies reviewed have been conducted in high-income country contexts, thoughchildren in low- and middle-income country contexts are noless exposed to ELA. However, the processes by which ELAmay instantiate inflammation might be different for children out-side of high-income country and often urban contexts. Studies inrepresentative cohorts in the Philippines, as mentioned previ-ously, and Tanzania suggest that the typical high-adversity, high-inflammation associations may be moderated by contextualfactors that are unique to high-microbial, rural, or 2013). In a pediatric population, a large study of Tanzanian children under 5 foundthat CRP was positively associated with adversity quantified asmaternal illiteracy, larger household size, and disease load(Hadley & Decaro, 2014). Interestingly, membership in the least poor wealth category was associated with higher levels of CRP.As this sample of Tanzanian children were more likely to bestunted, with an average height-for-age of 1.66, and an average CRP level of 4.4 mg/l, it is difficult to compare with the studies ofinfants conducted in higher-income countries (Hadley & Decaro,2014). However, this study points to important contextual consid- erations when researching young children, ELA, and inflamma-tory biomarkers in more diverse country contexts. Even in the context of Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic (WEIRD) societies, under-represented ethnicand race groups in predominantly white countries might experi- ence differences in context that contribute to increases in inflam- mation after ELA exposure. For example, Pereira 's analysis of the large US cohort mentioned previously found that sexual abusewas associated with all inflammatory markers in nonwhite adultsbut not white adults in the United States. IL-6 was higher by36.3% in nonwhite adults exposed to childhood sexual abuse ver-sus 9.89% in white adults exposed to childhood sexual abuse(Pinto Pereira et al., 2019). Experiences of racial or ethnic dis- crimination may constitute an aspect of child victimization orthreat perception that is currently understudied. In a study of per-ceived discrimination, there was a positive association betweenchild-reported discrimination and CRP, as measured by driedblood spots in a group of children with a mean age of 12 y(Goosby, Malone, Richardson, Cheadle, & Williams, 2015). This was a small study, but emphasizes the need to operationalize,measure, and assess how different forms of child adversity, suchas racial discrimination, can contribute to inflammatory outcomesand risk for psychopathology. Thus, specific populations mayexperience moderating factors such as discrimination in additionto the types of adversity that are typically measured in the contextof childhood adversity exposure and inflammation (Goosby et al.,2015; Pinto Pereira et al., 2019; Slopen et al., 2010). Interventions The accumulated evidence suggests that the study of inflamma- tion could help explain and plan a course of treatment for individ-uals with psychopathology after exposure to ELA. Nevertheless,there are a number of questions that can only be answered withanimal models. For example, animal models could help elucidatedevelopmental pathways from ELA and inflammation, assist inbiomarker selection, clarify tissue specificity issues. As ELA is typ-ically associated with later adversity in humans, animal modelscan help answer questions about the timing of inflammationassessment. In humans, clinical interventions can begin to addressthe heterogeneity in outcomes that might be experience- or population-dependent. Lifestyle and psychosocial interventionscan begin to clarify the outstanding questions on mediation.Here, we address some of the evidence from human interventionmodels. Clinical interventions There is still much to understand about treating inflammation- associated psychopathologies with anti-inflammatory medicationsand supplements. Experimental studies on anti-inflammatorytreatments in depression offer promise, especially in subgroupsof patients who exhibit high levels of inflammation in the casein ELA-exposed individuals with depression (Danese & Lewis,2017; McIntyre et al., 2019; Raison et al., 2013). Meta-analyses examining inflammation before and after treatment in depressed patients found that IL-6 levels decreased with antidepressanttreatment regardless of outcome, whereas elevated TNF was associated with treatment resistance (Strawbridge et al., 2015). Patients who were nonresponders had higher baseline inflamma-tion, suggesting that elevated levels of inflammation contribute totreatment resistance (Strawbridge et al., 2015). Studies of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder patients with high levelsof systemic inflammation and a history of physical abuse demon-strated a superior response to the TNF- blocker infliximab (McIntyre et al., 2019). This initial evidence points to the poten- tial benefit of pharmacological anti-inflammatory interventions inpatients 'subgroups but requires further investigation before any clinical implementation. Lifestyle interventions Beyond clinical interventions, diverse lifestyle interventions could reduce inflammation and either prevent or reduce psychopathol-ogy symptoms. Ideally, lifestyle interventions such as diet, physi-cal activity, and sleep can be tailored and used across development with minimal adverse side effects. In the last decade, numerous studies report inverse associa- tions between diet quality and depressive disorders and (Jacka, Mykletun, 2010; 2010), (Jacka et al., 2011a; Jacka et al., 2009; Weng et al., 2012), and children (Kohlboeck et al., 2012). Diet quality is associated with inflammation in population-based studies (Chrysohoou,Panagiotakos, Pitsavos, Das, & Stefanadis, 2004; Fung et al., 2001; Lopez-Garcia et al., 2004) intervention studies (Esposito et al., 2004; Watzl, Kulling, Moseneder, Barth, & Bub, 2005). These associations may be due to specific aspects of diet quality that either contribute to or protect from inflammatoryprocesses. For example, magnesium intake is highly correlated with diet quality and is negatively associated with levels of CRP (King,Mainous, Geesey, & Woolson, 2005). Omega-3 fatty acids are associated with reduced inflamma-tion (Clarke, Shipley, Armitage, Collins, & Harris, 2009; Rangel-Huerta, Aguilera, Mesa, & Gil, 2012), and a randomized controlled trial of omega-3 fatty acids found a reduction in psy-chotic disorder progression and psychiatric morbidity over a7-year follow-up (Amminger, Schafer, Schlogelhofer, Klier, &McGorry, 2015). Foods high in fiber could have positive impacts on immune functioning due to high levels of beta-glucans, phyto-chemicals, and influences on the gut microbiome (Bilici et al.,1614 B. Reid and A. . 03 Feb 2021 at 17:28:27 subject to Core terms of use.2001; Parikh et al., 2012; Tachon, Zhou, Keenan, Martin, & Marco, 2013; Volman, Ramakers, & Plat, 2008). As noted in the nutrient metabolism mechanism section, adequate iron intakeduring infancy may act as a protective factor from increased levelsof CRP in adolescence (Reid et al., 2020). In contrast, diets high in refined carbohydrates, added sugars, and trans-fatty acids areassociated with higher levels of inflammation in human and ani-mal models (Iwata et al., 2011; Levitan et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2002; Pistell et al., 2010). Saturated and trans-fat intake may increase LPS release from microbiota in the gut to promote immune sys-tem activation (Moreira, Texeira, Ferreira, Peluzio Mdo, &Alfenas studies on adversity, diet, and inflam- mation are needed in adult and child cohorts to test the impactof dietary interventions in ELA-exposed populations. Physical activity is another area of intervention. Exercise can reduce depressive symptoms (Conn, 2010) and the risk of new depressive episodes in adults (Brown, Ford, Burton, Marshall, &Dobson, 2005; Pasco et al., 2011; Strawbridge, Deleger, Roberts, & Kaplan, 2002). Physical inactivity in childhood has been asso- ciated with an increased risk of adult depression (Jacka et al.,2011c). A longitudinal study of 3,809 nondepressed men and women found that physical activity mediated the associationbetween inflammation and depressive symptoms (Frank et al.,2019). A meta-analysis of 83 studies found that exercise training was negatively associated with CRP levels regardless of the ageor sex of the individual (Fedewa, Hathaway, & Ward-Ritacco,2017). Few studies have been conducted in children, and most studies are in overweight or obese samples of children (Michigan, Johnson, & Master, 2011). Physical activity is a mod- ifiable health behavior that could be used to target inflammationand depressive symptoms. However, to our knowledge, no studieshave investigated physical activity and inflammation in the con-text of ELA. Behavioral interventions that target sleep have the potential to reduce inflammation and possibly reduce inflammatory diseaserisk in contexts of psychopathology (Irwin, 2015). Sleep health can theoretically be used to therapeutically control chronic infec-tious, inflammatory, and neuropsychiatric diseases (Irwin, 2015). Several behavioral (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia)and mind -body (e.g., tai chi and yoga) interventions have potential to modulate certain aspects of the immune functioning. For exam-ple, mind -body interventions have been found to improve insom- nia (Irwin, Olmstead, & Motivala, 2008), augment vaccine responses (Irwin, Olmstead, & Oxman, 2007), and reduce levels of IL-6 (Irwin & Olmstead, 2012), and reduce proinflammatory response gene profiles (Creswell et al., 2012). Similarly, behavioral therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis improved depressivesymptoms, reduced the stimulated production of the proinflamma-tory cytokine IL-6 (Zautra et al., 2008), and decreased levels of CRP up to a year after treatment (Irwin et al., 2014). Interventions might be specifically helpful for adolescents, as a study of 315 adolescentsfound that nightly variability in sleep duration was associated withhigher levels of CRP (Park et al., 2016). For younger adolescents, shorter average sleep duration was associated with higher CRP(Park et al., 2016). While more studies are needed in younger chil- dren and infants, this suggests that targeting sleep duration couldreduce inflammation following ELA. Psychosocial interventions Interventions to reduce the incidence of ELA itself are clearly nec- essary to reduce the rates of mental and physical illness. However,interventions in the context of ongoing childhood adversity show promise in reducing harmful outcomes. A study of positive child-hood experiences in a cross-sectional study of 6,188 adults foundthat self-reports of positive childhood experiences showed a dose - response association with lower odds of adult depression and/orpoor mental health (Bethell, Jones, Gombojav, Linkenbach, &Sege, 2019). These associations held after controlling for exposure to adverse childhood experiences, and support the prioritizationof providing children with safe, stable nurturing relationshipsfor better mental health outcomes (Bethell et al., 2019). Positive family and caregiving environments are associated with lowinflammation across a range of developmental ages. A study ininfants found that attachment security moderated the associationbetween ELA and inflammation, where securely attached infantsdid not exhibit a heightened inflammatory phenotype (Measelle& Ablow, 2018 ). As noted earlier, attachment quality in infancy has been found to predict early childhood CRP among CPSreferred children (Bernard et al., 2019). Children who had inse- cure or disorganized attachments in infancy had higher CRP lev-els in early childhood than children who had secure attachmentsin infancy, controlling for covariates (Bernard et al., 2019). Interventions such as the Attachment and BiobehavioralCatch-up (ABC) intervention have demonstrated efficacy inimproving attachment quality in families at high risk of develop-ing insecure attachment (Bernard et al., 2012), and parenting interventions early in life therefore may be a promising avenueto pursue reducing later inflammatory phenotypes. In addition to prevention, the therapeutic improvement of social support and community belonging could be promising inreducing the associations between child adversity and adultinflammatory outcomes. One study investigated whether belong-ing to the tribal community in a sample of 90 adults living on theBlackfeet reservation may moderate the relationship between ELAand levels of IL-6 and CRP (John-Henderson et al., 2020). Independent of age, gender, annual income, body mass index,and depressive symptoms, ELA exposure predicted IL-6 andCRP levels, but self-reports of belonging to the tribal communitymoderated the relationship between reports of ELA and markersof inflammation (John-Henderson et al., 2020). Outside of par- enting interventions, one study found that the presence of sup-portive role models and positive cognitive models to deal withstress may act as a buffer against proinflammatory phenotypesfor adolescents experiencing adversity (Chen, Lee, Cavey, & Ho,2013). In this study, youth with supportive role models had lower IL-6 levels. Youth who were better able to reframe stressorsa benign and better able to persisting with optimism(\"shift-and-persist \") had lower IL-6 (Chen et al., 2013). These benefits seemed to especially benefit the low-SES youth, as bene-fits were not found among high-SES adolescents (Chen et al.,2013). This study suggests that identifying psychological buffers in adolescents has could have implications for inflammation levelsand possibly mental health disparities. Despite many possible ave-nues of intervention and prevention, more research is needed inthis space and in the basic science of understanding how child-hood adversity contributes to psychopathology through inflam-matory pathways. Conclusion Exposure to ELA is a critical risk factor for the development of psychopathology, and the understanding of how early adversitygets \"under the skin \"is growing with increased research Psychopathology at , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use.biological risk for increased inflammation. Nevertheless, the het- erogeneity present in the current literature leaves many questionsand many opportunities for future research. Studies that aredevelopmentally informed and grounded in an understandingof immune- and stress-mediating systems are needed as thefield grows. In addition to population-based studies, mechanisticand experimental work is needed to understand what increasedinflammation means in the context of adversity at specific timesin development and longitudinally. In addition to a better under-standing of moderation and measurement, more research isneeded to elucidate how ELA contributes to inflammationthrough neuroendocrine dysregulation, brain functioning andbehavior, and stress-induced nutrient dysregulation. All of these possible mechanisticpathways emphasize the myriad intervention and preventionroutes that could be pursued to reduce the mental health burdenon individuals and communities that arises from the hiddenwounds of childhood adversity.
