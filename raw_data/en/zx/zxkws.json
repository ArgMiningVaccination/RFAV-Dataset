My mission in life is to give the joy of health to others by providing individualized integrative care that addresses the root causes of chronic conditions and supports the body's natural healing abilities. At Healing Arts NYC, we offer a variety of services and modalities to help you achieve optimal health and wellness, such as chiropractic adjustments, reiki, energy healing, dietary consultations, spa treatments, supplements, and tea bar. We also use a unique method called nutrition response testing, which is a non-invasive way of analyzing the body's energy and function to determine the underlying imbalances that may be affecting your health. [Nutr](/Nutrition-Response-Testing-NYC) [ition response testing](/Nutrition-Response-Testing-NYC) is based on the premise that the body is designed to heal itself, but sometimes it needs some help from specific nutrients, herbs, or homeopathic remedies to restore its balance and vitality. By using muscle testing and reflex points, we can identify what your body needs and design a personalized program that will support your healing process. Nutrition response testing can help with a wide range of health issues, such as allergies, digestive problems, hormonal imbalances, weight loss, fatigue, pain, inflammation, anxiety, depression, and more. It can also help you prevent future illnesses by strengthening your immune system and enhancing your overall well-being.
