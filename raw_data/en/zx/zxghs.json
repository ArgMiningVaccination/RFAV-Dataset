Background, upbringing, interests.... Alyssa: Oof, where to start... well, I was born and raised in Calgary, Alberta. I am a biracial adoptee and grew up pretty disconnected from my culture. So much of who I am today comes from a long journey of searching for my own identity and finding myself slowly over time. I grew up pretty religious, going to church every Sunday. So faith and ritual has always been a part of my life, in some way. I also grew up dancing competitively and playing the piano. This has kind of bled into my work now; I am inspired by capturing movement, or complementing the flow of the body. My mum is a teacher and homeschooled my two sisters and I. She imparted a love of reading and a deep curiosity for life onto me. I've always had a deep love for animals that has continued throughout my life; they ground me and make me feel whole. I ride horses in my free time, and I love being out in nature. I've been tattooing for 4 years now, almost 5 this summer. I've always been creative, but tattooing has really helped me harness my creativity and it's taken on a whole life of its own now. Gaia: What made you decide to become a tattoo artist? What is your favourite part about tattooing? Alyssa: The short answer to this is that I wanted to do something meaningful with my art. I had gone to school for graphic design and worked in advertising for a couple years, then freelanced doing illustration work. I wasn't feeling creatively fulfilled by any of these jobs and eventually quit everything to become a Barista while trying to find myself as an artist. You know, like any self respecting millennial would do. Haha. Once I got in the habit of drawing for myself every day, everything slowly started to fall into place. I started to see a style emerge. I wasn't really thinking about being a Tattoo Artist, I was just focused on showing up for my creative self. One day, leading up to my 30th birthday, I was sitting in my apartment in Calgary just looking at all my art on the walls. I think I finally got an insight into how other people might see my art - it was just a glimmer but it was enough to make me realize that I was being selfish by hoarding it all. Even though I didn't think it was ready for the world to see, maybe someone out there was ready to receive it. My close friend Sara had always been encouraging me to take up tattooing, so I decided I'd give it a shot and if it didn't work out, it wasn't meant to be. Needless to say, I'm so grateful it did work out. My favourite part about tattooing... hmm so many things. Although I'm a bit of an introvert, I love meeting new people and honestly tattooing is my most preferred way to do so. So many of my close friends now started out as clients. I find it so much easier to chat with someone when I'm working, and people seem to really open up when they are in the strange pain warp space of receiving a tattoo. My mentor Corson Hayes says when you open their skin, you also open their hearts. And I've really found this to be true. It's a very sacred exchange between the tattooer and tattooed, and I feel I am only at the precipice of understanding how healing this modality can be. I guess that's another thing I love about tattooing - I am constantly learning, constantly evolving my practice. And, really nothing beats seeing my tattoos out in the wild. I love running into clients and seeing my work out there, just living it's best life. It feels pretty surreal. I'm still not used to how insane it is that people are letting me put my art on them permanently... and I don't ever want to be used to it, honestly. Gaia: Fairy Toots is the cutest name for your tattooing practice. Do you have an affinity for folklore & mythology? Does that influence your tattoo work? Alyssa: Haha, thank you! I wanted a name that was lighthearted; I don't want to be taken too seriously. Yes, I do love folklore and mythology, even more as I get older. I grew up on Disney movies and fairy tales and I have never stop being obsessed with these things. I am a mega Disney nerd. My style is actually quite inspired by Disney, as I'm sure you can see now that I've said that! Asides from Disney though, I am very drawn to folklore as of late. Particularly Greek and Celtic, and I've been diving more into Chinese and Vietnamese folklore lately. I am half Vietnamese and half Scottish, so I've been feeling called to bring this influence into my work. This is a relatively new undertaking so stay tuned to see how (if?) it develops. Gaia: What is the most challenging thing about being a tattoo artist? Alyssa: I hold a lot of boundaries around how I work, so usually my difficulties aren't with clients or even creating the art itself. For me, the toughest thing about being a tattoo artist is actually the physical demand. It might not look it, but tattooing is pretty physically draining. It's pretty brutal for my posture; I can feel myself shrivelling more and more into a shrimp each day. We have a saying that goes \"clean lines, curved spines\"... my body really suffers in an attempt to create those crispy lines. It's worth it though, right...? Gaia: Is there a God, Goddess or archetype that you identify with, and why? Alyssa: Yes! As you know, I'm always in the store looking for Persephone related items. I love Persephone. She only came to me recently, within the past couple of years or so. My middle sister passed in 2020, and I think it was around that time that Persephone started to come up for me. My sister was born at the Spring Equinox, and she passed at the Fall Equinox. Persephone comes up from the underworld in the Springtime, and she goes back at the Fall Equinox. I have found a lot of comfort in her archetype since my sister's passing, and I really identify with her. I love that she first is the pure flower maiden, and then when she goes down into the underworld, she finds this power within herself and becomes Queen of the shadow realm. She has really taught me to go into my grief and my shadows, and own them, and love them. This is where my power is. But, she doesn't stay in that dark place; she returns to the above and spring blossoms again upon her arrival. I love this duality, how she can hold both parts of herself with love and they can exist together. She has inspired a lot of my art, especially my recent \"High Priestess\" hoodies. Gaia: Are there any other personal spiritual practices you have? Do you mind sharing about them? Alyssa: I practice tarot, although I do so in a more intuitive and less structured way. My tarot deck is the Shadowscapes deck by Stephanie Pui-Mun Law and Barbara Moore. I love this deck because it is inspired by both Celtic and Asian art, so it really resonates with me. I also like to do little rituals on the Greater Sabbats - I usually do alone or with my partner, but this year it's a goal of mine to do more rituals with friends. I used to meditate a lot, but have fallen out of a regular practice. I'm also just starting to get into evolutionary astrology, which feels like it is about to be a huge obsession of mine. I love trying to read my friends charts! Also, therapy. I know therapy is maybe considered less of a spiritual practice, but I truly believe that the two should go hand in hand. Gaia: I would agree with you that therapy is a spiritual practice :D I think that therapy is probably one of the more underrated forms of spiritual practice, personally :) We see spiritual practice as something more abstract, more fantastical, but anything that helps us become more whole is spiritual. On that note, are there any spiritual philosophies, beliefs or paths you are drawn to that you would like to learn more about? Alyssa: I first started down my spiritual path with Buddhism, as many do. I still incorporate a lot of Buddhist philosophies in my life, but lately I am most drawn to Witchcraft. I just love how personal witchcraft is, and the connection to the cycles of nature also feels really important to me. I'm interested in Taoism, but it can feel a little too abstract for me at times. Gaia: How do you think you have grown as a person in the last year? Alyssa: I feel like each year I get to know myself better, and as an adoptee, that's always been a struggle for me. I've learned to really feel through my dark and gloomy parts, and show up authentically in my relationships. Of course this is still a work in progress, but I'm getting better at it. I've also been getting more comfortable with setting boundaries; speaking up when I'm hurt, and advocating for myself. This is scary as heck, but my inner child is so happy that I'm finally listening to her. Gaia: What is one thing you would like to grow about yourself in 2023? Alyssa: For 2023 I am calling in sexual liberation and empowerment! What a big ask! But I've really been feeling lately like our true creative power lies in our sexuality. Gaia: What is your sun sign and do you feel you relate to it? If you know what your moon and ascendant signs are, do you feel like they reflect in your personality? Alyssa: This usually surprises people due to my quiet disposition, but my sun is in Aries. I do actually feel like I relate to it, although maybe not in the traditional way. My moon is in Virgo, and my rising is in Leo. I have a lot of earth in my chart, which is what most folks seem to feel from me on first impression. My Virgo moon and Aries sun seem to make me obsessed with growth; Virgo is happy to put in the effort towards change and Aries is unafraid of leading the way into the scary places. I think my Leo rising shows through my work; this is where I express myself creatively. Or, get me in the right mood on a night out on the town, and the Leo and Aries really come through. Gaia: Where can we find more information about accessing your services? Alyssa: Instagram is the best place to see what I'm up to creatively - my Instagram is @fairy.toots. If you don't have Instagram but are still interested in my work, you can email me at alyssajoy.toots@gmail.com. Gaia: What would be in your shopping bag at Gaia Rising? Alyssa: A Persephone idol please! I'm always looking for new seasonal things for my altar, too. Altar decor is my favourite! I usually buy gifts for friends from Gaia Rising, so it varies. Oracle cards, tarot decks, big pointy crystals!, books, candles. Thank you for your amazing store - it is my favourite stop on Baker :) \"An artist, a traveler, a diver, and a practitioner of magical things, Luna inspires herself by the many facets of what exactly it means to be alive. She has travelled to 33 countries, submerging herself into the culture of every place she sets foot, learning languages, participating in different spiritual practices, and experiencing the world from as many doors of perception as humanly possible.\" We carry Luna's beautiful Octopus Tarot deck at Gaia Rising & we had the pleasure of interviewing her.... Gaia: Luna! We are so excited to be interviewing you... please tell us a little bit about yourself! Luna: I grew up in Calgary on a bison farm to parents from France... so it was definitely an interesting childhood. I was a creative child, always playing make-believe and obsessed with crafts. My parents were a whole lot less enthusiastic about the countless \"murals\" my 5 year old self designed in the house, but it was pretty clear from a young age that art was my calling. As for my art career, it began 7 years ago, after a messy break-up and car crash when I had no other form of therapy. You could say art saved me in a way. I started sharing my work online and received a surprising amount of support - enough to decide to pursue it as a career. It has been a very difficult journey filled with struggles, but I wouldn't change a thing. Despite the hardships, nothing beats how rewarding it feels to pursue your dream, and to inspire countless souls around the world to do the same. I know I'm doing exactly what I'm meant to be doing. Some of my interests (outside of the obvious art and painting) are travel, SCUBA diving, psychology, plants, spirituality and cultures, learning languages, and music. Gaia: What is your earliest memory of creating art? Luna: My earliest memory of creating art is probably the Play-Doh animals I made that I was so proud of I refused to mush them back up into the containers. Unfortunately they were nowhere nearly as cute when they dried. Gaia: You have had a very interesting life, you have travelled a lot, it says in your bio 33 countries! Can you tell us about which countries have maybe been the most artistic muses & inspiration for you in your art? Luna: Every place I have been to has definitely impacted my art in some way, shape or form. Australia and the USA have been very influential through the artists I met there, the conversations we had, and the sharing of our processes. Indonesia and Egypt are two of the places I SCUBA dived the most and diving has had a major impact on my subject matter in my art. India's colors and spirituality left me overflowing with inspiration, I still have visions from that trip I haven't had the chance to paint yet. Touring Europe led me down a road of deep self discovery and inner work, which in turn has impacted my art as well. The history and ancient civilizations of South America and Egypt led me to explore more symbolism in my work. The people I met in Israel challenged me to think in new ways to create an experience from my art. Every place has left its mark, they all contribute to the way in which I create art today. Gaia: Before you became a full-time artist what did you do? Luna: I was very all over the place. I worked waitressing tables for a while, worked in a toy shop, did graphic design for all sorts of clients from dj logos to construction company business cards, I backpacked through South America doing occasional work trades and selling wire wrapped jewelry I made... Heck, I even made hula hoops and sold those on beaches for a bit. I worked retail at one point, I did photography gigs, I worked on farms, I worked making balms and creams for a small business... I've always been very \"go with the flow\". Gaia: We carry your beautiful Octopus Tarot (Which happens to be one of my favourite decks ever), how natural was it for you to blend your art with spirituality and create a spiritual tool? Luna: My art is already a very spiritual process, so it was a very natural experience. I didn't even start off trying to create a deck. I had made 8 drawings of octopuses when my friend was flipping through and said \"Luna... this is a tarot deck!\" and proceeded to name each of the cards I had subconsciously channeled. In other words, the tarot asked me to create it, not the other way around. When you \"accidentally\" create 8 cards, it only makes sense to follow the calling and complete the deck. Every card I drew, I also experienced it, not only through my own life, but through the creation of the card itself. For example, if a card embodied the energy of setbacks, the card would take forever to complete. I would struggle to find time and inspiration to work on it. And the same patterns would be reflected in my own life. Honestly it couldn't have been a more cohesive and spiritual experience. I am baffled to this day at the way in which this deck ruled my life for the entirety of its creation. Gaia: Are there any other personal spiritual practices you have? Do you mind sharing about them? Luna: I would say my art creation process itself is a major spiritual practice, and I do a lot of meditation and exploration of the spiritual realms through inner work. I also practice yoga regularly, and I try to do everything I do in life with as much awareness and intention as possible. I think you could argue that living itself is a spiritual practice if you can participate in every moment you experience consciously. Gaia: Are there any spiritual philosophies, beliefs or paths you are drawn to that you would like to learn more about? Luna: I am fascinated with so many philosophies and belief paths, although I wouldn't say there is one in particular I'm more drawn to. I'm more interested in the threads that tie together seemingly disconnected philosophies than I am in what makes them different. All walks of life and perspectives are totally valid and necessary for our highest evolution. Even seemingly opposite views are often based on very similar value systems beneath it all, but if we didn't experience separation and duality, then it would also make it very difficult to experience wholeness and unity. The whole point of the human experience, I believe, is to experience separation so we can return to wholeness little by little and get to experience it for the \"first time\" again. The stories we tell ourselves to experience this separation are fascinating, and they are beautiful. One is not better than the other. We just have to embrace the experience we are having, no matter what it may be. Gaia: How do you think you have grown as a person in the last year? Luna: My biggest growth over the last year has been very much a \"real world\" experience. I have spent so much of my life very disconnected from the way the masses operate and all the systems that are in place. This tarot deck has forced me to become more literate in the business world. As someone who functions from a very emotional way of being, the very strict and rational systems I have had to navigate have proven a challenge. Nothing has gone according to plan, I have had countless challenges, the difficulties I have faced in fulfilling the Kickstarter campaign for this tarot deck have insane amounts of backlash which has been very challenging to process. Despite all of that, this has taught me how to work WITH the systems that are in place and allowed me to grow my knowledge base. In turn, I've built a foundation that will actually allow me to step more deeply into my creative practice thanks to the automation and scalability that's possible on this foundation. Things still aren't fully resolved, but every day I get closer and I can see the freedom this last year of intensity will have created. Gaia: What is one thing you would like to grow about yourself in 2023? Luna: In 2023 I aim to deepen my understanding and ability to regulate the nervous system. I strive to be a better version of myself every single day and I believe a deeply relaxed and regulated nervous system builds foundations for me to step even more deeply into myself and my creative practice. At the end of the day though, I know whatever I am meant to work on will present itself and I'm always adapting to whatever my body and life tell me need my attention. Gaia: What is your sun sign and do you feel you relate to it? If you know what your moon and ascendant signs are, do you feel like they reflect in your personality? Luna: I am Virgo sun, Sagittarius moon, and Leo ascending. I would say I do relate to a lot of what astrology has to say about my placements. That said, I believe astrology is a great tool to understand your tendencies, but it doesn't tie you to them nor does it define you. Knowing your tendencies gives you the awareness you need in order to move past them and grow if you choose. Gaia: Where can we find more information about accessing your products and or services? Luna: The best places to follow my work are my website - www.lunacharlotteart.com - or my social media. @lunacharlotteart on Instagram, TikTok and Facebook. Gaia: What would be in your shopping bag at Gaia Rising? Luna: Last time I was in, I purchased my friend's deck, \"Beyond Lemuria\" by Izzy Ivy. It was the first time I've seen her deck in shops and I just had to grab it. I could easily bag the entire shop if I was left unsupervised with no spending limit, but otherwise, I would pick up a crystal singing bowl, a couple books, and a few crystals that I connect with. Gaia: Nadja! We are so excited to be interviewing you on behalf of Horse & Snake Vintage clothing. Tell us about the lot of you! Nadja: There are three of us. Nicole is from South Africa, Sophia is from Wales and I am from British Columbia. We met working in the service industry. Slinging beers behind a busy bar is a an effective way to learn who you can count on to match your work ethic. Bonus points if you like each other too. So we became work friends and then realized we all shared a love of beer, a dry sense of humour and the urge to skinny dip in cool water in the middle of the night. So now we're bonded for life. You know how these things go. Gaia: Where did the idea of Horse & Snake Vintage come from? Nadja: It's wild to imagine, but a year ago Horse & Snake Vintage was barely even an idea. The name definitely did not exist, nor did the thought of a brick and mortar shop. Nicole was (still is) busy running her first business The Royal, Sophia was (still is) also working at The Royal and Nelson Brewing Company and I was in need of a career change and was kicking around the idea of a vintage market stall to do something I loved and ease me into my new community (I had just moved back to the Kootenays after 6 years). I did my first market on April 16th for the opening day of the Castlegar Farmer's Market. I woke up that morning to snow on the ground and my car doors were frozen shut. The wind was so strong it kept blowing my clothing racks over sending the clothing, that I'd spent hours cleaning and steaming, crashing to the pavement. It was a disaster. Markets are hard work! A few days later Sophia told me there was a space opening up in Nelson. The Windsor Barber was moving from the sweet little space they'd been renting on Vernon St. I had zero intention of having a store and told her that but thanked her for thinking of me. She said, \"Well I've already told the landlord about you and your business and he wants to meet with you.\" I didn't want to seem ungrateful so I agreed. When I arrived at the meeting, Sophia and Nicole were there looking all business with clip boards and wearing makeup and I honestly had no clue what was happening. I faked it through the meeting and we agreed to consider a lease. After we left I was like 'wtf you guys' and they were like \"oh ya, so we're jumping on board and going to make this happen!\" I'd always wanted to be in business with these two bad asses so I was stoked! A few days later we signed a lease. A few days after that, Nicole was headed home to South Africa for a month and Sophia and I got to work on finding stock and building a social media presence. We got the keys to the space June 1st 2022 and were having our grand opening two weeks later. Exactly two months after my first market, Horse and Snake Vintage was an actual store in Nelson. What a whirlwind! Gaia: How did you come up with the name Horse & Snake? Is there is any special significance? Nadja: In the couple of weeks before my first market I was struggling to come up with a name. Before becoming my business partners they were my close friends so naturally I was bouncing ideas around with Nicole and Sophia. They told me to choose something I loved, something that was close to me. I grew up with horses and I've always been fascinated by snakes. In fact I have a horse and snake tattoo on my arm. I love the dichotomy of the two creatures. Also, horses play such an important role in Vintage. Western wear, for example, never goes out of style. My favourite piece of vintage I own is a gold snake necklace that belonged to my great-great aunt. So Horse and Snake Vintage felt perfect. I feel like it portrays our personal aesthetic of a little bit pretty and a little bit of rock & roll, with a penchant for durability. Gaia: Why did you decide to focus on vintage clothing? Nadja: In the beginning we did a lot more house wares and I wanted to do furniture as well. However, the space we were in was small and we quickly realized people were coming for the clothes so we streamlined the business to focus mainly on clothing and accessories. All three of us have had a lifelong love for vintage clothing. Using unique vintage finds to accentuate our personal style comes naturally to each of us. We all truly enjoy sharing that with other people. It makes us really happy to match different kinds of people with the pieces that speak to them. It's exciting! We focus on quality materials and well made pieces. Not only is it important to us to be resourceful and to reuse items in a world where fast fashion is negatively impacting the environment, but we believe that unique, broken in, well made garments are the most luxurious clothing to wear. Gaia: What is a clothing item or accessory that you cannot live without in your wardrobe? Nadja: I think I can speak for all of us when I say an excellent coat. Runner up would be a quality leather belt! Gaia: Are there any other personal spiritual practices you have? Do you mind sharing about them? Nadja: We subscribe to the order of the burning of the lady candle. Take that however you like. It's a long story. Iykyk (love you know you know) . As busy entrepreneurs trying to live balanced lives, we actually see very little of each other. When taking time for ourselves, Sophia and Nicole spend time outdoors with their dogs, and I with my two kids. Each of us feel deeply the need to spend time in nature in order to be able to fulfill all of our other responsibilities. Gaia: Are there any spiritual philosophies, beliefs or paths you are drawn to that you would like to learn more about? Nadja: We are all happiest in or near a lake. Skinny dipping saves lives! (When done safely and with friends. There was this one time with a cougar...) We are always learning new ways to enjoy nature. We believe Black and Indigenous lives matter and Trans rights are human rights! We're dedicated to a lifelong journey of educating ourselves and striving to be better allies while living and running a business on the traditional, ancestral and unceded homeland of the Sinixt, the Syilx and the Ktunaxa peoples. Gaia: How have you all grown in the last year? Nadja: We have come so far in the past year! We've learned so much about the business, about fine tuning our strengths and using them cohesively, about our customers and about vintage! Being your own boss is incredibly stressful but deeply fulfilling. We are just getting started! Gaia: What is one thing you would like to grow in 2023? Nadja: We're off to a great start! We moved to a bigger location on Baker Street only seven months after opening our first location. We have so many things planned for this year. There are so many projects and collaborations in the works. We are extremely excited! We can't wait to see the next year unfold as we put our plans into motion. We really love the community of artists and makers in the Kootenays and we are always looking for ways to highlight their hard work. Gaia: What are your sun signs and do you feel you relate to it? Nadja: Nicole and Sophia are both Taurus and I am a Pisces. Please pray for me.The most fun part about this venture has been making space for all three of us to explore our own creative process and finding where we overlap and how to elevate each other's creativity. We definitely butt heads too, we're not perfect. Gaia: Where can we find more information about accessing your products and or services? Nadja: We are located at 610 Baker St in Nelson, BC. ! You can find us on Instagram @horseandsnakevintage and our website is www.horseandsnakevintage.com Gaia: What would be in your shopping bag at Gaia Rising? Nadja: Tarot Cards! \"Eva Tree is a seeker and lover of life, who is passionate about nature, healing, mysticism, art, poetry, animals, human relations, and The Living Energy. She offers Shamanic Cranial-Sacral Therapy, Andean Energy Healing, Embodied Voice Alchemy, Somatic Mentorship and Coaching, Ancestral Lineage Clearing, and Star Diamond Cellular Healing. These all aim to deeply empower and increase vibrational frequencies for healing and harmonizing Body, Mind and Spirit.\" Gaia: Eva!! You have been such a lovely visitor in our store for a long time and I am so happy to finally connect with you! Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and what you do? Eva: Hello, my name is Eva Tree, and I am a seeker and lover of life, who is passionate about nature, healing, mysticism, art, music, poetry, animals, human relations, and the living energy animate within us all. I've been a professional in the Healing Arts for 23 years, with private practices in Seattle and Maui and now in Nelson, BC. I was born in the Kootenays, and the wild natural beauty of the region has deeply informed who I am. I have always been connected to animals, spirits and energies of the natural world. This communion has given me a lifelong love and abiding respect & intimacy with nature and its Elemental power. I believe in Animism, which comes from the word anima in Latin which refers to the life and soul of plants, animals, and elemental phenomena, as in wind, sun, moon and water. One of my passions is singing and after graduating from the Selkirk Music program, I was hired to join a touring band based out of New Mexico. This turned into a wild and spiritual whirlwind of touring the US for three years with a big showband. Little did I know that my journey away from my beloved mountains of the Kootenays would lead to being gone for 20 years. Gaia: You describe yourself as a \"somatic-based transformational mentor\" ... what does that mean to us average Joes? Can you tell us more about what you do and your offerings? Eva: 'Soma' comes from Sanskrit and refers to the body as distinct from the soul, mind or psyche. Within my work I seek to call forth the innate wisdom that resides within our system. This is the wisdom of the body, and it can, given the chance, bypass the constraints of the mind, and bring incredible healing and resources. This can result in profound healing and integration from past injury and trauma. This is why I say I am a Somatic based practitioner. It is my passion to support emotionally drained highly sensitive healers and artists, alchemize 'dis-ease' and pain from unresolved trauma, into vibrant health, unconditional love and heart-centered purpose. Gaia: What propelled you into becoming a healing practitioner? Was it something on your personal healing journey that pushed you to want to help others? Eva: Absolutely! I dealt with chronic pain due to TMJD dysfunction that led to headache pain and other issues and this affected my optimism and joy for life and ultimately ignited my desire to immerse myself in the healing Arts. Gaia: Can you tell us about what traditions you pull from in your healing practices and about your study/training in these practices? Eva: Yes! I am a perpetual student of life, and I am ever striving to continue my own evolution and healing. I have been in a deep dive study of many modalities including Biodynamic Cranial-Sacral Therapy, Continuum, Birth trauma resolution, Embryology, Ancestral and Shamanic healing, Trauma-informed Embodiment Coaching, Reiki and Medicine Ceremony Integration. My focus and aim are to deeply empower and increase vibrational frequencies for healing and integration of Body, Mind and Spirit. After completing the Brenneke professional Massage Therapy program in Seattle WA,I spent 5 years in mentorship with the Star Diamond Shamanic training program. I then moved to Maui, HI where I was introduced to Indigenous Kahuna wisdom of the Islands and where I first met Master plant Allies. This was a powerful catalyst for healing and transformation and opened a portal to Andean Mysticism. The Andean Cosmo-vision took root and flowered in my heart, and for the past 7 years I have been a passionate student and practitioner of these ancient wisdom ways. Gaia: Do you have a favorite modality in your repertoire that you like to work with most personally? Eva: I always bring everything I do to the table and seek to meet people where they are at, but lately I am particularly interested in Andean healing techniques and Shamanic energy work, as it is very complimentary with Cranial Sacral Therapy. Gaia: Are there any other personal spiritual practices you have? Do you mind sharing about them? Eva: I have many! Mostly it has to do with a daily communion with Pachamama, Mother Earth, Gaia, Madre Tierra. I make offerings everywhere I go in Nature. I seek communion and allyship with Sacred Nature to remember my own sacred Nature. I offer Despacho (a ceremonial mandala) to honor rites of passage and to seek support and guidance when needed. I am a ceremonialist which means I love to offer these earth honoring ways to others and co-create rituals for abundance, healing and more. Gaia: Are there any spiritual philosophies, beliefs, or paths you are drawn to that you would like to learn more about? Eva: Yes, and Yes! I am very passionate about Andean cosmology. I am a Mesa (Medicine) carrier of the Rainbow Lineage, as received by Maestro Puma Fredy Quispe Singona of Chinchero, and I also carry a Mesa in the Pachakuti Mesa tradition of Maestro Don Oscar Miro-Queseda. This year long mentorship I received here with community members Robin Flynn and Darcy Copas and the beautiful vision they hold with Star River Sanctuary. I am ever grateful for the beautiful work they are introducing to the Kootenay region! I've also studied Hampeq-healer techniques with respected healer Vilma Pineda and most recently completed a 6 month Paqo (healer) training with the Andean Mystical School. I am currently a teachers Assistant with Maestro Puma Fredy Quispe Singona in a year long program titled, 'Peruvian Healing Practices and Sacred Ceremonial Service Immersion.' This is presented through The Shift Network and is absolutely amazing! Gaia: What is one thing you would like to grow about yourself in 2023? Eva: Well, growth for me in the last year has been very exponential! I plan to travel to Peru in October, so I know that I am in a big cycle of catching up to the frequency and ceremony of life. In other words, my Spirit and soul have made huge strides in frequency and now my body is catching up. This brings such joy and liberation and is truly what I am passionate about with supporting others. Gaia: Where can we find more information about accessing your products and or services? Eva: You can find more about me at [https://www.treestarhealth.com/](https://www.treestarhealth.com/) I love bringing voice, creativity, ceremony and play to each custom created session. I am deeply committed to living an embodied life of 'Ayni'-sacred reciprocity, in communion with all of nature and in service to my community. For me, this concept of reciprocity has been a game changer, and I want to share this with my clients. Gaia: What would be in your shopping bag at Gaia Rising? Eva: I love Gaia Rising and even your name says it all! Now is the time to raise our Earth consciousness for sustainability and future generations. I love to wander your store and am especially drawn to the crystals, oracle decks and beautiful jewelry. I love wearing gemstones because you can program them for deep healing, protection, and insight. I feel connected to and grateful for Gaia Rising as it connects with my love of music, art and healing modalities all aligned with the heart-centered vision of creating a sustainable and regenerative earth honoring culture of love. I believes that by honing all the senses to deeply listen, sense and perceive, we can facilitate a profound activation of the innate and miraculous intelligence within us all, and remember our true nature in harmony with all of creation with a responsibility to be stewards of the living Earth-Pacha Mama. I'm passionate about sharing my tools with others as a vehicle for awakened consciousness and I am deeply honored to offer my services to the Nelson community. With love and respect, Eva Gaia: Nadine, we are so happy to be interviewing you!! Tell us a little bit about yourself! Nadine: I have been living in Nelson for 15 years now and was a Floral Designer for well over 20 years. In 2017 I completed my Yoga Teacher Training at Bambu Hot Yoga Studio with local teachers Stacey Arseneau and Kaila Kaufman. I was feeling called out of the retail industry into a different kind of service. My interest in Sound Healing, Nada Yoga & mantra came before my Yoga Teacher Training and in the end it was what helped me to become the teacher I am today. Living in downtown Nelson, I opened up my apartment studio to teach Yoga and host conscious events. This birthed my offering of Community Yoga, the Kootenay Kirtan Collective, house concerts, artist/yoga practitioner collaborations & sound healing meditations. I am currently involved with the Community Futures program about to launch my first studio; SOMA Sound & Events. Gaia: When did you start your Yogic path & practice? Nadine: My Yogic path began in 1999 when I took my first Yoga class, from there my practice came and went. In 2007 I immersed myself in a month of hot yoga and fell in love with the depth of my practice. In 2008 I moved to Nelson and attended a few local classes. Then in 2010 I gave birth, my Yogic path shifted into single motherhood. When my daughter was 3 a friend gifted me $100 and said make sure you spend this on yourself. I invested in a pass at Bambu. I needed Yoga to survive and thrive. It was proving to me it was essential for my mental health. I then arranged with Kaila Kaufman (owner/teacher at Bambu) a Karma Yoga trade. I cleaned the studio to have a regular practice, which led me to deepen my study; hence the Yoga Teacher Training which has brought me to who and where I am today. Gaia: At what point in your life did you decide that it was your true calling to become a yoga teacher and open a space to teach people? Nadine: Yoga changed everything in my life, my mental health improved so much, I quit smoking, my health was improving, I wanted to simply share the benefits of the practice. Once I completed my teacher training, what I thought would be simply a personal investment, became a ripple effect into the world. Mantra, Sanskrit, Self study, Yogic philosophy, I felt called to share my experiences and be of service to amplify the healing power of this journey. I was struggling with working in the retail floral industry. What I once thought I would die doing became more difficult to go to everyday because my soul work was calling me. So I played in both worlds until the pandemic created a lay off scenario which opened the doors to pursue creating a career in the realm of sound & frequency healing, yoga and conscious events. Gaia: Tell us a bit about your space 'Soma Yoga Studio' and what you offer as far as lessons and events. Nadine: So to clarify, SOMA is not a Yoga Studio. Rather it is a studio for the healing arts & conscious events. It is a platform for Complimentary Alternative Medicine (CAM), energetic based practices, Sound Healing, Music Medicine, somatic and ancient movement practices, pranayama and meditation classes, workshops & or events. It is functioning a bit like what our Moving Centre did; it provided a space for a variety of practitioners to offer their classes, workshops, & events. SOMA is a bit more curated in a way, seeking teachers and practitioners that support the growth of CAM, energy medicine and medical intuition. The mission is to empower the inner healer within all of us. Whether that is learned from a weekly pranayama practice, a seminar for those interested in Tai Chi, a workshop series on the power of sound. It will be interesting to see what work comes through to be supported. Gaia: What does yoga offer you that other spiritual practices don't? Nadine: Yoga opened me to the divine within myself. Learning that self love and self compassion can only extend outward to others once found within oneself. The practice of chanting (mantra & learning Sanskrit) has given me probably the most powerful transformation. Finding my voice, recognizing the power of vibration was a calling to share this medicine with the world. I wish to empower people in their voices, giving them a platform to speak and share their truths in relation to the healing arts and the evolution of consciousness. Gaia: Are there any other personal spiritual practices you have? Do you mind sharing about them? Nadine: Prayer. Gaia: Are there any spiritual philosophies, beliefs or paths you are drawn to that you would like to learn more about? Nadine: I am feeling drawn to Tai chi, Qi Gong, Energy Medicine and Medical Intuition. Gaia: How do you think you have grown as a person in the last year? Nadine: I have grown in so many ways. Having gone through the Community Futures program, I have learned so much about what I am capable of, how passionate I am to bring a vision to life. My belief in myself & in my dreams is so powerful that I feel like I am capable of experiencing magic in the everyday. I am making amazing new connections and the synchronicities are an affirmation that I am on the right path working with the right people. Gaia: What is one thing you would like to grow about yourself in 2023? Nadine: I wish to strengthen my inner knowing always. Having the radical trust to follow what feels right. Gaia: What is your sun sign and do you feel you relate to it? If you know what your moon and ascendant signs are, do you feel like they reflect in your personality? Nadine: I am an Aquarius and I definitely resonate with the Aquarian vibes. I am a Taurus rising and a Taurus moon. I suppose I am fairly grounded in this lifetime. Gaia: Where can we find more information about accessing your services? Nadine: @somasoundstudio on IG. SOMA Sound & Events page on FB. People can join my email list for upcoming events and updates at somasoundstudio@gmail.com and eventually I will have my website up and running. It is under construction currently. I hope to have it soon so scheduling and booking will be easier for all. Gaia: What would be in your shopping bag at Gaia Rising? Nadine: A lovely piece of amethyst for my studio! Gaia: Aimee, such a pleasure to be interviewing you! Please tell us a little bit about yourself. Aimee: I'm a born and raised Nelsonite; my mother was born in Nelson and my father was from Berlin, Germany. My father was big into gardening and loved animals, we had a goat, chickens, and dad even bred fish in our basement at one point. We lived in Bonnington when I was really young and one of my fondest memories was walking over to visit the neighbour's horses to feed them apples and carrots. I'm so grateful for my exposure to nature as a child because it inspired me to be curious and to appreciate this crazy interwoven world. Being present outside in any environment brings me great peace. The sounds, smells, textures and energetic movement reminds me that we're more than just ourselves; we're part of a whole. I'm constantly in awe of the natural world that surrounds us and, likewise, am also constantly frustrated as to why our current day societal structure doesn't honour and respect it more. My professional background is actually in video production and photography, which has provided me with the skills to document nature. I take A LOT of flower photos, haha. Why not? They're so beautiful and their presence is often fleeting, so being able to capture them in a photo allows their beauty to live on forever. I've also completed the Gaia College certificate for Organic Horticulture Specialist, which gave me excellent footing in how to promote healthy soil life. Total game changer for anyone who wants to grow a productive garden. Gaia: What made you decide to become a gardener-florist and create beautiful bouquets? Aimee: My inspiration to grow flowers comes from my upbringing and definitely from my father's love for all things flowers. My father, Bernd, had a long battle with cancer. When his journey became terminal, my husband and I moved in with him to help out. During that time we spent many days in dad's garden which allowed us to deeply bond. After my father passed, we inherited his home (which dad built himself) and decided to build more garden beds in his honor. It was my way of processing the grief, so I lovingly refer to it now as my \"grief garden\". I hear dad's voice, in his strong German accent, every time I'm out there. Usually he's chastising me for working too hard but a lot of the time he's also reveling in the beauty with me. I guess I thought \"If flowers can bring me so much joy, why shouldn't I share them? Maybe they'll feel the same joy I do.\" Gaia: What do you mean by 'Micro Flower Farm'? Aimee: A micro flower farm is basically a farm that operates on anything less than five acres of land. Usually producing on this level means you're doing everything by hand with no heavy duty equipment (ie: tractors etc). It's small scale, high-yield and operating with sustainability in mind. I use regenerative practices to ensure soil health, so no artificial fertilizer, pesticides, herbicides, or fungicides are ever utilized. Instead, I work with nature and try to mimic what nature would do. I try to make my own natural inputs, either from plants I've harvested and distilled or compost we've aged. If we don't have enough of our own compost available, then we source organic matter from other local farmers. I just love the reciprocal circle of death into what feeds life; nothing is wasted and everything is reborn. Why throw synthetics into something that is already so poetic and purposeful? Gaia: What does 'Die Blute' mean and why does it have significance to you? Aimee: Die Bl\u00fcte (pronounced Dee Bloot) is German and translates to \"the blossom\". I wanted to honour my German heritage in our farm's name and chose Die Bl\u00fcte because I liked it's double meaning. Yes, it's related to flowers, but to blossom also means to come into your own. When a person blossoms they become stronger, more confident, which results in feeling really good about themselves. It felt like a positive message and one that resonated with me. I know it's a hard name for people to pronounce, but so is my last name, Boehmke (pronounced Boom-caw). Pretty much just staying on theme, haha. Gaia: Have you ever explored the language of flowers? Where each flower signifies an important message and where they are given accordingly? Like yellow roses being 'Unrequited love'? Aimee: Ah yes, Floriography; The language of flowers. I'm definitely a fan and usually incorporate it into my bouquets. Whenever I do a custom order, I give the option to include a card that contains the meanings for the flowers in the arrangement. It's just fun and interesting, people really seem to enjoy the messages! It's especially popular for wedding bouquets. I have three different Floriography books that I pull information from. I recommend having multiple sources to cross reference, it provides a much more in depth description for the meanings. Often flowers have multiple meanings, so having more reference guides is beneficial for getting the full picture. My top two recommendations are The Complete Language of Flowers, by Theresa Dietz (which includes the most lovely illustrations), and Flowerpaedia by Cheralyn Darcey. The latter book is compact with succinct descriptions that you can search either by the meaning you want to express, or by the flower itself. Very handy. Gaia: What are your top 5 flowers? Aimee: Haha, that's like asking a parent to pick their favourite child! Instead, I'll provide you with my favourite flowers by meaning... Dahlias Meaning: Dignity, Elegance, Eloquence, Good Taste, Confidence, Vitality, Inner-strength, Generosity, Creativity, Faith, Resiliency, Warning of Change. Often the message behind dahlias is \"You can do this\". It's a very encouraging flower and makes a great gift for anyone experiencing difficult change, it helps to bolster confidence. Cosmos Meaning: Balance, Harmony, Peace, Tranquility, Orderly, Beauty, Love, Coherency, Communication. Cosmos bring joy in love and in life, it basically is saying \"No one could love you more\". It's recommended to arrange Cosmos in your home if you need to restore spiritual or emotional harmony. It amends discord. Lily Meaning: Birth, Devotion, Divinity, Honor, Humility, Purity, Modesty, Magnificence, Unity of Heart. Lilies bring out the truth and promote long lasting partnerships. It also carries the message of \"I am proud of you\". It helps repel negativity and unwanted visitors. It can be used to exorcise bad energy and fend off malicious ghosts. It's also a symbol of fertility. Phlox Meaning: Unanimity, United Hearts, Agreement. Phlox speaks to the uniting of souls, its message is \"I think we can be friends\". It can be used in spells with the intention to build heartfelt relationships. Daffodil/Narcissus Meaning: Chivalry, Clarity of thought, Contentment, Forthrightness, Forgiveness, Rebirth, Self-esteem, Self-love, Respect, Renewal. Narcissus brings awareness to your ego and where it may've gotten in the way. On the other side of having too much ego, it supports those who may be too self-deprecating. Wear narcissus over your heart for good luck in new beginnings or in times when you need to stand up for yourself. Gaia: Are there any other personal spiritual practices you have? Do you mind sharing about them? Aimee: Spirituality, to me, is wherever you find connection, peace and the intention that you're doing good in the world (perhaps with the sense that it's guided by a greater force). For me that is in my garden. I connect with the Earth, it brings me peace to feel like I'm a part of something bigger than myself, and I feel like I'm doing good by supporting the ecosystem. It also feels like I was destined to have my hands in the dirt and to be up close with nature in some way or another. So, I guess you could say my garden is kind of like a place of worship. Also, dancing. I like to dance and that seems like a bit of a spiritual celebration thing. I sometimes do that in the garden. My neighbours probably think it's hilarious because I'm usually wearing headphones and can't hear what I'm listening to. Gaia: Are there any spiritual philosophies, beliefs or paths you are drawn to that you would like to learn more about? Aimee: Definitely a big believer in karma, you get back what you give. I often think about reincarnation and really hope I come back as a bird. Who wouldn't love to be able to fly?! I have a lovely relationship with the birds in my yard. The crows especially are a riot, we have conversations back and forth. I call them the \"party birds\". Gaia: How do you think you have grown as a person in the last year? Aimee: I've learned a lot in terms of where I want to place my energy. As you can imagine, farming everything by hand (even on a small scale) is physically exhausting. As people, we only have so much energy in a day that we can spare. Some of that gets used up doing day-to-day things like feeding ourselves. Some of it goes to forming or maintaining relationships. Imagine if 75% of it went only to farming?! That's nuts. So, basically I'm learning balance and limitations. Also, because I rely on things outside of my control (aka the weather), I've learned to accept that which I cannot control. Gaia: What is one thing you would like to grow about yourself in 2023? Aimee: I'd like to practice more mindfulness. I'm constantly trying to bring myself back to the present. As a farmer, we often have to plan way in advance of things, so it's very easy to slip into what I call \"future mode\" which tends to produce racing thoughts. Let's just say I plan to enjoy my gardens more this year, rather than fret about the things that are out of my control (I'm looking at you, weather). Gaia: What is your sun sign and do you feel you relate to it? If you know what your moon and ascendant signs are, do you feel like they reflect in your personality? Aimee: I'm a Gemini sun, Libra moon and Scorpio rising. I'm so stupidly a Gemini Sun, haha. I'm constantly analyzing, mimicking, adapting and learning. I process information really quickly and apply what I learn immediately. This is one of my more favorable traits (lets just forget about the other more changeable feelings that come with being a Gemini, haha). I also resonate with my Libra moon. It seems to be in perfect harmony with my Gemini sun, always balancing things and finding the ability to argue both sides. Unfortunately, this makes me incredibly indecisive and a bit of a people pleaser. However, then Scorpio comes in with the intuition and as I get older I'm learning to trust that gut of mine more. My Scorpio rising also makes me very comfortable transforming and I think provides me with acute skills of perception. I often spend time alone and tend to be private and protective of who I let in my life. On the outside I believe I present as outgoing, easy-going and agreeable but for those who know me well, they get to see the contemplative, dark and disarmingly honest side. An astrologer once described my Sun, Moon and Ascendant placements as \"Cute, cute, don't F$%# with me\". I thought that was pretty funny and yet terrifyingly accurate. Gemini is goofy and fun, Libra is friendly and fun, then Scorpio rising makes me tenacious to a fault. Gaia: Where can we find more information about accessing your products and or services? Aimee: The best place to keep tabs on my offerings is via my Instagram account, @die.blute. If you don't use Instagram, I also have a Facebook page (Die Bl\u00fcte Florals). This year is especially exciting; I'm stepping away from doing full season bouquet subscriptions and offering more floral arranging workshops! If you were to peruse either my IG or Facebook accounts, you'll quickly discover that I'm really into arranging flowers. I find the process to be meditative and I love sharing techniques with others. I'm hoping to offer 2-3 workshops this year; for sure one at the end of July and another at the end of August. Gaia: What would be in your shopping bag at Gaia Rising? Aimee: Oh, all sorts of things! Probably a tarot deck centered around the meaning of flowers. Most likely some crystals that invoke a sense of focus and grounding energy. Also something I can enjoy that enhances my immediate atmosphere on a sensory level, like wind chimes. Danu is a beautiful Goddess-Witch whom we feel very connected to at Gaia Rising.... \"I am always so impressed with how every tarot reader has their own, unique approach to reading. Everyone has their own style! But if you like a little bit of a slap in the face (in the kindest way possible) Danu's readings will really set you straight if you are floundering. At times, I personally fall into the trap of being too much in my head. Danu's reading reminded me in a direct way to take responsibility for the situation I was inquiring about! Danu is definitely gentle & feminine, and the information is communicated with the utmost respect & love, but me, being a Sagittarius myself, can appreciate the blunt & traditional delivery of information. I highly suggest booking with Danu!\" -Dannika Soukoroff (Gaia Rising) Gaia: We are so excited for our Sagittarian Download! Tell us a little bit about yourself Danu.... Danu: I'm Danu. I'm also known as Danie (Jeanes). Danu is the name of the Irish Mother Goddess (akin to Gaia) and is a nick-name gifted to me by high school friends for my incessant Mothering and relentless pursuit of Motherhood as my prime purpose in life :) I'm a BC girl - grew up in the lower mainland, went to a Fine Arts School, and have been coming to Nelson to visit my Dad (and do summer theatre at The Capitol) every holiday since he moved here when I was 3. I moved to Nelson from Victoria in 2012 and was a co-parent of Raw Magic Chocolate (a hand-made chocolate company featuring \"fortune cards\" in every bar) till 2018 - you may have seen me at the local markets. I'm a straight-shooting Tarot Reader ;) Offering various readings in person around Nelson or virtually. My readings are \"Sagittarian Downloads\", meaning they're to-the-point/frank - sometimes they deliver a \"cosmic bitch slap\" if you need it. Hence, Tarot reading business name is Sagittarian Download. I'm also a fabulous Spa Therapist at Aura Spa in The Hume Hotel. Gaia: How old were you when you started reading tarot? Danu: I was gifted my Tarot deck (the one I use for readings for others) when I was about 8. I had been scoping out the decks at Dragon Space on Grandville Island (Vancouver) with my Dad and had chosen The Tarot of the Old Path as my favourite. It arrived anonymously in the mail awhile later, but wrapped in a donuts bag so I knew it was from my father. He always had a Raider-Waite deck that we would play with - sometimes for divination, sometimes just pulling out the \"pip\" or minor arcana cards to play card games with. He told me that his grandmother (from Northern Ireland) read Tarot cards, using the Raider-Waite, and always kept a Bible on top of them to keep evil spirits out of them.... A practice I have not continued, though I do keep my cards wrapped in silk, and regularly cleanse them with sage, to the same effect. Gaia: What was your learning process in learning to read the cards? Some people read solely intuitively without focusing on the historical or fundamental meanings of the cards, what has been your approach? Danu: My first deck came with a book that I used to learn some basic spreads and translate the cards when I drew them. I drew daily cards and did readings like that (using various books for definitions) for myself and others for a decade before I realized that I had their meanings memorized and could very proficiently read without aid from a book. The books I studied were mostly (though not all) traditional in their definitions of the cards. I also learned a lot by receiving readings from others and having great conversations with more experienced readers. My Dad also shared what he remembered of his grandmothers interpretations - which were very literal and traditional. I once had a Medium tell me that she could see my father's grandmother standing by my right shoulder when I read my cards, telling me their meanings. Now I'd say that the cards \"speak\" to me - I hear their meaning for each individual in each particular reading in a Clairaudiant way. It's generally very clear, concise, even blunt in it's messages. Gaia: Are there any other personal spiritual practices you have? Do you mind sharing about them? Danu: I'm a Celtic Pagan/eclectic Witch, so I celebrate the 8 seasonal Sabbats around the Wheel of the Year (Solstices, Equinoxes and the points between) with my family, close friends and community. I usually celebrate the Full Moon with a Circle of like-minded ladies, or my partner and kids. I love ritual and community celebration as ceremony. Daily: I pick cards to focus on what I'm evolving in myself that day, and do a quick meditation, grounding and protection ritual (I've got a 14 month old so these daily this don't always happen atm). I also try to take a moment of gratitude before eating a meal. The Hawaiian tradition of \"Honoponopono\" is one of my all-around favourite adopted practices for anything and everything: \"I love you, I'm sorry, Please forgive me, Thank you\". Also, the affirmations by Louise L. Hay have been transformative in various aspects of my life. Gaia: Are there any spiritual philosophies, beliefs or paths you are drawn to that you would like to learn more about? Danu: Truly, I just want to re-study everything I've dabbled in so far! I've been a student of Witchcraft and the occult for most of my life, I'm an Initiated Pagan Priestess, but I've been a dedicated Mother as well for the past 18 years so the bulk of my formal study is now getting a bit faded... I want to re-read some Starhawk, Z. Budapest, Scott Cunningham and DJ Conway, as well as delve deeper into Runes with Dawn Ravenwind's \"The Illustrated Book of Runes\" (This book is stocked at Gaia Rising) and the formal roots of Wicca with Gerald Gardner and Dion Fortune. Gaia: How do you think you have grown as a person in the last year? Danu: 2022 was my year of Maternity leave with my last child, that's what gave me the space to fully come into giving Tarot Readings professionally with Sagittarian Download. That's been huge. I've been giving readings as gifts ect. for 20+ years and it feels SO GOOD to now be promoting and offering my skill to my local (and world - thanks to the internet) community. Gaia: What is one thing you would like to grow about yourself in 2023? Danu: Having my third child has brought me a sense of completion in the child-bearing part of my Mothering destiny. Now I'm stoked (really for the first time in my life) to focus on prosperously supporting my family with my skills. Gaia: What is your sun sign and do you feel you relate to it? If you know what your moon and ascendant signs are, do you feel like they reflect in your personality? Danu: I'm a Sagittarius (how'd you guess?!?!) and I'm pretty typical - fiery, honest to a fault, fun-loving and flirtatious. My Ascendant is Aquarius - which is why I stick out like a sore thumb in any crowd and am \"such a hippie\", and my moon is in Cancer - hence the Mama focus. Gaia: Where can we find more information about accessing your products and or services? Danu: You can find me @Sagittarian_Download on Instagram and Facebook. My business card and menu/price list are at Gaia Rising. Or you can just call/text me directly at 1-778-962-0989. I offer various readings, all at about $11 per card, as well as gift certificates. Gaia: What would be in your shopping bag at Gaia Rising? Danu: OOOOO! Jewelry! So much jewelry! And I love those Lunar Intention journaling sheets from November Wild (You can find these in our Witchcraft section at Gaia).... And I've always wanted that big, rainbow, meditating cat statue that you have in there..... "}
