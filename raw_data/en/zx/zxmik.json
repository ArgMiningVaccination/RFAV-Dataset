What we in the developed countries often forget is that for most people on the planet, these discussions are worlds apart from their daily lives. Two thirds of the global population live in countries without press freedom. Journalists and bloggers in Ethiopia and Belarus, for instance, have different challenges to tackle than their colleagues in the German or British media. They often must struggle to set up the basic structures for produc - ing media, obtaining sheer access to relevant informa - tion and investments in. Some facehostility due to their journalistic approach. With its second Global Media Forum, Deutsche Welle made a contribution to bridging this gap by bringing together 1,200 participants from approximately 100 countries to the World Conference Center in Bonn. Representatives from the media, politics, business and academia focused on \"Conflict Prevention in the Multi - media Age\" - regardless of borders and communication tools. One outcome that makes me and all of the people involved in the conference very proud is that we have ef-fectively overcome the struggle between traditional and new media. The lively debates at the Deutsche Welle Global Media Forum have shown the only possible way ahead: News and information - no matter how it is dis - tributed - must live up to clearly outlined quality stan - dards. Well-researched, verifiable and reliable content is just one side of the communication coin. Responsible professionals must also honor journalistic impartiality and contribute to conflict prevention and containment. With this momentum I want to invite all media producers to tackle further crucial global problems, for instance climate change. How can the media, the people producing news, weblogs, TV and radio programs, help remedy global warming? The heat is on. At Deutsche Welle's third Global Media Forum from June 21-23, 2010, in Bonn, we want to focus on how to handle this and make our planet a place worth living on. I invite all of you to join us in that essential discussion. Erik Bettermann Bonn, August 2009We live in turbulent times. New interactive technologies for information exchange are rapidly transforming the tra - ditional media landscape in many parts of the world. The immediate consequences of these dynamics are perhaps nowhere more serious than in those fields related to conflict and violence. In fact, to an increasing extent new infor - mation and communication technologies determine our very perception of political unrest and human suffering in distant places. As aptly illustrated by the recent demonstra - tions in Iran, the majority of news items was produced by non-professional eyewitnesses using twitter and YouTube - rather than trained journalists. In Africa, the number of mobile phone users has been estimated to be increasing by 35 percent every year. How can such developments be strategically harnessed for the purpose of facilitating non-violent conflict resolution and peaceful coexistence? As an independent research institute, the Bonn Inter - national Center for Conversion (BICC) has been explor - ing opportunities for conflict prevention and post-conflict reconciliation for the past 15 years. Having already cooper - ated with Deutsche Welle in documenting last year's Global Media Forum, we are thus very happy to - once again - support the 2009 conference on \"Conflict Prevention in the Multimedia Age\". I thank and congratulate everyone who participated in its successful realization. Most certain - ly, the Global Media Forum has by now established itself as an important international platform for promoting regular dialogue on relevant and timely issues between journalists, academics, business representatives, and peace practitioners from all over the world. The following documentation collects and summarizes the main topics and recommendations of this year's dis - cussions. Not least, it points to many possibilities of how multi-media technologies can bridge cultural divides, raise public awareness and synchronize diverse peacebuilding activities. With this in mind, I hope you will enjoy read - ing this documentation and draw some inspiration from it. I look forward to cooperating with Deutsche Welle on similar projects in the future. Peter J. Croll Bonn, July 2009ForeWorD erik betterM ann, Director General, Deutsche Welle, Germany Peter J. c roll , Director of the b onn i nternational c enter for c onversion ( bicc ), Germany Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009ForeWor D 11 10instead of integrated solutions to managing crisis infor - mation. As Choi demonstrated, this can be the product of a long history of organic growth of these organiza - tions and of the necessities faced by them when operat - ing across multiple countries and multiple regions to respond to varying situations. However, he also showed that advances in technology and improvements in our ability to communicate with one another have provided opportunities to collaborate more effectively and - what is even more important - to bring more integrated ap - proaches to bear on the use of information to prevent, respond to, and recover from crises. In fact, Choi presented an initiative of his own of- fice, in collaboration with the ICT for peace foundation (ICT4peace), which is currently leading an effort with key stakeholders in the field and the headquarters to formulate such an integrated approach. This initiative is expected to produce significant improvement in the overall crisis management capability of the international community. An initial stock-taking exercise of the cur - rent situation has already been conducted. Since then, a group of information management and technology specialists have been charged with the development of an integrated approach. Choi explained that they are focus - ing on four fronts: \u00b7Information architecture: Define, gather and set up critical information needed during conflicts and crises; \u00b7Technology development initiative: Create inter- operable systems activities: Enhance the interna - tional communities' overall human resources and technical capacity to deal with conflicts and crises; \u00b7Outreach efforts: Increase the outreach of the new approach to a broad spectrum of stakeholders in both the public and private sector.Continuing, Choi discussed how such technicali - ties are relevant to the Global Media Forum. The suc - cess of such an endeavor, he said, will have incredibly far-reaching implications for the United Nations and other actors in the field. For example, streamlining and standardizing the way critical information is collected and shared prior to and during a conflict could lead to more effective decision-making and timely delivery of essential services to those in need of help. Availability of credible, accurate, complete, and timely information could also contribute to improving public communica - tion and journalistic reporting. With the improved qual - ity of information, fundraising efforts that depend on broad public awareness and support could produce better results. Finally, with more complete accessible data, post-conflict events reporting and evaluation could be fact-based and transparent. Particularly, he emphasized that integrated strategies mean that citizens, the media and organizations alike can use and feed-in important real-time data during the crisis as well. The Office of Information and Communications Technology (OICT) has, for example, been liaising with a small organiza - tion called Ushahidi, which arose in response to the 2008 post-election crisis in Kenya, to enhance real-time reporting based upon crowd-sources. The same tool was deployed by Ushahidi in response to the 2009 election in India as well as the recent H1N1 virus epidemic, and he expects such examples to become increasingly fre - quent as more and more people gain access to Internet and mobile technology in remote areas of the world. At the same time, Choi noted, it is important to take into account the fact that traditional communication chan - nels as basic as radios are still very much part of how information is communicated during crises in some parts of the world. In this regard, the UN integrated approach to crises management would attempt to support a range of solutions, both high-tech and low-tech, especially for challenging environments where high-speed connectiv - ity is unavailable. Concluding, Choi emphasized the unique role the United Nations can play in uniting disparate actors and solutions across various sectors of society. In order to suc - ceed in this endeavor, learning about and practicing new multimedia tools, as well as discussing new ideas at such forums as provided for by this conference, are necessary and highly welcome, he said. Finally, he congratulated the organizers on their choice of the conference topic. Since the world of multimedia is in transition, it is increasingly obvious that transition will have a major influence on the future of the media's information creation, delivery and management. In this regard, the broad-based discussions, which he anticipated would take place at the conference, not only promised to deliver fruitful results but also to tackle an important emergent issue. Soon-Hong Choi opened his speech with an illus - tration of the global changes introduced by modern information technology (IT) within a short period of time. Many young people now connect with each other via instant mobile phone messages and facebook; GPS significantly extends the freedom of movement also of elderly people; small-scale producers in developing countries can sell their locally manufactured commodi - ties directly to people all over the world via the Internet; and e-bay and other option sites enable the selling and purchase of all kinds of goods and services more easily, more cheap and faster than ever. \"That's IT\", he said. New information technology and new media solutions have woven themselves into a fabric over what we do, from all sides, whether it is social engagement, economic development, humanitarian assistance-, or even UN peacekeeping missions. Turning to the role of the United Nations, he highlighted the considerable progress made, not just in recognizing but in institutionalizing the power of infor - mation technology. Never before has information tech - nology been as visible and well-positioned as a driver for change within the global institution as it is today, he stated. The main challenge identified for the United Nations and for all other stakeholders, Choi argued, is to find ways to harness the power of both traditional and new solutions to better serve, inform, and protect, especially in times of crisis, which will often mean pro - viding the right information at the right time. Whether it is during a natural disaster such as the tsunami in Asia or the urgent need to help internally displaced people in Sri Lanka or the evacuation of people in a certain part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo due to a poten - tially catastrophic volcanic eruption: access to timely and reliable information can save lives and allows govern - ments, UN organizations, NGOs, the media and others to achieve a better result. Reality, however, is that many organizations involved in crises, develop point solutions keynote s Peech soon- honG choi, assistant s ecretary-General, c hief t echnology o fficer, u n Deutsche elle lobal M eDia ForuM 2009keynote s Peech 13 12cannot be an island of peace and prosperity and our val - ues and our interests face challenges and threats. These challenges and threats are portrayed constantly on our TV screens, discussed in on-line blogs and chat rooms, captured by the mobile phone cameras of tour - ists or aid workers. We are assailed by images of human rights abuses such as the crack-down on monks demon - strating peacefully in Burma/Myanmar and the children killed or maimed by the fighting in Sri Lanka. We watch footage of the massive flows of migrants pouring across the Afghanistan/Pakistan border from the Swat Val - ley. We see graphic shots of pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden. The list goes on. The EU has developed a common foreign policy to proj - ect its values around the globe and to address these chal - lenges. The size of its population, its GDP and its share of world trade make the EU an active global player with regional and global security interests and with responsi - bilities to match. No individual country in Europe can deal with these challenges on its own. By acting together we achieve much more in tackling the global economic crisis, environmental degradation, climate change, the scourge of international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and regional conflicts such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The EU is at the heart of this security effort. It has moved on from building peace in Europe to building peace around the world. And the global interdependence of today means that others increasingly call on us for our help. This is a role that Europeans and non-Europeans alike want the EU to play. And we need the media as our allies in this to spread our messages, to explain what we do and to help us implement our policies. The EU is responding to the calls for assistance from around the world. It is monitoring a ceasefire in Geor - gia. It is leading international efforts to stabilize and modernize the Balkans and to fight poverty in Africa and develop the African continent. It is training the Afghan, Iraqi and Palestinian police forces as they try to rebuild their societies. It has sent peacekeepers to Bosnia, Chad and Congo, at the UN's request. For us, it goes without saying that foreign policy is not just about what we say. Actions speak louder than words. What we do, and how we do it, is what matters. And here, the role of the media in portraying and explaining what we do is fundamental. The EU's security and defence policy - the opera - tional arm of its common foreign policy - is all about crisis management. We use the full range of resources available to us - from diplomats to development work - ers, from judges to police and - where necessary to keep the peace - soldiers and indeed now sailors in our new - est and first-ever naval operation patrolling the Gulf of Aden and the Somali Basin to protect shipping from pirate attacks. Since 2003, the EU has initiated 23 crisis management operations. Six have been military operations and the rest civilian. Some are police missions, some are border monitoring missions, some are rule-of-law missions, involving a mix of police, judicial and penitentiary ele - ments. If actions speak louder than words, a picture tells a thousand words and images are the best illustration of all. When you see pictures on your TV screens of Ger - man or British police trainers in Kabul, for example, of a French or a Greek warship repelling a pirate attack off the coast of Somalia, of Irish troops helping to protect refugees in Chad, of Swedish border monitors in Geor - gia, of Italian judges in Kosovo - when you see images of people from different EU member states working together in different EU security and defence policy operations abroad - you really see what we are achieving together. Our missions are our chief tool for communicating our policies and we try to ensure that we keep the media fully informed about what they are doing, with press and public information officers in every mission interacting with the press and media in the field, as well as back at base in Brussels. In the age of the day and night news agenda and the instant soundbite, we are constantly in the glare of the media spotlight and we have to be ready to respond with a pithy sound bite at a moment's notice. The media both oblige us to be present and enable us to be present. When news broke last week of North Korea's nuclear test, for example, world leaders all reacted within hours. They had no choice.Conflict prevention in the multimedia age and role of the new technologies, is a subject that goes right to the heart of what the European Union does. I am very grateful to Deutsche Welle for giving me an opportunity to the contribute to the Forum's discussions. We are living in a multimedia era in which the me - dia are constantly diversifying and multiplying. Never has the media landscape changed so quickly or presented us with so many new opportunities - or so many chal - lenges. The world of today has changed radically and it is continuing to change at a dizzying pace. It is a world that is interlinked, precisely because of the explosion of media technologies. In this \"global village\" we are all connected day and night by satellite TV, mobile phones, instant messaging and Internet chat rooms and news flashes around the world in seconds on a constant, 24-hour rolling news agenda. The threats, crises, dangers and disasters that face us are global in nature and they have to be tackled on a global scale. And this is what the European Union does. The European Union was born out of one of the most tragic and devastating conflicts the world has ever seen - the Second World War. After that war, Europeans wanted to find new ways of working together to end the cycle of conflict and division. That was a war in which the new communication technologies of the time had a major impact. The war impinged directly on the lives of people at home more than any previous war had done. This was not only be - cause of the huge level of civilian casualties. It was also because news of the conflict was broadcast on cinema newsreels and on the radios in people's living rooms. So, though they had nothing like today's means of instant communication, ordinary people felt more connected to the fighting going on in other countries, and even on other continents, than they had in previous conflicts.A generation later, we have had soldiers sending pictures to their loved ones from Iraq on their mobile phones. This inevitably has an impact on the public perception of and support for wars being fought in their name and the conditions faced by their troops. After the Second World War, Europeans came together by dismantling trade barriers and developing common polices which laid the foundations of a political project which has transformed Europe. They steadily increased the size of what is now the European Union from six to 12, then to 15, then after the end of the Cold War to 25 and now we are 27 member states. Since the European Union was founded it has enjoyed the longest era of peace and prosperity in its history - notwithstanding the current economic crisis. The EU now comprises 27 sovereign democracies, collectively numbering 500 million citizens. Only a short time ago many of these countries were dictatorships. So Europe developed out of a project for peace and it is founded on its shared values of peace, democracy and human rights, as well as its common interests. It has developed not as a military alliance but on the contrary as an organisation dedicated to peace-making and peace-keeping. We want to promote our values and protect our interests but in the turbulent world of today, Europe conFlict Prevention in the M ultiMeDia aGe - the eu 's role in the W orlD Written contribution by Javier s olana, eu h igh r epresentative for the c ommon Foreign and s ecurity Policy Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009keynote s Peech 15 14 with a careful, considered response. The new media are much more difficult to control and the old distinctions are increasingly dissolving. Questions arise about who has the authoritative version of events, who is responsible for editorial control, who owns the medium, where the limits of the newsroom lie. Doubts may arise about edi - torial quality and integrity. This raises serious questions about press freedom and about the future of journalism as a profession. And this in turn has repercussions for our conflictprevention work. We must and we do integrate media policies into our policy-making and implementation. We support training for journalists and the development of the media in post-conflict regions as an important strand of our develop - ment policy, which goes hand-in-hand with our conflict prevention policy. We must do all we can to support journalism as an economically and socially viable profes - sion and help provide protection for media professionals who often risk their lives reporting on armed conflicts. Our media strategies include seminars and train - ing for journalists in the subject matter with which we deal, namely the conflict resolution and peace building processes of which our European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) missions are a key instrument. Journalism training must also address the issues of ethics and impar - tiality, for example to avoid ethnic and racial discrimina - tion and hatred in broadcasting and publishing. \"Peace journalism\" is a concept that is gaining cur - rency. Should we incorporate \"peace journalism\" into our conflict prevention strategies? Yes, if this means striving to give as much impartial, quality information as possible to the press and media, in all their forms. But we should not forget the contentious debate over the New World Information and Communication Order and the concept of \"development journalism\". This came to be viewed by many as a form of journalism that was supportive and uncritical of Third World governments and could be regarded as code for forms of censorship. We all want to promote peace, reconciliation and conflict resolution and we want the media to help us in this. The best way in which they can do this is to in - form us. This is the journalist's fundamental task. The reporter is there to report. We should be careful not to weigh down the media with additional responsibilities over and above their primary task of providing informa - tion. A healthy media environment is diverse and plural; it is there to explain but not to take sides. The profession of journalism needs no justification and no sophisticated qualification. The fundamental right of press freedom is enshrined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Press and media freedom are a fundamental requisite for a free society. The media - especially the new media - make a vital contribution to conflict pre - vention by enabling dialogue to replace conflict. Free and independent media able to carry the widest range of news, information and opinion are essential for peaceful, stable, democratic societies. And that is what the Euro - pean Union is about: helping to build peaceful, demo - cratic societies. The myriad of new and constantly developing commu - nication technologies are changing the nature of news and the nature of journalism. They are changing the way information is passed and the way we interact with the media. We know how important our daily interaction with media professionals is. We want to help journalists do their work and we try to assist them in every way we can. We are as accessible to all our interlocutors as we can be, without discrimination, and we deal with the local, regional, national and international media. We know that it is important to interact with editors and proprietors as well as reporters. There is no \"one size fits all\" communication policy. We have to tailor the way we work to the circumstances and needs. We have to be ready for robust and rigorous scrutiny but we also have to encourage journalists, in some places, to be more forthcoming with their ques - tions rather than simply recording our statements. We seek to be proactive - rather than merely re - sponding with sound bites - operating further upstream, in order to educate and explain to media professionals what we are doing in our operations, our policies and the way we work. We know how important it is to develop our technical resources. We are constantly developing our website, in order to communicate directly with the public, and up - loading clips of EU diplomacy in action and of the work of our different missions onto YouTube. The new tech - nologies are making us all increasingly active players in the creation and dissemination of news. With the advent of interactive media, on-line publications, blogs, social networking sites, chat-rooms, instant messaging, Twit - ter, we can reach out directly to citizens, to voters. Look how successfully President Obama harnessed the power of the Internet in his election campaign. He understood how to use it to communicate with vital constituencies and to connect and mobilize his supporters. The power of the new media is illustrated by the fact that access to the Internet is blocked or censored in China, for example. And I read recently that the Iranian government had jammed access to Facebook for fear of the power this new medium has to mobilise their op - ponents in the forthcoming presidential election. Cell phones and text messaging are said to have played a role in fostering the Orange Revolution in Ukraine and Twitter is thought to have played a part in rallying dem - onstrators in Moldova recently. A much older technology - radio - has been used extensively and effectively by the UN as a means of communication in peacekeeping. The UN radio station in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Okapi, proved very successful in helping unite the people there after the civil war. But we must not be na\u00efve - the power of the media can of course be unleashed for bad as well as for good. Who can forget the appalling role of Rwanda radio RTLM in triggering the genocide there by urging listeners to pick up machetes and kill \"the cockroaches\"? The constantly evolving nature of the new media is increasingly blurring the distinction between audience and reporter, between politician and publisher, between citizen and editor. Anyone with a mobile phone just about anywhere in the world can be a citizen journalist and get his or her news directly onto an international TV bulletin. The execution of Saddam Hussein was cap - tured by a mobile phone camera and viewed all around the world immediately. Paradoxically, it can still be extremely difficult to get in - formation. Recently, journalists have been barred access to Zimbabwe, to Burma/Myanmar and to Sri Lanka, to mention just a few examples. Reporting of conflicts is essential and journalists must be allowed to work un - impeded. But we must also remember that \"in war, the first casualty is truth\", to quote Aeschylus. This is just as pertinent in today's media age. If anything, it is more difficult now to ensure that the news and information about conflicts is objective. The plethora of information, the wall of pictures assailing us from all sides, do not necessarily tell us the real story. It can be difficult to sift through the mass of information and select the details that are important. There is a danger that the informa - tion we receive is more superficial, with less substance. Many people fear that proprietors' profit motives and the dictates of real-time information, in an age when scoops are a thing of the past, mean more headlines and less analysis. Late news is worse than no news and it is difficult for anyone to come out first with a statement or a reaction to a crisis and very difficult to come out first Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 200916 keynote s Peech 17cal and cultural, because of the media. The devices we know, phone, Internet and personal computer, are merging into a new medium that has its own specific affordances and powers. An extremely rapid evolu - tion has been going on here, Rheingold said, which is likely to continue at an even faster pace in the future. Smart mobs have started to grow all over the world. An online media campaign tipped presidential elections in South Korea on election night. In Spain, people gath - ered despite the ban on public demonstrations after the bombings in Madrid and tipped elections because they distrusted official government declarations blaming ETA for the attacks, whilst in Los Angeles 20,000 high school students joined protests against an immigration bill that could have resulted in their parents being deported, to the effect that the bill failed to pass after mobilizing via MySpace and mobile phones. In Chile, the underfunded education system was protested against by 15 to 16 year old students, which resulted in the resignation of the minister and the beginning of a public dialogue about education. Last but not least, Obama's election campaign successfully sought to overcome the typical hierarchies of election campaigns by engaging the self-organizing grassroots groups using social media such as facebook and twitter. The United States is experimenting current - ly with 'wikis' for public input on policy. Not all dem - onstrations organized this way were peaceful, Professor Rheingold said, but so far peaceful demonstrations have outnumbered by far the destructive ones (such as riots in Nigeria and racist attacks in Australia). Naturally, these new technologies impact the news busi - ness. First evidence of the London tube bombings was a picture taken by a mobile phone and sent to flickr, which was then broadcast on CNN and other channels. George Allen, former senator of Virginia, lost the election he was expected to win, most likely because he made a rac - ist remark that was recorded by a mobile phone and then posted on YouTube. The importance of verification, of contextualization and story-telling is still there. The role of journalists is as important as or more important than ever, but now there are millions of additional report - ers on the scene when things are happening. Thinking more about this intersection of technology and collec - tive action, one can take a look into human history and realize that history, the history of civilization is a his - tory of the co-evolution of the technologies we create, the communication media we sometimes make out of these technologies and the ways we do things together. We are humans, Rheingold emphasized, because we use communication to organize activities together. Com - munication is what ensured the survival of our primate ancestors who were not equipped to defend themselves against predators, but could organize collective defense and food gathering. About 10,000 years ago, hunter- gatherers began to settle in agricultural valleys and built the first cities out of mud and brick. In fact, mud, or clay, became the next big technological medium. Marks on clay that later evolved into writing were originally used to mark transactions, particularly for the next emperors. A powerful way of encoding knowledge over time and space was the emergence of the alphabet about 5,000 years ago, the preserve of an elite chosen by religious and political leaders until the printing press was developed and the literate population grew to a signifi - cant portion. Knowledge gathering and science evolved into a collective enterprise as a consequence and devel - oped extremely rapidly. The existence of the printing press contributed substantively to the impact of Luther's 95 theses. Revolutions of the 18th century were literate revolutions. In what shortly afterwards became the Unit - ed States, the revolt against the British was organized by 'committees of correspondence' who communicated via letters. Debates about the future constitution took place in 'letters to the editors' in major newspapers. Further - more, new forms of economic production arose under the conditions provided for by these new technologies. Commerce and markets are ancient, but capitalism grew from a number of post-Gutenberg inventions, such as the double-entry bookkeeping, corporations, insurance companies, and the banknote. Rheingold turned then to the question of what we should expect next, what the technological platform for the upcoming 10 to 50 years is likely to be. We should imagine billions of people walking around and holding or wearing the equivalent of super computers linked at the equivalent of broadband speed, he said. Social cy - berspaces have been transformed from text-only worlds to multi-media universes within ten years. Micro-pro -\"Cooperation, Conflict, and Participatory Media\" A new story is emerging about how humans get things done together, Professor Rheingold said as he opened his address. There is the old story, which has been learned and reinforced through culture and education and, until recently, also by science. According to the old story, biology is war: only the fiercest survive. Businesses and nations succeed only by defeating, destroying and domi - nating their competition; politics is about your side win - ning, at all costs. The new story is a narrative in which competition is still central but it shrinks slightly to leave room for some new understandings about cooperative arrangements and complex interdependencies, which emerge from various scientific disciplines. Almost ten years ago, some technological or media phe - nomena marked a new beginning. From our perspec - tive today, we can see the striking connection between people walking down the streets of Tokyo looking at their mobile phones; the teenagers in Helsinki sharing information amongst each other via their mobile phones, but not with the adults to whom they were talking; and the mass movement in Manila toppling the corrupt Estrada regime in demonstrations organized mainly via millions of text messages. According to an expert soci - ologist, new technologies have dramatically lowered the threshold for collective action. Rheingold's book Smart Mobs was inspired by these events and his observations as he travelled the world, talking to people and looking more closely into these developments. Technology amplifies people's ability to do all kinds of things; constructive, healthy and beneficial as well as unhealthy and destructive. The word 'mob' was chosen deliberately to reflect this ambiguity, he explained. The book is about the newfound ability to organize all kinds of collective events, not only political but also economi -keynote s Peech hoWarD rhein GolD, author and professor at s tanford and b erkeley, usa Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 200918 keynote s Peech 19Businesses are beginning to understand that the internal and external creation of networks can be much more successful than market competition (Toyota). IBM has open-sourced their software, and today support services for open source software constitutes a major source of its revenues. Even in the pharmaceutical sector now, an open market for solutions has been created (Inno - Centive). Users can put their scientific problems to the community and whoever has a solution can offer it for a negotiable price. The example of open source software shows there are groups of thousands of programmers operating outside of the incentives of the market who have been able to create software that challenged Mi - crosoft's browser and operating systems. E-bay became successful by solving the prisoner's dilemma with a rating system; thousands of volunteers worldwide create a free encyclopedia in almost all languages in the world: Wikipedia. \"ThinkCycle\" is an experimental non-profit initiative that enables people in developing countries to get their problems solved by design students (who, for example, developed a cheap and simple hydration system for people suffering from cholera). Rheingold showed that millions of people who are connected to each other via super computers are able to solve scientific and other problems on an unprecedented scale by simply donating computing power to otherwise intractable questions. People can engage socially through the Asian tsunami blog or the Katrina people-finder wiki, programmed by volunteers. In February 2009, about US $250,000 were donated via twitter for the provision of clean water in 50 villages. To conclude, Rheingold turned to the implications of his findings about collective action for peacebuilding. He said that in all likelihood it is characteristics peculiar to these technologies that enable social activities, lower barriers and multiply the power of action. A precise understanding of these characteristics and of the ways in which technologies might be designed in order to en - able greater cooperation remains to be achieved. A lot of what we know today can be accessed at the 'coopera - tion project' by the Institute For The Future, which also provides a database of basic documents from different disciplines (computer science, sociology, biology) on the topic. Whether an enterprise is microfinance, disaster response, conflict resolution, sustainable development, responsive politics or citizen journalism, understanding the dynamics of cooperation and collective action can multiply its effectiveness. This is not to say that world peace is going to break out if people working on conflict prevention and mediation study the interdisciplinary dy - namics of cooperation. Still, it is possible that knowledge about new frameworks for thinking about problems may stimulate solutions of which we may not otherwise have thought. It is at least possible, he noted with a final hint of irony, that we are today at the stage of knowledge about cooperation, conflict and collective action that we were at in medicine 400 years ago before germ theory, when diseases were believed to be caused by sin, heresy, foreigners or witchcraft.cessors have made possible the once radical wish to use computers as mind-amplifiers. Digital media literacy has spread remarkably: a billion people today are connected to the Internet, there are three billion mobile phones, and 100 million of them are also cameras. These tech - nological changes in the accessibility of production tools and distribution media have led to social, economic and political changes in the ways people communicate. This new set of technologies, practices and skills to which we refer as participatory media, enables broad participation in the production of culture, power, community, and wealth. Participatory media includes but is not limited to; blogs, wikis, RSS feeds, tagging and social book - marking, music, photo and video sharing, mashups, pod - casts, and video blogs. These distinctly different media share three characteristics: 1. Every person connected to the network can broad - cast and receive text, images, data, links, transac - tions, discussions, etc., to and from every other person in the network; 2. they are social media whose value and power de - rives from the active participation of many people; 3. they enable broader, faster and lower cost coordi - nation of collective action. Returning to the sociologist's view of these issues, there is the notion of social dilemmas, the very common colli - sion of individual self-interest and the option of gaining more by doing something collaboratively with others. Sociologists have identified some common myths about social dilemmas. There is, for example, the prisoner's dilemma. How and when will two players who neither trust each other nor communicate, cooperate or fail to cooperate? The matrix developed for this situation was the separate interrogations of two arrested prisoners. Each one is offered a lighter sentence for turning the other one in, which means that if both prisoners turn each other in both get a lighter sentence. If both refuse to do so, both get a larger sentence. However, if only one prisoner betrays the other, s/he will go free while the other one receives a very large sentence. An unse - cured financial transaction is such a prisoner's dilemma. Rheingold shared a recent experiment which yielded very interesting insights into cooperation: the ultimatum game. This situation is about two complete strangers in separate rooms, one of whom is offered a significant amount of money that s/he is obliged to split with the other. However s/he is free to decide on the shares. The second person can either accept the offer, in which case both are paid their agreed amount, or reject the offer, with the end result that neither is paid. As Rheingold explained, modern economic theory is based on the rational, self-interested actor. However, turning down any offer of money is not rational, even though a signifi - cant number of people in the experiment do this. Even more interestingly, the experiment leads to extremely diverse results throughout the world, with some societ - ies not refusing any offer and others not accepting any, some being extremely generous and others not so at all. Therefore, we can conclude that there is no innate sense of fairness but rather that it changes according to our social institutions, he said. Rheingold turned to a second myth that relates to the so-called \"tragedy of the commons\". It says that re - sources, for example land that does not clearly belong to anybody but is used by everybody, are often destroyed. Although it is true that people deforest and destroy fishing populations, empirical evidence gathered by Elinor Ostrom reveals that in fact many groups succeed in maintaining their common goods, given they have a set of designed principles, which other groups do not have. Notably people act to punish cheaters even at a personal cost. This led to the assumption that so-called altruistic punishment may be the glue that holds societies together; brain imaging machines showed that it acti - vates the same areas that are 'responsible' for satisfaction. Some of this knowledge could be applied to real world situations, Rheingold pointed out, such as post-conflict negotiations and peace agreements. However, he con - ceded, we are just about to start learning how to do that and we certainly do not know enough yet in order to know how to design a social situation. But still, he said, it appears the old US saying \"nice guys finish last\" might be wrong, as it could be shown that the presence of people who encourage others to cooperate leads to suc - cess for the group and the popularity of that person. In the meantime, the notion of the self-interested, rational actor seems to become quite unpopular. Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009keynote s Peech 21 20 The applause following Howard Rheingold's presenta - tion was just beginning to fade away when a message alert sounded in the plenary hall, interrupting the scene. Participants who ignored the call for lunch and remained in the room got to watch a fascinating three-minute video about the origins of the Short Message Service (SMS). It's only about 25 years old, but today SMS is a standard used by people all over the world, including for crises and conflict prevention to notify people of emer - gencies and acts of war. The message that Rheingold received and that was displayed on screen was from the creator of SMS, Fred Hillebrand. Hillebrand developed the service in 1985 as part of the Global System for Mo -bile Communication (GSM). The most striking innova - tion was limiting the message length to 160 characters. Within just a few years of its introduction in the early 1990's, SMS became a favorite means of communication around the world. \"SMS is a communication mechanism which can be used for many purposes,\" wrote Hil - lebrand in his message. \"Make sure that it is used much more to prevent conflicts.\" | Felix KottermannviDeo M essa Ge by FreD hillebran D Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009viDeo M essa Ge 23 22 clear that contemporary media spaces cannot be un - derstood in terms of simply comprising professional journalists, but include a variety of actors, for example the armed forces and civil society organizations (i.e. \"The Mutual Responsibility of the Armed Forces and Civil Society\", hosted by the Academy of the German Armed Forces for Information and Communication, and \"Partnership for Peace: Cooperation between Media and Civil Society Institutions\", hosted by the World Catholic Association for Communication and Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflicts). In terms of geographical scope, the Global Media Forum 2009 highlighted the role of new and old media technologies in conflict zones all over the world. Re - gional and country-specific cases ranged from Asia (i.e. \"The Role of the Media in Peacebuilding Processes in Pakistan\", hosted by Deutsche Welle), to Africa (i.e. \"Covering Conflicts in Liberia\", by the Institute of Ap - plied Media Studies (IAM) of Zurich University of Ap - plied Sciences) and the Americas (i.e. \"The Media and Human Rights - The Latin American Panel\", hosted by Deutsche Welle). Acknowledging media impact on crisis situations To understand and appreciate the opportunities and dangers accompanying current changes in the global media architecture, it is first necessary to acknowledge the potential impact of different information and com - munication technologies on political decision-making processes in crisis situations. This was aptly illustrated in two workshops hosted by Deutsche Welle, namely \"Mediators under sustained fire from TV images\" and \"(New) Media and Diaspora Intervention in Conflict Resolution: The Case of Somalia\". It became very ap - parent that the media cannot be understood as simply passively reproducing already manifest facts. Instead, it assumes an active part in shaping political events. Over the past couple of years, a range of media innova - tions have greatly increased the spectrum of opportunities to reach, inform, educate - and influence - audiences. As discussed in the workshop by Eyes and Ears of Europe, journalists may revert to different kinds of \"theatrics\" to get their messages across (\"News and Information Design for Audio-Visual Media - how theatrical can, might or should it be?\"). Brian Storm of MediaStorm gave a presen -tation on how web-based interactive storytelling formats may be used in order to raise public awareness on certain issues (\"'Stories You Don't Forget' - Multimedia Storytell - ing meets Crisis Prevention\"). Media and information technologies as facilitators of crises and tools of war Enhanced technological possibilities and new tech - niques may be employed, however, for rather divergent purposes. Indeed, as illustrated by the workshop of the RIAS Berlin Commission, which compared German and US media coverage of terrorism since 11 September 2001, one and the same event can be covered from very distinct perspectives and to very different effects. For example, journalists might partake in an overall process whereby certain issues become 'securitized' to such an extent that they justify the breaking of democratic norms and values - a danger alluded to by the workshop of the Bonn International Center for Conversion (\"Se - curity and the Media\"). Moreover, Peter Mantello from the Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University in Japan pointed out how new, interactive media formats are being used by the mili - tary for recruitment purposes (\"Pleasure, Ideology and Algorithm: The Rise of the Military Entertainment Complex\"). Similarly, the workshop \"War 2.0\" by the School for Advanced International Studies (SAIS) and the Institut fran\u00e7ais des relations internationales (Ifri) showed how both the US military and terrorist organi - zations were using the Internet in order to disseminate propaganda. In this sense, then, new information and commu - nication technologies become agents of war rather than peace. At the most extreme, they may even be directly integrated into modern weapons systems. The possible dangers related to such developments were highlighted by the workshops \"From Joysticks to Body Count: Ethi - cal Aspects of Modern Warfare\" as well as \"Information Technology: Provoking or Preventing Conflict\", respec - tively organized by the Deutsche Welle and the Forum Computer Professionals for Peace and Social Responsi - bility (FifF). Information technology and crisis prevention On the other end of the spectrum, the conference also Be it twitter, facebook or YouTube - Web 2.0 applica - tions played a crucial role during the Iranian post-elec - tion protests of Summer 2009. On the one hand, de-centralized information exchange via short messaging was one of the primary means by which protesters co - ordinated their movements and activities. On the other hand, given the expulsion of international journalists and the massive censorship of traditional media outlets by the Iranian government, amateur videos and blogs, once disseminated and shared through online platforms, became the by far most important information sources for audiences both abroad and within the country. The video depicting the killing of Iranian student Neda Agha Soltani, taken by an anonymous bystander with a mobile phone, went around the world, vividly illustrating the slogan of the 2009 Global Media Forum: Moving Pic - tures Move Us. The recent experiences in Iran exemplify how new, mostly web-based, communication technologies are exerting profound influence on processes of political change in many parts of the world. At the same time, and with a dramatic increase in the quantity of avail - able information, they are transforming the dynamics of traditional media landscapes. What are the potential benefits of the multimedia age? Where do the possible dangers and pitfalls lie? What kind of implications may we expect for the field of professional journalism? What can journalists do in order to harness opportunities and minimize damage? How can they contribute to the prevention of violent conflict? Somewhat anticipating the important role of new media technologies in the wake of the Iranian protests, these were the main questions put forward at the second Global Media Forum of the Deutsche Welle, which was held from 3 to 5 June 2009 in Bonn. Entitled Conflict Prevention in the Multimedia Age, it brought together media workers, and informant inputs, experts, politi - cians, human rights activists and researchers from many different countries to discuss the role and responsibilities of the media in a rapidly changing world. The general theme and scope of the conference Following up on the theme of last year's Global Media Forum, a large part of the 2009 conference, again, ex - plored the manifold and complex relations between the media and violent conflict. More specifically, however, it emphasized the various impacts of new information and communication technologies on different kinds of crisis situations. For example, the workshops hosted by Inter - Media (\"Media Behavior in Conflict Zones\") as well as the Center for Innovation for Media, Conflict and Peacebuilding at the US Institute of Peace (\"Assessing Media Landscapes in Conflict Situations\") provided for a comprehensive overview of the many functions assumed by a range of media outlets in the particular context of organized and collective violence and/or political re - pression. What kinds of media technologies are being used by which actors to what effect? Here, quite a few workshops identified and reflected upon emerging new patterns of cooperation within and across the media landscapes of conflict-ridden regions. Indeed, in the course of the conference it became very Global Me Dia Foru M 2009: conFlict Prevention in the Multi MeDia aGe Marc von b oeMcken with assistance from Felix k oltermann Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 200924 intro Duction 25suggested a great deal of possibilities for how recent innovations in media and communication technologies could be harnessed for the purpose of preventing cri - ses. In his Keynote Speech, Soon-Hong Choi, Assistant Secretary-General and Chief Information Technology Officer at the United Nations, pointed out that, for example, UN peace operations were increasingly inte - grating various IT devices into their work. Indeed, new information and communication technologies could play a \"key role\" in uniting disparate actors in divided societ - ies. Related to this, the different ways of how they could be used to assist the work of international organiza - tions in preventing or resolving crises were then further explored in the workshop organized by ICT4peace: \"How can Technologies and Information be Leveraged to Manage Crises Better?\" The role and responsibility of professional journalism How should the field of professional journalism respond to the challenges and opportunities presented by (new) media formats and information technologies? Given their potential appropriation for the sake of escalating crisis situations and fighting wars, many participants of the conference observed that the field of professional journalism had a special responsibility with regard to crisis prevention. As Erik Bettermann, DirectormGener - al of the Deutsche Welle, asserted in his opening address, journalists ought to do more than simply \"accompany the damage\" when reporting on conflicts. They should also \"take a stand\", differentiate between \"right\" and \"wrong\" and offer solutions. This decisive point was picked up and elaborated upon in some depth in the workshop \"Conflicts and Responsible Media - Watcher of Disaster and Actors of Change\", which was organized by media21. Journalists as Watchdogs and Agents of Social ChangeGenerally speaking, Guenter Nooke, the Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the German Federal Foreign Office, alluded to the impor - tant normative function of the media as a watchdog of the powerful in democratic societies. What is more, however, journalists themselves can appear\u2014in conjunc -tion with information and communication technolo - gies - as active drivers of social change and progress. By perceiving, for instance, the introduction of broadcasting technologies as furthering \"international understand - ing\", the workshop \"Peaceful Messages and War of Frequencies\", hosted by RWTH Aachen and Maastricht University, placed this observation within a larger his - torical context. Another concrete example from history was provided by the workshop of the Konrad-Adenauer- Foundation (\"Political Conflicts in Europe and the Role of the Media\"), which drew attention to the important contribution of the media to political changes in Europe between 1989 and 1990. As regards present developments, the participants of the conference generally agreed that the possibilities for journalists and the media to actively shape political dynamics constructively had certainly not diminished. Furthermore, not least as a consequence of recent chang - es in the foreign policy of the United States, there may be far more opportunities for crisis prevention in the future than in the past few years - a point made by the workshop of Deutsche Welle on the \"New Directions of US Foreign Policy\". Some workshops looked at the concrete situations in which responsible media coverage might make a decisive difference in terms of preventing crises. In particular, post-electoral disputes were identified as crucial mo - ments in which the media ought to de-escalate possible conflicts between opposing factions of society (i.e. \"Me - dia, Power Politics and Post-Electoral Disputes\", hosted by the Programme in Comparative Media Law and Policy at the University of Oxford, and the workshop \"The Impact of the New Media on Political Transpar - ency in Turbulent Times\", hosted by InWEnt). Other workshops looked at certain media technolo - gies and formats, which are specifically suited for bring - ing about peaceful social change, preventing violent conflict and/or raising public awareness. This included wikis (\"Wikis as Instigators of Social Change\", hosted by the OECD Development Centre), the radio (\"Psyops for Peace? A Presentation on the Methodology, Role and Achievements of the 'Great Lakes Reconciliation' Project\", by Radio la Benevolencija), mobile phones (\"The Mobile Phone as a Conflict Prevention Tool\", by Voices of Africa Media Foundation), Web 2.0 applica -tions (\"Civil Society 2.0 - How Digital Media Change Politics in Turkey\", by the Robert-Bosch-Foundation), twitter (\"Twitter as a Power Tool for Journalists and the Media\", by cellity), mobile TVs (\"Mobile TV Insights and Reflection on Consumer Habits\", by Nokia Siemens Networks and Partner) and computer games (\"From Representation to Simulation: Serious Games and New Approaches to Crisis Media\", by Saarland University). Changing dynamics: the rise of \"citizen journalism\" Most importantly, the conference acknowledged that the increasing ability of the media to directly shape ongo - ing political dynamics was closely linked to the rise of \"citizen journalism\". Observing a shift from \"mass media to media masses\", Erik Bettermann claimed that the \"monopoly\" of traditional media outlets \"is bro - ken\". To an ever greater extent, professional journalists are not the only interpreters and mediators of political events. Instead, and as affirmed in the Deutsche Welle workshop \"Citizen Journalism and Freedom of Speech\", media consumers themselves are exploiting the interac - tive possibilities of the Internet to actively influence public discourse by opening up new channels of com - munication and changing the traditional roles of senders and receivers. An important question here concerned the future role of quality journalism, which - as many participants agreed - needed to filter relevant news from the abundance of available information. New media and social mobilization As demonstrated by the recent protests in Iran, this pro - liferation of amateur-generated media messages can, for example, have significant effects on social and political organization. Howard Rheingold, Professor at the Uni - versities of Stanford and Berkeley, argued in his keynote speech that new communication forms such as instant messaging via Internet and mobile phones have \"dra - matically lowered the threshold for collective action\". He provided many examples of how apparently de- centralized information networks had driven the sponta - neous gathering of people into so-called \"smart mobs\". Although he insisted that the objectives of such groups might be, at least in theory, of an either constructive or destructive nature and there was \"no automatic cor -relation between IT and peace\", he yet made the highly interesting observation that peaceful demonstrations appear to have thus far outnumbered the violent ones. A problem that still needs to be overcome, however, is the so-called \"digital divide\", which refers to the unequal access to new technologies in many parts of the world. New media, censorship and freedom of information The power of new media and communication tech - nologies to raise public awareness, influence political agendas and mobilize large numbers of people is further enhanced by their comparatively high ability to bypass efforts of governmental restrictions and regulation. Questions pertaining to issues of censorship and media freedom were prominently represented at the Global Media Forum. Four workshops discussed them in par - ticular detail (\"Suppressed Websites - Will Censors loose the Race\", hosted by the Committee to Protect Journalists; \"Bypassing Censorship through Blogging? The Blogosphere in Russia\", Con Asian Perspective\", by ABU/AIBD/AMIC; \" 'Cracking Closed Doors' - The Case of Iran, Sudan and Burma\", by PressNow). Whilst acknowledging the potential power of the new media, the conference also cautioned against overestimating their actual effect. In many parts of the world, access to information remains highly restricted. Moreover, as pointed out in the plenary session and in the Deutsche Welle workshop on the \"Young Genera - tion\", the vast majority of Internet-users are young people. Older generations still rely, to a large extent, on traditional media outlets. Dangers of the multimedia age Besides outlining the possible ways in which new media technologies may contribute to crisis prevention, the Global Media Forum also alluded to a range of dangers accompanying the multimedia age. For example, the NASSCOM workshop on \"Security Leaks in Cross- Border Data Flows\" addressed the problem that sensi - tive and confidential information might be stolen (or changed) by 'data pirates' whilst being transmitted from one country to another in ever larger quantities. Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 200926 conFlict Prevention in the MultiMeDia a Ge intro Duction 27\"Digital pollution\" A further concern was that the ongoing fragmentation of the traditional media landscape may decrease the quality of the information being produced. When anyone with a computer and Internet access can become a journal - ist, professional standards might well dissolve. Andreas Krautscheit, Minister for Federal Affairs, Europe and Media of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, warned, for instance, against the rampant lack of respect for intellectual property rights. The so-called 'copy-paste phenomenon' makes it increasingly difficult to verify original sources and thereby abets the spread of possibly distorted and harmful news. Indeed, the ability of new media forms to circumvent regulatory attempts could, in this sense, turn out to be as problematic as it is beneficial - a point emphasized in the Deutsche Welle workshop \"The Empire Strikes Back\". As further explored in the workshop by the European Broadcasting Union (\"More Channels, More News: No More Room for Profound Reporting?\"), the spaces for engaging in investigative, original and truly insightful journalistic work may be disappearing in the wake of unchecked information overload. \"High-speed journalism\" Quality loss could be further exacerbated by a trend to - ward \"high speed journalism\" and \"24-hour-coverage\". The field of professional journalism is, in other words, not only transformed by the emergence of new media technologies but also by increasing market pressures. The need to be among the first to publish news collides with journalistic standards like double-checking of in - formation. What is more, given current financial short - ages, more news has to be produced by fewer people in less time. Here, the Deutsche Welle workshop \"Money and Media - How the Financial Crisis Hits Journalism\" discussed the extent to which the current economic crisis could lead to an impoverishment of professional media outlets. Challenges ahead To counterbalance the detrimental effects of the 'mul - timedia revolution', the conference continually stressed the need to insist upon and promote the core values of professional journalism. Responsibility, participants agreed, is essential - and given the present circumstances perhaps more important than it has ever been. An article published in some part of the world today can cause diplomatic crises in other parts of the world tomorrow. Confronted with the sheer quantity of available informa - tion, media consumers are looking for higher quality and more reliability. Conference participants and speakers agreed that consumers need media channels-, that filter available information in accordance to their needs and interests. To ensure these standards, substantial invest - ments in journalistic training and public broadcasting are indispensible. Quite a number of workshops made concrete and explicit suggestions on how media training may be im - proved, particularly with regard to sensitizing journalists for the difficulties of working in conflict environments. Examples included the two workshops hosted by the Dart Centre on \"Surviving Kidnap\" and the \"Trauma Factor\", which drew attention to the lacking \"trauma awareness\" of many journalists when dealing with vic - tims of violence - a point which was also affirmed by the presentation of medica mondiale. In more general terms, the workshop on \"Constructive Innovation Journalism\" by Stanford University also contained many ideas and suggestions for expanding and improving journalistic training. Above all, however, the conference contended that we need to promote the responsible use of new informa - tion and communication technologies. Importantly, the distinction between 'old' and 'new' media should not be understood here in terms of a fundamental opposition, with one format gradually removing the other. Instead, the major challenge is to reconcile different modes of representation in such a way that they give way to con - structive and innovative media forms, which continue to satisfy professional standards and consumer needs. \"The media changes the world, we change the media\" was the central message of the conference trailer. It is in this sense that the Global Media Forum 2009 could, not least, be seen as a platform to advocate and advertise responsible quality journalism for the multimedia age.

He argued that there is a difference between censorship and regula - tion and that the proposed Arab charter is concerned with the latter. Some form of regulation has become necessary due to minority channels inciting ethnic and religious hatred. These problems are exacerbated by the particular situation of the Middle East. However the charter itself will have no power and there will be little opportunity to enforce it. Philip Rizk responded that 'responsible freedom' is a very flexible term. States in the Middle East have a record of being very controlling of information flow and any move that may result in increased censorship should be opposed. He expressed surprise at Amin's assertion that the charter would have no binding power, ques - tioning as to why, if this were the case, its existence was necessary. Martina Sabra was asked about the differences be - tween local and foreign journalists and whether they were equally free to report. She replied that there is a significant difference between the experiences of the two. Foreign journalists may be better protected than domestic reporters but this will often have the result of restricting access to certain areas of the country or sec - tions of society. Noha Atef spoke about the impact of new forms of media. Pan-Arab satellite stations such as Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya have broken new ground in discussing issues not previously addressed. Developments in technology and the advent of social networking sites and blogs are making effective censorship more difficult to implement. Amin argued that while Internet penetration in Egypt is quite low - just two percent of the population have access - online activities are actually very unregu - lated. He claimed that of the country's 60,000 active bloggers only one was currently in prison, having been found guilty of insulting Islam and the Egyptian presi - dent. Atef questioned the truth of this, saying that last year 100 bloggers were arrested in Egypt and that she knew of many instances of people being harassed or maltreated by police. She explained that because Internet access in Egypt is so limited, the authorities pursue a policy of targeting specific users rather than mass censorship - this way they are able to claim that online freedom was maintained while they were actually suppressing dissent. Rizk explained that while only one individual had Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 200932 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracybeen prosecuted, instances of extrajudicial punishment are common. Freelance journalists are very much at risk of violence but without their work protests against the government would be ignored and forgotten, since state broadcasters do not cover certain things. Sabra was asked whether she felt that the picture was as bleak as other panelists seemed to suggest - is freedom disappearing? She responded that there has never been the level of freedom that the question assumes. Although there has been some kind of a shift in recent years, for most people little has actually changed. Amin argued that the Arab world has a censorial culture and that most forms of censorship are actually self-imposed. Journalists are formed in this culture of self-censorship and it goes on to inform their own work. Despite the fact that matters are changing - previously no one had criticized the president, now people do - this is a slow process. Discussion The panelists were initially asked to comment on the distinctions between censorship and regulation; the desirability of censorship when reporting on issues that could encourage cultural or ethnic division; and the training of journalists to recognize and reduce incidents of self-censorship. Amin outlined four options for regulation: self-regu - lation, judicial regulation, government regulation and no regulation. He argued that the difference between regulation and censorship is huge - censorship aims to destroy the message, regulation to ensure it is articulated in a way satisfactory to all sections of the community. He agreed that there is a need to increase and improve journalistic training and education. Rizk took issue with the idea that censorship could be justified through applying some sort of cultural expla - nation or through insufficient training. It may be that journalistic education in the Middle East does not tackle issues of self-censorship but many people working in the region were actually trained at Western universities. It is mainly a question of restriction by the authorities.Sabra questioned the extent to which journalists were free in Germany and other Western countries. She gave the example of reporters working on stories related to the Israel-Palestine conflict who feel that telling the whole truth could lead to them losing their jobs. Asked to explain what he meant by his use of the term 'responsible freedom' Amin replied that the con - cept is one well defined in academic literature. As examples of irresponsible behavior he cited several occasions in recent years when licenses issued for the establishment of channels to provide cultural program - ming have in fact been used for radical religious broad - casting. He again asserted that talk of extensive suppres - sion of dissent in Egypt is misinformed - there is in fact a multiplicity of media criticizing the government. He did, however, concede that in areas related to religion censorship did exist and expressed his view that this is wholly desirable. In response to being asked whether there will ever be an end to censorship Rizk expressed his belief that in many Arab countries the opposition is being institution - alized. Editors are increasingly being briefed on what they can and cannot say. Centralized regulation will always create a sense of fear and reduce freedom. As evidence of the need for censorship of some form an audience member gave the example of the protests that erupted at the time of the 2002 Miss World com - petition in Nigeria. Riots triggered by a remark in a national newspaper that Mohammed would probably have chosen one of the contestants as a wife resulted in the deaths of more than 200 people. Atef concluded with the comment that we are very skilful at creating reasons for ourselves to justify censor - ship but that ultimately the exercise is futile: where you censor a sentence a book will appear. Acts of censorship are never without consequence. | Sam Croninsecurity an D the M eDia 35 34 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracy security an D the M eDia hoste D by the b onn i nternational c enter F or c onversion ( bicc ) anD the a caDeMy oF the Ger Man a rMeD Forces F or inForMation an D coMMunication ( aik) chair: Joer Gen k lussMann, trainer for conflict transformation, Germany Panelists: anDreas zuMach , taz correspondent in Geneva at the u nited n ations Dieter o se, special a dvisor Joint s upport c ommand c ologne, expert in communication and security policy, Germany Joer G becker , institute for Political s cience, i nnsbruck u niversity and k omtech- institute in s olingen, a ustria/ Germany Since the end of the Cold War and the attacks of 9/11, there has been less emphasis on fundamental values such as democracy and human rights. Such values have been undermined drastically by Western governments. Al - ternatively, increased attention has been drawn toward security by governments, replicated by the media, which has somewhat posed a threat not just to Western democ - racies but countries worldwide. This calls into question the relationship between governments and media outlets. This workshop reflected the role of the media in the securitization of contemporary headline issues. The panel consisting of a wide array of journalists, scholars, and government officials critically reflected on the issue of increased media attention to security. The current rise of the security theme, which was stated to stem from the constructivist approach, contains three vital elements: actor, object, and audience. Peter Croll and Andreas Berns began with an opening statement, which reflected on the rapid securitization of the media and migra - tion fields as well as its possible implications. Joergen Klussmann moderated the panel into a fruitful discus - sion. Joerg Becker initiated the discussion by noting the 60th anniversary of the German constitution. He harshly criticized it for not alluding to words that are imperative for a flourishing democracy. The constitution does not even mention security. Freedom, however, is indirectly referred to through nouns such as human dignity, hu -man rights, peace, and justice. Becker used the example of 9/11. After the attacks, there was a shift from human rights to government regulation, controls, censorship, and national security. This move greatly undermined some fundamental human rights. Instead, increased security became a predominant theme in the first decade of the 21st century. On the one hand, Becker mentioned that the German Parliament passed many privacy laws, which restricted personal information and communica - tion freedoms. The German high courts, on the other hand, drastically restricted such legislation, judging them to be too controlling. Becker was extremely pessimistic about the future role of media and securitization. Media and politics are inevitably intertwined and controlled by the elite on all levels of the political spectrum. In addi - tion, Becker denounced the work of journalists today, arguing that no substantial research is being done; this was mainly due to a lack of funding as well as outside individuals who attempt to influence the media.Dieter Ose took an opposing and pro-government view of securitization and the media. He supported the idea of safeguarding institutions since this would significantly prevent various forms of abuse. In addition, he supported an increase in security since it provides for the wellbeing of citizens and allows them to prosper. Ose supported well-educated and trained forces which can provide good security to a population. He questioned the extent to which governments could limit or censor the media. Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009Many soldiers have their own mobiles and can freely send text messages to their home countries. With this fact, Ose noted, there is no propaganda coming from the military (mainly referring to the German military). In fact, he supported the idea of journalists finding their \"old independence\", suggesting that there should be a reasonable balance between government and the media, Ose noted that journalists had the ability to reach for the far ends of the earth to report. He stated that military security was predominantly transparent today as opposed to the Cold War era. In conclusion, Ose left some ques - tions for the panelists and audience to reflect on. What is the meaning of the term \"security\"? Are there really different agendas with regard to the media and security? Can the media actually play a constructive role? Andreas Zumach, a journalist for the Berlin-based daily die tageszeitung (taz), mentioned that greater securitiza - tion began after the Cold War. Issues of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) became a focal point for the US and the whole of the West. Other is - sues such as climate change have also become greatly securitized. Zumach insisted that the media bears a huge responsibility. He stated, however, that the media had failed in this aspect. There are a couple of concerns Zumach believed that have led to this end. First, jour - nalistic responsibility was not taken seriously by many journalists. Second, Zumach mentioned that new tech - nologies have forced journalists to meet deadlines rather than to concentrate on the quality of research. Third, rampant bribery has occurred through the embedment of journalists in conflict zones. Fourth, journalists are unable to move freely in many cases due to political or military restrictions. He used the example of the US military. US forces not only killed the most journalists in Iraq, they have also not provided adequate protec - tion for them. Zumach stated that the only way to alter this discourse is through change within the media. He also supported the idea of journalists consulting peace research institutes rather than just government sources. The media must reflect on itself and be more \"inward looking\" in order to create effective changes. The panelists all agreed on one common theme: security priorities are now better understood than they used to be, particularly during the Cold War. Audience mem -bers, however, disagreed. Some doubted that there is a broader understanding of security. In addition, several indicated that the identity of the modern journalist remains hazy; they are neither well understood nor re - spected. Therefore, a better understanding of journalists and their role in society is essential. Despite several of the panelists disagreeing with each other, there was some consensus. If things continue down the current course, journalists are doomed to become a dying breed. | Edward Ceska36 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracy Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009security an D the M eDia 37MeDia, PoWer P olitics anD Post-electoral D isPutes hoste D by the Pro GraMMe in c oMParative Me Dia laW an D Policy, u niversity o F oxForD Panelists: nicole s treMlau, u niversity of o xford, uk eMManuel saFFa abDulai, Director, ociety ierra l eone yusuF editor-in- niversity of o xford, uk MelisanDe Mi DDleton, center for i nternational Media ethics, c hicago, usa Post-election violence is a growing issue across the African continent. Increasingly elections are driving violence. Accordingly, the role of the media is a growing issue in the course of elections. To examine the nature of elections or election outcomes in postwar situations, Ni - cole Stremlau provided three broad categories: relatively competitive elections, landslide elections and elections with marked voter apathy. She emphasized the particular importance of analyz - ing this subject against the background of the transition from single party elections to multi-party elections and the ensuing post-electoral conflicts. The democratiza - tion of elections often increases violence, whereby the impact of hate speech is a real concern and difficult to identify. Stremlau noted that multi-party elections in postwar periods are thought to exacerbate politi - cal tensions and can actually hamper peace processes. In this regard, she drew the focus on the institutions and enabling environment in order to understand the intersection between the media and the consolidation of political power. She raised the question about the role and types of media, the progress of the nation and state-building project, the role of international pressure and the culture of relationship between the governed and the government. Here the role of the media should be analyzed diagnostically in terms of its possibilities to prevent violence and to resolve conflicts. Understanding the links between media and politics as well as the role of the media and the reasons why it is that way is central here. Hence Stremlau pointed to the historical pathway of states, the type of politics, the nation/state-building process and the ideologies of liberation movements as critical variables for such analysis. Yet most important in this regard are political, electoral and media factors and the various players involved in the process. The general elections in Ethiopia in 2005 were marked by violence and political disputes. While the election day had been relatively peaceful, the aftermath on the following day unfolded violence, protests and disputes as both parties claimed victory. Daniel Bekele analyzed the ensuing post-electoral crisis based on the role of the private press and both its positive and nega - tive dimensions. On the upside, the importance of the private press becomes obvious as it helped to ensure access to information in particular by creating access to information and views which, according to Bekele, are otherwise not represented or reflected in the state-con - trolled media outlets. The presence of the private press, furthermore, provided a space where public dialogue was kept going and served as the platform to criticize both the ruling party and the opposition. Several jour - nalists took credit of the situation by demonstrating courage and perseverance in spite of a rather hostile en - vironment for journalists. On the downside, some papers were overly sensational and rather acrimonious, which heightened the already polarized political environment. Some even appeared to stoke the ethnic tension, Bekele stressed. Publishers were driven by commercial interest of sensational stories which eventually resulted in inac - curate reporting. He described the highly polarized press as a reflection of the highly polarized political environ - ment characterized by intolerance, stereotyping and no middle ground. There was no proactive and systematic attempt to mediate the political tension, and, as Bekele concluded, responsible African media should not stop conflicts but \"provide means of resolution for social-political conflicts and help avoid violence\". In the course of competitive election, and particu - larly in post-conflict situations in Africa, the practice of hate speech has often been used by politicians to assault their opponents. There is a clear need of freedom of ex - pression, but the line between hate speech and freedom of expression is broad. In the academic discourse there is a complete disagreement about the definition of hate speech. Emmanuel Saffa Abdulai defined the term as \"any form of speech that degrades others and promotes hatred and causes violence against a group of people\". These speeches offend people mostly based on their race, color, religion, or ethnicity. According to Abdulai there must be an intention in the speech or expression to incite predacious treatment or action against any group of people whose classification as such is prompted by common discrimination, spreading, promoting or justifying racial hatred, xenophobia or anti-Semitism or other forms of hatred based on violence. Against the background of the pan-African think - ing Abdulai raised the question of the existence of hate speech. He referred to the view of many Africans, which consider the colonial divide as catalyst for the situation today, characterized by tribal politics such as 'my tribe is my party whether its policies are good or not\". Yet these implications of tribal divide and inter-tribal hatred persists in people's minds. Abdulai argued there is a lack of responsible and professional media. He exemplified this situation by stating: \"Community radio stations are the best thing that has happened to Africa (...) however, these radio stations have also often been used to incite Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009MeDia, P oWer P olitics an D Post-electoral D isPutes 39 38 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracyviolence.\" The misuse of conventional media must be stopped while at the same time reporting impartial from tribal connections is needed, Abdulai concluded. \"At the brink of the failure of Somalia we are trying to build something else in Somaliland,\" Yusuf Gabobe reported about the situation of the elections held in Somaliland down to the present day. The traditional clan system in the country is being used to make peace. However, the second presidential elections in Somali- land will predictably hardly be contested according to Gabobe's assessment. He further argued that 'fore trig - gering' during elections can cause violence as well as the government stopping the opposition from attend - ing meetings and rallies. The presence of international observers has proven to be very important in this regard as they have helped to build trust in electoral processes. He stated: \"People see the international observers and think the world is paying attention to this process and has faith in the elections.\" Furthermore a workshop was held to develop a code of conduct for media to follow in times of elections. Turning to new types of media in the discussion, Gabobe reported the telecommunication rates in So - maliland to be the cheapest in Africa, which carries a big potential for future application. Despite the fact that radio stations in the country are government-owned, Gabobe underlined the importance of oral media in So - maliland due the widespread illiteracy as, contrary to the elections in Kenya where the radio stations used tribal languages which were only understood by a certain group of people, in Somaliland one language prevails. DiscussionThe presentations of the panelist were summarized by Melisande Middleton and lead questions such as \"How do the media shape civil society and public opinion as well as the interaction between the different groups in the society?\" were put up for discussion. The complex evaluation of the use of hate speech during run-up to election and/or post-election situations by the media and politicians was further discussed. Accordingly, the question of how to strike the balance between the rights of the media to report independently and regulated hate speech was addressed as well as the quality of public and private media. One participant asked what the role of the international media is and how it influences a par - ticular situation. The panelists generally highlighted the importance of the international media. However, they critically drew attention to the influential role the inter - national media has or can have e.g. during post-electoral disputes. Hence they called upon the international press to deliver responsible and professional news coverage and to carefully consider the impact their reporting has on countries and societies. | Patrick FallisPolitical conFlicts in euroP e anD the role o F the M eDia hoste D by the journalist, ukraine Gior Gi tarGaMaDze, deputy of the Georgian parliament taMara s krozza, journalist of vre Me, serbia annelie u te Gabanyi, political scientist, journalist, b erlin, Germany holGer Doetsch, university lecturer, b erlin, Germany The chair, Nino Galetti, introduced the workshop's ob - jective to call attention to the role of the media shortly before the fall of the Iron Curtain: \"It happened in the East, but it would have been impossible without the pictures from the West,\" Galetti said. As first panelist, Roman Goncharenko reported on his work at a small radio station in Ukraine ten years ago. Then, Goncharenko and his colleagues had criticized the former government - a dangerous undertaking at that time. The repressive regime spared no efforts to silence the critics, Goncharenko said. Journalists were killed, often after having criticized the president. He concluded by stating that in the early 1990s there was no freedom of press at all in Ukraine. However, things changed with the so-called Orange Revolution in 2004. The \"apathetic society\" finally woke up and people began to use their political power. Goncharenko stressed, that this process ran peacefully not least because of the strong presence of the media. Pictures from the peaceful demonstrations were spread around the world, making it impossible for the Ukrainian leaders to suppress the reporting. Giorgi Targamadze reported on the problems jour - nalists and the media face in Georgia. In his opinion, being in close proximity to Russia is disadvantageous for any country's press freedom. The more the Georgian government tries to fight the Russian influence on the Georgian media, he continued, the more similar to the Russian government it gets. With regard to the current media landscape in Georgia, Targamadze said that the country's three television stations are heavily influenced by the government. Even though newspapers and radios are mostly independent, they are not able to counterbal - ance the influence of the public media, since they play a much smaller role than the TV. Moreover, Targamadze cited a lack of solidarity between Georgian journalists and a low professional standard. He therefore claimed the support of the international community to establish a professional media landscape in Georgia. To give an impression of the work of a journalist in wartime, Tamara Skrozza presented two journalistic stories from Serbia. In May 2000 she worked for a radio station in Belgrade that was independent of the Milos - evic regime. One night, while she was working in the radio station, 40 armed policemen entered their premises and forbade Skrozza and her colleagues to broadcast the news on their channel or to establish any other contact. Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 200940 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracy Political con Flicts in euroe an D the role o F the M eDia 41But they allowed them to play music, Skrozza said, so she and her colleagues played only unusual songs to alert their listeners, thus using the music as a secret code to communicate with the outside world. And indeed, the next day a great number of people had assembled in front of the building looking for the reason for the ex - ceptional broadcast during the night. Skrozza concluded that this story shows that under Milosevic it sometimes was necessary to use secret codes to communicate with the people. The second story that Skrozza reported took place in the winter of 1997 when Belgrade experienced massive demonstrations with thousands of people. The police did not have enough units to control all of the demonstra - tors, Skrozza said, so they used the information from the live reports on the radio about the movement of the demonstrators. When she and her colleagues realized this, they started to broadcast wrong information to confuse the police forces. She stressed that this was not politically correct and it was not objective journalistic work. But at that time it was impossible to be objective and to work correctly if you were against Milosevic, Skrozza concluded. Annelie Gabanyi then raised the question why the Romanian revolution was violent and whether non- violence would have been an option. It is important to know that whereas the Soviets had been very strong in most of the East European countries, in Romania every - thing was controlled by President Ceausescu, decreasing the influence of the Soviets. What seemed to have been an advantage was in fact the reason for the outbreak of violence, Gabanyi pointed out. The only way to change the system was to overthrow the political leaders. Gabanyi continued that the Romanian revolution consisted of several stages. The first began in the 1980s, where the Romanian media became a monopoly of the economic elite and existed side by side with the foreign media. In the second period of the Romanian revolu - tion in 1990, the Romanian media had stopped to play a role, Gabanyi said. Only foreign media from East and West influenced the Romanian people. In the third stage finally, after the flight of Ceausescu, the public media suddenly changed sides and called themselves \"free tele - vision\" with a new program. As former spokesman of the only democratic govern -ment of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in 1989, Holger Doetsch spoke about the role of the media in the GDR. According to Doetsch, the government of the GDR made one remarkable mistake in regard to media and the freedom of press: They prohibited the sale of a Soviet magazine. This confused the people in the GDR who were always told that the Soviets were their friends and the bad influence came only from the West. Doetsch then reportedon an incident at a famous press conference on 9 November 1989, when a jour - nalist asked the spokesman of the government, when the people of the GDR would be allowed to leave the country. The spokesman obviously did not know the answer, but still answered: \"From now on\". This scene, Doetsch remembered, was broadcast on TV, prompting thousands of people to go to the Berlin Wall to finally pull it down. Discussion Goncharenko reported on a discussion he had had with colleagues in the Ukraine during the Orange Revolu - tion. Some journalists were of the opinion that they should support Yushchenko and should therefore report in a predefined way. Goncharenko made clear that he thought this was and that a journalist always has to re - main neutral, even if it might often be difficult. Gabanyi agreed that a journalist should always try to find the truth. During the Romanian revolution they were also confronted with this kind of decision and she decided to stick to the truth, Gabanyi said. A member of the audience then asked what the me - dia can do to support nationbuilding. Skrozza replied that journalists simply need to do their job. They have \"to inform, to educate and to en - tertain,\" she said. Goncharenko disagreed with that. In his opinion journalists should not educate the people but control the authorities. | Manuel Evertz Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 200942 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracy Political con Flicts in euroe an D the role o F the M eDia 43the Mutual resPonsibility oF the ar MeD Forces an D civil society hoste D by the a caDeMy oF the Ger Man a rMeD Forces F or inForMation an D coMMunication ( aik) Panelists: Guenter k nabe, journalist, Germany hans W. oD enthal, colonel (ret.), Germany thoMas schirrM acher, international human rights expert, Germany Guenter Knabe opened the session by presenting a historical overview of the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) prior to and after unification. He high - lighted the fact that it was a great challenge to integrate the two German armies. He also stressed that it was not an easy task for West German society to familiarize itself with the idea that German soldiers would again carry weapons in the aftermath of World War II. After unification, the role of the army changed considerably; as a part of NATO the Bundeswehr is now involved in peacekeeping operations. Furthermore, he pointed to the fact that even when soldiers join the army, they are still a part of society. But how does society deal with the new role of the army? Is there a mutual responsibility or rather mutual irresponsibility? The panelists attempted to provide answers to at least some of these questions. Hans W. Odenthal started by explaining the con - cept and role of a civil society. Amongst many defini - tions, he concentrated on just a few, a civil society as a 'space' of organized activity, as a 'good society' and as an arena for public deliberation. Then he provided a gen - eral overview of such aspects as the Basic German Law, Bundeswehr structural parameters, its missions and func - tions, and finally on a democratic control of the armed forces. While analyzing the German security policy, he based his argument on the case of Kosovo and the ques - tion of whether the Bundeswehr along with the interna - tional community as a whole were allowed to intervene in a country's internal affairs. The responsibility of the state is to protect its citizens and their basic rights. Thus, the international community can only act if the state violates those rights. Another important point was the issue of checks and balances within the army amongst specialized institutions, like the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Defense along with the Parliamentary Com - missioner for the Armed Forces. According to Odenthal, democratic control is crucial because society should stay abreast with developments in the army. Thomas Schirrmacher elaborated on the point that mutual responsibility is only possible when the army has the broad backing of a civil society on one side and if there is continuous discussion on the other. He noted that before World War II, the army was not criticized. In the aftermath, nobody had expected Germany to have an army again and even more than that, society did not want to have armed forces on reflection of World War II. It drove a big debate on the issue of whether Germany should be armed again. The main point was to ensure that what had happened during World War I and II, namely the fact that a single person could make Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009the M utual res Ponsibility o F the ar MeD Forces an D civil society 45 44 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracya decision which led to war, would never happen again. Nowadays, such a decision is made by parliament. More - over, there is a level of democratic control of the army through a Commissioner who writes reports for the parliament on what may be wrong with the army. These reports are published. The media no longer have to try and uncover whether the army is hiding something. Schirrmacher stressed that a soldier is a normal citizen and by entering the army they do not lose their rights. Further to this, obedience is not purely reserved for the armed services, but is also needed in many places outside them. How can one ensure a respect for democratic principles in the forces? Ethics should guide everything that happens in them; the officers are the ones that should follow ethics and the 'inner guidance concept'. Overall, Germany succeeded in creating a military that considerably differs from that of Bismarck and Hitler. The armed forces are now under civilian politi - cal control. The majority of Germans is in favor of the armed forces, but is keen to be included in a discussion whether the Bundeswehr should be involved in mis - sions abroad, such as in Afghanistan. Pressure can build quickly if German society gets the impression that the military is trying to hide something. Obviously certain security measures that need to be kept confidential but there are institutions, such as the Commission for the Forces that are responsible for col - lecting information on misbehavior in military ranks. In the last 20 years, the media has found very little in the way of controversy concerning the armed forces. In gen - eral, the media are keen to find bad news about the mili - tary and publish it as soon as possible, creating a storm amongst the public without permitting a constructive debate. The military faces many ethical problems, with one of the biggest issues being the use of violence. It is a double-edged sword: even though the army does not wish to use violence others may not stick to agreed rules; hence we have to use what we want to fight against. There is a 'control dilemma'; hence the whole society should be involved and the military should speak openly to the public. DiscussionA question was raised on what can be done to prevent violence and the main reasons and causes of violence. A member of the audience remarked that informa - tion presented by the media on the conflict in northern Afghanistan goes through military channels. Journalists want to be protected by the military or private security contractors but NGOs often complain about the pres - ence of the military. They do not want to be seen with the army because they can find themselves in the middle of conflict situations. Another participant remarked that if the military is given too much freedom then the level of order and conduct drops. Odenthal answered that there are a num - ber of national rules and regulations indicating how the military has to treat people while undertaking a mission, and in particular the respect for human rights. Then a question was asked whether we could have an indepen - dent Bundeswehr that would be allowed to intervene where and when it wishes. Both speakers answered that, according to its constitution, Germany does indeed have independent armed forces. They further elaborated on this issue indicating that there are very strict rules on any potential military intervention: basically, parliament makes a decision on military action when a country's territory is under attack whereas abroad it can only act under the NATO mandate together with other states. If Germany were ever to intervene on its own, there always would be somebody saying: \"That's exactly like the old Germany\". Hence, acting together with others prevents situations like that from happening. A discussion also highlighted the importance of the idea of internal guidance during times of warfare. Speakers stressed the fact that there is no handbook with all the answers but officers train themselves to be prepared for various, often unexpected, situations. You may be unable to change a problem or a given situation; however you can ensure that it does not happen again. Currently in Germany a discussion on the issue of the mutual responsibility of society and Bundeswehr is at a starting point; it is a new phase in German history. | Karolina GrzybWikis as insti Gators o F social chanG e? oPPortunities anD risks hoste D by the PMent c entre Panelists: Johannes luettinG , oecD Development c entre, France anDreas n eus, k arlsruhe s ervice r entre, France esPen Pry Dz, oec D Development c entre, France ilona k oGlin, freelance journalist In recent years wikis have become a popular means of creating collaborative websites - the collaborative en - cyclopedia Wikipedia being probably the best-known wiki. The workshop focused on the overall potential for organizations to use wikis. In particular, OECD's new wiki on gender equality, Wikigender.org, was intro - Johannes Luetting identified the three leading ques - tions for the workshop: (1) What is the added-value of wikis, and what are their weaknesses? (2) How can wi - kis contribute to social change and conflict prevention? and (3) Shall public policies support the development of wikis and related tools? In the first presentation, Andreas Neus talked about self- organization tools as catalysts for innovation and change. Starting off with an overview of changing means of information dissemination over time - from the written word to the Internet - Neus showed how technologi - cal progress reduced information costs and resulted in the blurring of a clear distinction between producers and consumers of knowledge. New business models and shifts in power resulted from this development. Web 2.0 offerings can be regarded as examples of such innovative business models. The importance and suc - cess of these offerings in attracting attention are easily recognized when looking at the top 20 English language web sites. Over the last couple of years, sites with user- generated content such as YouTube, Facebook or flickr have increasingly taken over top ranking positions from sites by incumbent operators with a traditional, central - ized value creation. As Web 2.0 tools prove, new ways of information production and distribution are technologically possible. However, it is our mindset that clings to the traditional organization of information, Neus argued. That is why to achieve a shift in people's mindset is the real challenge for the success of a decentralized creation and manage - ment of knowledge. In the case of Wikipedia, the success of a new way of knowledge management is impressive. Launched in 2001, the web site is now available in 25 languages and offers almost three million entries. The success of Wikipedia, Neus explained, is based on transparency, self-organization, simple rules and a legal framework. Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009Wikis as insti Gators o F social chan Ge? o PPortunities an D risks 47 46 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracyChallenges, on the other hand, include managing the complexity of massive collaboration and assuring the quality of the content. Open collaboration in wikis leads to much greater transparency. The ability for everyone to edit entries allows for discourse and consensus-building. However, wikis also hold the potential for conflict. By provid - ing people with the possibility to self-organize, they are breaking the monopoly of hierarchical organizations on coordinating the creation of value, and are thereby chal - lenging their power. With the growing adoption of Web 2.0 tools, orga - nizations will increasingly compete with self-organized individuals in the future. The former will have to face these asymmetric challenges in which their hierarchies are no longer the only and might be far from the best way to organize and coordinate work. As a recommen - dation to them, Neus finished his presentation by quot - ing Mario Andretti with the words: \"If everything seems under control, you are not moving fast enough.\" In the second presentation, Estelle Loiseau and Espen Prydz presented Wikigender as \"a new resource to in - form and reform\". Guided by UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon's words that \"we must do far more to involve women in conflict prevention\", Estelle Loiseau presented Wikigender as an online resource on gender equality us - ing Web 2.0 technology. As a virtual meeting place for gender advocates, it is the aim of OECD to turn Wikigender into a community tool to promote gender equality on all levels, Loiseau said. Non-registered readers can access information on gender equality, registered users can create, edit and discuss articles and data, and external partners are able to manage and maintain the site, and to protect content. The reasons for OECD to specifically launch a wiki on gender issues are manifold. Today, the need for gender equality is recognized around the world and its pursuit is one of the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals, Loiseau emphasized. Moreover, gender equality enhances the long-term growth prospects of countries. Last but not least, gender equality is an important com - ponent of conflict prevention and conflict resolution\u2014a fact which is too often disregarded. The decision to use wiki technology for such a platform is based on a number of reasons. According to Loiseau, Wikigender is the first wiki that provides ex - tensive data and statistics on gender equality. Moreover, presenting statistics on gender equality in a wiki format fosters dialogue and reduces the assumption that this data is exclusively for experts. In particular, Wikigender offers access to high-quality information on gender equality. It is a virtual meeting place where gender advocates can contribute, discuss, and share their knowledge on the issue as well as share best practices and connect with other like-minded people. Furthermore, Wikigender provides access to 124 countries and will soon be available in French, too. Fi - nally, it also enables interested parties to join as partners. As a new feature, which was launched during the Global Media Forum, Espen Prydz introduced \"Social Mapping\". Through collective mapping with Google Maps API, a geographic comparison of issues and data is made possible and knowledge and content can be local - ized. Despite the positive development of Wikigender so far, a wiki hosted by OECD also faces many challenges, Prydz explained. As an international organization, OECD has to pay close attention to ensuring quality control. Furthermore, as wikis heavily rely on external contributors, the success is to a large extent dependent on the ability to get people involved. As for OECD, Wikigender might have paved the way for the introduction of other OECD wikis, such as, for example, Wiki4Progress or Wikichild. In the long term, this will also result in a transformation of organizational culture, Prydz said. To date, Wikigender has been seen both internally and externally as an innovative tool. As Prydz stressed, Wikigender has enabled dialogue with users of OECD's work in a new way, turning them into \"prosumers\", that is consumers and producers of knowledge at the same time. This, in turn, has also improved OECD's knowl - edge and research. With further language versions of Wikigender, new integration tools for sharing, analyzing and visualizing statistics, Wikigender's audience and impact will further increase, Prydz is convinced. If, however, wikis can really instigate social change or even help to prevent conflict is another question. Will wikis make our world a better place? This was the question that Ilona Koglin asked at the beginning of her presentation. In Koglin's opinion, the two wikis Sourcewatch and Green Wikia do so. In the following, she introduced both wikis to the audience, highlighting their potential to instigate social change. The wiki Sourcewatch fights against misinformation by PR industries. Green Wikia, on the other hand, gives advice to people on a green lifestyle. Instead of explain - ing ecological measures such as composting in a scien - tific way, Green Wikia, written from a green point of view, focuses on telling the average reader what they can actually do to behave ecologically. Finally, Koglin addressed the question of how demo - cratic wikis really are. Numbers presented by Koglin showed that 80 percent of Wikipedia users are white, male, between 25 and 35 years old and live in Western countries. Given these numbers, a member of the audi - ence asked how far wikis are in fact a Western approach, given that Africa is off the map. Another member of the audience raised his concern about the objectivity of a wiki from OECD. Certainly, he claimed, such a wiki has to follow OECD policies. Finally, a workshop participant wanted to know why certain wikis work and others do not. The presenters agreed that no clear answer could be given as there is no general recipe that guarantees the success of a wiki. One possibility of getting people involved could be to grant long-time members a different status than new contributors. This could work as an incentive to keep people involved. After all, a wiki can only thrive if users actively contribute to it. | Katrin Dauenhauer Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009Wikis as insti Gators o F social chan Ge? o PPortunities an D risks 49 48 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracyconFlicts anD resPonsible MeDiaWatcher o F Disaster ... anD actor oF chanG e hoste D by M eDia21 Panelists: siMon h orner, h ead of c ommunication, e uropean c ommission h umanitarian a id department ( echo ), brussels, b elgium eDWarD GirarD et, editor and journalist at media21, Geneva, s witzerland Don h inrichsen, s enior Development Manager, i nstitute for War and Peace r eporting, l ondon, uk Daniel Wer Mus, e xecutive Director, Media21, Geneva, s witzerland The moderator of the panel, Daniel Wermus, began by framing the topic as a question of whether journalists should or should not become actors in a conflict. On the one hand, he argued, there is the notion that the media should remain a neutral and impartial observer; while on the other, there are those instances in which journalists are forced to make difficult decisions that may impact the situation. An example of an organization that ac - knowledges this dilemma is media21, of which Wermus is the Executive Director and one of the founders. Their underlying message is that media is an important aspect of the 21st century and, therefore, is an actor, whether or not we believe that this should be so. This responsibility, Wermus argued, should be taken seriously considering the vast array of problems the world faces. media21 is doing this by bringing journalists and media leaders together with global actors to create a dialogue about possible solutions. Wermus closed by acknowledging that funding is central to their mission and, therefore, media21 has a wide range of partners in the private, public, and non-profit sectors. Edward Girardet chose to focus his presentation on Afghanistan, a country that he began covering three months prior to the invasion by the Soviet Union in 1979. He then continued reporting on the situation over the years because the Christian Science Monitor, the newspaper for which he worked, felt that steady cover - age was important. One of the main trends Girardet had witnessed in recent years was the heavy involvement by the international community in various conflict and hu - manitarian situations. He argued that it was the media's role to maintain consistent vigilance over these interven - tions to ensure accountability. In Afghanistan, US $25 billion have been spent on reconstruction since the start of the war, some of which, Girardet felt, has been wasted. Although Afghan journalists have come a long way, the need for media coverage persists in order to achieve accountability for all parties involved, including private companies and humanitarian organizations. Girardet stated that inter - national organizations must also recognize the value and importance of the media. Many times, meetings occur without the presence of journalists who potentially have a great deal more knowledge than many specialists. Next to take the microphone was Don Hinrichsen, the Senior Development Manager at the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR). This organization was founded in the 1990s as a result of the Balkan wars where there was a real need to train local media who ei - ther didn't have an understanding of the conflict or were too partial. Over a decade later, IWPR has trained more than 5,000 local journalists in, as Hinrichsen put it, \"fair, balanced, and reasonable reporting\", and continues to do so in more than twenty countries. An example of their work is a project currently under way in Kazakh - stan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan that aims to facilitate cooperation between journalists and human rights organizations where collaboration between these two groups has been hindered by a lack of trust. One of the success stories that IWPR had was during the Russia/Georgia war when they were amongst the few groups able to get information out despite power failures and other obstacles. During this time they maintained a balanced view, argued Hinrichsen, because they had people reporting from both sides. Other countries where IWPR works include Paki - stan, Somalia, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Those that receive training are mentored for a one- to two-year period during which time their work is constantly critiqued. The type of training IWPR of- fers is meant to meet the needs of the journalists, which may include basic or advanced skills. One of the key issues they face, explained Hinrichsen, is the \"attrition rate\" - people they train often move on to new jobs in, for example, international organizations. Next, the discussion turned to the relationship between humanitarian organizations and journalists as Simon Horner began his part of the presentation. He started by telling the story of how the media's reporting on the displaced Kurds in 1992 resulted in the creation of ECHO. This, he stated, showed that the media has an important role to play in humanitarian work. As a donor organization, ECHO follows similar principles to those of journalists which are \"neutrality, impartiality, and independence\". They do so because they distinguish between humanitarian and development work, the latter being more involved in political processes. The clash that often occurs with journalists is compli - cated because although humanitarian organizations hope to shed light on crises, which results in higher donor Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009conFlicts an D res Ponsible M eDia - W atcher o F Disaster an D actor o F chan Ge 51 50 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracysupport, they must remain neutral as well. This neutral - ity, argued Horner, allows them access to areas in order to relieve immediate suffering until long-term solutions are created. Therefore, their unwillingness to comment on conflict situations may put journalists and themselves at odds with one another. The example that Horner presented was of a journalist asking him whether or not Israel was committing genocide during its invasion of the Gaza strip. Discussion Girardet responded to two questions raised by the audi - ence with a reiteration of what he had stressed earlier on. One was regarding the concern that reporters are known for \"dancing over the dead bodies\" or chasing sensa - tional stories, while the other questioned whether or not it was right for agencies to leave Sri Lanka now that the conflict had ended. Girardet admitted that, as a young journalist, he was interested in covering wars, but he has since realized that the impacts from a conflict can last far beyond the end of official combat. Thus, there is a need for consistent coverage to draw attention to the problems that persist. The answer rang true in Sri Lanka as well - the fact that the conflict had been declared over does not mean that the international community and media should abandon the story. Hinrichsen added to this by emphasizing the importance of training local journalists because many famous report - ers will fly in and out of a country after covering a single story and without gaining a fundamental understanding of the conflict. He would later add that local journalism can also fill the coverage void being left by larger news agencies in the wake of the economic crisis. Horner of-fered some support for reporters by acknowledging that in his experience this hasn't happened with the big news agencies, but has with national networks from other countries. He also responded to a question about the interac - tions between NGOs and journalists stating that the love/hate relationship may be a permanent feature that both parties will have to do their best to deal with. This topic would come up once again at which point Horner disagreed with the audience member who felt that the humanitarian community (interested in delivering aid) and journalists (seeking full coverage) simply had differ -ent agendas. His mandate, he declared, is to disseminate information about humanitarian crises, which makes his work fully compatible with the principle of full coverage. One unique problem that a participant broached was journalists having to moonlight in order to maintain suf-ficient income. Girardet thought that this was a problem because it compromises the objectivity of those reporters when they rely on other actors for income. He argued that greater investment in journalism would be necessary to stop this from occurring. Wermus ended the session by offering some closing remarks and suggested that a platform for further discussion regarding these pressing issues is needed. | Evan Berard the i MPact o F neW M eDia on Political trans Parency in turbulent tiMes hoste D by the i nternational i nstitute F or Journalis M oF inWent-caPacity b uilDinG international, Ger Many chair: astri D kohl, h ead of the i nternational i nstitute for Journalism ( iiJ), Germany Panelists: ProF. harry Du GMore, Mtn chair of Media and Mobile communication at the school of Journalism and Medias studies at rhodes university, s outh a frica MilDreD nG esa, journalist, k enya hali Fax ansah- aDDo, Political editor, Daily Guide, Ghana Astrid Kohl started the session by introducing the Inter - national Institute for Journalism (IIJ), which is part of an organization called \"Capacity Building International Germany\" (Inwent), commissioned by the German Federal Government in order to assist with the imple - mentation of the Millennium Development Goals. The International Institute for Journalism was founded in 1962 in order to give upcoming young journalists the opportunity to enhance their knowledge in the media business. She went on by asserting that the digital, new media nowadays is found everywhere, both in the developed and in the developing world. She pointed out that \"its impact is especially strong when big power is at stake\". She argued that free and fair elections are not only about proper conditions, but also about having adequate information about policy, political candidates and about the election process. She stressed that elections can bring up conflicts, in particular in cases characterized by an unequal access to power and information. She ended her statement by formulating central questions for the fol -lowing debate: Does the increasing influence of digital media help people in turbulent times and if so, how can the new media help? Do the new media give more trans - parency in our society? In his presentation Harry Dugmore started by re - marking that technology is advancing very rapidly. Hereby the social and political changes, which technol - ogy is able to foster differ greatly depending on who is using the technology. \"It can be used for great good and also for great evil,\" he stated. In his opinion, in Africa it is being predominantly used for good purposes. He continued to explain that the number of democracies in Africa has risen from eight in 1990 to 35 in less than 20 years. But at the same time, he questioned the quality of these democracies and mentioned Angola, Nigeria and Kenya as examples of states, which cannot be called democratic even though they held elections. But what can be done to turn partially democratic countries into largely democratic countries? And what role does the new media play? He argued that new media and tech - nologies allow people to participate more. It is true, he the i MPact o F ne W MeDia on P olitical trans Parency in turbulent ti Mes 53 52 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracysaid, that in the developing world only the minority has access to computers at this point in time, but the af- fordable connectivity is growing rapidly. He went on to demonstrate four key ways of how new media is chang - ing politics and elections in Africa: 1. Diversity and density: New media is creating ad - ditional platforms for expressions of political posi - tions, and a fairer debate about these positions that are less moderated or censored. 2. Empowering participation: New media facilitates citizen journalism and massively aids participation in the 'public sphere'. 3. Reuniting elites: New media is linking the Af- rican diaspora to their home democracies more effectively. 4. Election monitoring: New media allows for new kinds of election-day monitoring and even parallel voter tabulation to create alternative assessments of the freeness and fairness of elections and the valid - ity of the results. He pointed out that new digital media are better at this than traditional media, because they are more decentral - ized and dispersed; they provide much broader access; they are relatively inexpensive and they are increasingly ubiquitous, primarily through the rapid uptake of mobile phones. The next presentation was held by Halifax Ansah- Addo who explained how the new media influenced the election in Ghana in December 2008. He started his presentation by giving an overview of the pre-election phase, in which people felt much more integrated in the election process due to new media. Especially the use of mobile phones contributed to popular participation. The election in 2008 had been the first in which candidates used mobile phones to campaign. This made it easier to even reach people in peripheral regions. He went on ex - plaining that during the second phase, the so-called elec - tion phase, new media played an even more important role. He stressed in particular that problems concerning election fraud can be addressed by new media because of the quick spread of the election results by mobile phones or the Internet. He proceeded by asserting that in the past, it had been very easy for campaign workers to manipulate the results when they were still counting and bringing the votes together. Due to new media, this issue has been more observed. Finally, he highlighted the last phase of the election process, the post-election phase. When the results were confirmed and published, people stayed calm and any excesses could be averted. He emphasized that this post-election phase also ended positively, because of the existence of new media. In his opinion, people knew and believed in the election re - sults because the transparency during the whole election process had been much higher than in the past elections. Mildred Ngesa started the last statement of this session by pointing out that she had quite different experiences with new media during the election process in her home country, Kenya. She stressed that even if new media are having good sides, the \"ugly\" ones are overbalanced. She criticized that it is uncertain who is behind the information coming from new media. Nobody can control the credibility and the quality of news and information, which makes the new media a perfect tool for propaganda, for manipulating people and for distributing untruths. This fact consequently leads to misunderstandings and in a further step, to civil com - motions, especially in developing countries, which was proven during the election in Kenya in 2007. She con - tinued that especially in the period of the election, new media opens the door for political competitors to spread false information. In this context, Ngesa voiced her doubts of how people are able to differentiate between the truth and the lies, especially in rural areas. She proceeded by remarking that the journalistic profession is about objectivity, which nowadays is being destroyed by the new media in which everyone can be a reporter even though not everyone has journalistic skills. In her opinion it would be essential to empower the traditional media, particularly in developing countries, where only a minority of the total population has access to digital and new media. Discussion: The panel discussion opened with the challenging ques - tion from the audience of how democracy is defined and whether it is possible and right to judge from a Western point of view which country has a \"real\" democracy and which does not. According to that question, Dugmore pointed out that there are some very important aspects which characterize a democratic country, like free and fair elections, freedom of the press, freedom of opinion, the possibility to found a political party, equal rights for homosexuals, gender or political equality. Another audience member questioned if traditional media always distribute true and objective information, which led to a discussion of journalistic responsibility. Even if a total objectivity can never be reached, journalists learn and are always trying to be as objective as possible whereas in the digital world in which anybody can be a reporter, there is no commitment of being objective. The last is - sue brought up by an audience member was the relation between transparency and new media. Ngesa answered that new media and transparency are not equal, because the information and news transported through digital media are not always true and are mostly not verified. At the end of the session, the panelists agreed, that even if the new media brought a lot of good renewal, we still need traditional media, especially in the developing world. | Claudia Tesfai Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009the i MPact o F ne W MeDia on P olitical trans Parency in turbulent ti Mes 55 54 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracyMeDiators unDer sustaineD Fire FroM television iMaGes hoste D by Deutsche Welle chair: christian F. t riPPe, Director b russels s tudio, Deutsche Welle tv Panelists: christian schWarz-s chillin G, Former h igh r epresentative for b osnia and h erzegovina roy Gut Man, us reporter for n ewsday and Pulitzer Prize winner, n ew y ork, usa FrieD helM brebeck, correspondent for the ar D public broadcasting network during the b alkan War, b ad n euenahr, Germany oliver h ahn, b its iserlohn, Germany Paul k inG, nato Do TV images influence policy-making? This can be regarded as the lead question in the workshop on the interdependence between journalists and policymakers in conflict situations. A short film at the beginning of the panel discussion showed graphic images from Iraq, the Balkans and So - malia. To make sense of US involvement and subsequent withdrawal from the East African country, some com - mentators at the time used the phrase \"The media got us in, the media got us out\". Is this a correct assessment of the situation? Christian F. Trippe asked the panelists. Friedhelm Brebeck had serious doubts about this assumption. Except for Vietnam, he argued, pictures by the media have not initiated political decision-making. Instead, political interest was and remains the prime reason for governments to get involved in a conflict. This opinion was shared by Roy Gutman who regarded the above-mentioned assessment as \"almost completely incorrect\". The conflicts in Bosnia and So - malia happened at about the same time. Considering this concurrence, there was a cynical calculation behind the decision to get involved in Somalia as it meant keeping out of Bosnia, Gutman claimed. The pictures from So -malia, on the other hand, only came out after the politi - cal decision-making was done. Oliver Hahn came to a similar conclusion. He ar - gued that one should not overestimate the effects pic - tures can have on politicians. They can create 'corridors' for policy-making but they are rarely solely responsible for political decision-making. This point of view was slightly qualified by Christian Schwarz-Schilling. He argued that if politicians were in the stage of decision-making, the opinion of the popu - lation could influence this process. If a topic aroused controversial debates, news reporting could indeed affect policy-making. There exists some interdependence between journalists and politicians but it can function both ways, Schwarz-Schilling argued. He himself was influenced by Gutman's writings on Bosnia and tried to influence policymakers to put Bosnia on the politi - cal agenda, he told the audience. Gutman's articles also played an important role when NATO launched a war- crime investigation in Bosnia, Paul King added. A lively debate erupted on the question of what a journalist's job should comprise. With respect to his re - porting on the Omaska massacre, Gutman considered his MeDiators un Der sustaine D Fire F roM television i MaGes 57 56 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracyjob to discover reality, not making judgments or telling readers what to do. His colleague Brebeck took an even more radical stance on this question. It would not be the role of journalists to be teachers for society, he argued. \"If you want to change the world with your reports, you are not a journalist but a missionary,\" he said. Although Schwarz-Schilling generally supported Brebeck's opinion, he also pointed to the limitations of this understanding of a journalist's work. When you encounter human rights violations, he argued, you might have more duties than just being a journalist. \"Sometimes, there are situations when we have to go beyond our normal job,\" he claimed. For the journalist, this would mean to not only report, but to also make commentaries. What is the relationship between image and text? Brebeck argued that pictures do not necessarily foster understanding. People look at pictures of war, but they do not know how many have been killed. Although looking at a picture is easier than reading a text, it provides you with less understanding of the situation portrayed. Gutman argued that nevertheless pictures are often required to 'prove' your story. In the case of his reporting on \"Death Camps of Bosnia\", his words did have an impact. But only after the British network ITN sent in two camera teams, did Omaska become a real - ity. This is to say that ITN 'proved' Gutman's story with televised images which had an enormous effect. Gut - man was convinced, however, that print will not lose its relevance as, being relatively low-cost, print often does the investigative work before camera teams come in and get interested in the story. Hahn emphasized that a picture should not simply be taken for truth. Images are ambiguous. A picture might tell more than a thousand words, as the saying goes, but might also lie more than a thousand words, Hahn said. Pictures can get de-contextualized and misused by dif-ferent conflict parties. Gutman agreed and argued that a photograph has to be accompanied by text to make use of it. In most of the cases, he remarked with a twinkle in his eye, photographers just do not know how to write captions. The accompanying text by the journalist, therefore, will set the picture in the right context. The importance of a responsible handling of pho - tographs and new media technologies was also stressed after the discussion was opened to the floor. Using the example of the Taliban in Afghanistan, King empha - sized the need to also 'fight' on the picture front. While the Taliban are medieval in outlook and are blowing up mobile phone masts to prevent technological progress, they use high-tech means to get their message out. This is why public diplomacy is needed to successfully coun - ter their high-tech media war and to also win the war on the image front. King contradicted a question from the audience that public diplomacy was simply invented as a means of controlling pictures after the events on the Balkans became public. Reverting to the question of the power of media im - ages for politicians, Schwarz-Schilling highlighted the media's role on the regional and communal level on the Balkans. In fact, mediators such as Schwarz-Schilling explicitly asked the media to report on the mediation process. Reports from meetings with the mayor of a city as well as stories on the return of refugees to certain areas, in fact, strengthened the position of the media - tors, Schwarz-Schilling said. In this respect, the role of Deutsche Welle should not be underestimated. By pro - viding neutral radio broadcasts with a close follow-up on the negotiations, they supported the mediators, he said. Another question from the audience addressed the issue of embedded journalism. How are places covered where journalists cannot be? Is embedded journalism a useful means to report from there? King remarked that NATO runs trips to Afghanistan for journalists. However, these journalists are in no way embedded. No censorship applies, he claimed. Instead, these trips would solely focus on the security of the reporters. Finally, a member of the audience addressed the future of conflict reporting and gave two options: either the image war will result in the presentation of ever more dramatic pictures of war or a new way of report - ing on conflict will emerge. Which option will prevail remains to be seen. | Katrin DauenhauerPartnershi P For Peace : cooPeration betWeen MeDia anD civil society institutions hoste D by si Gnis\u2014Worl D catholic a ssociation F or c oMMunication an D Global Partnershi P For the Prevention o F arMeD conFlicts (GPP ac) SESSI on on E chair: alvito D e souza, s ecretary General brussels, b elgium Panelists: vlaD iMir bratic, assistant ollins u niversity, v irginia, usa DaMas Missan Ga, Director of radio k wizera, t anzania Florence M Paayei, e xecutive Director of the n airobi Peace i nitiative; co-founder of GPP ac, kenya Marte helle Ma, Program Manager a wareness at ecc P; GPP ac, on chair: Marte helle a wareness niversiteit b russel, b elgium Jean-Paul Marthoz, professor for international journalism, u de l ouvain, b elgium auGusto Miclat Junior, director and co-founder, i nitiatives for i nternational Dialogue, Philippines alvito D e souza, s ecretary General of si Gnis, belgium Session 1: The challenges and possibilities for co - operation between the media and civil society in conflict prevention and peacebuilding Pursuing the question how civil society uses media channels, Vladimir Bratic commenced his presentation by noting that media is much more likely to promote violent conflict than to fight it. As causes he identified the ongoing use and abuse of media by 'conflict pursuing parties' but also current journalistic standards and news values. Media values and culture are more prone to favor conflict, since the slogan \"If it bleads, it leads\" is still true. Furthermore, there is a demand for simple stories. Peacebuilding, however, entails highly complex process - es, Bratic argued. He continued to explain that against this background, activists involved in conflict prevention Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009Partnershi P For P eace: coo Peration bet Ween M eDia an D civil society institutions 59 58 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracyand peacebuilding widely regarded 'old' media practices as detrimental to their goals. Hence, suggestions were discussed how to change these old practices. Others decided to build up new parallel practices by setting up media like United Nations Radio or the Open Broadcast Network. With the development of new media like the internet, this process gained a new dynamic allowing media campaigns such as Mindanews or Save Darfur. Bratic embraced these ideas because he agreed that it is problematic to change old media practices. His conclu - sion and suggestion was therefore: \"Don't hate the media, become the media.\" Presenting the work of Radio Kwizera, Damas Mis - sanga talked about the opportunities of media to cooper - ate with civil society in conflict prevention as well as the challenges connected to this cooperation. Radio Kwiz - era was established in response to conflicting situations among refugees and with the local community in Tanza - nia in 1995. One cause for protracted hatred, insecurity and stereotyping was the lack of communication and reliable information. Rumors were take for reality in this situation. Collaborating with UN agencies, NGOs, local gov - ernments and other stakeholders, Radio Kwizera started to provide reliable information and became a communi - cation tool for refugees and the local community. Pro - grams cover, for example, refugee rights and obligations, the current situation in the camps or basic information about logistics in the area. The opportunities for conflict prevention proved to be substantial, according to Damas: rumors are curbed, stereotypes corrected and under - standing among communities is promoted. Yet, there are also substantial challenges. Damas mentioned the issue of careful news balancing and lan - guage sensitivity that comes along with working in a volatile post-conflict situation. Journalists have to cope with threats and other insecurities like car-jacking but also destroyed infrastructure. Another challenge for journalists working with civil society is to protect their independence and media freedom. Agencies and govern - ments will try to suppress negative reports about their own conduct by threatening to stop funding or other cooperation. Despite of this, Radio Kwizera will continue to sow seeds of hope, Damas concluded.Florence Mpaayei shared the case of Kenya during the 2007 general elections illustrating that media plays a key role in inciting conflict as well as in building peace and conflict prevention. During election years in Kenya, politically instigated violence had become a trend. In re - action and in order to avert any crisis that would lead to violence in 2007, peace-building organizations brought together media owners and other influential actors of society in a \"Partnerships for Peace Forum\" working in collaboration with the United Nations Development Fund. Acknowledging the importance to work with sections of the media the communal aim was to promote peaceful election campaigns. This led to the launch of a campaign dubbed as Chagua Amani, Zuia Noma on the 21st September 2007, the UN International Day of Peace, and that was officiated by the head of state. The partnership organized a visit to Rwanda with Kenyan journalists who learned from Rwanda's experience with the role of media in the infamous Rwanda genocide and the preceding violent incidences. Issues transposed to Kenya were among others the sensitization of the edi - tors guild for the role of media in conflict prevention, the development of peace messages to be disseminated nationally on radio and television channels, as well as having posters, caps or lessos (Kenyan piece of cloth used by women for a variety of purposes) with peace messages printed on them. In addition, peace charters (statements that commit people to observe certain values during elections) were signed by most sectors in society. Despite these efforts, civil society still faced the challenge of how to deal with the influence of continued broadcasts of negative images and messages and the dilemma that negative news sells better than messages for peace. This became more pronounced when the election results were disputed and violence escalated. In this context, Mpaayei advanced the fact that media is part of a society and that there is therefore an interrelationship between values purported by the media and values reflected by this society. Responsible cover - age of events in the midst of crisis is crucial and media is not exempt from playing this role. She concluded by recommending an integrated approach between all segments and sectors of society in promoting peace and conflict prevention. Media should find creative ways to highlight positive news such as acts by citizens who make contributions to better society. Civil society organizations on the other hand can promote a culture of reporting that enhances life by providing trainings on conflict-sensitive journalism as the Nairobi Peace Initiative-Africa already does. Discussion The ensuing discussion centered on the role of media in conflict prevention. The opinion was expressed that media owners have to maintain a competitive market position and thus have a responsibility to make money. In this context it should be kept in mind that stations active in conflict prevention often receive financial and other aid from civil society organizations or other do - nors. One person argued provocatively that civil society groups wanting to achieve more coverage of peace issues should \"make peace more sexy\". Others voiced a more moderate view while not sharing the opinion that media has a responsibility for peacebuilding. They suggested that media has a respon - sibility to produce quality journalism. Quality journal - ism entailed remaining independent and objective while getting the information to the people. A journalist from the audience mentioned dramatizations as used in the 'tabloid press' as detrimental to quality journalism. She went on that the message of a war for example can be brought across without showing close-ups of bodies without limbs or dead eyes of victims. In response, Bratic held that in the face of huge atrocities, media cannot stick to negative values just because the audience demands it. Equally, it would be unrealistic to pretend that media has or can have a value-neutral position. In his view, media has a respon - sibility to react in a peace conducive way to these situa - tions. Mpaayei agreed on the grounds that media shares the responsibility of the whole society to alleviate suffer - ing and prevent conflict. A participant added that media cannot ignore the powerful tool in their hands. She explained that as a student from Africa in Germany she experiences the consequences of on public perception of a whole continent when the only images from Africa are those of poverty and war. Marte Hellema briefly introduced the work of GP - PAC. She recounted that the initiators of the global civil society-led network acknowledge that not only media Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009Partnershi P For P eace: coo Peration bet Ween M eDia an D civil society institutions 61 6060 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracybut also civil society actors have to change to enable fruitful partnerships for conflict prevention. GPPAC was established in 2003 in response to the call by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan for an inter - national conference of civil society organizations work - ing in the field of conflict prevention in his 2001 report Prevention of Armed Conflict. It carries out projects in the five main areas of awareness raising, interaction and advocacy, network building, knowledge generation and sharing and early warning and early response. Session 2: The influence of new media on tradi - tional media and civil society organizations; how lines blur and cooperation changes Georgios Terzis opened the second session with a presen - tation on the influence of 'new' media on mass media and civil society organizations (CSOs). He argued that CSOs and media proponents have different responsibilities due to their different agendas. While media is based on events, CSOs think in processes and both are accountable to their respective funders, boards and constituencies. Moreover, they have different ethical approaches to their respon - sibilities. Journalists argue that their responsibility is to 'objectively' report the 'facts', civil society groups have a principled approach and want media to report conflicts in ways that promote peace. However, distinctions between different stake-holders become blurred since the internet dismantled the traditional communication structure of mass media from sender over a channel to a receiver. All kinds of non-state political organizations now use the new media tools for information gathering and dissemination, training, fundraising, recruiting, networking or planning and coordinating non-virtual activities. While the con - tent of the internet is affected by traditional mass media, NGOs, governments, trade unions, consumer groups and other pressure groups or even rebels and terrorist organizations are also users and generators of content. Terzis calls this not a mass but a 'mess' media environ - ment. However, he concluded, most stakeholders active in conflict prevention and resolution do tend to a holistic approach and should therefore work together while recog - nizing their differences. Speaking from the perspective of a Western journal -ist, Jean-Paul Marthoz recalled that notwithstanding all justified criticism, many journalists do their job as responsibility as possible. In the new medium environ - ment, however, this has become increasingly difficult. He mentioned three main problems. First, internet poses an economic problem for traditional media. One result of that is Second, conflict reporting was thematically simpler during the Cold War. Not only are contem - porary conflicts more complex but it is also harder for uninvolved audiences to relate emotionally to any of the parties involved. Consequently, it is also harder to reach people. Third, governments and economic actors have much more resources than most media, which leads to a problematic imbalance between communicators and 'controllers'. Marthoz developed some thoughts on defining responsibility of journalists. He contended that peace - building is not the job of journalists. But neither should they endanger peace with their work. They should keep in mind that their reports can have consequences for peacebuilding and conflict prevention. He further argued, that a duty to report on the build-up of violence is reconcilable with the definition of news. Relating to the discussion of the former session, he agreed that there is a duty to campaign against genocides and atrocities. However, to do their duty to seek the truth journalists also need the help of CSOs. He concluded that this is the interface where a useful relationship between journalists and civil society institutions is possible. Augusto Miclat looked at the possibilities and chal - lenges connected to the use of social media tools by civil society organizations. Whereas traditional media formats build on their 'users' as consumers, social media tools are interactive. Their practical use for CSOs lies in the fields of awareness-raising, policy advocacy, network-building and work collaboration. Examples for social media tools are youtube, flickr, facebook, myspace or skype. Miclat continued by presenting the 'Burma cam - paign' and the campaign 'Mindanao Solidarity'. Both interlinked several social media tools with each other and with online software to manage the content. While the Burma campaign had the form of a visual petition, Mindanao Solidarity was connected to a 10-day Peoples' Peace Solidarity Caravan from the north to the south of the Philippines. He explained that Mindanao represent -ed one of the forgotten conflicts. The caravan had two aims. First, to create solidarity with the victims of the conflict within the Philippines by bringing people from Manila to the south. Second, to raise awareness of the conflict. During the caravan, pictures and other content were uploaded to the internet. The greatest and in the context of the workshop most interesting success was that mainstream media started to report due to the use of new media in order to raise awareness. Miclat noted that peace had become sensational after all. His last example was a multilingual blog as part of the awareness raising initiatives of GPPAC in Southeast Asia. Finally, he summarized some challenges such as the difficulty to monitor and evaluate the processes connected to using the new tools and mentioned some more possible uses of them. For example, Twitter could be used for early warning and early response. Discussion Several participants supported Marthoz in his argument on behalf of journalists. Not only would many jour - nalists cover conflicts in order to achieve freedom and justice but also quality remained a topic. One journalist drew attention to the danger that the \"everybody can be a journalist\" motto of new media may enhance rather than avert conflicts. In her opinion, it is important that journalists stick to professional ethical rules. Terzis agreed but was more pessimistic about the fu - ture of traditional journalism. In his experience, budgets are becoming too small to cover conflicts responsibly, especially when a journalist is not in the area. Remark - ing that twice as many people are hired in lobyying than in journalism, he assumed that old media might run out of money and cease to exist. The question remained how dangerous that development is for democracy. Agreeing that there is a crisis, Marthoz, however, said that it pertains to the whole market, not just jour - nalism. In his opinion, modest media can often cover complex situations better than huge mainstream me - dia who fly into a crisis area and leave it right after the 'event'. He suggested that the need for journalists is increasing. Responding to the issue of individuals being ac - tive as 'reporters' through new media tools, he agreed that not 'everybody' can or should be a professional journalist. To have more voices and perspectives does have advantages, too. A lot of journalists are commit - ted and good but controlled by editors and main stream demands. Closing the workshop, Alvito des Souza presented the work of SIGNIS, the World Catholic Association for Communication. SIGNIS is a network of media profes - sionals whose its members work in television, radio, advocacy and media education, covering issues from spirituality to conflict resolution and human trafficking, to name just a few. SIGNIS advocates media that build a culture of peace, promoting human dignity, justice and reconciliation. SIGNIS recently became a member of GPPAC specifically seeking partnerships for peace. | Kristina von Petersdorff Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia 2009Partnershi For P eace: coo Peration bet Ween M eDia an D civil society institutions 63 62 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracyMore channels , More neW M For P roFounD rePortin G? hoste D ebu) chair: ruxan Dra breJa, World s ervice, uk Panelists: kris b osWell, t eam l eader, ( sr) Petra k ohnen, ceo , euranet, belgium arthur lanDWehr, Program Director, s Wr, Germany leM van e uPen, h ead of s trategy and b usiness Development, radio n etherlands Worldwide ( rnW), t he n etherlands Ruxandra Obreja introduced the question of whether with more channels and more news there is both room and a market for profound reporting. The panel, consist - ing of international broadcasters from various parts of the broadcasting business, discussed this issue. He stated that in times when resources are low and budgets are tightening, it is important to find a balance between covering the news and providing sound reporting. Obreja considered the radio's 1,500 partnerships of broadcasters, mobile opportunities, etc. in times of bud - get constraints to be a successful venture nevertheless. He stated that such partnerships can do unique things, such as sharing images and using fewer cameras. While this model may produce similar products, quality and thorough checking of sources is not compromised. Kris Boswell presented the challenges of a small radio station. With 24 hour news and internet reporting, radio has to be equally fast or their competitors will take a story. Turning written briefs into radio broadcast must be done in a short time frame, leaving less time to find stories and a greater need for multi-tasking, coopera -tion and teamwork. While the radio station brings wide coverage, it still leaves room for investigative journalism, which is key for a small broadcaster to bring the in- depth stories it is valued for. Petra Kohnen presented the perspective of a Eu - ropean radio network, bringing together 16 smaller radio stations from 13 EU states, and broadcasting in 10 languages. Funded by the EU Commission with the aim of bridging the communication gap in Europe, broad - casts from one country are also reported by other EU countries, allowing reporting to move from a national to a European point of view. The new channels serve to communicate EU issues to the people through human stories and audience participation. In 2008, for example, with statistics showing a 30 percent food waste rate in Europe, the network started a campaign asking the EU how the people could have a say in the issue. Lem van Eupen stated that the explosion of channels has led to more superficial broadcasting for most listen - ers. RNW, however, as a small broadcaster, has focused on a niche target group. It focuses on themes of par -ticular interest in the Netherlands, such as international justice and human rights. They use the listeners' interests as a basis for in-depth stories. He explained that if they plan on doing a program involving a large multimedia package on a subject, they will ask their listeners what questions they want to know beforehand, and spend time gathering and screening information in areas that bring added value. Arthur Landwehr emphasized the challenge of prop - erly trained journalists no longer being needed, and gave the following example: when Bloomberg announced an illegitimate rumor of Delta Airlines filing for bankruptcy by merely using the 'drag and drop' function causing a huge drop in the airline's stock, the danger of reporting without a review of the journalist's sources became abvi - ous. He ironically recommended that such companies had better use drag and drops from news stories rather than from blogs. With thousands of channels needing to be filled, all with no money, companies are offering broadcasters free, well-researched stories that fit their particular interests. Where media ratings went up Obreja presented media ratings which went up in the following sectors: a) the main speech channel; b) local channels and sports, and c) podcasts. Landwehr stated the belief that journalism is important keeps journalists running today, but the roles are changing. He added that after having evaluated the informations source, it is up to the journalist to make it usable for all kinds of content. For quick, breaking news the mobile phone is the best medium, while podcasts are better for in-depth cover - age. Obreja stressed the need for more 'experiments', such as integrative newsrooms that bring radio, TV and various media together to have a 360 degree service for all channels. Boswell added that it is up to journalists to put the information into the right context by deciding its reliability and how much weight it should have. Podcasts are an important platform, since they provide a detailed analysis of subjects interesting to individuals. Discussion A member from the audience challenged the ability to provide in-depth reporting, since freelance reporters are not given enough time for in-depth analysis. Boswell Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009More channels, M ore ne Ws: no M ore roo M For P roFounD re Portin G? 65 64 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracychallenged this by pointing to the working conditions at a small station with their own correspondents un - der tight budgets and tremendous pressure and asked why freelancers should be given more time. Landwehr agreed that correspondents are a huge investment and not always worth having since they sometimes bring no return on investment. Kohnen took a different ap - proach, claiming that if added value is important to our broadcasting and freelancers can deliver that, we have to pay for it. It seems that whether or not a station receives public funding is a significant factor in answering this question. A debate occurred after an audience member chal - lenged Landwehr's view that blogs are not credible sources. Landwehr replied that although blogs can be sources, it is the journalists' responsibility to check a blog's information value before they use it as a source to which all panelists agreed. Boswell added that blogs can bring public awareness about an issue even before jour - nalists can. During the Swedish Defense Radio Author - ity's (FRA) attempt to log all blog activity, the public didn't even pick up on the issue until a wave of bloggers challenged the idea and almost caused the government to fall apart as a result. He cautioned, however, that journalists have to take staged blogs into account. Another participant challenged the panel for under - estimating potential future consumers who have turned to reading blogs and asked whether the panel really thought that quality journalism has a chance to survive if it is free online. Boswell replied that many coun - tries have talked about paying for TV through a public licensing fee. Landwehr added that while a public licens - ing fee is paid in Germany, a more thorough licensing fee, covering various media forms, is needed to protect journalism. Reaching out to the audience, especially through new media, however, is critical in preserving the industry. As to young people, he added, we can't as - sume they will become interested in the news when they are older. If we don't reach out to them today, they will never come back to us. An audience member commented that multimedia does not only mean more channels, but also that jour - nalists are expected to do more things. He asked wheth - er this is at all possible. Boswell recognized that journal - ists today have to work harder. Not only do they have a 30-minute window for radio broadcasting, he claimed, but they have to do facebook, upload photographs and write clips, too. Van Eupen stated that not all workers are equally skilled in all the elements required in media production. It is important to create a balance of teams with different skills, including multimedia workers and specialists. When asked by a participant what will happen when free media no longer has a content provider it can live off, Landwehr remarked that news always had a value, but the question is how great it is, and finding ways to protect the information provided. Judging by the discus - sion, it seems that profound reporting still holds critical value. Howeber, maintaining credibility and serving the interests of the audience when everyone's purse strings are tight, requires consolidation and multitasking, as well as support from partnerships, governments and the people. | Courtney Foster the MeDia anD huM an riGhts \u2014 latin a Merican P anel hoste D by Deutsche Welle chair: Jan- uWe ronnebur Ger, dpa correspondent l Germany Panelists: Gloria o rteGa, olombia acu\u00f1a, l avaca.org, argentina anGel P\u00e1ez, l a rep\u00fablica, Peru The session was started by Jan-Uwe Ronneburger with a short presentation on human rights in Latin America, particularly with regard to freedom of the press and the role of the media. A film was shown, which described the difficulties journalists in Colombia face in their daily life. It showed how curbs on press freedom in Colombia is caused by different aspects: the war inside the country is getting worse, which goes along with serious intimidations of those who try to report independently. It was said that journalists are getting phone calls from drug bosses, forcing them not to release certain information the journalists have. Several journalists have already been killed or had to go into exile. The result of the ongoing threats is extensive self-censorship among the journalists. Those who still dare to report critically have to live with a permanent fear of being displaced or even killed, it was stated in the film. The government is also part of the problem as there are many cases of governmental influ - ence on the media. Finally the film presented an initia - tive called \"Medios para la Paz\", which provides a place for journalists to exchange with like-minded people and the goal of which is to raise journalistic standards in spite of the dangers. After the film Ronneburger spoke about the \"long history of human rights violations\" in Latin America. He also pointed out that there is a long history of fighting for human rights. Ronneburger introduced the panelists as representatives who fight for freedom of speech and freedom of the press in Latin America. Claudia Acuna gave a short impression of her experi - ences as a journalist in Latin America and the enormous difficulties for journalists in Argentina and reported about first small steps taken towards a democratic fu - ture with freedom of the press. Acuna said that there are some free media in her country, but that they still face many problems. According to her, one of the main problems are the owners of the media companies who are more interested in their business bottom live figures than in publishing the important news. Acuna then presented a short film which dealt with the death of a young demonstrator called Gustavo Bene - detto who was shot during a demonstration in Buenos Aires in 2001. The surveillance video of a bank which showed the policeman shooting at Bendetto was spread by the media and finally led to the conviction of the policeman. Afterwards Acuna presented statistics about the evo - lution in the use of the different types of media, show - ing that the number of television viewers has increased, while 60 percent of the magazines have disappeared over Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009the M eDia an D hu Man ri Ghts - latin a Merican P anel 67 66 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracythe years. However, the internet is increasingly pushing back television, especially within the young generation, Acuna said. Finally she reported about her project called \"Lavaca\", a communication cooperative dedicated to spreading information about civil organizations and the defense of human rights. \"I share the reality of my colleagues,\" Gloria Ortega Perez stated at the beginning of her contribution. She then gave some further information about the film that shown at the start of the session. It was produced in 2006 and reflected previous years. But even if some figures may differ by now and some journalists even returned from exile, the main statement is still valid, Ortega made clear. Journalists in Colombia are still heavily threat - ened, she said, for example if they report about victims of the FARC-rebels. Moreover, the journalists recently have also been directly threatened by the president, who called journalists \"terrorists\". In addition, trade unions for journalists that could develop more political power are prohibited. Ortega concluded that many journalists in Colombia talk about human rights violations and try to reveal the truth, but they often face massive difficul - ties from different directions themselves. Angel Paez described a concrete situation: between 1990 and 2000 Peru was ruled by President Fujimori with a strong support from the military and the intel - ligence service. To strengthen his power Fujimori bribed journalists and media companies and discredited those who did not want to follow, Paez said. Consequently, the media landscape was very corrupt, but not all of the journalists took the money, he stressed. Some journalists started to report about the nuisances in the country and revealed the corrupt methods of the regime. The jour - nalists' work eventually led to the collapse of Fujimori's government in 2000 Fujimori's demission and his escape to Japan. Paez explained that when Fujimori tried to return to Peru he was arrested and indicted for several crimes. According to Paez, the most important informa - tion during the process again came from investigative journalists. He concluded that this is a good example of the capacities of investigative journalism. Discussion In the following discussion Ronneburger asked the pan - elists about their expectations and hopes related to the new media. Paez replied that the platforms of the new media can be helpful to a journalist's work. However, all information from these platforms has to be verified, which sometimes is quite difficult, he added. Ortega agreed that the new media might help to defend human rights and to reveal human rights violations. But accord - ing to her, the use of the new media is not yet wide - spread enough in her country. Those who have access are still the minority. On the other hand, Ortega also raised concerns related to the new media. The internet is good to get in contact with other people, she said, but one should never forget that this kind of connection can never replace personal contact and personal exchange. Furthermore, she complained about the lack of educa - tion in the use of the new media, which she said would be necessary to establish them properly. In connection with the difficulties of journalists, a member of the audience finally reported about a special kind of \"dictionary\". It contains pre-assigned terms which journalists use to hide the true meaning of their articles or broadcasts. The idea behind that is to bring out the message to those who understand, but at the same time avoid the imminent dangers as described before, it was said. | Manuel Evertz Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009the M eDia an D hu Man ri Ghts - latin a Merican P anel 69 68 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracyMeDia behavior in conFlict zones : a G lobal overvieW hosteD by interMeD ia Panelists: allen c ooPer, consultant to i nterMedia uk l td., uk Peter Gol Dstein, Project Director, a udience scapes, usa susan Gi Gli, c hief o perating o fficer, i nterMedia, usa This workshop opened with the panelists offering a few interesting \"war stories\" they had experienced during years of working in conflict zones. These ranged from questionnaires being stolen from vans in Colombia, to research information being fabricated in Vietnam, and a firearm being brought to a focus group. Susan Gigli then began the first part of the presentation by providing in - formation on InterMedia, the organization from which the three panelists came. She explained that InterMedia is a non-profit research firm based in Washington, DC that focused on media patterns in developing and tra - ditional countries. Their numerous clients come from the public, private, and non-profit sectors, underlining the wide range of applications for the information they provide. The organization's history goes back to the 1950's, but it wasn't until the mid-1990's that it became the independent entity it is now. According to Gigli, they are best known for their work in \"difficult to access\" areas. She presented three potential obstacles to access to any country or region: political, such as government travel restrictions; cul - tural, wherein individuals may be unwilling to partake in a focus group or survey; and security, as is the case in many war-torn nations. The aggregate information received from more than 700 surveys that InterMedia has performed is stored in a data archive. Questions such as \"what types,\" \"who,\" and \"how frequently\" are used to cover the entire spectrum of issues regarding media in traditional and developing societies. Despite the location, questions are usually designed to obtain information on demographics, attitudes, and habits of media usage. She stated that their work deals with both qualitative and quantitative data analysis. Gigli then moved on to some of the specific prob - lems that might be encountered during the survey process. This was consistent with an earlier comment she had made that in this line of work a person should \"double or triple Murphy's Law that everything that can go wrong, will go wrong\". These issues can be practi - cal, political, logistical, or methodological in nature. She added that general guidelines for dealing with these situations are to work with local partners, provide suf- ficient training to employees, and mold expectations to the realities on the ground. However, some problems are unavoidable and in order to best cope with them, argued Gigli, a researcher must be creative, flexible, and pragmatic. Gigli also spoke of how important having a clearly defined objective is when beginning a project. The main question her clients ask her is, \"how effective has something been?\" To this, she responds that it really all depends on what one wants to accomplish, because without an objective, the impacts of media campaigns are not easy to measure. Now that the audience was familiar with the work being done by the presenters, Peter Goldstein moved on to the second part of the discussion, which was the announcement of a new project being launched by InterMedia entitled AudienceScapes. This endeavor, he explained, is funded by a grant from the Gates Founda - tion and is aimed at helping those in the development/ media development sector. The idea is to reorganize the information and services that InterMedia has pro - vided over the years and make them \"useable, useful, and available\". The project will consist of three separate parts: an online resource, a new research program, and a data query tool. The research program will be similar to the work carried out for clients in the past, but will be reoriented to the needs of the development community. It will begin as a pilot in Ghana, Kenya, and Zambia with the hopes of expanding it and creating a useful resource for those working in this field. The second aspect, remarked Goldstein, will be a web tool organized on a country-by-country basis that will utilize InterMedia's survey data. Each country's profile will contain a gen - eral overview of the media landscape as well as specific demographic figures that can easily be used as baseline data for the design and implementation of projects. Also, articles will be available that will analyze the data and the current trends occurring in each country. Finally, a data query tool will be available to search for informa - tion being gathered through the new research program. The project is expected to launch by mid-autumn. In the final part of the workshop, Allen Cooper, from the United Kingdom branch of InterMedia, dis - cussed specific examples of media trends in turbulent areas of the world. He stated that the definition of \"conflict zones,\" in their case, is very broad because the conditions in areas experiencing actual war where \"the bullets are flying\" often make it nearly impossible to perform research. Therefore, included in the discussion were analyses of countries before and after conflict, as well as those experiencing long-term political repression because the media phenomena that occur in these cases tend to be similar. Still, Cooper argued, no two places are ever exactly the same. He made two points: one, that almost all of the work that would be presented had been done for the US International Broadcasters, which is funded by the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG); and the second, that InterMedia uses the international Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009MeDia behavior in con Flict zones: a G lobal overvie W 71 70 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracycode of conduct (ICC) as their guidelines. Cooper chose to start by addressing the behavioral changes that occur within groups of displaced peoples. The following are some of the key findings that their work has produced: behaviors in these groups are molded to specific needs and circumstances, in times of crisis attractiveness of local media declines, informal methods of communica - tion become more important, and new media, when available, are used creatively. The first example was that of Kosovo, where InterMedia first became involved in 1999, and where they have since performed other stud - ies. According to Cooper, some 860,000 ethnic Alba - nians had been displaced, some to Albania and some to Macedonia, but returned within a period of months. Within this group, some stayed in households while others remained in camps or special accommodations, and two in three had a high school education or less. In terms of media usage, one in four had a portable radio, many of which were shared because 86 percent claimed to have access to FM, 80 percent to medium wave, and 65 percent to short wave. Furthermore, only 39 percent had access to television and a very small amount, five percent, to telephones, with no one claim - ing internet or computer access. When compared to past media usage, many habits had changed. For example, while many refugees used Serbian state media or Koso - vo Albanian media before leaving, they no longer did, which was most likely due to technical reasons, specu - lated Cooper. \"Word of mouth\" became notably more important, jumping from about 50 prior to the conflict to around 75 percent during the period of displacement, and international TV and radio were used significantly more. Nine years later, interestingly enough, TV was by far the main source of information and, while interna - tional media was still used, it was not doing very well. This illustrates that behaviors have reverted back to their original patterns. The next example presented was Tibet, a location where in-country research cannot be performed. There - fore, studies focus on the roughly 3,000 individuals leaving Tibet through Nepal each month. This poses the question of whether or not this group was representa - tive of the general population. In order to maximize the value of the data, declared Cooper, it is important to be as systematic in your approach as possible. The research showed that international broadcasters were important and that the \"qualitative embellishments\" that were present illustrated the importance of the word of mouth, which was in fact the primary source of information. When asked what they owned, the respondents first and foremost had televisions, followed by radios, then mobile phones, and very few had internet access. An interesting point here was that levels of usage did not necessarily match the levels of ownership, such with radios where not many people used them despite own - ing them. It was with mobile phones that usage seemed to keep pace with ownership rates. This also, asserted Cooper, illustrated that \"new media\" is not always as relevant as many believe it to be. The next two examples that dealt with displaced people were North Korea and Afghanistan. Because of political restrictions we know very little about North Korea, Cooper explained. The study presented was done with 200 refugees and travelers. It showed that rigid control over media usage persists, but that there are means through which information can circulate. For ex - ample, 30 percent of those interviewed claimed they had modified radios to receive foreign channels. \"Friends and family,\" however, was by far the most important form of communication at 88 percent, which shows signs of hope because this was not likely to be the case in the past due to the threat of punishment. Moving on, Cooper stated that Afghans had experienced a great deal of relocation. The survey found many listening to radio (80 percent) and foreign media dominating domestic sources. Radio and television usage, however, was lower in 2008 than in 2007. Possible reasons were the Taliban resurgence, the ban on Indian soap operas, the destruc - tion of phone towers, and increased criminal activity. Cooper then turned to Africa and discussed three examples: Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and Zimbabwe. In Somalia, around 12 mobile phone companies exist making this one of the main sources of communication as two in five respon - dents say they use text messages to get information. The mobile phone comes second only to the radio, which 93 percent of respondents claimed to have, and 88 percent said they had used one in the past seven days. In the DRC, radio was the most widely used medium with TV coming in second. Newspaper readership was low, which could be due to price and literacy issues. Also, \"friends and family\" once again ranked highly, and interviewees tended to trust national broadcasting. Zim - babwe, on the other hand, showed a slightly different trend with national broadcasting being less trusted than foreign media such as the BBC. This reflects the fact that Zimbabwe is a more polarized society. Yet again, \"friends and family\" were important at 85 percent. Chechnya was the final country discussed where internet use had seen a sharp increase due to advances in mobile phone technology. Discussion Audience participation and questions were interspersed throughout the workshop. Some queries focused on the structure of InterMedia and its methodology, such as the number of full-time employees (to which the answer was 35 in the Washington office). In terms of methodol - ogy, Cooper explained that when a country is analyzed, they first begin with the basics in order to gain a general understanding of the media landscape. Then, upon the request of the client, they may go further in depth with certain issues. How community media fits in to the assessments was also amongst the concerns raised. Cooper responded to this by explaining that InterMedia is interested in look - ing at trends on a national level. Community media, however, tends to be on a small scale which makes poll - ing problematic because a national survey will not ad - equately catch local media characteristics. Furthermore, the surveys tend to be tailored to the needs of interna - tional broadcasters, and while it is of interest to them, it may be a secondary interest. Gigli added that defining \"community media\" is also important in order to accu - rately answer the question, but that, in any case, it would be considered more so in qualitative analyses. Goldstein also took the chance to connect the question to Audi - enceScapes, which will be designed for the development community and will, thus, include topics such as this. Another issue that was brought up by the audience regarding indicators and availability of media led Coo - per to address the issue of new media. Throughout the conference, he stated, there had been quite a bit of talk about new forms of media to the point that it was as if old media didn't exist anymore. However, in this line of work, old media is still very much present and some - times mixes with new technology in a very interesting way. In some cases, word of mouth is the most important source of news. This creates a multiplier effect for those forms of media that reach people directly, a fact that is difficult to account for in the survey process. How InterMedia might go about proving that a campaign had certain impacts was another topic that entered the discussion. Gigli felt that funders are often a little unreasonable when they request proof of success. The reason for this is that proving that a project has had a certain impact is nearly impossible, there are simply too many factors influencing a given situation. She explained that statistics can provide evidence pointing to a certain outcome, but that showing causality is often unobtainable. In a related issue, an audience member wondered whether or not the in-country findings will generally match those of refugee groups. Gigli presented an anecdotal story at this point about research done by Radio Free Europe of former Soviet Republic refugees and tourists. After the fall of the Soviet Union, she explained, consequential studies showed that the find - ings were extremely accurate. Still, this was one case and certainly not a universal norm. | Evan BerardMeDia behavior in con Flict zones: a G lobal overvie W 73 72 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracy Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuMsurvivinG kiDnaP hoste D by D art centre chair: Gavin r ees, Director, Dart c entre e urope Panelists: carlos a lberto Giral Do Monsalve, journalist, el colombiano, colombia ruPert r eiD, security exchange, cait McMahon, Mana GinG Director , Dart c entre, a ustralia Gavin Rees started the workshop with painting a picture of situations in various countries where kidnappings are an endemic reality. He stressed that many people think there is nothing they can do to prepare themselves for being kidnapped whereas there are organizations, such as Dart Centre, which discuss issues of kidnapping and possible ways to prepare for it. He also introduced the Dart Centre as a project dedicated to \"informed, inno - vative and ethical news reporting on violence, conflict and tragedy\". Carlos A. G. Monsalve experienced the trauma of kidnapping when he was abducted in Columbia in 1997. He told his personal story of being a 'captive hostage'. He also told stories of other people who, despite not being involved in a conflict, were kidnapped more than once. When in captivity Monsalve was scared as not long before his abduction he had published an interview with Carlos Castano (chief of a paramilitary organization). When he conducted this interview, he had intended to prove maintaining a balance by presenting the views of both sides of the conflict. He identified himself with this article called \"Voices of pain and hope\" in which he also highlighted the fact that the problem of kidnapping and forced disappearances is a 'destiny' of Colombians. He referred to the problem of kidnaps as \"a heavy burden weighing down the Colombian people\". When asked whether he could give any advice on how to protect oneself against kidnapping, he stressed that for him, as a journalist, it is very difficult to give advice, because he himself is far too much involved. For instance in Valle, Colombia, 12 officials were kidnapped by guerrilla forces pretending to be the military. In situ - ations like this mobile phones or laptops are very weak tools of protection against such strong forces. He stated that in such extreme situations, handbooks and manuals authored by organizations such as the International Red Cross or Reporters without Borders are not very help - ful either. The media in Colombia has more possibilities to tell the truth through virtual means than it used to before. The trauma of being a hostage lies very deep in Colombia. It has to be that way, due to a large number of kidnappings (3,000 per year) and massacres. The civil population and journalists have simply been dragged into the conflict. People in Colombia read stories about kidnappings in order to familiarize themselves with the situation. The reality is very much present in the Colombian media but there is little space for information about the victims and their stories. There are short notices of kidnaps but no attempt to understand the political background and the history of the kidnappings. Carlos' experience led him to think that as a journalist he ought to do something, such as joining human rights' organizations, in order to reflect the conflict on a global scale. He concluded by Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009survivin G kiDnaP 75 74 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracysaying that a priority of Colombian journalists is to save the memory of victims and give those memories a voice. The prime role of a journalist is to tell the truth and the story. A special phenomenon of massacres is the fact that they are often kept secret and people do not want to talk about them. Hence, the main aim of journalists is to help to re-establish the stories of victims and their families. Rupert Reid added that as a journalist, Monsalve speaks to many people in one of the most dangerous countries and stressed that it is important to have good psychological and physical training. Even though it cannot serve as a manual in such a complex and expand - ing conflict like the one in Colombia, it is crucial to be mentally and physically strong, although many journal - ists do not get any training fot that whatsoever. Cait McMahon talked about the importance of psychological training. She stressed how crucial it is to maintain a sense of hope and stay mentally alert in critical situations like captivity. You need an emotional discipline and a sense of endurance. She stated that if one can get through the first day then one can get through a second day and so on. Another important method would be 'self-soothing' techniques in order to lower the feel - ing of anxiety. Discussion A member of the audience asked Monsalve a question about his feelings and experience while in captivity. Monsalve said that even though he was held hostage for only 10 days, it was very hard for him to understand why it happened because he tried to provide a balanced coverage of the conflict in Colombia. He felt confused as a journalist, as he wanted to be independent, whereas the guerrillas treated him as an enemy. In the end though he knew he had to go on and be impartial. What gave him the strength was the awareness that his experi - ence was just a small drop in comparison to hundreds of civilians caught for years in the conflict, who would have no voice if it was not for the journalists. Another question asked was whether reporting on hostage-taking puts journalists in captivity and other people at risk. Monsalve answered thata foundation called Freedom for Press has been established in Colom - bia, which has an alarm network for those who feel that they are in danger of being kidnapped. Journalists do want to tell the truth but they also realize that they take a responsibility for what happens to victims and people in the community. This is an ongoing challenge for journalists, they need to be trained for. The discussion also emphasized the difficult situa - tion in Colombia, where there is little respect for various movements because often paramilitaries present them - selves as journalists, etc. People have a lot of mistrust, as they never really know whom they are dealing with. Even though Monsalve does not foresee a solution to the conflict, as a journalist he is motivated to keep going on with what he is doing. | Karolina Grzybthe trau Ma Factor : the Missin G inGreDient in conFlict Journalis M? hoste D by D art centre Panelists: bruce s haPiro, e xecutive Director of the D art c enter, n ew y ork, usa Milora D ivanovic, Deputy e ditor-in- chief, b lic, s erbia elana neWMan, professor of psychology at the u niversity of t ulsa, usa anDrea r \u00fcbenacker, Director a frica Division, Deutsche Welle a kademie, Germany Bruce Shapiro began by briefly outlining the work of the DART Center - a multilingual organization that aims to provide a resource for journalists who cover violence. He explained his view that trauma is currently a missing ingredient in conflict coverage. Trauma literacy amongst journalists is basic and there is a need to work towards a greater understanding of the effect direct experience of war can have. Many journalists exhibit symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder such as disruptions in memory, empathy or concentration. Trauma awareness is impor - tant for democracy as it can do much to inform report - ing on post-conflict situations.Milorad Ivanovic spoke of his experiences of dealing with trauma in Serbia. He highlighted the ways trauma and post traumatic stress can impair the work of a jour - nalist. An example of this was seen in the case of a Cana - dian reporter who, unable to appreciate that she was being lied to, published a story that included false infor - mation. Ivanovic examined the question of what should be published. He showed a brief video which depicted the summary execution of a number of men during the Balkan conflict of the 1990s and told of a seminar he attended where the video was shown to a group of journalists. The audience were also asked to fill in a brief assessment form and it was found that 20 percent showed signs of post traumatic stress and that 20 percent of those exhibited symptoms serious enough to suggest that they required referral to a psychiatric hospital. Elana Newman gave an overview of the clinical definition of trauma and of the symptoms of post trau - matic stress disorder. She described trauma as a serious injury with physical, cognitive, emotional and behav - ioral symptoms that affects an individual's entire way of seeing the world. Exposure to traumatic experience is a worldwide problem and while incidences are more common in places that have a history of violent upheaval there are also cases in Western countries. Only a minor - ity of people subject to traumatic experiences actually go on to develop post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), though many have subsequent problems with depression, substance abuse and other emotional responses such as shame. Incidences of PTSD are higher amongst certain groups, such as those that have experience of some form of torture. Newman then focused specifically on jour - nalists and trauma. She explained that only nine studies have been conducted in this area and that all were retro - spective and focused exclusively on developed countries. The studies showed that most journalists, between 86 Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009the trau Ma Factor: the G inGreDient in con Flict J ournalis M? 77 76 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracyand 100 percent, had experienced trauma at some stage in their career. The likelihood of this developing into PTSD increases with exposure. Of war correspondents 28 percent show signs of PTSD and the group shows very high rates of depression and substance abuse. They receive very little emotional preparation for their work. Newman concluded that two major steps need to be taken in responding to the problem of trauma. First, the issue needs to be destigmatized and openly discussed; second, a series of culturally specific tools need to be devised that can be used to address the problem in dif- ferent contexts. Andrea R\u00fcbenacker described work she has under - taken for Deutsche Welle in partnership with the DART Center in Cambodia. There a small team was assembled to address the problem - Deutsche Welle supplied journalism skills, DART the psychological expertise and a Cambodian journalist the local knowledge. Follow - ing the years of Khmer Rouge control, Cambodia has particular problems, many people having experienced torture at the hands of others still living freely amongst them. Local customs have also often served to limit the reach of journalism. Of particular relevance is the issue local people have with strong outward expressions of emotion such as crying. When this occurs all parties are felt to have lost face and continuing with an interview is very difficult. The team used role plays to prepare journalists for the situations they would encounter. The interviews were very unusual for Cambodia in that when broadcast they featured only the interviewee, the interviewer was off camera. The pieces produced were very successful and have subsequently been shown on all Cambodian television stations. Discussion The discussion began with an audience member ask - ing how therapeutic it is for an interviewee to discuss traumatic experience. Newman replied that it largely depends on the degree to which they feel in control of their contribution. To feel they have lost control of their story can be very painful. She also stressed the importance of accuracy. Ivanovic responded that it was sometimes difficult to ensure that these two principles were upheld. The nature of journalism with its fast turnover and the need to often shorten stories can cause problems. He also highlighted the problem of interview subjects who sometimes develop forms of attachment to those writing their stories and the difficult situation this can put journalists in. Ruebenacker reported of how, in Cambodia, her team distributed name cards that had information about agencies and places individuals could go for help after interviews were concluded. Shapiro explained that those who have experienced trauma have often lost the most basic existential control over their lives. He stressed the importance of maintain - ing a degree of separation, of understanding that it is their grief not ours. Asked about the studies on journal - ists who have a background of traumatic experience, he responded that virtually no research has been conducted in areas of chronic conflict. Ivanovic talkes about staff of his own newspaper in Serbia, three of whom are in hospital receiving treatment for trauma-related psychiat - ric problems. R\u00fcbenacker spoke of the difficulties of publicizing the problems related to PTSD and trauma, explaining that trauma is not considered 'sexy' and is often ignored. Shapiro argued that it was, however, important not to create a form of 'trauma journalism'. In some places and cultures people are very resistant to talking about them - selves. Ultimately, journalists who are sensitive to their surroundings will come to see trauma in others. Ivanovic then raised the question of the extent to which reporters and publishers should be prepared to traumatize the public. How much blood is acceptable to show? Shapiro responded that there are often cultural differences in different countries. In America, newspa - pers are far less likely to publish bloody images than they are in Spain, but this does not mean that in Spain there are more instances of trauma. Ivanovic raised the prob - lem of violence fatigue, citing the example of a worker in Serbia who, as part of a protest, cut off one of his fingers. He pledged to continue cutting off one finger a day until his demands were met. Media interest fell away after the first day, however, with editors telling their reporters not to return to the story until the worker was preparing to cut off his hand. | Sam Cronin Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009the trau Ma Factor: the G inGreDient in con Flict J ournalis M? 79 78 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracythe role o F the M eDia in Peacebuil DinG Processes in Pakistan hoste D by Deutsche Welle chair: GrahaM lucas, head of the s outh a sia Department at Deutsche Welle Panelists: syeD talat h ussain, e xecutive Director of n ews and c urrent a ffairs, a aj television, Pakistan kaMran Ja Mil khaWaJa, country Manager of FM-100 in k arachi, l ahore and i slamabad, Pakistan taJDar aDaM, Managing Director of Pakistan's distant learning tv channels of l ahore-based v irtual u niversity, Pakistan naJib ahMaD , Director of Programs at Power radio FM-99 network, Pakistan saMar Minallah, Pakistani freelance writer, human rights activist and documentary filmmaker Peter s turM, journalist for the German daily Frankfurter a llgemeine zeitung Graham Lucas, the moderator, began the discussion by stressing that Pakistan and its media have been an issue for many years. He emphasized that the media have had a good influence on Pakistan and that free media also contributed to the civil society movement. The impor - tance of Pakistan has grown because of the war in Af-ghanistan, the 'talibanization' of Pakistan and its threat to civil society. What would happen if Pakistan became a failed state? Would Western countries be attacked? And what would happen if Pakistan's nuclear weapons ended up in the wrong hands? These are all questions - showing the importance Pakistan has for international politics, Lucas explained. He then posed his first question to the panel, \"How free are Pakistani media now?\" The only woman in the panel, Samar Minallah, answered that the media in Pakistan highlight what is important and crucial. \"We don't belong to the govern - ment,\" she explained. Being a human rights activist, Minallah complained that women in Pakistan who face violence don't receive any support from the govern - ment. In her eyes, the media is not free, especially in cases of violence against women. \"It's difficult to write and document about it,\" she said. But, she continued that there is no support from the international media and international actors, either. \"I don't think the media will ever be free,\" Minallah concluded. In the eyes of Syed Talat Hussain, both international and Pakistani media have a problem in the way they propagate news\". New spaces are now available,\" Hus - sain explained. New technologies should be used to highlight topics that have been left out. Theinternet, for example, would be a good tool for that. \"Lots of areas need to be covered and we need tough persons to pick it up,\" said Hussain. Najib Ahmad pointed out that there is a lack of professionals who can handle things in a professional way. Ahmad also made clear that during the Musharraf regime, it was possible to talk about the Taliban but since then, local pressure has grown. \"We get calls from Taliban members but we are still free to report,\" he ex - plained. But he criticized that in some areas journalists are not allowed to move freely. Kamran Jamil Khawaja said that there is no censor - ship in Pakistan but that some stations have problems with individuals. Hussain criticized that free moving international journalists are careless and said that if they want to re - port about Taliban areas they should inform the Taliban before they go there. Khawaja also complained about the low quality of international broadcasting about Pakistan. Khawaja's statements induced Lucas to ask about the panelists' perception of the reporting on Pakistan by Western media. Tajdar Adam replied that they are one-sided. He criticized the expression 'Islamic bomb' as there are no such things as 'Christian bomb', either. He complained that foreign media have never been in favor of Pakistan. He proceeded by showing a photograph of a Paki - stani behind bars. The article, he said, had nothing to do with the picture because the picture was taken many years before. He saw the article and the picture as a perfect example of the lack of in-depth reporting about Pakistan. Hussain supported Adam by saying that the news - paper he showed missed the whole point because the photograph of the man behind bars was taken during the Musharaf regime and had nothing to do with the article. Peter Sturm, the only German journalist in the panel, picked up the fact that international reporters face visa difficulties in Pakistan. Sturm gave an example of a reporter who had a visa only for Islamabad and who was sent to prison for one year because he also visited anoth - er city. \"There are restrictions on western media.\" Minallah disagreed with Sturm. She blamed interna - tional politics because in her eyes \"international politics even destroyed the social context\". Discussion: An audience member mentioned that he is from India and then asked whether if Pakistani media are really free if reporters face visa problems. He also cited that 11 in - ternational journalists got killed in Pakistan last year. He Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009the role o F the M eDia in P eacebui DinG Processes in P akistan 81 80 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracytherefore wanted to know whether the job of a journalist working in Pakistan had become more difficult. Hussain reformulated the question. He asked: \"Does freedom create problem? And in regard to the Taliban propaganda machine, what problems are being created?\" Hussain explained a daily problem journalists have to deal with in Pakistan. When they go to Taliban areas, they have to work with local correspondents and after the work has been done, the correspondents are left behind. And editing the report, the journalists have to take in account the wellbeing of the correspondents left behind. Lucas went on by asking about the Taliban stations, the so-called hate radio. \"On what kind of scale is it happening?\" Hussain said that Taliban are actually using it. And Ahmad added that the Taliban use modern American transmitters. That surprised someone in the audience, who wanted to know where they got them from. Another audience member replied that they got the equipment from someone who wants to destabilize the region. \"Sounds like India,\" Lucas said and picked up the \"blame game\" between India and Pakistan. What's go - ing on, what's your opinion? he wanted to know. Hussain had an answer. They are two countries with nuclear weapons tensely locked toegether. He blamed the Western media nationalism that took place after 9/11 and explained that a similar median nationalism is now taking place between Pakistan and India. Sturm mentioned that while the Mumbai attack was taking place, Indian media were very quick in blaming Pakistan. Lucas then asked: \"Where are you going to be in 5 years?\" Minallah sees a bright future for media in Pakistan. \"We have found many professionals and new media ethics. People question professionals on such issues. And there is a bright hope for women in journalism.\" Khawaja said that in the future Pakistani media will no be less free than western edia. Adam expressed his concern that media might lose focus because of the financial crisis. A female participant asked Minallah what she thinks about the way western media report about women in Pakistan.\"It upsets me\", Minallah replied. She tried to get sup - port, to show problems women have faced since the 9/11 attacks, but got none. She wants Pakistani women to speak for themselves and to have the possibility to show their real spirit. A young journalist in the audience remarked that the media in Pakistan had become a sacred cow. He criti - cized that the panel members blamed the West all the time and he wanted to know if they were journalists or Pakistan journalists. Khawaja replied that they were only trying to give the right picture and to narrate the facts. A Pakistani audience member asked: \"Why don't we accept that we need support from international part - ners?\" Hussain replied that they had been trained to divide the world into two. This means that Westerners are good and the rest are barbarians. \"Nobody denies that we need support and training.\" But he rates Pakistani and Indian media higher than international media. | Nadina SchwarzbeckPeace Ful M essa Ges an D War oF FreQuencies - visions an D realities oF broa DcastinG as a M eans o F international unDerstanD inG hoste D by r Wth a achen an D Maastricht u niversity chair: anDreas Fickers, associate professor for comparative media history, Maastricht u niversity, t he n etherlands Panelists: nina Wor Mbs, broadcasting researcher, r oyal i nstitute of t echnology, s tockholm, s weden christian henrich-Franke, economic history teacher, u niversity of s iegen, Germany christo Ph classen, historian, c enter of c ontemporary h istory at Potsdam, Germany Petra k ohnen, ceo for editorial matters, e uranet, b elgium Public broadcasting was the 'new' media technology of the 1920s. Radio frequencies, however, were strug - gling with interferences due to an overuse of long- and medium- wavebands, a common pool resource. Nina Wormbs looked at the relation between new technolo - gies and politics by examining the ensuing first interna - tional negotiations on frequency planning. In 1925, the \"Union Internationale de Radiophonie\" (UIR) was founded in order to end the \"war of frequen - cies\" by negotiating the allocation of wavelengths be - tween the European states. Wormbs emphasized that this international platform for frequency planning was initi - ated by broadcasting companies and was economically motivated. Moreover, negotiations were conducted by engineers. The resulting 'Geneva Plan' of 1926 allocated a number of wavelengths to each country depending on its area and population in relation to the total European area and population numbers. The definition of the total European territory, however, is already a political issue, as Wormbs pointed out. Also, from a technical point of view criteria like topography and language variety in area should have been taken into account but countries like Switzerland and Yugoslavia, only one wavelength in comparison to, for instance, Germany and France with 12 and 9 wavelengths. She concluded the strong na - tions in Europe achieved a greater share in the resource, making the Geneva Plan an example for what she terms \"technopolitics\". Finally, she said that politics and negotiations on technical communication tools remained connected.

He asked if this example suggests a general pattern in the relationship among new media and politi - cal participants. Further, both papers showed that the distribution of broadcasting services does not only have technical and political dimensions but clearly an economic side. He assumed that the exchange of programs through the Iron Curtain was therefore rather an expression of a demand of communist states for cheap content to fill their schedules than a result of a more peaceful policy. It is also not necessarily true in his opinion that media do produce 'peaceful waves' through exchange. Cold War can be characterized as \"a lack of communication and a sequence of wrong perceptions\". Against that back - ground, he identified media as being more often part of the problem than the solution. He concluded by commenting on the lessons to be learned from the historical examples. First of all, the rise of new media technologies forced people to communi - cate and find pragmatic solutions. Thus, the pure exis - tence of international fora due to new media was helpful. Second, he explored the theory that international poli - tics should consequently concentrate more on the micro level instead of following great visions. Finally, he found that media should not be loaded with too high political expectations. Finally, the work of Euranet was presented by Petra Kohnen. Euranet is a radio network linking internation - al, national and regional European radio stations from 13 EU countries. Two of them are Deutsche Welle and France Internationale. Financed by the European Com - mission, Euranet provides information about events in Europe from a transnational perspective. In addition, af-filiated stations deliver program elements in their respec - tive languages which then form part of joint European programming. Programs are broadcasted on the existing frequencies of participating stations and on the Internet. Kohnen explained that the network's Internet pres - ence allows a multi-lingual and interactive approach that is unique. Apart from providing pan-European content in now nine languages, listeners can discuss topics and contribute to the content of the Euranet site. In addi -tion, a 'university circle' was founded in which students of journalism provide the programmakers with feedback and suggestions. In her opinion, Euranet does contribute to international understanding and European integra - tion. Following, the idea of a European frequency was discussed and it was considered that the Internet might be a sufficient pan-European tool. Kohnen disagreed and explained that a Euroopean frequency would help to overcome different standards of development in the European countries. Moreover, she was of the view that Euranet laid the basis to overcome the old language bar - rier with its system of translations. The discussion then turned to the relationship between media technology and politics. It was remarked that technologies are often misused by politicians. On the one hand, technology can be used to disguise politics. On the other hand, politicians like to present themselves protagonists of modernity and thus be \"lifted up\" by a new technology. Interestingly, as somebody added, the story seems to \"end in tears\" when a new technology is as dynamic as the radio was and the internet is now. Regulations can then hardly catch up. An audience member shared his observation of a high amount of fragmentation of the media environment and expressed his doubt that dialogues leading to conflict resolution are possible within this environment. Kohnen was more optimistic in that respect, pointing to the very dynamic dialogue within the forums of Euranet. | Kristina von PetersdorffWhen tensions between East and West rendered the UIR almost unworkable it lost its influence. However, new forums like the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) continued to bring together belligerent parties in peaceful negotiations. Christian Henrich-Franke presented his study of the vi - sions and realities of the Eurovision network during the first two decades of its existence. Founded in 1954 by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to coordinate program exchanges and coproductions between Euro - pean broadcasters, Eurovision is today often criticized as having failed to achieve its objective. Henrich-Franke rejects this criticism, citing results of his research. He clarified that Eurovision was originally not founded in order to further European integration or other idealistic aims as the critics apparently assume. Rather, Eurovi - sion was envisioned as a pragmatic tool to exchange programs in order to lower costs for broadcasting orga - nizations. Notwithstanding this economic intention, the vision of the network serving as an instrument for transmitting 'waves for peace' and not just 'peaceful waves' existed and gained followers in the 1960s. Henrich-Franke conceded, however, that the efforts to realize that vision failed. Differences in language, mentality, humor or interest of audiences, for example, limited the production of pan-European programs to a point that the idea was abandoned. Only the Eurovision Song Contest survives. Another example are program exchanges between east and west which were dominated by a flow from west to east. On the other hand, Eurovision did successfully transmit 'peaceful waves' and fulfilled its task to enable the exchange of programs. That Eurovision images were allowed to cross the Iron Curtain on the peak of the Cold War speaks of this success. Therefore, Henrich-Franke came to the conclusion that Eurovision waves peacefully united Europe but in diversity. Christoph Classen commented on the interesting fact that the politicians in the 1920s evidently underes - timated the significance of radio as a new medium.

In a speech in Munich, Vice President Biden proclaimed that the administration wished to make a \"symbolic break\" from previous foreign and security policies and emphasized the need for cooperation, multi - lateralism, diplomacy, and the strengthening of alliances. Currently, the Obama administration is taking steps to improve diplomatic dialogue with Iran and North Ko - rea; countries which the Bush administration included in its definition ot the \"axis of evil\". The workshop, consisting of journalists from various outlets, examined the refined foreign policy presented by the new administration and its potential implications worldwide. Steven Craig Clemons began the discussion by using the \"Obama bubble\" metaphor. He mentioned that the bubble has changed the gravity of US foreign policy tremendously from that of the previous administration. Only months ago, at the time of Obama's inauguration, the United States experienced fundamental military, economic, and moral constraints which had a highly negative impact on the view of the US abroad. Con - straints were so large at the time of his rise to presidency that Obama adopted a 'Nixonian strategy'; a strategy that undermined unilateralism and promoted multilater - alism on various global fronts which, in the early 1970s included, opening the diplomatic door with China. Obama differs from the past in that he will disprove the worlds' view of America's inabilities and advocate a \"progressive-realist approach\" to foreign policy. Addi - tionally, Clemons noted that this new course in foreign policy is evidenced through Obama's frequent travels to foreign countries and efforts to revitalize relationships. Dima Tarhini, a host from DT-TV Arabia, explained that people in the Middle East expressed a profound sense of optimism when Obama was elected president. On the one hand, she mentioned that Obama's rise gave hope for a more prosperous era to millions of Arabs and Muslims in the region, while on the other she asserted the considerable challenges Obama would have to con - front in providing a new direction in the Middle East. The challenges include: initiating peace processes, estab - lishing state-to-state relationships with autocratic leaders in the region, dealing with political Islam, and paving a way for democracy in the region. The mere fact that Obama is not Bush is not enough. Middle Easterners hope that Obama will translate his rhetoric into action. Concluding her opening statement, she expressed her doubts whether or not Obama has the leverage to im - prove democracy in the Middle East, particularly with the proposed US-Iranian peace process and women's rights. Jan-Friedrich Kallmorgen compared Obama to Clinton due to their similar pro-European postures. Kallmorgen asserted that the success of the transatlantic relationship depends on compromises from both conti - nents since mutual challenges linger. He specified that Afghanistan, Pakistan and climate change are priorities for both the United States and Germany. In his opinion, the recent economic crisis of General Motors/Opel is not a highlight of transatlantic relations. Kallmorgen went on to criticize Europe's minimal involvement in Afghanistan and hopes that this current course will change. Robert Ward explained that foreign policy and the economy are undeniably intertwined and that so much wealth has been destroyed in the US since the beginning of the Bush administration. In total, approximately eight trillion US dollars have disappeared from household and corporate balance sheets. Ward explained that the administration should focus further on developing Sino- US relations; a relationship that is of vital and mutual interest. In addition, Ward mentioned that US-Latin American relations are undeveloped but believed there is tremendous potential in improving political and eco - nomic relations. Following the introduction of the panelists, Lentz introduced several questions to stir the debate. There seemed to be general consensus among the panelists that climate change is an issue that the US would have to tackle. However, Ward noted that while the US can benefit from climate change economically, other more pressing foreign policy issues such as the economic crisis would take precedence. China, Ward went on to men - tion, is concerned about its money in the US economy and the bleak economic forecast. Kallmorgen stated Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 200986 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracy neW Direction o F us F orei Gn Policy : FroM con Frontation to D ialo Gue 87that the US and Europe would have to lead the way on climate change with China in pursuit. Clemons noted the world expects that Obama will waive the 'magic wand', but warned that the new president is only human. In addition, vast parts of the world doubt US abilities given a tumultuous past ten years. Clemons was optimistic, however, with regard to Obama's new foreign policy objectives. He referred to the G20 meeting in London earlier in the year when observers worldwide were expecting British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicholas Sarkozy to dominate the scene; however, German Chan - cellor Angela Merkel played a pivotal role in expressing her country's economic and military positions with the newly elected president. Also, the fact that President Obama appointed an ambassador to China was a major step in redefining US foreign policy with regard to Asia. Foreign policy challenges with Iran and North Korea were also discussed. Tarhini reiterated that Obama does not have a 'silver bullet' but is in a favorable position to tackle some daunting challenges in the Middle East. She cautioned, however, that the nuclear issue would not change with the election of a new Iranian leader. Clem - ons further added that a peace process will be tedious with a defiant Iran. Panelists further agreed that the issue of North Korea's recent belligerent acts posed a serious challenge to the Obama administration. Ward mentioned that the United States is not in a position to deal with North Korea effectively other than consult major powers such as China and Russia. Clemons and Kallmorgen both acknowledged that security guarantees and strategic realignment would have to be negotiated by China and Russia before any diplomatic engagement can take place. Audience questions with regard to the new direc - tion in US foreign policy varied. One audience member asked pessimistically what the new administration would do to bridge the gap between the United States and the Middle East. Clemons responded by mentioning that Obama's new approach to the Middle East, especially in light of his recent speech in Cairo, would implicate that Arab and Muslim lives do matter to Americans. An au - dience member of Chinese nationality indicated that the United States did not take China's economic potential seriously in the past and questioned whether the fragile relationship between the two countries could improve. Clemons responded by insisting that the United States did take China seriously years ago and a strengthening relationship would be mutually beneficial bearing in mind that the economy in China is producer-oriented and the US economy is consumer-oriented. In conclusion, Lentz asked the panelists what their future expectations of Obama were. Ward remarked that Obama would further complement \"soft power\" with his new direction of foreign policy. Kallmorgen indicated that Obama needs more time to tackle the foreign policy challenges he inherited. Clemons said that contrary to the 'yes men' of the Bush administration, the Obama administration welcomed differing views within his cabinet. | Edward Ceska citizen Journalis M anD FreeD oM oF sPeech hoste D by Deutsche Welle chair: Gabriel Gonzalez , Project Manager, Deutsche Welle, Germany Panelists: oliver nyiru Gubara, Program c oordinator, v oice of a frica, msterdam, t he n etherlands israel y orobo Guebo, journalist and blogger, s omalia nancy WatzM an, investigative journalist and researcher nazli Farokahi, blogger, iran The discussion was introduced by Gabriel Gonzalez who quoted Jay Rosen's definition of 'citizen journalism': \"When people, formerly known as the audience, employ the press tools they have in their possession to inform one another, that's citizen journalism.\" Gonzalez added his own further definition of new forms of dialogue and debate that make use of new network technologies. He further outlined the three forms citizen journalism can take: \u00b7The spontaneous actions of ordinary people, as seen especially after major accidents or disasters such as the terrorist attacks on Mumbai. \u00b7Citizen media projects where citizens are provided with communications technologies and skills to document their own lives. \u00b7Digital activism. As an example of a citizen media project Gonzalez discussed Voices Bolivinas, an undertaking that brings together bloggers and other online contributors to encourage the participation of groups that have previ - ously experienced limited access to online discourse. It aims to enable the sharing of unheard stories and, by consequence, the empowerment of marginal communi - ties through a combination of financial, educational and moral support to those using new forms of media. Gonzalez then gave a number of examples of in - stances where citizen journalists have participated in digital activism. These ranged from a Colombian face - book group called 'a million voices against Farc' which was formed to oppose the violent activities of extremists to an online petition of over 100,000 names protesting against the implementation of a new law which could have the effect of curtailing online freedoms. He argued that citizen journalists have a central role to play in the future and that traditional media has only recently begun to realize this, and finished with a quota - tion from Tom Glocer, CEO of Thompson Reuters: \"In short, the Internet has made us all publishers. It is our Gutenberg moment.\" The panel was made up of winners of the 2009 BOBs - Deutsche Welle's annual blogging awards. Members were asked first to provide a brief outline of their online activities. Nancy Watzman (http://www.politicalpartytime. org/) explained that her site published invitations re - ceived by members of the US Congress to social func -88 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracy citizen J ournalis M an D FreeDoM oF sPeech 89tions. These functions are usually staged either by lob - byists or as arenas in which lobbying activities can take place. Previously, information on these events had been kept secret. Walzman's blog acts as a tool that can be used by citizens to check on the activities of their elected representatives. Israel Guebo (http://leblogdeyoro.ivoire-blog.com/) told the audience that in Ivory Coast there is just one state-owned radio and television broadcaster. As a result, opposition political parties have no opportunity to pres - ent their positions. His blog aims partly to fill this gap. He stresses, however, that it is not just about politics; it also enables him to discuss everyday life. Nazli Farokahi (http://www.4equality.info/) spoke of how the origin of the movement that her blog repre - sents was a campaign four years ago against an Iranian law that forbids female presidents. The site provides a forum for people to write about the position of women in Iran and has successfully encouraged a number of Iranian women to become reporters. It also hosts a peti - tion against discrimination and has been filtered twenty times by the government, more than any other site except for those featuring pornography. Oliver Nyirugubara (http://voicesofafrica.africanews. com/) outlined the activities of Voices of Africa. The organization equips citizen journalists with mobile phones that are able to take videos and then upload con - tent to the internet. Nyirugubara explained that, while he believes there is much scope for projects such as his to help in conflict avoidance, Voices of Africa is not really fighting against anything, rather it is giving access to lo - cal people who would not otherwise be heard. Questions were then addressed by the moderator to each panel member. Nyirugubara was called upon to explain further the practicalities of how Voices of Africa is run. He responded by emphasizing the difference between journalists and reporters and explaining that VOA aims to encourage the latter. Its members are given only six months of training and are encouraged to document their own lives and those of their local community. Farokahi was asked how the safety of those reporting for her site was ensured. She answered that it wasn't and frankly couldn't be. Over the past three years 30 people with connections to the site have been arrested and four are still in prison. Guebo was asked the same question but responded that safety is not such an issue in Ivory Coast. Only once have the authorities there paid nega - tive attention to his work; when he published on his blog a video of a policeman assaulting a driver, he received instructions to take the video down and not publish it again. Waltzman was asked as to how she went about setting up her blog. She explained that the issue of her blog is one the Sunlight Foundation, the organization she works for, has been following for a long time and that establishing the blog was relatively straightforward. The site is part of a general attempt to inform people about what Mem - bers of Congress are involved in. It invites anyone with information on functions Congressional Members have attended to submit that information. Guebo was asked for his view on how blogs can prevent conflict. He explained that he aims to promote dialogue and encourage people in Ivory Coast to under - stand how life in what have become two distinct areas of the country is actually very similar. By promoting this understanding he believes blogs could play a signifi - cant role in preventing recurrences of the mass ethnic violence that has occurred in several parts of Africa in recent years. Finally Nyirugubara was asked whether different forms of media were more applicable to different parts of the world. He stated that he felt different forms could be complementary and gave the example of how each video submitted to his site must be accompanied by a 300 to 400 word text explaining its content. Discussion A member of the audience first asked whether bloggers should have training in journalistic ethics. Nyirugubara responded that he did not feel such training was neces - sary for citizen journalists. He explained that he views blogging as merely another means of self-expression and questioned the necessity of separating personal expres - sion and newsgathering. This prompted the response that there surely needs to be some element of editorial control to ensure the credibility of sources. Waltzman replied that her site makes it clear that it cannot guaran - tee the validity of the information it contains, it operates as a tool and as a point from which people can go on and find further information. The panel was asked about the target audience of their blogs - whether they were intended for domestic or international consumption and how accessible the In - ternet is to ordinary people in the countries they work in. Farokahi replied that while her site did receive international support it was within Iran that it hoped to make an impact. Blogging has played a part in breaking a number of taboos in the country, and she argued it is clear from the government's reaction that they are fright - ened of the activities of the 4equality site. To the ques - tion, \"Why would this be if they did not believe it could be an effective force for change?\", Guebo explained that while his blog targets a readership within Ivory Coast there are limitations on the number of people there who can actually view it. The internet has not penetrated suf- ficiently for most ordinary people to access online con - tent. Nyirugubara explained that this situation of limited access currently prevails in many other parts of Africa. Where it is available the internet is largely the preserve of the elites. He affirmed that this is changing, however, and that developments in the near future, such as the lay - ing of several new undersea telecommunications cables, will help fuel rapidly expanding access. | Sam Cronin Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009citizen J ournalis M an D FreeDoM oF sPeech 91 90 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracyrePortinG conFlicts \u2014 an asian P by a sia-PaciFic broaDcastin G asian MMunication centre ( aMic) chair: allan Willia Ms, l umpur Panelists: roDney PinDer, Director, i nstitute ( insi) cait McMahon, psychologist and Managing Director of the Dart c entre for Journalism and t rauma, n ew y ork, usa JahanG ir alaM akash, journalist and e xecutive Director of the Justice Foundation, b angladesh The workshop sought to oblain a better insight into the working conditions of journalists in conflict areas of Asia and explored the restrictions they face in conflict situa - tions. It focused on Bangladesh as a regional case, as well as the general question of what can be done to better ensure the safety of journalists. Moderating this session, Alan Williams, began by with a short introduction to the workshop's topic. He noted that Asia is still a region full of conflicts, e.g. in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh or Thailand. Hence journalists' daily work often takes place in the context of violent conflict. Williams then opened the floor to the panelists, who each gave a short presentation of their work. Jahangir Alam Akash opened with a video clip. He has been a human rights activist in Bangladesh since 1989 and reported that torture is a common government practice in Bangladesh. As a result of his work he has faced difficulties several times. In 2007 he was arrested and imprisoned for one month. During that time he was severely tortured and had difficulties to walk after his release. However, he did not keep quiet but made his experience public. Only international support prevented second arrest.To illustrate the conditions in Bangladesh Akash highlighted last year's election, which was marked by army atrocities, the suspension of civil rights and many civilian casualties. In Bangladesh as well, the new media present opportunities for political activists to get their message heard: As most newspapers were afraid to print his critical article, he resorted to the internet and pub - lished the article on his blog. Rodney Pinder began by pointing out that despite the economic crisis and its negative impact on the me - dia, the risks for journalists worldwide have not dimin - ished. In the first months of 2009, 31 joined the 109 killed in 2008. The difficult financial situation many media face does little to alleviate the situation for journalists, as budgets for safety training and resources are likely to be cut back. Financial constraints are also responsible for the tendency of news networks to hire stringers instead of permanent staff. Local stringers are often less well-equipped and have less extensive training on how to cope with the risks of reporting conflict. Pinder added, however, that of the 109 deaths INSI counted in 2008, the majority did not work in war or conflict zones but reported on local criminal networks Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009rePortin con Flicts - an asian P ersPective 93 92 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracyor corruption. All but five of them did not work abroad but in their local environment. South Asia in particular continues to be a dangerous environment for journalists, with three out of the top six most dangerous countries in South Asiat: Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The assassination of journalists remains a risk-free means of censorship, as nine out of ten perpetrators are not brought to justice. UN Security Council Resolution 1738, which was adopted in December 2006 and con - demns attacks against journalists in conflict situations, unfortunately did very little to improve the statistics, regretted Pinder. INSI provides safety training for jour - nalists but he insisted that this is not enough. To remedy the situation, the organization proposes a four-point plan to governments: \u00b7Support above-mentioned UN Security Council resolution. \u00b7Take a country's record into account when deciding aid programs. \u00b7Include safety training in all government-funded training for journalists. \u00b7Develop a long-term strategy to emphasize safety and security in media development. Cait McMahon worked as a counselor before she became interested in the subject area of trauma and journalism. She has conducted extensive research in this area. Journalists, said McMahon, are a high-risk trauma group. Not only do they often witness atrocious crimes or accidents, but many are also ill prepared to deal with the psychological stress their work entails. For obvious reasons, this is particularly true for those who report on war and conflict. Around 25 percent of all journalists suffer from some form of post traumatic stress disorder, many of them not being aware of their condition. McMahon emphasized the link between high-qual - ity journalism and good training on how to deal with trauma, concluding that healthy journalists make healthy journalism. The Dart Centre for Journalism and Trauma thus offers free training to journalists both to protect themselves and to enable them to spread their knowledge to colleagues. McMahon was asked whether there was a new theoretical focus in journalistic training to heal defect democracies. She replied that the training they provide only touches on the psychological aspects of reporting conflict. Discussion One audience member from Pakistan inquired whether a journalist can be an activist at the same time. Pinder agreed that this is a very difficult question. While there is a long European tradition to combine both roles it has lead to a higher number of journalist casualties, particu - larly in an increasingly polarized world. He added that journalists must not always be impartial, as long as they realize the dangers that are involved and have received good training. The same audience member asked the panelists for their opinion on recent developments in Pakistan, where the secret service ISI has started an inquiry against a sup - posed 'traitor' who worked close to the Taliban. Pinder observed that traditionally \"the military doesn't like journalists\", but that journalists need to stay independent from the conflict parties. Another participant wanted to know how to handle emotional situations with traumatized witnesses. McMa - hon made clear that there is no recipe for such situations. One useful strategy, however, is to give back the power to decide to the victims, as they have often been in a situation of powerlessness. In an emotional situation the journalist could for example ask, \"Do you want to go on?\" A participant member from Thailand asked Akash what motivated him to report on conflicts despite the risks that it involves. Akash said he felt compelled to answer the calls of people who need help. | Christof Koegler hoW can technolo Gies an D inForMation be levera GeD to ManaGe crises better ? hoste D by ict 4Peace chair: alain Mo Doux, former a ssistant Director-General of unesco for Freedom of e xpression, Democracy and Peace, Geneva, s witzerland Panelists: Daniel s tauFFacher, c hairman, ict 4Peace, Geneva, witzerland soon- honG chief i nformation t echnology, u nited n ations, n ew y ork, usa satish naM biar, Force commander and head of the united nations forces in the former yugoslavia 1992-1993, united service institution of i ndia, n ew Delhi, i ndia Alain Modoux suggested that while there was much information in numerous problem areas, within any given region there was a lack of sharing of information among stakeholders. As such ICT has a role to play to facilitate better communication among both regional and international organizations. Daniel Stauffacher detailed the origins of ICT4Peace in the Geneva summit of 2003, where it was considered that the ICT4 development initiative should be extend - ed. ICT4peace was established with the aims of policy reform, training, and inventory creation. In its capac - ity as a policy development research think tank, it was therefore very important, Stauffacher noted, that heads of state be engaged from the start. Satish Nambiar proceeded to outline the context for peacekeeping, namely, misplaced civilians, humanitar - ian relief and damaged infrastructure. He mentioned a few reasons why the military was necessary to carry out many of these operations: it is equipped to face danger, it is aggressive in oppressive situations against spoilers, it makes civilians feel secure and it is in a position to prevent conflict. However, the presence of the military also involved several tensions, for example its shallow roots due to short-term presence, a \"black and white mentality\", a prerequisite of conformity, minimal local consultation and low finesse. Nambiar suggested addressing four relationships: the military and civilian bureaucracy, the military and the United Nations, the United Nations and humanitarian agencies, and the UN mission and external agencies such as the media. He called for greater interaction and for closing the gap between civilian agencies and the mili - tary. Daniel Stauffacher presented the contribution by Sanjana Hattotuwa (special advisor to ICT4Peace) in his absence. He presented the example of Ushahid, a website using user-generated reports and Google Maps, created to gather citizen-generated crisis information after the post-election violence in Kenya and accessible either via mobile telephones or online. It is an incident inventory (damages, attacks, infrastructure updates) mapped at the local scale. Users were both readers and providers.

Other agencies are protective of their sources to prevent the exploitation and misuse of their information. There is sensitivity around certain words such as 'intelligence' whose con - notations thus exclude it from the UN's official use, in addition to other words and terms which are not easily standardized across different organizations such that cer - tain terms might lead to stigmatization. Examples like 'victim' can set up negative psychological situations. It was also suggested that civilians in the area needed tools to express themselves, such as Radio Okapi, the peace radio in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In defense of the proposed UN database, Choi responded that the information need not be totally comprehensive. He stated that it was most important to have basic, reliable and up-to-date information available as, once people find it useful, momentum will build and will in turn encourage greater use and sharing. Other participants mentioned other information management problems. Government restrictions are often the strongest prohibitions on information-sharing. It would be difficult to integrate the military in infor - mation-sharing for many of the tensions Nambiar pre - sented. If the UN database was accessible to all agencies, including commercial ones, there is the possibility it will lead to the commercialization of information. However, as most of the basic information is free of charge, Choi remarked, the information will not be bought. In addi - tion tools like Google Maps are examples of free infor - mation from a corporate source. He contended that the main problem is not the information but improving its use. At the technical level of information management, Choi suggested that there should be two data frequen - cies. A narrow time frame for immediate response data on the ground such as infrastructure damage, popula - tion movement and such, should be updated regularly where certain agencies will have to take responsibility. A longer time frame to aid prevention will include infor - mation such as weather reports, climate information and geographical knowledge. It will be necessary to narrow the database down to ten countries to begin with before expanding the project. However, an audience member responded that up- to-date information was difficult to contribute when basic facilities are often absent so that public access is not always a simple matter. Furthermore divisions in access to the information could lead to divisions further along the line. Choi answered that certain locations with bet - ter access could become hubs of connectivity if people reported back their information, thus these locations also aid the synchronization of information. Furthermore, it would be better to deal with it on a case-by-case basis and tailor it to the technology at hand; for example cer - tain areas might be able to use mobile phones more. | Maayan Ashkenazi Some of its advantages compared to other informa - tion management systems are that it is crowd-sourced and verifiable, there is greater interoperability and it is designed for scalability. This system was compared to the UN which tended to be agency-focused and inward- looking. Soon-Hong Choi highlighted that carrying out rescue operations requires a good data set and crisis needs information. The pillars of the UN are peace and security, humanitarian relief and development. However there is a lack of information on mission sites. Because each agency has its own structure there is often a lack of understanding and bad integration. His objective, he said, was to bring discipline to data collection. In essence to ask \"what's the critical data set?\" For example, basic information such as an area's susceptibility to natural disasters would help with early warning and the preparation for action. He proposed a databank which would be accessible to each agency at all times since time of crisis is too late for coordination. Data and technology, he stated, are the cornerstones. There should be an international standard so that it is still accessible with low bandwidth. The obvious tools to hand are geographical information systems and mobile phones. The aim will be to have a good search engine, with training for participating countries and simulations of situations for both agencies and countries. Altogether this information management tool would build the capacity of the international community to deal with crises better and it would be a great aid for holistic crisis management, which encompasses prevention, early warning, and recovery. The database should be up and running in six to nine months. There will be eclectic and multiple stakeholders. Discussion The discussion focused on two main themes. The first involved communication as a political and social issue; the negotiation, translation, compatibility and sensitiv - ity of information. The second concerned information-sharing as a technological problem. A wide variety of reasons for a lack of information- sharing was presented by the audience. The Internation - al Community of the Red Cross (ICRC), for example, has access to areas if it keeps quiet.

Media in those countries are controlled by the state and regimes use it to spread propaganda. Leon Willems talked about his work in Sudan where he was responsible for negotiating with the authori - ties a possibility of setting up an independent media for the United Nations. However, the state did not want to share media, especially with Darfur. Willems, main objective by setting up the Radio Darfur Network was to empower people, as they were not even aware of what was happening in their own country. He also stressed the fact that people in Sudan did not trust radio for a number of reasons. The news and priorities of programs were censored by the state. Also, there was no audience participation and senior management positions were limited to one party. Thus, Radio Darfur was to be 'run' by people of Darfur. Another problem was Sudan's ethnic fragmentation with approximately 120 languages spoken. So, local languages were needed in the radio, as not all Sudanese speak Arabic. The central desk of Radio Darfur is located in the Netherlands, while in Sudan a network of reporters has been set up. Willems explained that although Sudan is hostile to freedom of the press, journalists do not get killed, and there are not so many physical threats; however there have been cases of jour - nalists being jailed. Following this, he presented how this initiative works in reality. The project was launched in April 2008 and in December 2008, the radio started broadcasting. It turned out to be a great success and currently, the radio is the number one service in Sudan. When it was established it used to broadcast for one hour per day over seven days, while at the moment it is on the average three hours per day and negotiations are taking place to increase that. The radio uses various frequen - cies for the following reasons: most people receive radio through SW; it covers all the areas where there are refugees; it is much safer, as it is not a target for a take- over or violence. The radio provides accurate news and current affairs; security and assistance; relevant informa - tion for refugees and displaced people; health develop - Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009\"crackin G close D Doors! - the case o F iran, su Dan an D bur Ma 99 98 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracyment and education; interactive dialogue at grassroots level. Most importantly, there are confirmed reports that community listening groups have been created. Willems also touched upon an issue of legitimacy and accountability of big operations, like Radio Darfur which take place from outside Sudan and stressed the following. First, media should be beneficial to the people you try to assist. Second, the project should be validated by the people who listen to the radio. Third, the own - ership of the radio will be transferred to the people of Sudan as soon as it is possible. Radio Darfur plays a cru - cial role, especially because foreign reporting has been effectively stopped in Darfur. Bijan Moshaver outlined Radio Zamaneh's history and main objectives. As an independent and non-parti - san Iranian radio station, it is based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. He emphasized the fact that PressNow, an NGO supporting independent media in regions of con - flict, is a co-initiator and a great supporter of Radio Za - maneh. Dedicated to such values as freedom of speech, human rights, and ethical journalism, the radio targets in particular young Iranians to give them a voice and \"open new horizons in viewing the issues inside Iran\". It is also the first Persian language broadcaster asking its audience to interact and participate. The radio is a big success and the number of visitors to its website in March 2008 rose to five million from the initial one million in January 2007. Moshaver also underlined the fact that the radio is a platform for young Iranian bloggers keen of publicly voice their opinions. The project has strong support amongst Iranian youth, mostly liked due to its diversity. Young people find it both different and balanced, most importantly far from being politically-orientated. Nafis Nia said that Radio Zamaneh is like a new - born child. She spoke about monitoring based on such aspects as journalistic principles, structure, and cohesion of programs, mission, and target group. She highlighted that one of the main objectives of Radio Zamaneh is breaking taboos and how important it is to have human- interest stories. When asked about the future of Radio Zamaneh, she was very positive about it. In particular that young Iranians want change with more space and freedom. Thus Radio Zamaneh plays an important role by stimulating people to take part in shaping the future of Iran. Maung Maung Myint talked about the situa - tion of the media in Burma and the difficulties in news broadcasting. He provided an overview of Burmese his - tory and painted a picture of the media during respective periods. Basically, when Burma gained independence from the British Empire the media was free. None of the newspapers were controlled and 'Golden Years' prevailed for the Burmese media. All of that changed in 1962 when the military regime took over. All newspapers were nationalized and 'owned' by the military. This has not changed with changing governments up until today. Journalists cannot publish anything the government does not agree with. Myint agreed that the situation is depressing but negated that it is hopeless. He highlighted that there is a small niche of private journalists who can work with exile media. Discussion The discussion concentrated on media from exile and ways of 'cracking closed doors' in countries with re - gimes hostile to free media like Burma, Sudan and, Iran. Myint accentuated that people living in rural areas do not have a good perception of foreign media and are reluctant to believe the information they provide. The panelists discussed with the audience the issue of legiti - macy, ways of supporting media in repressive regimes and whether the exiled media would have survived had they come into existence a decade ago. In conclusion the panelists emphasized that the future of the media is directly linked to the impact it has and the undertaking of small initiatives that tackle big issues. | Karolina Grzybvision an D Mission o F MeDica M auser, founder of medica mondiale, Germany Asked to create a title for her presentation, Monika Hauser suggested two: \"I want the world to know\", and \"The duty of care and empathetic support.\" She stressed that she wants the world to know about the psychologi - cal, physical, and social implications affecting women and girls who have been sexually violated or suffer from other forms of gender-based violence during war and civil conflict. medica mondiale, an international, non- governmental human rights organization, providing interdisciplinary medical, psychological, economic, and legal support to victims takes care that these women and girls are not left to their own devices. One of the most striking approaches of this organization is to let women who have experienced trauma gain the support of other women who empathetically share similar experiences. Hauser used photograps and the sotries related to them to illustrate the work of medica mondiale. Legal Mediation Center, Afghanistan Founded three years ago, medica mondiale's legal me - diation center in Kabul enables women to seek legal advice. In a region where patriarchy and regional cus - tomary laws prevail, the medica mondiale center is open to women who have survived violence, abuse, and child marriage, to learn about their rights and access legal counseling. Posters and radio broadcasts are provided throughout the region to display the criminality of such offenses and offer legal counseling. medica mondiale takes a bottom-up approach by train - ing local professionals to eventually become independent counselors of victims of violence and sexual abuse. Em - pathetic support is provided in their counseling pro - grams, where local professionals who have experienced similar traumatization, learn to deal with their own trauma and are taught how to improve their counseling of their patients. Hauser showed a photo of women and children in an Afghan prison where they were taken because of viola - tions of moral rules jailed many had fled their homes and were jailed by police who have no files and no scheduled procedures. By providing beds, lawyers and a kindergar - ten for the children, medica mondiale aims to offer legal advice and support during the occupants' incarceration. Each case is now documented, and women who have suffered procedural mistakes have been set free. The real effort, however, involves mediation with victims' neighbors and families to explain the reasoning behind their flight, to prevent them from being killed when returning home. medica mondiale also works to train police, judges and prison staff to follow UN standards for prisoners. Getting the authorities to understand involves speaking about the patriarchal system face to face and even asking them to imagine what they would do if it happened to their own daughters.

They also receive support through training programs, including job and literacy programs, which are coordinated with other countries and aid programs. Hauser pointed to the look of dignity of the women's posture in a photograph of a woman with her children, claiming that the amount of support these women need in order to start with their lives again is very small but vital for their recovery. Hauser presented information to the audience about rape and sexual crimes: \u00b7Rape is not just trauma for the day it happens, but has lifelong consequences. \u00b7Many rapw survivors experience disassociation. During rape, many women experience leaving their bodies, seeing the event like an outsider. This self- protection mechanism has implications later on, so for one woman, the smell of a man's sweat made her physically ill as it reminded her of being raped in prison camps. \u00b7Women become connected with their perpetrator for all their life. Dealing with the implications of rape can be managed through support and caring families. If negative stigma is experienced from peers, feelings of isolation can heighten the effects of trauma. \u00b7Women of all ages are raped. \u00b7Men are also raped. As one of the biggest taboos, no - body wants to speak about it. When men are unable to speak about it and receive no support, it can often lead to violence. Male rape is not about homosexual - ity. It is about exploitation. \u00b7Humiliation practices, often paralleled with rape during war, intensify trauma. Suggestions for journalists when dealing with trauma victims \u00b7Talk about what happens during war with women and children - not just big headlines \u00b7Show respect and dignity. During the Bosnian wars, journalists barged into refugee camps to get stories, bringing about serious implications for refugees. \u00b7Don't give details. It heightens re-traumatization risk. \u00b7Don't pay more for more details. \u00b7 Keep your sources anonymous - otherwise the con - sequence can be murder. Do not use victims' names or voices. \u00b7 Give the victims time. Speaking right after trauma risks re-traumatization. \u00b7 Victims need psycho-social support. Be prepared for dealing with trauma before going into war zones. \u00b7 Stories can traumatize journalists - prepare your - selves first. Your own traumas can re-traumatize victims. \u00b7 Consider her legal case. Sometimes, giving inter - views to journalists can make a woman's tribunal statement invalid. \u00b7 Sex is not the right word. Rape has nothing to do with sex. The right term is gender-based violence and sexual exploitation. | Courtney Fostertized patients, to prevent re-traumatization, and to re - port and refer them. Referring traumatized women and girls to the right treatment offers a multi-dimensional approach to care while minimizing feelings of helpless - ness by staff. There are, however, insufficient resources for multi-dimensional care in Afghanistan. When medica mondiale asked women to create hats telling the world something it should see, one woman wrote, \"Stop Rape.\" medica mondiale is not just about providing medical care, but also about providing women with psycho-social support by building a support net - work of people they can talk to most of whom who have gone through the same. As 70 percent of women in Liberia survived sexual violence, medica mondiale coor - dinates task forces with UNCR and NGOs to develop better support models. A particular challenge in the judicial system, however, is that even when perpetrators are imprisoned, they often make payments to judges or victims' family members to withdraw their case. medica mondiale provides job training to women, such as weaving, sewing, and cooking. Since holding a job builds self-confidence, it is a critical aspect in the recov - ery process and can actually minimize chances of future exploitation. Since Kosovan society is very patriarchal, many women can't come to the women's center alone. Therefore, medica mondiale has an ambulance to pick up the women, and often their families, too. In Kosovo medica mondiale offers job training, such as apiculture and driving. Only few women get a chance to participate in drivers training, because many hus - bands prohibit them from driving with other men in the car, even if the man is an instructor. The idea is that if women start these jobs, paying 300-400 eiros per month, they can put pressure on their brothers in laws to let their sisters drive, too. Hence, the goal is for women to become change agents themselves. A women's center was opened in Goma, DR Congo, to support traumatized women who had been raped dur - ing the civil wars. Not only were they raped by rebels, Hauser emphasized, but also by UN soldiers.

There is an unpredictable speed of change but content will always need to be audience-driven. He suggested that the BBC would have had a very limited lifespan if it had not expanded into new media. The question is one of reach, and as long as the content is relevant and used, the TV license is justified. He argued that in reality there was no conflict between the two media forms because without new media, traditional media would have become irrelevant. Using the example of Singapore, P. N. Balji com - mented that contrary to Weber, traditional media was still the dominant form of media consumption since it has been impossible to monetize new media, although there is an awareness that the new media from the USA, what was dubbed 'a tsunami', is on the horizon. Despite quite high broadband connection, the reach, especially outside the cities, is relatively poor. Citing the cases of Vietnam, India and China, he suggested that new media will take a long time to penetrate due to the low levels of broadband access and the strong profits enjoyed by traditional media. Axel Schmiegelow agreed that the tsunami metaphor was apt, especially in reference to the phenomenal adop - tion rate in Korea. He went on to say that different new media forms were not in conflict with each other. While there was still the problem of monetization, if the con - tent on offer had relevance then people would be more willing to pay for targeted advertising. Nick Brambring provided the example that people were willing to pay for relevant content by stating that through geo-targeting and providing live content, his company had five million people on its books. The geo- Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009Plenary P anel: M ultiMeDia revolution an D the tra Ditional M eDia 105 104 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracytargeting kept broadcasts within the licensing boundar - ies. Salim Amin outlined how similar transformations were occurring in Africa. He mentioned how new tech - nologies had a fast uptake if they proved to be useful. He suggested that fiber optic connectivity would revolution - ize the media landscape yet again. Addressing monetiza - tion, Amin mentioned that more and more advertisers were interested in pan-African access. In reference to the state of traditional media he cited high levels of internal trading and numerous channels but very little relevant content. Cristiana Falcone addressed the nature of the new versus traditional division by stating that the real ques - tion was whom we consider to be the media. She called for a non-partisan approach and that the World Econom - ic Forum should be about media interaction. She used the examples of podcasts, second life meetings and the ability of other online forms to establish conversations as a way to integrate more questions and debates. Newspa - pers, she explained, were not about the paper but about the news and importantly still had a role in contextual - izing the kinds of flash news reports so readily and freely available elsewhere. Schmiegelow added whereas previously feedback was limited to the readers' page, there was now greater inter - action with users, resulting in an expansion of content. Discussion Weber contended that if traditional media dies, it will be because they have stuck to their old distribution chan - nels rather than focusing on content. In the next three to four years, the important change, he predicted, will be the new media's jump from the study to the living room. Broadband-enabled TV will compete with the whole internet. Yet as the internet expands, relative consump - tion has tended to decline, thus brands will survive in a sea of choice. Furthermore brands are often dependent on their visibility offline. The Seattle Post was cited as an example where once its print issue ceased, its online readership dropped. Live TV, too, was still important in bringing the nation together during important events. Brambring agreed and provided the further example that use of his website indeed went up at peak TV watching periods, not just for live events but also for program epi - sodes. Schmiegelow experienced similar peaks for live television. One explanation he suggested was the ability to deconstruct episodes online. A participant then suggested that a blend of old and new media for a broader news cover was necessary. Every story should have multiple platforms and thus editors and journalists should integrate. Schmiegelow replied, using the example of Moscow, that the connection and device usage in different layers of society is uneven. On the other hand, he mentioned the example of Twitter. Due to the accessibility of information and the ability to rapidly diffuse it within a selected group, Twitter has been used by groups to chal - lenge authority in several cases. Thus new drivers for usage are appearing. Another participant contributed that while we assume new media is only taken up by the youth, even old people use it. Falcone replied that this is especially true when media takes a mixed approach, such as providing news via mobile telephones. Balji agreed, and argued that journalists are destroying journalism because the presentation and hierarchies are outdated. Schmiegelow also agreed and called for the end of the editor-in-chief. The Iraq war was a turning point, he stated, and com - pared Fox News' pro-war coverage to the images of excesses and abuses broadcast on YouTube. Schmiegelow went on to posit that the structure of navigating content had changed so much that it was important to reinstate the art of the sub-line. Weber acknowledged that jour - nalism needed to change but defended the role of edi - tors, stating that journalistic discipline, corroboration and checking of facts was vital for news credibility and protection of any brand. A participant concerned with the decline of news - papers asked how investigative journalism would other - wise be funded. Does this leave the responsibility with the BBC and a few others? Amin suggested that the way things were reported needed to change; local reporters were cheaper and should be favored over parachute jour - nalism. Falcone added that journalism is the watchdog of democracy. On the issue of neutrality brought up by another au - dience member, Amin stated that \"hate exacerbates\" and that some sort of filter was still needed. Schmiegelow asked whether one could hold the media accountable. What was needed, he suggested, was plurality. Another audience member asked about quality main - tenance and connectivity. On the issue of connectivity, Schmiegelow predicted that we would see many new formats. Balji suggested there would be a change in the business model; there will be fewer players, possibly an endowment and many more not for profit. In contrast, Weber suggested that without the commercial media, news would become too static. Furthermore there were too many hoaxes and difficulties for only a few organi - zations to take responsibility of filtering. Schmiegelow suggested more new types and formats will come about, especially blends. | Maayan Ashkenazi Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009Plenary P anel: M ultiMeDia revolution an D the tra Ditional M eDia 107 106 WorkshoPs on MeDia FreeDoM, transP arency , DeMocracyworkshops on media in afri Ca108 (neW) M eDia an D DiasPora intervention in conFlict resolution : the case o F soMalia hoste D by Deutsche Welle chair: christo Pher sPrin Gate, journalist, DW- tv, Germany Panelists: M, founder of the i nternet portal , l ondon Moha MeD hairman of s habelle.net, s omalia oMar Faruk osMan, journalist, s omalia thoMas s cheen, a frica correspondent, F az, Germany Christopher Springate opened the panel with an audio- visual film introducing the regional focus, Somalia. The presentation contrasted with the pictures broadcast by the international press in the West, namely that of pirates armed with grenade launchers, Kalashnikovs and pow - erful motorboats. The film unfolded Somalia's natural treasures but also stated that development of the beauti - ful land into tourist destinations is impossible for now. The country is in a civil war between warlords and their militias and has had no functioning central government for 18 years. Those who fled the country are now form - ing the diaspora. The relationship of the diaspora with Somalia includes inter alia close contacts with relatives, investments in Somalia, sending of remittances. But most importantly in respect of our theme, the diaspora has set up a host of media outlets broadcasting into the country via multimedia channels.. The presenta - tion ended with the central question: \"Peace-Makers or Peace-Wrecker: what role for the media of Somalia's diaspora?\" The workshop was conducted as an open discussion to which Springate set lead questions. The panelists were purposely divided into two groups with different points of view - two in favor of the diaspora's actions (Gassem and Scheen) and two representatives of Somalia's (local) media (Adow and Osman). Springate asked the panelists: \"What role are the Somali diaspora media playing in Somalia, and why?\" and continued: \"What role should the Somali diaspora media be playing?\" He directly addressed Abbas Gassem, the founder of the diaspora news webpage (insidesoma - lia.org), with the question whether this platform is part of the problem or the solution? Gassem clearly affirmed the diaspora media to be part of the solution. He contin - ued that the diaspora is trying to educate people and tell them what is happening in their country. Especially by means of such internet platforms the diaspora is able to reach out to many people and get messages across with little cost implications: \"The Power is no longer in the few but rather the many.\" Gassem considered the role of the diaspora is to rise and unite people by using the new media as means to bring peace, prosperity, education as well as health to the country and eventually push Soma - lia in the new century. Mohamed Amiin Adow countered by accusing the diaspora of being as divided as the people. He contended that the diaspora media is not really helping what is hap - pening on the ground. Even though he recognized the role of the diaspora in emergency cases, where they are sometimes helpful to disseminate information, Adow generally stressed such platforms would play a destruc - tive role. According to him, the diaspora is aligned with particular clans in the same way as everybody in the country is. By spreading news on the internet they give primacy to their tribes. This 'tribal primacy' aggravates the general situation. Adow admitted that the informa - tion provided by the local media in Somalia in many instances is also affiliated to specific tribes but he un - derlined that people in Somalia could freely choose the information they access. Besides, the media is generally committed to giving reasonable views, he continued. Adow further emphasised the traditional media to be more reliable while at the same time people are en - abled to comment on everything and provide feedback. Thomas Scheen drew attention to Somalia becoming an increasingly inaccessible and most dangerous country for (international) journalists so \"we need whatever media we can get.\". This situation is a reflection of the Somali society, Scheen summarized. The next questions posed by Springate were: \"Has new technology / new media affected the situation, and if so, how?\" and \"How could the international commu - nity be assisting them?\" As seen by Omar Faruk Osman, \"the new media is playing a negative role because it has increased unprofessionalism\". More than 300 homepages have been set up by people worldwide with the objec - tive of promoting their tribes/clans constantly damag - ing the Somali society, he continued. Today, Somalia is facing ideological division and is controlled by 34 warlords exacerbating the overall situation. Osman even accused the diaspora of collecting money in order to Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009(neW) MeDia an D DiasPora intervention in con Flict resolution: the case o F soMalia 111 110 Worksho Ps on M eDia in a Fricasupport warlords and/or that warlords fund the diaspora media to be favored in the news coverage in return. Some homepages even have clan names clearly advanc - ing their respective warlords in whatever they broadcast. He criticized the diaspora media and pointed out that he needs to know what is going to happen in Mogadi - shu rather than having someone sitting in Gothenburg telling him what his clan is going to do or did last night. This appraisement was supported by Adow who accused the diaspora people of sending 'bullet money' to their respective clans. Gassem emphasized the importance for the diaspora media to carefully consider what is being put on the homepages; however, he calls upon people to go beyond what is available on the internet. In doing so the dias - pora is trying to create social networks where people are enabled to exchange their views: \"It is better to argue on the net than it is with bullets on the streets of Moga - dishu,\" he concluded. Scheen supported this conclusion by stating it is more important to create awareness about the overall problems in the media than about pirates as has been done recently: \"The more the diaspora me - dia contribute to raising awareness the better it is,\" he explained. Gassem stressed the new media will play an important role in Somalia in the future as it offers so many solutions and is not yet tapped to its full potential. \"I hope the bullets will run out and the people will start discussing,\" Gassem concluded. Osman called upon the international community to help. He reported that, while the international com - munity neglects Somalia, pirates are locally celebrated as national heroes. Osman further emphasized that the situation has to be solved on the ground and not on the ocean: \"The Somalia problem is no longer only our problem, it is an international problem.\" Adow added that Somalia has recently turned into a safe haven for terrorists, for instance Al-Qaeda. Besides, Ethiopia and Eritrea are constantly fighting in Somalia which causes further destabilization. Discussion The participants expressed their appreciation to the panelists for a fascinating and interesting discussion. One participant pointed out that Somalia is among the top ten worst places in the word for journalists. In terms of 'murdered journalists' it ranks second just behind Iraq. Osman explained that journalists are targeted because of what they say or write. He referred to the four jour - nalists murdered only this year and concluded not only journalists but everybody is targeted: \"We need peace for ordinary people but they are being held hostage by warlords and moneylords,\" he stated. However, one participant pointed out the blame should not only be on the international community because in his opinion the Somali government could have solved problems earlier without foreign interference. And he questioned why all these homepages never reported on the presence of Al-Qaeda terrorists in Somalia. Adow mentioned the murder of a director who reported on this threat. Never - theless he assured that journalists are absolutely brave to report. Another participant confirmed that the problem of Somalia is very complex for the media as there is a lack of respect for journalists and the work they do. In addition to that she raised the question if meetings or means of fostering the dialogue between the diaspora and the local media have been envisaged by the Union of Somali Journalists. Osman underlined their efforts to bring people together. On the other hand, he stressed most owners of media do not understand anything about professionalism or independent reporting. If people already support their warlords it is nearly impossible to change their minds, he argued. Finally Springate thanked the panelists and the audience for the interesting and fruitful discussion and concluded: \"It is a vital task to raise awareness about the situation in Somalia.\" | Patrick Falliscoverin G con Flicts in liberia hoste D by the i nstitute o F aPP lieD Me Dia stuDies ( iaM) o F zurich u niversity o F aPP lieD sciences ( zhaW) sPeaker: christo Ph sP urk, media researcher at ia M, switzerland Introducing IAM's research project in Liberia, Christoph Spurk stated that two studies aim to gain empirical evi - dence of the function of media in a post-conflict situa - tion. IAM took on the users' perspective by asking what users expect from the media and in how far the content provided matches the expectations. Both studies concen - trate on radio listeners and content since the medium is the most important mass medium in Liberia. Research was conducted in cooperation with the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building in Monrovia. He continued with the presentation of the research design and main results of the first study that was con - cluded in November 2007. The research built on in - terviews with audience focus groups of Liberian radio listeners. Interviews were recorded and transcribed and a qualitative content analysis of transcripts followed. The main result of the analysis was that listeners de - mand high-quality radio content. This positive surprise, according to the presenter, could be verified because focus group participants touched upon quality-related expectations in response to different questions, such as their favorite station or most trusted station, expected topics, or shortcomings concerning coverage. Illustrat - ing the process, Spurk described that a participant nam - ing a radio station as his favorite would subsequently be asked for the reasons. Many participants mentioned criteria like 'exact', 'real' or 'accurate' news, balanced and independent information or up-todate and in-depth coverage. These answers were analyzed as being related to quality. Moreover, Spurk asserted that there is a relation between favorite stations mentioned and the findings of a radio content analysis using 'quality indicators' con -ducted in early 2007. Indicators were, among others, the number of sources per news item, the diversity of sourc - es or the amount of background reporting. Comparing the favorite stations mentioned due to their quality with those stations with high scores in 'quality indicators' shows overlapping results. Tis convinces, Spurk of the relevance of his data. What listeners' expect radio programs to cover was the next question presented. The results are based on a comparison between a study depicting personal concerns of Liberians and the results of the content analysis re - garding expected topics. Development, security, educa - tion and reconciliation are the highest-ranking personal concerns of Liberians. Accordingly, the study found that these topics are also expected to be covered on the radio. However, listeners do expect politics as a topic in addi - tion to their personal concerns. Spurk finished this sec - tion by pointing out the most striking result: Although listeners mentioned reconciliation often as a personal concern, they also held that it should appear less on the radio. Apparently, the topic is regarded as too sensitive for the radio. Finally, he commented on the limits of the method. Pointing out that questions regarding activities, behavior or a change of knowledge and attitude after radio listen - ing did not produce tangible results, he concluded that this research setting was not conducive for such findings. Concluding, he summarized the most striking results: 1. There is a hunger for reliable high-quality infor - mation. 2. The radio audience is very active, which leads to an agenda setting role of the radio. Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009coverlin G con Flicts in liberia 113 112 Worksho Ps on M eDia in a Frica3. Relevant topics are personal concerns plus politics but \"less\" reconciliation. Responding to questions from participants he comment - ed on possible reasons for a lack of trust in radio stations and the challenges for empirical research in Africa. As suggested from the audience, government funding can be a reason for suspicion towards a broadcaster. He went on to concede that there is a male bias in the focus groups and that all participants live in Monrovia (the capital). While this is not ideal, he was pleased to have reached a wide social strata. He clarified that lacking in - frastructure, language differences and the dire economic situation in Liberia are challenging for any research. It is difficult, for example, to convince working persons to leave their job and come in for an interview. Spurk continued by presenting on the ongoing second study. Its objective is to obtain empirical evidence of dif-ferences between radio and newspaper reporting, explicit 'peace-oriented' stations and 'quality' journalism and the fulfillment of audience expectations, among others. The study centers on content analysis. Researchers documented the stories of every news broadcast of ten radio stations and four newspapers over a period of six weeks. Subsequently, stories to be in - cluded in the study were chosen according to the topic groups 'peace', 'conflict' and 'development'. The groups themselves comprise themes and Reconcili - ation Commission' (TRC) or 'corruption'. Only select stories were transcribed for assessment. The researchers developed two groups of criteria that information pieces from the transcripts are to be attributed to: 1. basic criteria of journalistic reporting, 2. specific criteria for journalism covering conflict. This research design al - lows a quantitative as well as qualitative assessment and a more in-depth analysis of single stories on the one hand. On the other, it is time and resource consuming. Ac - cordingly, assessments are still in progress. Starting to outline tentative results, Spurk first stated a trend to large quality differences between radio sta - tions. In his opinion, this quality gap will effectively curtail attempts to draw tangible conclusions on more detailed differences in reporting between peace-oriented reporting and quality journalism. As he pointed out one conclusion could be that peace journalism does not exist. But such a conclusion cannot be drawn without con - sidering the difficulties encountered with the research design. So not all broadcasts could be completed and some explicit 'peace journalism' protagonists are hardly presented in the sample. Second, media do not fulfill their role of analysis and in-depth reporting. This failure is most strikingly illustrated by the fact that no journalist touched upon the causes of armed conflict in reporting. Furthermore, reports about TRC hearings were rather covering the opening session than the actual hearing and no assessed media explained the TRC process well enough to be fully comprehended. On the positive side, some talk shows performed exceptionally high quality reporting. Thus, he asked: \"Do talk shows get the right attention by media support organizations?\" Responding to a question from the audience, Spurk said that the unsatisfactory coverage of topics important for conflict prevention cannot be imputed to censorship. This, however, did not mean that journalistic rights are not violated in Liberia. Concluding, Spurk called for a monitoring system of media content to improve the effectiveness of media support. Based on the argument that content analysis is a valid monitoring methodology, he suggested to comple - ment existing indicators with new 'quality indicators' developed through his applied research. Clarifying with Spurk that this suggestion does entail an empirical research study in each case, one audi - ence member commented on the suggestion cautiously with regard to feasibility. In response, Spurk suggested that local NGOs could conduct the necessary research. In his opinion, international experts are not necessarily more effective in fulfilling this task. | Kristina von Petersdorff Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009coverlin G con Flicts in liberia 115 114 Worksho Ps on M eDia in a Fricathe M obile P hone as con Flict Prevention tool hoste D by v oices o F aFrica Me Dia Foun Dation Panelists henri aalDers, Program Manager, v oices of a frica, t he n etherlands oliver nyirubuG ara, Project c oordinator, v oices of a frica mobile reporting project, t he n etherlands PiM De Wit, Managing Director, v oices of a frica Media Foundation, t he n etherlands Since their invention, mobile phones have been designed to improve voice communication for individuals in distant locations. Today, with their compact size, mobile phones have added capabilities; not only can these savvy devices call other phones but they can send text mes - sages, take pictures, record videos, and browse the web. With a plethora of functions, the modern mobile phone has the capacity to act as a multimedia news gathering - tool that can measure the political, economic, and social conditions in various locations. Across Africa the mobile phone has been essential in reporting on existing and culminating conflicts. Pim de Wit began the workshop by introducing his panel. Oliver Nyirubugara presented on the technol - ogy and advantages of mobile reporting. To aid in the presentation, three young mobile journalists from Africa provided insight on their experiences as \"mobile report - ers\" - or \"camjo\" (an abbreviation formed from the words cameraman and journalist). Daniel Nana Aforo from Accra, Ghana, Peris Wairimu from Nairobi, Ke - nya, and Walter Nana Wilson from Buea, Cameroon, contributed to the discussion. de Wit began by referencing the mission of Voices of Africa Media Foundation. He stated that the founda - tion intends to identify talented young men and women throughout Africa and train them to become camjos. The foundation provides aspiring journalists with technologically sophisticated mobile phones capable of capturing video and audio. Once they have taken their footage, they are able to publish files on the internet. All information is posted on the website, whether the video files are of good or bad quality. de Wit went on to men - tion that all journalists receive training and a monthly allowance to initiate their assignments. Nyirubugara then intervened to explain to the audience what mobile reporting is. Recording of news materials via sound, pictures, videos, and text writing are all methods which are used to capture live images. He exhibited a mobile device to the audience and proved that the technology was user friendly and not as intimi - dating as phones from the past. While the theme of the workshop dealt with the ways in which a mobile phone can be used as a conflict prevention tool, the founda - tion's mission was to mainly allow Africans to report on local developments, whether positive or negative. Nyirubugara then intends how mobile phone reports are made. They are made in distinct communities by in - dividuals who know them best. Themes of these videos address education, conflict, the environment, sports, and other community-related activities. Nyirubugara men - tioned that it is the local citizens who are best suited to follow up on community events. Western journalists, on the other hand, often fail to capture the essence of com - munity affairs due to a lack of local knowledge. Aforo, Wairimu and Wilson displayed examples of the sorts of reporting they conducted in their respective Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009the M obile P hone as con Flict P revention tool 117 116 Worksho Ps on M eDia in a Fricacommunities. A common element in their reports was that they all portrayed life in local communities. They dealt with individual families and disputes regarding local traffic violations. Such videos gave the audience a greater sense and understanding of the usefulness of such a style of reporting. This new mobile phone technology is still at the infancy stage. Capturing video is not a problem but distributing the video file is. Depending on the location, it is often difficult to gain the necessary internet access to upload a file on to the internet. Without steady and speedy access, much of the world is unable to witness the developments on the African continent. Another setback for this new type of media reporting is that most of the people who are capturing images or video are ama - teurs. They are not taken seriously by others, especially by well-trained journalists. Last, the fiber optic cable, which is not readily available in many parts of Africa, is needed to boost transfer of information. While de Wit and Nyirubugara expressed these challenges, they re - mained confident that with greater education and tech - nology, mobile reporting would be improved. Nyirubugara noted the mobile phone to be a \"clue- giving phone\". Community-based reporting gives locals the ability to report on local affairs. In a way, this technology can be seen as a \"social thermometer\". Nyirubugara demonstrated the editing function of the phone and its relative ease. He mentioned that all the buttons and symbols were large enough to see, even for less technologically-savvy persons. Questions from participants seemed to orient around the idea that the phone can be a tool for misinformation and, as a result, incite conflict rather than prevent it. Ny - irubugara and de Wit both denounced this idea. They reiterated that their foundation was established to pro - mote the positive flow of information and not the nega - tive. However, comments from the audience indicated that many were still skeptical of the type of information that can be freely distributed on the web. In conclusion, de Wit, Nyirubugara and the panel of camjos made two recommendations: First, they advo - cated an increase in the number of mobile phone jour - nalists. They contended that this was the only way to get good information despite this being a hotly debated issue. Second, they wanted to expand mobile reporting throughout Africa because many locations contended have little to no access to the internet and, as a result, are also not well reported on. The panelists expressed their optimism about improved mobile reporting given more time. | Edward Ceska PsyoPs For P eace ? a P resen - tation on the M etho DoloGy, role an D achieve Ments o F the \"G reat lakes reconcilia - tion\" Pro Ject hoste r aDio la b enevolenci Ja Panelists: Geor Ge Weiss, founder radio l a benevolencija, t he n etherlands Johann De Flan Der, international development/communication expert, b urundi. George Weiss explained where the idea of presented the Great Lake Reconciliation Radio (Radio Benevolencija) originated.The Radio has it's origins in Bosnia. It was designed in 1995 and the idea was to make audience members realize how their psychological reactions had led to the war in former Yugoslavia. The name 'Benevo - lencija' was given by the Jewish community in Sarajevo. The community was neutral and used to smuggle people out and help people in general. The group soon became multinational. They wanted to produce a talk show and make people talk about Nazi Germany in order to make them see the similarities with their situation. The talk show should encourage discussions. When peace came Radio Benevolencija was not established. It remained an idea, picked up seven years later by psychologists who went to Rwanda. After the introduction, Deflander showed a movie pro - duced and broadcast by Al Jazeera. It showed how Radio Benevolencija is operating in Rwanda.Production Milestones of Radio Benevolencija: \u00b72001 Start Development present project: Prototype production.

After the movie, Weiss explained the special situa - tion they encountered when they arrived in Rwanda. People there didn't trust the media because of the hate propaganda of Radio Mille Collines which had led to the killing of thousands of Tutsis. Deflander then explained how they tried to make Rwandans open up for the media, He said that they can open up if the media is a constructive and positive tool. They started working in Rwanda, in 2001. Psychologists were invited by the Rwandan government.

The main characters of the soap opera are created as identification figures for the people in the region. They try to influence people in a positive way and they also talk about conflicts that took place in other coun - tries so that people can identify with it. And as these issues are all presented through fiction sensitive issues can be addressed openly. Radio Benevolencija produces three serial dramas for three countries: Musekeweya (Rwanda) in Kin - yarwanda, Murikira Ukuri Kirundi, and Kumbuka Kesho (East Congo) in Swahili. Their shows are extremely popular. They reach 90 percent of all listeners in Rwanda, 50 percent in East Congo and 45 percent in Burundi, explained Deflander. He stressed that they want to change behavior with our program and that they have an impact on social rela - tionships and create intergroup relations by talking, for example, about traumas. Musekeweya listeners demon - strated a statistically significant greater understanding of the importance of trust, the importance of being an active bystander, the importance of deep and meaning - ful contact between social groups and the importance of talking in the process of trauma healing. Musekeweya listeners also reported higher levels of trust in their com - munities. Discussion: An audience member wanted to know if Radio Benevo - lencija is being censored by the governments to which Deflander answered that they have to send a CD with their broadcast to the government, 48 hours before it goes on air. But, he added, that in five years they were never censored. Weiss stressed that it is part of their message to be transparent and to involve the government and other authorities. An audience member who also operates in Africa wanted to know whether they used music as it can also be useful. Deflander regretted that they do not use a lot of music, but in Congo, their soap focuses on a rap artist. Weiss explained that their soaps use utopian situations to spread the message that disaster can be overcome. An audience member asked whether and how the program changed people's behavior and whether they had examples of practices that have changed. Deflander replied that, for instance, there were Hutus and Tutsis who set up businesses together. He explained that Hutus and Tutsi started showing the willingness to enter into dialogue with each other. Neighbors, who have never talked before, because they belong to different ethnic groups, suddenly started to great each other. It's a step by step approach. A further member from the audience wanted to hear more about the weekly soap in Rwanda. Deflander explained that the weekly drama program is about two hills and lasts 20 minutes. There are 20 35 main charac - ters and it's being produced in small and simple studios. Another audience member asked whether they had their own radio station to which Deflander stated that they buy airtime from national and private radio sta - tions. | Nadina Schwarzbeck and to bring people together, because in Rwanda, 94 percent of the population uses radio. Radio Benevolen - cija was born. The staff of Radio Benevolencija work together with a team of psychologists and journalists to restore trust and the credibility of the media. They organize public screenings, they have listening clubs and the most important tool is their weekly radio soap about the situation of Rwanda before 1994. The soap addresses sensitive issues like the genocide of 1994 and reconcilia - tion between Hutus and Tutsi. Amongst all the disasters, there is still room for joyful topics to report on such as love and friendship. Deflander, who works in Burundi, where Radio Benevolencija also operates, went on by giving an overview about the political situation of the Great Lakes area. The Great Lakes area is known for three genocides and one war. \"When you go there, you will meet a lot of distrust,\" Deflander said. Nearly all the nine million Rwandans have been traumatized. The whole Great Lakes area has been traumatized. The area is extremely overpopulated and in a country like Rwanda, victims and perpetrators confront each other all the time. The question of what one can do in such a region of- ten remains unanswered, he said. One has to understand the origins of group violence to prevent new outbreaks of conflicts. And Radio Benevolencija tries to make the listeners understand how people try to manipulate them. The staff of the Radio Benevolencija tries to make people understand the importance of trauma healing and rendering justice in order to avoid the circle of vengeance crimes. The main focus of the radio program lies on the questions of \"What do we want listeners to know?\", \"What do we want them to do?\" ,and \"What do we want listeners to feel,\" explained Deflander. The goal of Radio Benevolencija is to reverse the experiences of hate broadcast into peace broadcast and to turn radio into a positive propaganda tool. Deflander went on to explain how they oper - ate. They produce weekly soap operas and they use an elaborated E&E approach (entertainment/education) to achieve behavioral change within the population of the Great Lakes region. They develop serial dramas that fo - cus on identification with role models (positive, negative and transitional). They also focus on fictional elements that encourage politically neutral dialogue and discus - Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009PsyoPs For P eace? a P resentation on the M etho DoloGy, role an D achieve Ments o F the ... 121 120 Worksho Ps on M eDia in a Fricaworkshops on te Chnology / internet122 War 2.0 hoste D by the school For aDvance D international stuDies ( sais), Washin Gton D c, iFri), Paris Panelists: thoMas riD, calouste Gulbenkian fellow at the center for transatlantic relations in the school for advanced international studies at Johns h opkins u niversity, author of \"War 2.0\", usa Marc h ecker, researcher at the i nstitute Fran\u00e7ais des relations i nternationales, author of \"War 2.0\", usa sebastian kaeMPF, post-doctoral fellow and research officer, school of Political science and international studies, university of Queensland, australia The art of warfare has changed dramatically throughout the course of mankind. Historically, conventional armies have battled each other on geographical level play - ing fields. In recent years, however, an unconventional enemy has entered the virtual realm of the Internet as a means to conduct both modern warfare and gain public support. As a result, modern armies have been pres - sured to adapt to the rise of insurgencies and their use of modern technologies. The War 2.0 workshop not only provided a historical account of warfare but also exam - ined the contemporary and arguably fierce wars that are fought by states against insurgencies. Thomas Rid and Mark Hecker introduced their book on the subject of the rise of insurgencies and the Internet, \"War 2.0: Irregular Warfare in the Information Age\", which presented the two intimately connected trends that are putting immense pressure on modern and conventional armies to adapt. In addition, Sebastian Kaempf, the \"ghost author\" of War 2.0 was also present to contribute to the discussion. Rid, moderator of the workshop, began with a his - tory of insurgencies as a prerequisite to understanding the thesis and purpose of the book. He stated that in the 19th century, insurgents used telecommunications as a target to achieve their goals. In the 20th century, insur - gents used it as weapon to destroy and disorient their enemy. For instance, the release of graphic pictures by Somali insurgents caused the United States to rethink its military engagement in the early 1990s. In the 21st century, however, insurgents used telecommunications as a platform to gain popular support from an intended population, or \"human terrain\", as Rid explained it. Insurgent groups such as Al-Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Taliban now have to win the \"hearts and minds\" of the local population in order to gain support. Hecker provided the thesis and some functional definitions of War 2.0. War 2.0 argues that a major revolution in communication technologies occurred along with asymmetric warfare. 'Asymmetric warfare', or better understood as 'revolutionary warfare', can best be described as a conflict in which the resources of two competitors differ drastically in essence and in struggle. The intention is to interact and attempt to exploit each other's particular weaknesses. Hecker then asked: \"What happens when the two trends converge?\" He stated that a major move from \"enemy-centric\" to \"population- centric\" public relations campaigns has taken place since the dawn of the 21st century and explained that Western armies are highly trained and have a capacity for precise and high-tech weapons whereas insurgents are not only poorly trained and have low-tech weapons but are also outnumbered. Modern armies, however, are not easily able to eradicate insurgent groups due to the different playing fields. Modern armies are fitted for geographi - cal playing fields while insurgents depend on the virtual realm. Insurgents have come to comprehend that in Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009War 2.0 125 124 Worksho Ps on technolo Gy/internet order to reach a population, knowledge of information technology is essential. In order to become accustomed to this new kind of warfare, Western militaries have come to realize that defeating insurgent groups will not solve the problem. Winning over a distinct population will. Rid used the example of the Gulf War when the United States along with its allies could recognize the enemy whereas today the enemy is not readily identifi - able. These days, the enemy is clandestinely embedded within a general population, which makes any efforts among conventional militaries extremely tedious. On the one hand, Rid explained, the insurgency has the advantage in that it is able to move clandestinely without being distinguished. On the other hand, however, the insurgency is not as well equipped and prepared to carry out their hostile acts. Rid mentioned that the US gov - ernment is interested in creating a 'soft power' structure that could win the hearts and minds of a population; one that could essentially compete with insurgencies for the political support of a local population. Kaempf discussed the virtual war of images. Insur - gencies such as Al-Qaeda have used bloodletting images to capture their audience, while the US military has made the decision not to publish bloody images. It has taken a while for the US military to understand how uncongenial forces use images to woo their constituents. The former Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, used military news to legitimize the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through the release of biased images and videos, while he delegitimized the credibility of the adversary. Discussion The questions from the audience were all similar in tone. The idea that insurgencies are not easily identifiable and are using a different realm to conduct operations was thought by the audience as nothing unique. One par - ticipant had some reservations regarding the theories of Rid and Hecker. \u00b4He bluntly stated that the theory that insurgencies are using the Internet to conduct warfare is nothing new; politicians already knew about this long ago. He went on to say that nothing was mentioned that was theoretically and empirically substantial. He noted that within the book, the authors were waffling empiri -cally, that there was no sense of the careful analysis of themes, and that many of the statements seemed super - ficial. Rid defended War 2.0 by noting that as opposed to the wars of the past, information travels much more rapidly and is able to have a more profound effect today than just ten years ago. Other audience members agreed to the theories pre - sented in the book. One audience member concurred that large and modern militaries are slow to react to the virtual methods of insurgent groups. In conclusion, Rid, Hecker, and Kaempf discussed the future types of tech - nologies that could be used in war. One thing is for sure, the panelists agreed, that the impact of information will have a much more profound impact with the faster trans - fer of steady or motion imagery. | Edward CeskasuPPresse D Websites \u2014 W ill censors loose the race ? hoste D by c oMMittee to Protect Journalists ( cPJ) chair: Frank sM yth, journalist security coordinator, c ommittee to Protect Journalists, n ew y ork, usa Panelists: noah a teF, journalist and blogger and operator of tortureinegypt.net c airo, e gypt yaMan akDeniz, Director of c yber- rights & c yber- liberties, uk yanG henGJun, blogger and researcher on international politics for the c hinese government, c hina lisa h orner, h ead of r esearch and Policy, Global Partners & a ssociates, l ondon, uk This workshop focused on government attempts to control the Internet and bloggers' efforts to avoid such control. It was moderated by Frank Smyth who pointed out that CPJ was founded in the pre-Internet era. In fact, he added, they did not even use fax machines when they first started their work in 1981. Today, however, Internet journalists are particularly at risk of government perse - cution: Last year 45 percent of imprisoned journalists worked on the Internet. Especially in North Africa, the Middle East and Asia bloggers face strong restrictions. In his presentation, Yaman Akdeniz focused on Tur - key, which has introduced regulative legislation in 2007. Law No. 5651 was triggered by videos on the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, which were perceived as defamatory. The law provides wide block - ing powers to the administration and was intended to protect children from harmful content. In practice, however, the regulation led to much broader censorship. Anyone can report websites to the authorities and, until June 2009, 2,600 websites had been blocked by court or administrative blocking orders. Amongst the blocked websites is the popular video platform YouTube, as Turkish authorities could not agree with YouTube's leadership. While YouTube of-fered to block the videos in question locally, the Turkish officials asked the company to block the videos world - wide. Amongst other websites that have been blocked are geocities and British atheist Richard Dawkins' web - site. There have even been attempts to block the search engine Google, as it allowed people to access harmful content. Concluding, Akdeniz recommended abolition of Law No. 5651. Although it was intended to protect children, it has resulted in a broad blocking of content for adults as well. The law has no public support and its application is flawed. Furthermore, Akdeniz added, blocking and filtering are inadequate tools to combat illegal and harmful content and they entail collateral damage for 'innocent websites'. Finally, the blocking is ineffective, as it can be easily circumvented. Thus, the law effectively amounts to censorship. Noha Atef focused on how Arab governments are dealing with bloggers. When blogging started in 2005, people began to comment on restrictive policies and to criticize the government. While Arab governments initially were unsure how to respond, they gradually became more aware of the blogosphere's potential and tried to find ways to suppress it. Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009suPPresse D Websites -W ill censors the race? 127 126 Worksho Ps on technolo Gy/internet who steps out of line. Second, there is a very effective technological mechanism of censorship and control. He pointed out that the Chinese authorities have received a lot of high-tech assistance from the West in this area. Finally, and most importantly, fear plays a crucial role in controlling the Internet. There is a lot of self-censorship by bloggers or by the website managers, who will delete posts that they perceive as out of line. Lisa Horner on the one hand emphasized the impor - tance of understanding the complexity of the Internet's architecture. On the other she tried to identify ways to push censorship and government control back. Horner gave a brief overview of the four different layers at which authorities can interfere with Internet freedom. This starts at the lowest level, the physi - cal layer, consisting of the actual hardware, like PCs, switches, and the necessary wiring. The second level is the layer of connectivity and code, and includes web protocols, while the upper two layers are the application and content level. Horner pointed to two platforms which serve to define standards for all aspects of Internet communica - tion to restrict censorship on the Internet: The Internet Governance Forum, an intergovernmental initiative to agree on common standards for the internet, and the Global Network Initiative, which was launched both by Internet companies like Google or Yahoo!, as well as non-governmental organizations that work on freedom of expression. Despite some criticism, Horner considered these initiatives as \"a concrete step forward.\" An audience participant inquired about censorship in Western countries. Akdeniz stressed that in the Euro - pean Union, the countries with the lowest standards try to push them to EU level. While the United Kingdom strongly censors anything connected to child pornogra - phy, Germany and France restrict all content that denies the holocaust. Ataf was asked about her governmen's reaction to her website. She replied that she and her father have been threatened and harassed, but that her popularity protects her to some degree. Henjun agreed that some well-known bloggers are avoided by the police. Smyth concluded that there is still a long way to go, as currently 50 bloggers and 125 journalists are impris - oned. | Christof Koegler Atef described how she organized the ways in which Arab governments try to restrict bloggers. As bloggers use the Internet to spread a message, these are the three toeholds for censorship: First, governments have used different strategies to censor the message bloggers are trying to spread. Atef mentioned the Tunisian strategy to simply edit bloggers' posts. Another method is to attempt to discredit blog - gers and thus harm their message. In Saudi Arabia, the threshold of getting a blog blocked is extremely low. Atef pointed out that out of the three fields the online form provides - URL, the claimant's email address, and a reason why the website should be blocked - only the URL is mandatory. Second, the infrastructure of the Internet can be used to suppress blogging. This can either be achieved by making Internet access very slow or exceedingly expensive. On the other hand access to certain services can simply be blocked for all users. Finally, bloggers themselves are targets of censorship. Ataf mentioned a number of ways to re-label arrest or to arrest bloggers for other reasons in order to disguise the true motivation behind it. An even easier method is intimidation, for example through phone calls. Yang Henjun who is one of China's foremost bloggers, contributing to 12 different websites throughout the country, pointed to the fact that the date of 4 June, the anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre, is a very special day for the Chinese opposition, who generally refer to it as 35 May. Generally, he has a pessimistic outlook on civil liberties in China, as blogs and articles continue to disappear. Nonetheless, he said, he was very grateful for the possibility to protest on the Internet. In his perspective, in the 1990s the Chinese authori - ties realized that they cannot put up a wall around the country and stay completely isolated. They thus decided to open up the borders and parts of the economy. How - ever, they chose to keep close control of people's minds. As Henjun put it, authorities put up an \"invisible wall\" in the Internet. He sees it as the bloggers' ambition to tear that wall down. Henjun described three ways in which bloggers and Internet users in general are controlled in China: First, there is an active cyber-police, who might arrest anyone Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009suPPresse D Websites -W ill censors 129 128 Worksho Ps on technolo Gy/internetFroM Joysticks to bo Dy count : ethical as Pects o F MoDern WarFare hoste D by Deutsche Welle Panelists: hans-Joer G kreoWski, chair of the forum c omputer Professionals for Peace and s ocial r esponsibility, b remen, Germany noel s harkey, artificial intelligence and robotics expert, u niversity of s heffield, uk Juer Gen altMann, physicist and peace researcher, Germany Noel Sharkey opened with the statement: \"Killing has never been easier.\" He underlined this with examples of computer-based weaponry, such as the predator drone employed by the US army in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The pilot of such an Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) sits in his office in the United States, controlling the drone via satellite from his desk. Being far away from the action with no personal risk of being killed at all - this is what makes killing so easy, Sharkey said. Use of these new possibilities of modern warfare does not violate the laws of war. But in view of such new technologies, Sharkey demanded these rules to be revised. He explained that the United States plans to spend billions of dollars on developing future combat systems. But not only remote-controlled vehicles are of inter - est for the military. Sharkey reported that great efforts are being made by the US military in the research of autonomous weapons that do not need to be navigated by human soldiers, but move and decide independently. The military reasons for this new generation of weap - ons are obvious, Sharkey emphasized. They are much cheaper to manufacture, require fewer support personnel and perform better and decide faster than humans. First autonomous air vehicles have already been developed, and autonomous systems will also be used on ground battlefields in the future, he said. Looking at the current evolution of computer-based weapons systems, one can be sure that in the near future, autonomous robots will decide where to kill, whom to kill and when to kill them, Sharkey pointed out. Al - though robots might be the better soldiers from a mili - tary point of view, Sharkey stressed that they will feel neither empathy nor sympathy. Moreover, robots connot yet discriminate reliably between civilians and hostile combatants. Sharkey therefore called for a discrimina - tion test for autonomous robots - if it is not possible to completely ban this kind of weapon systems. Juergen Altmann began his presentation with a short overview of so-called Uninhabited Military Vehicles (UMVs), which are not necessarily armed but are used in war for surveillance and monitoring. He also men - tioned micro robots and animals with implanted control electrodes and cautioned that new military technologies always raise the question of how to control them. He pointed out that traditional arms control systems often came into force after a new weapons system had already been acquired. But there are also examples for preven - tive arms control, such as the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty or the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which intervene before weapons are acquired and are therefore more effective. Altmann presented a set of criteria that might be used in deciding whether a new technology should have preven - tive limits: \u00b7Adherence to and further development of effective arms control, disarmament, and international law; \u00b7maintain and improve stability; \u00b7protect humans, environment and society. If armed UMVs are assessed under these criteria it becomes very clear that preventive measures to control these systems should be undertaken, Altmann continued. The new technologies might have an impact on arms control and disarmament agreements, and unmanned vehicles might more easily be sent on a mission - which could lead to an earlier and easier escalation of a mili - tary situation. Furthermore, the new technologies have already initiated a new arms race and the danger of uncontrolled proliferation is present. Considering all this, Altmann said, it is very advisable to think about preventive limitations on armed UMVs. He admitted that a complete ban of all UMVs might not be realistic, but from his point of view, at least autonomous weapons and very small UMVs should be explicitly prohibited. \"Can the decision about life and death be left to machines?\" Hans-Joerg Kreowski asked. This question includes further problems, he said, and finally leads to another question: Will machines ever have a conscience and behave ethically? In that regard, Kreowski stressed that the decisions of a machine always depend on the program that is running on it and that decisions are just the results of computations. For that reason, so-called autonomous arms are also not really independent of humans, he stated. They can never do anything that was not programmed in advance by the programmers and one has to keep in mind that no program will ever be completely errorless. Kreowski then highlighted the aspect of computability. He stated that some problems are simply not computable - or are theoretically, but in practice nobody knows how. Other programs may need too much time or achieve unreliable results. Finally there are problems that are just too complex or too dif- ficult to be described precisely enough to be computed. On artificial conscience, Kreowski explained that ethi - Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009FroM Joysticks to bo Dy count: ethical as Pects o F MoDern W arFare 131 130 Worksho Ps on technolo Gy/internetcal behavior of machines might be incomputable or that the computation of an ethically influenced decision may need too much time. Even if it was theoretically com - putable, it would be impossible to agree on what is ethi - cally right or wrong. Kreowski therefore concluded that killer robots, unmanned vehicles or autonomous weap - ons will not be able to behave ethically. Artificial ethics is first of all artificial and the relation to human ethics stays vague, he said. He also warned that it is dangerous and irresponsible to develop and employ these kinds of weapons and their developers and users are \"potential murderers\". Discussion A member of the audience remarked that people would probably not pass the discrimination test either that Sharkey recommended for autonomous weapon systems. Sharkey replied that so far machines are not able to make any discrimination so that it would already be an im - provement if they at least discriminated like human sol - diers. Related to this, the question arose, before banning these new technologies, why not first compare them one by one with the traditional warfare with human soldiers. In response to that Altmann described the example of an unidentified group of people on a battlefield: Human soldiers would be able to check whether they are hostile combatants or innocent civilians. Unmanned air ve - hicles would only have the choice to shoot them or to let them go unidentified, which shows one of the numer - ous problems that arise with unmanned or autonomous systems. Kreowski added that the new technologies will only intensify the existing problems and not solve them. Another participant in the audience stated that modern technologies are already used in Afghanistan to help reduce collateral damage if compared to the war in Vietnam. Moreover, there will be no chance to achieve a complete ban of the described new weapons systems, so that it is better to find a way of controlling them. Sharkey stressed that he did not demand a complete ban of all kinds of robots but only for the autonomous ones. Altmann pointed out that the difference in the numbers of civilians killed in the wars today compared to Viet - nam is due to of precision weapons and has nothing to do with robots. The final question was related to non-lethal weapons and whether robots could be equipped with those. Alt - mann replied that even if a war started with non-lethal weapons, every side would switch to lethal weapons as soon as they fead losing lose the war. Militaries therefore would see non-lethal weapons only as a supplement and not as replacement for lethal ones. | Manuel Evertz FroM rePresentation to siMulation : serious GaMes anD neW a PProaches to crisis MeDia hoste D by s aarlan D university MoDerators: Julian k uecklich, Media Futures a ssociate ( ktP), ssociation, l zehle, transcultural media Germany Panelists: siMon Des ditor, agesspiegel o nline, b erlin, Germany Martin l orber, P r Director, e lectronic a rts Gmb h, cologne, Germany Soenke Zehle gave a brief overview of the structural layout of this workshop, which was to be broken into two segments. The first would consist of an introduction of panelists, followed by three major presentations by Julian Kuecklich, Mercedes Bunz and Simon Egenfeldt- Nilesen. The first segment would then be completed with a round of Q&A. Following a coffee break, the second segment promised to be a more interactive, hands-on experience provided by Serious Games Interactive. He then offered a basic introduction to the field of 'Serious Games and New Approaches to Crisis Media' and addressed how gaming might relate to the agenda of conflict prevention, conflict analysis, and conflict re - search. He stated that the concept should not merely be approached from a digital media viewpoint, but that one should also be aware of a much broader perspective, tak - ing the concepts relating to gameplay and cultural logic into consideration.As a side note, he briefly mentioned that the variety of URLs appearing in the presentations would be made available at the end of the workshop via the \"Darfur\" site, hosted by Amnesty International. Putting the workshop into the context of the Global Media Forum, he exclaimed that journalism and me - dia have come to a juncture where there is less faith in transparency and exposure, and where \"other ways of relating media to conflict analysis and resolution\" are being considered. Making the point that the main responsibilities of journalism at its new height should be to provide solid data and \"adequate representation\", he continued by introducing the main idea of the panel: a shift from the concept of representative media to an idea of simulation of what is actually \"going on in the world\".The role of the media should not be limited to simply relaying infor - mation, but also to invite a series of alternative paths of conflict development and conflict resolution. Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009FroM re Presentation to si Mulation: serious G aMes an D ne W aPProaches to crisis M eDia 133 132 Worksho Ps on technolo Gy/internetAs he continued, one of the reasons for bringing gaming into the context are the increasing levels of complexity in information, drama and visualization achieved nowa - days on the web - and the fact that especially younger users have grown more accustomed and are even used to a level of dramatization and visualization of data. This is fairly new and unique even to the world of journalism, and one way of calling it could be 'information aesthet - ics'. Zehle then addressed this new trend, one in which gam - ing would be one important advanced example. He ex - plained that some new tools were initially developed for a MMORPG (massive multiplayer online role-playing game) until the developers discovered that players/users were interested in sharing information, which resulted in the popular platform flickr. The typical actors responsible for platforms in Web 2.0 social media use also take part in crisis mapping and information visualization. Zehle mentioned the Univer - sity of Harvard as one of the key players in conducting research in this broad field. Information visualization is an extremely broad field and contains a variety of complex questions and specializa - tions. \"I Revolution\", a blog recently published by one of Harvard's doctoral students, states that \"where we are in terms of complex crisis-related information vi - sualization ... was started by people who defected from the world of global television\". One of these people was Rebecca McKinnon, former Bureau Chief for CNN in Beijing and Tokyo. She is co-initiator of \"Global Voices\", a community of more than 200 bloggers around the world who work together to bring translations and reports from blogs and citizen media everywhere, with emphasis on voices that are not ordinarily heard in in - ternational mainstream media. She questioned the future of crisis coverage on international television during the mid-1990s. She claimed the future of crisis media was online, and that projects like Global Voices provided an \"editing blogging aggregator\". Global Voices' most unique fea - ture is that it is available in several languages, prevent - ing it from being perceived as another North American initiative that would save the world. It is rooted in a variety of local media cultures in combination with a fairly stable editorial team which bypasses the problem of crowd sourcing. One of the most visible initiatives was how to address the future of crisis media. A critical point, which arose from this question, was that crisis media actors need to engage more directly with conflict analysis and conflict research. One solution was to find alternative narratives when addressing conflict media. Although traditional print media can be seen as remaining stagnant here, they do in fact use a variety of audio text and video archive, moving away from browser-based reading and com - mercial terms and towards environments that are a more game-like experience within these media sites. Zehle pointed to a variety of games surrounding the spectrum of crisis media. \"Darfur is Dying\", although a simple browser-based game, linked back to archive information on the conflict. And although Darfur has received massive media coverage, the idea of simulation becomes more prominent, as exposure alone will not suffice. Games such as \"Foot Force\" are used by several UN agencies to simply advertise what they do. The Commissioner of Refugees produced a game entitled \"Against All Odds\". A plethora of disaster-prevention games have also been designed by the British Red Cross. However, this is not an easy terrain as politics are inevi - tably involved. One particular game, \"World Without Oil\", used the online element to aggregate user-pro - duced and user-reflected text and videos on the question of how society may be able to deal with not having oil. It is clear that the producers of such media are not only limited to activists and do-gooders, as the political spec - trum which has reached and begun to use gaming plat - forms is extremely broad. Companies are also involved in advancing their agendas via this new communication channel. For example, Chevron's economist group have developed a game in which users must find an energy future for their local city. However, the biased nature of each individual company is ever-present - Chevron will undoubtedly be part of the future. Although gaming does not necessarily mean pro - gression or advancement in any sense of human nature, Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009FroM re Presentation to si Mulation: serious G aMes an D ne W aPProaches to crisis 135 134 Worksho Ps on technolo Gy/internetcreated by Serious Games, in which players are placed in a virtual environment and write articles, essentially play - ing a freelance journalist. In the game \"Palestine\", for example, players can choose whether to experience the game through the viewpoint of a Palestinian, Israeli or American national. Players' writing is, of course, based on these perspectives and the information they receive, and as the game progresses and they become more involved their neutrality and objectivity are brought into question. The aim is to steer players away from producing a digested, straightforward linear story full of facts, and towards reporting on their personal experi - ences within the conflict from an insider perspective. The basic gameplay tightly integrates winning the game and learning more about the topic players are set to learn about. The elements of this equation include gathering, analyzing, and addressing information. This is achieved via finding good informants, gaining their trust, getting their story, identifying when they say something which is newsworthy and relevant to the story and finally to compose the article. He then addressed the different layers of the gaming world which include not only the contents and informa - tion, but also the themes or different perspectives - from soldiers and NGOs to mothers losing their children, and martyrs. On a more basic level, the skills and methods are also addressed, what it means to write an article or take a quote. The most unique layer appears to be the mixed frustration of what actually occurs, the journalis - tic viewpoint of seeing and understanding two (or even more) sides of a situation, with no neat and tidy ending. During the second half of the workshop, partici - pants were able and encouraged to play the game \"Latin America\" (which was previously introduced by Egen - feldt-Nilesen) on personal laptops provided. Following this, they were allowed to give feedback, both negative and positive, and talk personally with the workshop pan - elists, asking questions on the development of the game. Egenfeldt-Nilesen explained that the gaming engine is \"Unity Treaty\", which was previously used as an engine developed for MAC computers, and allowed for cheap and affordable game construction. One particular question which arose from gamers' feedback was whether there were a series of alternative endings to the games \"Palestine\" and 'Latin America\". Where \"Palestine\" does, \"Latin America\" depends on the arguments of the players' characters in changing the story, for example, altering the reaction of the \"end foe\". Another and somewhat more poignant question from the audience was how the developers of Serious Games Interactive chose the themes and conflicts in which their games were set. Egenfeldt-Nilesen explained that their choice of games was based on a variety of conflicts, from conflict areas with a lot of high-focus attention such as \"Palestine\", to \"South America\" which deals with more 'forgotten conflicts'. He also pointed to 'controversy' as another important factor for choosing a conflict and stated that future episodes are planned to begin to focus on topics rather than areas. Examples ranged from child labor to child warriors. Egenfeldt-Nilesen also explained that this would allow funding from the Danish govern - ment. In addition, it would allow games to break out of the common episodic nature, and create more overlap - ping topics design with a smaller multi-perspectivity than the pioneer game \"Darfur is Dying\". It was gener - ally agreed that one of the great strengths of a game as media is to make different views more easily accessible. | Bjoern Klaus and Matt Baker it is a well-integrated element of comprehensive multi-platform media and outreach strategies. Zehle ended by stating that thinking about Serious Games is an old idea, however we are still only at the beginning of what games might do. This relation to the old concept of play and conflict resolution is only the beginning. Factors ranging from alternate viewpoints and variety of simulated outcomes are a prime example of the steps to be taken forward. The forum floor was then passed to Julian Kuecklich who addressed the question of visualization and how it could be transformed into a form of post-representative simulation. Kuecklich explained the preconceived idea that gam - ing is a solitary pursuit, mainly engaged by young males with little or no social skills. However, events such as LAN parties have proved to be quite the opposite. Simi - lar in social notoriety to sci-fi conventions, they provide the opportunity for hundreds and thousands of gamers to not only play, but also socialize and personally exchange viewpoints and ideas. Particular games such as \"Coun - terstrike\" when observed from a structural point of view actually coincide with the concept of teamwork, social networking and collaboration. However, as concluded by Dutch historian Johan Huizinga (author of \"Homo Ludens\" 1938) an antagonistic element must be present in gameplay. Although gaming has become an increas - ingly social arena (especially with the rise of multi-play - er gaming over the last five to six years) its potential as a medium of cultural expression of information and news distribution has not yet been tapped. An floor participant stated that in the right circum - stances gamers can be encouraged to examine their own values by seeing what they are willing to do within virtual space. One aspect of gaming is the ability to shed light on a situation from multiple viewpoints, which allows one to access a situation from different directions and relates to the question of morality in crisis preven - tion and crisis reporting. Another participant, expressed concern about games being used for sinister purposes such as instrumental tools for institutional goals - for example recruitment for the United States army. He stated that games can also disrupt and change fundamental attitudes and beliefs about the world, leading to potentially significant long- term social change. After showing \"Darfur is Dying\" to several students, Kuecklich discovered that although not all found the game to be interesting, they were now informed on the complexity and the severity of the situation, which indicated that traditional media are not necessarily able to reach \"text-savvy\" audiences. This can also be said of issues ranging from deportation in the game \"I.C.E.D.\" and whaling as a commercial enterprise in \"Harpoon\". Kuecklich then posed the question of what would happen if Pac-Man were combined with television news reporting, as it were. If gaming technology were to be used for news reporting - that is using game topics for the news - it could lead to an emergence of questions, such as the is - sue of virtual prostitution with regard to virtual worlds. And while games such as \"Play The News\" remain on a simplistic level - the game consists of a branching tree structure where players make decisions on what may or may not happen on any given geo-political situation - massive multi-player gaming arenas in simulation games such as \"Sim-City\" have been used to verify the hypoth - esis by epidemiologists of the spread of virtual viruses, coined as \"artificial artificial intelligence\", that is human intelligence that drives processes in virtual worlds. Mercedes Bunz commented that the entertainment fac - tor, which has always been relevant and coincides with the element of objective story telling, has become an increasing component in the news. Simon Egenfeldt-Nilesen addressed the range of areas that Serious Games covers, the largest being edu - cational training. The industries which use these games include the military, health care and corporate training. While game formats take time to be developed, the scope of variety is indeed kaleidoscopic. Egenfeldt- Nilesen ran through a list that ranged from working with child cancer patients, the consequences of Mayan children in Guatemala not receiving proper schooling, to training firefighters, killer snails and the current global financial crisis. Egenfeldt-Nilesen introduced the \"Global Crisis Series\" Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009FroM re Presentation to si Mulation: serious G aMes an D ne W aPProaches to crisis 137 136 Worksho Ps on technolo Gy/internetMobile tv insi Ghts an D reFlection on consuM er habits hoste by n okia s ieMens n etWorks Panelists: stePhan s kroDzki, ceo and founder, GM it Gmb h, berlin, Germany steFan s chnei Ders, head, Mobile tv , nokia s Stefan Schneiders and Stephan Skrodzki introduced today's global mobile TV market and elaborated on is - sues such as regulation, country distribution, and future trends. While Schneiders focused on consumer habits, Skrodzki put a particular emphasis on interactivity. Market growth expectations for mobile TV are tremen - dous. Forecasts presented by Schneiders predict more than 335 million broadcast mobile TV users by 2012. At the same time, handheld digital video broadcasting (DVB-H) will become the dominant standard from 2009 onwards, reaching 182 million users by 2012. DVB-H has already gone commercial in Austria, Fin - land, India, Italy, Malaysia, Switzerland, and the Neth - erlands. Worldwide, some 25 countries are expected to start commercial DVB-H mobile broadcast TV within 2009/2010, among them Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Nige - ria, Qatar, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates. A special feature of mobile TV, Schneiders empha - sized, is that it merges telecommunication and media networks. For regulatory issues, this means that in countries where telecom and media are regulated sepa - rately, two regulatory bodies have to grant licenses. This is the case for many of the European countries, including Germany and France. Interoperability is an important issue in mobile TV. Interoperability drives the mobile TV broadcast market as it enables working across countries, operators and mo - bile devices. According to Schneiders, Open Mobile Al - liance Broadcast (OMA BCAST) is the preferred service layer standard, DVD-H the preferred broadcast standard. Looking at several countries, one can see that pric - ing modes differ between them. While Italian company 3 Italy offers six mobile TV channels for free in addition to special TV channels in premium packages, Swisscom offers one mobile TV service for unicast and broadcast. KPN Netherlands, on the other hand, offers mobile TV broadcast via DVB-H as part of premium packages (bundling). Currently, there are different business models for mobile TV. In Austria, for instance, a cooperative busi - ness model is used where different mobile operators use the same DVB-H network provided by one broadcast operator. In Italy, 3 Italy offers basic mobile TV channels free of charge to stimulate usage and support upgrade premium packages (low entry barrier). The model of holistic mobile TV, on the other hand, is used by Swiss - com with one \"seamless\" mobile TV service combin - ing DVB-H and unicast technology. Bundling business models are used by 3 Austria and KPN Netherlands, and mobile TV channels with advertising insertion by 3 Italy. For Schneiders, holistic mobile TV, which ensures a seamless mobile TV experience, offers the best end- Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009Mobile tv insi Ghts an D re Flection on consu Mer habits 139 138 Worksho Ps on technolo Gy/internetuser experience. For the future, only open standards will ensure interoperability and will boost market growth. Additional revenues will be generated by premium TV channels, interactive applications and advertising. In fact, mobile broadcast interactivity is a future market for mobile TV. Today, there are already a number of standard services through which the TV \"gets personal\", Skrodzki explained. These services comprise the areas of e-commerce and advertising, voting, communication and community, gaming, and information. Skrodzki sees a market for interactivity as interactive services involve a fun factor and customers are attracted by new services. In fact, interactive TV is already a real - ity and already existed before mobile TV. In general, it is the content provider and not so much the network provider that generates interactive services. As an example, Skrodzki introduced interactive ra - dio. Due to live aggregators, content such as live voting or SMS chat, are automatically created. Thus, no edito - rial staff is needed to maintain a visual radio service. In the ensuing discussion the first question addressed the relevance of mobile TV for countries such as Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, and Ghana. Schneiders explained that mobile TV was already launched in these countries. On the other hand, it has not been launched in Ger - many yet, as there are problems with license granting. Moreover, considering the fact that there are approxi - mately one billion PCs, two billion TVs and three to four billion mobile phones in the world, the particular relevance of mobile TV in Africa becomes apparent. In many cases, the mobile phone is the only communica - tion device in African countries. Addressing the high number of mobile phones compared to TVs and PCs, a member of the audience remarked that these are very simple devices and might actually not be suitable for providing mobile TV. Sch - neiders remarked that the durability of mobile phones amounts to six months to one year, which means that in about two years there will be completely new devices. Another question concerned the fact that most of the mobile phones services are prepaid. How can prepaid phones be combined with the billing for mobile TV? Neither Schneiders nor Skrodzki sees a problem in that. They stressed that mobile TV in Asia also works with prepaid phones. In fact, there are no technical differ -ences between post- and prepaid phones; the two only differ in business model. Asked about the market growth of mobile TV in countries, which already launched the new service, Schneiders and Skrodzki could only give numbers for Italy as either no public figures are available (Austria) or service had just been launched (Malaysia and Africa). In the case of Hutchinson, ten percent of its eight mil - lion customers in Italy were using mobile TV after 18 months in service. Again, Skrodzki stressed that market growth depends more on pricing and bundling models than on technical issues. When asked to give an outlook on overall market trends, the two workshop hosts explained that a num - ber of countries will launch mobile TV in 2010 with TV channels that already exist there. Schneiders and Skrodzki expect that for the first two to three years up to 95 percent of the mobile TV channels will be copies of 'traditional' TV channels. In fact, there is now only one Italian TV channel which was exclusively created for mobile TV. As mobile TV is a very new market, no one can predict what mobile TV channels will look like in five years, Skrodzki emphasized. It is also hard to predict whether international broadcasters will launch new mobile TV channels. Concerning interactivity, more us - ers will be needed to successfully implement interactive services for mobile TV. Finally, Schneiders and Skrodzki stressed once again that open standards (OMA BCAST) are needed. The example of Italy, which moved away from conditional access, sets a good example that open standards will in fact prevail. | Katrin Dauenhauersecurity leaks in cross - borDer D ata F loWs hoste D by n ational association o F so FtWare D Data s ecurity c ouncil of i ndia, n ew Delhi, i ndia vinayak Go Dse, data security expert, nassco M, Data s ecurity c ouncil of i ndia, n ew Delhi, i ndia Josy v Geor Ge, head, security strategy and architecture, Wipro Group, i ndia The panel was opened by Kamlesh Bajaj who gave a presentation on \"Outsourcing is a risk, but manage - able\". The heading already indicated the controversial background to outsourcing processes. India is one of the biggest recipient countries of IT outsourcing and, as Bajaj stressed, outsourcing to offshore is continuing to grow. Reason enough to talk about the benefits and the ensuing risks of offshore outsourcing in the 21st century digital world. The major tactical and strategic advantages interna - tional companies see in these processes are cost reduc - tion, improved internal business focus and better control over IT systems and resources. Moreover, the develop - ment of technology-specific skills and expertise abroad meets the increased demand for external service provid - ers from international companies. According to Bajaj, the global outsourcing market continues to grow at a steady pace, with a forecast growth rate of 8.1 percent in 2008, especially in countries such as India. But there is always a certain risk in outsourcing data, Bajaj divided the risks into perennial and evolving threats. The security threats and challenges are changing rapidly; however, IT companies must be able to respond accurately. While the danger of hackers, transaction insecurity and financial fraud are evolving, malicious code, Trojan and viruses can be considered as perennial challenges. In addition, computer systems and servers are under attack of 'cyberterrorism'\u2014the convergence of terrorism and cyberspace. Nowadays it is easy to learn techniques, acquire tools and eventually cause massive economic damage with small investments and without need for physical contact with the injured. Bajaj warned that these terrorists conduct serious attacks against critical infrastructures. Thus, a new form of security is needed as computers emerge as a new weapon of terror - ists. This situation is aggravated by a lack of cyberspace legislation. Many countries even lack laws for prosecut - ing cyber criminals. Other countries have comprehen - sive legislation sets, as for instance the data protection legislation in Europe which constitutes a complex re - gime of EU directives, regulations, and in addition to that member state-specific legal acts. Despite these global challenges, Bajaj recommended to balance risk with benefits. In many companies data leakage is homemade as employees use the company computer for private pur - poses such as instant messaging, sending and receiving of private e-mails or simply sharing corporate data and information with others outside of the company. Hence securing information systems has to be tackled on both sides, the companies and the service providers. In addi - tion, a legal framework needs to be developed to tackle cyber crimes even across borders. The Data Security Council of India (DSCI) has set itself the ambitious goal to establish and enforce data protection best practices and standards. Bajaj underlined Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009security leaks in cross-bor Der D ata F loWs 141 140 Worksho Ps on technolo Gy/internetof external websites, prohibiting the copying of infor - mation at endpoints (transfer data to portable storage devices) or e-mail disclosure of confidential content. The security requirements at a delivery center, however, are more sophisticated and range from personal secu - rity, security monitoring and incident management to workstation security and physical security. In this regard Godse emphasized the particular importance of physical security imperatives. Finally, he explained the National Skills Registry (NSR) in India - a system that ensures personal security. Companies are enabled to recruit employees directly through the DSCI or track the background of applicants with the support of the NSR webpage. This framework aims to guarantee that no criminal element gets access to the IT sector in India. The presentation by Josy V George, \"Off-shoring of Data Security - Best Practices Implementation by an Indian Service Provider\", demonstrated specific exam - ples on how data leaks can happen and how to deal with them. He provided a perspective on IT functions typi - cally outsourced and their sensitive data access need and reported that most types of IT functions do not require sensitive data to perform. So how can we control the accesses where it is implicitly available? George asked. Subsequently, he gave a perspective on the IT environ - ment for offshore-based IT functions. Different environ - ments require specialized controls, George continued, and exemplified two different environments of data protection. For instance, in the production environ - ments data are accessed by customers, analysts, offshore vendors, etc. while in the development and testing envi - ronments data are accessed by employees and contractor developers and testers. Therefore specific controls and protection systems have to be applied accordingly. Furthermore, George referred to data leakage threat - scenarios which can be encountered in IT outsourcing - scenarios that need to be prevented, he stressed. There are several means for privileged users to copy and/or steal sensitive data from the company servers as already mentioned i.e. USB, e-mails, web and print. But where is the protection paramount in this regard? he critically asked. George argued the outsourcing controls need to be concentrated closer to the data, i.e. within the enter - prise periphery. Rather than at the vendor end. Addi -tionally, the offshore development center controls need to complement the enterprise controls in certain special cases and supplement in most others, he highlighted. There has to be an alignment of the outsourcing security strategy and the insider data theft prevention approach of the overall enterprise security strategy in order to suc - cessfully secure data flows. On the basis of case studies, George further illus - trated best practice examples. Finally, he concluded that many companies collect an extensive amount of data but are not yet aware of existing security risks in its storage and further processing. | Patrick Fallisthat they must have practices and compliances based on best practice examples. The council strives for data protection and not for profit. The DSCI approach to self- regulation combines industry best practices with legal and privacy regulations of several countries worldwide. Additionally, the Council enters technology and vendor interactions as well as fostering knowledge collaboration with security market researchers, data protection author - ities and academic collaborations. Bajaj summarized that the industry-based DCSI acts as a self-regulatory organi - zation to promote India as a secure destination for out - sourcing where privacy and protection of customer data are enshrined in best practices by the industry, according to the DCSI's mission. Vinayak Godse introduced his presentation on \"se - curing trans-border data flow\" with the risks and ben - efits of outsourcing. The recent trend indicates a variety of IT outsourcing worldwide, including help desk ser - vices, business transformation and security outsourcing, application testing services as well as network outsourc - ing, just to mention a few. But what data crosses the bor - der and where do the security concerns mentioned occur in this regard? Godse explained that people mostly send data for storage as well as updating and managing. Yet these data flows contain personally identifiable or finan - cial information, business strategy documents and board presentations, credit card numbers and its authorization information, databases and media files, besides others. The challenge of securing the data flow, from the cli - ent company to the offshore delivery center, is complex but manageable. The exchange of information between the two actors takes place not only in form of data flow but also by personal communication via telephone or e-mails. Godse demonstrated the challenge of securing data in an outsourcing environment on the basis of the respective data flows. He mentioned the risks that might occur at each stage of the flow. Moreover, he provided applicable solutions and management for each stage in order to minimize the threat of data theft and misuse. Consequently he clarified typical data leakage scenarios within company IT systems and provided a control selection which responds to these security requirements. On the client company side there are sometimes simple solutions for securing sensitive data, such as blocking Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009security leaks in cross-bor Der D ata F loWs 143 142 Worksho Ps on technolo Gy/internetinForMation technolo Gy: ProvokinG or PreventinG conFlict ? hoste D by Foru M coMPuter Pro Fessionals F or Peace an D social r esPonsibility (F iFF) chair: hans-Joer G kreoWski, chair, Forum c omputer Professionals for Peace and s ocial r esponsibility (F ifF), b remen, Germany tockholm, s weden Dietrich Meyer- ebrecht, professor emeritus at r a Germany Merye M Marzouki, multi-disciplinary researcher, cnrs France Johns h opkins u niversity, usa Hans-Joerg Kreowski introduced the role of the Forum Compute Professionals for Peace and Social Responsibil - ity (FIfF), which was established in 1984 and has around 600 members, mainly in Germany. FIfF mainly focuses on issues such as information society, human rights, sus - tainable development, data protection, security, ethics, warfare, gender, etc. It also organizes conferences, the next one with the topic of \"Responsibility 2.0\", and has issued numerous publications. Dietrich Meyer-Ebrecht opened with a warning about the ambivalent nature of IT. Multimedia, that is, technically spoken, information and communication technology (ICT), or in more popular terms, the Inter - net, mobile networks, and satellite communication and so on. Thanks to multimedia, anybody can distribute any type of information; people can communicate any - time between any places on the globe. Thus, as Ebrecht stressed, ICT will, among its endless applications, sup - port both conflict prevention activities and peacekeeping operations. Nevertheless, it seems that ICT has also its detriments. The Internet is practically a legal vacuum allowing people to do whatever they wish. Even though abuse is prosecuted, it is very limited. In other words, the Internet has a great potential for conflict provocation by supporting aggressive operations on the one hand and creating new types of conflict on the other. For example, ICT has paved the way to the globalization of terrorism. Thomas Rid spoke about one functional role of ICT abuse in distributing extreme ideologies and political violence. He noted that we find ourselves in a sort of transition phase in which a society is divided into 'digital natives' and 'digital emigrants'. The former relates to a new generation of people who grew up and socialized in a new media environment whereas the latter describes people like politicians. Even though they are responsible for enforcing the laws and protecting the system, they have much poorer understanding of ICT compared to the people they 'fight' against, namely criminals. He also gave a number of examples of possibilities to abuse the system. Israel is a very high-tech society, many people have access to facebook and upload a lot of informa - tion onto the system. There is a concern that some of the information might be used against them so a legal protection movement for such individuals was created. Moreover, extremists use the web for so many different, very often illegal and dangerous, purposes such as up - loading instructions on how to produce a bomb, to find each other, for 'fundraising', etc. Rid concluded that a risk of exploiting technological possibilities is 'out there', for both sides. Meryem Marzouki presented the issue of safety en - deavors and their incorporation into national legislation. She noted that laws and regulations, which are well-ac - cepted by a fear-driven society (or at least its silent part), are actually a legalized abuse of IT. As a result, it creates conflicts with civil rights and issues related to global Internet governance. First, information and communi - cation technology (ICT) is much more than a double- edged sword, as it can shape different behaviors. On top of this, technology is not neutral. Second, it is more than just logistic means of implementation; ICT is an integral part of public policy. Further to this, users interact with technology, and ICT, especially the Internet, is global in nature. Marzouki emphasized how important it is to un - derstand whether ICT in a security field can be a source of public order or rather new disorder. ICT controls people's movements (to know where they are going), circulation of information (information management, outsourcing), personal communication via e-mail or web searches (general law on data retention), and gathered data is later stored in a centralized system. It reveals information on people's intimacy, health, religion; generally speaking it maps people's activities. Therefore, Marzouki stresses that it is crucial to define appropriate security policies (e.g. technical standards) and structure within the emerging markets. The devel - oping trends present few new offenses that are created by the use of ICT. The state consolidates its own logic of policy control. For example, in France, authorities can directly access personal data without legal authorization. It is not enough to talk about a Big Brother state. Some experts try to explain the logic at play by point - ing to the fact that often certain legal provisions have been set up under dramatic circumstances, such as the legislation adopted after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. But that in turn has led to the erosion of a sense of privacy. Nowadays people are trading more and more of their Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009inForMation technolo Gy: Provokin 145 144 Worksho Ps on technolo Gy/internetprivacy and personal data against a benefit of certain free services like facebook, e-mail accounts, etc. And so control is becoming pointless and pacified. However, there are some consequences. For instance, the increase of surveillance and social control may lead people from a sense of trust to generalized suspicion. As a result, it can cause a breach of 'social contract' between the state and its citizens, as this contract is based on mutual trust and the preservation of everyone's freedoms. Cristopher Kullenberg talked about how civil re - sistance against undermining civil rights can benefit from ICT, namely because information distribution may strengthen public awareness, and effective networking can create oppositional power. As an example, he pre - sented a demonstration against Internet surveillance that was organized within 20 hours in Stockholm. Legisla - tion on Internet surveillance was passed so that the government agency National Defense Radio Establish - ment, FRA, was allowed to monitor Internet traffic. As this surveillance is strictly concentrated on data, it was perceived as a threat to personal integrity. Internet activism is presently a new phenomenon. Most of the 'activism' takes place via Internet mainly due to its speed and the fact that it allows people to stay connected for as long as they wish. Kullenberg asked whether it is a matter of abuse or rather security. The FRA has been criticized for wanting to deploy mass sur - veillance. Furthermore, as our lives have become more digital, huge amounts of data are being created; in some states secret police can take advantage of ICT to access information. In conclusion he pointed to the negative impact on civil society, as people can internalize a sense of fear by knowing that they are monitored and that fear can lead to a 'paranoid' society. Discussion The discussion centered on the abuse of new technolo - gies' and whether ICT promotes or prevents conflicts. Terrorists use the Internet to organize themselves but on the other hand security organizations can track down such virtual activities. For instance, a few years ago German authorities were tipped off by a security agency that had tracked an e-mail sent from an Internet cafe in Stuttgart to a village in Pakistan about the danger of possible attacks. That information enable them to pre -vent anything happening. The Internet is a 'territory' where people can do good and bad things on a much bigger scale, as communication is much faster and in - volves people around the globe. However, one cannot blame technology per se. | Karolina Grzyb byPassin G censorshi editor, r irtual l ibrary, r ussia Markus b ecke Dahl, entrepreneur and blogger, founder of netzpolitik.org, b erlin, Germany Th workshop centered on blogging and its potential to circumvent censorship. While it focused mainly on Rus - sia, the case of Germany was also presented for compari - son. Christian Mihr moderated. To illustrate the bad working conditions of journal - ists in some parts of the world, Mihr pointed to a recent case in southern Russia, where one was assaulted and killed. He posed the question whether there is space for independent media and if there is, whether they can in - fluence public opinion. Can blogging be a tool to bypass censorship in traditional media? Markus Beckedahl pointed out that he had met Gorny several months ago, that they were already well acquainted with each other's positions on blogging and censorship, and had noticed some parallels, but also differences. The Russian and German blogoshperes are comparable in size and both are independent linguistic 'islands' with little interaction between them. What sets them apart is the degree of freedom of the political system in which the communities operate. He briefly presented his blog netzpolitik.org, which was started six years ago and gravitates around digital rights issues on local, national, and international levels. The team plays with the possibilities of the Internet, us - ing twitter as a fast-paced communication tool, YouTube to publish videos without being pestered by cease-and- desist letters, as well as a podcast channel. Beckedahl then presented some examples of the blog's recent activities, which illustrate the specific conditions of the new media. To protest against the mo - nopolist position of Microsoft, activists from netzpolitik.org entered a lobbying event at the German parliament. They were dressed up as penguins, the mascot of the in - dependent operating system Linux, decorated the buffet with small flags featuring political slogans, and docu - mented the event through a live video stream and pic - tures. While the activists were removed from the build - ing within one hour, the footage of the event continued to spread and quickly spilled over to the mainstream me - dia, attracting considerable attention. Beckedahl pointed out that the group had used methods of Greenpeace activists but that they were independent from journalists, as they documented everything themselves. The second example concerned the recent spy scandal at Deutsche Bahn, the German railway. When netzpolitik.org critically reported on the case, Beckedahl Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 147 146 Worksho Ps on technolo Gy/internetThis journal, which has a circulation of 100,000 cop - ies, focuses on reviews of popular blogs and topics in the blogosphere. There are about 7.4 million Russian lan - guage blogs, where each day bloggers create around one million posts. Yandex, the biggest Russian search en - gine and blog provider, acts as a multiplier for the most popular blogs. As more direct forms of political protest are sup - pressed, activists resort to a wide range of creative and artistic means of protest. These include flash mobs, 'monstrations' - demonstrations with absurd slogans - and concordance marches, where protesters seem to fully agree with all government policies. Gorny pointed out, however, that these forms of protest are being increas - ingly suppressed as well. Blogs publish these events and the police brutality with which they are disrupted. Gorny emphasized the role of psychological support that blogs can play, as - in the absence of critical reporting in the mainstream me - dia - they give people the feeling that they are not alone in their political opposition. Summarizing, Gorny painted a hopeful picture of the Russian blogosphere. Referring to the lead questions Mihr had posed, Gorny pointed out that as long as blogs are taken seriously by the users, they will continue to be influential. He stated that the blogosphere can circum - vent censorship, impact political thinking in Russia, and has a significant and growing reach. Discussion Mihr asked the panelists whether journalists were blog - ging, too. Gorny replied that in Russia many journal - ists have a blog, many of which are popular. He also noted that often one can observe a \"schizophrenic split\" between the professional and the private writing of journalists. In particular he mentioned the prevalence of obscene language in blogs as a strategy of cultural resistance. Mihr then asked Beckedahl whether, in comparison to traditional media, their blog reached new audiences and was used as an alternative source of information. Beckedahl replied that, contrary to the Russian case, in Germany most bloggers write for fun rather than as political activists. However, particularly young people use blogs as an alternative source of information. This is unfortunately also true for right-wing extremists and radical anti-Islamists who are very active on the Inter - net. Gorny added that politics is usually boring but that in unusual situations people feel compelled to write about it. An audience member asked whether politicians used blogs, too, and whether they did so openly and success - fully. Beckedahl replied that only a few young and less well-known politicians do. German chancellor Angela Merkel started a weekly podcast, which, however, lacks a feedback function. Gorny added that in Russia many politicians, mostly from the opposition, have popular blogs. Even the president has a very active blog and actu - ally reads the users' comments. | Christof Koegler received a cease-and-desist letter from Deutsche Bahn's legal department. Unsure of how to react, he put the let - ter up on the blog and circulated the news through twit - ter. Again, the story spread quickly and eventually made the front page of the German daily 'tageszeitung'. Finally, Beckedahl touched on the ongoing Ger - man debate on restricting access to some Internet sites to battle child pornography. netzpolitik.org is critical of an approach restricting access to certain Internet sites and demands to shut down the servers that host such mate - rial, but not to interfere with the web's infrastructure. A petition was filed through the German parliament's on - line petitioning tool. Although most often they are not signed by more than a few hundred people, in this case the petition passed the critical mark of 50,000 signatures within three days and had reached 110,114 at the time of the conference. Once again, the story spilled over into the mainstream media. Summarizing, Beckedahl emphasized the new me - dia's potential to bring marginalized topics into the mainstream media. Eugene Gorny, whose PhD thesis is entitled \"A Creative History of the Russian Internet\", is involved in a host of projects that combine Russian culture and the web. In his presentation, he pointed out that some years ago he, along with most of the Russian blogosphere, was not interested in politics. In the recent past, however, rising injustice has driven more and more people to get involved in political commentary and activism. Gorny quoted Andrei Illarionov who defined the Russian political system as authoritarianism bordering a 'soft' dictatorship. Although this does not have a strong impact on the common citizen's daily life, political rights and civil liberties are strongly restricted. While the degree of freedom of the press had grown from Soviet times through a period of liberalization during Glas - nost until the 'era of the oligarchs' in the 1990s, Gorny criticized that this trend has reversed since Putin came to power in 1999. The mainstream media are under strict government control and any organized opposition is sup - pressed with brute force. In recent years, however, the blogosphere has emerged as an alternative media space. To illustrate its influence Gorny presented the audience with a copy of the journal 'F5', which he had picked up at the airport.

They are opening trailers to a popular video game about the nuclear Armageddon. He told a story of his own youth during the Cold War. Growing up in the 1960s, most children were very well aware of the dangers of nuclear war. Besides such government propaganda films as Duck and Cover, he was exposed to all sorts of other commer - cial movies and TV shows that warned of the horrors of the arms race, he said.He went on to identify 'play spaces' as places where chil - dren develop their identity. Play is the single most im - portant activity in a child's waking life. It is the process by which they begin to develop the mental skills and ac - quire social habits necessary for participating in society. Play spaces are meeting places where children interact. It's a critical space full of mixed realities. For the most part, play spaces are structured by gender differences. Traditionally, girl play spaces are defined as domestic and aligned to building their gender roles, and so are located in or close to the home, while boy play spaces are linked to wild or unclaimed spaces set much further from their home. Boys want to explore, conquer and to establish an independent identity. Mantello recalled that he liked to play in bushes. It was his imaginary universe. He fondly remembered that he and his frieds played a lot of games in the bush, but their favorite was 'war'. They would divide into two sides, stake out territories and rehearse war scenarios like the ones they saw at the cinema or on television. Grow - ing up in the sixties, Mantello saw many war images on TV (Vietnam, World War II). His favorite TV show was called Combat and ran from 1962 to 1967. It was TV's longest-running WWII drama. Nowadays, Combat is one of the most popular video games in Japan. It empha - sizes of conquest and war. Mantello said that the relationship between milita - rism, play and games predates video games. The themes of military conflict and battle have been a major part of games since the first board games were created. Games such as Go played first by the Chinese as Wei Chi , and later by Japanese 2,000 years ago, to early forms of chess 1,000 years ago played by Europeans, to contemporary games such as Risk, Stratego and Battleship all simulate the strategies and actions of military conquest. All utilize the boundaries of game space as the battlefield. \"Not surprisingly then, the video game, which is the most recent cultural emergent form is populated by a large majority of titles whose narratives and game play simulate war,\" Mantello said. Video games from the most recent to their beginning are a reflection of the social and political process of our day, and the result - ing fears and repressed anxieties expressed through our culture. Examples of that are popular games like Desert Storm (Second Gulf War) and Rambo (Reagan era). Space Wars was the first video game and it was cre - ated almost 60 years ago, Mantello said. It was developed as a response to Sputnik 1 and the Cold Wartensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. Space Wars was not planned. It was just a leisure ac - tivity of a computer scientist. \"But how did a leisure pas - time activity of scientists grow to become a billion dollar industry?\" Mantello asked. He had several answers: Video games are now a reflection of society. They offer the ability to control and manipulate an artificial world. They not only represent, they also allow us to participate and they capture the social consciousness of their time. Video games are the preeminent cultural form of main - stream media. Popular games of our time are Counter- Strike, Call of Duty, and the most popular is WarCraft. It accounts for nearly 50 percent of all online gamers with 12 million registered players. Militainment The history of computers and video games is linked to the involvement of the US army. The army first used computers to decipher German military codes at the beginning of World War II. After WWII, computers were used to track and stimulate real-time movements in real wars. Computers became embedded in army strate - gies because simulation came to serve as the artificial training aids for operation and combat. But simulators were expensive, uncomfortable and unpopular. And at the beginning of the 1980s, people in the army began to see the similarity and thus potential of integrating video games into simulation. Mantello explained that the trainers were costing them millions of dollars. Video games could possibly do the same job and were selling off the shelf in supermarkets for $49.95. In 1980, a game called Battlezone was produced. It was the first 3D animated game. Battlezone became very attractive to the US military, and they approached the video game industry. This was the first cooperation between the video game industry and the US army. Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009Pleasure, i Deolo Gy an D al Gorith M: the rise o F the M ilitary entertain Ment 151 150 Worksho Ps on technolo Gy/internetBattlezone is also the grandfather of all first person shooter games. It's a mixture between the modern and the primitive. Violence is used to solve problems, Man - tello said. In 1993, Doom, yet another very popular video game, was released. Doom is a science-fiction and a military story at the same time. Its 3 D techniques and its innovative lightning made it very successful. Players were able to download files and to modify the game. They could create new scenarios and new characters. Two enlisted marines replaced the aliens in the game and the landscapes with Middle Eastern landscapes and characters: Military Doom was born and also became very successful. Military Doom is a bridge between the gamer and military worlds. In 2000, video games were criticized, especially because of the Columbine massacre. At that point, the US army faced the lowest recruiting rate in their history and they decided to produce their own video game to attract young people. So in 2005, the game American Army came on to the market. It was a free download, accessible for everyone. It combined the idea of mixing the real world and fiction. With their real hero blog, where a real soldier got portrayed, they put faces to the fictional game. In 2007, the US army went one step further and ar - ranged simulations near large public events. People could meet real soldiers and physically experience military life, during those simulations. Visitors were able to choose between video games or missions in simulators, an ideal combination between reality and fantasy. During that time, the success of video games also reached an all-time high. And in 2008, the US military decided to install a constant camp in a mall in Philadelphia. They called it: Army Experience. Visitors can now not only play and experience military life physically, but can also see a real technical operation center and witness military opera - tions around the world. Discussion An audience member wanted to know more about the link between music and militainment. Mantello explained that militainment also uses music; country music, for instance, is often used as soundtrack for wars. He cautioned that simulations could lead to the loss of sensibility. Militainment also stands for the first person shooter games. The games and simulations will lead to war becoming something that is far away. And some - thing that is not physical anymore.\"Simulation is dan - gerous,\" he said. Another audience participant wanted to know whether the camp Army Experience also attracts older generations. Mantello replied that most visitors were teenagers and that theme parks are entertaining but also a powerful tool for indoctrination. | Nadina Schwarzbeck the youn G Generation : is anyone WatchinG, anyone listenin G? hoste D by Deutsche Welle chair: conny c zyMoch, Phoenix tv , Germany Panelists: susan Gli, c hief o perating o fficer, i nterMedia GuiDo bauMhauer, Director, s trategy, Marketing and Distribution, Deutsche Welle, Germany inGriD volkMer, u niversity of Melbourne, a ustralia brooke unGer, the economist Conny Czymoch introduced the session on the disinter - est of today's young generation - the so-called 'digital natives' - in the traditional media. She posed the central question of how to address this development. Are chang - es necessary and if so, what has to be changed? What does a traditional media provider like Deutsche Welle do to attract the young generation's attention? And what does a very traditional paper like the 'Economist' do to address youth? By formulating these questions, the mod - erator introduced the audience to the issue of the 'young media culture'. The first presentation was given by Susan Gigli, who analyzes how the new media approaches the young generation, which is defined in her research as persons between 15 and 24 years of age. She asked whether there is some kind of a \"global youth media culture\". Point - ing out that the young generation is increasingly wired, mobile and tech-savvy she was affirmative in that respect and explained that the youth is using the new media not only for entertainment but also for gathering informa - tion and news. But a so-called 'youth media culture' is not solely defined by access to the new media; she defined this culture through characteristics more unique to youth in general, such as: \u00b7An innate openness to innovation, newness and change. \u00b7An innate optimism, because young people are try - ing to use the media both as consumers and produc - ers to push for change and betterment. \u00b7A deeply social attitude, as youth use the media for sharing, interacting and connecting with others. \u00b7Empowered producers rather than passive consumers of the media. They actively take part in the creation process by themselves for themselves. \u00b7Empowered consumers as they have a greater variety of information available which enables them to ques - tion information presented to them and to be more critical towards that information. She argued that even if there is a 'global youth media culture' which is still growing, it is far from being a Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009the youn G Generation. is anyone W atchin G, anyone listenin G? 153 152 Worksho Ps on technolo Gy/internetheading and whether we are becoming global citizens or becoming local cosmopolitans. She critically questioned if all the information we are gathering is changing our minds and inspires us to start dialogues with other cultures. Her answer was, \"No,\" and she continued that especially the young generation is changing to its dis - advantage, due to new technologies and new media. As a scientific study demonstrated, the young generation around the world is more interested in globalization than in what is going on in their own countries. In her opin - ion, this shows a new kind of distance produced through the media. She ended by stressing that it is important not only to think about technology in regard to the young generation, but also to really understand what types of images are being conveyed by the new media and what consequences this brings with it. Brooke Unger stated that at 'The Economist' jour - nalists do not adopt every single trend; still the weekly is very successful. Even though they are a traditional print medium, its circulation has doubled in the past ten years. Despite the global economic crisis 'The Economist' had a record year in 2008 in terms of profit. He addressed the question whether a traditional publication like 'The Economist' can survive in a multimedia world in the future, and immediately affirmed the question, assert - ing that their 'facebook fanclub' consists of 134,000 members, which he considers to be an approval for that particular medium. Also, a special 'Economist fanclub' of 16,000 members, founded by a 16 year-old Cana - dian girl, shows that even the young generation is using and is interested in a traditional medium such as 'The Economist'. He argued that the 'traditional dryness' of the print media is attractive, even for the youth. Young people and students often associate 'The Economist' with smartness and an educated readership. This kind of assumption drives its success. In conclusion, he under - lined that also the print media needs to adapt some of the new technologies, but he personally hopes \"as a di - nosaur myself, that the dinosaur product keeps driving\". Discussion The discussion opened with the challenging question of how the young generation in developing countries can be reached with news and information as in some countries there is insufficient download capacity. Re -sponding, Baumhauer stressed the importance of dif- ferent distributing channels and explained that for each target group, a different way of transporting and differ - ent information might be worthwhile. The more ways of transporting news and information are available, the more people can be reached. For some countries, an em - phasized distribution through radio broadcasting might be better than through other channels. The participants agreed on of why youth are deeply into the new media. The possibility of being active was mentioned as the main driver. Internet users have vari - ous options; they can choose between information and entertainment, between watching TV or being interac - tive. This variety makes the new media very attractive, especially for the young. The issue of what is being done by the traditional media to address youth was brought up by another participant. In that context Volkmer re - minded all of the function of traditional media in agenda setting. The session showed that even if the new media is very attractive for youth, traditional media still plays an important role. The world needs both, the endless possi - bilities in the web to communicate and to be interactive, but also traditional media such as radio or newspapers, because of their quality and their agenda-setting func - tion. | Claudia Tesfaiuniversal one. The reasons for that are significant dif-ferences which remain not only across countries, but also within countries in terms of socio-economic scale, literacy, gender, ethnicity, urban-rural divides, and ac - cess to content. Guido Baumhauer started his presentation by ques - tioning the assumption that the term \"the young gen - eration\" implies that everything has to be 'funky and colorful' to attract youth. In his opinion, the key to being successful in addressing people, independent of their age, lies in \"good story telling\". He continued by comparing the past, in which a limited number of linear distribution channels had existed, with the present, in which everything - even content - is multidimensional and non-linear. He questioned if \"anything, anytime, anywhere\" really improves our lives and pointed out that consumers are even over-burdened by the multitude of information, content, platforms, distributing channel, and offerings. This leads to the development that today for any \"content producer it's not only about sending a message, it's about sharing messages, receiving messages and forwarding them\". Since the access of information is so varied, content needs to be designed distinctly for different platforms. He made the point, that 'the mouse with the long tail' is the right answer in times of mul - tidimensional media, which means that even if every single distribution channel has got just a few users, in total a great number of persons can be reached. That is why it is of great importance to distribute contents through as many channels as possible to reach as many people as possible. He concluded: \"Content is king, but efficient delivery is King Kong.\" Ingrid Volkmer raised the issue of social science. She explained that the social science approach is also impor - tant to understand what new technologies are there for. She said that these technologies are helping us to con - struct and understand the world, but at the same time they are responsible for the pictures we all have in our minds when it comes to certain conflict zones, for in - stance. She explained that a certain 'content shape' is not only the result of technologies but also of the media in global communication. She emphasized by arguing that even if new technology and new media are accompanied by lots of positive effects, they should not be blind to the fact that it is still not clear where this development is Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009the youn G Generation. is anyone W atchin G, anyone listenin G? 155 154 Worksho Ps on technolo Gy/internetcivil society 2.0 - ho W DiGital MeDia chan Ge Politics in turkey hoste D by r obert bianet, b c orporation (WD r), Germany keriM arPaD, Director, Forum s tuttgart (D tF), Germany Sybille Thelen opened the session with an overview of online access in Turkey. For a population of 70 million, where roughly twenty percent have never heard of the Internet, there are roughly 2.6 million computers. Most of them are in offices and in the cities, but the preva - lence of Internet cafes means it is difficult to ascertain whether the number of computers is an accurate reflec - tion of use. Set against this modern phenomenon is a chang - ing political background. To what extent, she asked the panel, is new media resolving traditional borders and establishing new discourse? Ertugrul Kurkeu stated that Turkey is not an ex - ception in being changed by new technology. What is exceptional, he believed, is the rapidity of its uptake. In the space of ten years, almost all journalists gained Internet literacy, whose spread is linked to the political stage. There has been an impression of a lack of borders, such that some have seen it as the real locus of debate. Yet such things as the ban on YouTube have shown that there are still restrictions on freedom of expres - sion. Judges can ban any site, which means in effect that the new media is still dominated by regulation. Kurkeu found it amusing to note, however, that even the Prime Minister, having mentioned watching something on YouTube, explained there are easy ways to beat the ban. Kurkeu mentioned several examples of new media proliferation. It has been used as an alternative way of seeking justice, for example a campaign to find the murderers of a schoolgirl gathered a large following and remained in the spotlight because of its online presence. In a country where many of the newspaper front pages are devoted to scandal, observed Kurkeu, illicit websites were appearing more and more in the stories. There is also a sense that the Internet provides a forum with few barriers so that rallies, protests, slandering, making friends, finding love, and fighting have flourished on the Internet. Murad Bayraktar echoed the point that Turkey was being changed by the Internet as much as any other country. Yet it appears to have made a large difference to the Turkish-German Internet community. The fact that Turkey is given a voice on the Internet has meant that media content which was formerly top-down, is now generated largely in the reverse. It was the dynamic by which minorities get a louder voice on the Internet, Bayraktar mentioned, that also gives rise to extremism. Examples cited included forums for extremist groups, and the Turkish military which announced a possible coup through the Internet. One of the main differences between German and Turkish Internet use, Bayraktar noted, was a tendency for the former to be more private and the latter more communal. Online communities tend to grow more rapidly in Turkey and there are a greater number of on - line political groups. In fact, one of the reasons YouTube was banned was its capacity as a forum to engage a huge amount of political commentary. Kerim Arpad suggested that the Internet has the potential to promote unity among people and it was for this reason that local governments and lobby groups were beginning to use it more for campaigns. He reiter - ated Bayraktar's point that there was a huge amount of opinions expressed on political platforms, online orga - nizations and facebook communities, which promoted a variety of ideas and activities. Thelen asked the panel to comment on which sec - tions of the population they thought were most active and how government was reacting to the changes. Kurkeu suggested that working people were the most prevalent users due to the easy access at the workplace, and peak hours of online traffic reflect the working day. The suggested age range was under forty but the sites accessed were too varied to separate into different groups. A significant point for the Turkish community living abroad was the ability to make cheap calls. In ad - dition, NGOs were able to expand their operations due to the increased ability to gather attention for campaigns through a cheap medium. In terms of the government, there were generally two responses, the first was to ignore the online debates and the second, though significantly rarer, was to em - brace and use it as an opportunity for discussion. There was some cooperation but the main engagement and empathy came from other organizations. Bayraktar mentioned that the Kurdish channel owes its existence to the presence and consumption of Kurd - ish music and culture that grew online. While it helped spread the language and culture it also leads to increased Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009civil society 2.0 - ho W DiGital M eDia chan Ge Politics in turkey 157 156 Worksho Ps on technolo Gy/internetradicalization. Arpad commented that there was a dis - junction between online political discussion where the youth were seen to have a voice and the political reality whereby that discussion was usually ignored. Thelen asked how much control the government re - ally had over the new media. Kurkeu responded that restrictions similar to those on the press only started in the last five years. However the opportunity to circumvent them is greater, especially when the domain is outside of Turkey. Discussion An audience member asked whether wsa tension be - tween the military and any religious influences. Kurkeu responded first by outlining two main discussions that were to be found online. 1. The ongoing campaign for Palestine. 2. Discussions over headscarves, where there was a dominance of men on the Islamic sites. Bayraktar argued that although women took a backseat in this discussion, there was still a strong Islamic wom - en's presence on the Internet, such as a popular cooking website presented by a woman in a niqab, and that the ability to hide authorship on the Internet needed to be taken into account. Arpad added that there were many Islamic imam advice websites but that there was a range of both liberal and conservative - furthermore many of these served as a dating platform. Another participant asked about the influence of blogging in Turkey. Kurkeu replied that there was sig - nificantly less blogging and that it was not considered a major source of opinion or information in the same way it was in Germany, despite the fact that some newspa - pers are promoting some bloggers. Bayraktar suggested that on the contrary, there were many people blogging, but there was little quality blogging, and bloggers did not garner a following in the same way German blog - gers might. However, there was a high degree of mobile blogging and there were many things like blogs but rather on the community level such as campaign blogs. As such blogs were present but on different sorts of plat - forms and of a different nature to the kinds of journalis - tic blogs found in Germany.The workshop finished with a listing by the panel of their favorite websites, which included the political orange tree, Surdyke, the site of the PM press office and dtf-stuttgart. | Maayan Ashkenazi brian stor M\u2014\"stories you Don't ForGet\". Multi MeDia storytellin G Meets crisis Prevention hoste D by Me Dia storM Presenter brian s torM, President, Media storm, n ew y ork, usa Brian Storm presented a photograph of a US marine, which was widely published in November 2004 and generated much public interest. The subject of the im - age, James Blake Miller, became famous and was widely referred to as the 'Marlboro man'. Miller today suffers from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of his experiences in the war in Iraq. Storm showed a film 'The Marlboro Marine' produced by his company MediaStorm.org, which blended still photographs of Miller's life in the United States with audio from an in - terview in which he discussed his experiences of PTSD. This was followed by a showing of 'Intended Con - sequences', a film about Tutsi women raped during the Rwandan genocide, which used interviews with sur - vivors to highlight their plight alongside that of their children. Storm spoke of the difficulties film makers have tradi - tionally experienced in finding distributors for such proj - ects - commissioning editors are often skeptical of public interest in such material - and of his personal belief that journalism should provide a call to action. He described the New York opening of 'Intended Consequences', an event at which the usual 'schmoozing' was largely absent owing to the power of the material on show.He then provided an outline of the activities of his company MediaStorm.org explaining that its operations go under four broad headings: First, MediaStorm is a multi-platform publication that aims to exploit the 'surge of connectivity'. Me - diaStorm themselves do no marketing yet people in 100 countries have visited their site and viewed their films. Storm explained that a main reason for this is the spread of interest through social networking sites which his company facilitates in various ways. They produce trailers that are uploaded to YouTube and can be easily embedded in facebook pages or blogs and ensure gener - ally that it is as easy as possible for bloggers to harvest information from their site. They also aim to make their content available on as many platforms as possible: they produce a Mac widget, provide access to their material on iTunes and have recently made their films available for the iPhone. Second, MediaStorm is a multimedia agency. Con - tent is licensed for use on major websites. Their film 'Never Coming Home' was featured on the homepage of MSN.com and was viewed by one million people in a day.

The ability to license to big companies has significantly increased interest in MediaStorm's content. Third, MediaStorm operates as a production and consulting company and has produced content for a number of partners. Medecins Sans Frontieres have recently contacted them for help in publicizing the situ - ation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The company has also worked with Reuters to produce an online archive chronicling the agency's coverage of the war in Iraq. Fourth, MediaStorm is committed to training: the organization runs workshops on how to tell a narrative story using new forms of media. They accept submis - sions and their website provides tutorials on how to use relevant software such as 'final cut pro'. Discussion An audience member commented on the importance of maintaining a balance between the need to tell a story and the possibility of objectifying the individu - als involved. Storm agreed that this was an important consideration and emphasized his belief that it was not the story-telling side of journalism that should change, but that there is currently a revolution in the means of story-telling. New media tools and distribution possibili - ties have made it accessible and affordable for increasing numbers of stories to be told. He referred back to the example of James Blake Miller, highlighting the fact MediaStorm's film had given Miller the platform to tell his own story and provide access to the experience of a real individual soldier, an experience somewhat at odds with that represented in the single photograph that made him famous. Storm was asked about the start-up costs of an enter - prise such as MediaStorm. He responded that they were really quite low, as the necessary equipment is cheaper to obtain than ever and thanks to the versatility of new technology few personnel were required to establish the company - at first there were just two employees. Medi - aStorm has also been able to expand whilst remaining a private company and has avoided taking money from big media organizations so as to maintain its independence. Storm stated his strong belief that the tools are now available for those working in the field to 'take journal -ism back' and that by focusing on old fashioned story- telling large numbers of new smaller companies will be able to develop. Another audience member who is involved in the establishment of a new journalism institute asked Storm how he would approach the task. Storm replied that he would prefer to call it a 'story-telling' institute as 'jour - nalism' has become too loaded and restrictive a term. He commented that he would encourage students to explore all available means of telling stories and that old conven - tions, such as that against use of music in reports should be questioned. Storm was then asked whether he felt there was a need for a new breed of journalist. He replied that actu - ally what was needed was a return to old values and that journalists should be freed from an increasing tendency to demand they fulfill multiple roles. He argued that the future of journalism is in the specialization and collabo - ration of individuals - groups of journalists and content producers working together on a smaller scale than at present. Several questioners then focused on the moral as - pect of Storm's work. They questioned Storm on why he seemed to be producing content specifically for the Western market and on whether it was correct to work with organizations such as Starbucks. Storm responded that MediaStorm is actually a very small company, cur - rently a team of just six, so their capabilities are limited. The company cannot deal with every story and this is why they provide instruction both online and through regular workshops to enable people to produce their own content. He argued that working with corporate partners can expand the reach of MediaStorm's content and can also serve to inform those organizations. He gave the specific example of how MediaStorm's involve - ment with Starbucks prompted the company's CEO to write personally to the President of Rwanda and recom - mend he watch 'Intended Consequences'. | Sam Cronin Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009brian stor M - D on\u00b4t F orGet\".

This represents a 3,712 percent increase from twitter's April 2008 numbers. Weber said that other social networking sites are increasing, too, but not as dramatically in most cases. Why had twitter become so successful? Weber sug - gested two main reasons: 1. In countries around the world, people follow the sources most relevant to them and access infor - mation via twitter as it happens - from breaking world news to updates from friends. It reaches mil - lions of users instantly. 2. Many famous people like US President Obama, twitter. And VIPs attract other people. Weber stressed that twitter has become a main player of the third stage of the real time web. He said that one gets content while it happens, which is a major step. Twitter is much quicker than most media and reflects the real time media era. But what is twitter exactly? It is a way to send text messages via mobile texting, instant message, or the web. The use of twitter is free but every tweet (message sent by twitter) is limited to 140 characters. Weber showed a photograph of a doctor who twittered during his surgery and a photograph of the plane which had crashed into the Hudson Bay River, underlining that pictures are an important part of twittering. One prominent example of how powerful twitter has become is the behavior of the government of China which shut down twitter before the 20th anniversary of the massacre on Tiananmen Square. When dealing with twitter, it is favorable if users know the following terms: Tweets = messages (max. 140 characters)Re-twitting = spreading messages from someone elseTwitter profile= a twitter ID Followers = visitors of twitter profiles Search.twitter.com = search engine (it has become very popular) Weber explained how people who use twitter can create an audience and how they can get followers. They go to the twitter page and type in a message. People who are interested in the message (for example a message about a certain conference) search for that via keywords. And once people have read the message, they can also file the profile of the person who wrote the message. Weber himself has 7,899 people who are following his profile.

Her tweet said: \"Atten - tion: In the Winnenden high school today there was a gun rampage, the perpetrator is supposedly still on the run - best not to come into the city!!!!\". Weber finished with a piece of advice to his audi - ence: \"Be careful when you use twitter to write private messages because tweets are being saved for quite a while and you can easily find them via Google.\" | Nadina SchwarzbeckWeber explained that one has to make a choice about whom to follow. This is why he uses a filter. (One can filter through the function search. twitter., then go to that page and type in a special keyword.) Another member of the audience was interested in the differences between twitter and other social net - works such as facebook. Weber replied that twitter is more focused and more specific than other social networks. And due to the lim - ited amount of characters, twitter is simpler. Communi - cation via twitter is more like a constant stream, nobody expects an answer. It's a flow, a dialogue. 5,222 tweets are being produced every minute. twitter has invented a new form of communication because it's between syn - chronous communication and asynchronous communi - cation, Weber said. A member in the audience then gave an example of how people use twitter. He talked about the demon - stration of a right-wing organization that took place in Cologne a few weeks ago. Communicating by twitter, people organized a counter-demonstration. Everyone interested could immediately know the plans and so was able to inform others in a very short period of time. Weber picked up the example to explain that one single message, sent by twitter, can reach for example 800 followers. Everyone who received the message can re-tweet it by passing it on to other people. And people who are new can use the function search.twitter.com to find other people on twitter. twitter users can be found by their names or by a special keyword. twitter can also be used to promote events or as a tool to give live re - ports during a conference. Another audience member wanted to know how the right people can follow or find him. Weber answered that before setting down a twitter profile people should define what they want. And when creating a twitter ID, people, especially journalists, should use their full name or a keyword, so that they can easily be found. Weber also explained the twitter term \"Follow Friday\" which means that a twitter user can recommend other users and also get recommended; this takes place on Fridays. There is also a twitter catalogue called wefollow.com where every user can write down their profile. Weber pointed out that twitter is endangering face - book because it's five times as fast as facebook. An audience member was curious to know whether twitter and facebook can co-exist. Weber answered that twitter is not a social network like facebook. It is a way of communicating. Social networking is a side effect of it. twitter is open to everyone and facebook is closed. Everyone can access twitter from everywhere and people can use it without having a profile. Another audience participant wanted to know how journalists can use twitter. Weber cited the Air France catastrophe as an example of how journalists can use twitter. With twitter one can quickly find out what people in France are saying about the catastrophe. twit - ter is a good source of information and journalists can do research in real time, he said. Weber advised all listeners to grow their influence as journalists by using twitter. tweets get re-tweeted and they are being spread very quickly. He recommended the best way for a journalist is to have a blog and to use twitter. twitter is a traffic driver. The function 'Tweeter feed' drives traffic to the blog posting. A member of the audience gave an example of how twitter saved a man from Egyptian justice: James Karl Buck was arrested on 10 April without any charges in Egypt for photographing a demonstration. He used his mobile phone to twitter the message \"Arrested \" to his 48 followers who contacted UC Berkeley, the US em - bassy and a number of press organizations on his behalf. The next day Buck twittered : \"Alive and ok. Still in jail,\" but was released not too long afterwards. Weber commented on the example by stressing that twitter is faster than broadcasting stations, and that it is possible to twitter via SMS. No Internet is needed. At the end of his presentation, Weber gave an ex - ample of the impact of twitter. In March 2009 a high school killer murdered 15 people, then killed himself, in Winnenden, near Stuttgart in south west Germany.

Innovation journalism, journalism that cov - ers innovation, has a role in this question. According to Nordfors, innovation journalism communicates to the audience new, innovative ways of solving problems, both creating new value and providing insight into how well society is organized. Sticking to the newsroom's traditional beat of vertical stories that separate topics and bring fragmented output to the audience, however, does not produce innovation. Instead, he calls on innovations in journalism and journalism about innovation to bring added value to society. In the traditional business model, journalism is about controlling the medium and content of informa - tion to attract and access the audience, whose attention is sold by selling access to advertisers. This model has not changed for over 100 years, and yet many still ques - tion why journalism is in crisis. The Internet has chal - lenged the classification and use of physical media, such as newspapers, to present analysis and TV for breaking news and emotions. The medium and content are in the process of separating from each other, making these old classifications less effective. Journalism by its relation to the audience - the new model. To produce innovative journalism, journalists must no longer be defined in relation to the medium, but by their relation to the audience. Nordfors defined jour -nalism. As the production of news stories and bringing public attention to issues of public interest. Journalism gets its mandate from its audience, and is required to act in the interest of its audience. To achieve this, a business model for the principles of journalism must be defined. An innovation system is needed that will provide new issues to the public and connect an innovative industry that supplies continuously new business models, prod - ucts, and innovations. For this, Nordfors argued, the vertically integrated traditional newsroom is probably not the right model. According to Nordfors, journalism needs to cover the topic of innovation, since a paradigm shift has oc - curred in the last 25 years. There is no more economic growth in creating more of the same thing. Something totally new has to be created. As innovation is part of core business, journalism needs to serve as communica - tion that stimulates innovation. While innovation is the major driver of economic growth and a keyword in the economy, it is not a keyword for journalism, and this needs to change. Covering innovation in journalism is not about technology, business, or politics as segments, but about the interaction of all of them. Journalism that does this can let its audience see the bigger picture and put innovation into the public debate in order to discuss our future, which deeply depends on innovation. As an innovation system is the competition between constructive innovation Journalis M Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009constructive innovation Journalis M 169 Ps M eDia tranin G, Develo PMent an D ProDuctionTypical models of news journalism 1. Go after the crooks; 2. Find the victim; 3. Conflict; 4. Drama; 5. Tell stories in a way that's not boring. By sticking to their model, journalists are missing out on stories that can bring new solutions that inspire people to do something different. He claimed that journalists need to add new news criteria and provide a frame setting for solutions. For example, why not do a story on an area with zero percent female unemployment rate, about a fantastic teacher, or about people who have benefited from the financial crisis? Danish Radio even did a story where they locked up local politicians for 24 hours to find solutions for bringing tourists to Nordjyl - land. Thus, instead of asking politicians about the prob - lems, we need to ask them for solutions. Models for constructive journalism1. Stop talking; 2. Listen for meaning; 3. Be present. Journalists must combine reporting on the prob - lem with reporting on the solution. By doing so they can present new ideas and enable society to participate and discuss solutions. Transferring this to the broader society, however, involves finding the right business model, which means changing the old newsroom model and thinking outside the box, the depressing story, and old models of journalism. By doing so, they can move more towards collective intelligence instead of collective neurosis. Discussion A member of the audience asked how people who are not willing to pay for negative news, will pay for posi - tive news. Haagerup remarked that according to eco - nomic principles, people do not want to pay for things of which there is plenty. Since people will not pay for information they do not find meaningful, journalists should give people something they do not know they would end up loving. Instead of bringing more technol - ogy and products they should offer more meaning, such as when the local media forces politicians to find ideas for solving problems. One participant asked whether it was too late for the newspaper and its use of innovative journalism. Haagerup replied that the newspaper as a mass medium is dead, and that at the cost of approx. $800 per year, it will instead become a niche media for elites. Nordfors added that the identity of journalism must be moved away from its identity to the medium. Journalism is thus not linked to the paper, but to its audience. One participant challenged the panel for not consid - ering how journalism has a different impact on different consumers, depending on the side of the journalist. If we are not making the news but taking it from the people, he stated, how can we expect to be objective? Nordfors remarked that one cannot report and empower the audi - ence without influencing them. Instead, journalists need to strike a fair balance, deciding how to deal with their involvement and to find the right business model that gives people incentive to enhance the model of journal - ism. Reporting on both sides of the fence is profession - alism and if one is able to do that, people will pay for it. With so many sources of information in the media, people must know that they can trust their source. Jour - nalists possessing such trust will have a future. Another participant challenged the panel, stating that while in - novative journalism may be the dream of every young journalist, the boardroom does not accept the model. Nordfors responded that the newsroom needs to create incentives for university researchers, companies, start ups, etc. to look for new ways to influence journalism. That may involve switching dollars on paper to cents on the Internet, as Google did. We have to make a quick shift away from expensive infrastructure in the news - room or it will break up (unless publicly funded). As the stakeholders want to push their language into society, it is vital to build a business model that represents the audience. A video conference call was conducted with Fatima Akhtar, a representative of SAAMA TV, an innovative journalism station in Pakistan. According to Akhtar, while political issues often dominate media coverage of Pakistan, SAAMA's vision is to engage audiences and present new event implications across political, social, and economic platforms. It aims towards a solution- oriented stage as opposed to mere problem focus, by ideas, involving alliances, compromises, conflicts and rivalry for attention, so is the democratic system. Win - ners in the innovative system implement their ideas on the market, with power lying in citizens' money, while winners in the democratic system implement their ideas on society and power lies in the citizen's votes. While the role of political journalism is recognized, the role of innovation journalism needs to be recognized, since journalism is key to connecting the innovation economy and democratic society. The innovation economy is also an attention econ - omy. Since innovation is the introduction of something new, getting out ideas must survive selection, includ - ing decisions of funding, customers, and public policy. Since attention is a scarce commodity, attention workers are actors that compete for people's attention, including journalists. The innovation communication system deals with the flow of attention among people, enterprises, institutions, which is key to an innovation process. We need this in an economic system because collective at - tention is the focus of our collective intelligence, where our collective action can create the most effect. Thus, instead of focusing on the medium, we should focus on how we can reach the audience and gain their attention. Innovation needs a name (so we can refer to it), a definition (so we know what it is), a business model (so we can sustain it), and a narrative (so we can relate to it). Productive journalism can speed up innovation, since the news shapes and spreads the new words and narratives so that things can be discussed and people can decide which products they want, making our economy more competitive. Reporting on innovation economy empowers readers and democratic society alike, but how can it be bro - kered? First of all, the vertical newsroom which divides topics of science, technology, business and finance, politics and culture must be changed, since innovation is a horizontal topic, spanning multiple areas. If this is not done, the audience will only receive bits and pieces of information, which they can't put together into their collective conscience. While the innovation economy is global, most international journalism is political, and business/ technological journalism is national. Inter - national journalism reporting on innovation and the creation of value is needed by reporting on both prob - lems and on how to solve them. Not many areas have the potential to bring integrated topics into a wider picture that sparks innovation, like journalism can. Now the newsroom must be changed into an innovative one, which reports on innovation, and by doing so acts as a driver in an innovative society. The second panelist, Ulrik Haagerup, spoke on constructive journalism. Constructive journalism is about using journalism to bring new solutions and inspire people to do things differently in an innovation economy. Haagerup discussed the old days of journalism with a patterned function from content to production, to distribution, to the user. Now, however, content can be brought directly to the user. He compared journalism to the porn industry, both of which are losing money because people neither want to pay for high-quality porn nor high-quality stories, since they are available for free online. To demonstrate to the audience the stubbornness of journalism to swap its old models for new, innovative ones, he asked the audience to count the number of capi - tal 'F's in a text. The majority of the audience under-counted by reading words, not individual letters, using the techniques they were taught. Likewise, journalists are criticized by the wider public for being too negative, yet their stubbornness to change and bring people the stories they want is astounding. This is not just the prob - lem of journalism, but rather a human problem, with 90 percent of people being unable to change their habits even if they know they will kill them. To put it bluntly, Haagerup said, if journalism doesn't change, 90 percent of the industry, too, will die. The question journalists have to ask themselves is whether they are giving the best version of the truth to the public, or are their bad habits painting a negative image? Living in an innovation age where they have to come up with new stuff to survive means they have to live in a culture where it is accepted to make mistakes and take risks. Taking the motto from Starbucks, who defines itself as 'in the people business serving coffee', Haagerup posed the question whether journalists are in the journalism business serving people or the people business serving journalism.

Discussion When questioned about the overly positive aims of SAAMA, Akhtar claimed that although it is their job to report on issues, bringing hope to the people and not making Pakistan's name synonymous with negative images is crucial to the country's future. They have also carried out watchdog projects where, for instance, they used the media to inform the people and administration about the necessity that children obtain polio vaccina - tions. As a result, 22,000 children were vaccinated. Dur - ing a prime-time show, they raised the issue of terrorism but accompanied it with a panel of people who talked about solutions. In other words, integrating the audience into the program and let them discuss practical solutions is much more advisable than tackling the issues at stake on a purely political level. When responding to an audience member's remark that positive reporting does not allow journalists to be critical and independent, Haagerup stated that it is not just about reporting positive news, but also horrible news. We have to balance the news, not so it tips, but so we can take various issues into account. Nordfors added that innovation is incorrectly seen as a buzz word for positivity, adding that not all innovations are good in - struments - one such example being the financial crisis. What journalists need is to break out of story-telling categories and do quality journalism on the process of innovation, as SAAMA does. One audience member asked if public broadcasters are in a better position to change the business model towards constructive journalism. Haagerup replied that public broadcasters have a social responsibility to do so, thus signifying our responsibility to society and not to our owners. Nordfors claimed that it is necessary to change from mere public service broadcast to public ser - vice journalism, which includes other media, as a model for future journalism. When asked about the public's reaction to SAAMA's approach, Akhtar responded that the program is very popular. One show, which presents problems and lo - cal solutions, is extremely popular, and citizens seem to appreciate new means of media that promote citizen participation. One audience member questioned whether this model would work in the Western world, where people have become desensitized to violence and blood, requiring more and more to get the same response. Would the audience really care? Akhtar responded that it is time for journalists to paint a real picture of the world - that it is not that bad of a place. Nordfors added that desensitization only happens if people feel they can't do anything about the problems presented. If solutions are shown, this won't happen. One participant asked how journalism in conflict- ridden zones can show both sides, when hosting an opposition member can label journalists collaborators. Akhtar affirmed that SAAMA condemns terrorism, and because the government also condemns it, that is why the militants go on. SAAMA instead focuses on letting citizens from conflict-ridden zones tell their own stories through citizen journalism and get involved; a crucial aspect of the democratic process. When a participant asked about the logic in Western reporters now go - ing back to the community again, after years of telling reporters from various regions the importance of report - ing objectively and less from the community, Wilfried Ruetten answered that they are not going backwards, because they never had it before. Thus, according to the panel discussion, the newsroom in times of financial crisis and a breakup of traditional media needs to think critically and bring constructive innovative journalism for the audience to participate in problem-solving and innovation. Whether this may be labeled as going back - wards or forwards, it does involve journalism taking a step to meet the innovative society. | Courtney FosterWorkshoP on GerMan/ aMerican covera Ge oF terroris M issues - a transatlantic MeDia coMP arison hoste D by rias b erlin binGer, journalist, c ommission, Washington, D c, usa Panelists: Davi D Patrician, journalist, usa / Germany Joachi M anGerer, documentary editor, West German b roadcasting c orporation (WD r), Germany Michael Groth, correspondent for Deutschland radio, c ologne / b erlin, Germany MiGual Mar Quez, journalist, abc n ews, usa / l ondon Jochen t ies, Deutschlandradio, berlin Terrorism has existed since the dawn of mankind; however, it was not until 9/11 that it became a major theme for the media. Since then, not only has terrorism been radicalized by the United States but it has also been widely portrayed by the media. German and American journalists came together for this workshop to discuss how television and other forms of electronic media cover terrorism since the horrific attacks of 9/11. As was evident throughout the workshop, there are major differences in terrorism reporting between German and American media. To depict the influence of terrorism on everybody's lives, Jon Ebinger opened the panel by asking where panelists were when they first heard about 9/11. All panelists knew and talked about their whereabouts at the time, and there seemed to be general consensus that a new type of nervousness arose in the wake of the attacks. US media, particularly, began investing millions of dol - lars in recruiting terrorism analysts to slake the publics' thirst for such information. These terrorism analysts informed the public by following terrorist activity in conflict zones and commenting on the change in terror - ist threat levels. In addition, a plethora of reporters were sent to Iraq, Afghanistan, and other conflict zones to report on issues of terrorism. In contrast, while German media sources did focus somewhat on terrorism developments, reporting on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan did not seem to be a prior - Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009rias Worksho P on G erMan/a Merican covera Ge oF terroris M issues - a transatlantic M eDia 173 172 Worksho Ps on M eDia tranin G, Develo PMent an D ProDuctionity. Michael Groth indicated that during the initial stages of the Afghan war, there were no German reporters in that country. The nearest one was in Delhi and was re - sponsible for reporting on the entire South Asian region; a task that can be quite strenuous for journalists. Groth went on that while terrorism has not impacted Germany, there may come a time when terrorists strike. He also mentioned the factor of money, which plays a major role since many German media stations would need to provide a salary for terrorism analysts, their travel, etc. German media corporations do not depend fully on advertizing as the US media do. David Patrician noted that the Bush administration radicalized terrorism in the wake of the attacks which further compelled the media to approach this topic. The Obama administration, however, has been heavily criticized by conservatives for its friendly posture toward the Middle East. He went on to state that time is not on the side of Israel whose relationship with the Middle East can best be described as dire. With regard to Tur - key, Patrician mentioned that it seems that its citizens are fed up with Europe and are seeking other allies in their neighboring region. Jochen Ties, a special correspondent in the Berlin bureau of Deutschlandradio, mentioned that Germany is currently \"inward looking\" as 2009 is an election year. Germany is not concentrating on terrorism or the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and, in addition, Ties stated that Germans have difficulty relating to events, occurring in conflict zones far away from Germany. Ebinger asked the panelists whether there has been a change in the US administration on terrorism cover - age. Manuel Marquez answered that Obama cannot escape the fact that the United States is still a superpower and terroristic threats against it still exist. In addition, Marquez mentioned that US media has been supported through advertising but this is rapidly changing. He indicated each country's media prioritizes issues based upon its own interests. In Pakistan, for instance, citi - zens are not represented fairly in the media and this has caused significant backlash in recent years. Groth and Ties both concurred by citing the example of the Turk - ish minority in Germany. The German media fails to represent the Turkish population fairly so that the mi - nority has resorted to reading Turkish newspapers such as the H\u00fcrriyet as the news source of choice. Audience members were concerned with the future of journalism and the portrayal of terrorism. The ques - tion arose whether journalists have freedom of move - ment in conflict zones throughout the world. Marquez stated that while security in Iraq has improved dra - matically within the last couple of years, the freedom to move about has declined. Ties, on the other hand, mentioned that he has not encountered any major secu - rity issues while reporting in conflict zones. He recalled that he wore body armor only once. Groth stated that personal security for journalists is of utmost importance. He added that particularly in countries where English is not spoken, it is essential for journalists to gain access to interpreters. Groth noted that Afghans, for instance, are not known to answer questions directly and this can cause great difficulty in reporting. This however, is typical in \"high context societies\" (Edward Hall) where cultures are more inward-looking. All panelists agreed that the traditional style of journalism is diminishing. They stated that these days, anyone with a camera and an opinion can produce 'jour - nalism' and feared that due to the lack of well-trained journalists, rampant abuse of reporting has been occur - ring worldwide. Fox News, a conservative media outlet in the United States, is primarily 'editorial based' in that it wishes to influence attitudes. | Edward Ceska Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009rias P on G erMan/a Merican covera Ge oF terroris M issues - a transatlantic M eDia co MParison 175 174 Worksho Ps on M eDia tranin G, Develo PMent an D ProDuctionneWs an D inForMation D esiGn For auDio-visual MeDia\u2014hoW theatrical can , MiGht or shoul D it be ? hoste D by e yes & e ars o F euroPe chair: Wout n ierho FF, ceo e yes & e ars of e urope, Germany Panelists: Peter kloePP el, editor-in- chief rtl t elevision, Germany ProF.

With regard to content it seems that these two notions are to be seen as extremes. But on closer examination, the use of theatrics can be helpful to generate news and information which can be more easily understood, especially in the days of digitalization and ephemerality. The central question of this session was how to handle that 'dilemma' of using theatrics in presenting news and information. The first topic \"Let's talk about sets - real and virtu - al\" was presented by Peter Kloeppel and Manfred Beck - er. They began by presenting a short video of their work as broadcasters. Since the news on RTL is aired live, topicality and comprehensibility are very important. But how can high comprehensibility be reached and how can the news be supported by graphics and design? Kloep - pel emphasized that news on TV is to be seen different to news in print media. It is essential for audio-visual news to directly catch the attention of the audience since it's not possible to reread the information given on TV. Hence graphics and design are essential to mak - ing the news easily understandable and colorful. Becker asked if there is pressure on the journalists since they are expected to constantly enhance their presentation of the news by using these technologies. In this context, Kloeppel talked about an evolution, which has taken and is still taking place in the field of audio-visual media where one always needs to overcome creative challenges to continue enhancing the quality of the presented news. In this respect, he also explained that the quality of the news is not only determined by how the news are being transported but also by the point in time, since topicality is one of the most important factors in the business. By answering the chair's question whether virtual or natural sets are preferable, Kloeppel explained that none is bet - ter or worse than the other. A mixture in which a high grade of flexibility is possible would be best. The next presentation \"promoting News on n-tv\" was held by Christoph Teuner and Christoph Hammer - schmidt. They first gave an overview of \"Positioning and market\" and reported that n-tv, founded in 1992, is the first German news channel. In their eyes, the core competences of the broadcaster are presenting news and business news seven days a week around the clock. They are live on air between 7 a.m. and midnight. In 2008 the then small natural set was replaced by a virtual design which made the studio appear much larger. But it's not only the size of the set that makes it appear more repre - sentative, thanks to virtual editing, but also the changed color makes the set more appealing to the audience. Blue used to be the color for news and seriousness, but, ac - cording to Hammerschmidt, this has changed these days into white with some red. They continued by explaining that virtual und graphic design is not only important for the set, but also for charts and diagrams. Agreeing with what was said by previous speakers, Hammerschmidt and Teuner explained that animated graphics and vir - tual video casts offer more background information and make the news more understandable for the audience.

During Christoph Mecke's presentation \"From Black List to White List...\" he talked about the newly founded \"Liquid Campaign\". He started by explaining 'blacklist - ing' and 'white listing'. First, he pointed out that 'get - ting the stuff you want by eliminating the junk' is called blacklisting, white listing is about news selection based on trust or recommendation. Accordingly, both black - listing and white listing are instruments used to select and distinguish information and news. According to Mecke, this seems to be necessary as there is too much information. He stressed that listeners are no longer consuming information, they are processing it, which explains the multiplicity of information. Because of that, not the source, but the distribution channel and the pro - cessing of the news are important for success in the new media. He explained that processing the news is part of the design. Liquid Campaign, for instance, analyzes the most popular issues discussed in the web by a tool called \"opinion mining monitor\" to keep up with the times. Anton Riedel and Florian Woegerer continued the session with their presentation on \"TEEVEEFX - instant branding\". They pointed to the importance of brandings in today's world by showing that some products are being sold at different prices even if they have the very same content. This proves that people are paying for brands and therefore for the design. Having a look at the media sector, the trend in our digitalized world shows that users are more and more involved in producing and generating information and news them - selves. Examples like \"Wikipedia\", \"Voices of Africa\", \"I-Report\" and many more confirm that. As has been shown earlier, brands and therefore designs, play a very important role, not only with goods and products but also with media. In response to that, the international creative agency FEEDMEE in Cologne develops cross- media web applications and designs with user-generated content to support users who want to express themselves or who like to post and archive their images. TeeveeFX is an interactive toolkit, which can be used to edit pho - tographs or videos by adding graphic elements and music for instance. Discussion The discussion with Wolfram Winter and Bjoern Bar - tholdy summarized the aspects addressed in the session. It was highlighted that brands and hence also designs are of great importance in the media, because of the differ - ent requirements of users. Design and theatricality are used to release emotions, even with music as a tool. But in this context it was also stressed that the use of differ - ent designs should not be overloaded and can irritate the user. The more designed something is, the more ephem - eral it is. This is why despite the importance of designs and theatricality they need to be used with care. Winter and Bartholdy also pointed out that the design of a certain product, goods or any distributing channel in the media has another important function: It also defines its individual identity, which is characterized by high grade of complexity. Having a unique identity is of great concern within the new media since users have to deal with a multiplicity of information, provider and distribution channels. Therefore, theatricality can be seen as a method to express one's own character and identity. | Claudia Tesfainew media like twitter and blogs, since the quality and the validity of the information are not guaranteed. \"The ORF Newsroom\" was represented by Elisa - beth Trotzauer and Rupert Putz, who also started their presentation with a short video cast of ORF. ORF does not work with a virtual set, but in a real studio in which the hosts are able to move freely. Putz emphasized that ORF has made the decision to work without special effects and virtual design since they believe that news presented from a natural setting is more neutral and ob - jective. In contrast to what had been said in the previous presentations, Trotzauer argued that ORF works with real pictures and graphics aiming to make the news more authentic and better understandable for the audience. The exclusive use of real pictures and graphics is one of the core values of ORF and is part of their corporate philosophy. Additionally, the speakers pointed out that by not using virtual design they gain competitive advan - tage. Trotzauer and Putz emphasized, that real pictures are very emotional while the design of the set as well as the way to transport the news should be as neutral as possible. They concluded with the statement that design should balance the emotional intensity. The next presenter for the section titled \"Music for news and documentaries\" was Anselm Kreuzer, who started by asking of how theatrical can, might or should music be. Kreuzer explained that music can and is often being used for propaganda purposes. Therefore music needs to be handled with care. But why is music used for such purposes and what makes music theatrical? He pointed out that music appears theatrical when it is combined with a certain event in the past or even in the future. Additionally, he explained that music is rather emotional than theatrical which is also the reason why music is often being used for promoting outstanding events for instance. This underlines the fact that theatricality is used as an instrument to release emotions. However, theatricality is not always the right medium - it depends on the context. He made clear that some theatricality in the news is helpful for competition and makes regional news more attractive. Even in documentaries, music might be theatrical, but it depends on the topic. An audience member brought up the issue that theatrical music - especially in documentaries - is often annoying Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009neWs an D inForMation D esiGn For au Dio-visual M eDia - ho W theatrical can, M iGht or shoul D it be? 179 178 Worksho Ps M eDia tranin G, Develo PMent an D ProDuctionassessin G MeDia lan DscaPes in con Flict situations hoste D by the c enter F or innovation F or Me Dia, c onFlict, an D Peacebuil DinG at the us i nstitute o F Peace ( usiP) sPeaker: shelD on executive Director u nited s tates i nstitute of Peace, Washington, usa Sheldon Himelfarb presented a project he and a col - league, Eran Fraenkel, are developing. They aim to establish a framework for assessing media characteristics in conflict zones for peacebuilding purposes. The final product would be practitioner-oriented, but also use - ful to a wide range of groups including media makers, project funding organizations, and academics. Himelfarb explained that the project had reached a 'checkpoint' and that they were now looking for feedback on whether it is headed in the right direction. He started by introducing USIP as an independent and non-partisan institution that was created by Con - gress 25 years ago with the objective of increasing the US's conflict management capabilities. Some of their activities include research, funding and implementing projects. By dint of USIP receiving financing from Con - gress, they do sometimes have the attention of US politi - cians, remarked Himelfarb. Within the structure of the organization there are three main branches: The Center for Conflict Analysis and Prevention, The Center for Mediation and Conflict Resolution, and The Center for Post-Conflict Peace and Stability Operations. Himelfarb works in both the Science, Technology, and Peacebuild - ing and the Media, Conflict, and Peacebuilding depart - ments, which explains the nature of the project currently under way. The aim, he reiterated, is to create an assessment model that can be shared and applied by all who work in the media field. He felt that the current knowledge is limited in four ways: its consideration of the media as a single entity separate from other aspects of soci - ety, such as the conflict itself; its focus on activities and not on outcomes; the fact that it is disconnected from monitoring and evaluation; and the lack of coordination between organizations resulting in wasted resources. To avoid the first pitfall, the starting logic of any assess - ment would have to be that the media cannot be viewed in isolation. Therefore, the personnel that carry out the work cannot all be from the media field, there must be political scientists, country specialists, etc. Himelfarb presented a slide that illustrated the three interconnected entities that would have to be studied in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding: the state, the media landscape, and the conflict. For example, a slide pre - sented later showed a graphic of the analysis that would take place of the 'state of the media' which would hope to identify kinds of media, ownership, orientation, audi - ence, and contents. Two other issues that Himelfarb discussed were identification of the purposes and possibilities for ac - tion and whether media is being targeted or used as a tool. The first issue reflects a need to establish a goal and to be pragmatic when determining what can actu - ally be achieved on the ground in a given situation. He presented examples of each: social marketing or user- generated media would be considered media as a tool; journalism might be both (depending on whether the aim was capacity-building or if it was used as a means Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009assessin G MeDia lan DscaPes in con Flict situations 181 180 Worksho Ps on M eDia tranin G, Develo PMent an D ProDuctionto something else); and infrastructure development and strengthening of regulations would fall under the cat - egory of media as a target. In short, a distinction must be made between whether the objective is to improve the media in a country, or to use it in the process of achiev - ing a different goal, such as education. The overall process would help to map out objec - tives, clarify levels of impact, determine the realistic obstacles to any given project, and suggest strategies that may be pursued. All of this complex information, argued Himelfarb, will be made manageable by being expressed in numeric figures and processed in a computer pro - gram. The final result, after an estimated two to three months of work, will answer the question whether the proposed project is worth being carried out, or as Hime - lfarb put it, whether \"the juice is worth the squeeze\". Before opening the floor up to questions, he took the opportunity to introduce a new website, peacemedia. usip.org, which is basically the aggregated information in circulation regarding media usage. Discussion Throughout the workshop concern was expressed over the issue of funding for this phase of a project. It was one of the first points a participant raised after the presenta - tion. The issue is that donors are will fund activities, but not studies. In connection with this, another member of the audience took the view that the tool being developed would be helpful for activity-oriented organizations in order to more effectively implement projects and as - sess the interests of funders, but not as something to be sold to a donor. To this, Himelfarb explained that he understood people's caution; however, he thought that this process would be in the best interest of the donors as well. It would help them to choose the projects that best fit their objectives. He provided the example of USIP, which is currently financing a similar study, expressing hope that other organizations will follow. Another question was how researchers would un - cover new data if the short period allocated to the pro - cess would only allow them to review existing data. The answer to which, Himelfarb felt, was rapid quantitative analyses. These would be quicker than qualitative as - sessments and allow for a general sense of the media situation in a given country. Another different partici -pant wondered what interaction with local groups there would be. This was an issue that was still to be worked out; however, Himelfarb felt that it would be during the 'Purpose and Possibilities' section of the study that local input would be considered. A third topic touched upon was impact assessment. One participant posed the question of how one would assess the impact of a prevention campaign, while an - other pointed out that while changes can be observed, causality is more difficult to prove. Having a clear objec - tive is important in this case, explained Himelfarb. The type of assessment that is performed will depend on the original aims. It is, however, a complicated and, often, underfunded aspect of projects. Furthermore, he urged everyone to let go of the idea of the 'perfect answer'. Practical limitations will never allow for this, so it is important to work with the options that are available to take whatever useful information from a study that is possible. In sum, many audience members seemed to express interest and hope in the future of the project. | Evan BerardMoney an D MeDia\u2014hoW the F inancial crisis hits Journalis M hoste D by Deutsche Welle chair: anDreas s toPP, Deutschlandfunk, cologne, Germany Panelists: rolan D e ditor-in- chief, Wirtschaftswoche, Duesseldorf, Germany helM ut heinen, President, Federation of German n ewspaper Publishers, b erlin, Germany erik betterM ann, Director General, Deutsche Welle, b onn, Germany cristiana Falcone, Director Media and e ntertainment i ndustries, World e conomic Forum usa i nc., n ew y ork, usa Andreas Stopp's first question concerned the quality of news coverage of the financial crisis. Did journalists report early enough on its dimensions? Have they suf- ficiently addressed the topic ever since? Cristiana Falcone argued that it is not true that the financial crisis was not covered but it certainly did not make the headlines. Many journalists were actually too embedded in the financial system, Falcone said. A great self-assessment on the part of the financial reporter was required to become aware of that. This is equally true for the World Economic Forum, which as a multi-stake - holder initiative made similar mistakes as other institutes in this respect. On the business side, the financial crisis severely hit journalism; global revenue has been going down. How - ever, negative business trends existed before the financial crisis and were merely accelerated by it, Falcone empha - sized. Ronald Tichy stressed that the Wirtschaftswoche (a weekly enonomic magazine) ran the first cover story of the financial crisis in Germany. However, no one be - lieved that there was something like a global financial crisis which he puts down to sheer ignorance. Only after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy did aware - ness arise about the extent of the crisis. This, of course also poses the question of when a crisis is in fact a crisis, Tichy emphasized. But why did consumers not realize that the status of the financial system posed a real threat to the world economy? Stopp persisted. For whom have financial correspondents been reporting? Is only the expert able to understand the news coverage of the financial crisis? Tichy countered that there has to be a general willing - ness to understand complex interdependencies in order to understand the topic. In Germany, he claimed, this willingness has been lacking for a long time. With the majority of Germans used to a financial system of sav - ings banks, financial speculations and its threats were not on the agenda. For a long time, Germans believed that the financial crisis was happening somewhere else. The financial crisis also took newspapers by surprise, Helmut Heinen said. At least, no one was expecting the dimensions showing right now. As the newspaper business is affected, it also has to deal with the crisis.

Taking a well- established brand like the New York Times online can be a successful business model. In the end, media companies must clearly position themselves. Deutsche Welle does that by an awareness of its responsibility for journalistic expertise. This includes offering an excellent education for young journalists. More than 2,000 train each year with Deutsche Welle Academy, Bettermann told the audience. It is Deutsche Welle's idea that the countries in which Deutsche Welle operates should not only be provided with information but should also be given the opportunity to receive a solid journalistic education. Discussion In the open discussion the questions again centered on how journalists dealt with the financial crisis in the early stages that journalists reported on it too late. One partic - ipant accused journalists of having written the crisis into existence. Here, Tichy took a clear stance. Journalists could only be blamed for one of the two reasons, but not both. Moreover, he again stressed the paradoxical situ - ation in which journalists found themselves. In a way, their information had the power to self-destruct. In this situation they had to find the right balance between the disclosure of facts and the maintenance of the system, in which they have been embedded as well. Concerning the business side, no one knows the long-term effects the financial crisis will have on news - papers and other media companies. During these critical times, a number of broadcasters are likely to go bank - rupt, Bettermann said. This would, however, be much worse in Africa where the role of the media in education and democracy promotion is much more important. Therefore, saving public broadcasters by public bailout could be a reasonable option. Moreover, Bettermann voiced concern about devel - opments on the news agency market. Most news agen - cies are now controlled by just a few shareholders, he said. Because of this, journalists should critically reflect where the information they use comes from. Overall, the crisis has certainly left a mark on jour - nalism - both on the financial and on the reporting side. However, as Tichy said in the end: \"If there were no crises, there would be no media.\" | Katrin DauenhauerAmong others, the business has to ask itself if traditional newspapers are still up to date with technological prog - ress, Heinen said. On this point, Falcone specified that the Western newspaper market in general is down, as is advertising spending, while the Chinese and Indian markets are growing. Erik Bettermann agreed that the media business suffered from the financial crisis. Even though Deutsche Welle is financed to a large extent by state money, the financial crisis also hit the broadcaster. And as the crisis will continue to affect the public budgets, the effects are likely to become more noticeable for Deutsche Welle in the future. As for the journalistic side, it is important to not only do investigative work but also to provide explanations for the crisis as well as background information, Bet - termann argued. However, this is particularly difficult as simple explanations are insufficient to understand the current crisis. Moreover, Bettermann complained that for a long time many German media have looked at the development in the United States more as voyeurs rather than as critical observers. There is no simple answer on how to report on the crisis, Tichy stressed. What to do when the event has not yet happened? Do we want reporters to write the financial crisis into existence? Tichy asked. Generally, crises develop. Moreover, many facts do not manifest themselves as events. How do reporters deal with those? Tichy asked. Tackling the effects of the crisis for the media busi - ness, the solution cannot be to cut down on the number of journalists, Heinen argued. Instead, the quality of reporting has to be raised. His opinion was shared by Bettermann. The financial crisis should be seen as a chance for media companies to increase transparency and equality of opportunity. The business sections of German newspapers would sometimes be difficult to understand, he criticized. More international expertise would be needed in German newspapers. Moreover, qualified journalists would be expected to take on the role of a 'scout'. To counter the crisis, newspapers will have to adopt technological progress, Tichy argued. Another option could be a multi-platform approach, Falcone suggested.

In the era of global and social networking, good news spreads around the world with the speed of light and bad news even faster. But this is not a distinguishing fact about news today. The difference is the local accessibility to news and its rapidity. The swift spread of technological gadgets, In - ternet and mobile phones allows not only journalists and reporters a simpler intake and broadcasting of material, but also an evasion of governmental censorship, local blockages, and filtering. But today not only journalists and trained personnel claim the privilege of accessing and reporting for them - selves. Free access to Internet blogs, social networking, and websites such as twitter, Facebook, vlogs, YouTube, etc. and the possession of technical devices such as mo - bile phones and pocket-size digital cameras could turn anyone into a reporter, into a wannabe-journalist, etc. In an era when incidents take place affecting all man - kind, where human rights are crushed with the growing power of dictatorship, where man-made and device-generated disasters take place or force majeure steps in, swift and fluent reporting is the major key to the access of daily happenings to people around the world. Since the me-dia cannot always guarantee the presence of jour - nalists at every occurrence, pictures and videos are often captured by spectators who happen to be at the right place at the right time. This is an advantage of advanced technology.Media diversity does not necessarily imply correct jour - nalism, quality journalism and responsible journalism. Responsible quality journalism and coverage would tie bonds of understanding, friendship and unity. It would call attention to misery and injustice, it would broaden human awareness. Irresponsible journalism and incor - rect news dissemination could risk hostilities and lead to inexorable disasters such as inter-ethnic clashes and fan the flames of animosity. This year's symposium for journalistic training dealt with the modern trends and challenges in the multi-media era. In this booklet, strategies will be discussed which would enable journalists to adapt to the new, high- speed and advanced technological progress of the media world. Chapter 1 is about re-thinking journalism. Does jour - nalism have to prepare for an uncertain future? The ever growing diversity of news presentations and users' access to media, and the almost explosive expansion of data and contents, raise not only new possibilities, but also challenges. How do these developments impact on journalism? What are their implications for journalism education and training? Who can now be defined as a journalist and what distinguishes a well-trained one from others? What does the future of journalism look like and who will judge the importance of one theme over another? Marko Milosavljevic from the Department of Journalism at the University of Ljubljana/Slovenia posits three scenes which distinguish the significance of ques - tioning and reporting as well as differentiating between important and irrelevant topics. Prof. Michael Krzem - inski of the Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences outlines the future of journalism, while Adam Waterhead, Project Manager of the Com-monwealth Broadcasting Association, raises the question of who is and who is not a journalist now. Chapter 2 deals with the advantages of modern technol - ogy and digital devices over obsolete methods. Digital technology allows projects and coverage and alterations inconceivable in the analogue era. The appearance of MP3s, laptops, cell phones and DV-cameras greatly simplifies carrying, archiving, cutting and broadcast - ing methods. This chapter not only deals with praising the new techniques, difficulties and disadvantages of such new devices are also discussed. Furthermore, many archives hold priceless and invaluable information and historical data which have to be remastered and pre - served for future generations. Ms Brenda Burrell of the Kubatana Trust of Zimbabwe describes the impact of reaching the general public by the use of mobile tech- nology and the Internet in order to reach a new level of awareness towards important issues of Zimbabwean society, e.g. HIV, social and economic crisis. Ms Hoah Binh, the Audio Centre Director of the radio station \"The Voice of Vietnam\" and Heidrun Speckmann of DW- AKADEMIE outline methods of remastering and storing old material. Chapter 3 addresses the importance of journalism train - ing and whether it makes sense to do any. Good jour - nalism has long-term effects. This is the main key to improving global development and democratic develop - ments. But journalists are prone to different influences and are forced to work within complex systems. Freedom of speech and media as well as economic independence are only two of many factors which could promote or prevent professional journalism. Investigating the ham - pering or the supporting factors in this area belongs to the discussions in this group. Prof. Dr. Guy Berger from Rhodes University of South Africa outlines the politi - cal situation of media control and media regulations and makes suggestions on improving the nuisance of redun - dant and incongruous regulations. Lastly, chapter 4 deals with different aspects of social media journalism. Its focus is on quality journalism. How is it defined? The significance is that only credibil - ity and verifiability constitute good media. Does quality journalism have a chance to survive or will it drown in a vortex of irrelevant projections and perceptions? How can a quality journalist capture the attention of viewers, readers and spectators without having to bend to mass sensationalism and incorrect coverage? How can good journalists widen the awareness of others towards quality work? Ms Emer Beamer, the Research and Development Director of Butterfly Works in The Netherlands, talks about Alfred Sakwa Sabatia, the 23 year-old Kenyan winner of the Unsung Peace Heroes Prize for his efforts to create a culture of peace. Furthermore, she talks about a platform conceived and executed by Butterfly Works named \"Ushahidi\". This website, originally developed to map reports about violence in Kenya after the post-elec - tion fallout early in 2008, now monitors the 2009 Indian elections, the spread of swine flu and other happenings. Ms Ulrike Langer, a German journalist specializing in media affairs, describes the journalistic strategies for competing on the web 2.0. She outlines the distinctions between web 1.0 and web 2.0 and illuminates the proper placement of stories. She gives tips and suggestions for elaborating and developing the benefits of web 2.0 and how to improve its advantages by thinking multimedi - ally, by making use of crowd-sourcing and last but not least, being open to new media without risking the rules of ethics. Chapter 5 covers the media diversity of training for a digital world. Dr. Javad Motthagi, Director of Asia-Pacific Institute for Broadcasting Development (AIBD) in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, points out the explo - sion of technologies - blogging, online encyclopedias, podcasting/videocasts and the connection of knowledge and resources. Afterwards he speaks about how new technologies can assist journalists in developing countries in conflict and post-conflict settings. In this regard, he gives an idea about what this means for training activi - ties. Further Mr Makunike, a journalist, African web entrepreneur, and online writer in Zimbabwe/Senegal, describes the evolving role of digital media in Africa. In the next section, Mr Matthias Spielkamp, journalist, consultant and lecturer in Berlin, explains the meaning of web logs and whether they are a sound and serious source of journalistic information. He speaks about the blogger's role in and influence on journalism. Jotman, a blogger from Thailand, gives an impression from the view of a blogger and speaks about his own experi - ences. G in the social M eDia aGe Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009192 syMPosiu M 193a Malaysian online publication, gives an overview of journalistic training for a digital world. This chapter is concluded by Staffan Sonning, head of Corporate Strate - gy of Swedish Radio, who talks about the need for speed and the erosion of media ethics. The central theme of chapter 6 is the impact of education on peace and conflict and what journalists and peacebuild - ing practitioners need to know about it. In this chapter we look at the role of the media in the prevention of violent conflict. It points out the different strategies to positively impact violent conflict and shows which media channels are most effective in impacting audience. Also it gives an idea about what journalists need to know and how their work can impact conflict and peace. Vladimir Bratic, As - sistant Professor of Media and Communications at Hollins University, Virginia, USA, and Lisa Schirch, Program Director of the 3D Security Initiative and Professor of Peacebuilding at Eastern Mennonite University, Virginia, USA, give a science-based lecture on theory and practice. opening address GerD a Meuer, Director, DW- akaDeMie, Germany Ladies and gentlemen, honored guests - we are here today to talk about social media. But first, let's talk about birds. Everyone is twittering these days. So ornithology might provide insight into our new era of social media. Now, we all know that many birds sing. Well, ornithol - ogists know that when they sing, birds are sending out messages to the world around them. Like \"Hey, you're cute!\" - If it is mating season.And \"This is my branch\" - if it is nesting season. And \"Watch out! A cat!\" - in any season. Normally, this goes on mostly at dawn and dusk. But scientists have found out that birds in European cities have changed the way they communicate. First, some birds are singing louder. Compared to their country cousins, they are as much as 14 decibels louder. Other birds are singing at a higher pitch than normal.And a lot of birds are turning the night to day, and war - bling under the street lamps. Why have they changed their ways? The answer is obvi -ous - cities are noisy and they keep getting noisier, and it is harder to be heard during the day. So the birds have found new strategies to adapt to their environment. Ladies and gentlemen, honored guests - it is my pleasure to welcome you to our jour-nalistic training symposium today: \"Re- inventing Journalism? - Journalistic Train - ing in the Social Media Age\". Just like the birds, journalists are reacting and adapting to the changes in the media landscape, where the ever expanding availability of information is making it easier - and in some ways harder - to be heard. But while birds are competing with the growling of trucks, the honking of horns and the chatter of people in crowds, their tweets are a unique form of communica - tion. They set them apart. Now, what if the people in crowds were tweeting, too? Like they were when terrorists attacked hotels and res - taurants in Mumbai .... Like they were in New York, when the first pictures from a passenger plane crash in the Hudson River were sent from the cell phone of a passer-by... Like they were in Winnenden , here in Germany, when the first \"news flash\" from a school shooting was a mes - sage - a Tweet - from a girl to her friends and boyfriend. A simple note, warning them not to come into town... Today, you do not need to be a journalist to break a story. Because social media net-works like twitter, Friendfeed, etc. have made everyone a market crier. Media institutions like newspapers, radio and television broadcasters and online sites are no longer the gatekeep - ers of information. The news ticker is not fed by wire serv-ices, but by ordinary people. The eye witness has now become a \"citizen reporter\". But is that really the most important job that professional journalists have? Tweeting out the news? Or is that just for the birds? Any journalist will tell you that they don't spend most of their time writing the story - but rather gathering information and analyzing it. Sifting and sorting through the facts and figures. Talking to people, listening to their experiences, digging deeper. Asking hard questions, hearing the good, the bad and the ugly. Then they take all of that information and weigh it, proof it, fact check it. They qualify it, contextualize it. And they bring together actions with reactions to tell stories about the world we live in.Today. That is what journalists have been doing up until today. Those have been our core values. But what about tomorrow? What will be the role of journalists in the future? Already there are Internet sites that aggregate informa - tion for us from media and other sources all over the globe. And crowds - not individuals - are working together online and giving us a broad range of perspectives and up-to-the-minute information on developing stories. The sounds all around us are NOT the white noise of the city. We have to react to them, but is it enough to be louder, hit it at a different frequency or wait until all is quiet? Shouldn't we learn from the birds - and realize that the information highway is no longer a oneway street? That news doesn't go out into nirvana and the world is send - ing it right back at us?Shouldn't we be integrating the other voices, responding to them, learning from them? That is what social media is about, too. But how do we, as journalists, do that and still make a place for ourselves and our institutions in the crowd? And how do we prepare other journalists and the media they work for to deal with this rapidly changing media landscape - when we ourselves are struggling to face the challenge of understanding what media is and what it can mean? I don't have the answers. But I hope that this symposium will give us an opportunity to discuss and debate these changes, the reinvention of journalism and give some outlook into the role we as journalists and as trainers and media consultants at the DW-AKADEMIE - can help to adapt to and facilitate these changes in the future. As Dan Gillmor wrote in 2004, news reporting and pro - duction is no longer a lecture. It is a conversation. And that is what I look forward to today.Panel 1 Re-thinking journalism? Preparing for an uncertain future Drowning in a sea of irrelevance? Marko Milosavl Jevic, Department of Journalism, u niversity of ljubljana First scene: Socrates once wrote how the god Theuth commends his new invention of writing to the Egyptian king, Thamus. \"Here is an accomplishment,\" he said, \"which will im - prove both the wisdom and mem-ory of the Egyptians. I have discovered a sure recipe for memory and wisdom.\" To this Thamus replied: \"You, who are the father of writing, have out of fondness for your offspring attrib - uted to it the opposite of its real function. Those who acquire it will cease to exercise their memory and be - come forgetful; they will rely on writing to bring things to their remembrance by external signs instead of by their own internal resources. What you have discovered is a recipet for recollection, not for memory.\" Neil Postman wrote about this Socrates' example and said: \"Every culture must negotiate with technol - ogy, whether it does so intelligently or not. A bargain is struck in which technology giveth and technology taketh away.\" The question today is, what has technology such as we - blogs, wikis, podcasts, and online videos given and what has it taken away. This technology is connecting users to knowledge and resources like never be-fore. This grow - ing variety of platforms and the ever expanding online networks of data and content offer endless possibilities, but also pose new challenges. How will these topics play out in terms of journalism? And what does it mean for the training and continuing education of journalists? Second scene: Journalist of leading German magazine is visiting Lju - bljana, the capital of Slovenia. It is December 2007 and Slovenia will in few weeks take over the presidency of Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009syMPosiu M 195 194 Journalistic traininG in c onFlict-relateD situationsthe European Union. There are a number of foreign journalists visiting the country, trying to give their home audiences an impression and information about this post-socialist country and its transformation and transition. The journalist later writes a mixture of analy - sis, comment and feature story. Among the things this journalist comments about Ljubljana is also the follow - ing: (Ljubljana is in Mediterranean mode. Even on these winter days the people of the capital are sitting outside having their coffee.) Now it may be tempting to describe people in Ljubljana and Slovenia as hot-tempered Mediterranean type of folks, so hot-blooded that they don't mind the freezing temperatures and insist on sitting outside, in front of the caf\u00e9s, and drinking their lattes or cappuccinos. However, the reason for this mass of people still sitting outside, although it is December and minus five degrees Celsius, is simpler, more profane, and has nothing to do with the Mediterranean temper: the reason why they drink coffee outside is because smoking is banned inside public places. So, all smokers sit outside, even in the middle of winter. What is the message of this second scene and the article which appeared in that German magazine? The message is that it is true that twitter and Wikipedia and podcasts and weblogs give us more and more information and more and more opinion. They give us quicker informa - tion. Which doesn't mean that everything is solved by that. We still need context. We still need precise, in- depth analysis, the cause and the effect. More importantly, we need not just people who will report and give us the facts, but also people who will give us background and explanation. We need people with expertise and experience who will provide other people, their audience, with precise information, but also interpretation. The information in Ljubljana's case was correct: there are really a lot of people also during the winter who stand or sit outside and drink coffee. However, the reason for this suggested in the article, is incorrect. So today we may have more channels of communica - tion, with more communicators and producers of con - tent than ever before. Millions of people are writing their weblogs, sending their videos to YouTube and other user-generated sites, or twittering and podcast - ing. However, this doesn't mean that the role of well-educated, experienced journalists with in-depth knowl - edge and on-site reporting is unnecessary, unneeded or unwanted. Third scene: A politician/president is holding a press conference. There is a scandal with reports that he was cheating on his wife by having an affair with a younger woman. A journalist immediately at the beginning of the confer - ence asks the question: \"Are you having an affair with that woman?\" Politician looks shocked and angry. \"No! I'm not having an affair with that woman!\" A few weeks later it turns out that the politician was actually cheating on his wife and that he did have an af-fair with the younger woman. Another press conference is held. This time the journalists are angry. The politi - cian was lying to them! They attack him as soon as the conference starts: \"You were lying to us and to our public!\" politician replies: \"No. I didn't continues the journalist, even angrier. \"We asked you if you had an affair with that woman and you said that you never had anything with her!\" \"No,\" continues the politician. \"You asked me: 'Are you having an affair with that woman?' And I totally honestly told you: 'No, I'm not having an affair with that woman.' And I didn't lie. At that moment I was no longer having the affair with that woman. So I didn't lie. You asked me in present tense, not in the past tense, and I told you that at that time I didn't have an affair with her.\" Again the journalists didn't do their job as well as they should have in the first place. They didn't put the ques - tion right. Their question was not precise. And if you don't put a precise question, you don't get a precise answer. And you and your audience don't get the truth. Again, it's important to have a good education, to have a lot of experience and knowledge, to know the tricks, to be able to provide your audience with good and full infor-mation, and good and full background. And here we come to the next stop. We have more channels, more websites and more com - munication technology than ever before. But are we better informed? And, more than that, do we care? Do we care about the society, or is it just about us? Ray Bradbury once wrote in Fahrenheit 451: \"Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capi - tals or how much corn Iowa grew last year. Cram them full of non-combustible data, chock them so damned full of 'facts' they feel stuffed, but absolutely 'brilliant' with information. \"Then they'll feel they're thinking; they'll get a sense of motion without moving. And they'll be happy, because facts of that sort don't change. Don't give them any slip - pery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy. \"Digest-digests, digest-digest-digests. Politics? One column, two sentences, a headline! Then, in midair, all vanishes! Whirl man's mind around about so fast under the pumping hands of publishers, exploiters, broadcast - ers that the centrifuge flings off all unnecessary time-wasting thought!\" I am sometimes concerned that \"man's almost infinite appetite for distractions\" (Huxley) creates trivial \"car - nival culture\" (James B. where we're just \"amusing ourselves to death\" (Neil Postman). Today we should sometimes reconsider whether the truth is not sometimes drowned in a sea of irrelevance. There are hundreds of thousands of blogs and twittering and Friendfeeding, but how many of those deal just with the person writing it and their obsession with them - selves? We could, of course, agree with Oscar Wilde who wrote at the end of the 19th century, \"When people talk to us about others they are usually dull. When they talk to us about themselves they are nearly always interesting.\" And yet we must also not forget that even great individ - ualists as they might be, both Wilde and Socrates, men - tioned at the beginning, used dialogue as their preferred form. We must also not forget that the major Chinese search engine, Baidu, takes its name from an ancient poem about the search for \"a retreating beauty amid chaotic glamour\". In the end we return to the journalists, who should be the professional searchers of this retreating beauty and truth amid chaos. The journalists should, just like Wilde and Socrates, provide a dialogue with their audience, a dialogue where the interests of the audience would lie first and the narcissism of the writer, unlike with many blogs and twittering , would come second or somewhere in the end. As David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, pointed out recently, the blogging and local reporting from Mumbai in the early hours of the November 2008 terrorist attacks were nothing short of remarkable. Ditto in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. But these are extreme cases in extreme circumstances. We need that sort of reporting, information and background every day, for every situation. And we still need educated journalists who have experience with covering different beats, who will go out there and have good background knowledge and know to raise the right questions. In the end, I would like to come back to the main issue of the basic question of this conference, namely conflict prevention in the multimedia era. American writer P. J. O'Rourke once, in the beginning Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009syMPosiu M 197 196 Journalistic traininG in c onFlict-relateD situationsof 1990s, wrote about the war in the former Yugoslavia that this is a war between the Unspellables and Unpro-nounceables. Perhaps if the media and journalist would help to give more background, more knowledgeable coverage of problems such as the Balkans, the audience wouldn't think that this is a war between Unspellables and Unpronounceables, but would actually understand. Everybody knows that there are plenty of problems in today's media and journalism, and that the crisis is deep and strong. However, if there is one task that the media and journalists must continue to perform even in times like these, it is to help stop people from drowning them - selves in a sea of irrelevance. Final scene: Media crisis and crisis of journalism:See the sleeve of album \"Crisis? What Crisis?\" by group Supertramp from 1975: http://www.youtube.com/watc h?v=d0DqVubDUL8&feature=related History of journalism and new ideas ProF. Michael k rzeMinski, lecturer , university of a pplied s ci- ences bonn- rhein- sieg, Germany What is specific about the Internet in comparison to preceding media? First of all, it can be real-time interac - tive. Secondly, it can integrate time-based and non-time based modes of storytelling, previously the domains of either film, radio and television or the print media. Thirdly - and in my view most importantly - the Inter - net is regularly changing its appearance (and its mean - ing), thus constantly re-inventing itself. Whereas the printing press remained more or less the same over centuries and radio and television formed our understanding of \"broadcasting\" at least for some decades, the Internet seems to change every six months, with major \"revolutions\" every two years. Bulletin boards, desktop channels, weblogs, YouTube, Facebook and twitter were the names of this kind of change, branding not only new business models but also marking important changes in people's communication behavior. Because of the continuity of this development over the past 20 years I think it is going to continue for years to come. The real news about the Internet is that it easily adapts itself to new communication forms and needs. All these things imply severe challenges to our tradi - tional understanding of journalism. Will journalists be able to handle the multiple media formats and technolo - gies provided by the Internet? How can they cope with alternative information channels such as we-blogs and citizen journalism? What will be their position in social networks like Facebook and twitter? And finally - who is going to pay for journalists in times of information overflow and gratis offers everywhere? In times of radical uncertainty, it sometimes helps to look at history. The history of journalism reveals some basic principles which have allowed the art to develop and to survive even under changing conditions. Let me mention here only three: Significance: All creatures in - volved in communication wish to tell signal from noise. Unlike in binary thinking, noise is not the absence of a signal, but the lack of difference between many signals. Hence the journalist's voice has always been one signal among others, however the one which could make a difference - you may call it meaning or opinion. In view of this principle social media are by definition no thread to journalism - for the same reason that the invention of the SONY Portapac in the late 1970s did no harm to professional broadcasting. Professionalism: The journalist is not merely a pro - fessional, but in some way what the great sociologist Norbert Elias called a social configuration. His role for civilization is at least as important as that of the medical doctor, the teacher, or the judge. Cultural stud-ies have pinpointed this by referring to the \"Bardic\" tradition of television. Without the professional construction of nar - rative realities, which include both rational and mythical modes of explanation, without the professional story - teller (a resonance provider in terms of systems theory), one can hardly imagine any kind of society. Community: Where there is media, there is community. Journalism, too, is basically directed towards commu - nity building - be it the community of \"well informed citizens\" (Alfred Sch\u00fctz), certain communities of opin - ion or communities of taste. Every reading of the media is accompanied by imaginative co-reading with the eyes of imagined co-readers. This creates the fascination of worldwide live events, be it in concert halls or soccer grounds. In this respect, virtual communities were in existence long before the Internet discovered them. Wherever a special interest magazine could attract certain groups of readers in combination with selected advertisers, virtual communities sharing specific preferences came into life. Only feedback and interaction (e.g. through reader polls) were somewhat slower. The constant re-invention of the Internet will provoke constant re-invention of journalism as well. The pres - ent challenges of journalism, however, even in times of severe economic crisis, in my view can be mastered by not forgetting about the basics of the profession. In order to be significant, modern journalists need to be fully aware of the technical and social possibilities provided by the Internet, and make creative use of it. They must be innovation leaders rather than late adopters of media technologies. In terms of responsibility, it is the original role of jour - nalists to give orientation and to judge on the value of voices heard in the Internet universe. In order to do so, they need to develop special talent and even charisma, apart from good workmanship. Moreover, journalists should not forget about being part of a community with viewers, listeners and readers. Suc - cessful communication depends on stable social relations, which may have to be refreshed from time to time. The special qualifications of journalistic staff, their extraor - dinary competences in comparison to occasional and amateur journalists, should be advertised or at least more offensively communicated (front page rather than hidden in the imprint section). In this view, the present crisis may be just another turn - ing point for something interesting new.Who is a journalist today? aDaM Weatherhea D, project manager c ommonwealth b road - casting association, uk Anyone, anything, anywhere Right now journalism is facing many challenges. Until recent times a journalist could be defined by what he or she wrote, broadcast or photographed and how and by whom their output was disseminated. The journalist 'reported', the broadcaster or publisher 'bought' the material and it was circulated. It was a simple, linear 'chain', from jour - nalist to audience. But as the number of media platforms increases, access to them becomes less restricted and the once simple relationships are altogether more complex. Now anyone can make reports about anything from almost anywhere, they don't have to be paid to do it and their ma - terial can be distributed to global audiences without them needing to be in a financial relationship with a broadcaster or publisher. Crucially, journalists no longer have exclusive access to the mechanisms of widespread production and dissemination of information. So who is a journalist today? What distinguishes a 'journalist' from any individual who wants to report an event and has access to the Internet? The definition of journalist is certainly evolving but can a journalist still be distinguished from those providing what is termed UGC or 'user generated content'? I'd argue that a number of factors mean that a clear distinction can still be made and at the heart of all of those factors lies training and trust. A good journalist Journalist or provider of UGC...both have a common aim - to impart their information to an audience. With the mass of information available to anyone who has TV or Internet access then what enables the audience to choose to read, watch or listen to any particular report or news story? I'd argue that the craft of journalism is still cen - tral to winning and engaging an audience. Being able to write, produce, and tell a story well. Speech, grammar and language are all learned. They have set rules that guide us in creating and interpreting messages. Over many centu - ries journalists have developed skills in how best to impart and share their messages. Audiences today are undoubt - Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009syMPosiu M 199 198 Journalistic traininG in c onFlict-relateD situationsedly media literate. They have learned how to understand and unpick the messages that journalists convey. But a journalist needs to learn and hone those key skills that mean an individual will choose to tune in and engage with their story...to select it from the mass of information available and then stick with it. Another key factor that defines good journalism is an understanding of the law. Not just how to obtain and disseminate information within the law...on occasion all good journalists will need to push the barriers and 'test' the laws of the countries they operate in. Surely that is why good journalism is needed to ensure and promote transparency and good governance. But there are real ad - vantages in knowing what the laws are, before you break them! Connecting individual stories to background trends is also part of the role of a journalist. By putting events into context, they help with our understanding of the world around us. A journalist should seek to distinguish her or his work from other information sources by practicing an ethi - cal code based on accuracy, balance, and transparency. Whereas a blogger can publish and be damned, a journal - ist's role is to guarantee credibility. Journalists will increas - ingly be defined by 'how they do' rather than 'what they do'. A notion of trust is central to what determines who is a journalist and trust relies on building credibility, either as an individual, or collectively as a media organization. A CBA member broadcaster, ABC in Australia, recently had sad cause to illustrate this point. During a time of national trauma in the recent bushfires, audiences tuned into ABC Radio, knowing that it was a trusted source for up-to-date information about the fires. Also, being a professional journalist involves covering topics that aren't of personal interest. It isn't done for fun; it's done because it is a job and jobs have responsibilities. Journalists have big responsibilities. The task of holding our institutions to account shouldn't be left to amateurs. Again this brings us back to training. As journalism evolves with the new media landscape then one new area of training is the key. How to verify what is found on the Internet. Plenty of good stories break on the net...many of them are untrue! Threats to quality journalism Stories of news sources being caught not checking their facts are becoming more and more frequent - as was the case when an Irish student used Wikipedia to attribute a fake quote to recently deceased musician, Maurice Jarre. Despite the quotation being removed from the site by moderators a number of times soon after it was posted, because it had no referenced sources, it was reported worldwide. But the Wikipedia and Wikinews model does have some - thing to contribute to journalism as we are seeing single pages on topics grow as stories evolve. This is clearly evident if you visit the swine flu page on these sites. Another upside is that online news comes with data that has previously been impossible to monitor - news sources now have access to real-time statistics about the popularity of individual stories. But this 'click stream', as it is known, could lure quality sources of journalism towards a more populist style. However, there will, hopefully, also always be a hunger for well researched and well presented information so I don't think lack of demand is a threat to quality journal - ism. The real threat is that high quality journalism doesn't come cheap and the danger in the current climate is that no one is as willing to pay for it. The Internet doesn't produce much first hand news, that's still left to the news - papers and broadcasters, but through Google News and other aggregators anyone can access the best stories from around the world via the Internet. So the current news journalism economic model needs to be reconsidered to ensure that there is enough revenue to pay the best jour - nalists, photographers, editors, and producers. A decrease in spending on newsgathering leads to an increase in pre- packaged PR pieces. It's a conversation Again, in times past, interaction with the public was kept to the letters page. Now most media houses are in the pro -cess of expanding the two-way street that new media has created between news outlets and their users. Journalists will need to get used to the idea that we have entered an era where news is no longer a lecture. It's a conversation. Users are now involved in the reporting and interpretation of news. Journalists have always relied on witnesses to help con - struct the events of a story. Now these witnesses come with photographs and video. They've even been dubbed honorary journalists, citizen journalists. Tapping this resource extends the reach of news outlets, which is a good thing for journalism but it involves creating new guidelines, the development of new professional practices and specific training that will enable journalists to use this material and maintain credibility and trust. Citizen journalism also can involve users sifting through large amounts of data; verify images, as well as suggesting or writing stories themselves. There have been a number of ventures set up on this last basis, including Spot.Us and NowPublic. Spot.Us is a nonprofit project that pioneers \"community funded reporting\". Through Spot.Us the public can com - mission journalists to do investigative reports. Stories can be suggested by anyone and then a journalist pitches to cover it for a certain price. Visitors to the website then donate to fund the pitch. NowPublic is a crowd-sourcing enterprise that utilizes citizen journalists to cover world events. It has been named by Time Magazine as one of the 50 Coolest Web - sites and this year was nominated for an Emmy for Ad - vanced Technology. A question of trust The movement of users from traditional consumer-ori - ented media towards self-produced content shouldn't be viewed in isolation. There is a general societal shift that involves questioning institutional authority. Governments, Big Business and mainstream media are viewed with sus - picion. This has lead people to seek the \"truth\" from other sources. Again, it is a question of trust. The loss of trust in mainstream media is a threat to classic journalism. Citizen syMPosiu M 201 Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2008200 Journalistic traininG in c onFlict-relateD situationsjournalists have the image of being outsiders and under - dogs and they purport to tell it like it actually is. However, they are independent but not responsible. Also, they lack training in ethics and they lack the clout to stand up to large, powerful, and wealthy institutions. Many traditional news sources are embracing the idea of involving users but perhaps none more so than The Guardian newspaper. Media is converging and The Guardian now produces audio and video to complement its online text. The Guardian also has many blogs includ - ing Comment Is Free, which encourages readers to have their say about opinion pieces. During the recent G20 protests in London, The Guardian utilized the latest social media fad, twitter. Four journalists twittered updates throughout the day. I found most of the content boring, but it fulfilled the task of keeping me informed about developments. Crucially, it did this in real time. As Arianna Huffington, founder of The Huffington Post, recently said, \"Consumer habits have changed dramatical - ly. People have gotten used to getting the news they want, when they want it, how they want it, and where they want it. And this change is here to stay.\" So the traditional media have to adopt the new platforms but they must make every effort to retain credibility through training. twitter has been criticized for spreading nonsense about swine flu, scaremongering. In times of cri - sis the public will turn to those they trust for information. This is where traditional media needs to be. Trust will be their unique selling point.Panel 2 The advantage of doing digital best practices in interna - tional media development Living memory - digital audio archiving project in Vietnam Ms nG uyen Pha M hoa b inh, radio t he voice of v ietnam ( vov) Ms heiDrun sPeck Mann, Deutsche 2002 Radio \"The Voice of Vietnam\" (VOV) decided to modernize the audio archive as a natural and logical consequence after the digitization of the production and on-air sites. More than one hundred audio work stations had been installed for digital program production and the computers had been networked for fast access and interchange of program material. Only the audio archive with 30,000 hours of precious recordings such as politi - cal speeches, drama productions, traditional and modern Vietnamese as well as European classical music was still analog. The archive turned into an isolated island, which journalists approached less frequently as they were used to working with one \"click\" instead of leaving the of- fice, going to the other building, searching in a big card index catalogue or some books, borrowing the tapes and playing them back on tape machines which had almost been abandoned by the digital studio environment. Beside the integration of modern workflows, time also became a crucial factor, as some important analog re - cordings had tremendously deteriorated due to the tropi - cal climate and inadequate storage conditions during the war. The oldest recordings date back to 1945. After a training request to DW-AKADEMIE, it was de - cided to set up a long-term consultancy for the planning and implementation of VOV's sound archive. A German expert team advised the Vietnamese colleagues during various consulting modules through six years and helped VOV to train people for the challenge of digitizing the archive. Germany is the world leader in archiving, producing proprietary archiving solutions and possess - ing about 20 years of experience in digital archiving for broadcasters. Developing a digital archive will completely change its role in the broadcasting structure. The store, which in some broadcasting stations to some extent is known as \"death room\" somewhere in a far-off repository in the basement, will turn into the heart of the broadcasting station as a centralized organ, interfacing directly to the journalists' desks, program production and on-air. But many steps have to be taken before that. Decisions have to be made on workflows, meta databas - es, archiving programs, storage media, robot systems, in - formation management, web-based client access and not to forget the installation of tropic-compatible systems. But one of the key questions is: \"Which storage media to choose?\" Looking back at the history of storage media it is obvious that the life span is decreasing the younger the medium is. The quarter inch tape was on the market for more than 50 years, CD is vanishing from the market after 25 years, DAT and MD were interesting for about 10 years and the newer formats like DVD, flash, USB, who knows, will be replaced soon. So strategic planning for the digital archive, mindful of avoiding too high investment costs over the years, allows only a dynamic solution. In the long run we need to save the content, not the carrier. Technical developments have also tremendously de - creased the life span of electronic devices, no one can guarantee how long an audio format resp. the codec will be on the market, therefore the aim must be to store the eternal file in a linear format when archiving. And to be on the safe side for the future, it is advisable to develop a backup strategy which allows the material to be stored with several backup copies on different carriers, in dif- ferent buildings. Beside the \"normal\" audio carriers, which can be played back immediately, there are usually a certain number of critical recordings, which need special care. Physically deteriorated tapes e.g. need to be restored before they can be handled on playback machines. Fungus, oxida - tion, vinegar syndrome, to name some critical degrada - tions, need to be treated. This is a very time-consuming process and a high expert knowledge is necessary to put the carriers back into a playable condition. The risk is high to lose some of the valuable material and after restoration the carrier might be playable only once. Nev - ertheless, the aim always should be to keep the original, even after digitization. But which content should be archived? This is a very difficult decision as the content which today may not yet be important, will be important in future. There is no recipe, each station needs to work out its own selec - tion criteria depending on different factors, such as the station's mission, the workflows, and rights management, and to some extent the hardware capacity. Building up the digital archive takes time which can be used in a productive way. In parallel with the bidding and purchase of the archiving systems, a temporary meta database (e.g. Excel sheet or access database) can be filled with all meta data available from index cards or other sources, which in a later step will be imported into the final system. This method has the big advantage that the meta data have been digitized before the audio digitiza - tion. The identification of each archiving item will be much easier and after digitizing the audio additional meta data of the digitization history can be added easily. VOV has built up a new archive department, where knowledge of maintenance, IT, analog technologies, digital program production, and librarian skills have been gathered. Especially the archiving personnel have to be trained in computer applications, analog and digital audio, meta data enrichment, and restoration. But always keep in mind: the young are digital-born! When it comes to maintaining the analog playback machines, tuning them for archiving purposes, selecting the criti - cal tapes from the shelves, it is the older generations who have the knowledge and experience. This knowledge needs to be transferred to the young employees before the older staff retire. These changes and many more need to be managed and the implementation of the digi - tal archive requires a precise roll-out strategy. Digital audio archiving delivers a lot of advantages: ac - cess via the network to any information in a very short time, no danger of loss or destroying the original mate -202 re-inventinG JournalisM? Journalistic traininG in the social MeDia a Ge syMPosiu M 203 Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009rial, the digitized material can be copied without any quality loss as well as automatically repaired. Yet, the process of developing a digital archive is very complex and not a matter of months but of years. The long-term consultancy ended after six years, the purchase and implementation of the digital archive system was com - pleted after three years, the digitization of the audio carriers will go on for five more years and all recordings will be saved forever! A lot can be done to improve your archiving situation, too, even without a lot of means.Start now to save your cultural heritage! This list might help you to get started: Archive room facilities \u00b7Take all materials from decentralized local deposits and bring them into a central archive. Make sure that the carriers are stored properly (upright position) on shelves. \u00b7Create a clean room for all of your original carriers: no open windows, no moisture and as dust-free as possible. \u00b7Clean the shelves, carrier boxes, but NOT the carri - ers themselves (physical restoration required!). \u00b7The archive room should be equipped with a ther - mometer and a hygrometer. \u00b7 The choice of storage conditions determines the speed of degradation. Keeping tight standards does not prevent degradation. Choose parameters which you can afford and which you can keep 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Important is to have a constant room climate. Keep the temperature and humidity stable (air conditioning: ~20\u00b0C \u00b13%, 40% RH \u00b15%, measurements should be taken in the shelf and not on the wall). \u00b7Install a lock on the door to the archive room and use it every time you leave the room. Improving knowledge of your collectionSort all audio carriers. \u00b7Give each item an identifier (archive number) if this has not yet been done. \u00b7Take inventory (exact statistics about the number and types of carriers in all archive areas). \u00b7Start inputting the main information into an Excel/Access file. \u00b7 Start to take statistics about e.g. the \"most wanted\" material and how many items were lent per month. The information will be helpful to you later, when you have to select the items to be digitized first. Audio equipment \u00b7Collect all playback devices which are not in use (from studios, regional stations, wherever you find them). \u00b7 Maintain them and sort out the best ones. \u00b7 Test them: are they good to use for digitization? Do you have good tape heads? Can you adjust a smooth tape tension? Can they spool with low speed? Do you have mono full-track heads as well as stereo/ two-track heads for these machines? Keep the best machines and spare parts safe in a clean and dry room. Without machines, the audio content on your carriers will be lost forever! Meta data \u00b7All meta data sources (in particular detailed cue sheets) have to be brought to the archive and stored there for future input into a database. \u00b7Create an interim Excel spreadsheet or Access da - tabase or shareware database (multi-user would be ideal) of your card catalogue and other meta data sources. \u00b7Enter all meta data available. \u00b7 Enter cataloguing data for all new archive acquisi - tions into this computerized form. \u00b7Define cataloging rules in order to ensure effective search routines later on. Digitization \u00b7Take care that all audio production workstations are virus-free and keep them virus-free! \u00b7Do not accept USB sticks for use with the archiving computer. \u00b7 Check external audio hard disks for viruses. \u00b7 Use professional soundcards for digitization and in production workstations. \u00b7 Make sure that all digitizations are made from origi - nals (rather than from copies)! 204 re-inventinG JournalisM? Journalistic traininG in the social MeDia a Ge syMPosiu M 205 Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2008 \u00b7 Digitize in a linear format. \u00b7 Set a rule that lending copies are always made from the original WAVE rather than a compressed file ver - sion. \u00b7 Mark all carriers which have been digitized (color- code or stamp). \u00b7 Keep at least two backup WAVE copies of each digi - tal audio production for safety reasons! Training/personnel \u00b7Attention: the young generation is digital-born! Make sure that the expert knowledge on how to maintain analog playback devices or analog carriers will be transferred to young colleagues, before the old generation, who have the best knowledge about the analog material, retires. \u00b7 Train all archivists in the basics of digital audio and audio quality parameters. \u00b7 Train archivists in working with computers, digitiz - ing audio, copying carriers, enriching meta data and all other archive purposes. \u00b7 Search for training modules on librarian skills, how to restore old analog carriers, etc. (sometimes schol - arships are offered). Mission and vision of the Radio Netherlands Training Centre (RNTC) RNTC's activities are ultimately aimed at the role media play in improving the lives of the people in developing countries. Our focus is not on training and consultancy activities as an end in itself, but on outcomes. RNTC believes in participatory approaches, not just in the way we work with our partners and clients but also in the media audiences should be involved and people given a voice. We believe that quality and sustainability can best be achieved if activities are strategically embed - ded in a longer term plan. This means that RNTC fa - vors activities that are spread out over a number of years, rather than one-off activities without any follow-up. RNTC and media Media play an important role in developing societies and countries in transition. RNTC aims to contribute to strengthening this role. RNTC is a network organization, familiar with a variety of forms of partnership as well as a variety of partners. Together we work on enhancing the role of the media in development-related issues like education, participation and diversity, conflict prevention and peace building, promoting human rights and good gover - nance, democracy processes, etc. Consultation and close cooperation with those involved is self-evident if the needs and priorities of local partners and target groups are to be identified correctly and local stakeholders brought on board. The 'client' or partner organization is closely involved in the design, development and implementation of a pro - gram. Against this background, RNTC prefers to work in long-term partnerships with organizations in the field of media, education, and development. Media for development - strengthening African community radioThe \"Initiative for Mobile Training of Community Ra - dio\", or INFORMOTRAC, is an RNTC program that started in 2002 in Guinea Bissau, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. In 2007 INFORMOTRAC was extended to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea Conakry, and Liberia. INFORMOTRAC is made possible with funding by DGIS, the Dutch Directorate-General for International Cooperation. It is part of the program \"Strengthening Media, Empowering People\" that RNTC has developed in partnership with Press Now. INFORMOTRAC's aim is to contribute to poverty reduction by strengthening the capacities of commu - nity radio stations. For this purpose INFORMOTRAC works closely with networks of community radio sta - tions, regional and national authorities, local NGOs, and international development organizations. Mobile training It is not always easy to arrange training courses when one works with a small staff and many volunteers. That is why the trainers of INFORMOTRAC travel to the radio stations. INFORMOTRAC uses a mobile training unit to train people on the spot so that regular broadcasts can remain on air. Each INFORMOTRAC network centre has an up-to- date studio, a team of experienced trainers, and a fully equipped mobile training kit. The centre also produces, together with partner stations and commissioning NGOs, radio programs on issues relevant for the local community. INFORMOTRAC offers the following services: \u00b7Training in journalistic skills like presentation, interviewing \u00b7Technical training in editing, sound, use of equip - ment \u00b7Management training \u00b7Audience research and programming \u00b7Enhancing community involvement \u00b7Technical and logistical support \u00b7Radio program co-productions.

The rapid uptake of mobile phones and their potential for sending and re -ceiving a variety of information is tremendous . According to a recent article in The Africa Report , 60% of people have mobile phones. Here's an excerpt: Hyperbole it is not: there are 4.1 billion mobile phone subscribers worldwide, according to the International Telecommunications Union - which means a phone for every ten people, compared to just 1 billion total subscribers in 2002. Historians will speak of this as the fastest spread of a technology since the wheel, or flint knapping , and Africa is not far off the pace, with one mobile phone for every three people. For individuals and organizations with an interest in communicating widely, with a variety of people, the growing ubiquity of the mobile phone presents exciting opportunities for both receiving and sharing informa - tion. While barely 5% of Zimbabweans have access to the In - ternet or email there are more than two million mobile phone contracts for the country's 11 million people. This represents a penetration rate of roughly 20%. Recogniz - ing these factors, Kubatana began using SMS to com - municate with our members in 2005. We now com - municate with nearly 6,000 subscribers via our regular free text message service - sending out news, event announcements and inspiration, as well as using SMS to solicit feedback from our members about current events and topical issues. At Kubatana we currently rely on Kiwanja's Front - lineSMS to manage text message communications from our members. We regularly use our outgoing message service to ask questions, solicit feedback, or invite mem - bers to share their opinions with us. FrontlineSMS is an integral part of our being able to do more with the re - sponses we receive. It enables us to receive text messages directly into a text file on the computer, which makes it easy to process subscriptions and other feedback. We of- ten share these responses on our community blog, which provides an important arena through which voices of ordinary Zimbabweans and their on-the-ground experi - ence can be amplified.206 re-inventinG JournalisM? Journalistic traininG in the social MeDia a Ge syMPosiu M 207 Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009But even as we appreciate the growing popularity of mobile phones, we recognize the limitations of SMS. Thus Freedom Fone, a new project of Kubatana, lever - ages Interactive Voice Response (IVR) software to make it easier for organizations to share short segment audio programs with their constituencies via the telephone. Freedom Fone's \"leave a message\" facility accesses the two-way communication potential of the telephone. Freedom Fone has important potential as a tool in citi - zen journalism for both content creation and distribu - tion. Innovation and citizen journalism: The Zimbabwean media environment Since 2000 Zimbabwe has experienced a growing politi - cal and economic crisis. This crisis has been coupled with a contraction of the space for popular discussion and debate. Much of Zimbabwe's decline has been widely reported on, and the documents in the archive on the Kubatana web site provide background reading on the crisis. Among other things, Zimbabwe's media environment has been increasingly closed as the political tensions have grown. Independent newspapers have been shut down, and independent journalists routinely face harassment. Repressive legislation such as the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) and the Broad - casting Services Act (BSA) present added challenges to operating any independent media house. Submissions by the Media Monitoring Project of Zimbabwe (MMPZ) to the African Charter on Human and People's Rights session in May 2008 outline many of these obstacles. The June 2008 reports by the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), and International Freedom of Expres - sion Exchange (IFEX) further explore the conditions faced by journalists trying to operate independently in Zimbabwe. Zimbabweans' options for news about their own country and the issues around it are limited to the state media which is widely acknowledged to be laden with bias and propaganda. Government suspicion of independent in - formation initiatives leads the state to label them \"pirate radio stations\" or \"underground newspapers\". There is very limited capacity among civil society organizations to get print information into the hands or homes of ordinary Zimbabweans. There was some hope that Zimbabwe's transitional unity government might open up access to information and communication technology, but the first few months of this government have proved disappointing on this score. Journalists continue to be arrested for spurious reasons and the telecommunications industry has yet to open up as anticipated. Zimbabwe's repressive media environment has made our work in making civic and human rights information available to a wide variety of Zimbabweans all the more important. At Kubatana we value the ways in which new media make it possible for us to reach out to a variety of Zim - babweans. These tools also enable us to access a range of information, verify stories from a variety of sources, and gather different inputs around an issue before we publish anything about it. The use of both new and traditional communication technologies to gather information from a variety of local, ordinary (not necessarily professional or official) sources, and share it widely with the public, is how we define citizen journalism. Freedom Fone and citizen mobile reporting in Zimbabwe As information activists living and working in a dicta - torship, Kubatana realized that it was essential to contin - ue innovating in the area of information dissemination in order to creatively deliver information to members of the general public. Thanks to our innovative use of information technolo - gies and SMS to reach out to Zimbabweans, Kubatana was invited to participate at MobileActive in Toronto in 2005. The event brought a small group of activists and developers together to inspire and inform each other - with a specific focus on mobile telephony products and initiatives. The idea of Freedom Fone was conceived in 208 re-inventinG JournalisM? Journalistic traininG in the social MeDia a Ge syMPosiu M 209 Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2008that creative environment. Our goal became to harness open source telephony platforms and make it easier for activists to independently or collaboratively produce dial-up information to motivate, mobilize and inform their communities - big or small. The idea was basically to simplify and liven up Interac - tive Voice Response (IVR) and use it in a creative way to deliver a variety of information to a variety of people. Freedom Fone takes full advantage of both the afford - ability and increasing popularity of the mobile phone and the telephone's ability to communicate using the richness of voice and audio files. We are excited about the potential of Freedom Fone to provide current, rele- vant news and information to a range of people - with - out the access constraints of email or the Internet. In addition, Freedom Fone opens up potential to commu - nicate much more than one can with the 160 character constraints of SMS. Freedom Fone stores audio files in a Content Manage - ment System (CMS), which is updated through a sim - ple-to-use browser interface. These audio clips populate an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) menu through which callers can navigate for information. IVR menus are the series of prompts and content you encounter when, for example, you phone a large company and an automated voice instructs you to \"Press 1 for sales, 2 for the help desk, 3 for customer care\" and so forth. Individuals can contribute questions, content, and feedback by leaving voice messages via the IVR inter - face. Users can phone in from a landline, mobile, or soft phone (like Skype), and Freedom Fone can connect to mobile phone SIM cards, land lines, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) numbers. This technology can be used in a 'cost free to caller' con - text - where users could dial a toll-free number to access the service - or leave a missed call, effectively \"tickling\" a number that records the user's phone number and calls them back, connecting the user to the IVR menu content. In a 'low cost to caller' context users can SMS in for a call back. Or one person can send a text message which requests a call back to another person's number.An early version of Freedom Fone has allowed us to start experimenting locally with a dial-up information service in Zimbabwe. Constraints are many - mobile network services over time have shifted from previously being af- fordable but over-congested to now being expensive and less accessible to the poor. In spite of these limitations more people can afford access to information via phones than computers, so we will persist with our information outreach using our new tool. Recently we opened up Kubatana's call-in lines and test - ed the \"leave a message\" facility with callers applying to be our DJ. We had more than 100 people phone in with their auditions, and interviewed our short-listed appli - cants in mid-May. Our content will include the mix of news, inspiration, activism, events, jobs, and opportuni - ties that members have come to value from our website, community blog, email, and SMS service, but will target those Zimbabweans who cannot access our information in other formats. We will use the leave a message facil - ity to take caller contributions, feedback, and questions, and also to receive tip-offs, citizen reports and on-the- ground accounts of events across the country. Uses of Freedom Fone beyond Zimbabwe Even in less repressive contexts than Zimbabwe, there are still many people at the margins of society, and it is important that individuals and organizations use the full range of tools available to communicate with the public. We are excited about the global opportunities for Free - dom Fone to equalize access to life-enhancing informa - tion. Freedom Fone is set up so that information in the sys - tem can be updated continuously and made available to callers 24 hours a day, overcoming the hurdles of access, literacy, printing, distribution, and time delays which print-based initiatives often encounter. The simplicity of the user interface, the open nature of telecommunica - tions and the low equipment requirements of the system make it a more affordable and accessible option than starting a radio station or buying an hour of radio time each week to communicate an organization's message.We are excited about other ways in which Freedom Fone could integrate with existing technologies and initiatives in citizen reporting. Ushahidi is one such initiative. Concerned about the 2007-8 post-election violence in Kenya, and the shut - down of local media that went with it, Kenyan blog - gers and software developers worked together to form Ushahidi (which means \"testimony\" in Swahili). They worked with blog aggregator Mashada, which had set up an SMS and voice hotline for people to report on their experiences, and what they saw in their communi - ties. Ushahidi created a mashup with Google Earth on a website where people could see the reports of vio - lence mapped across the country . Ushahidi verified the reports and gave a credibility rating to each incident on the map. They also mapped incidents reported in the international press such as the BBC. This combination of information from both crowd-sourced and mainstream information channels, and Ushahidi's commitment to verifying and rating reports, gave their maps important credibility. Ushahidi is widely referenced as a power - ful example of the importance and potential of citizen journalism, particularly in crisis scenarios . Since then Ushahidi has begun developing open source instances of their software to enable organizations and community groups to take on similar initiatives in their own areas and around their own issues. Our develop - ment teams are discussing ways in which Freedom Fone might add functionality to Ushahidi's platform. Maps can have a powerful effect on their viewers because of the immediate, visual way in which they display infor - mation. Similarly, being able to receive and share audio reports from citizen reporters in the field during a time of crisis would provide an immediate, grounded picture from people directly experiencing this crisis - be it vio - lence, a natural disaster, or a disease outbreak. Sahana is another open source initiative mobilizing IT for emergencies. Freedom Fone developers are also in touch with their technical team. Initiated by volunteers in Sri Lanka after the Asian tsunami in December 2004, Sahana provides a suite of open source web-based di - saster management applications that organizations can customize to use for communication, data collection and networking in a humanitarian emergency. They are constantly developing their tools, and are working on an SMS module for communication . The ability to integrate voice through Freedom Fone would further enhance their product. Organizations could record and regularly update their own content, for example answers to Frequently Asked Questions, where people can go for help, or even provide a service to help family members locate one another after an emergency. Callers could leave messages describing things in their areas, asking for specific assistance, or sharing words of support and comfort for one another. Whilst reports received over the phone might not be of the same audio quality as a studio recording, news agen - cies have already recognized the usefulness of telephone interviews and reporting, and regularly use them in their broadcasts. Freedom Fone puts the power of audio information in the hands of the public, bringing citizen journalism to life through the authenticity of individu - als' voices - and the context provided by background noise, music, conversation, and other sounds. Increasingly, citizen journalism is providing an essential outlet for a variety of information, and is breaking down the barriers and implied hierarchy of \"journalist\" and \"audience\". Even as the general public regularly turns to mainstream media houses for information about the world around them, these mainstream media houses are also turning to citizen reporters for the information they then share with a wider audience. For example, the formal international media presence was very small in Madagascar when a coup took place there in March 2009. So observers around the world turned to the blogosphere, where groups like Foko and its community blog proved one of the key sources of up-to-date information about the coup . Meanwhile, Foko partnered with Ushahidi to collect and map citizen reports during this crisis. Foko Ushahidi's main objec - tive is \"to find real facts, and to distinguish rumors from truth \". In another example, Al Jazeera recently ran their instance of Ushahidi on the War on Gaza site . This is an important case of a mainstream media house recognizing 210 re-inventinG JournalisM? Journalistic traininG in the social MeDia a Ge syMPosiu M 211 Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009the immediacy and relevance of local citizen voices and crowd-sourced information, and integrating it directly with their news coverage. Should Freedom Fone inte - grate with Ushahidi, organizations like Foko and even news services like Al Jazeera which adapt Ushahidi for their own purposes will benefit from being able to work with voice reports and mobile phone broadcasting as well as SMS and web-based data collection for always- up information sharing. Challenges and opportunities of citizen journal - ism Of course, the broadened access to communication tools has its dangers. The ability to self-publish or mass-disseminate information means individuals and organizations can bypass traditional forms of editing and cross-checking. But if they do so repeatedly, recipients will lose faith in their information and the publisher will become less credible. The freedom of citizen journalism comes with certain responsibilities. Among other things, citizen journalism is proving that fact checking and responsibility are not the sole purview of large media houses. Increasingly, smaller initiatives take on independent reporting and the concomitant requirements for adequate sourcing, cita - tions and accuracy. And, as discussed above, Internet- published citizen reporting is allowing the mainstream media to access eyewitness reports and breaking news from parts of the world which were previously much more difficult to access. Conclusion We anticipate and imagine a variety of other applica - tions of Freedom Fone as the software matures and more organizations take it up. Desktop publishing tools made it easier for organizations to publish their own newsletters and magazines, and Web 2.0 tools have made it easier for anyone to write a blog, or create an online community presence. We hope Freedom Fone will similarly remove the technical and cost barriers that surround audio content creation and dissemination, providing another tool to be used in citizen journalism. Panel 3 Does journalism training make sense? And if yes, when and why? Multi- media and conflict prevention: Some African experi - ences ProF. Guy b erGer, head of s chool of Journalism and Media studies, rhoDes u niversity, s outh a frica In April 2009 it was reported that the Media Council of Kenya (MCK) had called on that country's Ministry of Communication to regulate journalism education and training. The proposal was that institutions engaged in such activities would be required to employ certified and accredited lecturers and have a minimum set of training facilities before being allowed to operate. Three excep - tions (all of which have representatives on the MCK) were named as the Nairobi University School of Jour - nalism, Daystar University and the Kenya Institute of Mass Communication. (The first two have been recog - nized in a 2007 UNESCO survey of potential centers of excellence or of reference - see UNESCO, 2007.) Kenya's journalism schools exist at registered universi - ties, both public and private, but there are also private colleges that offer journalism training. Public universi - ties have the autonomy to mount programs, but private universities have to secure approval from the Commis - sion for Higher Education, which then constitutes ac - creditation of that program. The private colleges appear to be unregulated. The background to this call for greater regulation of journalism schools was reportedly complaints being made by media players that most training institutions were offering sub-standard courses and \"flooding\" the industry with \"half-baked professionals\", in the words of one report. \"The situation is so serious that people are graduating with diplomas in film production and they cannot even switch on a camera,\" Esther Kamweru, the chairperson of the MCK, is quoted as saying. She is also on record for saying that the Kenyan media were concerned about the infiltration of the profession by non-trained journalists. \"We have received a lot of com - plaints from the professional journalists who are raising concern about the issue and it is something we are trying to look at as a council to better address it,\" she report - edly said. Indeed, the Journalist Association of Kenya (JAK) has called on government to \"to tighten journal - ism training\". The news report on the MCK's specific proposal added that, to ensure compliance with the new directive if approved, the MCK was mobilizing human resource departments in media houses to reject graduates from non-accredited institutions. The article concluded by citing Eric Odour of the JAK as saying: \"The move by the Media Council of Kenya is a boost to freedom of the media, which is anchored on professional training of journalists.\" These steps contrast with other developments in Kenya that are relevant to journalism education and training. Reference here is made to the aftermath of the wide - spread violence in that country following the election in 2007. That development challenged journalism teach - ers to help address a situation in which certain media (especially private radio stations) were revealed as hav - ing helped to fan the flames of the inter-ethnic clashes. \"We live in a region of conflict, but we never thought it would happen in our own country,\" said a still-shocked representative of the Nairobi University School of Journalism at a meeting of African journalism educators in March 2008, going on thereafter to talk about the need to reform the school's curriculum so as to address media and conflict issues. A second area that challenged journalism schools and teachers was the role of Kenyan government during the crisis in questionable restrictions on media freedom (a ban on live broadcasting). This is not to say that focusing on \"accreditation\" issues in journalism education and training in Kenya necessar - ily underplays the issues of what to do about conflict and media freedom. Rather it is to signal that regulation and restriction is at least one of the issues around \"profession - alization\" that is being emphasized by MCK and others. But whether restriction on education and training provi - sion at all (even if seen as a means to address conflict and media freedom) is desirable is open to question. To assess this, it is necessary to look at media politics within Kenya. In search of a role The MCK is a body born in controversy. It replaced a previous institution that had been based on voluntary self-regulation and which had been chaired by Absolom Mutere, a journalism lecturer. The momentum for this change came from government which introduced draft legislation for a statutory council, which would represent a range of media stakeholders - but with government in control (for example by appointing the chairperson). Kenyan journalists expressed fear at the time that current or future governments might use the proposed law to intimidate them or deny them freedom to operate. The Kenya Media Owners Association called upon parlia - ment to get rid of the bill. After negotiations and some limited reform of the law, however, it was passed in 2007 and the MCK came into existence. Its membership is predominantly from vari - ous media sector bodies (e.g. owners, editors, journal - ists, trainers), who now elect the Chair from amongst their ranks. The bodies mandated to nominate members of the council are the Kenya Union of Journalists (2), Media Owners Association (3), Law Society of Kenya (1), the Editors Guild (1), the Kenya Correspondents As - sociation (10), the Public Relations Society of Kenya (1), schools of journalism (2), Kenya Institute of Mass Com - munication (1), and the Kenya News Agency (1). There is no provision for media support NGOs or citizen groups. Freelances could be considered to be represented at least in part by the Kenya Correspondents Association. (It is estimated that freelance journalists form the major - ity - 75 to 80 percent - of the profession in Kenya, MSI, 2007.) The Media Council Act has provisions that speak of media freedom and independence, but it also provides for a compulsory licensing mechanism for journalists and an annual prescribed fee. While government initially indicated it would fund the council, the Media Owners Association believed this could compromise indepen - dence - hence the fee mechanism. Given the controversy 212 re-inventinG JournalisM? Journalistic traininG in the social MeDia a Ge syMPosiu M 213 Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2008around the fee (see below) a bill was debated in parlia - ment which would provide for government funding, but no resolution was reached. The council is also empow - ered to \"uphold and maintain the ethics and discipline of journalists\". It has substantial legal powers to compel the publication of apologies in print or broadcast. The law further allows it, in effect, to deny accreditation, and to implement de-accreditation (aka deregistration). Heavy sanctions may be imposed on journalists found guilty of failure to comply with the Council's Complaints Com - mission, or for misleading or obstructing this Commis - sion: imprisonment for up to three months and/or a fine ranging from 100,000 to 200,000 Kenyan shillings (circa $1,500 to $3,000) on journalists. The functions and duties of MCK's executive director include keeping \"registers of journalists, media enter - prises and other registers\". Indeed, journalists in the country nowadays have to register for accreditation with the MCK. A letter from the council sent to all media owners, expanding on the law, said journalists have to seek accreditation on an annual basis. In fact, the law does not go as far as this, specifying only that fees may be annual. Section 19 (1) says that \"The Council may, by notice in the Gazette, impose a levy in respect of all media enterprises operating in Kenya, and an annual registration fee in respect of all journalists whose names appear in the registers kept by the Council\". There are two aspects of controversy around this ac - creditation/registration. Firstly, it has been argued that \"nurses, engineers and lawyers are accepted into practice once\"; \"why should we renew accreditation as if it is membership to a club or a professional body?\" journalist activist Elias Mbau has been quoted as saying. Secondly, there has been uproar about the costs of registration. In 2008, the MCK set the fee at 2,000 Kenyan Shillings ($30) for each journalist, giving them two months to comply or face deregistration. Eric Orina, secretary gen - eral of the Kenya Union of Journalists (KUJ), responded somewhat cryptically: \"Self-regulation is the spirit of the laws and while we support accreditation of journal - ists we cannot allow the government through the Media Council to decide who practices journalism and who does not.\" His sentiments were reported to be echoed by Martin Gitau, Chair of JAK. More than one commenta - tor, however, said that the unions feared that journalists having to choose between paying their subscription dues and the registration levy would pay the former - thereby weakening the unions. This was not the view of one particular former KUJ of- ficial. Back in 2004, the then KUJ secretary-general Eze - kiel Mutua was reported as being at the forefront of the campaign for self-regulation. In November that year, he said: \"The Kenya Union of Journalists will not like to see the reintroduction of punitive and restrictive legislations that will make it impossible for journalists to freely oper - ate in the course of discharging their duties.\" However, by October 2007 he had become the Director of Infor - mation and Communication in government and in 2008 was on record as saying that journalists had to comply with the registration requirement in the interests of pro - moting professionalism in the sector. He did, however, warn the MCK against charging levies that the journal - ists could not afford. Ultimately, the dispute around the levy was settled at Ksh 2,000 ($30), and a number of the media houses have paid up for their journalists. Evident in all this are not the principle of statutory registration/accreditation being contested, but rather the annual renewal and the quantum of its implementation. Two other journalist bodies, the KUJ and the Kenya Journalists Association (KEJA), observed that the MCK was raising funds for its own existence without specify - ing what these would be spent on that would benefit journalists. Journalists' bodies had earlier suggested fi - nancing the council by a one percent levy on advertising revenue. Interestingly, although the MCK is chaired by a member of the Media Owners Association, it fixed the levy for media houses at 2,000 Kenyan Shillings ($30) per month with some variation, however, in accordance with the size of the company. Nevertheless, the amounts were reportedly being challenged by some owners. However, in defense of the levies, the Chair of the coun - cil, Wachira Waruru stated: \"We are a product of nego - tiation between the media and the government and since we have a legal mandate we have to implement it.\" In other words, it appears that industry stakeholders are required to fund the government's desire for statutory regulation, thereby not only policing themselves at the behest of the state, but carrying the costs as well. This could open the MCK in effect to doing the govern - ment's work for it. In August 2008 a meeting was con - vened to discuss the possibility of reviewing the Media Act to allow the Media Council to be funded by the government - a move that could further compromise the independence of the body. As indicated above, a bill to amend the Act was debated in parliament in May 2009, although without resolution at the time of writing. However, the MCK has also had some tensions with government. The body is reported to be legally prohib - ited from obtaining donor funds, but government has questioned where the funding has come from in regard to an MCK plan to audit media performance during the election violence. The ex-journalist, now Director of Information and Communication, Ezekiel Mutua, charged that the MCK was meddling in the affairs of his ministry which had planned a similar audit. Mutua, who sits on the council, threatened to disband the body. \"If the MCK cannot work in tandem with its parent ministry (sic), then, as the director of information and public communication and its appointive authority, I will have compelling reason to deregister the Waruru team and appoint a team that will cultivate a much more professional, lawful and symbolic relationship with the ministry,\" said Mutua. It thus appeared that a body set up to register and deregister who could be a journalist was itself in danger of its incumbents themselves being \"deregistered\" from its offices. It is said that Mutua later released a statement toning down this hardliner stance. Another area, in which MCK has also come into conflict with the government, revealing some disillusion by the authorities as regards their own initiative, is in regard to a new law passed in December 2008. This Communica - tions (Amendment) Act intrudes even further into media freedom than the 2007 legislation which gave rise to the MCK. The new law failed to amend the relevant part of legislation dating back to 1998 that allowed for raids on media houses. Further, it marginalized the MCK in terms of content regulation in favor of the purely gov - ernmental body, the Communications Commission of Kenya. This law was taken through parliament by the Minister of Information and Communication - former 214 re-inventinG JournalisM? Journalistic traininG in the social MeDia a Ge syMPosiu M 215 Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009journalism educator, Samuel Poghisio. After enormous protests, the Kenyan president has agreed to return the law to parliament for further amendment. However, even without it, the MCK as it stands appears to be an instrument that - while it may not be a direct tool of government - could serve to severely restrict individual free speech and even media freedom in Kenya. Sifting the significances This short story highlights a number of challenging is - sues in African media, and not only about former jour - nalists and journalism educators like Mutua and Poghisio who become controlling forces of media. The stated intention of setting up the MCK is to pro - mote \"professionalization\" - an objective that like \"ac - creditation\" can mean many things. At any rate, \"pro - fessionalization\" is prominently highlighted by a great many stakeholders seeking to optimize the democratic significance of media. Amongst these are: \u00b7the 'Africa Media Development Initiative' - co-coor - dinated by the BBC World Service Trust (2007); \u00b7the Media Sustainability Index of the International Research and Exchange Center (2006); \u00b7 the US-based Center for National Media Assistance (2007); \u00b7 UNESCO's indicators for media development (2008). Evidence of the lack of professional journalism around Africa has also been detailed by African scholars such as (the late) Francis Kasoma and Francis Nyamnjoh. They have noted bribery, fabrication, sensationalism, donor- driven agendas, etc. According to MSI (2008), in Kenya \"many journalists ask for transport from organizers of events. Editors ask for money to kill stories or give more coverage to certain people, institutions, or businesses. Self-censorship is practiced at all levels. Negative stories on big advertisers are not run in order to protect rev - enue.\" A conference in Burkina Faso in 2008, convened by the European Union (EU) and the African Union (AU), heard President Blaise Compaor\u00e9 complain about \"de - formation, libelous or insufficiently documented reports, amateurism, and corruption\". (The same speaker was si - lent about abuses against journalists - indeed, the killers of independent Burkinabe journalist Norbert Zongo in 1998 have yet to be brought to book by the Compaor\u00e9 government.) Against this backdrop, the conference controversially resolved to create a Pan-African Media Observatory to \"ensure responsibility, quality, profes - sionalism and ethical principles at continental level...\" (see Berger, 2009). Significantly, such criticisms by the above-named about a lack of professionalism are typically leveled against the private press, with little or nothing being said about the situation in government-controlled media. However, across Africa there are scores of state-owned broadcast - ers, newspapers, and news agencies which practice pro - pagandistic mass communication that is, to put it mildly, rather far from professionalism in the sense of indepen - dent journalistic professionalism. It is probably only to be expected that dominant political forces only see a lack of professionalism in that part of the media which they do not control. But even if even- handedness was in operation, and the question of pro - fessionalism assessed across the entire media spectrum, there is still another issue that arises. This is the questioning of professionalism as a form of gate keeping and control that is anathema to democracy. It is thus an issue about the extent to which profes - sionalism serves as a barrier to free speech, and a block to entry into journalism. This applies to those who are entitled access to mass communication platforms, and affects making a livelihood from media industry as an institution for the right of expression. And particularly the community radio movement, not least in Africa, is concerned about the privileging and elitism associated with \"professionalism\". Further, as blogging develops in African countries, so too do proponents of citizen jour - nalism also clash with this kind of professionalization. These issues become particularly relevant in the Ke - nyan example, where the MCK model becomes a very slippery slope to control. There are indeed many fly-by-night Kenyan institutions with bogus qualifica -tions which take the fees of many aspirant journalists and which annoy the media industry with the quality of their graduates. However, the MCK measure goes as far as seeking not only accrediting colleges, but also journalism teachers. In this, it echoes a proposed trend in neighboring Tanzania. The logic in this is the com - pulsory licensing of the entire chain of human resources for journalism: colleges, trainers, journalists, and media houses. How media freedom and independence are to be reconciled with such a sewn-up system is hard to perceive. That the registration of journalists may rapidly become the licensing of free speech is evident in the Tanzanian proposals. In that country, in March 2007 the govern - ment published the draft Media Services Bill whereby all journalists would be required to hold a recognized professional or academic qualification and be licensed by a central body, the Media Standards Board, that is ap - pointed by government. The bill (still not passed by May 2009 - although a similar law was passed in Botswana in 2009) says: \"No person shall practice journalism in Tanzania unless he/she holds academic and professional qualifications recognized by the Board.\" These qualifi - cations are defined as a university degree, a postgraduate diploma in journalism or mass communication, or other qualification to be approved by the Board. It is an of-fence to hire a non-qualified person to practise journal - ism in terms of the Tanzanian bill. At present the Kenyan media still hire as they please. But, ominously, the MCK has amongst its legal func - tions that of making \"recommendations on the employ - ment criteria for journalists\". Going by the experience of seeking to accredit journalism schools in Kenya, the \"recommendations\" here are in the hands of the govern - ment. What you have in these situations is, at \"worst\", a won - derful apparatus that could be abused for political sup - pression of critical public speech. At \"best\" it could be a cartel that has come together to create a closed shop around who can practice journalism - and with an ex - pulsion mechanism to compel conformity. Yet even this latter situation would be contrary to important prin - ciples and standards: \u00b7The Inter-American Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression (2000) says that any com - pulsory membership or qualification to practice as a journalist amounts to an illegitimate restriction on every person's right to freedom of expression through \"any medium\". The same sentiment is expressed in a 2003 joint declaration by the relevant rapporteurs of the UN, the Organization for Secu - rity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the Organization of American States in 2003. \u00b7 The African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, in its 2002 \"Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa\" says: \"Everyone shall have an equal opportunity to exercise the right to freedom of expression.\" It also provides that there should not be any undue legal restrictions on the exercise of an individual's rights as a media practitio - ner. \u00b7Kenya's own constitution states (Section 79 (1)): \"Except with own consent, no person shall be hin - dered in the enjoyment of his freedom of expression, that is to say freedom to hold opinions without inter - ference, freedom to receive ideas and information without interference and freedom from interference with his correspondence.\" The repercussions of statutory licensing affects not only individual journalists, but journalism schools and jour - nalism teachers are also potentially affected. The system creates a chilling effect - which is one reason why gov - ernments come to expect that formal qualifications for journalists will help guarantee a quiescent press. However, there may well be times and reasons why journalism training should be free to chart its own course. This includes being free to criticize govern - ment or the industry - because of ethical lapses in both, or because of industry inertia and lag in terms of new paradigms, topics, and technologies of journalism. If a journalism school and its personnel meet the approval of state and industry, and if their stamp is what entitles a person to work as a journalist, then an authoritarian situation is in place. That set up is very vulnerable to tyranny against individual free speech.216 re-inventinG JournalisM? Journalistic traininG in the social MeDia a Ge syMPosiu M 217 Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2008To sum up: if we were to identify a dominant factor of influence in education and training as a \"professionaliza - tion project\" in at least two African countries, then we can point to the politics of vested interests in media and leading educational institutions working purely in their own interests, in a way that provides an excellent chan - nel for government designs on the media. These politics may render the education and training projects success - ful in terms of political control. But it is highly negative from the point of view of contributing to a free and independent media. Looking ahead The 2007 UNESCO study of African journalism schools was driven by the question of how, in effect, to improve their institutional capacity as \"professionalization proj - ects\". Part of this agenda was the issue of standards of excellence, and systems for measuring this. Some debate has taken place as to whether this could be assisted by a pan-African system of accreditation (UNESCO 2007). What the Kenyan case shows are the grave dangers of an approach that entails statutory power, located within a context of a predatory government co-opting media owners, and some unions and journalism schools into would-be professional cartels. On the other hand, what could an alternative system look like? The point of reference that should be the starting point are the criteria for quality journalism in any society. Such journalism, taken as a whole, should be independent of particular vested interests rather than subservient to a single set. It should be accurate, rep - resentative, and compelling. In addition, it needs to be relevant - for example educational, gender-sensitive, etc. - with particular inflections as regards a given society's conditions (e.g. conflict, HIV, environment). It would be extreme to attribute performance short - falls in regard to these criteria to the state of journalism education and training in a given society. There are numerous other variables that play a part - from the individual character of journalists and their educational background, through to their media houses and the busi - ness models therein, reporter-source relationships, and, of course, government controls. In Kenya's case, where much journalism is supplied by untrained freelancers, and where the \"hate speech\" cases post-elections were more associated with DJs and talk show hosts than jour - nalists, it is rather hard to blame a lack of professionalism on the journalism schools. To the extent that what happens in education and train - ing has a bearing on the practice and institutions of journalism, the challenge is how to promote excellence without sliding into regulation, licensing or \"clubby\" protectionism. In the Kenyan case, what can be done in the face of fly-by-night schools? The answer here is: Instead of trying to ban them, the answer surely is to compete - and also for the media industries to alert the public as to which schools and programs produce the graduates they will employ. Indeed, all media training institutions in Kenya have in recent years had to face the fact of the giant Nation media group setting up its own academy, effectively expressing a vote of no confidence in all the journalism schools as suitable external suppliers of graduates or skills training for working journalists. Ultimately, what is needed is for training institutions to look closely at the criteria for excellence which were collectively developed during the UNESCO study of African journalism schools. These criteria focus on the means, not the outcomes, and they cover three bases - many of which are underdeveloped amongst the schools. The first base is the internal capacity of a school - which covers infrastructure, curriculum, qualifications, and ex - perience of teachers, opportunities for media production. The second is the external orientation and interconnec - tion of a school. Here, ties with industry (not necessarily uncritical) are important, such as internships, and train - ing across the divide. In Kenya, providing services to freelances and radio talk show hosts would be relevant examples. In addition, links with community and stance as regards media policy and freedom (including the free - dom of community media journalists and bloggers!) are important. Lastly, the forward orientation of journalism schools is a factor that impacts on their ability to make a difference to journalism. This relates to the sustainability of a school - its revenue sources, its planning ability, its networks, and its standing. Working on building in all three areas is a far more effective way than seeking results through regulation. If progress in these areas is to require some stamp of approval, let it avoid an exclusionary and state-based process (even when industry is involved in it), and rather operate with a voluntary peer-based mechanism. A successful (albeit resource-hungry) case to look at is the USA's experience of voluntary accreditation by the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (ACEJMC) (see Berger, 2005). If self- and peer-based voluntary \"accreditation\" is in place as the dominant factor of influence, then education and training as a \"professionalization project\" can be success - ful in terms of affirming a progressive interpretation of journalism and a conducive environment for the media. But if politics prevail, a perverted professionalization will result that is a far cry from the kind of practice which promotes excellence, as defined by the features of a free and independent journalism.

Panel 4 Social media journalism Crowd-sourcing your stories: The Unsung Peace Heroes in Kenya eMer b eaMer, research and development director of b utterfly Works social design agency, t he n etherlands \"It is good to hear from you. It is quite a long time with - out putting an eye on you, but it is on to my greatest and innermost trust that you are alive and just kicking this ball of life. My time has been good and I am still in the midst of hope that all gonna be well. It is yet another day, month and year the good Lord has given unto us.\" This is an excerpt from an email written by Alfred Sakwa Sabatia, 23 years, from Nairobi and a winner of the Unsung Peace Heroes prize held in Kenya in 2009. He goes on to tell that he has recorded three new peace songs on CD for distribution and set up a youth peace group in his slum area. He wrote this in response to our asking what he had done with the prize money - which he was free to spend - and how he was doing. Before I tell you more about Alfred Sakwa and how his story has travelled, let me describe the Unsung Peace Heroes campaign, how it worked, what media we used, and what we hoped to achieve. The campaign held at the end of 2008, running into 2009, was a response to the post-election violence which ripped through the societal fabric of Kenya in 2008. The 'Unsung Peace Heroes' campaign called on the Kenyan public via newspapers, radio, sms, web and flyers 218 re-inventinG JournalisM? Journalistic traininG in the social MeDia a Ge syMPosiu M 219 Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009to nominate anyone that they felt was worthy of be - ing called a peace hero during that violence. It could be someone who had given safety to people from another tribe, ran a peace march, wrote peace graffiti on slum walls, or indeed dissuaded angry young mobs from their route to violence. Nominations poured in mainly via sms, with stories of wonderful bravery and kindhearted - ness by people all over the country who had taken the effort, sometimes huge, to help their compatriots at a time when the news of burnings, rioting, shootings, and killings was on TV news across the world. These were exactly the type of stories we knew existed and wanted to capture, reward, and spread. Alfred Sakwa Sabatia, winner of Unsung Peace Heroes Award Kenya 2009 All the stories were plotted on a Google map web using the now well known platform 'Ushahidi', for everyone in the diaspora and blogosphere to see. The Ushahidi platform for crisis mapping was conceived and built dur - ing the post-election violence in Kenya in an attempt to cover the quickly unfolding drama, faster than the news people could follow everywhere. This platform has since grown phenomenally and has been used in other (post) conflict areas but is in fact applicable for crowd reporting on any rapid and widespread event, as has been seen with its use for plotting the spread of swine flu, and reports on voting irregularities in the recent Indian election. In our case we wanted to collect and map the positive stories of peace efforts a year after the violence. The best stories (which were verified by calling and in - terviews) were put forward to a professional Kenyan jury representing civil society to choose eight winners. The winners received a money prize and their stories and photos were published, on the website of course, but also printed full page in The Nation national newspaper. We wanted to put the spotlight on those who contrib - uted to peace, and get the stories out of the people who had done just that; the slogan adopted by the jury was 'Peace Pays' and to that intention they fundraised for more money in order to up the original prize money of 10,000 shillings to 30,000. That is the equivalent of 300 euros. The combination of media we used was to ensure that we would reach all types of people and lifestyles in Ke - nya. Unlike the West where most people use all media but at different times and occasions, and for different types of information and communication, in Kenya dif- ferent groups of people have access to different types of media. Thus in order to reach as many people as possible with our call for nominations we utilized all channels except TV (it being too expensive). Facebook is very popular amongst young Kenyans so we started a viral there, too. So how does this case relate to the broader discussion regarding the future of classical journalism in the age of social media, and what lessons could we learn for wider application? Without being presumptuous (as a non- journalist) I would like to proffer a few points we can maybe take from this case. To begin, the various media are complementary, espe - cially in the case of emerging markets where different groups have access to different media and different types of stories fit different media formats. To be more specif- ic, without sms we would not have been able to run this campaign, sms above web was the easiest way for our target group to contact us, it is also cheaper than call - ing. On the other hand the best way to get the story out about the winners in Kenya was to use the newspaper. The newspapers are not free and are widely read there. The best way to reach a worldwide audience was the website supplemented by blog posts. We had 4,000 hits a day on the site for a few months. Secondly, there is no need to allow the quality or truth levels to suffer from incorporating social media in your approach. While every nomination and story we received was accepted at face value and loaded to the map, all the potential winners and final selection were interviewed and verified to ensure the integrity of their stories. And foremost is that using social media offers the pos - sibility to create an enrichment of available stories and perspectives from which journalists can source and inform themselves. By leveraging the motivation of the crowd, you gain access to live, multi-facetted, distrib - uted location stories. The possibility to source stories from every possible corner of the world, from the people themselves, is in my mind a huge step forward. Back to Alfred Sakwa. Since his story was published in the national newspaper he has had strangers com - ing up to him on the street and congratulating him and thanking him for his efforts; he has, as described above, intensified his efforts to create a culture of peace. On the media front, the story was picked up by all the other main newspapers, and he and his fellow winners were written up. Just recently two TV possibilities have come in, the first involves a Kenyan TV series that travels the country showcasing encouraging stories, and a TV chan - nel in the Netherlands is researching his story for cover - age later this year. To close with Alfred's words, \"Let's keep the fire burn - ing in us. Yours for peace, Alfred\".The Unsung Peace Heroes campaign was conceived and executed by Butterfly Works social design agency and Media Focus on Africa, with help from NairoBits, de - sign school Kenya and the Ushahidi team, and of course the Kenyan crowds.

Enabling discussions Journalism 1.0 prints a finished story or puts a finished story on the web. The readers may then - sometimes, but not always - comment on the story. The author or an editor is not actively present except to delete inap - 220 re-inventinG JournalisM? Journalistic traininG in the social MeDia a Ge syMPosiu M 221 Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2008propriate comments. Journalism 2.0 is different. A story isn't \"finished\" once it's been published. Authors need to join the discussion. Comments by users need to become an equally recognized part of the story development process. Comments need to be free from their traditional ghettos and be placed prominently. Blogs, which have always been more open in allowing discussion, can be a role model in this process. Example: The Globe and Mail in Toronto, Canada, is moving in this direction by adding more and more com - munity features. Communities Editor Mathew Ingram announced: \"Over the next few weeks and months, we will be add - ing new community features as well, including forums and groups, which will allow you to have a focused discussion around a specific issue, rather than having to do that through comments on a particular news story. In some cases, we may close comments on a story but open a forum where readers can discuss a contentious issue in a more closely moderated environment. \"I am also working hard to convince our writers of the benefits of responding to comments, and interacting with readers. I can assure you that we don't see com - ments as simply a 'ghetto that will drive page views.' I will say that one of the easiest ways to convince writers that your comments are worth responding to is to say something intelligent (it doesn't necessarily have to be in agreement).\" http://www.theglobeandmail.com/blogs/ingram-20/ weve-got-new-community-features/article1148570/ 2. Imperative of the link economy: Make your - selves part of the discussion Media platforms need to open up and be found where their readers, viewers, and users are instead of locking in their content behind closed walls or pay walls. In the link economy, as outlined by Jeff Jarvis (director of the Graduate School of Journalism's new-media program at the City University of New York and author of \"What Would Google Do?\"), journalism sites are the more valuable, the more they are interconnected with the rest of the online world. Content that can't be searched and can't be found because it is hidden behind a pay-wall is less valuable in the link economy because it can only be discussed within small closed circles. The New York Times has recognized this principle and has re-opened its subscription-based web platform (\"Times Select\"). Since then web traffic has increased by more than 40 percent, and the additional revenue from advertising has made up for the loss of subscription revenues. The importance of links from users to free content can't be overestimated. According to the research company Hitwise, ten percent of all links from twitter point to traditional news websites. In absolute figures, Facebook links are even more important. 3. APIs: Journalism needs to be where the users are Examples: The Guardian, the New York Times, Na - tional Public Radio, and the BBC enable other sites to embed their content (widgets) and enable the news organizations to be everywhere the user wants them to be. The NYT announced in February 2009 that it has released a new Application Programming Interface (API) offering every article the paper has written since 1981, 2.8 million in all. The API includes 28 searchable fields and content updated every hour. ReadWriteWeb ana - lyzes: \"This is a big deal. A strong press organ with open data is to the rest of the web what basic newspaper delivery was to otherwise remote communities in another pe - riod of history. It's a transformation moment towards interconnectedness and away from isolation. A quality API could throw the doors wide open to a future where 'newspapers' are important again. \"What does that mean? It means that sites around the web will be able to add dynamic links to New York Times articles, or excerpts from those articles, to pages on their own sites. The ability to enrich other content with high quality Times supplementary content is a powerful prospect.\"4. Use multimedia forms of storytelling and en - able users' creativity The Guardian has visualized all the data in the MP expense scandal (who claimed what? who paid it back? who didn't?) in a spreadsheet. The most amazing thing about this is not the brilliant presentation, but rather the openness and collaborative character of the project which is manifested by this question the Guardian asks on its homepage: \u00b7Can you do something with this data? Please post us your visualizations and mash- ups below or mail us at datastore@guardian.co.uk. http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/may/13/mps-expenses-houseofcommons 5. Do what you do best and link to the rest For many years journalists have been taught not to link to competitors' sites, but to keep the traffic on the media company's own domain. They have to be re-taught. Ac - cording to Jeff Jarvis the culture of linking is creating a \"new architecture of news\". Jarvis: \"This leads to a new Golden Rule of Links in journalism - link unto others' good stuff as you would have them link unto your good stuff. This emerges from blogging etiquette but is exactly contrary to the old, competi - tive ways of news organizations: wasting now-precious resources matching competitors' stories so you could say you'd done it yourself. That must change.\" News sites should concentrate on their core value and recognize this quality in other sites too. Another Jarvis' rules apply: \"Do what you do best and link to the rest\" http://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/06/02/the-ethic- of-the-link-layer-on-news/ Again, blogs with their recognition of high-quality outside sites in their blog-rolls and links can serve as a role model. Some news sites have adopted this model:ProPublica, an independent, non-profit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest (publishing since June 2008), links to outside sites in its section \"Breaking on the Web\". ProPublica is led by Paul Steiger, the former managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, Stephen Engelberg, a former managing editor of The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon and former investigative editor of The New York Times as manag - ing editor.http://www.propublica.org/ The Washington Post also freely links outside in sections like \"Required Reading\" and \"Staff Picks\". 6. Think multi- medial Journalism training in 2009 needs to train print journal - ists to think in links, linear story tellers to think multi- linear, radio journalists to take pictures, and photogra - phers to use a video camera. Attractive content on web pages that really stands out is often designed in multi- media packages. Again the New York Times has gone a long way to experiment with being much more than a printed paper. Examples: \u00b7New York Times photo blog Lens (http://lens.blogs. nytimes.com/) \u00b7 Boston Globe photo blog The Big Picture (http:// www.boston.com/bigpicture/) 7. Make use of crowd-sourcingMedia companies should not only train professional journalists to be proficient with multi-linear and multi - media web reporting and using web 2.0 tools, but they should also teach new media enthusiasts to be more journalistic, i.e. use fact checking and quote correctly. Both groups shouldn't view each other as competitors, but should work together (\"crowd-sourcing\"). Collaborative journalism has huge potential. According to eMarketer, more than 82 million people in the U.S. created content online in 2008, a number expected to grow to nearly 115 million by 2013. 71 million people created content on social networks last year, while 21 million posted blogs, 15 million uploaded videos. 222 re-inventinG JournalisM?

He calls it \"a mixture of twit - ter, blogs, Craigslist and social networks\" in which the users have as much editorial power as professional journalists.

Problem: it is often more public relations driven than by checked and balanced journalism. Partner - ing publishing companies include daily newspapers Augsburger Allgemeine, Hannoversche Allgemeine, Neue Presse, Oberhessische Presse, and others. 8. Think hyper-localCrowd-sourcing offers opportunities to scale down jour - nalism to very small, targeted, and dedicated hyper-local groups. It is an opportunity to reconnect professional journalists, the neighborhood, and local advertisers who have never advertised in \"big media\" before, because the scale was too large for them. Now it isn't anymore. Examples: \u00b7Everyblock, funded by the Knight Foundation (http://www.everyblock.com/) \u00b7 Placeblogger, local blog aggregation site (http://pla - ceblogger.com/) \u00b7 In the Czech Republic hyper-local citizen jour - nalism is now produced in coffee shops (a project funded by investment firm PPF Group); more de - tails in the New York Times (http://www.nytimes. com/2009/05/11/technology/internet/11iht-papers. html?r=1&ref=technology) 9. Embrace citizen fundingA new idea to crowd-source not only journalism, but also its funding is Spot.Us (http://spot.us), an initiative started by 27-year-old US journalist, David Cohn, in San Francisco. At Spot.Us anyone can suggest a story. If it gets enough funding, professional journalists will pursue it. After publication, traditional media may re - print the story, in which case the donors are reimbursed. Cohn's project has some funding from the Knight Foundation. During the first six months 23 stories were published. The biggest donation has been collected for a fact check on a local political campaign. Cohn's jour - nalistic training includes collaboration with Jay Rosen, media professor at New York University, and founder of NewAssigment.net, a collaborative project for profes - sional and citizen journalists. 10. Embrace new technology New software and hardware tools that enable or facili - tate journalism 2.0 are being invented every day. Unfor - tunately, many German journalists are very reluctant to try them out. Examples: \u00b7Shared bookmarks and Wikis facilitate collaborative research \u00b7 Mobile reporting: streaming video to a website di - rectly from a mobile phone for live reports \u00b7 Inexpensive equipment like the Flip camera for video interviews. (The German tabloid Bild has made good use of them by selling a branded version to their citi - zen journalists. It has a special function for uploading videos directly to Bild.) \u00b7 Google Wave may have the potential to revolution - ize both real-time and collaborative reporting. \u00a9 Ulrike Langer Ulrike Langer is a Cologne-based freelance journal - ist specialized in new media issues and the media shift towards digital.

With media freedom se - verely cut, Somalis heavily rely on informal networks for news dissemination and dialogue. It was also noted that Somalis, traditionally nomads, are keen users of mobile communication technologies run by the large and politi - cally vocal Somali diaspora, who greatly influence news dissemination and political at home - hence a case for the absence of a functioning regulatory body and state. The mobile phone as a conflict prevention tool: Gone are the days when the mobile phone used to be just a telecommunication device. Today it has become a multimedia news-making tool that can be used as a video camera, a sound recorder, a Web browser. As the majority of people own one - which makes it makes it less intimidating- the mobile phone is indisputably the most efficient device for measuring the political and social temperature that, if not controlled in time, can es - calate into conflict. Introduced at the Forum, were four young people (from Kenya, Cameroon, Rwanda and Gabon) who filed mobile reports about their local com - munities, assisted by Voices of Africa Media Foundation to share information about the mobile phone experience in detecting the seed of conflict in the 2008 post-elec - tion violence in neighbouring Kenya! Such experience, it was observed, could also serve as vital inspiration for other regions and contexts. Re-inventing journalism: Journalistic training in the social media age: At the journalistic training symposium, it was revealed that more and more professional journal - ists around the world are finding themselves having to play catch-up with eye-witnesses when reporting break - ing stories. Armed with mobile camera phones which are connected to the Internet, these \"citizen journalists\" (eye-witnesses) are often determining the direction of news coverage! Indeed, these people who were until recently just \"users\" or \"consumers\" of the media, are now often presented on the screen as instant correspon - dents! The technology behind this speedy development is called social media. This catch phrase describes Web platforms where users can have an open exchange of opinions, views and personal experiences. In other words, on social media platforms anyone can communicate with anyone and anytime about any topic. Definitely, the speed at which this development has progressed is awesome. More speed, more partici - pants, more linkage, more media: new technologies are leading to continuously changing possibilities in com - munication. This has had a significant impact on the working conditions and the professional expectations of journalists and at the same time demands new means of specialized training to curb the current trends and chal - lenges. liberian's 'hun Ger For reliable Quality in ForMation' author: christoph spurk Publication: Journalists for human rights country: switzerland A new study released by the Institute of Applied Media Studies (IAM) in Zurich and the Center for Media Stud - ies and Peace Building (CEMESP) in Monrovia reveals Liberians call for very high media quality in reporting, though they are still reluctant to discuss the topic of reconciliation on the radio. At the Deutsche Welle Global Media conference in Germany this past June, IAM Media researcher Chris -press Clippings228 Press cli PPinGs 229 Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009 229toph Spurk presented the first results of a two-part study that analyzes how ordinary Liberians use the media, including what they expect from their news and what they actually get. In Sub-Saharan Africa there has been a dearth of research devoted to this area. This latest project provides empirical data that may actually help in - ternational donors, NGO's and local media outlets better assess the effectiveness of their news quality. The first part of the study, which began in Novem - ber 2007, looked at how 12 radio stations in Monrovia meet the expectations and needs of their listeners. Libe - ria is still in the midst of its post-conflict reconstruction phase. After 14 years of civil war and the more recent 2006 election of President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, Liberi - ans are rebuilding their country from scratch. Radio has long been the most popular medium. Both before and during the conflict, radio was largely politically domi - nated. Since the 2003 Peace Agreement, a flourishing of new radio stations has appeared. In the rural areas there are an estimated 35 community stations. With a low cir - culation of newspapers, at around 30,000 every second day, and no state television, radio plays a crucial role in what Spurk referred to as an \"information-poor society\". According to the study, around 85% of the popula - tion tune into the radio everyday. Over half of these people listen for more than two hours. This in itself is not surprising. Aside from being the cheapest way to get news, the radio also offers a social setting for Liberians to listen together. The researchers conducted 16 focus-group studies to see what stations were preferred and why. The individual groups ranged from government officials and affluent people to unemployed youth and shoe-shine boys. The findings reveal the top-four favourite stations for news and information are Star, Veritas, UNMIL (United Na - tions Mission in Liberia), and Truth. When asked which stations were the most trusted, the same names came up, this time with UNMIL at the top. As Spurk explained, 30% of the listeners based their 'favourites' and 'most trusted' on media quality. This 'quality' aspect was defined by the individuals them - selves. According to Spurk, listeners used such terms as \"exact, accurate, unbiased, balanced, independent, vari - ety of perspectives, and in-depth reporting\" to explain what they understand to be good journalism. While high-quality reporting is deeply rooted in the cultural requirements of a society, the research findings indicate Liberians share the same criteria of what consti - tutes quality journalism as typical in the West. Liberian listeners also discussed the need to have diverse view - points and sources of information so they could make their own opinions. While their post-listening habits were not clearly defined, the study did conclude that there was a high amount of discussion after listening. This means the media plays an important agenda-setting role in Liberia. It is not necessarily telling the audience what to think, but rather what to talk about. While common radio topics include issues of devel - opment, security, and education, the issue of reconcili - ation is still a difficult topic to broach on the radio. The reason for this is still uncertain. As Spurk explained, \"people expressed personal con - cerns of reconciliation quite often, but when it came to radio topics it seems the whole Liberian society becomes sensitive to conflict and the past... people hardly touch that.\" The second part of the research team's study is expected to be complete in the Fall 2009. This por - tion looks more specifically at how conflict is reported. Meanwhile, the results from part one have already pro - vided some helpful, if not unexpected findings. \"Even the Liberian journalists were surprised (by our results),\" said Spurk. \"This means there's no reason for them to follow donors who force them to do this (qual - ity journalism)...rather it is their own audience who force them to do good journalism\".

At Deutsche Welle's Global Media Forum \"Conflict Prevention in the Multimedia Age\" conference, author and professor Howard Rheingold explained that these situations exist because of participatory, or group, action, and journalism can use the positive aspects of participa - tory action as well. Howard Rheingold The conference's focus is on why and how journalism needs not only to accommodate but also to embrace a changing media world, specifically to help prevent local and global conflicts. Rheingold's address showed that just as multimedia has enabled major social and econom - ic accomplishments, it can do the same for journalism.Because citizens are so technologically adept, the media has to keep up. \"The role of the journalist is as impor - tant as ever,\" Rheingold said. \"But we now have mil - lions soon billions of reporters who are on the site as events happen.\" Rheingold said that as technology develops, human behaviors change along with them. For example, in his book \"Smart Mobs,\" Rheingold talks about the average citizen's newfound ability to organize collective ac - tion because of technology. Use of MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, and text messages has gar - nered action, reformed policies, and tipped elections.Participatory media is just a hop, skip, and a jump from these situations, said Rheingold. If participatory action such as open-sourcing and networking have accomplished so much, Rheingold said, participatory journalism has the potential to lower barriers, gather and educate the masses, and encourage dissemination of knowledge. And that's why it is important that reporting organi - zations understand the dynamics of multimedia. When used correctly, multimedia can further reporting efforts and perhaps even prevent conflict. *FOLLOWING are points that some of the opening and keynote speakers brought up. Many of the questions raised were not easy ones, piquing audience interests and providing fodder for continued discussion. Erik Bettermann, Director-General, Deutsche Welle \u00b7The subject of conflict prevention has gained re - newed relevance, specifically because of how the economic crisis and technology's developments affect the media. \u00b7In the multimedia age, the media has the option not only to cover damage but also to prevent conflict. \u00b7\"Journalism must go to where the users are and listen to their feedback.\" \u00b7High-speed, multimedia journalists are not fighting with the \"oldies.\" They need to work in tandem - it's not a competition. G\u00fcnter Nooke, Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office \u00b7Free press works best if it uses all forms of media to disseminate the news. \u00b7Does conflict prevention have any news value? Who reports about unexploded bombs? News arises when something happens. The event is what is spectacu - lar and newsworthy, and positive events rarely are. That's why people sometimes say media needs misery and disaster in order to report. \u00b7\"Reporting on a disaster is more than just news that we consume. Rather it is something that requires a response.\" Once you're an informed consumer, you need to ask yourself, \"What do I do with this infor - mation?\" The options aren't that clear-cut. Do you 232 Press cli PPinGs 233 Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009act and get accused of meddling in things you don't understand halfway around the world? Do you stay passive and get reproached for not acting? Andreas Krautscheid, Minister for Federal Affairs, Eu - rope and Media at the State of North Rhine-Westphalia \u00b7There is a downside to multimedia journalism: usu - ally, it isn't given the respect it's due. When people feel that all news should be available as soon as pos - sible, and there is constant access and availability to the news, then respect for the disseminators of the news is sorely lacking. \u00b7The fact that much of this easily-accessible news is often free may also contribute to this phenomenon. Soon-hong Choi, Assistant Secretary General, Chief Information Technology Officer, United Nations \u00b7How can we harness the strengths of both new and old media? \u00b7Streamlining the dissemination of information be - fore a conflict can help during the conflict. \u00b7The world of multimedia is not stagnant - it's con - stantly developing. Crowd-sourcing is a viable option because more and more people are getting internet access. FroM the h alls o F Deutsche Welle author: almudena toral Publication: radio b enevolencija When Radio Benevolencija started the \"Great Lakes Reconciliation Project\" five years ago in Rwanda, no one imagined 90 percent of the population would be addicted to the weekly, 20-minute soap opera called \"Musekeweya,\" aimed at changing attitudes in a country where trauma healing is certainly not easy. \"Musekeweya,\" meaning New Dawn, was born to cure wounds and bring neighbors together, to reconcile Hutus and Tutsis. It was born to create a common iden - tity and build peace, so Rwandans wouldn't feel any -more that crying was not acceptable and talking about the past not advisable. \"From identifying with the characters that turn from bad to good in the soap opera, people can change,\" says Johan Deflander, international development and com - munication expert who is the Head of Mission of La Be - nevolencija in Burundi, where they have another show. Through the combination of an entertainment and educational approach, their huge financial investment produces the best result: an overall change in behavior, leading to understanding and forgiveness. Their results are especially astonishing considering that radio was the main genocidal propaganda tool back in 1994, when Hutus killed as many as a million Tutsis and their Hutu supporters were killed in less than three months. Back then, radio listeners would get from the airwaves messages such as \"Kill the cockroaches!\"-to provoke Hutus to violence, mostly machete attacks and mass rapes against their Tutsi neighbors.. Today, radio is used to help both Hutus and Tutsis explain why geno - cide happened and how reconciliation is possible. But the key to this initiative's success is that the education and therapy are not explicit: \"Musekeweya\" is highly entertaining. The episodes picture how life flows on two hills that symbolize the two ethnicities of the country. About 30 characters fall in love, laugh, and talk openly about community problems. The Radio Project has been produced by \"a media cocktail,\" as Deflander calls it. Part of the funding pays for media plans and strong qualitative research. Togeth - er with a team of journalists, psychologists, and devel - opment practitioners, local people design the creative part of the episodes. \"Of course it can't be imported from the West,\" Deflander says. He also emphasizes the importance of involving the government and being 100 percent transparent, \"because they are essential in our process of shaping attitudes.\" Many Rwandans acknowledge \"Musekeweya\" has changed their lives. \"What is uniting us is far more im - portant than what is separating us,\" asserts a Rwandan in a film Deflander and his team put up to celebrate the 5th birthday of the radio show. Perhaps, as Radio Benevolencija demonstrates, more doctors around the world should prescribe soap operas for reconciliation.War 2.0 Are wars any different today than any other time in his - tory. How different? Or is it only media platforms that are changing? Writers Thomas Rid and Marc Hecker say war is changing but that it's not all related to the web. Their book, \"War 2.0 makes this point. \"Informa - tion technology helps insurgents, as most people know, but it's also a big challenge for them,\" asserts Hecker, researcher at Institut Francais des Relations Internation - ales. The authors acknowledge that Information technol - ogy is favoring insurgents by giving them new means for recruitment, new propaganda tools, and easy organiza - tion techniques. But change, they argue, runs in both directions. The two authors didn't have it easy defending their position at a workshop here at the Global Media Forum. Many participants criticized their views, mainly argu - ing war's war and will always be, and that new media is what's changing war. The revolution in technology, the authors said, is accompanied by a dramatic change in warfare itself, with less traditional, one-on-one, good-versus-bad conflicts. Now wars are asymmetric. \"Today the visual framing of conflict is not only one-sided; groups gained the right to create their own visual representations,\" asserts Hecker. Both sides in a war adapt to new media platforms and have to learn to use media to their advantage. A third speaker, Sebastian Kaempf, who has mainly based his post-doctoral research on the U.S. war on ter - ror, emphasized the role of the media in transforming wars' visual representation. \"War is evolving online, not only on the ground,\" he adds. \"Now small actors have greater power thanks to the media,\" continues Thomas Rid, a research fellow in School of Advanced International Studies, Johns Hop - kins University, \"and journalists have a lot to learn.\"Blog Deutsche Welle Global Me Dia Foru M - Autor mehrerer Anfang Juni nach Bonn: Howard Rheingold (USA) er\u00f6ffnet am Mittwoch, 3.

Juni: Medien - schaffenden. inhaftierten Menschenrechtlers Hu Jia and schildert in ihrem Mobs author: Guardian Publication: news aktuell country: Deutschland Howard Rheingold was using computers at Xerox in 1973. He created the term virtual commuity in 1993. He coined the phrase smart mobs. He started his talk by saying: \"I\u00b4m here to enlist you in helping to think about 236 Press cli PPinGs 237 Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009spreading a new story about how humans get things together. We all know the old story. We learn it when we\u00b4re very young. It\u00b4s reinforced by our culture, educa - tion and until recently science. Biology is war. Businesses and nations succeed only by defeating, destroying or or dominating opposition. Politics is about winning at all costs. In the last decade, I see a new story emerging across a very wide number of disciplines. Competition is still central but it still shrinks a little bit to leave room for co- operative arrangements and complex interdependencies.\" In spring 2000, he found himself on the streets of Tokyo. He saw something unusual for American eyes. He admitted that it was probably not odd for people outside of the US, but it was novel for him. He wsaw people in Tokyo walking down the street looking at their telephones. Now, a trillion SMS messages are sent a year, he said. Later, he was in Helsinki, and he saw people carry - ing their mobile. phones in their hands and looking at them very often. Three teenagers stopped to speak with two older adults. Not speaking Finnish, he didn't un - derstand the conversation. One of the teenagers looked at the phone screen. He showed it to his teenage friends but not to the adults. The conversation continued as if this were normal. He referred to the protests in the Philippines that were organised largely by text messages, and which brought down the Estrada government, and in discussing this with a friend (who sounds a lot like Clay Shirky) his friend said: \"It looks to me that the barrier to collective action has been lowered.\" This led him to coin the term smart mobs. It de - scribes the new-found ability to organise all kinds of collective action because of media, using the mobile phone and the internet. Mobile phones, computers and the internet are con - verging. In 1980, the computer was really just a toy. In 1990, the internet was just text, very slow text at that. If we think about this emerging medium, it will undoubt - edly develop very rapidly. After he wrote his book, he was sent images from around the world by people who recognised that smart mobs were happening. In South Korea, the candidate liked by the younger generation was losing. The Korean citizen journalism site, OhMyNews, sent a text message to people telling them to vote. The candidate favoured by the young won and gave his first interview to OhM - yNews. In Spain, the Madrid bombing was originally blamed on Basque separatists. Spanish people thought they were being lied to so they sent text messages letting each other know about a protest outside the government headquar - ters. The underdog, socialist candidate Zapatero won in the following elections thanks in part to this SMS-based protest. Some America students used social networking and SMS to organise protests against a bill they thought could lead to the deportation of their parents. The US Congress has yet o pass that bill. He talked about how the Obama campaign used Facebook, SMS and other social networking tools to bring together the hierarchal nature of a presidential campaign with grassroots organising. The campaign would come to a state and discover supporters had already been mobilised due to the use of social network - ing and SMS. It's leading to new ways to organise not just individuals but also in traditional organisations like government. We're beginning to see an experiment in the US to use wiki to create public policy. But the effect of this organisation is not always posi - tive. Rheingold pointed to the protests in Nigeria over the Miss World competition and how Australian racists used SMS to organise the beatings of minorities. He had predicted that a picture from a camera phone would be the key image of an event, and it happened first at the 7 July 2005 bombings in London and now we see it much more frequently. He showed the image of the US Airways flight that landed in the Hudson. We all talk about verification and context. We now have millions of reporters on the site of a story. Rheingold then discussed the spread of knowledge through the development of alphabets and the printing press. \"The revolutions of the 18th century that replaced monarchies with democracies were literate revolutions.\" Not saying that science, the reformation or democracy were created by the printing press. But the technologies allowed people to communicate and organise in differ - ent ways.Participatory media include blogs, wilds, video shar - ing, tagging, bookmark sharing, video blogs. They have three characteristics: \u00b7Many-to-many media make it possible for people to broadcast and receive all kinds of information. They are social media, the value is form the participation and communication of people. \u00b7Faster networks increase reach and power As he said before, these methods are moving outside politics and into business. IBM, HP and Sun have re - leased their software under open-source licencing. IBM went from open-source accounting for none of its rev - enue to a majority of its revenue in four years. Eli Lilly uses a collaborative tool called Innocentive to help it develop its drugs. Google and Amazon have opened their crown jewels. Programmers have created millions of ways to create shops on Amazon. Google opened its advertising platform and allowed people to use its AdSense service. eBay helps solve the dilemma of carrying out transac - tions with people you don't know. Now we're seeing distributed computing platforms such as SETI@home being used to look for patterns of alien life in signals from outer space. Folding@home processes protein folding. We don't understand the scope of the problems that can be solved using this distributed computing process, he said. Rheingold says that we're at a very early stage in see - ing what is possible with these collaborative technolo - gies. He compared it to the changes that came in medi - cine after germ theory. It was a fundamental change, but it took time for the discovery to have its full impact.toP eu o FFicial Questions 'P eace country: Malaysia Wednesday 03 Tun 2009: A top European Union official has cautioned against the concept of 'peace journalism', under which journalists would actively promote peace as part of their coverage of conflicts. Javier Solana, EU High Representative for the Com - mon Foreign and Security Policy, made the remarks in a written contribution to the Deutsche Welle Global Media Forum, which opened today in Bonn. \"We all want to promote peace, reconciliation and conflict resolution and we want the media to help us in this way in which they can do this is to inform us. This is the journalist's fundamental task. \"We should be careful not to weigh down the me - dia with additional responsibilities over and above their prime providing information.\" Mr Solana, a former NATO Secretary-General, said peace journalism should mean striving to give as much quality information as possible.The three-day conference is focusing on conflict prevention in the multimedia age. kuba verW eiGert and teilte G eDia ForuM 2009uan, und des seit gestern lau - fenden Deutsche Welle es urn neue Technologien and deren Folgen Vertreter aus der Poli - tik wie der auf dem Global Media Forum\" der Deut - rer Stadt aufmerksani deutschen Auslandsrundfunks, Erik Bettermann, zum Abschluss des Deutsche Welle Global Media Forums in Bonn bekannt. \"Wir bauen auf Afghanistan wichtigste Medium - aus and stelle es begleitend im Internet bei MeDia or Fail, broa Dcasters tol D author: a ndy sia-Pacific b roadcasting u nion country: Malaysia Traditional broadcasters will become irrelevant within a few years unless they adopt the new media, an interna - tional conference in Bonn heard today.

He told the Global Media Forum that it was essential for broad - casters to use online media to reach as wide an audience as possible. In a sea of digital choice, one thing that would allow them to stand out was their brand, he said. The Director of the Singapore-based Asia Journalism Fellowship, P N Balji, said traditional media was still the major force in Singapore because no one had yet found a way to make money out of the new media. However, he said broadcasters knew the \"new media tsunami\" was coming. But they did know when it would come or how to deal with it. Journalists Warne D not to sacri Fice stanD arDs author: andre Wright Publication: Jamaica Gleaner coutry: Jamaica Journalists worldwide have been urged to uphold the highest standards of the profession, even as news-gath - ering and distribution become more dynamic through technological advances across the ever-widening media landscape. Erik Bettermann, director general of the Germany- based news agency Deutsche Welle, has warned media houses against sacrificing the basic tenets of journalism - fairness and factuality - for bragging rights in the com - petitive hunt to break stories first. Live up to responsibility \"One thing is clear: media are duty-bound to live up to responsibility. \"It is increasingly more important for media to provide awareness of how problems will be solved. This presupposes professional journalists will act with respon - sibility.\" Bettermann was speaking at Wednesday's opening ceremony of the Deutsche Welle Global Media Forum in the German city Bonn. The forum, which is focusing on conflict prevention in the multimedia age, is being held for the second time. The news agency executive also highlighted the broadening tentacles of multimedia, including the Internet, social-networking sites and the blogosphere, as critical to the promotion of democracy across the globe, even in countries with strict controls on the press. \"The monopoly has been dismantled,\" said Better - mann, pointing to Belarus, Iran and Cuba as countries where the so-called new media are pulling away the knuckles, if only slightly, of government control. \"Democratisation cannot be blocked, even though China has attempted to block the Internet ... Freedom of the press promotes democracy. Democracy adds value to citizens.\" More balanced G\u00fcnter Nokke, commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid at the German Federal Foreign Office, also urged media practitioners at the conference to publish a more balanced diet of positive and negative news. \"Media need misery, need disaster,\" said Nokke, \"but good news must be available, not because we try to ignore disaster, but because we can (demonstrate a vi - sion) of the world without disaster.\" Pakistani MeDia reco Gnise D For innovative Journalis M in asia Publication: t he n ation country: Pakistan KARACHI (APP) - The Pakistani media recognised for playing a leading role in developing innovation in the Asian region. This was announced in a statement of SAAMA Television issued here on Saturday. It pointed out that the SAMAA TV was applauded for its innovative media initiatives at the European Journalism Centre. The statement said that a three-day workshop on 'constructive innovation journalism' was held at the Deutsche Welle Global Media Summit be - tween June 3-5 at the European Journalism Centre. The workshop, it added, was aimed at sharing media models 'to promote constructive journalism linked with innovation as a key component to improve the global socio-economic development, in particular for the de - veloping countries. The statement said that Urdu news channels rep - resented the Asian region based on its leading role in promoting constructive innovation journalism across the globe. Speaking on the occasion Fatima Akhtar, Senior Manager Interactive Solutions of SAMAA TV, empha - sised on the need for constructive innovation journalism was highly relevant and required in Pakistan, as since long, the local media has been very aggressive in raising the issues but has ignored the perspective of solutions. She said that news should not be looked upon as a piece of information or used as a tool to create hype among the audience, but that it is a flow of Informa - tion which carries implications for the individual citizen - impaling and contributing to the individual's social, economic and political decisions and pave the future road map of a nation. Ms. Fatima reinforced on the need to link journalism with Innovation so that the focus on solutions become the economy driver. David Nordfors, Executive Director of the VINNOVA Stanford Research Center of Innovation Journalism at Stanford University, also spoke on solutions being the key element in new business models for journalism. He applauded TV for demonstrating construc - tive journalism and providing incentives to journalism by generating constructive and proportional attention around issues, empowering people and bringing value to society. According to Nordfors really good business models for journalism bring prosperity to the journal - ism industry, its audience, and the society it works in. Nordfors said that 'You can't measure a system without influencing it, which is the case of journalism today especially when covering terrorism. We are now mov -ing into the attention economy, where information is no longer a scarce commodity. But attention is'. He also said that this is a good time for researchers to look at how different journalism business models gener - ate different sorts of collective attention, and how that drives the collective intelligence. The statement further pointed out that TV's dedication for linking journal - ism with innovation also reflects in their programming, which has resulted in the launch of Pakistan's first pro - gramme on innovation. It said that the TV's launch of the Polio Control Cell, a joint initiative with UNICEF and the Ministry of Health has also achieved great acknowledgement among the international development organisations and has been recommended as the Pakistan model, encouraging other developing nations to replicate for achieving full success in the eradication of the polio virus. One of the key panel members, Director News Danish Radio, Ulrik Haagerup, said that for sound new business models to arise, journalism needs to come to grips with its inevitable role as an actor. Instead of discussing why journalists should not get involved with sources or become parts of the stories they tell, perhaps the solution is for journalists to discuss why they should get involved. Haagerup said that journalists must find a way to do so without losing the essence of journalism, as it is not enough to show the problem and the awfulness of horrible situations. According to him such journalism only feeds collec - tive obsession, neurosis and ultimately, depression. He concluded by saying that journalism must cover prob - lems from the perspective of how they can be solved, as only then can the collective attention be very construc - tive. The panel members conduded the workshop by stat - ing that constructive journalism should look for all kinds of possible solutions, comparing and scrutinizing them, finding relevant examples and Involving the stakeholders in the process of finding solutions.242 Press cli PPinGs 243 Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009GooD Discussions in bonn; Mur Der in MoGaDishu author: Frank smyth Publication: c ommittee to Protect Journalists, n ew y ork country: usa Journalism conferences discussing global trends often inflate the real but intermittent risks faced by foreign correspondents from wealthier nations who travel to and report from less stable regions of the world. They do so at the expense of downplaying if not plain ignoring the much greater risks faced by local journalists who live in such areas with their families and report daily for home - grown, regional media. The Deutsche Welle annual Global Media Forum in Bonn is not one of them. Every year the German state broadcast agency spends the time and resources to bring together journalists from each continent to discuss how their respective and collective work might help prevent violence and other forms of destruction. This year's conference-held these days in the post-Cold War era at the old West German Bundestag building in Bonn-brought in many partici - pants from sub-Saharan Africa. One of the three-day conference's more compelling panels focused on the literally war-torn nation of Soma - lia. No one knew that by the end of the week one of the colleagues of the representative from the well-respected and all-toofrequently bloodied Radio Shabelle would be shot dead and another would be left wounded in Moga - dishu. Analog or old-fashioned radio is still the most com - mon news platform throughout most of Africa, as it is in South Asia and many other areas where most people live in or near poverty. But digital technology is catching up across the sub-Saharan continent at an exponential rate, noted Harry Dugmore from Rhodes University in South Africa. The white South African professor runs lindaba Zlyafika or 'The News Is Coming\" proj - ect funded by the U.S.- based Knight Foundation. Cell phones with text messaging capability will soon be in the hands of most Africans, said Dugmore, who added that Internet technology is not far behind. African journalists in particular, however, noted that practitioners of the new technology may be cheapening the profession. Mildred Ngesa is a seven-time award- winning print journalist from Kenya, but she could have easily been speaking about journalism in many nations. We need to recover \"the soul of journalism,\" she said to applause on one panel, pointing out that online media has often helped spread rumors, innuendo and outright falsehoods about events and people in Kenya. She made the call for journalists in all platforms to return to what the unofficial deans of journalism ethics in the United States, Bill Kovach and Tom Rosentiel, have called the \"discipline of verification.\" Somali journalists were critical of online media for another reason. The nation still has outlets led by radio news stations, but foreign-based Web sites focused on Somalia have proliferated in recent years. Renowned journalist Omar Faruk Osman, who is also a press free - dom advocate and trade union leader, along with Mo - hamed Amiin Adow of the independent Shabelle Media Network, both said that most of the diaspora-based Web sites are linked to different armed clans or other groups. Their reporting, they argued, promotes factionalism over any notion of professional reporting. But you shouldn't paint any media platform with too broad a brush, noted Abbas Gassem, founder of Inside - Somalia.org. No doubt online journalism represents some of the most enterprising reporting in many nations CPJ organized a conference panel on the attempts by governments to censor the Internet. Yaman Akdeniz, director of the U.K.- based Cyber-Rights & Cyber- Liberties, described how laws designed to control vices like child pornography and online gambling can also be used in nations like Turkey to restrict news and informa - tion. Noha Atef, founder and director of TortureinEgypt. net, spoke about reporting on torture and other abuses by government authorities in Egypt. Chinese blogger Yang Hengjun criticized Western firms that help China build the technology required to block and filter Internet sites. Lisa Horner of Global Partners & Associates, a social pur - pose company based in London, addressed the pros and cons of efforts including the Global Network Initiative supported by CPJ to try to overcome Web censorship.How to measure the impact of any press freedom effort is difficult. People often ask CPJ how we calculate suc - cess. There are few if any reliable scientific or statistical methods to do so. But the anecdotal evidence is compel - ling. Throughout the three days in Bonn, one Journalist after another from nations on nearly every continent sought me out to tell me how grateful each remains to CPJ for having helped them when facing risks of im - prisonment, violence, or other hazards in their respec - tive nations. \"When I heard there was someone here from CPJ I just wanted to find you,\" said Jahangir Alam Akash, editor of Human Rights Today in Bangladesh. I also took to heart the welcoming nods, smiles, and kind words received from journalists like Faruk and Amiin from Somalia. That was Thursday in Bonn. Three days later Radio Shabelle Director Mukhtar Mo - hamed Hirabe was gunned down in Mogadishu; News Editor Ahmad Omar Hashi was wounded. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families and col - leagues. Hirabe, 48, was the third Shabelle journalists killed this year, and the fifth overall. Somalia is the most dangerous country in Africa to work as a journalist, with five journalists killed this year, according to CPJ research. The latest attack may have been due to false stories that claimed Islamist opposition leader Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys was killed or seriously injured during an intense Friday conflict that killed more than 120 people, according to wire reports. But some of Hashi and Hira - bi's colleagues said they believe insurgents are targeting Somalia's leading independent radio stations in an effort to control the airwaves. Radio Shabelle is currently off the air since the majority of workers have either fled or are in hiding, Editor-in-Chief Addirahman Yusuf told CPJ.

Although majority of the participants at the capacity building event were excited in the new media, speaker after speaker in a session on 'Mobile phone as a conflict prevention tool' hosted by Voices of Africa Media Foun - dation believed that conflicts will remain unabated in most regions of the world, especially in African coun -tries unless journalists were empowered with modem mobile technologies to effectively monitor the impact of projects in the region, especially during elections said to be one the major causes of conflicts in the region . While recommending for increase in the number of mobile reporters in Kenya and other African countries to get a broader, more representative picture of events that may resolve into conflicts, the speakers noted that an exploration of mobile reporting applicability in other countries exposed to conflicts will go a long way in reducing conflicts to the barest minimum. For the Director General of Deutsche Welle, Erik Bettermam, the media in the digital age in many areas, are required for conflict avoidance. \"And conflict prevention using new media begins at home. And when people play virtual war games, there is relevant connection to social conditioning . The fact that video games have become the most useful form of recruitment for the US military only underlines the so - cial connotations\" he explained. Using multimedia tools in the 21st century knowledge economy , he said that the media bears a great responsibility, adding that this is especially true of their active role in conflict prevention. Speaking further on the very important role mobile phone could play in preventing conflicts during the capacity building event, the program Manager, Voices of Africa, Henri Ailders said that prevention of conflicts is achievable if journalists are equipped with IT tools and knowledge in the knowledge economy, adding that technology can be leveraged to manage crisis. \"We are here to share not only experience in detect - ing the seed of conflict in Kenya, but how that experi - ence can serve as inspiration for other regions and con - texts,\" he said. Local mobile reporters, he said can effectively moni - tor projects in Africa, thereby reducing conflicts to the barest minimum in different regions of the continents that are conflict ridden. In another session hosted by ICT4peace, the modera - tor, Alain Modoux, former Assistant Director General of UNESCO for Freedom of Expression, Democracy and Peace told the capacity audience listing with keen interest that conflicts in different regions of the world is possible if journalists were well equipped with multime - dia gadgets.According to him, 21st century journalism needs well trained reporters with multimedia equipment for the challenges ahead. What technological capabilities and organizational commitments are needed to address these challenges today? How will the United Nations act as a global thought-leader in these regards? We already have web and intemet tools, services and platforms with millions of users - can they be leveraged to transform crises and for humanitarian aid? Why will crisis information man - agement play a vital role in peace-building operations in the future were among burning questions asked by experts during the world conference on conflict preven - tion in the multimedia age that have the participation of journalists across the world. In the capacity building conference that had more than 1,200 participants from approximately 100 coun - tries, experts were able to discuss and exchange ideas on how best to use latest technologies available in the world to prevent conflicts that have been eating deep into socio-economic fabrics of nations of the world. Representatives from the media, politics, NGOs, business, science and culture joined in the discussions with Deutsche Welle partners and NGOs at the confer - ence that featured more than 50 different events. MeDia con Ference in bonn author: v oices of a frica Media Foundation From June third to June fifth 2009, media experts, in - cluding practioners, scholars, and policy makers from all over the globe met in Bonn, the former Federal Capital of Germany, precisely at the sumptuous World Confer - ence Centre, to discuss the recent development in media. The theme of this year's edition being 'Conflict preven - tion in the Multimedia Age', the VoicesofAfrica mobile reporting could not be absent. Three alumni of the proj - ect from Cameroon, Ghana, and Kenya together with the project coordination team entertained the audience about the mobile phone as a conflict prevention tool'. In fact, the reports made in late 2007 prior to the presiden - tial poll in Kenya allow to conclude that mobile report - ers had detected the signs showing that there would be violence in the country.

Worl D Must invest in GooD Quality Journalis M boakye-Dankwa boadi Publication: Ghana n ews a gency country: Ghana Bonn, June 5, GNA - The world must be ready to invest in good quality journalism worldwide, Deutsche Welle Director General, Erik Bettermann, said at the opening of the Second Global Media Forum in Bonn, Germany. He argued: \"In the future, it will be required for civil society and the peacemaking processes, publishers and broadcasters to drastically assimilate to a changing media world in order to maintain journalism with qua - lity and relevant content.\" Mr Bettermann said although journalists might have lost their monopoly on reporting world issues, they were gaining a new function as scouts for the increasingly confusing media world. \"Reliability and independent and balanced reporting will be valued even more in the future,\" stated Better - mann with confidence. He went on to say that journa - lists were required to live up to their social responsibility and that \"a return to distinctive journalistic ethics is necessary\". \"New media isn't destroying journalism, but rather evolving a media-encompassing copy and paste philoso - phy and digital content recycling,\" he said, adding \"high speed-journalism isn't the only answer in the frenzy of new media.\" He said the financial and economic crisis, which had heavily affected the media markets and structure, had reinforced these tendencies even more. The battered structures - like the shrinking local editorial departments and news agencies - will be hard to regenerate. \"We must actively counteract the depletion of jour - nalistic resources and the loss of pluralism,\" said Mr Bettermann. He went on to say that the \"reconciliation of tra - ditional and new media\" could lead to effective new formats and that the individual strengths had to be used and combined intelligently. This, he said, \"creates a possibility that didn't exist before - to use journalism to leave an even more lasting impression on the public and thereby be economically successful as a media company\". The Head of Germany's international broadcaster referred to the importance of new media for restric - ted societies, saying the Blogs and Twitter had broken through the governmental monopoly on information in many countries. \"Today, anyone can be a public watchdog. It is now even possible for people in isolated countries to receive first-hand information from around the globe. Demo - cracy and the public outcry for human rights can't be subdued. Worldwide the media is taking huge steps towards democracy. When I look at China or Iran, it becomes clear to me. The foundation is in place.\" Mr Betterman said in many developing and emer - ging countries there would be digital leaps that people never expected. The role of the western world was to support these efforts - for example with training and education for media professionals. About 900 participants are taking part in the global event, which is under the theme \"Conflict Prevention in the Multimedia Age\". The Foundation for International Dialogue of the Sparkasse in Bonn is co-hosting the event. The convention is also supported by Germany's Federal Foreign Office; the government of the Ger - man State of North Rhine-Westphalia and the city of Bonn; DHL; The Economist; of news aktuell and picture alliance.conflits: cas de la Somalie, Voices of Africa s'int\u00e9ressera sur le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone mobile comme un outil de pr\u00e9vention des conflits... et d\u00e9bats \u00e9taient francs et ouverts.

Mr Choi said this at the Deutsche Welle Global Media Forum held at the world conference centre in Bonn city, Germany. Over 800 journalists from Africa, Europe, Asia and United States of America are partici - pating. The international conference theme is, Conflict Prevention in Multimedia Age. He said there is need to find power to harness and find solutions to better information especially in times of crisis. Mr Choi cited internally displaced people by disasters and other cala - mities such as tsunamis as critical areas where they must focus on finding solutions.He urged non-governmental organisations and the media to play a more critical role in conflict prevention. He said there was need for the public and private sector to take a new approach by investing more resources in new technologies if they are to deal with crises. \"Streamlining and digitisation are critical to in - formation and can play a direct influence in decision making and improve on the information published,\u00bb he said. And Deutsche Welle (DW) director general, Erik Bettermann said the financial and economic crisis was worsening the situation in the way media producers and journalists operated. Mr Bettermann said there is need for journalism to go where the users are and put up with the feedback they give. He said users are increasingly seeking quality and reliability. \"But the editors of new media must be integrated into this globally important responsibility. We must make clear that the media work is not a high per - formance contest, but create an awareness of the social function that even a blogger fulfils,\u00bb he said.250 Press cli PPinGs 251 Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009African States with respective ideologies. ( Ogot 2009) Conflict over access to natural resources, especially ac - cess to land and water is another defining feature of new conflict in Uganda and much of Africa. It is pronounced in Uganda's case, due to a steep rise in population growth, and plummeting of agricultural production per acre and the effects of climate change. At 6.1, Uganda has one the highest fertility rates in the World, after Nigeria and Yemen. occurrence of Conflict in Uganda at n ational Scale t able 1 Conflict points3 number of occurrence 10Year/s of o ccurrence Military c oup 2 1971, 1985 conventional War 1 1978, 1979 Guerilla War 1 1981-1986 armed rebellion 4+ 1986-2009 constitutional crisis 2 1966, 2005 Source: A Recent History of Uganda Response by the State to Conflict Two main responses have characterized conflict in Uganda, the first being the attempt at total elimination of opponents through war or extra judicial killings and the second, assimilation or integration of opponents by peaceful means. The first response was most visible during the rule of President Idi Amin from 1971-1979. An estimated 300,000 were killed by state agents during President Idi Amin's eight year rule in Uganda for perceived opposi - tion to the regime. Assimilation of political opponents has been most visible during the rule of President Yoweri Museveni from 1986- to date. At least four different rebel groups previously engaged in armed struggle against the Gov - ernment of Uganda under Yoweri Museveni, have been assimilated into the government. Only with the Lord's Resistance Army and it's leader Joseph Kony have peace negotiations not yet borne fruits. Conflict and Democracy in Uganda In evaluating conflicts in Africa, it is important to note that democracy as an ideological pillar of the modern world, and the presence of institutions of democracy in Africa, has not been successful as a vehicle for the prevention of conflict. Most countries in Africa cur - rently engaged in conflicts of varying types purport to be democratic states and have institutions of democracy ingrained in state apparatus. Even with the rituals of democracy such as holding elections, and the semblance of the rule of law in place, democracy has not been sufficient an arbiter of conflicts in Africa. It has been used as an instrument of inter - national legitimization of the power of Africa's ruling classes instead. The sources of conflict in African states is for the most part subtle, multi-faceted and in a state of mutation. The Multi-Media Age and Conflict in Uganda The multi-media era, typified by the proliferation of new media arrived in Uganda around 1999. This era witnessed phenomenal growth of both traditional and new media in Uganda, making Uganda the country with the highest concentration of electronic media, mainly FM Radio Stations in Africa.Introduction Conflict, the existence and confrontation between divergent opinions, beliefs, world views and persons is considered an inescapable fact of human existence. It occurs at individual, community, national, continental and global levels. This paper examines conflict in Uganda at national level for a period of 40 years. Between 1962, when Brit - ain conceded self rule to Uganda , after 60 years of co - lonial rule, and 2002, when Uganda stood at the thresh - old of multi media revolution. The paper also touches on the growth of the electronic media from 1993, when Uganda liberalized the airwaves, and the entry of multi media technology -the internet and mobile telephony, and how these developments have contributed to conflict prevention and peace building in Uganda. In addition, this paper asserts that proliferation of multi-media technology and responsible transfer of tech - nology from the developed countries to least developed countries, especially countries in Sub Saharan Africa, could remedy conflict in the region and lay the founda - tion for lasting peace. The Dynamic of Conflict in Uganda Uganda plunged into national scale conflict in less than three years after the attainment of self rule in 1962. Uganda has experienced recurrent conflict ever since. The resultant effects has been; loss of life, loss of prop - erty, interruption and retardation in economic growth and exportation of conflict to neighboring countries such as Rwanda, Congo and the Sudan. A quantification of loss in productivity and monetary value, as a result of conflict in Uganda could yield astronomical figures. The nature of conflict in Uganda, as in many other African countries, have centered around the following dynamic: \u00b7Contest for political power and the attendant benefits that accrue from acquisition of power. \u00b7Assertion of ethnic supremacy and ethnic identity. \u00b7 Reverberation of global ideological conflicts \u00b7 Securing access to and control of diminishing natural resources, especially land. That African countries have not been plagued by class conflict, except in South Africa where racial conflict accentuated class conflict in the apartheid era, is instruc - tive. This is so because Africa did not experience the process of industrialization to produce a distinct class of workers and bourgeoisie as in the Western World. In Uganda and most of Africa, common group identity is still derived from ethnicity and religion. Contest for political power is a dynamic in conflict in Uganda and Africa in general because aspirants to political offices on the whole view political power as a means to achieve personal economic security and that of the immediate ethnic grouping that surrounds the aspi - rant to political office. This fact is reflected in (Wanjala, 2009) when he states thus: \"State power in African countries has been the major arena of privilege.. and it has been accessible to ambi - tious men of humble origin.\" The quest for political power is thus motivated by the desire to control state resources and their authoritative allocation.\" The reality about African politics around which the continents' conflict revolved is that politics is still about allocation of ready resources as opposed to creation of new resources through production. African politics fits well into (Lasswell, 58) definition of politics as being 'who gets what, when and how'. The ethnic element factors in as a dynamic because in the quest to national leadership, most leaders in Uganda, as in other African countries, have drawn core support from the leaders' ethnic grouping. It is this same dynamic that has triggered off competition for suprem - acy among ethnic groups and the assertion of ethnic identity at national level. Reverberation of global ideological conflict was felt mainly during the climax of the cold war between 1970-1985, when the two super powers at the time, the United States and the Soviet Union sought to influence ConFLICT P REVE nTIon A nD PEACE BUILDI nG THRoUGH MULTI-MEDIA In UGA nDA By Joe n am, Uganda Deutsche W elle G lobal M eDia ForuM 2009252 PaPer 253Growth of the Electronic Media in Uganda from 1994-2008 Table 2 Year Media number of Stations on Air 1994 tv 1 2008 tv 48 1994 FM r adio 0 2008 FM r adi 192 Source: Uganda Communications Commission Parallel to the growth of the electronic media is the growth of mobile telephony. Mobile Phone subscribers grew from 0 in 1999 to 9 Million in 2008 , and mobile telephony service provid - ers grew to 5 in the same decade. The development of multi-media and informa - tion and communication technology has further been strengthened by the growth of the internet. The con - nection of Uganda to the global fibre optic network later this year is expected to cement transition to the infor - mation age. With increased bandwidth, accessibility and affordable use of multi-media and information and communication technology, Uganda will be on course in transformation to the information society. The growth of multi media and information and communication technology has had practical impact in business, especially the growth of Small and Medium Size Enterprises, and also in social interaction and con - flict prevention. The last peace negotiations between the Gov - ernment of Uganda and the Lords Resistance Army commander Joseph Kony, which took place between 2006- 2008 was conducted mainly on the multi-media platform, that is mobile telephone and satellite phone. As a result, a number of hostages, mainly women and children held by the Lords Resistance Army LRA were released by the rebels in the past three years.Conflict Prevention and Communication Theorist have long established the correlation between two way flow of communication and conflict resolu - tion or prevention of potential conflict from breaking out. Between 2006 and 2007, the hosting on air of rebel leaders and commanders of the LRA in Uganda on several radio stations led to considerable easing of tension between the LRA and civilian population in war af- fected areas. Here in lies the effectiveness of multi-media technology, that 'enemies' can speak to each other from the safety of distance yet closeness of emotion to release pent up anger, animosity and even misconceptions of each other. The availability in the opportunity to com - municate is therefore a boost in the effort to prevent conflict. This applies to all levels of communication between antagonistic parties. And multi-media technol - ogy increases the opportunity to communicate. The freedom of unfettered communication both at private and individual level, and also in the mass media, is complimentary to efforts at conflict prevention. In press freedom rating, Uganda is rated as 'fair' by the US based Freedom House. Uganda comes second to South Africa in press freedom in the Sub Saharan region. This relative press freedom has afforded the venting of griev - ances against the government, by citizens, through ex - pressing their discontent in the mass media, using multi- media technology such mobile phone and facilitating communication and conflict prevention in the process. The growth of multi-media has also produced a more informed citizenry who are empowered with a variety of information and communication channels to handle conflict from an informed point of view. ( Ko - atent, 2000 ) gives a befitting summary thus: During the 21st Century, the ability of Africans to communicate is expected to grow markedly, through the use of facilities such as cellular phones, email, participa - tory media, personal computers, video conferencing, in - ternet and tele fax, which ought to be accessible to many people since information will be a valuable commodity. The 21st Century will usher in high tech devices that will expand human freedom in offering the various information and hence a variety to choose from. Multi-Media Technology and Peace Building Contemporary wisdom points to the fact that a society with increasing prospects of prosperity and the likeli - hood to consolidate economic, scientific and cultural gains, learns to prevent conflict naturally through in - built internal mechanisms and common dividends from peace. In Uganda the growth of Small and Medium Size Enterprises made possible by the business opportuni - ties afforded by multi-media technology such as mobile telephony and the internet has been a strong motivation for conflict prevention and peace building. Over 90 percent of Uganda's private sector comprises Small and Medium Sized Enterprises which provide employment and tax revenue to the government hence pre-emptying conflict that would have arisen as a result of poverty and unemployment. Emerging n ational Conflicts and Their Solutions A conflict free society is an ideal for which every soci - ety aspires, but one that needs concrete investments in conflict resolution and peace building, to attain. At the global level, the point of conflict still centres on the fight against terrorism and the resurgence of religious fun - damentalism. Inter-state and intra-state conflict mean - while continue to scourge African countries. An emerging and potentially devastating intra-state conflict in Uganda and parts of Africa, when allowed to full development, is conflict over access to natural resources, especially access to land and water for agricul - tural use. Conclusion The emerging consensus in Africa and Uganda however is that conflict can best be prevented through economic development which benefits is evenly spread out in the population. Put in other words, the prospects for evenly spread out prosperity in society tends to minimize con - flict. Africa and Uganda can become prosperous when it's international debt obligations is unconditionally cancelled. When it is accorded fair treatment in interna - tional trade agreements both at the World Trade Orga - nization and Economic Partnerships Agreement with the European Union. When it receives technological transfer for industrialization and when it is allowed to make it's own development policies. Then Multi-media technol - ogy will thrive in Africa, releasing it's many benefits, including the benefit of lasting peace.
