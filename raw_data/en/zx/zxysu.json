Rhodonite: Treats auto-immune diseases, balances and regenerates cells. Moss Agate: A cleansing stone that refreshes and boosts the immune system. Labradorite: Regulates metabolism and treats infection. Carnelian: Fires up the body's defence mechanisms by improving absorption of vitamins and minerals. How to Use this Set Each crystal set is cleansed before despatched but it is a good idea to cleanse them with your energy. A [Sage Smudge Stick](https://spiritualearthcrystals.co.uk/product/californian-white-sage/) is ideal. To help connect with your crystal set, sit with them quietly gently moving them around your hand to feel their energy. There is no need to carry all four crystals each day, I suggest you go to them each morning and choose with which crystal(s) you are drawn to. Some days it may be all four and sometimes just one. The crystals will tell you what you need each day. Once you have made your decision carry your crystal(s) in your pocket for the day. Follow this procedure each day, as every day is different and your needs and energy will differ each day. "}
