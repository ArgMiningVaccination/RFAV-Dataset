CooneyAAEP News February 2020 III Beyond good intentions: The ethics of 'spotting' medications to colleagues By Nick Huggons, DVM, DACVS In-house pharmacies in a referral center are generally stocked with a more diverse range of prescription medica- tions due to the center's need to triage and treat a broad and varied caseload. Frequently, a referral center is contacted by an ambulatory veterinarian regarding a case that may not result in physical referral of the patient, yet requires treatment that includes prescription medications not typically stocked by the ambulatory veterinarian. For example, an ambulatory veterinarian with a limited number of reproductive cases attends a foal for their client and determines that it has failure of passive transfer. The client is not willing to refer at this time and the veterinarian does not have a supply of plasma and fluids to administer the foal; however, they need to administer these in a timely manner. A simple call into the local referral center locates a supply of frozen plasma and fluids that can be furnished. Being a newborn, the foal does not have patient status with the referral center, even if the center is familiar with the mare. There is no Veterinarian-Client-Patient Relationship (VCPR) estab- lished between the referral center and the foal. However, as has been common practice, the referral center discusses the case with the referring veterinarian and dispenses the much-needed plasma and intravenous fluids. What are the implications behind a local referral center in-house pharmacy dispensing a biologic (\"non-danger- ous\" or \"non-prescription\" drug) versus a controlled (\"prescription\" or \"dangerous\" drug) under these or similar circumstances? The answer depends on the product and each state's veterinary practice rules. Plasma is not a dangerous drug; it is a biological that, in my state of California, is regulated by the California Food and Agriculture Department. Section 9272(3) of the California Food and Agricultural Code (CFAC) exempts licensed private veterinarians who collect blood or blood products solely for use in their own practices from provisions of the act. Reselling the plasma, however, would place the clinic as a functioning blood bank in California with all of the attendant regulations. The exemptions are not broad enough to allow reselling of biologics under the current law without obtaining proper licensure. This would require a license pursuant to the CFAC Commercial Blood Banks for Animals and Biologics chapter 1.5. Further, the clinic would then be liable for potential negative reactions or diseases that could be transferred. If the drug is not a biologic and considered dangerous (\"federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription\"), there is nothing in the California Veterinary Medicine Practice Act to prohibit such activity. It is recognized as common practice to \"spot\" a colleague for drugs they require. However, the AVMA's Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics require a VCPR before a veterinarian can write a prescription for an animal patient. In addition, each state's veterinary medical board further regulates how prescriptions must be written. This, in turn, dictates that the rules will vary by state\u2014several states allow vet- erinarians to fill prescriptions from other veterinarians in certain scenarios while others do not. As a veterinarian dispensing drugs with a valid VCPR, the clinic is not regulated by the California Board of Pharmacy if it is not filling prescriptions for other veteri- narians' patients. Controlled drug transfers from one DEA-registered veterinarian to another DEA-registered veterinarians are permitted. This mandates records of the transfers by log entries and invoices for CIII-V drugs; in addition, CII drugs must be accompanied by DEA Form 222 issued by the recipient and completed by you with a copy to the DEA's local field office. The issue of reselling drugs becomes more complicated if significant quantities are being resold to other resellers; practitioners should avoid these scenarios. (All of this, however, is different than one DEA-registered veterinarian directly dispensing medications to another DEA-registered veterinarian's patient without the dispensing veterinarian maintaining a VCPR with said patient.) Check your own state's veterinary practice rules to avoid confusion on this issue. Biologics versus prescription drugs are likely to be covered under different licensing bodies within each state, and veterinarians must be aware of the nuances between biologic and prescription products that may be called upon by fellow practitioners.Dr. Nick Huggons Dr. Huggons is co-owner of San Luis Rey Equine Hospital in Bonsall, Calif., and a member of the AAEP's Professional Conduct and Ethics Committee.ETHICSASSoCIATI onIV AAEP News February 2020 ASSoCIATI on Reward excellence with an AAEP award nomination Deadline to nominate is June 1 1.

The guidelines are accessible on both the AAEP website and publications app. Although long eradicated in North America, Australia and Europe, recent outbreaks in countries in which Glanders was previously eradicated indicate that the disease is no longer as geographically restricted in terms of its global distribution. This re-emergence, according to guidelines co-author Dr. Abby Sage, underscores the importance of effective import control measures.\"Although Glanders was officially eradicated in the United States in 1934, it continues to be present in many countries throughout the world,\" said Dr. Sage, Richmond staff veterinarian for the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. \"We must remain vigilant through the USDA's strict testing of horses at points of entry into the U.S. to prevent re-introduction of this disease.\" Prompt identification, euthanasia and appropriate disposal of all positive cases of the disease is critical to effective prevention and control of Glanders. Although antibiotic treatment of affected animals is employed in some areas of the world where Glanders is endemic, it is not the accepted option for most countries when dealing with an outbreak. The Glanders Guidelines were co-authored for the AAEP's Infectious Disease Committee by Drs. Sage and Peter Timoney, the Frederick Van Lennep Chair in Equine Veterinary Science at the University of Kentucky's Gluck Equine Research Center.

In the EVE podcast episode, Dr. Solenn Le Corre discusses the paper \"Cor pulmonale secondary to pulmonary fibrosis in a 16-year-old mare.\" The paper is accessible at https://beva.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ eve.12986. The bottom line: Cor pulmonale is rarely observed in horses, and there is very little published information about prognosis and outcome of this cardiac remodelling over the long term. The treatment of the underlying cause is essential to prevent any worsening of the lesions that could lead to a global cardiac insufficiency.

The bottom line: Fracture configurations can be identified radiographically but is not a reliable predictor of commi- nution or other intra-articular lesions. Arthroscopy not only directs repair but also identifies and facilitates management of concurrent lesions. The results reported should assist in formulating appropriate prognoses for Thoroughbred horses racing in the UK. Listen to the 7-minute episode and subscribe to future episodes at evj.podbean.com.

Ted Fish, Ed.D., MBA, formerly with Footeworks, is executive director of the Gardner Carney Leadership Institute in Colorado Springs, Colo.Resolving conflict in a healthy way By Kevin Foote, LMSW and Ted Fish, Ed.D., MBA Everyone knows the story: Two doctors who know each other reasonably well start a company. They have similar financial goals. They are in parallel places in their careers. They are eager, ambitious, and they work their tails off\u2014 putting up with long hours, difficult clients and times when they're not sure how the bills are going to be paid. Somehow, they succeed. The books move from red to black to solidly profitable. Their reputations in the community grow. Associates are hired\u2014good doctors, who look to be interested in buying in. And then the train comes off the tracks. The minor things, the little annoyances that they always managed to tolerate in each other no longer appear small. Cracks threaten to become rifts. They can't stand meeting together. Maybe one micromanages everything the other does. Maybe one fixes the schedule so she doesn't have to be on call. Maybe one hoards the clients for himself or criticizes the other behind her back. The more each thinks about it, the more they begin to wonder how the two of them can co-exist. What can they do? The details of conflict vary from practice to practice. In some companies, owners are pitted against the staff. You simply can't get them to be thoughtful or accountable enough in their work. In other companies, the rift is with the associates. They say they work too hard, get paid too little, criticize everything you do. When conflict escalates, communication breaks down and a vicious cycle builds. Conflict is actually natural. People are different, and expressing different needs and different points of view is one of the signs of a healthy company. But when conflict reaches the point where it is causing high blood pressure, migraines, self-medication, or that feeling of dread whenever you think of seeing that person at work; when it reaches the point that it becomes an elephant in the room, drawing energy away from the board, doctor or staff meeting, then it has become dangerous. Unless it is dealt with, the conflict will create harm for your organization and your health. Imagine a clinic where instead of joining together to take on the competition, doctors are taking out each other. Imagine a bunch of football players, who as soon as the whistle blows, tackle each other instead of the opposite team! Wouldn't you love to take on a team like that for market share? Unfortunately, this scenario is all too common in equine practices. When conflict escalates beyond what can be managed, a third party is needed. The person has to come from the outside. The antagonists are in a tug-of-war, and there's too much pressure on the rope. Anything anybody says is a reason to pull in the opposite direction. What the profes- sional does is listen to each of the sides, and then once the rapport has been built, they demand that both stop tugging the line. The professional interrupts the pattern of conflict and helps each walk to the other's position, to see how life looks from where that person stands. The purpose is not to persuade anyone of anything but to listen and understand. Many times, people just want to be heard. Then, new agreements can be crafted from common ground. This is not a novel skill. All of us do this all the time\u2014in our marriages and in relationships where we are invested. We have to remember that our professional relationships are a vehicle. They are not marriages. They are not until death do you part. But if we can become invested in a shared vision, it can give us reason to commit ourselves in a relationship of professional respect. When I go to organizations full of conflict, I usually find that the people are getting a bad rap. Escalating tensions often arise from systems failures. People need support. Type A personalities\u2014high achievers who are used to being the best\u2014need to know when something is their business and when it is not. Setting clear chains of command along with systems of accountability, like monthly meetings, financial reports, and appropriate checks and balances, help capable people stay out of each other's yards.Kevin Foote ...if we can become invested in a shared vision, it can give us reason to commit ourselves in a relationship of professional respect. continued on next pageResolving conflict in a healthy way, continued Healthy organizations establish working channels of com- munication in well-run meetings with fixed agendas. They carefully attend to their young and old, making equitable and transparent plans that guide buy-ins and buyouts, so the next person in line feels safe and eager to play. Healthy organizations invest in culture. When conflict is acute and hazardous, the pressure must be taken off. Ultimately, however, the key to conflict resolution is a system that supports long-range relationships and long-term health.Keys to handle the conflict: Bring in an objective third party to let the pressure off the system. Instead of tugging in a war, reduce the tension by joining their vantage point. Craft a shared vision about where you are going. Invest in the long-term health of your company by establishing clear governance structures, checks and balances, and meetings that encourage open communication.WELL nESSAAEP News February 2020 IX Banfield releases suicide-prevention training as a free resource Banfield Pet Hospital has made its suicide-prevention training, \"ASK - Assess, Support, Know,\" available as a free resource to the veterinary profession. The first of its kind, Banfield designed ASK specifically for veterinary professionals to help them recognize and address emotional distress and suicidal thoughts. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2015) one in six veterinarians considers suicide. Further, the CDC found rates of suicide are 2.1 times higher than the general population among male veterinarians and 3.5 times higher for female veterinarians. You can access ASK at ASKAssessSupportKnow.com. The training includes real-life scenarios, talking points, myth-busting and other resources to help guide veterinary professionals in navigating tough situations.

Dipyrone is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; however, it is not one of the seven quantitatively restricted NSAIDs currently addressed by USEF Equine Drugs and Medications Rules. As such, it is a prohibited substance, but GR411 (Conditions for Therapeutic Administrations of Prohibited Substances) will apply. Effective immediately, any use of Zimeta will require a properly filed medication report form documenting a 24-hour withdrawal. Additionally, the administration of dipyrone will not constitute the use of a second NSAID, which is prohibited by USEF rules. For more information, contact the USEF Equine Drugs and Medications Program at (800) 633-2472.

Effective March 2020: No more than one NSAID may be administered. Stacking of NSAIDS is prohibited; and Bronchodilators (Clenbuterol, Albuterol and all other bronchodilators) are prohibited substances and may not be administered.No medication may be administered 24 hours prior to a horse's performance in an under-tack show. The schedule for administration of permitted medication at Keeneland's April Two-Year-Olds in Training Sale will be governed by the rules of racing as set forth by the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission. For more, visit https://tinyurl.com/tbred2020.At its December meeting in Tucson, Ariz., the Association of Racing Commissioners International (ARCI) approved 10 amendments to its model rules for racing, including updates to rules pertaining to use of non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), bisphosphonates and intra-articular injections. Board-approved model rule amendments prohibit: Administration of NSAIDs within 48 hours of a race Any horse from racing in flat or jump racing within 14 days after receiving an intra-articular injection, and stacking is prohibited Use of bisphosphonates in any horse younger than four, and the bisphosphonates must be FDA- approved, administered according to instructions and only used to treat navicular disease Chemical or immunocastration Among other revisions, the board also approved signifi- cantly increased penalties for \"doping\" and \"equine endangerment\" violations pending further work by the Drug Testing Standards and Practices Committee, which is to present final recommendations in advance of ARCI's board meeting in April.

Following a review of medical records, preoperative radiographic and scintigraphic images were evaluated withgrading scales. Follow-up was obtained with a telephonequestionnaire. Prognostic value the number of affectedinterspinous spaces, radiographic grading and scintigraphicgrading was tested by using a chi-squared test. A median follow-up of 35 months was available for 56 horses. Fifty-one of 56 (91.1%) horses returned to some level ofperformance, with 27/51 (52.9%) horses achieving anequivalent or higher level of performance. Achieving a lowerlevel of performance was attributed to recurrent back pain in9/24 (37.5%) horses and to unassociated lameness in 9/24(37.5%) horses. Owners of 44/56 (78.6%) horses were satis ed with the post-operative performance level, and owners of 46/56 (82.1%) horses would recommend the procedure. None ofthe variables tested in fluenced the return to performance. Interspinous ligament desmotomy allowed horses with ORDSP to return to some level of performance, althoughfewer returned to an equivalent or higher level ofperformance than had previously been reported. Testing for PPID and insulin dysregulation In this study, Remona Horn and Franc /C223ois-Ren /C19e Bertin from the University of Queensland, Australia, evaluated combinedtesting to simultaneously diagnose pituitary pars intermediadysfunction (PPID) and insulin dysregulation (ID) in horses. The thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test and the two-step insulin sensitivity test are commonly usedmethods to diagnose, respectively, PPID and ID. This studyinvestigated the diagnostic value of combining these twotests to diagnose PPID and ID simultaneously. This randomised prospective study included 27 adult horses, 10 control horses without PPID or ID, ve horses with PPID only, ve horses with ID only and seven horses with PPID and ID. Horses underwent a TRH stimulation test alone, a two-step insulin sensitivity test alone, and combined testing withsimultaneous TRH and insulin injection in the same syringe.Data were compared by two-way repeated measuresanalysis of variance and two one-sided tests to demonstrateequivalence. Bland -Altman plots were generated to visualise agreement between combined and independent testing. The effect of combined testing on plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone, blood glucose concentration orpercentage decrease in blood glucose concentration was notsigni cantly different from the effect obtained with independent testing. One control horse appeared falselypositive for PPID, two PPID-only horses appeared falsely positivefor ID and one PPID and ID horse appeared falsely negative forID when tests were performed simultaneously. Bland -Altmanplots supported the agreement between combined andindependent testing. Combining the TRH stimulation test and the two-step insulin sensitivity test appears to be a useful diagnostic tool forequine practitioners in the eld, allowing simultaneous testing of a horse for both PPID and ID. Stimulation of subchondral bone cyst healing In this study, Lance Frazer and colleagues in the United Statesaimed to predict the bone formation stimulus of atranscondylar screw across an equine a 2 cm 3SBC under several transcondylar screw conditions was performed. The FEM was derived from computed tomography of the right sti fle of a yearling Thoroughbred without sti fle disease that had been subjected to euthanasia for reasons unrelatedto this study. The transcondylar screw was modelled as a 4.5-mm stainless steel cylinder. The region of interest was thecentrodistal MFC, and bone stimulus was calculated. Thestimulus threshold for bone formation (BFT) was >60 MPa, presented as the percentage of total bone surface area(BFA) and frontal plane maps. Principal compressive stressvectors were also determined. Tested variables were dailycycles, load, and screw compression and position. At 750 cycles and 900-N load, <3% of the BFA exceeded the BFT. Increases in BFA >BFT occurred proportionally with load, screw compression and daily cycles (steps).Compressive stress was oriented vertically on the SBC surfacewithout a screw but aligned with the long axis of well-placedlag screws. Screw placement through the void also increasedthe number and magnitude of compressive vectors. This model predicted that a transcondylar lag screw across an MFC SBC increased surface BFA stimulation andreoriented the compression vector. Increasing screwcompression, load and steps per day increased the boneformation stimulus. This study provides evidence that supportsthe use of a lag screw through an MFC SBC to promote boneformation. Intra-articular injection of antimicrobials This knowledge summary by Helen Braid from the University ofLiverpool, UK, considers the PICO question 'In horses, does treatment with intra-articular antimicrobials concurrently withintra-articular corticosteroids reduce the risk of iatrogenicsynovial to corticosteroidsalone? ' Antimicrobials such as amikacin sulphate often added to corticosteroid preparations whenperforming intra-articular injections in horses. This summaryconsiders whether the risk of iatrogenic synovial sepsisincreases in the absence of these antimicrobials and whetherinjecting them concurrently with corticosteroids is necessary. Three studies were examined, two of which directly evaluated the prevalence of iatrogenic synovial sepsisfollowing intra-articular injection. Two of the 10.1111/eve.13242retrospective analyses of medical records, and one was asurvey-based study with retrospective analyses of medicalrecords submitted in response to a questionnaire. In this literature, the author found there was no evidence showing that intra-articular injection of antibiotics inconjunction with corticosteroids reduces the risk of synovialsepsis. However, the intra-articular injection of polysulphatedglycosaminoglycans (PSGAGs) in combination withcorticosteroids was noted as a risk factor for developingiatrogenic synovial sepsis and therefore concurrent antibioticinjection when administering PSGAGs may be warranted. Thereported frequency of infection following intra-articularinjections was very low (0.02 -0.08%). An overall prevalence of iatrogenic synovial sepsis following all intra-articular injectionsbased on data from all included studies was calculated as0.02%. However, due to the paucity of literature on the topic,further studies are required in this eld to determine more accurate clinical recommendations. Atrial brillation This retrospective case series by Ingrid Vernemmen andcolleagues in Belgium investigated whether a high atrialpremature depolarisation (APD) burden after cardioversion isassociated with recurrence of atrial brillation (AF). Medical records were searched for horses that successfully underwent transvenous electrical cardioversion (TVEC) for AFbetween 2008 and 2017. Horses were included in the study ifthey met the following inclusion criteria: it was theirrst episode of AF, there was no AF recurrence in the rst 5 days post-cardioversion, 24-h ECG recording andechocardiographic examination 5 days post-cardioversionwere available, no antiarrhythmic treatment was administeredduring the 24-h ECG recording and follow-up information wasavailable for at least 1 year. An APD was de ned as a premature P-wave, occurring at least 8% earlier, with a normalor abnormal morphology and, if conducted to the ventricles,followed by a QRS-complex with a normal morphology. Eighty horses met the inclusion criteria, 33% of which (n = 26) experienced AF recurrence within 1 year, with a mediantime to recurrence of 125 days. Horses experiencingrecurrence within 1 year showed a signi cantly higher number (median [range]) of APDs non-recurrence (7 multivariable model, 25 APDs/24 h, mitral regurgitation, left atrial active fractional area change and lower bodyweight wassigni cantly associated with AF recurrence. These results indicate that the APD burden 5 days post- cardioversion could be a useful predictive value for AFrecurrence within 1 year in horses. Calcaneal bursae sepsis This the UK-based cohort study by Cajsa Isgren andcolleagues reports the outcome of horses withcontamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursae followingendoscopic treatment in addition to identifying prognosticfactors associated with survival.Medical records from seven referral hospitals in the UK were reviewed to identify horses that presented with synovialcontamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursae between 2002and 2016. A total of 128 horses were included in the study;123 of which recovered from anaesthesia. Following surgery,clinical signs improved in 74.8% (n =92) of cases. Twenty-one horses underwent a second surgery. Both the calcanealbursa and the subcutaneous bursa were affected in 42.5% (n=54) of horses, and in 48.0% (n =61) only the calcaneal bursa was affected. All horses with only the subcutaneousbursa involvement survived. There was bone involvement in23.6% (n =30) of horses. The most common bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus spp., followed by Streptococcus spp. and Escherichia coli . Administration of systemic antimicrobials prior to referral was associated with reduced mortality. Bone fracture/osteomyelitis, tendon involvement, duration of generalanaesthesia, post-operative synoviocentesis were 87.1% were alive, 7.1% calcaneal injury and 5.7% hadbeen euthanised for unrelated reasons. From 57 horses withathletic performance follow-up, 91.2% returned to the sameor higher level of exercise. Endoscopic treatment of calcaneal bursae contamination/sepsis in horses has a good survival rate withthe majority of horses returning to their previous athletic useat the same or higher level. S.

J. of print. https://doi.org/10.1111/evj.13186. \u00a92019 EDUCATION / AE Equine welfare It is generally accepted that equines bene t from their association with man. Their use is bene cial. Their abuse is not. Similarly, stress is largely bene cial, but distress is to be avoided. The welfare of all animals has become increasinglytopical. This varies from public rejection of animalexperimentation, through factory farming, to the stressesimposed by long journeys, often under deplorable conditionswith little, if any, food and water which many horses (andother animals) must endure on their nal travels mostly from Eastern Europe or from South America, to the slaughterhouses in Belgium, France and Italy. There is no problem ineating horse meat to meet the demand but there can belittle justi cation for not slaughtering them (and other animals) close to home and so avoid these horrendous journeys. Itwould be in nitely preferable to have them transported 'on the hook 'rather than 'on the hoof '. Let's look at the developing world. Several UK based equine charities, in addition to their national work, alsooperate internationally. World Horse Welfare, for example runspractical training programmes in some of the world 's poorest countries, often in conjunction with other welfare charitiesand always in partnership with local organisations andgovernments to ensure that their impact is sustainable, tocombat the major causes of equine suffering and therebyhelping the owners to help themselves. The aim is to improvethe well-being of the equine, be it horse, mule or donkey andthus improve its working capacity to the bene t of its owner and his/her family. World Horse Welfare believes in usinglocally available materials to establish sustainable andpermanent solutions to problems in the world where needed. In saying this we must always remember the hugely varied culture between countries. Religions, history, tribal rivalries,acute poverty and extreme wealth can all in fluence attitudes to animals and in some countries the concept of 'animal rights 'or even 'animal welfare 'may not be recognised. At home, in the sport horse world, both in racing and in the competition arena, the specialist equestrian press publisheswhat they see. It is up to us to ensure that what they see isacceptable. A smile and a pat on the neck are in nitely preferable to a scowl and a jab on the reins from a riderfollowing an unsuccessful round. In racing, the sight of a horsebeing ridden out to obtain maximum placing, encouraged bythe jockey 's hands and heels and maybe a slap down the shoulder is surely preferable to the image of raised whips,flapping reins, with the jockey often seen to be bumping in the saddle. Regardless, this surpasses visions from the past of horsesbeing truly beaten, particularly in long distance steeplechasesand in heavy ground when they are exhausted and can barelyraise a canter. In many countries, but not all, the whips arenow made with softer materials, which cause little or anydiscomfort. However, this image does not escape theperception of in flicting pain and injury on the horse, sadly. In the recent past, the winner of the Gold Cup, the major race inthe capital city of an African country, could be found 2 yearslater, lame and emaciated, pulling a cart full of rubbish -what a fall from grace to be discarded by its callous owner, when its racing days and fame were over.If we look back to 1992 there were the three fatal falls during the cross-country phase of Badminton 's, UK, 3-day-event, next there was NBC 's one-sided coverage of the 3-day-event at the Olympic Games in Barcelona, whichappeared to concentrate primarily on horses falling andwhich caused subsequent media and public outrage. Thenthere was the fatal injury sustained by the 8-year-old gelding,Sir Arkay, when he broke a hind leg on the steep, newly built,bank at Wembley (jumping) Stadium in London, UK andnally Mr Brook 's broken leg in the six-furlong Sprint at the Breeders Cup in Hallandale, Florida. This is not to mention theUSA 's Sports Illustrated story of fraud, whereby horses were killed to claim the insurance money. None of this did muchgood for the image of equestrian sport. To add insult to injury, Animals International, the publication for the World Society for the Protection ofAnimals, in its winter edition of 1992, grouped togetherphotographs and accompanying texts of: Clubbing seals to death in Canada; Bear-baiting using bull terriers in Pakistan A horse falling at the 3-day-event at the Olympic Gamesin Barcelona, Spain. The caption referring to the latter read 'Cross country cruelty at the Olympics 'and went on to state how horses collapsed from exhaustion and numerous horses were withdrawn oreliminated due to fatigue. In fact, according to the FEI 'sA n n u a l Report of 1992, 82 horses representing 18 countries took part inthe 3-day-event at the Barcelona Olympic Games, 72 horsescompleted the endurance phase including all 18 teams and 62horses completed the whole event including 15 teams. Onlytwo horses, two too many, presented symptoms of extremeexhaustion, both of which fully recovered thanks to excellentveterinary care. The report concluded: 'This has to be the most satisfactory result in the history of the Olympic Games3-day-event 'and had certainly nothing to do with 'cross country cruelty 'as alleged by Animals International. Resulting from such incidences and to tackle the issues concerned, the FEI, in conjunction with World Horse Welfarereacted by: Forming an Ethics Committee to investigate and monitorwelfare issues in equestrian sport, perceived or otherwise; Producing a Code of Conduct for the Welfare of the Horsewhich was widely circulated in many languages and wasupdated on a regular basis and published in eventschedules and programmes worldwide; Appointing an Honorary Chief Steward, to liaise with andoversee national stewards in its member nationalfederations to standardise the role of stewards in the eld; Introducing Warning Cards (as in football) to be issuedwhen horses are seen to be abused or when of cials are either verbally or physically assaulted. What were the main areas of concern in the different disciplines? Jumping: primarily wear and tear, locomotion problems,pain 10.1111/eve.13056Dressage: competition was not considered asstressful as jumping although the indications were that training methods may well bemore so(e.g. Rollkur/Hyper flexion), particularly ininexperienced hands; Eventing: tragic deaths ofboth horses and riders resulted in considerable emphasis being placed onimproving safety measures. Most rider deaths had been caused byslow somersaults and proposals were considered astohow to modify various elements ofthe discipline, hence, Three Day Eventing became Eventing following the removal of the steeplechase and the two roads and tracks, prior to intheMiddle East. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) led this discipline inthe Middle East. It promoted and encouraged other countries inthe region toorganise rides. These countries saw the UAE riders on good, expensive horses travelling much faster than theythemselves could ever hope toreplicate. They considered this tobethe norm and this inevitably resulted inover- ridden and exhausted horses orworse, but often without having sufciently experienced veterinary expertise to cope and care forthese horses after the ride. Itwas considered essential toeffectively monitor this discipline very carefully asitcontinues togrow, often incountries with little concern thedemands on thehorse were notconsidered excessive and nospeci c welfare problems were known, other than thecontinuous circle onone rein.

Tomlinson Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University; andBaker Institute for Animal Health, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, disease (equine serum hepatitis) was initially (Theiler 1918). Theiler hadadministered and antiserum to 1148 adult horses as prophylaxisduring an AHS outbreak in South Africa. Four to 12 weeksfollowing administration of the antiserum, an epidemic offulminant hepatic failure occurred in 27 horses that hadreceived the antiserum. Twenty-two of the 27 horses withhepatitis died (case fatality rate 81.5%). Theiler also reportedthat four horses that had not received antiserum but were incontact with inoculated horses died with what appeared tobe an identical disease, suggesting that a transmissible andcontagious pathogen could be responsible for the disease. Inthe United States (US) during the pandemic of westernequine encephalomyelitis (WEE) that began in 1930, ndings like those reported by Theiler occurred when pooled equine-origin WEE antiserum was administered to 9193 horses asprophylaxis against WEE infection (Marsh 1937). In that study,90 cases of liver failure occurred within 12 weeks followingadministration of the antiserum, with 90% of cases occurring40-70 days after the antiserum inoculation. Seventy-nine (87.8%) of the clinically affected horses died within 24 h afterexhibiting neurological signs (hepatic encephalopathy) andjaundice. There are similar outbreaks of hepatic failurereported in Europe following administration of equineantiserum for anthrax or equine in fluenza (Slagsvold 1938; Thomsett 1971). In the two latter outbreaks, the percentageof horses developing liver failure following serum inoculationwas low and similar to that previously reported in both theSouth Africa and US outbreaks. The case fatality rates in thesefour large outbreaks were all very high with deaths mostcommonly occurring within 1 -5 days following onset of clinical signs. In the last four decades, Theiler 's disease reports have been predominantly limited to scattered case reports withint h eU Sa n dt w or e c e n tc a s es e r i e s( T o m l i n s o n et al. 2018a,b). Reported cases have been most commonly associated withequine-origin tetanus anti toxin (TAT) administration 40 -90 days earlier, and a small number of cases have occurred followingequine plasma administration (Messer and Johnson 1994;Aleman et al. 2005). Cases with no history of equine-origin biologic product administration have also been reported(Tomlinson 2018b). All reported cases of Theiler 's disease have been in horses that were at least 1 year of age.Consistent post-mortem nding among horses that have died of Theiler 's disease includes a collapsed, smaller-than-normal liver, with microscopic ndings of acute massive A mild-to-moderate frequently seen in the periportal regionof the liver (Robinson et al. 1975). Alzheimer type II cells characteristic of hyperammonaemia are frequently observedupon microscopic examination of the brain (Tomlinson et al. 2018a,b). Horses that survive Theiler 's disease are generally improved within 4 -10 days after onset of clinical signs, and those horses seem to have complete clinical recovery fromthe disease. To our knowledge, there are no reports of horsesthat survive Theiler 's disease and then have chronic liver failure later in life. In 1995, Guglick reported on two horses with fulminant Theiler 's disease and ve horses from the same farm with subclinical hepatitis, all following administration ofTAT 7 and 8 weeks earlier (Guglick et al. 1995). This report indicated that both clinical hepatitis and subclinical hepatitiscan occur with Theiler 's disease. A summary of these prior publications on Theiler 's disease suggests the following: (i) clinical hepatitis followingadministration of an equine-origin biologic product is notcommon, but when clinical disease occurs, it is oftenfulminant with onset of clinical signs most commonly4-12 weeks following inoculation with an equine-origin blood product; (ii) biologic products produced from pooled serummight carry a greater risk than single-source blood products;(iii) subclinical hepatitis can also occur in equine-origin biologic products; (iv) horses in contactwith inoculated and diseased horses can develop acutehepatic disease, suggesting that the disease could be bothinfectious and contagious. Since 2012, four new viruses that infect horses (three RNA viruses and one DNA virus) have been investigated usingunbiased ampli cation and high-throughput sequencing of serum and tissue samples from horses. Two of the RNA virusesfrom the pegivirus family, equine pegivirus and Theiler 's disease-associated virus (TDAV), are not thought to behepatotropic and do not cause liver disease in horses(Chandriani et al . 2013; Kapoor et al. 2013). Theiler 's disease- associated virus was discovered during the investigation ofTheiler 's disease outbreak on a single farm, which occurred after administration of equine-origin botulinum antitoxin tohorses. In that study, only RNA viral metagenomics analysiswas performed (Chandriani et al. 2013). Equine pegivirus is a very common infection in horses, while TDAV is uncommon. The third recently discovered RNA virus (non-primate hepacivirus [NPHV], also called equine hepacivirus causes mild, hepatic disease in horses (Burbeloet al. 2012; Pfaender et al. 2015; Scheel et al. 2015). An immune response to the virus is thought to be associated withthe hepatitis (Pfaender et al. 2015; Ramsay et al. 2015; Scheel et al. 2015). Although some horses remain persistently infected with this virus, there is no substantial evidence ofchronic liver disease in association with a chronic infection. \u00a92019 10.1111/eve.13053The latest virus of the recently investigated group of viruses is a DNA virus named equine parvovirus-hepatitis(EqPV-H) (Divers et al. 2018). This virus is hepatotropic and produces both clinical and subclinical disease in horses. In arecent prospective study on Theiler 's disease, EqPV-H was found in the serum and/or liver of 18 consecutive cases ofTheiler 's disease that occurred 4 -12 weeks following administration of an equine-origin biologic product, withtetanus antitoxin being the most common product administered(Tomlinson et al. 2018a). In 11 of those cases, either the exact biologic product administered to the Theiler 's disease case or the same lot number of the product was available for testing,and all were PCR-positive for EqPV-H. An experimentalinfection study had previously con rmed transmission of EqPV- H from a PCR-positive biologic product to seronegativehorses, proving that transmissible virus (EqPV-H) is present insome biologic products in the US (Divers et al. 2018). That study also retrospectively tested stored frozen samples (caseserum and antitoxin product) from the farm outbreak whereTDAV had been discovered and found that all samples werealso positive for EqPV-H. Although recent publications demonstrate a strong association of EqPV-H with Theiler 's disease, additional studies are needed to further con rm EqPV-H as the cause of Theiler 's disease. Because the horse in the case report by Kopper et al. (2020) was infected with both EqPV-H and NPHV, one mightwonder if a co-infection was responsible for the disease in thathorse. While co-infection could play a role in the disease, arecently published article found that NPHV infection is rare ineld cases of Theiler 's disease (Tomlinson et al. 2018a). Additional EqPV-H studies are required to understand themechanism of the hepatic disease. In experimental EqPV-Hinfections, the onset of biochemical disease correlated withboth the time of peak viraemia and initial antibody detection(Divers et al. 2018). It would appear that 4 -12 weeks are necessary for these events to occur. The lymphocytic in ltrate often found histologically in the periportal areas may suggestan acute immune reaction, possibly involving cytotoxiclymphocytes, towards the virus-laden hepatocytes (Diverset al. 2018). Cases of Theiler 's disease not associated with the recent administration of an equine-origin biologic product arereported, and these cases also have a strong association withEqPV-H infection (Tomlinson et al. 2018b). Although the method of EqPV-H transmission in the 'non-biologic 'cases is unknown, it was recently reported that non-biologic casesoccur between late spring and late fall, suggesting thepossibility of insect spread of the virus, but this is currentlyunproven (Tomlinson et al. 2018b). Infection (EqPV-H) prevalence studies are scarce, but PCR testing has detected viral nucleic acid in horses residing inmany US states and in China, and prevalence can be highlyvariable between farms in the same geographic region (Luet al. 2018). Chronic EqPV-H infections appear to be common, and therefore, one might expect EqPV-H infection prevalence to increase with age. One study testing arandom set of serum samples from presumably healthy horsesreported an EqPV-H nucleic acid prevalence of 13%, and allvirus-positive samples also contained antibody against EqPV-H, suggesting that none were acute infections (Divers et al. 2018). All of the EqPV-H-positive horse serum samples in thatstudy had normal gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) values,but it is plausible that these horses might have previouslyexperienced a subclinical, transient liver disease 4 -12 weeksafter EqPV-H infection followed by resolution of the hepatitisand persistence of infection. High viral prevalence in somepopulations of horses might create a diagnostic dilemmawhen a horse is found to have both liver disease and is PCR-positive for EqPV-H in serum or liver. In those cases, serialserum qPCR testing for EqPV-H could be helpful indetermining the signi cance of the viral infection as a substantial decline in viraemia might be expected during thetime of active hepatitis caused by EqPV-H. Currently, the USDA is working to eliminate both EqPV-H and NPHV from commercial blood products. In themeantime, we would agree with Kopper et al. (2020) that if there is an urgent need for administration of an untestedequine-origin blood product to an adult horse, it should beadministered since the incidence of Theiler 's disease is low. On the other hand, routine administration of untested equine-origin blood products, especially those that are sourced frommultiple animals and then pooled, should be administeredonly after careful consideration.

The hoof was bandaged after debridement, and thereafter, the defect was cleaned daily with a0.9% saline solution and re-dressed. Ten days noted in thedegree oflameness. Three weeks after initial debridement, the solar defects were lling inwell with healthy looking, keratinising granulation tissue. However, some appeared tobe present deep tothe granulating wound, and onfurther exploration, itwas clear that further radical debridement and hoof wall resection were necessary (Fig5).After performing anabaxial sesamoid nerve block and applying atourniquet, the hoof wall was resected around the toe and lateral aspect ofthehoof upto1cmfrom thecoronary band. The abnormal black tissue deep tothe hoof wall was further debrided and submitted forhistopathology. Itwas, however, not possible toreach the fullextent ofthe abnormal tissue without removing the entire hoof wall uptothe coronary band. Discoloured tissue was medial and dorsal aspects ofthe sole inallthe areas that had been previously debrided. The option of using intralesional cisplatin was discussed atthis time totryto improve theprognosis forthisanimal. The authors, however, decided that intralesional treatment with cisplatin within the hoof capsule was likely toresult insevere inflammation and further compromise tothe integrity ofthe lamellae.

Despite this attempt atstabilisation and treatment with phenylbutazone (2.2 mg/kg bwt q.8h)(EqZona2),themule remained severely lame. Four weeks after wall resection and 8weeks after presentation, the mule continued toshow no improvement incomfort level. Discussions with the owner were initiated tointroduce the prospect ofeuthanasia on humane grounds. InMorocco, the economic value ofa good mule toitsowner cannot beoverestimated. Mules are used toplough elds, harvest and thresh corn and to transport goods tomarket. The lossofamule can represent aneconomic catastrophe, and therefore, euthanasia isan option that israrely accepted readily. Several weeks of negotiation were required before the owner could accept thepoor prognosis atwhich point theanimal was areas (Fig6).No other evidence ofdiscoloured tissue was found inany other organ system despite apost-mortem examination ofallinternal organs and skinorinany other region ofthelimb.

In contrast, thepresent case showed a discolouration of the white line butno draining tract. The lesion was localised andnonencapsulated. No metastases were evident post-mortemand the histopathology reported characteristics typical of abenign melanocytoma. Current thinking, however, is that allmelanomas in horses and probably other equids arepotentially malignant, although in grey horses, they may bequiescent for some considerable time (Moore et al. 2013). In this case, the local in ltration seems to extend into the bone and this can be construed as malignant behaviour. Cutaneous melanocytic tumours have been classi ed by Valentine (1995) into four clinical syndromes, some of whichmay or may not present a spectrum of pathology. These areas follows:1 Melanocytic naevus or melanocytoma is more often found in younger horses which may be grey or non-greyand which are localised and nonencapsulated. They areconsidered benign and signi cant a withheavy melanin pigmentation. 2 Discrete dermal melanoma is generally found in older grey horses with single nodules in predilection sites. These mayhave a high-mitotic rate but are considered benign whilsthaving the potential for malignancy. Histopathologically,they have a variable mitotic index and they may be moreor less pigmented. 3 Dermal melanomatosis may represent a spectrum of the disorder which starts as a discrete dermal melanoma andprogresses to involve multiple and coalescent nodules.They are associated with the development of visceralmetastasis; but histologically, they are indistinguishablefrom discrete dermal melanomas. 4 Malignant melanoma generally affects middle aged to older horses of grey or non-grey colour. These tumourshave a high-mitotic index and show aggressivewidespread metastatic behaviour. The case reported here had a bay coat colour, had only asingle lesion in a nontypical location, and showed nodetectable evidence of metastatic activity. Onhistopathology, no mitotic activity was reported and thetissue was heavily pigmented and therefore was consideredto be well differentiated. All these features are suggestive ofa benign melanocytoma and are consistent with Valentine(1995) description of this classi cation. As previously mentioned, however, post-mortem examination showedsome evidence of in ltration of the third phalanx which would not normally be consistent with a benign tumour. Theeffect of tumour proliferation within the con nes of a hoof capsule being constrained by the hoof wall and theunderlying bone might cause signi cant compromise to one or both of these structures. It is possible that the invasion ofthe pedal bone by the tumour represented pressure necrosisof the bone and tumour invasion at the same time. This mighthave been at least a part of the pain associated with thetumour. This would be an unusual event for a benign tumourof this type, but the location of the tumour and its extentsuggests that it can arise and again such a circumstance hasnot to our knowledge been reported. This case was unusual not only in the location of the tumour and the coat colour but also the species. Only tworeports of melanomas in mules exist in the literature. The studyreported by Valentine 1995 related to 53 horses. In 2009, 20horses with melanomas were reviewed by Sch \u20aconiger and Summers (2009). None of these case series included any mulesor donkeys. Both previous mule reports refer to single cases ofmalignant melanoma in grey mules (Diez 1973; Guiffre et al. 1995). Melanoma appears to be rarer still in donkeys, althougha single case of a malignant melanoma in a grey donkey hasrecently been reported (Mosbah and Awadin 2017). A recentsurvey of neoplasia in 125 donkeys reported only three of 125animals had melanomas (Davis et al. 2016); none of these were found in the 'usual 'equine predilection sites. The Donkey Sanctuary necropsy study on 1444 aged donkeys reported nota single melanoma (Morrow et al. 2011). Additionally, only one donkey with a melanoma has ever been treated at theDonkey Sanctuary in the last 10 years (A. Theiman, personalcommunication, 2017). Davis et al. (2016) noted that whilst sarcoid and some other skin tumours are relatively common indonkeys, melanoma is extremely rare and they speculatedthat melanoma in horses is possibly associated with anautosomal dominant trait that may have developed as anunintended consequence of human selection for colour. Theysuggest further that the rarity of melanoma in donkeys is aresult of the lack of any signi cant colour selection in this species. This case is the rst report of a benign melanocytoma in the hoof of any equid species. It has been suggested that extensive and complete resection of benign melanocytoma is curative (Knottenbelt2009), but despite repeated attempts at resection in thiscase, it was not possible to remove all of the affected tissue.The tumour showed very little localisation and invadedextensively between the hoof and the pedal bone. Previousreports of melanoma in the hoof describe treatment withaggressive surgical resection even including amputation ofthe entire distal limb (Floyd 2003) in a failed attempt tosalvage a valuable brood mare. The only other report in theliterature of treating a hoof melanoma described surgicalresection followed by intralesional treatment with cisplatin(Honnas et al. 1990). This approach appeared to slow tumour growth for a further 2 years after presentation atwhich point the tumour recurred and the horse wassubjected to euthanasia. Obviously, the breeding potentialof our animal was limited by the fact that it was a mule andits only value was as a working animal. Achieving 'pasture soundness 'would not, therefore, have constituted a success. Under the prevailing circumstances, there are considerablecultural, religious, economic and social constraints oneuthanasia, so whilst the delay could be seen as undue,due care had to be taken in making the nal decision acceptable. Chemotherapy with the use of cisplatin is relatively well supported by evidence in the literature and reduction intumour size can be expected, particularly where smalldiscrete nodules are involved. A study of 13 horses withdermal tumours treated intralesionally with cisplatinin reported a successrate of 81% (Theon et al. 2007). This approach was not considered to be a viable option in this case because (i) thematerial could not be effectively distributed and (ii) anyresulting in flammation within the hoof capsule would have further compromised the already affected laminae. Inaddition, cisplatin is a highly toxic compound with signi cant carcinogenic potential to humans; a risk bene t analysis, therefore, precluded the use of cisplatin in this case. \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd 69 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARYAuthors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Case Report Treatment of haemoperitoneum secondary to ruptured granulosacell tumours in two mares F. C. F. Worsman1*, S. Z. Barakzai2, M. P. de Bont3, S. Turnerand L. M. Rubio-Mart /C19nez Philip Leverhulme Equine Hospital, Institute of Veterinary Science, University of Liverpool, Leahurst, UK; andChine report cases of successful surgicalmanagement of granulosa cell tumours (GCT) in marespresenting with haemoperitoneum (HP). Controlledabdominal drainage was initially attempted in Case 1 butwas not successful. A ventral midline exploratory laparotomyallowed removal of a haemorrhaging 13 kg GCT. The maremade a full recovery and returned to normal work as adriving pony 11 months post-operatively. In Case 2 controlledabdominal drainage was followed by standing left flank laparoscopic visualisation of the bleeding ovary andtransection of the ovarian pedicle by electrocautery. The GCTwas then removed via a ventral midline incision due to itslarge size. Haemoperitoneum can be associated with GCTsand in some cases is severe enough to prompt emergencytreatment. Stabilisation of the patient and removal of thehaemorrhaging GCT can lead to a successful outcome. Introduction Haemoperitoneum (HP) is uncommon in horses (Dechantet al. 2006) and its investigation can be dif cult owing to the array of causes and the nature of their manifestation(Dechant et al. 2006; Conwell et al. 2010). Causes of HP in horses include splenic, hepatic or uterine rupture, broadligament haemorrhage, ovarian haematomas, or metastatic), rupture of mesentericarteries secondary to strongyle migration, as well as vascularleakage associated with the renal artery, ileocaecal arteryand aorta (Dechant et al. 2006; Conwell et Ovarian tumours account for 2.5% of all neoplasms in the horse (Sundberg et al. 1977) and granulosa cell tumour (GCT) is the most common neoplasm affecting the equine ovary(McCue et al. 2006). The most common clinical signs associated with ovarian GCTs are changes in behaviour,speci cally developing aggressive, stallion-like or nymphomania behaviour, infertility, anoestrous or colic(Crabtree 2011). It is uncommon that mares with GCTspresent with secondary HP, and only seven cases have beenpreviously reported in the literature (Green et al. 1988; Gatewood et al. 1990; Alexander et al. 2004; Dechant et al. 2006; Harper et al. 2010) with only ve of those surviving. This case report describes the clinical signs and management oftwo mares presenting with severe HP secondary to GCTswhich were successfully treated by ovariectomy. Case 1 details A 19-year-old (272 kg) Pony mare used for driving wasreferred with a history of abdominal distention, inappetance,dullness and lethargy of 1 month duration. The mare wasreported to have recently displayed abnormal oestrus cyclebehaviour. Clinical investigations On presentation at the hospital the mare was quiet, withmarked abdominal distention. She was tachycardic(96 beats/min) and had weak peripheral pulses. The rectaltemperature was lower than normal (36.2 \u00b0C). Mucous membranes were very pale with a capillary re ll time of 3 s. The mare 's peripheral blood packed cell volume was 11%, the red blood cell count was 2.05 910 12cells/L (reference range 6.8 -12.991012cells/L), total protein was and lactate -5.0 Hz 60 mm radius convex probe) revealed large areas of mixed echogenicity with a freeswirling appearance ( Fig 1 ) consistent with HP (Harper et al. 2010). A large mass of mixed echogenicity ( Fig 2 ) which had a multilocular 'honeycomb 'appearance typical of a GCT (White and Allen 1985) was identi ed. The mass was approximately 20 930 cm in size and was visible from both the left and right paralumbar fossae. Abdominocentesisyielded haemorrhagic fluid with a packed cell volume of 40%, a total protein of 56 g/L and total white blood cellcount 12 910 9cells/L which con rmed the presence of a HP. Per rectum examination was attempted but the mareresented the procedure. Following administration of hyoscinebutylbromide (0.3 mg/kg bwt i.v., Buscopan 2) to facilitate per rectum examination, the mare collapsed and thus perrectum examination was not completed. Emergency i.v. fluid resuscitation was initiated. The pony received a 10 L bolus of isotonic crystalloid solution(Aquapharm 11, solution for infusion, compound sodiumlactate i.v. infusion BP 3) and an allogenic blood transfusion of 8 L of fresh whole blood (not cross matched) from twohospital donor mares. The mare 's condition stabilised and she was standing again by approximately 10 min following fluid \u00a92018 The Authors Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley& Sons Ltd on behalf of British Equine Veterinary Association This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modi cations or adaptations doi: 10.1111/eve.12929and blood administration.

The abdominal cavity was lavaged with 15Lofsterile polyionic fluid, and asmuch fluid aspossible was then removed with suction post-lavage.

Case 2details A10-year-old Thoroughbred mare was presented for investigation ofincreasing abdominal distention which had been noted over the previous 4weeks. The mare was reported tobemore aggressive than usual but the owners were unsure ofany changes toher oestrus cycle. Clinical examination revealed anormal heart rate, rectal temperature and respiratory rate but poor body condition with anenlarged abdomen.

Drainage was discontinued when the flowrate todecrease toaslow drip; ultrasound examination was notrepeated. After a24-h period ofstarvation, the mare underwent laparoscopic laparoscope portal. The third (instrument) portal was made 10cm vertically below thelaparoscope portal. Allthree portal fashion (Lloyd etal.2007). A57cm long 10mm diameter 30\u00b0forward oblique viewing rigid laparoscope was introduced into theabdominal cavity.

Follow-up examination 6weeks post-operatively revealed suggest that rapid growth ofthe ovary may predispose to rupture of the ovarian capsule and haemorrhage however thecause isunclear. Both theGCTs in this report were large; however, GCTs ofsimilar size have been described intheliterature without associated bleeding etal.2007).

Increased neovascularisation inthe periphery ofatumour may beassociated thecapsular tear isunknown. Presentation and emergency stabilisation This report highlights the fact that GCTs may occasionally present with HPand, that insome cases, may require prompt medical resuscitation and emergency surgical intervention for asuccessful outcome, which, totheauthors 'knowledge, has notpreviously been reported. Given thesizeofthetumours in this case report, itislikely that they had been present for much longer than the time period that clinical signs had been noted bytheowners. These two cases presented with signs attributable tothe HPi.e.anaemia and abdominal distension, and Case 1also presented with collapse. Thiswas incontrast tothe typical behavioural signs that are more commonly present inmares with GCT, and which are attributable tothe hormonal imbalances associated with these tumours. Identifying thecause ofHPcan sometimes be challenging, butinboth cases inthisreport thepresence ofa very large, abnormal intra-abdominal mass was indicative of theinstigating cause ofhaemorrhage. Aprevious case described sub-acute associated with GCTs intwo mares (Alexander etal.2004). Surgical treatment was performed electively following medical stabilisation for 10-21days. Although this elective approach might bepreferred, intra- abdominal haemorrhage can berapid and severe insome cases, and can be successfully managed with prompt (arrow). / / FEBRUARYsurgical excision of bleeding GCTs. Acute emergency surgicalintervention was undertaken in Case 1 which presented withsevere anaemia and collapse because of the concern thatcontinued haemorrhage in an animal with an already lowpacked cell volume might result in fatal cardiovascularcompromise. Stabilisation of hypovolaemic cases secondary to HP can include allogenic or autogenous blood transfusions, fluid therapy and anti brinolytic agents such as aminocaproic acid. General guidelines for performing allogenic fresh wholeblood transfusions include typing both the donor andrecipient blood. Both major and minor cross matching isrecommended (Hart 2011), but this is dif cult in practice. Fresh blood was collected separately from two donor horsespre-surgery to be administered pre- and intraoperatively anda further collection was taken and administeredintraoperatively from a third donor horse. No cross matchingwas performed prior to the three fresh whole bloodtransfusions as discussed by Durham (1996). Ideally crossmatching should be performed for subsequent transfusionsafter the rst unmatched transfusion in an emergency (Hart 2011). Cross matching was performed post-operatively onCase 1 to identify suitable donors for any subsequentallogenic transfusions if required. Although in an emergencysituation unmatched fresh whole blood may be used for therst transfusion subsequent blood for transfusions should be cross matched to prevent transfusion reactions (Durham1996). The blood for transfusion was collected from hospitalteaching mares as these were the only donors available; it isrecommended that blood is taken from geldings to minimisereactions occurring (Sellon and Wise 2010). Autotransfusion ofabdominal blood collected from cases with HP has beendescribed (Waguespack et al. 2001; Finding et al. 2011; Fouch /C19eet al. 2014). However, it is contraindicated if the HP is associated with neoplasia (Finding et al. 2011) or on-going haemorrhage (Hart 2011), and intraperitoneal blood is timeconsuming to collect, therefore it may not be suitable forunstable cases requiring prompt surgical treatment (Case 1).HP has been reported to have a high association withneoplastic causes (Dechant et al. 2006; Conwell et al. 2010) and therefore, the sources of HP should be investigatedbefore autotransfusion is elected. In both cases a signi cant volume of HP was present, indicated by ultrasound ndings. A subjective estimate of between 5 and 10 L was made for Case 1 (bwt 272 kg)following ultrasound examination and approximately 9 L ofblood was obtained at surgery, but it is likely that more bloodwas present in the depths of the abdomen. In Case 2approximately 30 L of serosanguinous fluid was collected from the abdomen prior to laparoscopy. Drainage of the HPwas only partially effective in Case 2 and unsuccessful inCase 1, probably due to blood clots blocking the drainagecannula. If possible, controlled drainage is recommendedbefore general anaesthesia and exploratory laparotomy toimprove case stability and surgical visibility (Waguespacket al. 2001; Conwell et al. 2010; Finding et al. 2011). Treatment options The reported prognosis for survival following medicalmanagement of horses with HP is very variable (17 -84%, Pusterla et al. 2005; Dechant et al. 2006; Arnold et al. 2008; Conwell et al. 2010). In cases taken to surgery the source of haemorrhage was identi ed in 77.7% (Conwell et al. 2010).Dechant et al. (2006) reported a survival rate of 44.7% at the time of discharge following medical management of HPhowever no speci c treatment was signi cantly associated with survival. Supportive medical care may include i.v. fluid therapy, blood transfusions, nonsteroidal anti-in flammatories and al. 2010; Mudge 2014; Gray et al. 2015). Surgical removal of GCTs is the only solution available for treatment of the typical presentation of aggressive, stallion-like or nymphomania behaviour, infertility and anoestrous(McCue et al. 2006; Sherlock et al. 2016). Laparotomy (Crabtree 2011) and laparoscopy have both been reportedfor surgical of large, nonruptured GCTs (Rodgersonet al. 2002; de Bont et al. 2010). Laparoscopic techniques are currently favoured as they are minimally invasive and allowimproved visualisation of the ovarian pedicle for ligation(Hubert et al. 2006; Lloyd et al. 2007; de Bont et al. 2010), and standing laparoscopic ovariectomy is associated with a lowerpost-operative complication rate versus conventional surgeryin mares (Lloyd et al. 2007; de Bont et al. 2010; Sherlock et al. 2016). Laparoscopic transection of the ovarian pedicle wasperformed in Case 2 24 h after abdominal drainage, howevera signi cant volume of fluid was still present in the abdomen which impeded visualisation to a degree. Repeat abdominalultrasound examination following drainage and ideally on theday of surgery could have been performed in Case 2 togauge the remaining volume of HP. This would guide thesurgeon as to whether laparoscopic visualisation of theovarian pedicle was likely to be adequate or not. However, ifthe volume of HP is large or the case is unstable and thereforenot a suitable candidate for standing sedation (as in Case 1),laparoscopy is very unlikely to be successful and should steerthe surgical choice towards laparotomy. There are many choices for surgical ligation of thickened ovarian pedicles including bipolar electrocautery with orwithout suturing, stapling of the mesovarium and the use ofendoscopic clips (Doran et al. 1988; Lloyd et al. 2007; Smith and Mair 2008; de Bont et al. 2010; Kummer et al. 2010; Goodin et al. 2011). Whichever method is used, care must be taken that haemostasis is complete and secure. Surgical removal of GCTs using a two-step procedure (laparoscopic transection ventral midline laparotomy) has been reportedfor removal of very large ovaries (up to 50 cm in size) (Vitteet al. 2014), and this was the surgical method performed in Case 2. Retrieval of very large tumours via a ventral midlinelaparotomy may be advantageous over making a very largeflank laparotomy incision in a standing case and lessened post-operative complications (Vitte et al. 2014). However, there is the additional associated risk and cost of generalanaesthesia to consider. Alternatively, aspiration of the fluid contents of the mass or further dissection of enlarged ovarieswith a morcellator into smaller size pieces in a specimenretrieval bag via a flank incision has been reported (de Bont et al. 2010; Kummer et al. 2010), but we believe that this would not have been a realistic option in our two cases dueto the size of the ovaries. Prognosis There is a good prognosis following standing laparoscopicremoval of large, pathological ovaries and low complicationrates are reported: 99 -100% of cases are reported to return to their previous level of work and 85 -93% of cases are \u00a92018 The Authors Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley& Sons Ltd on behalf of British Equine Veterinary Association75 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARYsuccessfully bred within 30 months after surgery (Hubert et al. 2006; Lloyd et al. 2007; de Bont et al. et al. et al. 2011; Kelmer et al. 2013). Short-term survival rates for HP vary from 39 to 74% (Pusterla et al. 2005; Dechant et al. 2006; Conwell et al. 2010). Of the HP cases taken to surgery, a 42% survival rate has been reported (Conwell et al. 2010) and surgical treatment of GCTs associated with HP was curative inall cases (Alexander et al. 2004; Dechant et al. 2006). Conclusion In summary, GCTs should be considered as a differentialdiagnosis in mares presenting with HP. In some cases, theintra-abdominal haemorrhage is acute and severe and maynecessitate emergency resuscitation of the case. Medicalstabilisation of the case is initially recommended and surgicalremoval of the affected ovary is likely to result in a successfuloutcome.

C. Pressanto*, Beccati, V. Stefanetti, F. Passamonti, N. Pilatiand M. Pepe Department of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the University of Perugia, Perugia; and Sport Horse Study Center, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Perugia, was referred for acute hindlimb lameness. No history of illness or trauma was reported. The foal appeared responsive but reluctant to move. Clinical parameters revealed tachycardia (116 beats/min) and pyrexia (rectal temperature 39.8 \u00b0C) with clear lung auscultation, normal appearance of the umbilicus, no diarrhoea and no appreciable joint swelling. The foal showed left hindlimb lameness (4/5 AAEP lameness scale), swelling of the croup and thigh and croup asymmetry. Complete blood count showed neutrophilic leucocytosis, increased serum amyloid A and brinogen concentrations. Ultrasound examination showed no signi cant abnormalities of the umbilicus or the abdomen. In the thorax, comet-tail artefacts were noted, bilaterally. Ultrasound examination of the croup and thigh revealed multiple circumscribed areas of echogenic fluid cranial to the left femur and in the caudal region of the left thigh, in addition to irregularity of the left acetabular and ischial tuberosity bone surfaces. Medical treatment was started with broad- spectrum antibiotics and surgical treatment proposed. Radiographic and computed tomography (CT) examinations of the pelvis were performed. Ventrodorsal and oblique projections revealed extensive and irregular radiolucent areas surrounded by sclerosis on the left acetabulum and osteolysis of the left ischial tuberosity and ischium. At CT scan, extensive areas of osseous hypoattenuation and severe irregularity were found affecting the left acetabulum ( Fig 1 ), the left ischium bone and the left transverse process of the sixth lumbar vertebra with involvement of the intertransverse joint. At post-contrast venous phase, asymmetrical contrast enhancement was found on the left gluteal muscles.A sterile sample collection of the lesions was performed and submitted for microbiological evaluation. After 24 h of incubation, a pure growth of Streptococcus spp. was obtained. Due to the worsening of the clinical condition, the foal was subjected to euthanasia. At necropsy, left gluteal femoral and sacral wing showed osteolytic areas. The lesions involving the left ischial tuberosity and the left transverse process of L6 were con rmed. Evaluation of the ventral part of the sacroiliac area revealed an abnormal appearance of the left internal iliac artery. Upon opening, a thrombus composed of purulent material was observed ( Fig 2c ). A nodular lesion was also found on the right lung ( Fig 2d ). Samples were collected from all lesions (lung, artery, muscle abscesses and bone) and a pure culture of S. zooepidemicus was obtained from each sample.

The nasal mucosa, mucosa of the arytenoidcartilages, and regional lymph nodes were hypointense on T2and T1 MRI images with the arytenoid cartilages and regional lymph nodesconrmed the original diagnosis of amyloidosis. Six fractions of helical tomotherapy did not provide signi cant improvement in respiratory effort, and permanent tracheostomy was performed.Haemorrhagic nasal discharge and mucosal plaques in pharynx, larynx, and trachea worsened over a 19-monthinterim. This paper offers the rst description of the CT and MRI ndings of nasopharyngeal amyloidosis in a horse, and the rst description of the use of helical tomotherapy in an equine patient. Signalment, history, and presenting complaint A 3-year-old Arabian stallion presented to the VeterinaryMedical Teaching Hospital at Texas A&M University (VMTH) fordiagnostic imaging and evaluation of amyloidosis of the nasalpassages. The patient presented after clinical signs of respiratorystridor and nasal discharge did not respond to of dexamethasone 1(0.05 mg/kg bwt i.v. s.i.d. for 14 flunixin meglumine (Excede4; bwt per os s.i.d. Biopsy of the nasal passages con rmed the presence of diffuse plasmacytic rhinitis with abundant eosinophilic, amorphousmaterial that was positive to Congo Red stain and consistent withamyloid. On presentation to the VMTH, the patient was bright,alert, and responsive with increased upper respiratory noiseduring inspiration and expiration. Serosanguinous nasal dischargewas noted from the left nostril and there was decreased airflow from the left nostril when compared to the right. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. Imaging and diagnosis To assess the patient for extent and severity of amyloidosis, avariety of diagnostics were performed over a period of3 months during which the patient was hospitalised on computed tomographic (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and endoscopic imaging are For CT, the patient was anaesthetised, AS) 5using the following technical parameters: 120 kV, 233 mAs, 3 mm slices with aninterslice gap of 0.6 mm, tube rotation of 1.0 s, and pitch of0.55. The eld of view was set at 500 cm with matrix dimensions of 512 9512 cm to include the tip of the nose rostrally through the atlanto-occipital joint caudally andencompassing the entire mediolateral width of the head.Contiguous images were reconstructed in three standardplanes using bone and soft tissue algorithms. Window widthand level were altered according to viewer preference. TheCT showed mild thickening of the rostral mucosa of the leftnasal passage. A focal region of the mucosa in the left nasalpassage was rounded and heterogeneous in attenuation(Fig 1a ). The patient was positioned in right lateral recumbency for MRI examination of the head to assess the severity of diseaseprogression and extent of tissues affected. The study wasperformed with a 3 Tesla system (Magnetom Verio) 5and spin echo T2 weighted(T2W) transverse (TR 3500 ms, TE 82 ms, slice thickness 4 mm,interslice gap 0.4 mm, flip angle 132, FOV: 300, Matrix: 5129432 cm), dorsal (TR 5290 ms, TE 89 ms, slice thickness 4 mm, interslice gap 0.4 mm, flip angle 131, FOV: 400, Matrix: cm). 3.89, TI 900 ms, slicethickness 0.78 mm, flip angle 12, FOV: 500, Matrix: 5129512 cm). Post-contrast sequences were acquired 15 following i.v. administration of 80 mL ofgadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist) 7. The MRI showed thickening of the nasal mucosa, alar, and basal folds whichalmost completely occluded the right and left nasalpassages. This thickened tissue contained regions of relativeT2 and T1 hypointensity with patchy, andheterogeneous contrast enhancement of the nasal mucosa(Fig 1b -d). These changes were most severe at the rostral most extent of the nares, and the abnormal tissue extendedat least as far caudally as teeth 105/205 and 106/206 medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes were enlarged bilaterally with mildly heterogeneous signal intensity on T2 weighted sequences. The mucosa of the right and left arytenoid cartilages was asymmetrical, with small, bulbous areas of thickening along their ventral contour. The mucosa of the left arytenoid was larger than the mucosa of the right, and the bulbous regions were hypointense on T2 weighted images and hyperintense on T1 weighted images when compared to the normal cartilage. Based on these ndings, amyloidosis of the nasal retropharyngeal lymph nodes was suspected. Endoscopy of the upper airways was performed multiple times during the patient 's prolonged stay at the VMTH. Repeat examinations were indicated to evaluate progressively increasing respiratory effort and reduced nasal airflow. The rst procedure revealed signi cant narrowing of the left nasal passage with enlargement of the soft tissues of the medial aspect of the left nostril, nasal passage, andalong the Fig 2a and d). Subsequent endoscopy procedures showed more severe reddening of the larynx and pharynx with progressive enlargement of the mucosa of the right arytenoid cartilage 2b -c). of the mucosa of the left arytenoid cartilage, and submandibular lymph nodes were performed and con rmed amyloidosis of all tissues with additional evidence mild lymphoid hyperplasia, the presence of apolipoprotein A-I, lambda light chain and no SAA protein suggesting localised AL (lambda) amyloidosis of the nasal and upper airway mucosa.

Noclinicalimprovement was appreciated following tomotherapy. A permanent tracheostomy was performed and the patient was discharged. Communications with the owner 7months after the last tomotherapy treatment revealed that the horse lived comfortably asabreeding stallion. Mild haemorrhagic discharge from the nostrils and tracheostomy site was reported following exercise and rarely when semen was collected. During this interim, nasal airflow was also subjectively improved when the tracheostomy site was occluded.

Thehorse was breathing normally though the permanenttracheostomy site. Complete blood count and serum chemistry were normal with exception of mild hyperproteinemia (79 passages, pharynx, and hadlarge orange to yellow plaques that almost obliterated theairway, being much more extensive than those seen onprevious endoscopic examinations ( Fig 2e and f). In the nasal passages, the plaques were somewhat retracted into themucosa. Very small plaques were present in the floor of the medial compartment of the left and right guttural pouches.The tracheal mucosa was reddened with variably sizedplaques extending its entire length to the carina. A pool ofbrown to red fluid was present in the thoracic inlet. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid had a large amount of red blood cells and haemosiderophages and was otherwisecytologically normal. Ophthalmic examination showedhaemolacria, and subconjunctival and conjunctival in ltrates in both eyes suspected to represent amyloid ( Supplementary Item 1 ); however, neoplastic or other in ltrates (such as squamous cell carcinoma or papilloma) could not be ruledout. Thoracic radiographs were normal and unchangedcompared with those obtained 1 year prior. Ultrasound of thelarynx and pharynx showed submandibular lymphadenopathyand unremarkable appearance of the laryngeal cartilages.Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging showed persistentdeposits consistent with the previously diagnosed amyloid withfocal reduction in soft tissue thickness of the nares and rostralnasal mucosa compared with the prior study. While underanaesthesia for imaging, the horse developed hypotensionthat was poorly responsive to inotropes and the study wasaborted before images of the larynx/pharynx could beobtained. Biopsy samples pharyngeal plaques pharyngitis without de nitive evidence of amyloidosis on Congo red stain. While not con rmed histopathologically, worsening amyloidosis remained high on the differential list forprogressive plaques in the mucosa of the larynx, pharynx,trachea, and periocular tissues. Re-irradiation of this patientwas not pursued for a number of reasons, driven principallyby the clinically disappointing response to the rst course of radiation therapy and the perception of increasedanaesthetic risk during repeated anaesthetic procedures.Extension of amyloid deposits beyond the larynx precludedtreatment of all affected areas. Since helical tomotherapyand CT share similar designs, longitudinal treatmentdistance is limited by how much volume of the patient willt into the bore. In this patient, the disease had progressed far beyond the original treatment eld, and beyond the volume limitations of helical tomotherapy. Referral toanother institution with a conventional linear accelerator toretreat the previous site as well as new areas of progressiondeeper into the head and neck was declined by theowner. The patient was euthanised 22 months following initial presentation due to progressively worsening clinical signs anddeteriorating quality of life perceived by the owner.Discussion Amyloidosis is a relatively rare disease in the equine patient(Husby 1988; Van Andel et al. 1998) that refers to a number of grouped diseases occuring secondary to abnormaldeposition of extracellular amyloid, an insoluble protein,within tissue, either systemically or locally. Both local andsystemic forms of amyloidosis are recognised in humans andanimals and may occur on their own, or in some cases, inassociation with neoplasia (Shaw et al. 1987; Murphy 2010; et al. 1998; Kim et al. 2005; Portela et al. 2012). The systemic form of amyloidosis in the horse is mostfrequently the reactive or secondary form which is related tochronic in flammatory disease and results in deposition of amyloid apoprotein (AA type) (Kim et al. 2005; Gilad et al. 2007). The primary form of amyloidosis (AL type) is rarelysystemic and occurs secondary to abnormal amyloidproduction by plasma cells (Nappert et al. 1988; Kim et al. 2005; Gilad et al. 2007). Amyloidosis can affect many different types of tissues, and the clinical signs reported arerelated to the tissue affected. In horses, AL amyloidosisfrequently affects the nasal passages and upper respiratorytract and reported clinical signs include abnormal or increasedrespiratory noise, exercise intolerance, upper airwayobstruction secondary to thickening of the tissues, andepistaxis related to ulceration of the mucosa (Shaw Andel et al. 1998; Portela et al. 2012). Differential diagnoses include fungal rhinitis sinusitis, such as secondary Diagnosis may becon histopathology and affected tissues appear green under polarised light following staining with Congo Red. To the authors 'knowledge, this is the rst report describing the CT and MRI ndings of an equine patient with a con rmed diagnosis of nasal amyloidosis. The current literature does not describe imaging abnormalities speci ct o amyloidosis, but abnormal areas noted on CT and MRI in thepresent case correlate with affected tissues noted onendoscopy and histopathology. CT and MRI have been usedin cases of amyloidosis in humans to monitor progression ofdisease but speci c changes associated with the disease are not reported (Gilad et al. 2007; Oluk and Murphy 2010). In human cases of amyloidosis, T2W hypointense lesions withvariable contrast enhancement are described, similar tothose seen in this patient (Marton et al. 1991; Panda et al. 2007). The most commonly described treatment in horses iscon ned to surgical excision, and the success of this is dependent on the degree of dissemination of disease.Unfortunately, based on the imaging and corroboratinghistological ndings, the extent of the disease precluded surgical excision in this patient. Focal radiation, as a soletherapy or in conjunction with surgery, is reported in humansto decrease the size of masses, arrest the progression ofdisease and improve the symptoms associated withamyloidosis (Monroe et al. 2004; Neuner et al. 2010; Oluk and Murphy 2010; Truong et al. 2011). To the authors 'knowledge, this is also the rst report to describe the use of helical tomotherapy in veterinary medicine on an equine patient aswell as being the rst report to describe its use for treatment of amyloidosis. Unfortunately, in this case, the patient 's clinical signs did not signi cantly improve despite treatment.

The radiationprotocol used in this case varied from those reported in thehuman literature. The principal reason for this change is theconstraint of requiring general anaesthesia for radiationtherapy in veterinary patients. Due to this constraint, adecreased number of fractions ( ve instead of 10) was prescribed, and due to the young age of the patient andconcern for radiation therapy related toxicities, the dose perfraction was not increased. Including the entire protocol forthe radiation treatment of this patient and comparing it tothose used in human medicine is considered beyond thescope of this paper. Histopathology correlated with MRIndings that helped characterize the extent of locoregional disease involving the nasal passages, arytenoids, and lymphnodes. This case highlights the use of multimodal imaging inthe work-up and diagnosis of amyloidosis in a horse, withpalliative treatment able to prolong good quality of life andfunction as a breeding stallion. Inability to arrest the long termprogression of this disease and/or its symptoms despite manytherapeutic attempts underscores the need for moreeffective therapeutic options for amyloidosis.

Although there isademand forradiation therapy inlarge animal cases, there arecertain limitations ofexternal beam radiation therapy forhorses that restrict treatment options. Currently, there areonly veveterinary teaching hospitals intheUnited States where external beam radiation therapy can be performed onhorses and other large animals. This isin contrast tothe roughly 80facilities, both academic and private, available for small animals. The goal ofthis commentary istogive abrief overview ofexternal beam radiation therapy and highlight thesteps involved, and the technical difculties faced, while treating horses with external beam radiation therapy. Methods ofradiation delivery There are anumber ofways radiation can bedelivered: external beam radiation therapy, plesiotherapy, and interstitial brachytherapy. External beam radiation isthemost commonly used and available modality inveterinary medicine. External beam therapy rayphotons orelectrons atatumour from );helical tomotherapy units (Fig2)deliver x-ray photons; and Co60machines deliver gamma ray photons. Most veterinary facilities use linear accelerators with photon energies ranging from 4to8MV (Farrelly and McEntee and Gantry GantryCouch Flat panel Flat panela) b)Fig1:a)and b)AnONCORTMDigital Medical Linear Accelerator with onboard imaging, IMRT and IGRT capability. Thegantry can rotate through 360\u00b0around the patient couch allowing the targeting ofthetumour from different angles. Onboard imaging assures accurate positioning ofthe cases prior totreatment delivery. Foronboard imaging, imaging flatpanel is extended and animage ismade using anMV beam. Once to treat horses with radiation therapy but thiscommentary will focus onexternal beam techniques. External beam radiation therapy There are different techniques bywhich external beam radiation can be delivered. Electrons are used totreat super cial lesion like sarcoids cutaneous Orton 2010a), whereas tumours). The location ofthe tumour and the radiation sensitivity of adjacent normal tissues istaken into consideration when determining beam orientation. Fortumours not adjacent to sensitive normal tissues, asingle beam orparallel-opposed beams may be appropriate and the calculation ofthe machine parameters can be performed by hand (i.e. manual calculations). With such aplan, avoiding radiation dose tonormal tissues adjacent thetumour isdifcult and the entire treated eld(tumour and normal tissues) receives the same dose. The signi cant developments inthe eld ofveterinary imaging using CTand advances inradiation oncology. Accurate delineation of tumour margins using cross-sectional imaging allows formore advanced conformal treatment techniques like3Dconformal radiation therapy (3DCRT), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) and stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) todeliver radiation plans. Using these new techniques, veterinary radiation oncologists can now target thetumour more precisely and limit thedose tonormal tissues. Radiation dose tothetumour can then beincreased (dose escalation) toachieve greater tumour control. Conformal treatment techniques Conformal radiation therapy techniques use cross-sectional images (CTand MRI) and computerised treatment planning todesign radiation plans that target tumours with multiple beams (coplanar and non-coplanar) delivered from different angles. 3DCRT plans uses multiple coplanar beams totarget the tumour volume. number material (typically tungsten) that are individually movable and are used toblock portions ofthe beam (McDermott 3DCRT angle. The isused toshape each eld, often toareas smaller than thetumour volume, and bydoing so,modulates the intensity ofthe radiation beam across the treated volume. This dose modulation enhances dose conformity to the tumour and more effectively reduces radiation dose to normal tissues (Khan and Gibbons 2014b). SRT plans uses multiple (often non-coplanar) tightly collimated beams to deliver very treatments (Tannock linear equipped with MLCs can deliver delivery techniques arenow frequently used inveterinary radiation oncology, there isa greater need toensure accurate, repeatable positioning of the cases. Without precise positioning, the normal tissue sparing advantage of conformal techniques islost. Appropriate positioning ofthe cases isachieved using blocks mattresses ). patient the tumour isoutlined shape the tothe margins ofthe device isthen used forpatient positioning during each radiation treatment. Furthermore, to ensure accurate positioning, image guidance isrequired. Image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) uses either 2-dimentional (double exposure portal images) or3-dimensional (cone radiation treatments. Linear accelerators equipped with on-board digital imaging panels can make portal images and either cone beam CTimages while TomoTherapyTMunits can only make helical KVCT images (Fig5a,b ).Portal images are typically used toverify patient positioning forsimple, non-conformal plans. Cone beam CTimages are necessary forconformal plans using IMRT orSRT. Steps involved inexternal beam radiation Foroptimal and outcome, precise delineation ofthe tumour volume isthe most important step. This isparticularly true when using advanced conformal radiation therapy techniques. For super cial normal critical tissues are identi ed. Ifacomputerised plan is required forconformal treatment techniques, the CTorMRI images areloaded into aplanning computer and thetumour and normal tissues arecontoured (Fig6).Theradiation oncologist determines thenumber and orientation ofbeams and then the computer calculates the dose toallthe contoured structures.

Technical difculties associated with external beam radiation inhorses The advanced conformal techniques described above are frequently used forexternal beam radiation insmall animals; however, there are certain limitations when treating horses. Advanced imaging modalities such asCTand MRI, necessary toplan theconformal techniques, are challenging inhorses forseveral reasons. First, toperform these studies, aspecial table, designed toaccommodate the horse 'sweight, is needed. These tables must bemade ofMRI compatible metals theCTcouch tocontrol thepatient 'smovement. Such tables are commercially manufactured and available atseveral private practices and universities. Second, these tables donot Fig7:After appropriate beam angle placement and computerised planning adose volume histogram isgenerated (DVH) which shows the dose tonormal tissues and the tumour.

Another obstacle totreating horses with external beam radiation therapy isaccess tothe radiation machine. Radiation therapy suites aretypically designed with standard entry door and ahallway with a90-degree angle (referred toasthe maze) leading into the main room that prevents rolling ahorse onatable into thesuite. Only veveterinary teaching hospitals have larger doors and ameans to negotiate orbypass the maze toaccommodate horses in their radiation suites. Once the horse isinthe room, the radiation therapy couch also limits certain gantry angles making 3DCRT orIMRT plans challenging. The gantry willnot tunder the table and angles from 110-degrees to 250-degrees cannot be used intreatment plans. This is important tokeep inmind when theradiation angle unless thehead isrotated. Itisalso possible that portal imaging and cone beam CTs needed to con rm appropriate patient positioning cannot beperformed due to the inability toaccess the flatpanel and restricted gantry positions .Due tothe limitations listed above, considerable forethought isnecessary prior toany equine radiation therapy plan. Conclusion Inconclusion, advanced conformal radiation techniques are now frequently used inveterinary radiation oncology. These arestillmainly restricted tosmall animal cases due tospeci c technical challenges; however, advances arebeing made in the eld ofequine radiation totreat horses.

A previously described algorithmwas applied and cases were included if a diagnosis of AMwas considered highly likely.

Survivors concentrations (survivors: median 3.5 mmol/L; to Increasing CKactivity (P =0.008) and triglyceride concentrations (P 4/22; 18.2%;P=0.002). The prognosis for hospitalised horses with AM is guarded and outcome in this population was associated withadmission CK activity and lactate concentrations, andincreasing Atypical myopathy (AM) and seasonal pasture myopathy inthe USA are seasonal, acute myopathies of grazing horses(Whitwell et al. 1988; Finno et al. Votion et al. 2009; van Galen et al. 2012a) and both are believed to have similar aetiologies (van Galen et al. 2012b; Sponseller et al. 2012; Westermann et al. 2016). A high mortality rate ranging between 74 and 97% has been reported in Europeanoutbreaks while a recent study documented a slightly lowermortality of 61% in UK cases (Gonzalez-Medina et al. 2017). Within the UK, differences in numbers of cases and in theodds of survival were recorded in certain geographiclocations (Gonzalez-Medina et al. 2017). To date, no study has reported survival exclusively in hospitalised horses orspeci cally the South-East of England, where the disease is particularly common (Gonzalez-Medina et al. 2017). Nonsurvivors mostly die or are subjected to euthanasia within72 h of onset of clinical signs (Hosie et al. 1986; Whitwell et al. 1988; Votion 2007, et al. 2008; van Galen et al. 2012a). Currently, ingestion of the toxin hypoglycin A is thought to be responsible for the observedclinicopathological changes (van Galen et al. 2012b; Votion et al. 2014). Hypoglycin A an acquired multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase de ciency, impairing mitochondrial metabolism and leading accumulation inmyo bres (Westermann et al. 2008; Sponseller dehydrogenases(Meda et al. 1999; Joskow et al. 2006) which in turn block a number of steps in the mitochondrial lipid metabolism, causingan energy de ciency. Clinical signs of AM are caused by severe rhabdomyolysis of type 1 myo bres and include acute stiffness, muscle fasciculation, sweating, respiratory dif culty and weakness, often progressing to al. 2007; Palencia and Rivero (CK),aspartate amino transferase (AST) of severe rhabdomyolysis is frequentlyobserved in AM-affected horses. Although in earlier studies, themagnitude of enzyme activity increases has not beenassociated with outcome, two recent studies did identify anassociation between CK activities and survival (Boemer et al. 2017; Gonzalez-Medina et al. 2017). In addition, abnormalities of energy metabolism including hyperglycaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and hyperlactataemia have beenreported in earlier and one recent report (Finno et al. 2006; Westermann et al. 2008; Boemer et al. 2017) but information on the frequency and magnitude of these metabolicderangements in clinical patients and their association withoutcome remains sparse. In recent years, AM has receivedincreasing attention in the UK and anecdotally based onsubjective impression, it appears that survival of hospitalisedcases has improved over time. Although a recent study didnot identify differences in glucose, lactate and triglycerideconcentrations between survivors and nonsurvivors (Boemeret al. 2017), clinically, there seems to be a possible correlation in hospitalised horses. \u00a92018 EVJ doi: 10.1111/eve.12895The aims and objectives of this study were therefore to determine the frequency and extent of metabolicabnormalities, particularly hyperglycaemia, hyperlactataemiaand hypertriglyceridaemia and to establish the outcome andclinicopathological ndings associated with outcome in hospitalised horses suffering with AM in three referral hospitalsin the South-East of England. The study tested the hypothesisthat admission serum CK activity and glucose, lactate andtriglyceride concentrations were signi cantly associated with outcome in hospitalised horses with AM. Materials and methods Medical records from January 2011 to August 2017 from threeequine referral hospitals in the South-East of England (theRoyal Veterinary College Equine Referral and Hospitaland Diagnostic Centre [REHDC]) were searched for horseswith a diagnosis of AM. A diagnosis was established based onclinical (clinical signs and biochemistry changes compatiblewith a myopathy) or post-mortem ndings in a horse kept at pasture by following a diagnostic algorithm for AM that hasbeen previously described and used in other studies (vanGalen et al. 2012a; Boemer et al. 2017; Gonzalez-Medina et al. 2017). In cases admitted after Acer pseudoplantanus (sycamore trees) had been identi ed as source of hypoglycin A, known or an possible exposure to sycamore trees was alsoincluded as an essential criterion. Horses with a known historyof exertional myopathy or of rigorous exercise prior todevelopment of clinical signs were excluded. In addition,horses with a nal diagnosis other than AM were also excluded. Signalment, year of hospitalisation, admissionparameters and selected clinical signs present prior to or atadmission (increased recumbency, distension of urinarybladder, signs of intravenous glucose, intravenous insulin, vitamins[including oral or intravenous administration Eand/or multivitamins], oral carnitine intravenous orintramuscular sedation with alpha agonists), days ofhospitalisation and outcome (from survival to discharge,death or until being subjected to euthanasia) were recorded.Horses that were subjected to euthanasia due to nancial considerations were excluded from outcome analysis. SerumCK and AST activity and triglyceride concentrations obtainedon subsequent days of hospitalisation were recorded andcategorised as either increased or decreased. An increase ordecrease was based on comparison of the highest valuemeasured during hospitalisation to the admission sample.Where available, post-mortem ndings were recorded. Statistical analysis Data were analysed using a commercially available softwareprogramme. Normality was assessed using the Kolmogorov - Smirnov test. Normally distributed data were recorded asmean /C6standard deviation; non-normally distributed data were displayed as median and range. Categorical data (sex,presence/absence of recumbency, urinary bladder distensionand colic signs, increase/decrease of and activityand triglyceride concentrations on subsequent days) wereanalysed using chi-squared or Fisher 's exact test. Relevant continuous data (age at presentation, heart and respiratoryrates, rectal temperature, CK and AST activities, packed cellvolume, total protein, creatinine, glucose, lactate andtriglyceride concentrations on admission) were analysedusing a student 'sttest (normally distributed data) or Mann -Whitney Utest (non-normally distributed data). The correlation between glucose and lactate concentrations andglucose and triglyceride concentrations on admission wereinvestigated using a Spearman 's correlation. Statistical signi cance was set at P 0.05. Results Sixty-four horses met the inclusion criteria, 15 from the RVC,25 from BEVC and 24 from REHDC. The median age of 25mares, 35 geldings and four stallions was 5 years (range0.25 -22 years); age and sex were not associated with outcome (P =0.32 and P =0.5, respectively). Breeds were 20 Cobs and Cob crosses, 13 Thoroughbreds and Thoroughbredcrosses, nine Irish draughts and crosses, seven Warmbloods,four Connemara ponies, three Welsh ponies, two Arabiansand one Andalusian, New Forest pony, native pony andMiniature Shetland each. In two horses, a breed was notrecorded. The date of presentation was recorded for 27cases: seven (26%) presented in winter (December -January), eight (30%) in spring (March -May) and 12 (44%) in autumn (September -November). Hyperglycaemia (reference range 4.2 -6.7 mmol/L) was present in 28/37 (76%) of cases on admission, while one horsepresented Plasma lactate (referencerange 0.2 increased in 31/35 (89%) and 22/24 (92%) horses on admission, respectively. Afterremoval of one outlier with hypoglycaemia, blood correlated ( q=0.056; P=0.41). Twenty-eight horses survived (44%), 30 were to euthanasia and six died (nonsurvivors 56%). Comparison ofclinicopathological data between survivors and nonsurvivorsis shown in Tables 1 and 2. Increasing CK activities and triglyceride concentrations, but not AST activities duringhospitalisation were associated with outcome and noneof the treatments with the exception of sedation wereassociated with outcome ( Table 2 ). Post-mortem examination was carried out on 16/36 nonsurvivors in this study and 1/22survivors had muscle biopsies. Findings were consistent withAM including multifocal process compatible with Zenker 's degeneration and necrosis in bres of postural and/or respiratory muscles (Cassart et al. 2007; van Galen et al. 2012a). Discussion The 56% mortality rate of horses suffering from AM in this studywas numerically lower than that documented in previousstudies in Europe (74 -97%) (Brandt et al. 1997; Westermann et al. 2008; van Galen et al. 2012a) and comparable to or slightly better than a recent study in the UK (61%)(Gonzalez-Medina et al. 2017). However, direct comparison with other studies is dif cult. In contrast to this study, hospitalisation was not a requirement for inclusion in previousstudies. It is possible that more intensive support provided tohospitalised horses contributed to a better outcome (vanGalen et al. 2012a). On the other hand, mildly or very \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd91 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARYseverely affected horses and horses found dead might nothave been referred, and the effect on overall prognosis isdifcult to predict. The study provides important information nonetheless. Veterinarians might be able to advise horseowners interested in referral better about expected outcomewhilst in the past the poor prognosis might have deterredveterinarians and horse owners alike from referral. In this study, presence or absence of increased recumbency, colic signs or bladder distension were notassociated with survival which is in contrast to previousobservations (van Galen et al. 2012b; Boemer et al. 2017; Gonzalez-Medina et al. 2017). This might be associated with the retrospective nature of this study and inconsistencies inthe record keeping. Presence of a clinical sign tends to bemore frequently recorded than the absence which mightexplain the lack of a signi cant difference in regards to colic signs and bladder distension. However, the latter was close tosigni cance. Regardless of the underlying cause, the inability to stand is usually associated with a poor prognosis in adulthorses, which has also been demonstrated for AM (vanGalen et al. 2012b; Boemer et al. 2017; Gonzalez-Medina et al. 2017). Although increased time spent recumbent was frequently recorded in the cases presented here, it is asubjective statement. It was also dif cult to ascertain from records whether cases were unable to rise or simply spentmore time laying down which might explain the lack ofsigni cance. In cases of myopathy, CK release into the plasma is proportionate to the amount of muscle damaged andintuitively, one would expect extensive damage to beassociated with a worse outcome (Toutain et al. 1995). Undoubtedly, the speci c muscle group involved also plays a signi cant role as damage to myocardium or respiratory muscles likely has a large impact on prognosis, even if arelatively small amount of muscle mass is affected. The twomost recent studies have both identi ed an association between initial CK activities and survival (Boemer et al. 2017; Gonzalez-Medina et al. 2017) while authors of a previous study observed that CK enzyme activity not alwayscorrelated closely with the deterioration of clinical signs(Votion et al. 2007). Results in the present study also indicated that high admission values and increasing CK activities overtime worsened the prognosis. As overlap between groupswas large and case numbers relatively small, CK valuesshould always be interpreted in light of the clinical ndings and ideally also in conjunction with follow-up enzymemeasurements. In this study, we did not observe fluctuations in CK activities once values had started to decrease andonce a decrease was detected it tended to continue. SerumAST activity, which increases more slowly than CK activity,was not signi cantly higher in nonsurvivors than survivors. It is possible that in nonsurviving horses, due to rapiddeterioration, AST activity never actually increased to its fullextent. The signi cantly shorter duration of hospitalisation observed in nonsurvivors supports this assumption. In thefuture, measurements of acylcarnitine pro les might add information that can be used prognostically (Boemer et al. 2017). However, as it is unlikely that any single predictiveindicator or combination of predictive factors will be 100%accurate, decisions about continuation of treatment are inthe authors 'opinion best based on case progression in combination with individual circumstances. Due to the profound effects of hypoglycin A and its toxic metabolites on energy metabolism, affected horses oftenpresent with increasedplasma triglyceride concentrations. Hyperglycaemia waspresent in 76% of cases on admission, similar to what has beenreported before (Finno et al. 2006; Votion et al. 2007), while only one horse presented with hypoglycaemia. Signi cant differences between survivors and nonsurvivors were notidenti ed which could be associated with low case numbers or the overall common occurrence of this abnormality. However,plasma lactate concentrations were signi cantly higher in nonsurvivors compared to survivors. Previously, increasedplasma lactate concentrations in sick horses have widely beenregarded as an indicator of anaerobic metabolism secondaryto tissue hypoxia. The increased PCV and creatinineconcentrations observed here suggest that some degree ofhypovolaemia was present in most horses, although renaldamage could also have contributed to increases in the latterparameter (Cassart et al. 2007; van Galen et al. 2012a). More recently, the close interactions between glucose and lactatemetabolism have been emphasised as an alternative cause ofhyperlactataemia (Garcia-Alvarez et al. 2014a,b).

Hyperglycaemia andhyperlactataemia observed in horses with AM in this and otherreports can probably, at least partially, be attributed toincreased glycolysis and decreased oxidative pathways(Garcia-Alvarez et al. 2014b; Kaukonen et al. 2014). This assumption is supported by the positive correlation betweenblood glucose and lactate concentrations. Most horses in thisstudy presented with increased plasma triglycerideconcentrations. As nearly all horses were admitted shortly afteronset of clinical signs without any prolonged periods ofstarvation, this nding re flects the impact of the toxic metabolites on lipid and energy metabolism (Votion et al. 2007; Lemieux et al. 2016). It also highlights the importance of determining triglyceride concentrations in affected horses.While admission triglyceride concentrations were not associatedwith outcome, a further increase on subsequent measurementsduring hospitalisation was associated. In some horses,measurements fluctuated, often re flecting the level of nutritional support (almost exclusively intravenous glucose infusions)provided to the patient. The fact that nonsurvivors were morelikely to have a further increase in triglyceride concentrationsafter admission could indicate more severe metabolicdisturbances. Further studies focusing on this aspect areneeded. Admission temperature was lower in nonsurvivors compared to survivors which is a fact that correlates withndings of previous studies. This might represent reduced peripheral perfusion due to cardiovascular compromise orreduced rectal tone (Votion et al. 2007; Westermann et al. 2011; van Galen et al. 2012a,b). Low serum calcium concentrations have previously been reported in horsessuccumbing to AM (Votion et al. 2007; Boemer et al. 2017). Calcium deposition in damaged tissues is the main cause ofhypocalcaemia in people with rhabdomyolysis and this couldalso be true in horses (Akmal et al. 1986). Other electrolyte abnormalities less frequently recorded in the literature werenot investigated in this study (Votion et al. 2007; van Galen et al. 2013). Use of sedation was signi cantly associated with outcome with 62.1% of nonsurvivors receiving sedationcompared to 18.2% survivors. Sedation was used to relieveoesophageal obstruction, a common sequela of AM (Finnoet al. 2006; Boemer et al. 2017) and in animals in pain or distress. Both repeated oesophageal obstruction and thedegree of pain are likely indicative of more extensive diseaseand were associated with a worse prognosis in a recent study(Boemer et al. 2017). Severe pain and distress might also be reasons for euthanasia due to welfare considerations,particularly if the prognosis is perceived to be poor. Due totheir inhibitory effects on insulin release, some authorsconsider use of alpha 2 agonists contraindicated in horseswith AM and a direct negative impact on survival in this studycannot be excluded (Fabius and Westermann 2018). In otherstudies, use of vitamins and/or antioxidants has beenassociated with a better outcome (van Galen et al. 2012b). This was not apparent in this study, probably due to theoverall quite uniform treatment approach (almost 80% ofhorses received some form of vitamins) and small numbers. Inaddition, carnitine was administered orally in all cases but due to its low bioavailability absorption is very limited (Fosteret al. 1988; Zeyner and Harmeyer 1999). The effects of intravenous administration should therefore be re-evaluatedbefore conclusions about its ef cacy are drawn. The largest limitations of the present study are the retrospective nature, relatively low case numbers and,particularly in regards to effects of treatment, a likely strongTABLE 2: Clinicopathological parameters (categorical data) fromhorses with atypical myopathy presenting to referral hospitals,divided into horses surviving and not surviving to discharge.

Information about certain clinical signs foundto be useful in other studies such as sweating, musclefasciculations, anorexia and oesophageal obstruction, werenot reliably recorded in all records and were therefore notanalysed (van Galen et al. 2012b; Boemer et al. 2017). Although a standardised data collection form was applied,the details that could be obtained for each case variedand little follow-up information was available. However, AMremains a sporadic disease and obtaining large casenumbers from a certain region or a single country remainsdifcult. Although advances in identi cation of toxic metabolites responsible for AM have been made, thosemethods have only recently become more widely available(Boemer et al. 2015; Sander et al. 2016). In the majority of clinical cases, diagnosis of AM still relies on identi cation of a severe myopathy in horses at pasture with sycamoretrees being found in the vicinity. It is therefore possible thatsome horses in this report could have suffered from adifferent myopathy. Considering that AM is by far the mostcommon cause of myopathies at pasture, most, if not all,horses were probably correctly diagnosed. This wassupported by post-mortem ndings which were strongly suggestive of AM. The authors believe that the study,despite these limitations, still provides useful information forpractitioners, particularly in the UK, when dealing with thesedifcult cases. In conclusion, this study suggests that the mortality rate in hospitalised horses suffering from AM could be better thanpreviously reported, and that admission serum CK activitycould be of prognostic value. A larger study determiningmortality rates of hospitalised and nonhospitalised patients isrequired in order to assess whether these results represent trueimprovement in mortality rate. In addition, metabolicabnormalities are frequent in horses with AM and requirefurther investigations. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Adult ponies (n =12) were randomly allotted to one of the two equal groups. Bothof the groups were anaesthetised with xylazine -ketamine - diazepam and had single (SLS, SLC) ligation of the spermaticcord on one side and double (DLS, DLC) ligation on the otherside using silk (Group T1) and catgut (Group T2). using 3.50 /C60.34 and DLC 7.16 /C60.47 min. Scrotal oedema was noticed in all of the ponies from Day 1 to Day 15. The scrotal circumference andtesticular volume in animals of both of the groups showed asigni cant (P <0.05) increase from Day 1 to Day 4. Orchiectomy to recover testicular remnants was performed in all of theanimals on Day 41. Straw-coloured fluid accumulation was noticed in seven testicular remnants (4 T1 and 3 T2). Onetesticle from Group DLS showed suppuration. grossand histological abnormalities were detected in all doubleligated testes. The changes were more severe in the DLS thanthe DLC group and their epididymis (n =3) also showed necrosis, broplasia and an obstructed lumen. Severe adhesions had developed in three and one testicle only fromthe SLS and SLC groups respectively. The remaining testes andepididymis in both of these groups showed only mild-to-moderate adhesions. From this study, it was concluded thatcastration may not be achieved by percutaneous singleligation of the spermatic cord in ponies. Although doubleligation induces marked gross and histopathological changes,assessments of the testosterone levels and sperm analysis arerequired before recommending this procedure. Use of silk forligation of the spermatic cord is advantageous over catgutbut maintenance of strict asepsis is mandatory. Introduction Bilateral orchiectomy (orchidectomy) is the most populartechnique to castrate male horses (Schumacher 2012). Theprocedure ensures sterilisation but is associated with severaldisadvantages and complications in 20 -38% of horses (Mason et al. 2005). They include haemorrhage, eventration, excessive post-operative 1991;Schumacher 1992, 1996). The orchiectomy procedure isexpensive for the poor owners (of working ponies) residing inthe developing nations. Being invasive, strict asepsis andtrained surgeons are required (Hafez 1993; Trotter 1988). Post-operative care during second intention healing of the scrotalwounds is also essential (Searle et al. 1999). The pain and stress associated with this surgery may reduce the immunity of theanimals. Laparoscopic orchiectomy is a minimally invasiveprocedure but and specialexpertise (Hendrickson 2012). Inadvertent perforation ofviscera or blood vessels is the major disadvantage (Ragleet al. 1998; Desmaizieres et al. 2003). Immunologic castration using a vaccine against Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone(GnRH) that suppresses testicular function of the stallion hasbeen described (Malmgren et al. 2001). However, these horses become sterile temporarily and repeated immunisation isneeded. The response to vaccination also varies from animalto animal and their libido does not get abolished (Janett et al. 2009). Section-Ligation-Release (SLR) technique wherein thespermatic cords are triple clamped, transected and ligated,without removing the testes has been successful in castratinglimited numbers of horses (Saifzadeh et al. 2008). Being invasive in nature the procedure may also be accompaniedby several limitations of the conventional orchiectomy. Development of an alternative simple, inexpensive and reliable procedure of equine castration is therefore neededparticularly for application under eld conditions in the developing countries. Pinhole castration (in situ spermaticcord ligation) has been described as a novel ruminants (Ponvijay 2007; Okwee-Acaiet al. 2008; Fazili et al. 2009) and stray dogs (Baba et al. 2013). In donkeys, the technique was satisfactorily used(Badawy 2009) in one study. However, in another trial it failedto induce necrosis and atrophy of the testes (Abu-Ahmedet al. 2012). Considering the highly optimistic reports in farm animals and dogs but contradictory initial results in equids, aprospective study was planned to evaluate a pinholecastration technique using silk or catgut for single or doubleligation of the spermatic cords in male ponies. Materials and methods Twelve healthy, adult, male ponies used as pack animals wereincluded in the study after a written consent was obtained \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd96 Theproject was also approved bytheinstitutional post-graduate student advisory committee. Every animal was subjected toadetailed clinical examination including con rmation ofnormal bilateral prior to the initiation of the study.

The animals were designated for percutaneous ligation ofthe spermatic (pinhole to general anaesthesia inanimals that had been fasted overnight.

Results Mean (/C6s.e.) age toGroup T1and T2 was 6.33/C60.61 intheir age and body weight. The castrations were performed outdoors onlevel grassy ground. However, due tothe inclement weather, three animals were castrated inside ashed over straw bedding. Anaesthesia was satisfactory, lasted foranadequate period, terminated rapidly and recovery was free from excitement inalloftheponies. The spermatic cords were easily located within the scrotum. Their lateral displacement posed some difculty but could beheld didnotpose difculty. However, onone occasion while passing thehypodermic fluiddribbled from itshub indicating puncture ofthe testicular tunic. The needle was therefore withdrawn and redirected away from thetesticle.

The needle holes were faintly visible atthe completion theligature broke inadvertently while tying theknot. The procedure was therefore repeated in this case.

The testicles in Group SLSshowed mild-to-moderate degeneration of the germinalepithelium (3/6), Leydig cell necrosis (1/6) and broplasia (1/6). Testicles from Group SLC were least affected and had mild-to-moderate degeneration of the germinal epithelium (3/6). Discussion The age and the weight of the ponies included in the studyvaried but the mean ( /C6s.e.) values in both the groups were almost similar. The ponies included in our study belonged torural farmers who get them castrated only after attainingadult age. Horses may preferably be castrated at 1 -2 years of age beyond which objectionable masculine behavioursdevelop (Schumacher 2012). The xylazine -ketamine -diazepam combination provided effective and safe anaesthesia in all of the ponies included inthe study. Combination of ketamine and one of the alpha-2agonists is a common anaesthetic protocol followed inponies under eld conditions. Addition of diazepam enhances skeletal muscle relaxation (Mathew and Harts eld 1993). Tranquilisation/sedation (acepromazine/chloral hydrate)followed by in ltration 2% lignocaine hydrochloride donkeys has been used satisfactorily (Badawy 2009; Abu-Ahmed et al. 2012). The spermatic cords were easily palpated within the scrotal neck. They are slippery and slender but could be heldwithout dif culty due to the comparatively thin equine skin.The second ligation was always placed distal to the rst. This was done so that no inadvertent punctures of theengorged blood vessels occur. In the ponies included in thisstudy, the spermatic cord of one side was subjected to singleligation and the contralateral side to double ligation usingthe same suture material on both sides. During evaluation ofa new research protocol, two separate treatments arepreferably applied to the contralateral organs to minimise thebias between individuals. Double ligation of the samespermatic cord has to date not been performed in anyspecies. Single ligation unilaterally or bilaterally has beenundertaken in donkeys (Badawy 2009; Abu-Ahmed et al. 2012). The holes created due to the passage of G-16 hypodermic and the reverse-cutting suture needles werelarge enough to accommodate the square knot but not thesurgeon knot. Use of a reverse-cutting needle reduces the riskof suture material tearing through the wound edge (Kuduret al. 2009). Chromic catgut and mono epididymis 2010; Abid and Baghdady 2013; El-Wahed et al. 2014). Silk being cheap and easily available was tried in Group T1 ponies. Being less stiff than catgut, silk does not passeasily through a hypodermic needle making use of a sutureneedle necessary (Fazili et al. 2009; Abu-Ahmed et al. 2012; Baba et al. 2013). The mean time required to complete single ligation of the spermatic cord was similar (3.5 /C60.34 min) in ponies whether silk or catgut was used for pinhole castration. This time periodwas similar to the two earlier reports pertaining to donkeys(Badawy 2009; Abu-Ahmed et al. 2012). The time required for pinhole castration was signi cantly (P <0.05) less than the incision -ligation and segment -ligation -resection procedures (Abu-Ahmed et al. 2012). A comparatively shorter time (40-60 s per ligation) was reported in calves (Ponvijay 2007). The spermatic cord in equines is short and thin as comparedwith ruminants. Consequently, repeated attempts may berequired to rmly grasp it. This species-speci c anatomical peculiarity may be responsible for the comparatively longertime required for ligation in equids. During the rst week following spermatic cord ligation irrespective of the suture material used and whether single ordouble ligation applied, the testicular volume increased twoto three times. The volume decreased persistently thereafter.The values of single ligated testes obtained on Day 40 werelower than the preligated values, whereas in double ligatedtestes, the volume at the end of the study was slightly morethan that of pre-operative value. This might have been dueto accumulation of fluid within the tunics and parenchymaTABLE 1: Circumference of scrotum (Mean /C6s.e.) in ponies following pinhole castration Parameter GroupMeasurements at different intervals (Days) 014 8 1 5 2 8 4 0 and upper-case alphabets indicate signi cant differences within and between groups respectively. \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd99 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARYthat was noticed during orchiectomy, gross and histopathological examinations.

Although double ligation induces markedgross and histopathological changes, assessment of thetestosterone level following double bilateral ligation of thespermatic cord is required before recommending thisprocedure. Use of silk for ligation of the spermatic cord ispreferable to catgut but maintenance of strict asepsis ismandatory. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Archer Department of Veterinary Epidemiology and Population Health, Institute of Infection and Global Health andInstitute of Veterinary Science, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of Liverpool, veterinary medicine Summary Critical appraisal skills enabling assessment of the validityand importance of evidence are essential for clinicians tomake informed decisions regarding what new informationshould be incorporated into their clinical practice. This reviewhighlights key points to consider in a critical reviewconcentrating on common study designs used in the equineliterature. Introduction A vast number of veterinary papers are published every yearin a variety of journals. Although many of these are inreputable journals, and have been through a process ofpeer-review by experts, the quality may still be variable(Pocock et al. 2004). In addition, there are many sources of nonpeer-reviewed literature, including textbooks, reports andproceedings and the internet. Formal systematic reviews arebeginning to appear in the equine veterinary literature (Allenet al. 2012; Sullivan et al. 2015; Dominguez et al. 2016), and RCVS Knowledge and the Equine Veterinary Education arebeginning to publish knowledge summaries (or criticallyappraised topics) (RCVS Knowledge 2017). However, it isusually up to the individual reader to assess the scienti c validity, strength of evidence and practical relevance ofresults presented in a paper and the extent to which theycan be applied to the particular question they are interestedin. To assist the process of critical appraisal a number ofveterinary and non-veterinary organisations have onlineresources and 2017; of different speci c study types such as randomised controlled trials (RCT), validatingdiagnostic or screening tests, guidelines have also been developed for variousstudy designs (More 2010), many of which can be found onthe EQUATOR network website (www.equator-network.org).Speci c guidelines, with checklists, widely in use include those for RCTs (CONSORT) and for strengthening the reporting ofobservational studies (STROBE) (von Elm et al. 2008) available at https://www.strobe-statement.org/index.php?id=available-checklists. Evidence-based medicine, de ned by Sackett et al. (1996) as \"the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care ofindividual patients \", is much more than just critically assessing papers. However, critical appraisal is a key skill that must bemastered to practice evidence-based medicine. The RoyalCollege of Veterinary Surgeons recognises \"How to evaluate evidence \"as an essential day one competence required of all veterinary surgeons (RCVS) and \"critical analysis of new information and research ndings relevant to veterinary medicin e\"is a core competency for accreditation by the American Veterinary Medical Association (Anon AVMA).These requirements recognise the essential role of criticalappraisal for clinicians 'decision-making regarding what new information, among the vast array available, should beincorporated into their clinical practice. Critical appraisal Critical appraisal is a formal, unbiased, systematic approach toassessing the quality and relevance of evidence presented ina paper and its applicability to decision making for ourpatients. It includes evaluation of the appropriateness of thestudy design for the research question, and a carefulassessment of whether the study conforms to speci c criteria, related to the study design. It should be a balancedassessment of bene ts and strengths of research against its flaws and weaknesses. The assessment of methodological quality should be done without consideration (or evenknowledge) of the results, so as to avoid interpretation bias(Kaptchuk 2003), which arises because interpretation ofndings is rarely completely independent of our previous beliefs or preconceptions. For example, higher standards of evidencemay be required in the case of study ndings that contradict an individual 's initial expectations, compared with a study that agrees with these expectations (con rmation bias). For the equine clinician with limited epidemiological or statistical knowledge, it can be dif cult to critically appraise the study design, statistical analyses used and whether theconclusions drawn can be justi ed based on the material presented by the authors. The following sections highlight keypoints that should be considered in a critical review ( Table 1 ), concentrating on randomised controlled trials andobservational studies, which are the most common studydesigns used in the equine literature. What is the main purpose of the study? This includes the clinical question the study seeks to addressand what hypothesis is being tested. Not all research studiesaim to test a single de nitive hypothesis and qualitative research studies investigate particular issues in a broad,open-ended way (Christley and Perkins 2010). The relevanceof the study question and whether it measures an outcomethat is relevant to your clinical practice, e.g. return to athletic \u00a92018 The Authors.

Educ. (2020) 32(2) 104-109 10.1111/eve.12896function or reduced mortality, and whether it adds anythingnew to the literature is also important to consider. Most research studies will evaluate one of the following (Greenhalgh 2001a): Therapy (ef cacy of a drug treatment, surgical procedure or other intervention); Causation (if asuspected risk factor is related to development of a particulardisease); Prognosis (outcome of a disease followingtreatment/diagnosis); Diagnosis (the validity and reliability ofa new diagnostic test and superiority to any existing tests) orScreening (tests applied to a population to detect disease). What type of study design was used (and is this themost appropriate for the question addressed)? Understanding the type of study that has been performed isa prerequisite to evaluation of the strength of evidenceprovided by the study. In addition, knowledge of the designwill enable the reader to determine if the study in questionhas been appropriately designed and conducted (assessingthe internal validity), and, if not, whether this should decreasethe strength of belief in the results. Sometimes, authors willstate that they have performed a particular study design butcareful reading of the methods may contradict this. The hierarchy of evidence ( Fig 1 ), which ranks the relative strength of evidence carried by the different types of studywhen making decisions about clinical interventions, is wellrecognised. The pinnacle of the hierarchy is reserved forpapers in which all the primary studies on a clinical questionor subject are critically appraised according to rigorouscriteria (the systematic review) and meta-analysis, whichintegrates the numerical data from more than one study. Thelatter studies are relatively infrequent in equine veterinaryresearch (Calzetta et al. 2017), but are likely to becomemore common in the future as a greater number of highquality primary clinical research studies (particularlyrandomised controlled trials) are reported. Primary clinicalresearch studies can be experimental or observational. Inexperimental studies, such as the RCT, the investigatorcontrols the allocation of the intervention (e.g. a newtreatment vs. no treatment or an existing treatment) to arandomly selected subset of the study subjects and thencompares between groups of study animals to makeinferences about the effect of the intervention on theoutcome of interest. The RCT can provide strong evidenceand is often regarded as the highest standard of evidence toguide clinical decision-making due to key aspects of designthat aim to avoid bias. Although still infrequent in equineclinical research, RCTs are becoming more common (Sabateet al. 2009; Talbot et al. 2013; Higler et al. 2014). The observational studies (cohort, case control andcross-sectional) are next in the hierarchy, and these arerelatively frequently used in the equine research literature.Descriptive studies such as case reports and case series arevery common in the equine research literature. However,these are not designed to test an association between atherapy and a treatment (Grimes and Schulz 2002). If anauthor draws conclusions about the merits of a particulartherapy from a case report or series, this should be regardedas the author 's opinion/conjecture only, as these provide limited evidence to support this. Is the study internally valid? Internal validity is concerned with the quality of the study as itapplies to the population that is being studied, and itsassessment involves asking the question: did the researchersTABLE 1: Checklist to aid critical appraisal of a paper1.

Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley &Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd105 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARYdo things properly? Once you have established that thepaper addresses a relevant clinical question, and that anappropriate study design has been used, the methodologyshould be critically appraised for quality and the strength ofevidence of the work presented. This should consider whetherpotential sources of bias or confounding were addressed,whether the study was performed according to the originalprotocol and if appropriate statistical methods wereperformed correctly. In some instances, the reader may bepresented with insuf cient information to appraise the reliability and such papers should be interpreted with caution.Bias and confoundingMany of the aspects of design which need to be consideredto determine internal validity of a study are concerned withassessing whether systematic bias has been avoided orminimised throughout the study. Bias can be de ned as the systematic (nonrandom) error in design, conduct or analysisof a study resulting in mistaken estimates , and different study designs require different steps to reduce bias (see nextsection). Bias can occur due to the way populations aresampled, data are collected, or are analysed. Unlike randomerror, increasing the sample size will not decrease systematicbias. There are numerous types of bias (Sackett 1979; Dohooet al. 2009) but these can be considered under threeheadings: Selection bias: This bias occurs when the composition ofstudy subjects or participants in a research projectsystematically differs from the source population. There aremany different sub-types of this type of bias includingchoice of comparison groups, nonresponse bias (e.g.respondents differ compared with those who do notrespond in a questionnaire study), follow-up bias (loss tofollow-up is different between groups being compared),selective entry bias (e.g. use of horses that are currentlyracing is biased towards a healthy horse population) anddetection bias (controls wrongly classi ed when they have the disease of interest because, for example, they did notreceive the same examination protocol as cases). Information bias: Occurs when the outcomes, exposures ofinterest (factors measured) or other data are incorrectlyclassi ed or measured. This might be, for example, due to use of poor diagnostic criteria or tests, or differingapplication of data collection techniques or testsdepending on the outcome or exposure status of thesubject (for example, administering a questionnaireface-to-face for cases but by post for controls) Confounding bias: This is the mixing of the effects of two ormore factors. We might think that we are measuring theassociation between an exposure factor and an outcome,but the association we observe actually includes theeffect of one or more other variables. Hence, ourassessment of the association between the exposurefactor and the outcome is biased (or confounded). Forexample, if we wished to assess whether transport, as anexposure factor, was associated with the risk of colic, wewould need to take into account the effects of one ormore potential confounding factors (e.g. change offorage or change in time at pasture), that arehypothesised risk factors for colic but are also likely to beassociated with transport. To avoid bias and get anaccurate estimate of the effect of transport on colic, theseconfounding factors must be taken into account. Onceyou have identi ed the study type and considered the exposures and outcome factors, you can make a list ofpossible confounders and then examine the paper to seehow the authors have dealt with these (if at all). Particular types of bias may be more likely with speci c study designs, as outlined in the next section.

Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley &Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd106 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARYthat should be considered in the appraisal of these studies arealso summarised (adapted from Young and Solomon 2009):Randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The RCT is a prospective study designed to assess the effect of one (or more)treatments or interventions compared with a control groupthat may consist of no treatment, a placebo or acomparator treatment (for example, a current standardtherapy). Key design aspects that provide the best means ofavoiding bias include the process of random allocation totreatment groups, which aims to ensure that treatmentgroups are equivalent in terms of both known and unknownconfounding factors and hence any differences in outcomescan therefore be ascribed to the effect of treatment. Theprocess of blinding in RCTs, whereby participants and thosewho are assessing the outcomes (and in some cases alsothose analysing the data) are unaware of interventionassignment, reduces information or measurement bias. TheCONSORT guidelines (Anon 2017) provide a comprehensivechecklist speci cally for RCTs but speci c points for consideration should include: Was the process of treatment allocation properlydescribed and truly random? Were the groups comparable in all important aspectsexcept for the variable being studied? Were participants and researchers 'blinded 'to participants 'treatment group? Were primary and secondary outcome measures, properlydened and objectively assessed? Were all participants who were randomly allocated atreatment accounted for in the nal analysis? Papers describing comparative studies in which subjects are allocated to intervention or control groups in anonrandom manner are not randomised trials, and can betermed \"other controlled clinical trials \"(Greenhalgh 2001a) . There is a high risk of bias and confounding in these types ofstudies. For example, if a horse is not randomised to aparticular therapy or surgical procedure, a clinician maydecide upon the therapeutic/surgical treatment of thatpatient based on particular characteristics or speci c features of the disease, such as severity (leading to selectionbias); hence, any difference in outcome between the groupsmay relate to biased selection (grouping) of the patientsthemselves rather than the therapy/surgical interventionperformed. If the paper you are looking at is anonrandomised controlled clinical trial, you must use yourjudgement to decide if the baseline differences between thegroups are likely to have been so great as to undermineclaims regarding any differences (or lack of differences)ascribed to the intervention.Cohort studies. Cohort studies involve the follow-up of study participants with varying exposures forward, to observewhich animals develop the outcome(s) of interest (e.g.clinical disease or mortality), and to determine the effect ofexposures on the outcome. These studies are commonlyprospective, where data are speci cally collected for the purposes of the study, but may also be retrospective innature, using data that have been routinely collected foranother purpose e.g. clinical or race records. There is apotential for confounding in these types of studies and forbias due to loss to follow-up. Where potential confoundingfactors are identi ed prior to prospective cohort studies, these can be measured and taken into account in theanalysis, but in retrospective studies this may be dif cult or impossible if these factors were not measured or weremeasured poorly or inconsistently. Your checklist for thesestudies should consider: Is the study prospective or retrospective? Is the cohort representative of a de ned group/ population? Were all important confounding factors identi ed, adequately measured and adjusted for in the design oranalysis? Were all important exposures and outcomes measuredaccurately, objectively and equivalently in all the cohortsubjects (including irrespective of exposure status)? Were there any losses to follow-up and could this bias thendings? Case -control studies. Case -control studies are common in the equine literature and are ideal for investigation of riskfactors where the outcome of interest (e.g. a speci c disease) is rare and it would be impractical to perform a prospectivecohort study (e.g. too many horses needed/would take toolong to perform). In case -control studies, cases are only recruited once they have developed the outcome of interestand exposure data are then evaluated to determine whetherexposures of interest differ between the cases and controls.Appropriate control selection is often the most dif cult aspect of a case -control study as controls must come from the same population of cases to avoid bias. Controls should be subjectswho would have entered the study and become cases if theoutcome had occurred. Exposure data are often collectedby questionnaire or from existing records. Recall bias isanother potential issue in these types of studies where owners/carers cannot remember exact details about historicalfactors, and is a particular concern where this may differbetween groups (e.g. owners of horses who developed thedisease of interest may recall speci c factors more accurately than owners of control horses). In addition, recording ofsubjective rather than objective data may result in differentresponses from case or control owners leading to bias.Speci c points to consider in these studies are therefore: Were cases clearly de ned and eligibility and ascertainment described? Were controls appropriately selected and drawn from thesame population as the cases, using the same eligibilitycriteria? Were exposures measured equivalently for cases andcontrols? Is recall bias likely? Were all important confounding factors identi ed and adjusted for in design (for example by matching) oranalysis? Cross-sectional studies. These studies provide a 'snapshot 'in time to determine information (for example, diseaseprevalence) about a population of interest. Concurrentmeasurement of exposures of interest may also be used to \u00a92018 The Authors. Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley &Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Ltd107 2020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARYelucidate factors associated with the outcome. Speci c aspects of study design that should be considered include: Were the eligibility criteria and methods of selection of thestudy sample clearly de ned? Was a representative sample obtained (e.g. suf ciently high response rate) Were all relevant exposures, potential confounders andoutcomes measured accurately? Is it certain that the exposure of interest occurred prior todevelopment of the outcome? Statistical methodologyAlthough it is unlikely that most readers will be able tocritically evaluate every type of statistical analysis that maybe used in clinical studies, it is still important to be able tocritique key issues. If the statistical tests in the paper areuncommon, the authors should provide justi cation why they have used them and describe them in detail or include arelevant reference. For many studies, and in particular RCTs, a sample size calculation is a crucial prerequisite. The sample size should beclearly de ned and justi ed using appropriate calculations and should be big enough to have a high chance ofdetecting, as statistically signi cant, a worthwhile effect if it exists. If ultimately the study did not then reach the describedsample size, then it may be underpowered and lead toerroneous conclusions. The statistical methods used for any comparisons of the data should be clearly stated and any key assumptions, andevidence that these have been met, should be described(e.g. assumptions of normal distributions, multiple testing).Statistical tests are either parametric (i.e. they assume thatthe data were sampled from a normal distribution) ornonparametric (i.e. they do not assume that the data weresampled from any particular distribution). Inappropriatestatistical tests commonly used include use of parametrictests when data are not normally distributed, conductingmultiple testing and ignoring clustered data. Greenhalgh(2001b) provides further details, including some frequentlyused statistical 'tricks 'you should be aware of. The results section should include suf cient description of the data to enable readers to understand how the authorsarrived at their conclusions. This usually entails provision of pointestimates of effect (or difference) and measures of variation(usually the 95% con dence interval). The Equine Veterinary Journal provides useful guidelines and a statistical checklist(Christley 2015) but speci c points to consider include: Are groups comparable and, if necessary, adjusted forbaseline differences? Have the data been analysed according to the originalprotocol? Are statistical tests appropriate for the types of datadescribed? If the statistical tests in the paper are uncommon, whyhave the authors chosen to use them? Have con dence intervals been calculated and do the authors 'conclusions re flect these? Have assumptions been made about the nature anddirection of causality? Remember statistical associationdoes not provide direct evidence of causation.Strength of evidence and causalityOther factors that should be considered include aninterpretation of whether the results infer causality (Hill 1965): Temporal relationship -does the study demonstrate that the exposure/intervention preceded the disease/outcomeof interest? It is often not possible to demonstrate this incross-sectional or case -control studies. Strength of association -Is the relationship suf ciently 'strong 'to be clinically/biologically important? This can usually be evaluated by looking at the size of ratiomeasures (e.g. odds/risk ratio or differences in risk/rate ofdisease) and the precision of the estimate of effect.Whether the effect would still be suf ciently strong at either end of the 95% CI should be considered. Dose response -does the risk of disease or outcome of interest increase with increasing levels of the exposure?The most commonly cited example of this is in humanmedicine and the fact that the death rate from cancer ofthe lung rises linearly with the number of cigarettes smokeddaily. Demonstrating a strong dose -response relationship adds a great deal to the simpler evidence that anexposure increases the risk of disease. Noncausal explanations -does the association between an exposure and outcome of interest make biologicallyand epidemiological sense (and is it consistent with otherstudies or what is known about disease mechanisms) orcould this relationship be due to something else? How externally valid is the study and is it applicable topatients under your care? Once you have determined a study is of good quality (i.e.internally valid), the next step is to evaluate if the study hasexternal validity. External validity relates to how well the resultscan be generalised to other populations and in particular yourtarget population, i.e. patients under your care. The horsesstudied may differ from those under your care if, for example,they had more or less co-morbidities; they were of differentbreed or under very different management routines. Inaddition, you should consider if the outcomes assessed are ofrelevance to your patients, or if clinically relevant outcomeshave been ignored. Remember, however, a study can onlyhave external validity if it is also internally valid. Other factors to consider The ndings of the study should then be considered together with other evidence to determine whether they areconsistent with other studies or whether the ndings contradict previous studies. It is also important to considerwhether the authors have any potential con flicts of interest and, if so, whether these have been recognised. Forexample, commercial funding of a study might lead to acon flict of interest (e.g. if there is potential for increased sales of a commercial product based on study ndings, any negative ndings may not be presented). If potential con flicts of interest exist this should be addressed e.g. for commerciallyfunded research there should be a statement about whetherthe study design, analysis and interpretation of results wasperformed independently of the funding body. In addition,the reader should consider whether the study has beenperformed with appropriate ethical approval (Bertone 2013),including informed owner consent, although ethical \u00a92018 The Authors.

It limits pain through ciliary muscle relaxation,preventing synechia formation in horses. The potential forsystemic absorption, secondary inhibition of parasympatheticgut motility and consequent colic is a perennial concern. PICO question In horses with ocular disease, does topical treatment withatropine increase the risk of colic compared to no topicalatropine treatment? Search strategy Literature searches were conducted for articles published inEnglish on the MEDLINE database (inception to June 2017), theCAB Abstracts database (1973 to January 2017) and usingGoogle Search terms ','ocular ','ocular disease 'and 'colic '. Articles were included if they reported either systemic or ocularadministration of atropine in horses and evidence of subsequentcolic. Articles describing single cases or those that did notcontain original data (i.e. expert opinion) were excluded. Quality of evidence The searches identi ed 11 papers deemed relevant. The main ndings are shown in Table 1 . A series of experimental studies looking at the effects of intravenous atropine on intestinalactivity and colic dating from the 1980s are detailed inTable 1 . They show fairly convincingly that mild to moderate self-resolving colic can be induced by i.v. atropine. Giventhat it is a route not used for ophthalmic disease, thesepapers are not discussed further here. Can topical ocular atropine cause colic? Zekas et al. (1998) published results obtained by treating four healthy horses with topical ophthalmic atropine every 4h for 8 treatments, using a crossover design with salinecontrol. Intestinal myoelectric activity was measured usingpre-implanted electrodes, as well as calculating faecaltransit time using plastic beads and clinical assessment forcolic. Intestinal activity was suppressed in all horses and onehad increased transit time. Two of four horses colicked after16 and 32 h, respectively. Williams et al. (2000) supplied six horses with 1 mg topical atropine solution per hour for up to24 h, or until signs of colic developed. All horses lost audibleborborygmi for up to 18 h. Four colicked, after 11, 14, 22and 24 mg. Two of the four resolved without treatment in2 h; the other two received symptomatic pain relief,resolving pain in 2 and 6 h respectively. This experimentalscenario differs markedly to normal clinical application, e.g.high dose rates, the lack of ocular disease, pain or othersystemic drugs. The pharmacokinetics of ocular atropine has not been measured in horses, though it has in man. Lahdes et al. (1988) instilled 40 microlitres of 1% atropine solution (0.4 mg) to oneeye of healthy human volunteers and recorded systemicplasma levels for 90 min. Levels peaked at 8 min. No effecton heart rate, blood pressure or salivary secretion occurred,the main side-effect concerns in human medicine. Theextrapolated dose rate in this study was 0.005 mg/kg (80 kgbody weight), an order of magnitude lower than Ducharmeand Fubini (1983). The bioavailability of ocularly appliedatropine was measured by Kaila et al. (1999). They supplied 0.3 mg atropine, intravenously or ocularly, measuringsubsequent plasma concentrations. Mean bioavailability was63.5/C628.6%, range 19 -95%. Route of administration did not alter terminal half-life, whilst peak plasma concentration alsovaried widely, range 3 -60 min after ocular administration. Two features are noteworthy: (a) bioavailability was so high; (b)that so much individual variation in rate and degree ofabsorption occurred. The authors surmised that somevariation was due to over flow losses in the conjunctiva. Atropine also bonds to melanin: heavily pigmented eyesshow a slower onset and longer duration of action (Jaanuset al. 1989). What about horses with a painful eye treatedwith atropine? Within their review paper, McLaughlin et al. (1991) recorded a series of 15 horses hospitalised 5 -14 days for ocular disease. All received topical atropine at concentrations from 0.25 to1%, from twice daily to continuous lavage. No reducedintestinal motility or colic signs were observed. Patipa et al. (2012) published a retrospective review investigating risk factors for colic in 337 equids hospitalised forocular disease. The authors recognised that such horses wereexposed to many known risk factors for colic, e.g. transport,management changes, pain, general anaesthesia,prolonged systemic and topical drug treatment. Overall, 72of 337 horses colicked, nine needing surgery. Five colicfatalities occurred. Results of univariable analysis identi ed three signi cant colic risk factors: age (horses up to one or over 21 years), longer hospitalisation time, use of atropine.Atropine became nonsigni cant in the nal multivariable analysis OR 1.29; 95% CI 0.61 -2.7). Perhaps recognising that the rate of colic reported by Patipa et al. (2012) was unusually high, Scherrer et al. (2016) retrospectively compared 105 horses doi: 10.1111/eve.12881TABLE 1: Summary of the papers deemed relevant in answering the CAT: in horses with ocular disease, does topical treatment withatropine increase the risk of colic compared to no topical atropine treatment?Relevant papersFirst author,year Patient group Study type Outcomes Key results Study weaknessesDucharme and Fubini(1983)10 ponies supplied i.v. atropine at 2 lowerdose, at higher.Colic not ophthalmic route,healthy ponies,borborygmi used byintestinal electrodesExperimental cohort studyIntestinal suppressed colic occurred Intravenous not ophthalmic route,healthy Erhardt and delity recording used toassess motilityExperimental cohort studyIntestinal activity suppressed hNo colic Intravenous not ophthalmic route,healthy horses,recording only 1 h Zekas et al.

Of the 17 with colic, one needed surgery. Atropine was administered to 61/105 (58%) of horses with ocular disease and there was no association with the risk of colic, P =0.97. The authors noted that atropine was supplied at a maximum frequency of twice daily. Conclusions It is possible to induce mild reversible symptoms of colic through frequent administration of topical ocular atropine in normal healthy horses. Systemic bioavailabilty is potentially both high and rapid, even if individual horses vary naturally. Lower overall doses, conjunctival over flow losses, variation in pharmacokinetics and the presence of more potent risk factors probably explain why no retrospective clinical studies demonstrate an association between ocular atropine and colic in horses with ocular disease. Therefore, the use of ocular atropine at recommended dose rates for clinical ocular disease does not increase risk of colic.
