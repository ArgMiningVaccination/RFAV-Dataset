We are excited that you are a student in our professional program and I want to provide for you some information that I hope will be of assistance to you during your academic journey with us. A very important person during your time with us is your advisor. This individual is available to assist you in planning your program of studies and answer questions about future career options. I urge you to meet regularly with your advisor especially if you have any questions, concerns or need help with any academic, College, or campus issues. Faculty and staff are prepared to work with you on an individual basis and help guide you through your journey with us. Additional career information can also be found in our Administrative Offices in Fargo - Sudro 123 and by attending our Annual Career Fair in September. The graduate curriculum is designed to challeng e you and to teach you to become an independent learner and to work in collaborative interprofessional healthcare teams. Therefore, students are expected to take a very active role in their education and take responsibility for their own learning. Student active learning is a major emphasis of our program. You will be asked to apply your knowledge, dig for the answers to questions, communicate both verbally and in writing, critically think and problem -solve through case discussions, practice team -based care with students from other disciplines, and participate in numerous experiential activities. I encourage you to ask questions in class and to learn by understanding and applying the material presented rather than by simply memorizing factual information. Th e goal of our curriculum is for you to achieve the necessary life -long learning skills which will become important to you in your future career as a health professional to be able to \"keep up\" with the plethora of new information associated with our rapidl y changing health care system. Your ultimate success will be determined by the amount of effort you are willing to put into your academic studies. So work hard and give your best effort in all that you do. If you give us your best, you will receive the bes t in your educational experience with us. It will also be important that you learn more than just the technical skills of practicing in your discipline but that you also learn what it means to become a health professional and practice professionalism in ev ery and all situations. You will need to learn how to practice ethically, responsibly, with honesty, integrity, and good moral character and treating others (especially your patients) with compassion, caring, understanding, and respect which is expected o f any health professional. These will be the keys to your future success as a health professional. We desire to provide a positive learning environment for all students here within the College and we strive to continually improve our program. Students ar e a very important part of this process and we actively solicit your input and active participation through various formats. Students are elected from each class to serve on the Dean's Student Liaison Committee. This committee meets with the Senior Associa te Dean throughout the year to bring student concerns to the attention of the administration. In addition, the College holds a Deans' Open Forum each semester to allow students an opportunity to interact directly with the Dean (and his administrative leade rship team) on matters of interest and concern to students. And I also want you to know that my door is always open to you, so please don't hesitate to stop by my office if you need my assistance for anything. We encourage you to use these sources as well as visits with faculty, or any of the members of the staff in our Administrative Offices whenever you have issues that need to be brought to our attention. In addition, I encourage you to become actively involved with your profession by joining one of our student professional organizations. This is a great way to learn about what's going on within your profession and begin contributing to the advancement of your future professional career and practice. This \"Handbook\" is devoted to academic information to help enhance student success within our program. We hope you find it helpful to you. I wish you much success in your educational pursuits with us and in your later professional practice. Best wishes to you for a successful year! Charles D. Peterson, Pharm .D.

The information and polices p resented in this handbook complement a nd supplement information and polices pe rtinent to the North Dakota State University, the Graduate School (http://www.ndsu.edu/g radschool/), and the College of Health Professions (http://www.ndsu.edu/healthprofessions/ ) NDS U e-mail Address: The student's official NDS U e-mail address will be us ed for conveying and receiving information related to nursing courses. Students are responsible for monitoring their email for information. NURS ING PRO GRAM HISTORY The history of nursing education in Fargo dates back to the early 20th century when St. John's Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital each established a diploma school of nursing. The School of Nursing at St. John's closed and North Dakota State University (NDSU ) began an associate d egree nursing pr ogram in 196 9. In 198 6, NDS U and Concordia College (CC) began a collaborative bacca laureate nursing pr ogram. St. Luke's Hospital School of Nursing and the associate degree program at NDS U were discontinued. The co llaborative program was the Tri- College University Nursing Consortium (TCU). Students took nursing courses on the CC camp us and on the NDS U campus. In 1994 nursing faculty who had been employed by TCU became employees of either CC or NDS U but continued to teach on either or both campuses irrespective of faculty appointment. In 2001 Minnesota State University Moorhead (MSUM), which opera ted a baccalaureate program for registered nurses, joined the nursing co nsortium and a collaborative master's degree pr ogram in nursing was initiated. In 2005, the three und ergradu ate programs disassociated from the consortium and became independent of one another. NDS U initiated a doctor of nursing prac tice program in 200 5. In 2007 graduate programs at the three institutions became independent of one another. Nursing programs in the area cooperate with one anoth er in utilization of clinical sites, in addressing regional needs and through the sharing of teaching/learning resources. In June 2014, NDSU acquired the Sanford College of Nursing (SCON) located in Bismarck, N orth Dakota . SCON has been a well -respected, successful, free -standing nursing program affiliated with the Bismarck Hospital for over 100 years. The Bismarck program became kno wn as NDSU Nursing at Sanford Health . Fall semester, 2014 the pre -licensure BSN program on the Fargo campus expanded from admitting students each fall semester to admitting students each semester . In the fall semester of 2015, the DNP program expanded to t he Bismarck site. APPROVAL The family nurse practitioner (DNP ) program is approved by the North Dakota Board of Nursing. The DNP Program has been fully accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE ) until June 30, 2026 . MISSION NDSU SON Mission Statement : To advance nursing knowledge and develop dynamic nurse leaders who improve the health of all people, including underserved, rural, and diverse populations.

Students are responsible for monitoring their e-mail for information. ListServ A ListServ is used for communication between and among graduate nursing students and faculty. This is the primary mode of in-time information dissemination for the gradu ate nursing pr ogram. It is very important that every student read ListServ messages to receive up-to-date information. The Academic Assistant for the graduate program will add you to the relevant DNP ListServs. You will receive notification when you h ave been a dded to a ListServ list. Inform the Academic Assistant for the graduate program at (701) 231-5692 if you have any problems with the ListServ. GOVERNANCE AND OTHER POLICIES Student Governance Graduate students participate in the governance of the program through attendance at the graduate student forum meetings or through membership on SON committees. In add ition, students are encouraged to discuss aspects of courses or of the pr ogram with faculty whenever questions or concerns arise. 17 Academic Conduct Academic cond uct policies of the University and of the College apply to students in the program. Students are required to know policies on academic conduct and responsibility as well as institutional ac ademic requirements and procedures. College policies are at https://www.ndsu.edu/healthprofessions/college_information/policy_manual/ and institutional policies are at https://bulletin.ndsu.edu/graduate/policies .A signed agreement to this policy is maintained in the student's file and must be signed yearly. Students are expected to display the attributes of respect, autonomy, integrity, caring, justice, and professionalism in every acad emic and clinical set tings. Alcohol and Illegal Substances In accordance with state laws, the unlawful or unauthorized us e, possess ion, storage, manufacture, distribution, or sale of alcoholic beverages and any illicit drugs or drug paraphernalia is p rohibited in university/college buildings, any public campus area, housing units, university/college vehicles, or any university/college spon sored events either on or off camp us. Students who fail to comply with this policy will be subject to disciplinary and/or legal action. Additionally, students who at tend class or clinical acti vities und er the influence of, or suspected of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs will be a sked by the instructor to leave the classroom or clinical se tting immediately. Further sanctions may be applied. Student Appeals Proc edure Students are encouraged to seek resolution of a problem at the lowest appropri ate level, that is, the student should first discuss the problem with the person( s) directly involved. If this does not sati sfactorily resolve the problem, the student should seek resolution with faculty, DNP Director, Associate Dean for the College , and College Dean. In the event of an unsatisfactory resolution a formal grievance process may be initiated. The appeals process can be found at http://www.ndsu. edu/fil eadmin/policy/337.pdf for grades and at http://www.ndsu. edu/fil eadmin/policy/156.pdf for grievances of another nature. Questions regarding appeals may be e-mailed to NDSU .Policy.Manual@ndsu.ed u Infectious Diseases Student contact with clients in the health care setting is accompanied by risk of exposure to communicable disease as well as responsibility to avoid spreading co mmunicable disease. If you are exposed to body fluids while caring for a cl ient: 1. Wash the exposed area (not eyes) immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. Cover with a dry sterile dressing if an open wound is prese nt. 2. Notify nursing faculty immediately. 3. Complete an incident report (available from the clinical a gency); submit one copy to the agency supervisor and one to your clinical faculty. 4. Seek medical a dvice immediately from your choice of provider. Students are not covered under workers' c ompensation; costs of care are the responsibility of the student. COVID The School of Nursing adheres to the guidelines of the University regarding COVID. Most of our facilities have required all employees will need to be vaccinated against COVID; therefore, NDSU students will be required to have the vaccination for COVID. Students will need to provide proof of said vaccination to the academic assistant of the D NP Program. Application can be made to be exempt from this requirement for medical or religious reasons. Please check with the Academic Assistant on how to apply for exemptions. 18 Clinical Assignments Students will be ass igned to clinical sites acc ording to learning objectives of the co urse. Client characteristics such as age, race, religion, socio-economic level, or health status will not be a factor in clinical ass ignment unless there is an identified need for clinical e xperience related to one or more of these characteristics. A student who has a weakened immune status or who is pregnant is advised to inform the program director in writing whenever the co ndition becomes known. The director and/or the student will discuss the student's altered physical status with clinical faculty so that appropriate modifications of clinical ass ignments can be made. Such modification will be b ased on e vidence-based practice guidelines and/or written recommendations of the student's health care pro vider and will be d esigned to protect all parties at potential risk. Records The transcript which lists credits and grades for all courses taken is the permanent record of each student's progression. This record is confidential and is not released e xcept at the request of the student. Transcri pts are maintained by the Office of Registration and Records. An official transcript may be requested on-line from the Office of the Registrar to be sent to whomever the student designates. https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/records/transcripts/ An advisory folder for each student is kept on file in the School of Nursing while s/he is attending NDS U. The record contains ad mission papers, correspondence, evaluation forms, and other materials pertaining to the student. All advising/progression information is destroyed after the student's gradu ation. Records of health status and criminal background checks are maintained in a sep arate file during the student's enrollment in the program. These documents are destroyed on program completion. A reference folder containing final transcript, final evaluation, and requests for references is maintained in the School of Nursing for each graduate and for students dismissed from the program. CLINICAL COMPETENCY EXAMS All DNP students will need to take and pass a clinical competency exam at the end of each practicum course (excluding 850 P). Students who do not pass the exam will have one opportunity to repeat the exam. Students cannot progress to the next semester's courses without passing the clinical competency exam. CLINICAL PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS Direct patient/client care in a variety of clinical practice sites form an essential part of the NDSU nurse practitioner program. Clinical placements are an extension of classroom activities. Students are expected to perform in a professional manner and demonstrate growth towards professional pr actice. Students are expected to approach each clinical rotation with a willingness and desire to learn new clinical skills. All students are expected to be familiar with the American Nurses Association Code of Ethics and the American Association of Nurse Practitioner Scope and Standards of Practice for nurse practitioners and to abide by them at all times. ANA Code of Ethics https://www.nursingworld.org/coe -view -only AANP Scope of of Practice http://www.aanp.org/images/documents/publications/standardsofpractice.pdf NDSU DNP faculty determine whether a student has demonstrated reasonable competence in clinic al practice. If faculty evaluation of student performance or health status indicates that safe clinical care is unlikely, the faculty has the legal responsibility to deny, and will deny the student, access to further clinical learning experiences. The cou rsework and clinical practice requirements of the DNP program are significant. Students need time to contemplate, comprehend, and synthesize new knowledge. Faculty strongly encourage DNP students to consider their coursework and clinical time as equivalent to a full time job. We recommended that you work minimally, if at all. CLINICAL PLACEMENTS AND PRECEPTORS DNP students may have several practice sites and preceptors throughout the program and must be familiar with NDSU's policies regarding professional standards, physical requirements , and academic requirements. In addition, DNP students are required to be familiar with their cli nical organization's policies. Clinical placements involve the collaboration of many APRNs, physicians, physician assistants, and health care organizations. Numerous health care organizations have made available to NDSU the use of their facilities as well as their other agency personnel for the purpose of instructional experience. We appreciate the cooperation of many health care professionals. You play a major role in the determination of these relationships. The preceptor is ultimately accountable for the FNP student's patient care and performance in their clinical site. Consequently, the preceptor must approve student patient /client assessments and treatment plans and must be available on -site for consultation and approval. Patient communication, assessment, treatment plan, and all other aspects of patient care must be discussed with the precepto r before proceeding with care. When preceptor and student discuss patient/client management, the patient/client must not be placed in the position of responding to competing and contradictory messages. Clinical placements are arranged and coordinated by DNP faculty and staff. Several v ariables are considered, such as where the student lives, the course objectives, and available clinical sites. Most clinical placements will be in North Dakota and Western Minnesota. All clinical placements must be appro ved by the course coordinator (s). Faculty site visits, professional recommendations, and student feedback are important sources of information as faculty determine the appropriateness of establishing or maintaining clinical sites. Students are not to arrange their own clinical placements o r preceptors without faculty involvement or approval. Prior approval from the DNP program coordinator is required before students can be placed with preceptors or in clinical sites where a strong personal relationship exits. Again, students are not to arr ange clinical placements without the knowledge and involvement of the DNP faculty. Clinicians can serve as preceptors for NDSU DNP students if they meet the following criteria: 1. The preceptor is licensed by the state and certified by a professio nal organiz ation as required by the state to practice as an advance practice nurse, a physician assistant, or physician. 2. The preceptor has the educational preparation appropriate to their area(s) of practice and has at least one year of clinical experience in that ar ea of practice 3. The preceptor's practice is evidence based. 4. The preceptor's practice site has sufficient space available for the student to see patients, document, and discuss patient care with the preceptor. 5. The preceptor has adequate time available for joint student/preceptor patient visits, to discuss patient care, and to evaluate the student. 6. The preceptor provides care for appropriate patients consistent with the student learning needs. 7. The preceptor agrees to confer with faculty per phone, email and/ or on -site visits. (Travel to clinical sites and living arrangements (if needed) are the student's responsibility. 20 Occasionally, DNP students will also be required to spend time (1 -2 days) each semester with a DNP faculty at the faculty's practice site. The DNP faculty will evaluate student clinical progress through preceptor communication, mock clinics, direct observation, and through other learning activities. If students have concerns related to a preceptor or clinical site, the student is responsible for discussing the concern with the clinical coordinator(s). Students are encouraged to contact their preceptor at least two (2) weeks before the clinical experience is scheduled to begin. Students should plan to provide the clinical site with a current resume, skills record, and proof of immunizations. Students should ask the preceptor to recommend the \"Top 5 -10 diagnoses\" seen in the preceptors practice. Knowing the common diagnoses allows the student to research and prep are for the clinical rotation. Students are required to post their proposed clinical schedule and the hours at the clinical site to the Typhon tracking system. The preceptor and faculty coordinator should also receive a written copy of the schedule. A signed, current clinical contract between the agency/preceptor and the NDSU School of Nursing must be in place prior to starting a clinical rotation. A current, active, unencumbered RN license is also required and a copy must be on file at the School of Nursing prior to clinical participat ion. Students are required to have proof of current immunization, and annual TB test results on file at the School of Nursing prior to clinical practice. In the assigned clinical site, the student will provide preceptor supervised patient health care. Th e student's clinical experiences should build on learned advanced assessment skills, diagnostic reasoning, evidence -based practice, while providing holistic care to patients of a variety of age, gender, race, culture, economic status, and state of health . The individual student is accountable for incorporating and building upon information learned in previous courses and clinical experiences . Providing health care is an interdisciplinary process, and students are encouraged to communicate and consult with other disciplines including ancillary staff, nurses, pharmacists, specialists, and others involved in patient care inside and outside of the clinical site. Students should take the initiative in this process in a manner consistent with professional courte sy, demonstrating respect in all communications. Professional courtesy requires the use of professional titles in formal and patient care settings. ATTENDANCE POLICY Attendance at clinical is required. No missed hours of clinical will be accrued in student s' clinical placements. Students are required to be at the clinical site during their scheduled clinical hours. The student must accrue the required number of clinical hours per semester or they will not progress. All hours will be made up before students may progress. If the student has an unforeseen absence from clinical because of illness, family emergency, or weather, it is the student's responsibility to contact the preceptor and the course coordinator (s) as soon as possible. On a scheduled clinical da y requiring travel away from home, the student is accountable for assessing the safety of road travel in light of climactic conditions. The student is required to make up time lost and is responsible to reschedule the clinical day ano ther time during the s emester. If the student is unable to reschedule the hours at the clinical site, arrangements are to be made with the course coordinator (s) to find an alternate clinical site. VALID CLINICAL ACTIVITIES There are many educational activities that can occur i n a clinical setting; however, the only activities that count toward required clinical hours for each DNP course include those that involve or are related to direct patient care. Examples of direct patient assessment activities include: seeing a patient (a lone or with the preceptor); performing a patient -related procedure (e.g., microscopy, suturing); reviewing a chart or a clinical reference regarding a patient scheduled to see or have seen; discussing a patient's plan of care with the preceptor or another member of the patient's care team; reviewing a patients lab, cardiology, or radiology results; and documenting the patient's care. Examples of non -patient related activities that do not count toward the required clinical hours include: simulated or mock p atients, educational conf erences or presentations, etc. Questions regarding the activities that count or do not count as a direct patient care should be discussed with the course coordinator (s). If the clinical site 21 is experiencing a particularly slow day and a student is asked to go home, they may not count the scheduled hours; only the direct patient care hours can be counted. If the student's assigned clinical site consistently has a limited number of direct patient experiences, the student is responsibl e to contact the course coordinator (s) to find additional clinical hours at that clinical site or to locate an alternate placement. MAXIMUM WEEKLY HOURS Reflection is a critical aspect of clinical education. After each clinical day, students are expected to reflect upon and review the literature related to the patient's encounters during the clinical experience. Spending too many hours in clinical at once takes away from this critical reflection and development time and undermines the learning process. Thus, students should limit clinical hours to 32 or less per week so that there is time for reflection and to absorb information. ATTIRE/DRESS CODE Personal Appearance/Professional Dress General Guidelines Professional appearance instills confidence in others, sends a clear message that the student is credible and reflects self -confidence and good health. The following are minimal expectations for professional appearance for a School of Nursing (SON) DNP Student: The Agency's guidelines will be followed. Students are required to follow facilities' policies regarding appearance and dress. The course instructor is responsible for sharing the appearanc e and dress expectations with clinical instructors and student during clinical orientation . The overall appearance will convey an image of professionalism. Fingernails will be unaugmented (i. e., no acrylic or gel nails), short, and without enamel. Jewelry will be minimal such as a watch, wedding ring, engagement ring; no dangling jewelry. Strong odors including, but not limited to, perfumes, colognes, aftershaves, or cigarette smoke, are not permitted (this includes strongly scented lotions). Tattoos may n eed to be covered per facility policy. Gum chewing is not appropriate in the clinical site, the classroom, or other places in which one is in a nursing role. Sanctions . The student who does not adhere to the personal appearance/professional dress guideli nes in a clinical area will receive a warning for the first violation. A second offense may warrant dismissal from the clinical area for the day with the published corresponding effect on his/her course grade. PREPARATION In addition to appropriate attire, students must be prepared to engage in clinical care. Students should bring a stethoscope, a laptop computer and/or mobile device, and pertinent clinical textbooks. CLINICAL LOG Students are required to maintain a clini cal/time log using Typhon Group Computerized Tracking System. No identifying data should be included on the log (see Confidentiality section). Students are expected to enter log data into the Typhon system immediately after completing each clinical day. Th e Typhon system has been set so that students cannot add or edit clinical data 14 days after the clinical date has passed. PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS A variety of mechanisms will be used to evaluate student clinical performance including clinical competency exams, preceptor evaluations, mock clinics, and case studies. Additionally, clinical faculty will maintain regular contact with preceptors via phone, email, zoom , and/or site visits. 22 IMMUNIZATION/HEALTH POLICY The NDSU graduate nursing program requires that students provide evidence of the following: 1. General health status. 2. Tuberculin test (PPD) annually. A two -step skin tuberculosis testing or blood test for tuberculosis is required prior to the second semester in the program. A one -step skin test is re quired annually thereafter ; provided ; however, the test is administered no later than exactly one year after the last TB test was administered. 3. MMR immunization or proof of immunity through serum rubella screening for antibodies. (MMR not necessary if student's birth year is prior to 1956). 4. Completion of Hepatitis B series, documented immunity through serum Hepatitis B screening for antibodies or declination. 5. Tetanus diphtheria (acellular) pertussis immunization (Tdap) within the last ten (10) years. 6. Varicella. Proof of immunity is preferred. Student may also show proof of the series of vaccinations. 7. Current Influenza vaccination by October 29th annually . 8. Proof of COVID Immunization. The purpose for requiring evidence of health status and current immun ization is to provide a safe environment and protect fellow students, faculty, health care agencies, and patients from communicable diseases. Proof of health status and immunization is also required by health care agencies accepting students for clinical experiences. Procedure: 1. The student is responsible to have his or her health care provider complete the Health Record and return the completed form to the Academic Assistant prior to beginni ng the Graduate nursing program. 2. The student must resubmit a heal th care status report as necessary during their program of study if any changes in health status should occur that could affect performance as a student. 3. The student is required to submit proof of current: tuberculosis status (PPD or blood test); Hepatitis B immunity or Hepatitis B or immunization; Tdap immunization; varicella immunity; covid, and influenza immunization. 4. When health requirements of a clinical agency exceed NDSU graduate nursing requirements, the student will be advised of additional information or immunization requirements prior to the start of clinical experience in that agency. The student will be respo nsible for providing the required additional information to the Academic Assistant prior to starting clinical experience at that agency. The Academic Assistant will ensure that the agency has the required information prior to student placement in that agen cy. 5. The student is responsible to inform the Program Director of any changes in health status while they are a student at NDSU. Any student not meeting health status reporting requirements will not be permitted to begin classes, attend clinical, and/or co ntinue in the program until proof of health care status is received.
