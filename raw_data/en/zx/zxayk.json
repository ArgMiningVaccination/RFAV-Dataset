Therapeutic treatment known as colonic therapy, colonic irrigation, or colonic hydrotherapy has been practiced in some form for thousands of years. Since the 19th century, it has gained popularity in Europe and the United States, and it is increasingly used to treat health conditions such as incontinence, contribute to ostomy care, and cleanse the colon prior to surgery. Practitioners with appropriate colonic therapy education use specialized equipment to administer gentle infusions of warm, purified water into the colon. This helps to remove toxins and waste products, and it may even improve overall immune wellness. How does colon hydrotherapy work? Colonic therapy can be a powerful therapeutic tool in traditional medical office settings, in addition to alternative treatment centers, health spas and massage therapy practices. A treatment session usually lasts 45 minutes to an hour, during which the practitioner will use advanced hydrotherapy equipment to introduce water into the colon. Typically, the colon is rinsed using about 25 to 35 gallons of water. A separate tube removes the water along with any debris. In addition, the colonic therapist may use other treatment methods such as abdominal massage or relaxation techniques.
