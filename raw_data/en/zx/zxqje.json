Jane will then do iridology, looking closely into your eyes, which can tell her more about what's going on inside your body. Jane will then come up with a treatment plan designed just for you. This could include dietary and lifestyle advice, prescribing of nutritional or herbal supplements or booking in an energy healing consultation. A follow up naturopathic consult is usually scheduled for 2-3 weeks later and goes for 1/2 an hour to an 1 hour. Subsequent appointments are dependent on what the treatment plan requires. An energy healing session begins as you make yourself comfortable, relaxing on a massage table. You will be fully clothed and Jane will be sitting nearby. There is soft lighting and relaxing music is playing while Jane talks you through a guided relaxation technique. Jane then tunes into your energy and what follows is an 'intuitive conversation'. Jane is guided by your soul on what you need help to heal - past hurts, old conditioning, repeating patterns that are no longer serving you and the session concludes with setting new intentions for the future. You can ask questions at any time during the session. The initial session is 1.5 hours and subsequent visits are 1 hour. The frequency of visits will be determined by each individuals healing journey. You will feel a difference after just one session. "}
