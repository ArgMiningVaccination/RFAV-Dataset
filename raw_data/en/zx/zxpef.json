Do your friends seem to sail through flu season unaffected while you constantly get sick? Then maybe you need to consider boosting your immune system. We tend to pay more attention to the health of our immune system during the winter, when colds and flu are all around us. But the truth is, our immune system continually works hard to defend us all year long from infection and disease. How the Immune System Works Your [immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279364/) protects your body from infectious germs. Through highly complex and adaptive processes, a healthy immune system is always at work, shielding you from infections by identifying and destroying unfriendly microorganisms. Your immune system also helps you build immunity so that when you encounter certain invading germs again, you can fight them more effectively the next time around, often without even getting sick at all. How to Optimize the Immune System There is no single pill or supplement you can take that will optimize your immune system. However, implementing these healthy lifestyle habits can help to improve your immunity for life. Go for a walk: Being inactive can not only leave you feeling sluggish, but it can also make your immune system sluggish. Exercise, on the other hand, helps boost immunity. Eat a healthy diet: Proper nutrition is needed for your immune system to work well. An unhealthy diet can lead to weight gain, but even worse, it can leave you more susceptible to a number of health problems that can also drag your immune system down. Get enough sleep: Poor sleeping habits may not only leave you feeling exhausted during the day, but will also leave you vulnerable to illnesses, including colds, flu, and other infections. Practice stress management: When your body is under on-going stress, you are more vulnerable to everything from the common cold to major diseases. Establish relationships: Research has shown that people with close friendships and strong support systems tend to be healthier than those who do not. Include red light therapy: Much like a plant, the human body reacts positively to light. When light energy hits your skin, the energy is absorbed, providing your body with a cascade of benefits. From a Rouge customer: I'm a 60 yr old oilfield man who heard about red light therapy listening to podcasts on health related topics, I'm on no meds but have inflammation and some arthritis if I don't eat right. I purchased the Rouge Pro on a Friday and arrived on the following Tuesday, I was sick that day and having trouble with my lungs, felt like bronchitis, a nasty cough, I used the light for a short session that evening and again the next day I noticed an improvement in how my lungs felt fairly quickly and slept well Wednesday night. This is nothing short of a miracle in my mind. We are very pleased with this purchase. What is Red Light Therapy? Red light therapy is a natural, non-invasive technique that has the ability to promote the body's own immune responses. The use of light therapy is classified as photobiomodulation; it is a safe and effective procedure that uses red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) which diffuse wavelengths through a person's skin. Commonly referred to as low-level laser therapy (LLLT), biostimulation (BIOS), or photonic stimulation, red light therapy has shown significant potential in improving our overall health and well-being in a number of ways. For more information on red light therapy and how it can improve your health, take a look [here](https://rouge.care/pages/what-are-the-benefits-of-red-light-therapy). How Does Red Light Therapy Work? Low-level light at various wavelengths penetrates tissue to different depths, which stimulate beneficial changes at the cellular level. It is a gentle, non-invasive, and painless therapy with no known side-effects. Studies conducted on red light therapy have shown it can be used as a beneficial, drug-free approach in the treatment of a number of medical and cosmetic conditions in the area of neurology, physical rehabilitation, and dermatology. Light Therapy Boosts Your Immune System There are countless home remedies and over-the-counter medications that claim to boost your immune system, but one approach that has proven to be notably effective is the use of photobiomodulation,or red light therapy. Numerous studies have demonstrated a correlation between [photobiomodulation and a healthier immune system.](https://www.practicalpainmanagement.com/treatments/complementary/lasers/immune-modulating-effects-therapeutic-laser) [Light therapy ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8126975/)has been proven to support the optimum operation of the immune system. Primarily, red light therapy energizes your body as a whole. Your body then disperses that energy in the most efficient way, to keep itself healthy and in balance. The positive effects of red light therapy on the immune system include: Promoting ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) production. Mitochondria convert food molecules into energy in the form of ATP. But red light boosts this performance, allowing cells to function optimally, replicate successfully, and fight any infections. Stimulating angiogenesis. Creating more capillaries improves blood flow throughout the body, which helps to bring nutrients to cells and remove cell-damaging and potentially toxic waste. Improved thyroid health. The thyroid hormones, specifically T(3) and T(4), are modulators of the immune response. Hypo and hyperthyroid disorders negatively affect the activity of macrophages, leukocytes, natural killer cells, and lymphocytes; restoring normal thyroid activity will [positively affect the activity of these immune cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29227581/). Stimulation of the lymphatic system, which is imperative for a strong immune system. Stem cell activation,which are then mobilized to become active in the immune system response. Increased melatonin production,which encourages more restful sleep. Better moods. Depression, anxiety, and stress have all been linked to low immune responses. You may not be conscious of it, but our body has an unbelievable capacity to heal itself. It is one of the most essential functions, right up there with regulating blood pressure and digesting our food. From recovering after a fall or injury to dealing with bacteria, viruses and toxins, we have an indispensable, built-in system designed to defend and repair ourselves. But we don't generally think of engaging our healing abilities when we are sick. We just presume it failed us, and that the best option is to attack the condition, most often with medication or, in more serious cases, surgery. Most of us are not even aware that there are alternative, more natural ways to respond to health and illness concerns. I admittedly wasn't until I started using red light therapy for neck and shoulder pain. Not only did it work more effectively than the pain medication I was taking, but it also improved my health in a myriad of other ways.
