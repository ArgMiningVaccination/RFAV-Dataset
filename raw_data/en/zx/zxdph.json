RSV Vaccine - Respiratory Syncytial Virus | Walgreens Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is a common respiratory virus that typically causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Most people recover within two weeks. However, certain groups, such as infants, young children, and older adults, are more likely to develop severe infections including bronchiolitis (an inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia. While many people associate RSV with babies and young children, older adults can also get the virus and are at risk for developing complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that 60,000-160,000 older adults in the United States are hospitalized with RSV each year and 6,000-10,000 die due to the viral infection.
