To most of us, it seems ludicrous that they cling to this notion, especially after scores of scientific evidence have proven that vaccines are entirely safe and do not cause autism. Now, it appears that the efforts of a certain group of anti-vaxxers have backfired, [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/anti-vaxxers-accidentally-fund-study-showing-theres-no-link-between-autism-and-379245?rel=most_shared1) reported. The anti-vaccination group, known as SafeMinds, funded a recent [study](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/40/12498.full.pdf) published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that examined the link between autism and vaccines over the course of six years \u2014 and the study found no link at all, perhaps to their frustration. The researchers examined 79 infant monkeys divided into six groups; two of the groups were given vaccines containing thimerosal \u2014 an antiseptic and antifungal component that was removed from vaccines recently. Two other groups were given the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine \u2014 which is often cited by anti-vaxxers as a source of autism \u2014 and the last two groups were given a saline injection as a control. Their conclusion was straightforward: Neither the thimerosal-containing vaccines nor the MMR vaccines changed the behavior of the monkeys, and they didn't contribute at all to any shrinking of the hippocampus or other regions of the brain (which has, in the past, been associated with autism). \"No behavioral changes were observed in the vaccinated animals,\" the authors write, \"nor were there neuropathological changes in the cerebellum, hippocampus, or amygdala. This study does not support the hypothesis that thimerosal-containing vaccines and/or MMR vaccine play a role in the etiology of autism.\" Despite the crystal clear conclusion, SafeMinds continues to argue that the results are \"controversial,\" still unclear, and open to interpretation. \"SafeMinds has concerns about changes in the study design protocol and analysis that may have led to these contradictory results,\" the group said in a [statement](http://www.safeminds.org/blog/2015/10/05/why-arent-i-surprised-that-the-media-got-it-wrong-again/). \"We are in the process of collecting and reviewing additional information regarding this study.\" Fortunately, recent polls have shown that the numbers of warring [anti-vaxxers are declining](https://www.medicaldaily.com/anti-vaxxers-decline-new-poll-finds-parents-are-gaining-confidence-benefits-vaccines-341860). But there's still a lot of work to be done to convince those who still cling to the vaccine-autism link. To start, it's important to remind them that vaccines are [incredibly important to the health of all children](https://www.medicaldaily.com/how-can-we-convince-anti-vaxxers-kids-need-get-vaccinated-show-them-why-its-important-345930); but perhaps we can also note that even when they fund their own studies, the science says it all.
