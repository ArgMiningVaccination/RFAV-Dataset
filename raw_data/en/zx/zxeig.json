If I'm being 100 percent honest, the entire reason I got into healing crystals was because they're pretty and shiny. I wanted a carefully curated collection of gems on my nightstand\u2014and in a singing bowl and [scattered about my desk](http://www.self.com/gallery/9-vibrant-ways-to-decorate-your-desk)\u2014that could balance my insanely frazzled New York City energy and lighten my heavy spirit. It all started with rose quartz, purported to help with all matters of the heart. Not just your relationships with others, but your relationship with yourself too, something I'm always working on. Plus, they were [millennial pink](http://www.self.com/story/pantone-color-of-the-year-2016). I first noticed the blush-pink stone sparkling in some of my favorite yoga studios. When I heard they could heal my heart chakra and repair my heinous lack of self-esteem, I couldn't help but pick up a palm stone, and then another, and then, well, a LOT more healing crystals from there. Turns out rose quartz is a gateway stone, and I got hooked. Honestly, I don't know. You can ask eight different people and get eight answers, but the gist of it is that various stones have healing energies that align with imbalances in one of the seven (or nine, or 13, again, depending on who you ask) chakras, or the spiritual energy centers corresponding to nerve bundles, major organs, and our \"psychological, emotional, and spiritual states of being,\" [according to the Chopra Center](http://www.chopra.com/articles/what-is-a-chakra#sm.0001tv68k3m9bef6zuq210324ilqs). When these energy centers are misaligned, or blocked, millennia-old logic explains, energy becomes stagnant and can manifest as physical illness or throw you off emotionally. \"Crystal healing is the use of a crystal's vibration to affect the human energy field. Crystals act as a conduit for healing\u2014allowing positive, healing energy to flow into the body while pushing negative, toxic, disease-causing energy out,\" says Audrey Kitching, a crystal healer and the founder of [CrystalCactus.com](http://www.crystalcactus.com), where my obsession with pretty crystals was magnified by ten million because of how chic her packaging is. After ordering a bottle of her [Rose Quartz Venus Love Bath](https://crystalcactus.com/collections/beauty/products/crystal-venus-love-bath) (I'll be a romantic until the bitter end, not sorry) and enjoying the shit out of the two soaks the jar provided, I was ready to go all-in on crystals. Considering all the messed up things I have going on right now in my life (from headaches and anxiety to stomachaches and a never-fully-disappeared eating disorder), I figured I could use all the healing I could get. I was attracted to the giant hunks of amethyst in each of the three rooms at the local [yoga studio](http://www.self.com/gallery/yoga-studios-change-how-think-about-yoga) and checked that baby out next. Amethyst, considered one of the most important stones to have in your collection, is essential for cleansing and purifying, and enhancing an individual's own intuition and sense of spiritual freedom, according to Kristin Petrovich, author of [Elemental Energy](http://www.elementalenergybook.com/) and founder of the crystal energy-infused [Sjal skincare line](https://sjalskincare.com/). So I bought myself a piece of amethyst. And some clear quartz, the universal \"white light\" of crystals, that's unanimously agreed upon to be the most important crystal to have on hand as it is a conductor of energy, which can amplify the energies of all other stones, says Petrovich. You can also sub it for any other stone during any healing ritual, she adds, because of its colorlessness. I also bought some citrine to make me happier, some black tourmaline to ground myself and prevent my at-home [tech](http://www.self.com/topic/tech) from going haywire, plus some aquamarine for my throat chakra so I could vocalize my feelings better. If I had to add up the number of stones I have at the moment (which I technically can't, since I have a pound each of raw rose quartz and tumbled moonstone on the way for some sexy, feminine AF bath time), I currently own about 25 sweet pet rocks. Some are smooth and tumbled and were Amazon Prime'd because of my need for instant gratification, others are raw and handpicked at local shops\u2014shout out to Sacred Waters in LIC and Maha Rose in Greenpoint\u2014after spending too much time combing through the spiritual offerings. And then, of course, comes the rest of the stuff you should probably have if you're going to get into crystal healing: a smudging kit (with options\u2014more on that later), essential oils, incense, spiritual objects, mala beads, a Himalayan salt lamp to help \"detoxify\" everything ( [which I fully know is B.S.](http://www.self.com/story/myths-detoxing-totally-false)) and way too much more I shouldn't tell you about. Like the gorgeous glass pyramid I spent 30 bucks on just to display my less-than-$30-each crystals in. I've spent probably a few hundred bucks by now on my whole crystal habit, but you know, I'm not the type of girl who goes halfway. When I fall in love with a hobby or [take on a challenge](http://www.self.com/story/i-lived-on-nothing-but-soylent-for-a-week-kinda-and-this-is-how-it-went), I go all out. I'm not much for balance, which is probably why healing crystals are particularly perfect for someone like me. In order to reap the benefits of your stones, you can employ a variety of (yes, dubious) techniques. \"Everyone will gravitate towards which unique crystal path is best for them,\" Kitching tells SELF. \"You could bathe with them, leave some under your pillow, use them in tandem with the lunar cycles, meditation on specific questions, infused in beauty and body products\u2014the possibilities are truly endless.\" Petrovich believes the healing powers can be extreme, too: When she first start studying crystals and came down with a fever, she laid a geode coaster atop her head, and after some time, \"started feeling an energy in [her] head and the pressure. I felt the illness lifting. Like, moving out.\" Though Petrovich personally and professionally swears by the curative power of crystals, I couldn't find a doctor who would verify that a geode could fix a fever, and I doubt you'd be able to find one who would ever prescribe you amethyst for a headache. Indeed, a [2009 study published in the journal PLOS One](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005192) examined the efficacy of various traditional medicines, home remedies, and alternative treatments and concluded that when it comes to \"the 'healing' power of crystals\" there is \"no evidence that these treatments ever worked, nor any suggestion\" that they might. Harsh. But that doesn't keep Petrovich, or other crystal healing proponents, or me, from having faith\u2014or at least giving it a damn shot. As someone who frequently gets [headaches](http://www.self.com/story/constant-headaches-health-meaning) (unquestionably from stress; I'm a ball of nerves and deadlines), I was more than willing to pile a whole slew of amethyst stones on my face to see if they'd help me. The purple stone is connected to your third-eye chakra, which when blocked, is associated with headaches. (Reductress once [excellently joked](http://reductress.com/post/the-best-crystals-to-get-you-through-another-year-without-health-insurance/) that healing crystals are freelancers' health insurance.) So the last time I got a killer headache, I laid out on the couch, grabbed the softest blanket I own, and placed an amethyst directly on my third eye, with others clustered around the actual pain point, my left temple. According to Petrovich, it takes about twenty minutes for the stones' energy to start working with your own body's, so you need to give it some time, at least about 45 minutes, she recommends. I'm not sure if it was the [Williams-Sonoma induced coziness, the power of a power nap](http://www.self.com/gallery/nap-lover-gifts), or the gemstones themselves, but 75 minutes later my headache was GONE. And considering how bad the pain can get, I couldn't believe how clear headed I felt. There are products you can buy that are infused with amethyst designed to work their magic on headaches, like [Aquarian Soul Headache Magic Oil](https://shop.pistilsnursery.com/products/headache-magic) ($14), which is a rollerball infused with essential oils and amethyst and quartz crystals. In addition to the laying on of crystals, you can also make an elixir for bath water or put them in spring water to drink\u2014use whichever crystals may have the benefits you're looking for. So if you're a heart-chakra, rose-quartz romantic like me, you make hella rose quartz elixir. (Hence that Amazon order I told you about earlier.) If you do this, be sure it's not a stone that is toxic when wet, such as malachite (a green stone for the heart chakra\u2014that one I just leave near me when I'm bathing with my millennial pink babes), or one that's too soft and will flake, like selenite, used to provide mental clarity for the crown chakra. Crystals have naturally found their way into many a revenue stream, including more fashion and beauty items than even an addict like me can keep up with. I'm currently wearing an [Ani & Alex rose quartz pendant necklace](http://www.alexandani.com/rose-quartz-expandable-necklace.html) and locally-crafted bracelets made of moonstone, self-esteem-boosting rhodochrosite, and calming white howlite. As with everything these days, there are crystal subscription boxes, too, like Crate Joy's Mystic Muse Box ($45/month, [cratejoy.com](https://www.cratejoy.com/subscription-box/mystic-muse/)), as well as curated offerings. Spencer Pratt\u2014you know, of MTV fame\u2014has gone on not only become a crystal collector (and [a pal](https://twitter.com/rjacoby13/status/880191553142226947)), but also offers his very own 5-Piece Starter Metaphysical Crystal Kit ($25, [innervisioncrystals.net](https://www.innervisioncrystals.net/products/starter-metaphysical-crystal-set-5-pcs)). And don't even get me started on all the beauty products that have come from the New Age trend. We've seen geode-inspired liquid highlighters from drugstore brands, like the [Pacifica Rainbow Crystals Liquid Mineral Strobe Multi-Use Highlighter](http://www.ulta.com/rainbow-crystals-liquid-mineral-strobe-multi-use-highlighter?productId=xlsImpprod15971001) ($13), along with niche skin-care of Aussie model [Miranda Kerr](http://www.self.com/topic/miranda-kerr)'s skin-care line, is based on her own love for rose quartz and aromatherapies associated with the heart chakra; she reportedly keeps the stone next to her nightstand and in her purse. Same, Miranda, same. And if I wasn't basic or millennial enough, I managed to find a bottle of ros\u00e9 wine just in time for the summer holiday whose entire concept from varietal blend to bottle design was inspired by\u2014you guessed it\u2014rose quartz. [SAVED 2016 Magic Maker Ros\u00e9](https://www.bottlecollective.com/2016-SAVED-Magic-Maker-Rose-Wine-California?pageID=6DAA0FEC-F779-62C5-2753-CB4C3EA4BC13&sortBy=Price&maxRows=500&), which is available for just $20, is crazy refreshing. Kinda like a rose quartz bath is. Like my laptop or iPhone ( [or Donald Trump](http://www.self.com/story/donald-trump-excuse-on-exercise)), crystals contain a finite amount of energy and need to be recharged when depleted. Except that they don't have a lightning plug. To charge stones before using, Kitching explains, you can leave them overnight under a full or new moon, submerge them in a glass bowl of spring water, or bury them under the dirt overnight. My favorite way, though, and arguably the most ~New Age~ way, is to smudge your stones. Smudging, by unofficial definition, is engulfing your stones in the smoke from an herb or wood\u2014commonly sage or Palo Santo\u2014to absorb and clear out any negative energies. As an alternative, you can also use incense or dried herbs. If you're stressed, try smudging lavender on a piece of sodalite, placing it on your third eye, and lying down for an hour. You can thank me later. I think of smudging like a musician retuning his guitar before a concert, but with some smoke and crystals. I open the window when I cleanse mine to let negative energies escape as I watch the smoke waft around each stone and because my husband is not here for the smell of sage. Listen, there's no way these things have energetic charge capable of healing anything but a couple hundo burning a hole in my wallet. But they make me feel better. When my heart's feeling broken, I'll keep malachite and quartz in one pocket and slew of millennial pink stones in the other. And when I'm feeling a bit unbalanced, I'll squeeze my smooth set of red jasper stones. I love carrying them. And I love making baths with them. I'll make even prettier baths once my bulk order of rose quartz and moonstone arrives this week. Is there any way these stones, baths, elixirs and the like are actually healing me? No, but I'm making them do things. My love of crystals has lead me to embrace all kinds of mindful, spiritual habits, which happen to fit in perfectly with my hippie-dippie (if slightly ditzy) personality. I became far more self-aware about my own feelings, actions, and reactions as I learned more about the chakras and the various practices now associated with them, such as reiki, yoga, and meditation. There's no question the crystals have reinforced existing good habits, plus created a few more positive spiritual ones: I've gotten into reading tarot cards daily and creating monthly intentions with each new moon. Basically, I'm forcing them to work their magic on me, which can pretty much only be done when I make the decision to [care for myself](http://www.self.com/topic/self-care). The power of my own mind, you know? You gotta believe.
