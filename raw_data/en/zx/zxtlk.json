The review of this report was overseen by Bobbie Berkowitz, Columbia University, and Joan B. Rose, Michigan State University. Appointed by the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine, they were responsible for making certain that an independent examination of this report was carried out in accordance with institutional procedures and that all review comments were carefully considered. Responsibility for the final content of this report rests entirely with the authoring committee and the institution. Preface Healthy, Resilient, and Sustainable Communities After Disasters is intended as both a call to action and an action guide for maximally leveraging the resources associated with disaster planning and recovery toward realizing healthier communities. The report is premised in the study committee's appreciation of the importance of engaging all community stakeholders and available resources thoughtfully, creatively, and appropriately in working synergistically to address the unacceptable reality that the nation's communities, and its people, are less healthy than they can and should be. The report is intended to focus the attention of those individuals and organizations involved in planning for and carrying out disaster recovery activities and those involved in planning for and building healthy communities on leveraging the millions and sometimes billions of dollars associated with disaster events more effectively toward maximizing healthiness. It would seem intuitive that a community confronted by the tragic necessity of rebuilding roads, houses, health care institutions, parks, and other critical elements of its infrastructure would intentionally seek to optimize health status as one of its major priorities. Unfortunately, as documented in this report, creating healthy communities usually is not high on the list of disaster planning or recovery efforts, and too often a significant gulf exists between the nation's dedicated disaster officials and their equally praiseworthy health leader counterparts. In this context, this report is intended to highlight the key opportunities that disaster recovery offers to advance the social goal of maximizing the health of communities, and to provide practical recommendations for how diverse stakeholders can work more collaboratively to realize this goal in the normal course of addressing their specific accountabilities. It is the committee's hope that the disaster professional community and the health professional community both will see this report as relevant to their work and, in the process, be drawn more closely together. In this report, the committee endorses a comprehensive definition of a healthy community proposed by the National Network of Public Health Institutes: A healthy community is one in which a diverse group of stakeholders collaborate to use their expertise and local knowledge to create a community that is socially and physically conducive to health. Community members are empowered and civically engaged, assuring that all local policies consider health. The community has the capacity to identify, address, and evaluate their own health concerns on an ongoing basis, using data to guide and benchmark efforts. As a result, a healthy community is safe, economically secure, and environmentally sound, as all residents have equal access to high quality educational and employment opportunities, transportation and housing options, prevention and healthcare services, and healthy food and physical activity opportunities. This vision was important to the committee's work in large measure because of its emphasis on holistic engagement and community-specific strategies. Testimony before the committee consistently emphasized that no \"one-size-fits-all\" strategy or menu of recommendations will work everywhere or fit every scenario. A consistent lesson learned, however, was the importance of pre-disaster planning that proactively links disaster and health leadership at the community level and that benefits from the accumulated wisdom gleaned from other experiences. The committee appreciates the thoughtful vision of the study sponsors: the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD); the Veterans Health Administration at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA); and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. They all recognized the need for recommendations and guidance that would be useful to local and national leaders who were sensitized to the need to mitigate disaster-related health impacts and optimize the use of rebuilding resources to pursue the goal of creating communities that are healthier and more resilient in a more proactive, deliberate, and thoughtful manner. The committee's work benefited greatly from the exceptional Institute of Medicine staff team, led by study director Autumn Downey and including Bruce Altevogt, Elizabeth Cornett, Jack Herrmann, Rachel Kirkland, Crysti Park, Megan Reeve, and Lauren Shern. We are also indebted to the consultants who contributed substantially to this project. Steven Bingler, Melissa Brymer, and Gavin Smith lent the committee their invaluable expertise, and the report could not have been produced without the technical writing and editing contributions of Rona Briere, Miriam Davis, and Erin Hammers Forstag. Finally, I wish to offer thanks and acknowledgment to my fellow committee members, all of whom gave generously of their time in the undertaking of this important and challenging task. After 18 months of careful examination of testimony from a wide array of officials and experts, case studies, and the available literature, three compelling impressions remain with the committee members. First are the heartbreaking stories of misery and suffering experienced by so many people who live with or die prematurely from preventable illnesses and the many others who become sickened or injured as a result of experiencing a disaster event. We want better for them. Second is the gratitude that cannot be expressed often enough to the nation's disaster planning and response officials, workers, and volunteers, most of whom labor in anonymity and often are taken for granted. The nation needs more of them, and they deserve more from all Americans. Third, because no community is immune to a devastating event and because no community is maximally healthy, every reader of this report is urged to use this opportunity to contribute immediately to a process of collaborative planning that brings all stakeholders and community residents together to envision a healthy community, assess and prioritize key deficiencies, and then engage the resources and expertise of the disaster community as a key component of the collective effort to achieve an environment in which all people have the opportunity to live maximally healthy lives. It is the committee's hope that the observations and recommendations offered in this report will serve as a call to action and a useful guide for transformative action. Reed V.

Glossary |Community health assessment | ________________ [1](/read/18996/chapter/1#frontmatter6_fm6_ft1)Community health assessment is also sometimes referred to as a community health needs assessment. |Health impact assessment||A systematic process that uses an array of data sources and analytic methods and considers input from stakeholders to determine the potential effects of a proposed policy, plan, program, or project on the health of a population and the distribution of those effects within the population. Health impact assessment provides recommendations on monitoring and managing those effects (NRC, 2011, p. 1).| |Health in All Policies||An approach to public policies across sectors that systematically takes into account the health implications of decisions, seeks synergies, and avoids harmful health impacts, in order to improve population health and health equity (WHO, 2013).| |Healthy community||One in which a diverse group of stakeholders collaborate to use their expertise and local knowledge to create a community that is socially and physically conducive to health. Community members are empowered and civically engaged, assuring that all local policies consider health. The community has the capacity to identify, address, and evaluate their own health concerns on an ongoing basis, using data to guide and benchmark efforts. As a result, a healthy community is safe, economically secure, and environmentally sound, as all residents have equal access to high quality educational and employment opportunities, transportation and housing options, prevention and health care services, and healthy food and physical activity opportunities (HRIA, 2013).| |Population health||The health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group (Kindig and Stoddart, 2003).| |Resilience||The ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events (NRC, 2012, p. 1).| |Social determinants of health||The conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels (WHO, 2014).| |Sustainability||The ability of communities to consistently thrive over time as they make decisions to improve the community today without sacrificing the future (McGalliard, 2012).| REFERENCES FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency). 2007.
