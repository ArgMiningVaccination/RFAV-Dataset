Mentoring is not counselling or coaching. Your personal Mentor will guide you through a systematic structured programme to help you discover your true potential to be well, happy, fulfilled and purposeful. At Koru Clinic we believe true healing can occur when we can empower people to help them understand what the mental and emotional aspects of their condition are, these are also the ongoing triggers to their stress response. A prolonged stress in a persons mind and body is the major underlying cause of most disease and inflammation in the body. We use the Enhances Awareness Program (EAP) and The Six Step protocol from \"Choose Again\" based on A Course In Miracles. These programmes are designed to help you bring about changes you want to see in your life and have them be sustainable. By becoming aware of what is causing your fears, exhaustion, stress, ill health and learning how to transform your thinking; you will be able to live life with more happiness, health, clarity, peace and purpose. We will use our knowledge and experience as mentors as well as health professionals with multiple healing methods, to support you in integrating your healing journey mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually. Do you need some support right now? Make a start with our workbook or get in touch with us for an introductory session. The Enhances Awareness Programme The Enhances Awareness Programme is a structured system to help you see the blocks in your life, mentally, emotionally and physically. It has you bring your unconscious patterns of living into view. In doing so allows you to make new more conscious choices about how you want to live your life. You will discover the Core limiting belief you have about yourself, named in EAP as your story or narrative. It is now very well accepted that we all develop a belief about who we are and how we should function in life by the age of seven or eight years of age. This false belief is carried into adulthood and is at the root of how we react to life. Living from this childhood belief system limits our potential as well as causing ongoing stress responses, which we know can affect our health. A prolonged stress response has been linked to causing most inflammatory and degenerative conditions including cancer as well as depression, anxiety and burnout. Knowing what your core limiting belief is, allows you to become the observer of your reactions. You are then able to make more conscious choices in your responses rather than feeling powerless, confused or out of control. This is a powerful way to break the cycle of stress and inflammation in your body. You will also learn to identify when we are in reaction to our limiting beliefs and how to let them go so they don't perpetuate. You will learn how to do this in your own life when ever you find yourself in a stressful reaction. This is life-changing and powerfully healing.

With over 25 years of experience they have put together a programme with what they feel are the best methods available at this time. Is the programme suitable for you? This program is designed for anyone, who wants to improve the quality of their life. However, most people are usually motivated to participate as they can relate to one or more of these situations: 1. Compromised health and wellbeing. Chronic conditions which cause pain and ill health are often caused by a prolonged stress response. In order to help the body to heal, we need to understand where our stress response comes from and to be empowered to manage our reactions. The body is a manifestation of consciousness! 2. You are committed to ongoing personal growth and are looking for something new and innovative 3. You have done a lot of self-development or spiritual work but still struggle to maintain the changes or inner-peace 4. You have come to a cross-road in your life and are uncertain about how to move forward 5. You are experiencing a general feeling of discontent or wanting more out of life or more specifically: unhappiness in relationships lack of fulfilment in your career low self-esteem and confidence lack of direction or an absence of purpose The course not only makes a profound difference to the participant in the program, but also the lives of those you are in relationship with. Benefits Through the guidance of this structured awareness program and your personal mentor, you are providing yourself with an opportunity to become more aware of your values and more conscious of how you think, act and feel. You will identify your story and gain the ability to observe how it plays out in your life and make more self-loving choices as opposed to being limited by your habitual ways of operating and reacting. Our clients also consistently report the following benefits from participating in the program: A more consistent state of happiness. Feeling more engaged and fulfilled in life. More freedom to express their authentic self. Improved health and increased abundance. Less exhausted, allowing them to be focused and productive, creating what is important to them. More clarity of purpose and how to express it in their life How the Program works Each person works one-on-one with a Mentor to guide them through the step-by-step, easy-to-follow process. The EAP awareness unit takes 12 weeks to complete. Your programme will be adjusted to your specific needs and goals. Each week you will attend a 1 hour session with your mentor either in person or via Skype or phone call. At the end of each session your mentor will inform you of the activity that will need to be completed before you get together for your next session. "}
