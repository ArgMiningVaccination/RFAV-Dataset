With the global aging continues to accelerate, the incidence of AD is also increasing year by year. The chronic, persistent, and irreversible decline of learning and memory ability of AD brings serious harm and economic burden to families and society. Because of its complex of pathogenesis, there is still a lack of effective treatment for AD. Acupuncture, as one of the complementary and alternative therapies, has provided a promising avenue for the treatment of AD. This study comprehensively reviews literature from the last ten years, showing that acupuncture indeed exerts strong bene\u0000cial effects on AD. Acupuncture can regulate the species and structure of the intestinal \u0000ora, repair the intestinal barrier and the brain blood barrier, prevent in\u0000ammatory cytokines and harmful substances in the intestine from entering the blood and brain to improve the cognitive impairment of AD. In addition to this, acupuncture can treat AD by regulating A deposition (including inhibiting A production and promoting A clearance), inhibiting tau protein phosphorylation, improving the structure and function of neurons and synapses, promoting nerve regeneration, relieving chronic neuroin\u0000ammation, regulating energy metabolism and cerebral blood \u0000ow of the brain, etc. It is worth noting that the effect of acupuncture on AD is related to the selections of acupoints, the form and frequency of acupuncture, etc. Some special acupuncture methods, such as Sanjiao acupuncture and \"olfactory three-needle\" therapy, also provide new perspectives for AD. The therapeutic effect and potential mechanism of acupuncture on AD summarized in this study provide scienti\u0000c and reliable evidence for acupuncture application for AD. Introduction Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory loss, cognitive impairment, behavioral abnormalities, and decreased living ability, including problems with language, disorientation (easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, self- neglect, and behavioral issues [1]. With the high incidence among people over the age of 65 and the global aging population, more than 152 million people are expected to be affected by 2050 [2]. During the last decade, the number of deaths from AD has increased 71% and AD has become the fourth leading cause of death worldwide [3]. Because the aging population continues to accelerate, AD has become a major burden worldwide. In this regard, researchers never stop to \u0000nd the effective drug therapies to halt or reverse the process of AD. However, more than 95% of drugs have failed in clinical trials [4]. Thus, the identi\u0000cation of effective and safe treatments with clear functional mechanisms is urgently needed. Complementary and alternative therapies such as acupuncture has provided a promising avenue for the treatment of AD. Acupuncture is a procedure of inserting a stainless-steel needle into acupoints to achieve therapeutic effects. The effect can be further enhanced by lifting or twisting the needle, electrical stimulation, or combined with medication. Both clinical and experimental researches have con\u0000rmed the e\u0000cacy of acupuncture on AD [5, 6]. Moreover, some recent studies reported that acupuncture is superior to or comparable to the drug therapies, such as the donepezil treatment [7, 8] and probiotics [9]. The aim of this study was to uncover the mechanisms of acupuncture for AD. Materials and Methods Search Strategy We screened PubMed, Web of science and Embase database for published studies from January 2012 to January 2022 (the past ten years). The keywords employed were as follows: [\"acupuncture\" or \"electroacupuncture\" or \"transcutaneous or \"Alzheimer symptom\"]. The language was limited to English. The website's search engine was used to perform the initial \u0000ltering, and after removing 437 duplicate articles, we got 989 relevant articles eventually. Study Selection We employed Excel software to select articles that meet the theme manually. Among them, 40 articles are lack of abstract or full text, 719 articles are irrelevant to the theme, 48 articles are clinical researches, and 99 articles are reviews or meta-analyses. So, these articles were excluded. Finally, 83 articles were included. A \u0000ow chart is depicted in Fig. 1. Data extraction We extracted key data from these studies as follows, the type of models, interventions (acupoints, acupuncture methods and parameters), and outcome measurements (behavioral index and biochemical index). All data were extracted and checked by two people. Results Effect of Acupuncture on Pathological Process of AD in Brain A deposition At present, it is generally believed that amyloid- protein (A ) is the \"trigger\" of AD. A is a polypeptide containing 39~43 amino acid residues. Among them, A 1-40 and A 1-42 are the two most common subtypes that have high aggregation capacity. When AD occurs, the production and clearancePage 3/28process of A has become disordered. A can further aggregate to form large insoluble A \u0000bers and store in the brain as amyloid plaques [10]. Acupuncture can prevent and treat AD by inhibiting A production and promoting A elimination in the brain. A can be generated after the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and -secretase enzyme complex [11]. In the amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing, APP is initially cleaved by BACE1, resulting in soluble APP (sAPP ) Benshen (GB13) can reduce APP and CTFs of APP to improve learning and memory in 5\u00d7FAD mice [13]. EA at Baihui (GV20) and Shenshu (BL23) can reduce the expression of APP and BACE1, thus inhibiting A production to improve the learning, memory and spatial exploration abilities of amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) double transgenic mice [14]. in hippocampus, further decrease A 1-42 expression to improve the cognitive impairment in SAMP8 mice [15]. BACE1 can affect the physiological function of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA, known as cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinase A, can enhance the activity of proteasome and promote hydrolysis of tau to improve the effectiveness of hippocampal memory [16]. Researches show that and activate PKA, and decrease A production in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, therefore changing memory and learning ability of AD [17, 18]. After the APP decomposition by BACE1, the function of -secretase begins to play. APP-CTFs are subsequently cleaved by -secretase to release A and the APP intracellular domain (AICD) [12]. -secretase has been an attractive target for the treatment of AD. However, the research on -secretase regulation by acupuncture is few and needs to be further studied. Moreover, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) abnormal activation is involved in AD, accompanied by A deposition and its induced neuronal apoptosis in the brain. EA at GV20, GV29 and GV26 can decrease the deposition of APP in APP/PS1 mice, partially by reducing the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MKK4), MKK7, c-Jun and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [19] (Fig. 2). The clearance of A in the brain basically depends on three common mechanisms: degradation by degrading enzymes, endocytosis, and the brain blood barrier (BBB) transport [20]. Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) is a key enzyme, not only for insulin metabolism, but also for A degradation. When the brain is in the state of insulin de\u0000ciency or insulin resistance, it would lead to A deposition [21]. EA at GV20 and BL23 can enhance IDE expression in hippocampus, thus promoting A degradation [14, 22]. This be internalized and degraded by microglia, astrocytes, and other cells through endocytosis. In the endocytosis proteins, (LPL), and apolipoprotein quite essential. It was found that EA at GV20 and BL23 can enhance 2M, TTR, LPL and APoE expression, thus promoting A 1-42 degradation to delay the progress of AD [22]. The active transport of BBB is another effective way to clear A . During this process, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) can mediate transport of A from the brain to the peripheral blood circulation through the BBB. In reverse, A can enter the brain from the peripheral circulation through the damaged BBB. The transport balance between them affects the level of A in the brain. EA at GV20 and Yongquan (KI1) can upregulate hippocampal LRP1 and downregulate A to improve learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice [24]. In addition to these three common scavenging mechanisms, the latest research found that the whole cerebral paravascular pathway mediated by astrocytes, also known as the \"glymphatic system\", might also help to eliminate A . The glymphatic system allows cerebrospinal \u0000uid (CSF) to enter the brain through the periarterial space and enter the stroma through aquaporin-4 (AQP4) located in the end feet of perivascular astrocytes. It can also drive the perivenous drainage of interstitial \u0000uid (ISF) and its solutes, thereby brain [25]. EA at GV20, GV29 and GV26 can improve the clearance function of glymphatic system and accelerate the exchange process of CSF-ISF to reduce A deposition in SAMP8 mice [26]. Besides, increasing evidence have proved the roles of macroautophagy/autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) in AD. Its impairment would lead to A aggregation, thus making transcription factor EB (TFEB), which orchestrates ALP, as a promising target for treating AD. EA activated TFEB via inhibiting the AKT- MAPK1- mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1 (MTORC1) pathway, thus promoting ALP in the brain [13]. The above researches showed that EA ameliorate the learning and memory ability of AD mainly by inhibiting A production and promote A clearance. EA at GV20, GV26, GV29, BL23, GV14, GV24 and GB13 can inhibit A production in the brain by reducing the generation of APP, CTFs and BACE1, and these processes were related to PKA of A by upregulating the A -degrading enzyme (such as IDE) and the endocytosis related proteins, active the transport of BBB, promote the exchange process of CSF-ISF, GV26, GV29, BL23, GV24 and GB13 not only play roles in inhibiting A production, but also in promoting A clearance. The regulatory effects of acupuncture on -secretase might be a new target for AD, which needs future research (Figure.3). Tau phosphorylation Contrary to the extracellular A , another important pathological indication of AD is the neuro\u0000brillary tangles (NFTs), which are formed by the intracellular tau protein. The mainstream view holds that the deposition of A accelerates the AD process and \"triggers\" harmful cascade reactions including tau pathology and neurodegeneration. But now, more and more evidence showed that A and tau have synergistic effects [27]. Tau protein is a microtubule-associated protein. Its main function is to maintain the stability of axonal microtubules to ensure the normal function of the brain. When tau protein is hyperphosphorylated, its ability to bind to microtubules is decreased. The hyperphosphorylated tau assembles to form NFTs, which are directly related to the degree of AD [28]. Researchers have found that acupuncture can reduce the level of phosphorylated tau to alleviate cognitive impairment. EA at GV24 p-tau (s404) in hippocampus, improving the cognitive function of AD induced by galactose (D-gal) that participates in the induction of tau phosphorylation. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) the GSK-3 . and BL23 can GSK- 3 /mTOR pathway, further reduce tau phosphorylation and alleviate memory impairment in D-gal induced AD rats [30, 31]. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) could promote protein folding, help degrade misfolded proteins and prevent the aggregation of denatured proteins. It was found that Hsps were involvedPage 4/28in the regulation of tau of Hsp70, Hsp84, Hsp86 and Hsp90, thus improving the cognitive function of AD [32, 33]. In conclusion, the effect of acupuncture on inhibiting tau hyperphosphorylation can be achieved by downregulating GSK3 GV24 and GB13 were involved in this process. In addition, Sanjiao acupuncture, which is composed of CV17, CV12, CV6, SP10 and ST36, also plays a vital role in this progress (Fig. 4). Neuron loss and degeneration Neuron loss is the main cause and the \u0000nal event of irreversible progression of AD. Studies have found that acupuncture can regulate the number, structure and function of neurons to improve AD symptoms. Sanjiao acupuncture can increase the number of neurons in hippocampal CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) of SAMP8 mice[34, 35]. It is also veri\u0000ed that EA GV20 can increase the number of neurons in APP/PS1 transgenic mice [36]. A can lead to neuron apoptosis and death by breaking the neuron calcium balance. Reducing or inhibiting the hippocampal neuron apoptosis is one of the key strategies to restore learning and memory function of AD. Notch signaling pathway, which is a highly conserved signal transduction pathway and regulate the transcription of Notch target genes (such as Hes), participates in the process of neuron apoptosis [37]. EA at GV20 and BL23 can downregulate Notch1 and Hes1, thus decreasing the number of apoptotic neurons induced by A in hippocampus [38]. Besides the decrease in the number of neurons, the morphology and structure of neurons were also signi\u0000cantly damaged in AD, such as obvious swelling of neuronal cytoplasm, which is manifested by loose, empty, and bright cytoplasm. And this might be related to aberrant Wnt signaling. EA at GV20 and BL23 can Wnt signaling via alterations in axin and -catenin in the hippocampus to improve the neuronal edema by injection [39]. at GV20 and GV24 could increase the number and the functional connectivity of neurons between the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus [40]. In the nervous system, synapse help to transmit neural signals from one neuron to another, and this is crucial to connections between neurons. It is reported that AD can be viewed as a synaptic failure in structure and function [41]. EA at GV20 and BL23 can repair the damage of synaptic ultrastructure by increasing the synaptic curvatures, decreasing the width of synaptic clefts and thickening postsynaptic density to improve the learning and memory de\u0000cits induced effects on synaptic morphology in AD rats [43]. In addition to altering synaptic structure by acupuncture, EA at GV20, GV14, BL23 could improve synaptic function, which might be related to the inhibition of AMPK/eEF2K/eEF2 pathway in the and SYN1 are presynaptic proteins that can regulate the release of neurotransmitters and the e\u0000ciency of synaptic vesicle circulation. PSD95 is the postsynaptic protein, which is involved in postsynaptic signal transduction and integration. EA at GV20 and BL23 or Sanjiao acupuncture can increase the expression of SYP, SYN1 and PSD95, preventing and alleviating memory de\u0000cits in [30, PSD95 to reduce ultrastructural thus working memory and synaptic plasticity of 5\u00d7FAD mice [47]. In addition to the regulation of neurons and synapse, acupuncture also regulates the secretion of neurotransmitters and neurotrophins. Neurotransmitters are the chemical substance that help to transmit information between neurons or between neurons and effectors. EA at GV20 can upregulate the metabolism of excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (Glu) to improve learning and memory in APP/PS1 transgenic mice [36]. EA at GV20 and ST36 can acid receptor (NMDAR) subunits GluN1, GluN2A, neuropeptide Orexin A (OxA) and activation of cAMP/PKA/CREB signal pathway, further enhance synaptic transmission and improve the cognitive function of SAMP8 mice [48]. Up to now, researchers have found 8 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu1-8), all of which belong to class C G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. G proteins are signal transduction proteins that can bind to guanosine diphosphate and have GTP hydrolase activity. The transmembrane and intracellular signal transduction of G proteins are involved in the pathological changes of AD. The cognitive function is closely related to G S and G i protein, which can be activated by G protein signal transduction. It is found that sanjiao acupuncture can upregulate the cortical physiologically coupled activation rate (PCAR) and the hippocampal maximal coupled activation rate (MCAR) of G S and G i in order to improve the acquisition, consolidation and maintenance of spatial learning and memory in SAMP8 mice[49]. Moreover, EA at ST36 and SP6 can inhibitory neurotransmitter -aminobutyric acid (GABA) in hippocampus [50]. while at GV20 and BL23 can not only enhance LTP, but also enhance long-term depression (LTD) [51]. LTP and LTD are important factors that affect neuronal synaptic plasticity and some learning and memory activities. It is often believed that LTP is related to memory formation and storage, and LTD is related to memory integration and forgetfulness. EA enhances the information transmission between neurons by upregulating LTP and LTD, thus improving the learning and memory ability of AD rats [51]. Acupuncture can also regulate the cholinergic system. (AChE), signi\u0000cantly improving spatial recognition memory and pattern separation impairment of 5\u00d7FAD mice [52]. According to the chemical composition, neurotransmitters are divided into choline (acetylcholine), monoamine (norepinephrine, dopamine and neuropeptides. The above studies have con\u0000rmed that acupuncture play signi\u0000cant roles in AD by regulating choline, amino acid, and neuropeptide. Beyond that, recent studies have shown that monoaminergic system has extensive projection in brain stem and participates in many central nervous activities. When its function is abnormal, it would lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, especially in serotonergic noradrenergic locus coeruleus, and dopaminergic investigated the effects ofPage 5/28acupuncture on monoamine neurotransmitters in AD, which might be a new target and need further research using methods such as neurotropic virus- mediated neural circuit tracing technology and chemogenetic techniques. Besides neurotransmitters, neurotrophins are also very important in the treatment of AD, namely brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF can help the growth of newborn neurons to improve the function of the brain. BDNF exerts its biological effects via binding to the tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) or BDNF expression in DG of hippocampus, which might be related to the BDNF/TrkB/p75NTR signal pathway, to improve learning and memory de\u0000cits in telomerase-de\u0000cient (Terc/) induced AD mice [54]. Likewise, it has also been veri\u0000ed by EA at GV20 in APP/PS1 transgenic mice [36, 55, 56]. Moreover, recent studies found that estrogen also have roles in preventing AD, and the mechanism might be related to the effects of estrogen on central BDNF and neurotransmitter. EA at Guanyuan SP6 of estradiol (E2) in the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary (HPO) axis to improve spatial learning and memory of female SAMP8 mice [57]. Recently, the regulatory effect of acupuncture on nerve regeneration also received some attention. Neural stem cells (NSCs), which have the potential for nerve regeneration, are the promising clinical strategy for AD. Transplantation with NSCs can improve cognitive dysfunction. However, only a few transplanted NSCs can survive, proliferate and differentiate into functional neurons under the in\u0000uence of the host microenvironment, which leads to a decline in therapeutic effects. Sanjiao acupuncture can upregulate the level of BDNF, bFGF and EGF, all of which are key factors to NSCs survival, and thus improving the cognitive ability of SAMP8 mice [58, 59]. The above researches the number and repair the damaged structures and functions of neurons and synapses, playing signi\u0000cant roles in treating AD. And these might be related to inhibitions of Notch and AMPK/eEF2K/eEF2 signaling, and activations of Wnt and PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 BL23, GV24, SP6, CV4 and Sanjiao acupuncture can also enhance the transmission of information by regulating choline, amino acid, and neuropeptide, and promote the nerve regeneration by neurotrophins. Acupuncture also plays vital roles in increasing the survival rate of transplanted NSCs and promoting nerve regeneration, but the speci\u0000c mechanism needs further research (Fig. 5). Neuroin\u0000ammation Neuroin\u0000ammation, which occurs near amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau, has been proved to be one of key pathological features of AD. AD related neuritis would affect synaptic communication and synaptic apoptosis, leading to the initial cognitive decline of AD [60, 61]. Microglia and astrocytes are the main cells in response to in\u0000ammation in the central nervous system (CNS). It has been found that acupuncture can inhibit neuroin\u0000ammation by promoting the polarization of glial cells from in\u0000ammatory to anti-in\u0000ammatory phenotype, inhibiting the activation of in\u0000ammatory pathways and the release of in\u0000ammatory cytokines to relieve AD symptoms. Microglia, accounting for about 10% of the CNS, are resident macrophages. Microglia play vital roles in neuronal plasticity and regeneration. They could phagocytize toxic products, acting as the \u0000rst line of defense for the central immune system [62]. It has been found that triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), both of which are on the cytomembrane of microglia, can be activated by A , thus triggering the downstream signal. In the early stage of AD, microglia can recognize amyloid plaques after being activated, and quickly gather around them to form a physical barrier, thus preventing the further diffusion of neurotoxic \u0000brils around the plaques. Microglia can also help to phagocytize the deposition of amyloid plaque to slow down the progress of AD [63]. EA at GV20 and GV29 can upregulate the downregulating 5- methylcytosine and upregulating 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in hippocampus, thus promoting the activation of microglia to phagocytize A [64]. However, the sustained activation of microglia would lead to neuroin\u0000ammation. EA at GV20, GV26 and GV29 can inhibit microglial activation through reducing the expression of TLR4 and its downstream myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF- B) in hippocampus, thus alleviating the neuroin\u0000ammation in AD rats [65]. EA at GV20 can not only inhibit TLR4 downstream NF- B, but also activate IL- 4/Stat6 pathway, of anti-in\u0000ammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL- 10). Through promoting the polarization of microglia from M1 pro-in\u0000ammatory to M2 anti-in\u0000ammatory phenotype, EA at GV20 improve the memory and learning ability of A 142 induced AD rats [66]. Likewise, EA at GV20 and GV24 can also help to promote the polarization of microglia from M1 to M2 type with improvement of learning and memory in mild and moderate APP/PS1 mice [67]. PI3K is often considered to be the upstream of the NF- B pathway. Sanjiao acupuncture can protect the cognitive impairment and alleviate the in\u0000ammation and nuclear damage of SAMP8 mice by reducing the PI3K/PDK1/nPKC/Rac1 pathway [68]. Recently, it was found that olfactory recognition disorder was already existed in the early stage of AD. The entorhinal cortex can receive direct sensory input from the sense of smell, and then transmit information to the hippocampus. The \"olfactory three- needle\" therapy (GV29 and LI20) the of microglia by inhibiting p38MAPK phosphorylation in the hippocampus to relieve in\u0000ammation and neurotoxicity, thus improving the spatial learning and memory ability of SAMP8 mice [69]. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR- ) is the negative regulator of p38MAPK, which is a typical ligand activated nuclear receptor. EA at GV20 and BL23 suppresses the aberrant glial increasing PPAR- and decreasing the p38MAPK phosphorylation to alleviate neuroin\u0000ammatory reaction in hippocampal CA1 A 1-40 induced AD rats [70]. NLRP in\u0000ammatory body family also play key roles in in\u0000ammatory responses of microglia in AD, which is composed of the nucleotide binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein (NLRP) and the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD domain (ASC) protein. NLRP3 and NLRP1 can activate procasapase-1 through its pyrin domain and can also promote the recruitment of procasapase-1 through ASC protein [71]. MA or at GV20 GV24 can inhibit the NLRP3/Caspase-1 pathway in the hippocampus to improve the learning and memory ability of AD mice [72-74]. In addition to this, transauricular vagal nerve stimulation (taVNS) can also inhibit the purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R)/NLRP3/Caspase-1 pathway in hippocampus to improve spatial learning and memory of APP/PS1 mice [75]. Besides NLRP3, MA BL17 can inhibit NLRP1 in\u0000ammasome activation to improve the learning and memory impairment of SAMP8 mice [76].Page 6/28Astrocytes are large gliacytes with multiple functions and play active roles in neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, neurotransmission, and the formation and maintenance of BBB. Astrocyte hyperplasia has been found in the postmortem brain tissue of AD patients, and there is a correlation between the degree of this change and cognitive impairment. In the presence of amyloid plaque, the C-terminal 100 amino acid of beta APP in plaques of senile age induces astrocyte hyperplasia and neuronal death[60]. It was and in prefrontal cortical and hippocampus to reduce neuroin\u0000ammatory response and improve in 5\u00d7FAD mice [77]. EA at GV20, BL23, KI3 can simultaneously reduce the activation of astrocytes and reduce the in\u0000ammatory factor (TNF- , IL-17) de\u0000cits SAMP8 mice [78]. N-myc downstream regulator gene 2 (NDRG2) is expressed on astrocytes of different brain regions (cerebral cortex, hippocampus and olfactory bulb). And it was revealed that NDRG2 upregulation in the hippocampus was accompanied by astrocytosis and reference memory impairment. In the APP/PS1 double transgenic mice, EA at GV20 can inhibit the upregulation of NDRG2 and the activation of astrocytes, thereby reducing in\u0000ammatory responses and alleviating the reference memory de\u0000cits [79]. Astrocytes and microglia both belong to monocyte/macrophage lineage and can be activated by A . They interact with neurons, immune cells, etc., acting as an important defense of the nervous system. But obviously, there is much less study on the mechanism of astrocytes in the treatment of AD by acupuncture than microglia. The traditional view holds that microglia are always activated earlier under the pathological state. After being activated, microglia send signals to astrocytes [80]. This might be one of the reasons for more researches on microglia. With the exploration of astrocytes in AD, the roles of acupuncture in regulating astrocytes would be further explored. The above evidence con\u0000rmed that in the early stage of AD, acupuncture can promote the activation of microglia to phagocytize A . With the progression of AD, acupuncture help to promote the polarization of microglia from M1 pro-in\u0000ammatory type to M2 anti-in\u0000ammatory type by cytokines. can also inhibit activation of astrocytes to neuroin\u0000ammation. Among these processes, GV20, auricular concha, KI3 and BL17 also could be used (Fig. 6). Brain energy metabolism Brain energy metabolism disorder is closely related to the pathogenesis of AD, mainly including abnormal glucose uptake and mitochondrial dysfunction. Studies have found that acupuncture can regulate brain glucose metabolism and improve mitochondrial dysfunction to relieve symptoms of AD. Glucose is the important source of energy in neural activity, and the metabolic rate of glucose can re\u0000ect the brain function. Acupuncture at a single acupoint, namely ST36, can improve the glucose metabolism of multiple brain regions, such as the bilateral limbic system (pyriform cortex), the bilateral temporal lobe 82]. Similarly, MA at Shenmen (HT7) can also improve the glucose metabolism activity of hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and frontal/temporal lobe in the D-gal induced AD model [83]. Not only MA, but also EA at GV20 can signi\u0000cantly increase the glucose metabolism in speci\u0000c brain areas such [84]. When multiple acupoints are chosen, such as MA at GV24 and GB13, can also improve glucose metabolism [85]. EA at GV20, GV26 and can increase the uptake rate of glucose in hippocampus and frontal lobe of SAMP8 or APP/PS1 double transgenic mice, improving spatial learning and memory [8, 86-88]. Moreover, it is proved that not only EA, but also MA at these three acupoints can increase the level of glucose metabolism in the whole brain [89]. These evidences suggested that acupuncture has the targeted regulatory effects on multiple brain regions. Studies have found that metabolic homeostasis are crucial to glucose metabolism, and in this process adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) and AKT serine/threonine kinase are critical. When the energy level was low, it would be activated by phosphorylation [90]. EA at GV14 and BL23 can of p-AMPK in hippocampal CA1 region, ameliorate learning and memory impairment in SAMP8 mice [91]. It was proved that EA at GV20 and GV24 can activate AMPK pathway to enhance glucose metabolism and increase the expression of aerobic glycolysis (AG) related proteins in hippocampus, including hexokinase II phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), thus improving learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice [92]. Besides p-AMPK, EA at GV20 can also induce the phosphorylation of AKT and further trigger GLUT1 and GLUT3 to increase the glucose metabolism [84]. EA at GV20, GV26 and (Ser473) and GSK-3 (Ser9) phosphorylation to enhance the glucose metabolism, thus improving the cognitive ability of APP/PS1 mice [93]. Triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) is also one of the key enzymes in the glucose metabolism. When TPI is de\u0000cient, it would lead to the accumulation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), thus inhibiting the glycolysis process and causing abnormal glucose metabolism [94]. Sanjiao acupuncture can signi\u0000cantly increase TPI activity and inhibit DHAP accumulation in hippocampus of SAMP8 mice, thus well regulating the glycolysis process and restoring the function of brain metabolism [95]. Researches show that mitochondrial damage and dysfunction are the early pathological changes of AD and precede the development of A and tau pathology [96]. MA at GV20, SP10, the hippocampal mitochondrial proteome expression to regulate the structure and function of hippocampus mitochondria in SAMP8 mice, therefore realizing the potential therapeutic effect on AD [97]. Studies have con\u0000rmed that the accumulation of oligomeric A in neurons can cause increased mitochondrial \u0000ssion and reduced fusion, thus ultimately leads to neurodegeneration [98]. Fission protein 1 (Fis1) and mitochondrial protein 2 (Mfn2) are closely associated with mitochondrial \u0000ssion and fusion, respectively. It was proved that both can be regulated by acupuncture. EA at GV20, GV24 and GB13 can reduce the expression of Fis1 and increase Mfn2 to reduce mitochondrial damage. Moreover, the main method to eliminate mitochondrial damage is mitophagy. EA at GV20, GV24 upregulate the mitophagy proteins Beclin 1 and LC3B-II by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby reducing the learning and memory disorders of AD [99, 100]. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a class SIRT1 and PGC-1 can promote the survival of neurons in AD patients [101]. It is found that EA at GV14 and BL23 can increase SIRT1 and increase the activity of hippocampal mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, II, III, IV and ATP concentration, thus improving the mitochondrial function of SAMP8 mice [103]. Impaired mitochondrial function could not only lead to energy de\u0000ciency, but also increase the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress, which leads to A deposition and tau phosphorylation [96]. Hyperoxidative damage caused by free radicals was also one of the main pathological mechanisms of AD. The deposition of A and the interweaving of nerves further lead to the increase of ROS and the production of oxidation products such as malondialdehyde (MDA), and the induction of high oxidative damage and neuron apoptosis. ROS can be produced within multiple cells and be regulated by a variety of enzymes, such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase NOX2-related oxidative stress in hippocampus of AD rats induced by A 1-42, restore total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), reduce ROS and MDA to improve spatial learning and memory impairment in AD rats [104]. Conversely, superoxide antioxidant metalloenzymes to remove free radicals and help to avoid excessive oxidative damage [105]. EA at ST36 and GV14 can raise the SOD and lower the MDA level to improve the streptozotocin (STZ) induced AD rats' learning and memory ability. While the effect of EA combined with medicine is better than that of EA alone [106]. EA at LI 20 and GV29 (\"olfactory therapy) can also improve SOD and GSH-Px, reduce MDA content in hippocampus, thereby improving learning and memory ability of AD rats [107]. To sum up, acupuncture regulates brain energy metabolism mainly by regulating glucose metabolism (by Acupuncture can improve glucose metabolism in multiple brain regions of AD models, and the multi-target effects of acupuncture might be related to AMPK/AKT/GSK3 and TPI/DHAP pathway. In addition, acupuncture can regulate the structure and function of mitochondria through decrease of Fis1, increase of Mfn2, mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, II, III, IV and ATP, and activation of SIRT1/PGC-1 pathway. Acupuncture can also help to remove the damaged mitochondria by PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, alleviating peroxidation damage caused by free radicals is also one of the potential mechanisms of acupuncture in treating AD (Fig. 7). Cerebral blood \u0000ow The cerebral blood \u0000ow (CBF) is essential for brain function. CBF disorder is considered to be the \u0000rst step in the development of AD. CBF has been decreased before clinical symptoms appear, suggesting that it has the potential inducing effects on the pathological changes of AD, including the expression of APP and tau phosphorylation [108]. Ischemia and hypoxia caused by the reduction of CBF can directly induce neuronal injury and synaptic dysfunction, and then start the neurodegenerative process [109]. CBF is de\u0000ned as CBF velocity \u00d7 cross-sectional area, so CBF is related to blood \u0000ow velocity and vasodilation. Acupuncture can increase CBF by regulating the vasodilation and contraction to improve memory ability. MA at GV20 and GV29 can effectively improve the CBF of hippocampus and prefrontal lobe, improving the spatial learning, relearning, and memory abilities of SAMP8 mice [110]. As AD progresses, the damage would spread to different brain regions. Besides hippocampus and prefrontal lobe, MA at ST36 can also increase blood perfusion in the bilateral limbic system (pyriform cortex), the lobe (olfactory cortex) and the right amygdala [81]. Studies have shown that cerebral amyloid angiopathy caused by the deposition of A in the cerebral vascular wall not only destroys the cerebral vascular structure, but also weakens the neurovascular coupling. In this case, it is not feasible to enhance CBF through vasodilation. Therefore, early intervention and protection of brain microvascular structure and function is very important for delaying the pathological process of AD [111]. MA at GV20 and GV29 can negatively regulate the phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-arachidonic acid (AA) pathway and inhibit the expression of vasoactive agents such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). In this process, MA increases CBF through inhibiting the vasodilation and accelerating the blood \u0000ow speed, thus effectively improving the learning and memory ability of SAMP8 mice. Enhancing CBF through \"abnormal\" vasoconstriction rather than typical vasodilation is one of the reasons why MA is bene\u0000cial to CBF [112]. The above studies con\u0000rmed that acupuncture has the regulatory effects on CBF in multiple brain regions, and its mechanism may be related to PLA2-AA pathway. However, there is less research in this area at present, which needs to be further explored (Fig. 8). Effect of Acupuncture on AD via the Microbiota-gut-brain Axis The microbiota-gut-brain axis is considered as the bidirectional communication pathway between brain and gut, which can be connected by cytokines, hormones, and neurotransmitters [113]. In recent years, a growing number of researches indicated that the dysregulation of intestinal microbiota might be the trigger for AD. There are trillions of microbiotas in the gastrointestinal tract. The reasonable species and structure of intestinal microbiotas are bene\u0000cial to the health of the host, while the imbalance of intestinal microbiota will increase the susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases, like AD. Both clinical and experimental studies have found that the diversity and the structure of intestinal microbiotas in AD patients and animal models were generally decreased [114], which could be regulated by acupuncture. MA relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Porphyromonadaceae, Coriobacteriaceae, Helicobacteraceae, and ST36 can increase the Sobs index and the abundance of Bacteroidota, and decrease the abundance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Escherichia-Shigella [9]. EA at GV20 and balance the composition and number of intestinal microbiotas, higher in Delta- proteobacteria and Epsilon-proteobacteria [116].Page 8/28Intestinal \u0000ora imbalance and intestinal barrier destruction could cause chronic in\u0000ammation in the blood and brain of AD patients. Then intestinal microbiota and pro-in\u0000ammatory cytokines enter the blood circulation, and further enter the brain through the damaged BBB, thus causing central nervous neuroin\u0000ammation and neurodegeneration [117]. Acupuncture can decrease the expression of in\u0000ammatory cytokines in the blood and brain. Some studies have found that the content of in\u0000ammatory cytokines detected in the brain was closely related to that in the serum as AD progressed. EA at GV20 and to apoptosis of neurons in frontal cortex, lobe cortex in SAMP8 the levels of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in serum, and signi\u0000cantly improving the learning and memory abilities of APP/PS1 mice [115]. Acupuncture can decrease in\u0000ammatory cytokines and prevent them from entering the blood and brain by repairing the intestinal barrier and BBB to protect neurons and improve AD cognitive impairment. MA at GV20, GV29 and ST36 can effectively improve BBB dysfunction, evidenced by an increase in tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin) and lower permeability. The possible mechanism might be through the regulation of intestinal microbiota and the reduction of pro-in\u0000ammatory cytokines (LPS, TNF- brain tissues [9, 119]. The above researches elaborate from one certain angle of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. In 2021, a relatively complete study was published. It is indicated that EA pretreatment at GV20 and ST36 can restore the spatial learning and memory of D-gal induced aging rats by regulating the impaired microbiota-gut-brain axis. EA increased the relative DNA abundance of Lactobacillus and Bi\u0000dobacterium, and reduced that of E. coli and B. fragilis. In addition, EA restored the function of intestinal mucosa barrier and BBB, shown by upregulating epithelial tight junction protein ZO- 1. And EA reduced diamine oxidase (DAO) and LPS in serum and hippocampus, which was probably related to the inhibition of microglial TLR4/NF- B pathway [120]. Besides the immunomodulatory pathway, the gut and the brain can also communicate through nerves. The afferent branches of the vagus nerves are the main nerves connecting the gastrointestinal tract and the brain in mammals. LPS in the intestine can directly activate the TLR4 or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, such as 5-HT3, 5-HT4) receptors of the intestinal vagus nerves to affect the in\u0000ammation of the brain directly [121]. It is proved that vagotomy could block the central signal transduction of lactobacillus and bi\u0000dobacterium in mice, thus affecting brain[122]. Currently, there is little relevant research on acupuncture prevention of AD by regulating the vagus nerves. While it is well proved that acupuncture has the anti-in\u0000ammatory effect by regulating vagus nerves [123]. For example, EA at ST36 can enhance the activities of vagus nerves to promote the release of acetylcholine. Through acting on 7nAChRs of mesenteric white adipose tissues, EA inhibits the TNF- production [124]. Similarly, Nature Medicine reported that EA effectively prevents sepsis through the vagal dopaminergic anti-in\u0000ammatory pathway [125]. In 2020, Neuron also reported that low-intensity EA can drive the vagus-adrenal axis to exert the anti-in\u0000ammatory effects, and protect the intestinal barrier via neuropeptide Y (NPY) and adrenal chroma\u0000n cells [126]. These studies provided new ideas for neural mechanisms of acupuncture in treating AD in the future (Fig. 9). Discussion Effectiveness and mechanisms of acupuncture for AD Clinical studies have revealed that acupuncture has certain regulatory effects on AD. In the past, the mechanism of acupuncture for AD focused on local changes of the brain. In recent years, more and more studies have found that the imbalance of intestinal microbiota might be the initial cause of AD. Due to the destruction of intestinal barrier and BBB caused by the imbalance of intestinal \u0000ora, the microorganisms and pro-in\u0000ammatory cytokines enter the blood and brain, causing neuroin\u0000ammation and neurodegeneration, like AD. Studies in the past decade have shown that acupuncture can regulate the intestinal \u0000ora species and structure, repair the intestinal barrier and BBB, prevent in\u0000ammatory cytokines from entering the blood and brain, and \u0000nally alleviate AD cognitive impairment. The detailed process are as acupuncture can regulate the composition and quantity of intestinal microbiota. And in this process, MA seems to be more effective than EA. Acupuncture at GV20, GV29 and ST36 also helps to restore the functions of intestinal barrier and BBB, and reduce the in\u0000ammatory factors (LPS, TNF- , IL-1 ) in circulating blood and brain. In the brain lesion site, the pathogenic mechanism of AD is related to A deposition, tau phosphorylation, neuron loss and degeneration, neuroin\u0000ammation, brain energy metabolism and CBF, etc. Acupuncture GV26, GV29, BL23, through PKA, JNK MAPK pathway, related protein and LRP1 to promote the clearance of A . The latest research shows that the clearance of A can also be achieved through the lymphatic drainage of CSF and ISF. EA can upregulate AQP4, accelerate CSF-ISF exchange process, thus promoting A clearance. In contrast to extracellular A , intracellular tau protein is another important pathological indication. Sanjiao and other acupoints such as GV20, BL23, GV24, GB13 can inhibit tau hyperphosphorylation, which were proved to be related to the inhibition of GSK3 /mTOR pathway and increase of HSPs. Loss and degeneration of neurons could accelerate the development of AD. GV20, BL23, the number and repair the damaged structures and functions of neurons and synapses, which were related to the inhibition of Notch and AMPK/eEF2K/eEF2 signaling, and activation of Wnt and PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 pathway. CV4 synaptic connection by choline, amino acid, and neuropeptide, and promote the nerve regeneration by upregulating BDNF, which also needs further research. Frequently, neuroin\u0000ammation often occurs after neuron injury, and in this process microglia and astrocytes are mainly the polarization of microglia to anti-in\u0000ammatory phenotype and reduce pro- in\u0000ammatory cytokines. This was proved to be related to the regulation of TREM2, TLR4, IL-4Ra and PPAR- receptors on B, IL-4/Stat6, PI3K/PDK1/nPKC/Rac1, P2X7R/NLRP3/Caspase-1, NLRP1/Caspase-1 and p38MAPK pathway, etc. In addition, the regulation of acupuncture on neuroin\u0000ammation is also related to the inhibition of NDRG2 on astrocytes. The disorder of brain energy metabolism is also closely related to the pathogenesis of AD, which includes glucose can improve glucose metabolism in multiple brain regions, which may be related to AMPK/AKT/GSK3 orPage repair the mitochondrial structure and regulate the secondary dysfunction by SIRT1/PGC-1 pathway, and remove the damaged mitochondria by PI3K/Akt pathway. The decrease of CBF could occur at all stages of AD. Acupuncture at GV20, GV29 and ST36 can increase the CBF in multiple regions of the brain, which may be related to the PLA2-AA pathway. The regulatory effects of acupuncture on glucose metabolism and CBF in multiple brain areas suggest the \"multiple target\" effects of acupuncture. In short, acupuncture plays vital roles in AD by regulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and these effects are also correlated to acupoints and acupuncture methods. Selection of Acupoints It has been found that acupoints have better therapeutic effects than non-acupoints. For example, acupuncture at ST36 or sham acupoints could activate brain regions including the left hippocampus, the left orbital cortex, the left infralimbic cortex, the left olfactory cortex, the left cerebellum, and the left pons. However, ST36 group showed greater activation than that in sham-point group [82]. Compared with sham acupoints, MA at GV24 and GB13 can signi\u0000cantly improve glucose metabolism in the hypothalamus, thalamus, and brain stem [85]. In terms of restoring learning and memory ability, the effects of GV20 and BL23 are much better than that of sham acupoints [38]. GV20, which is located at the junction of the line connecting the apices of the ears and the midline, 5 cun from the anterior, is the most used acupoint for AD. When used alone or in combination with other acupoints, such as GV24, GV26, GV29, ST36 or BL23, all have good curative effects. The mechanism involves the reduction of A deposition, tau phosphorylation, neuron loss, neuroin\u0000ammation, promotion of neuron regeneration, brain energy metabolism and CBF, the regulation of microbiota-gut-brain axis and other aspects. BL23 is also often used in combination. According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, kidney de\u0000ciency is the basic pathogenic factor throughout the whole process of AD. Single acupoint of ST36 or HT7 shows speci\u0000c effects on brain glucose metabolism and CBF. Different from after- treatment, preventive EA may rescue cognitive dysfunction of AD via modulating the impaired microbiota-gut-brain axis [120]. It has been proved that Sanjiao acupuncture has the overall regulation effects on AD in multiple ways [35, 45, 58, 59]. Recently, it has been found that \"olfactory three-needle\" can also play roles in the treatment of AD. Olfaction is the most important sensory organ, and its center is in the hippocampus. It has been found that the olfactory dysfunction already existed at the early stage of AD. The severity of olfactory dysfunction can re\u0000ect the stages of AD and predict the progression of AD. Dysfunction \u0000rst occurs in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb, develops to the pre-olfactory nucleus and pyriform cortex, then spreads to the olfactory area and hippocampus, and \u0000nally affects the neocortex area. If the olfactory dysfunction can be detected and cured in time, it is of great signi\u0000cance for AD [69]. Stimulation mode Besides acupoints, the form and frequency of acupuncture are also important factors affecting the e\u0000cacy of acupuncture. Although EA and MA are different acupuncture methods, it has been shown that both are effective in treating AD. One study compared the e\u0000cacy of EA and MA at the same acupoint and found that, EA showed stronger inhibition of GSK-3 and reduction of tau phosphorylation in DRN of D-gal-induced AD mice [31]. However, in other studies, both EA and MA seem to have similar effects when used at the same points, which needs further exploration. Besides acupuncture alone, combination with other methods, such as electro-musical acupuncture, which combines music therapy and EA. Electro-musical acupuncture can transform musical rhythm into ever-changing frequency and waveform to overcome the shortcomings of human body tolerance to general EA [88]. Recently, stem cell therapy is also a promising treatment for AD, which could be improved by acupuncture in the survival rate and the e\u0000cacy of NSCs transplantation [45, 58, 59]. Moreover, there are studies compared the effects of EA with frequency of 2 Hz and 50 Hz, and found that although both of them can improve the learning and memory ability of A 1-42 induced AD rats, the effect of 50 Hz is better in enhancing hippocampal synaptic transmission [51]. Another study compared the effects of EA with 2, 30 and 50 Hz, and it was con\u0000rmed that high-frequency (50 Hz) is more effective than low-frequency (2 Hz) or medium-frequency (30 Hz) in restoring the ultrastructure of damaged synapses [42]. All these researches guide us to choose high frequency in the clinical treatment of AD, which might be more effective. Conclusion Acupuncture is an effective treatment for AD worldwide. Through an extensive review of the relevant papers in recent ten years, we found that the imbalance of microbiota-gut-brain axis might be the initial cause of AD, which could be adjusted by acupuncture. Acupuncture can regulate the species and structure of intestinal \u0000ora, repair the intestinal barrier and BBB, prevent in\u0000ammatory cytokines and harmful substances in the intestine from entering the blood and brain, and \u0000nally improve the cognitive impairment. In addition, the effect of acupuncture on AD also involves inhibiting A production, promoting A clearance, inhibiting tau phosphorylation, improving the structure and function of neurons and synapses, promoting nerve regeneration, relieving chronic neuroin\u0000ammation, regulating energy metabolism and CBF of the brain, etc. It is worth noting that the effect of acupuncture on AD is related to the selections of acupoints, the form and frequency of acupuncture, etc. Some special acupuncture methods, such as Sanjiao acupuncture and \"olfactory three-needle\" therapy, also provide new perspectives for AD. The therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of acupuncture on AD summarized in this study provide scienti\u0000c and reliable evidence for acupuncture clinical application for AD.
