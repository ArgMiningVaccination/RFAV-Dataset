Specifically, it acts as a hormone in that it helps regulate actions in cells. More closely, vitamin D is also known as \"calciferol\" because it promotes our gut to be able to use calcium. Our muscles also need vitamin D to move, and nerves need it to carry messages between the brain and body systems. \"Vitamin D can be produced by the action of sunlight on our skin,\" [Julie Garden-Robinson, PhD, RD](https://www.ndsu.edu/hnes/faculty_and_staff/julie_garden_robinson/), professor and licensed registered dietitian at North Dakota State University (NDSU) and food and nutrition specialist for NDSU Extension, told the New York Post. \"For that reason, vitamin D has been called the 'sunshine vitamin.' It can be found in some foods naturally [and, since it's present in a few foods naturally,] it was added to cow's milk originally as a public health measure.\" You may notice vitamin D fortified within other foods, including some breakfast cereals and fruit juices.

Here's are our-all-in-one guide to help you select the best one for you. As mentioned, consult with your medical advisor and/or doctor for further suggestions before intake. What is vitamin D? First things first \u2014 let's understand what exactly vitamin D is, and how it's essential for your body. \"Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is important for health,\" [C. Michael White, MD, PharmD](https://pharmacy.uconn.edu/person/c-michael-white/), distinguished professor and chair of the University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy, tells The Post. \"There are two main dietary forms, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol). Either form is fine to use but they need to be activated inside the body to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.\" Most people despite being in the sun and eating foods fortified with vitamin D are still vitamin D-deficient, though. This is why a supplement is helpful. \"The best sources of vitamin D can be found in foods like fatty fish like salmon, broccoli, fortified foods, mushrooms, eggs yolks, cod liver oil and more,\" [Bindiya Gandhi, MD](https://atlantaweightlossdoctor.com/), double-board-certified physician and integrative medicine doctor who focuses on holistic medicine, lists. What are the benefits of vitamin D? Much research has been undertaken on the functions of vitamin D in human health. \"Besides helping us build and maintain strong bones and teeth, researchers have linked vitamin D to roles in maintaining heart health and immune function,\" Dr. Garden-Robinson notes. \"Vitamin D may play a role preventing cancer, diabetes and other chronic diseases. Too little vitamin D may play a role in depression and other mental illnesses.\" Not to mention, high levels of vitamin d are important for decreasing inflammation, improving immune system, kidney function, bone health and so much more, according to Dr. Gandhi. \"It helps with calcium absorption, enhances muscle function, supports heart and brain [function] as well,\" she adds. What's the difference between vitamin D2 and vitamin D3? According to Garden-Robinson, vitamin D2 is the plant form of vitamin D, and vitamin D3 is naturally produced by humans and animals. \"Vitamin D3 is produced by our bodies by the action of sunlight on our skin,\" she elaborates. \"After taking in vitamin D from food or sunshine, a two-step process occurs in our bodies to convert vitamin D to its active form.\" Are vitamin D supplements necessary? In many cases, vitamin D supplements are indeed necessary. The 2018 [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6075634/) found insufficient vitamin D levels in more than 40% of people, with African American and Hispanic adults most likely to be deficient. \"For populations that get limited sun exposure (especially people in the northern U.S. during cold winter months), a vitamin D supplement usually is viewed as a good idea and may be prescribed by your healthcare provider,\" Garden-Robinson says. \"Multivitamin supplements usually contain vitamin D, so you may be taking a vitamin D supplement already.\" What is the most effective vitamin D to take? \"Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) usually is recommended because it is absorbed better than vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol),\" Garden-Robinson explains. \"For example, vitamin D3 often is obtained from sheep wool or a plant-based version may be obtained from plant sources (lichen). Vitamin D2 often is made from yeast.\" However, both vitamin D2 and D3 will help improve our vitamin D status. Both work in tandem as our bodies have a two-step process \u2014 that occurs in the liver and kidneys \u2014 to take vitamin D from food, supplements and sunlight to be used in our bodies. What to look for on a vitamin D supplement label, according to experts When shopping for a supplement, it's important to read the Nutrition Facts and other components of the label closely. \"When looking for a vitamin D supplement, look for the USP or NSF seal on the bottle,\" Dr. White advises. \"These independent labs have tested the product and assure it does not contain dangerous levels of heavy metals or prescription drugs and that the active ingredient is actually in the product.\" Other than that, try to aim for products that delivers no more than 100% of recommended levels. Vitamin D in excess may not provide the same benefits and can be harmful, he warns. On the same token, visit a healthcare provider before you take a supplement especially in amounts beyond 100% of the daily recommendation. \"You are always safe with a supplement with 100% of the daily value, but some people may need a higher dose based on blood tests,\" Garden-Robinson says. More, vitamin D3 usually is absorbed better, so nutrition experts recommend looking for that label designation. Specifically, the USP designation indicates quality and potency. Look for a reputable brand and check out the amount provided by a \"serving\" of the supplement, and check with your healthcare provider before going beyond 100% of the daily recommendation. \"You may need more than what is found in a serving, but medical testing will show your vitamin D status,\" she adds. All of our above picks have a safety designation label, along with third-party testing. How do vitamin D deficiencies occur? Some people do not have an adequate dietary intake and supplements are valuable additions to one's diet. \"People who have a limited diet (vegan, vegetarian, lactose intolerant) \u2014 or, another restrictive eating plan that requires dieting for an extended period of time \u2014 [may] have trouble absorbing nutrients from food because the have inflammation in their intestines (Celiac, Crohn's, Ulcerative Colitis), or take certain drugs like bile acid sequestration that block,\" White explains. Older women or more rarely men with, or at risk for, osteoporosis also need more vitamin D because vitamin D is critical in allowing the absorption of calcium into the body. \"Since corticosteroids like prednisone can demineralize bones, people chronically on this drugs could also benefit from vitamin D containing supplements,\" he adds. Garden-Robinson also lists subgroups who may naturally have a vitamin D deficiency: infants who are exclusively breastfed, older adults, homebound people, those who completely cover their heads and bodies with clothing for religious or cultural reasons, those with dark skin (especially African Americans) and certain medical conditions. These groups all \"block the absorption of dietary fat\" and \"are more likely to face deficiency.\" For infants, pediatricians typically recommend a vitamin D supplement. Be sure to check with a medical provider before supplementing an infant, though. Which vitamin D is best for deficiency? \"In terms of supplements, both vitamins D2 and D3 will help raise blood levels of vitamin D, but D3 tends to be more efficient in changing vitamin D status,\" Garden-Robinson says. \"Therefore, vitamin D3 is most commonly recommended.\" Although we caution against too much sun exposure, 15 minutes of sunlight exposure (without sunblock) twice a week during warmer summer months can be effective in improving our vitamin D status, according to Garden-Robinson. \"Keep in mind that 'artificial sun' from tanning beds is not effective in improving our vitamin D status,\" she adds. Checking your vitamin D status (through lab testing) in the middle of the winter and then in the summer can be a good measure of changes with the seasons, too. How to tell if you may be vitamin D deficient, according to experts Of course, visiting your doctor's office is the most accurate way to assess if you're low on vitamin D. However, our team of experts detail some telltale signs that may indicate a visit is necessary. \"The best indicator of [vitamin D deficiency](https://www.consumerlab.com/answers/vitamin-d-deficiency-symptoms/vitamin-d-deficiency/) is a blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D that is below 30 ng/mL,\" White explains, tapping into his pharmaceutical background. \"This is highly correlated with low bone density, balance issues and muscle pain.\" (Related: [Best blood pressure monitors](https://nypost.com/article/best-blood-pressure-monitors-per-experts/)). Headaches, bone pain and muscle weakness may also be associated with vitamin D deficiency - but they may also be associated with other conditions, according to Garden-Robinson. \"Difficulty sleeping, hair loss and depression could be linked with vitamin D status, among other things,\" she notes. What's the recommended amount of vitamin D to take? The [recommended dietary allowance (RDA)](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/) for vitamin D is 600 International Units from ages 1 to 70. Under age 1, the recommendation is 400 IU. People ages 70 or older have an RDA of at least 800 IU. Ahead, take a glimpse at the recommended intake levels for each age demographic: \"For most adults, the RDA is 600 to 800 IU a day, and 95% of people are absolutely fine with only this amount of intake,\" Gandhi notes. \"Patients with osteoporosis are recommended to take 800 to 1,000 IU a day.\" How does vitamin D differ from vitamin C? \"Vitamin C is an antioxidant and is used to prevent scurvy,\" White explains. \"It helps prevent tissue damage and promotes tissue repair. It's also important in helping people absorb iron from the diet into the blood.\" Also, because it's water-soluble, the risk of taking too much is less than with vitamin D, according to White. \"Vitamin C helps our bodies produce connective tissue, absorb iron and heal wounds, among its functions,\" Garden-Robinson adds. \"Like vitamin D, vitamin C also helps sustain a healthy immune system.\" How does a vitamin D supplement differ from a calcium supplement? Calcium is a mineral that requires vitamin D to be fully used by our bodies. \"We need calcium, vitamin D and other nutrients to maintain strong bones,\" Garden-Robinson notes. \"Some calcium supplements also contain vitamin D.\" What makes a vitamin D supplement vegan? As its name suggests, a vegan supplement would contain only plant-based materials. \"Vitamin D supplements can be made from either plant or animal sources,\" Garden-Robinson explains. \"While D3 (the typically better-absorbed form) is made from a component of sheep wool, it also can be made from plant material such as lichen.\" If a vitamin D supplement is made in a lab instead of derived from animal products, they are not considered natural, per White. According to the FDA, use of the term \"natural\" on food usually means that nothing synthetic is present. It's also important to note that supplements are not regulated the same way that foods are regulated. \"Without legal definitions for the use of 'natural' on supplements, [be cautious](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/using-dietary-supplements-wisely),\" Garden-Robinson advises. An overview of the different forms of vitamin D supplements you can buy Not all vitamin D supplements are created equal. Regardless of form, you'll be adding more vitamin D to your diet when you follow the instructions on the back of your product label. Vitamin D can be found in various forms such as liquid drops (often used for infants), liquid 'soft gels' in oil or dried in tablets. Some vitamins are in chewable form, too. According to [Consumer Lab](https://www.consumerlab.com/answers/is-there-a-difference-between-taking-vitamin-d-in-the-dry-form-versus-the-oil-capsules/dry-vs-oil/), an independent testing facility, \"the form itself is not as important as when you take it,\" Garden-Robinson points out. \"Taking vitamin D with a meal can increase the absorption up to 50%.\" What time of day should a vitamin D supplement be taken? Since vitamin D is fat-soluble, [taking the supplement](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20200983/) with a meal that includes fat in some form may boost its absorption. \"If your largest meal is at lunch or dinner, be sure to take the supplement at that time,\" Garden-Robinson advises. \"Try to be consistent in the time you take a supplement (or medication) to avoid forgetting to take it.\" (Related: [Best pill organizers](https://nypost.com/article/best-pill-organizers/)). Can a vitamin D supplement be taken with other medications? As a best practice, consult with a pharmacist about supplement-drug interactions. \"Always read the information provided with prescriptions, because it will provide interaction information,\" Garden-Robinson advises. You may have to space the supplement and the drug, depending on the medication. Some medications can affect vitamin D absorption as well. What to know about taking a vitamin D supplement with osteopenia \"Osteopenia is a condition of weakening bones due to loss of bone mass,\" Garden-Robinson explains. \"Women, especially Caucasian and Asian, are more at risk especially when estrogen levels decrease after menopause or after ovaries have been removed.\" Typically, osteopenia is diagnosed through a bone density test (DEXA is an example). In addition to a calcium-rich diet and weight-bearing physical activity, vitamin D and calcium supplements often are recommended to maintain bone health. What to know about taking a vitamin D supplement with osteoporosis \"Osteoporosis is a serious health condition marked by bone thinning ('porous bones') which makes people more likely to fracture their hip bones or spine, in particular,\" Garden-Robinson explains. \"Both men and women can get osteoporosis but women are more likely affected.\" Pharmaceuticals are available to treat [this condition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2621390/), in addition to nutrition (calcium, vitamin D) and physical activity. What to know about taking a vitamin D supplement during menopause Menopause ('the change of life') is a natural part of women's lives that usually begins in the mid-40s to mid-50s, marked by the end of menstruation ('periods') and childbearing years. \"It also can occur after a hysterectomy or removal of the ovaries,\" Garden-Robinson says. \"During this time, estrogen levels decrease.\" She further explains estrogen is a hormone that plays a role in bone health, and post-menopausal women may experience a loss in bone mass up to 5% per year in the years right after menopause. \" [Studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2621390/) that increased calcium and vitamin D intake through food or dietary supplements can reduce bone loss,\" she adds. What to know about taking a vitamin D supplement when pregnant or nursing It's recommended for those who are pregnant and nursing to continue taking a vitamin D supplement if previously used. \"The RDA for pregnant or breastfeeding women is the same as for any adults,\" Garden-Robinson notes. \"The recommended dietary allowance for pregnancy and lactation is 15 micrograms (600 international units) but your healthcare provider may recommend a higher doses.\" Taking a supplement is recommended and the levels of nutrients in the supplement should be discussed with a healthcare provider. Who may be at risk when taking a vitamin D supplement According to White, the following subgroups generally have a higher risk when taking a vitamin D supplement: - Poor dietary intake: egg yolk, dairy, fortified cereal, salmon - Reduced skin synthesis - UV light creates a vitamin D3 Cholecalciferol - Sunscreen use - Skin with more melanin content - Older age - Season, latitude, time of day - Exclusively breastfed infants - Human milk provides 25 IU per liter - Decreased bioavailability - Malabsorption syndromes - Body mass index >30 kg/m2 - Liver / kidney disease Long-term therapy with antiepileptic's Should kids and babies take a vitamin D supplement? \"Babies who are exclusively breastfed could be at risk of rickets (bone softening disease), especially if their mothers are deficient in vitamin D,\" Garden-Robinson says. \"The breastmilk of women who take vitamin D supplements is higher in vitamin D.\" Many healthcare providers recommend vitamin D supplements for infants who are exclusively breastfed, too. How to try to boost vitamin D levels without supplementation, per experts If you're wary about taking a vitamin D supplement, there are a few ways in which you can help boost your levels over time. \"Increase your daily intake of egg yolks, dairy products (milk, cheese), fortified cereals and salmon,\" White suggests. \"If you do this in lieu of other foods higher in saturated or trans fats \u2014 like red or processed meats or snack foods \u2014 you could improve your overall health while enhancing vitamin D as well. \" Also, get some sun each day but try to avoid prolonged direct sun exposure to your skin during the hours of 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. each day during the summer when the sun's rays are the most intense.
