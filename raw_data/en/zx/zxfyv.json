As used here, \" have Medicare\" means that you are entitled to benefits under Part A (receiving free Part A) or enrolled in Part B or Premium Part A. In-network Provider Network Aetna Student Health offers Aetna's broad network of In -network Providers. You can save money by seeing In -network Providers because Aetna has negotiated special rates with them, and because the Plan's benefits are better. If you need care that is covered under the Plan but not available from a n In-network Provider, contact Member Services for ass istance at the toll -free number on the back of your ID card. In this situation, Aetna may issue a pre- approval for you to receive the care from a n Out-of-network Provider. When a pre-approval is issued by Aetna, the benefit level is the same as for In -network Providers. Precertification You need pre -approval from us for some eligible health services. Pre -approval is also called precertification. Precertification for medical services and supplies In-network care Your in-network physician is responsible for obtaining any necessary precertification before you get the care. If your in - network physician doesn't get a required precertification, we won't pay the provider who gives you the c are. You won't have to pay either if your in-network phy sician fails to ask us for precertification. If your in-network physician requests precertification and we refuse it, you can still get the care but the plan won't pay for it . You will find additional details on requirements in the Certificate of Coverage . Out-of-network care When you go to an out -of-network provider, it is your responsibility to obtain precertification from us for any services and supplies on the precertification list. If you do not pre-certify there may be a penalty. Refer to your schedu le of benefits for this information. The list of services and supplies requiring precertification appears later in this section Precertification call Precertification should be secured within the timeframes specified below. To obtain precertification, ca ll Member Services at the toll-free number on your ID card.

If your pre -certified services are approved , the approval is valid for 30 as long as you remain enrolled in the plan . If you require an extension to the services that have been pre- certified, you, your physician, or the facil ity will need to call us at the number on your ID card as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than the final authorized day. If precertification determines that the stay or outpatient services and supplies are not covered benefits, the notification will explain why and how you can appeal our decision. You or your provider may request a review of the precertification decision. Se e the When you disagree - claim decisions and appeals procedures section of Certificate of Coverage.

University of Southern California 2018-2019 Page 7 Coordination of Benefits (COB) Some people have health coverage under more than one health plan. If you do, we will work together with your other plan(s) to decide how much each plan pays. This is called coordination of benefits (COB). Here's how COB works When this is the primary plan, we will pay your medical claims first as if the other plan does not exist When this is the secondary plan, we will pay benefits after the primary plan and will reduce the payment based on any amount the primary plan paid We will never pay an amount that, together with payments from your other coverage, add up to more than 100% of the allowable submitted expenses For more information about the Coordination of Benefits provision, including determining which plan is primary and which is secondary, you may call the Member Services telephone number shown on your ID card. A complete description of the Coordination of Benefits provision is contained in the Policy issued to School Name, and may be viewed online at www.aetnastudenthealth.com .
