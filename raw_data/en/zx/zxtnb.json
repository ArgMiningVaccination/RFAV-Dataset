If you do have oily hair then you might be wondering why and what you can do about it. In many cases, it can be reversed or reduced but in other cases not. These are just some reasons why you might have especially oily hair: - Genes- some of us just have that oily hair gene ( I know I do) and there isn't much to be done about it) - Hormones- hormone imbalances can cause the scalp to produce more sebum. There is usually another underlying cause for this so if you suspect a hormone imbalance speak to a medical professional. - Frequent washing- the more you wash the more you strip the scalp of its natural oils and the more it produces to make up for it. If your hair is especially oily try to use a natural, dry shampoo in between washes and try to not wash your hair every day- especially if you have long hair. - Unhealthy diet- health is holistic and diet affects absolutely everything not just our weight but how we look on the outside. An unhealthy diet is linked to excessive oil production. The same goes for stress. - Scalp conditions- If you have psoriasis or dermatitis then you might have oily hair as these conditions are related to excessive sebum production. Top Tips for Oily Hair If you have oily hair make sure you: - Don't overwash your hair. While it might be tempting to wash your hair daily for that clean, weightless feeling every day, it is true what they say. The more often you wash your hair, the greasier it'll get as this process strips hair of its natural oils. Try to wash your hair every second day at least and if you can try to go longer. You can also use dry shampoo in between washes if you need to. - Don't touch your hair. Oftentimes excess grease and oils builds up on our hands and fingertips throughout the day. When you touch your hair these impurities are transferred into your hair potentially making it greasier. Also, the more you touch the scalp, the more you promote the follicles to produce more sebum. It's best to just leave your hair alone. If you find that it doesn't stay still and it's always falling into your eyes, try tying it back or clipping it back away from your face. - Sometimes using too much shampoo can cause your hair to be greasy. Too much shampoo can cause it to build up over time while not making your hair any cleaner. - Make sure to fully rinse out the conditioner. Not rinsing your conditioner correctly means that it stays in your hair and that extra product build-up can contribute to oily hair. If you have oily hair try not to use conditioner at the roots and only at the tips. Make sure to rinse it out properly. It's also worth noting that if you are transitioning from conventional shampoo to a natural one your hair could be more greasy. Here's why. Conventional shampoos contain a lot of sulfates that actually remove the natural oils that protect the scalp. When moving to a natural shampoo your scalp might go through a detoxing phase where it produces more sebum to try to balance out the lack of sulfates. Consider this a detox that will get better with time. It's probably not the new natural products that are making your hair greasy. With time you'll find that natural hair products are better for you, your body and the environment.
