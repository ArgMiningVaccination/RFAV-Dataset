From the cohort study, we found that diet tended to cluster into 3 patterns. Interpreting the patterns using the ethnographic observations showed that the dietary clustering likely re flected dierences in meal organization driven by socioeconomic status (SES). In particular, families of higher SES could aord to prepare larger home-cooked meals on a regular basis while lower SES households had less-stable patterns and greater reliance on processed food. These ndings provide a more nuanced interpretation of dietary patterns observed in the Mexico population than is a orded by the food items alone (i.e. a \"healthy \"or\"pru- dent \"pattern versus \"unhealthy \"or\"Westernized \"). 1. Introduction Over the last several decades, Mexico has been in the midst of a nutrition transition, a process by which diets shift from more \"tradi- tional \"fruit, vegetable, and whole grain-based diets to more \"Westernized \"diets that are high in animal products, processed and energy-dense foods, and saturated fat ( Popkin ). The changing diet patterns in Mexico are accompanied by rising obesity and chronic dis- ease ( Popkin, Adair, & Ng, 2012). The climbing rates of childhood and adolescent obesity are particularly concerning; in Mexico it is estimatedthat > 30% of Mexican children and adolescents are overweight or obese ( Shamah-Levi, Cuevas-Nasu, Dommarco-Rivera, & Hernandez- Avila, 2016 ). While there are likely multiple causes, a Western diet has been identi ed as a key predictor of obesity and chronic disease mor- bidity in Mexican youth ( Guti\u00e9rrez-Pliego, Del 2016 ;Perng et al., 2017; Romero-Polvo et al., 2012). To more fully understand the role of the nutrition transition on health in Mexican adolescents and whether these changing dietarypatterns are modi able, it is necessary to consider what \"traditional \"or \"Western \"dietary patterns actually represent, and if theseeclassications are useful and accurate distinctions. To understand diet at the population-level, dietary patterns are often created using a data- driven approach that takes into account how closely di erent foods cluster in the diet. The drawback is that this approach is unable to as-certain the reasons behind the clustering, or the actual di erence among diets (apart from the food items) within a given population. Thenutrition transition framework is one way to understand this distinc- tion; e.g. a diet pattern high in fruits and vegetables may be in line with a\"traditional \"way of eating. Nonetheless, without additional in- formation, it is impossible to determine if the food is actually consumedin a traditional way in terms of food preparation, meal arrangements, etc. In contrast, direct observations of the diets of adolescents and their households within the population can provide insight into how the food is purchased, prepared, and consumed, and thus is pivotal for under- standing the dietary patterns that emerge from these data-driven ap- proaches. Another reason to explore dietary patterns in greater depth is to gain insights into the social contexts from which they arise, which is ultimately important for designing appropriate intervention frame- works. At the population level, the dietary changes related to the nu- trition transition occur at di erent rates according to socioeconomic https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2019.104542 Received 15 July 2019; Received in revised form 24 October 2019; Accepted 25 November 2019Corresponding author. 3863 SPHI, 1415 Washington address: janerica@umich.edu (E.C.

Tstatus (SES), such that higher SES households tend to incorporate \"Westernized \"food products into their diet rst due to the initial higher cost of these items. As the food environment changes and the productsbecome more available, the pattern reverses; and lower SES households begin to incorporate a greater array of processed foods into their diets (Popkin ). Currently, the Mexican population appears to be further along in the nutrition transition spectrum, with lower SES populations con-suming higher proportions of processed and re ned foods and higher SES populations with greater consumption of fresh fruits and vege-tables. Nonetheless, the precise nature of the SES and dietary pattern relationships are not well-described in Mexican adolescents. For ex- ample, do the di erences in dietary patterns between youth from lower versus higher SES households depend mostly on food availability andprice, or are they more fully explained by other factors such as time allocated to preparing food, shopping practices, knowledge of healthful eating, parental education levels, etc.? A few epidemiological studies in Mexican pediatric populations have explored the socioeconomic, household, or individual-level factors that are related to dietary patterns, yet with inconsistent ndings. One recent study examined a host of socioeconomic and household factorsin relation to diet, but after adjustment, only maternal occupation (administrative assistant or home compared to professional occupation) and child's screen time were associated with high fat and high sugar diet patterns ( Galvan-Portillo et al., 2018 ). Other studies that have explored dietary patterns among Mexican youth have noted associa-tions between lower quality diet patterns and individual-level char- acteristics including smoking ( Guti\u00e9rrez-Pliego et al., 2016), younger ages ( Romero-Polvo et al., 2012), and male sex ( Romero-Polvo et al., 2012 ). In contrast to the previous epidemiological analyses, which are ty- pically heavily-reliant on surveys to assess diet and other lifestyle characteristics, ethnographic observations involve direct observations of diet and daily life in the population of interest over long periods oftime ( Roberts, & Sanz, 2018). Thus, these observations can be an in- valuable source to understand dietary patterns within their socialcontext. In the present analysis, we used a cohort study of adolescents from Mexico City and an ethnographic study of several households from the same cohort to explore socioeconomic and lifestyle predictors of diet in Mexican adolescents. First, we identi ed dietary patterns and statistically evaluated their sociodemographic predictors in the cohortof 550 adolescents. Second, we used ethnographic data to characterize dietary patterns, with a focus on two households of varying socio- economic conditions. Finally, we incorporated both data sources to explore three questions: 1. Do dietary patterns that emerged in the epidemiological data match those observed in the ethnography and if so, how? 2. Can the ethnographic observations o er insights into the associa- tions (or lack of associations) between diet and socioeconomiccharacteristics reported from the larger cohort study? 3. How are processed and \"Western \"foods incorporated into the diet, as reflected in the clustering of these foods in the cohort study as well as the observation of their consumption in the ethnographicanalysis? Does this di er with respect to socioeconomic status? 2. Methods 2.1. Cohort study population Our study population includes adolescent participants from se- quentially-enrolled cohorts of the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to ENvironmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) study ( Hu et al., 2006; Surkan et al., 2008 ). Between 1994 and 2004, 1079 mother/child dyads were recruited from prenatal clinics of the Mexican Social Security Institute in Mexico City. Data for the present study was taken from an adolescent follow-up visit that occurred from 2015 to 2016 in a subset of 550participants from the original birth cohorts (cohorts two and three). Theinstitutional review boards at the Mexico National Institute of Public Health and the University of Michigan approved research protocols,and informed consent was obtained for all participants. 2.2. Dietary, sociodemographic, and health behavior assessment During the adolescent follow-up visit, trained interviewers ad- ministered a 112- item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaireto the adolescents to obtain information on typical consumption habits. The questionnaire asked adolescents to recall how often they had consumed one serving of a standard portion size of each food item over the previous week. Photographs of food items were provided as a visual aid. Response options ranged from never to 6 times per day. We converted the raw response values (1 -9) into servings/day. Sociodemographic and lifestyle factors that prior studies have ex- amined as predictors of dietary patterns in other Latin American set-tings ( Galvan-Portillo et al., 2018 ;Guti\u00e9rrez-Pliego et al., 2016 ;May\u00e9n et al., 2016; Romero-Polvo et al., 2012 ) were included in the present study, and include all the variables listed in Table 2. Information was collected 1) from mothers at the initial enrollment visit (maternal age,parity, and education) and 2) during the adolescent follow-up visit (current socioeconomic status, diet, and other health behaviors). At the adolescent follow-up visit, adolescents (with input from mothers when available) answered questions regarding socioeconomic status. This questionnaire was created by the Asociaci\u00f3n Mexicana de Agencias de Investigaci\u00f3n de Mercados y Opini\u00f3n P\u00fablica (Mexican Association of Marketing Research and Public Opinion Agencies) to evaluate house- hold resources, including education of the household head, number of rooms in the house, number of vehicles owned, ownership of particular appliances (e.g. microwave and washing machine), and access to in-ternet. The index consists of 7 categories ranging from A/B (highest SES) to E (lowest SES). Participants also completed questionnaires concerning daily activ- ities. To calculate average hours of physical activity per week, we added the self-reported time in hours spent in all potential physical activities (e.g. soccer, volleyball, running). The education status of the adolescent was based on current self-report: attending primary school, attending secondary school, attending post-secondary education, or not attending any educational program. Sleep duration was measured with actigraph watches for up to 7 days following the visit. It was averaged over the 7 days and categorized, based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine age-speci c guidelines ( Paruthi et al., 2016), as meeting sleep duration recommendation or not meeting sleep duration re-commendations. 2.3. Ethnographic study and observations Since 2012, we have conducted ethnographic observation of a subset of ELEMENT participants in ELEMENT study settings and in their homes. Nine families with children in the ELEMENT cohort who lived in one of two focal neighborhoods were invited to participate, and six agreed. From August 2014 through July 2015, we conducted an in- tensive ethnographic observation of these six ELEMENT families that involved participant-observation and iterative unstructured interviews. Specically, the ethnographer (LFS) spent time in each family home for 3-6 h at a time, returning multiple days each week for a six-month period in each neighborhood (August 2014 -January 2015 and February 2015 -July 2015) to observe and participate in the families 'daily rou- tines, including larger neighborhood activities such as festivals andpolitical events. The ethnographer also spent time with other neighbor families in both neighborhoods to obtain a sense of how typical the focal households were. We have continued intermittent ethnographic observations with these same six families and neighborhoods, and in February 2018 we conducted a few supplemental interviews with household members of the six families that focused speci cally onE.C. Jansen, et al. Appetite 147 (2020) 104542 2typical individual and family eating patterns. All observations were documented through extensive eld notes and photographs, and interviews were recorded and then transcribed. The ethnography was coded in Atlas TI by members of our ethnographic coding lab, meaning that tags were applied to the eldnotes to highlight dierent aspects of life, including eating events. This included refer- ences to eating, cooking, shopping, discussing food, etc. For this paper, we describe in detail the diets and eating habits of two families in the ethnographic study. While we drew from all of our ethnographic data (including the six households and neighbors), we decided to write speci cally about these two households because they had the clearest contrasts with regards to diet and household nancial stability. Nonetheless, the overall eating patterns and observations about determinants of these eating patterns were informed by the broader data from the six households and neighborhoods (who re- presented a wide range of economic circumstances). To protect the identities of the families, each household member was given a pseu- donym. 3. Data analysis3.1. Part 1 To identify dietary patterns, we rst used principal component analysis (PCA), a data-reduction method that groups foods together based on how correlated they are with one another. Each pattern is characterized by the foods that have the highest factor loadings; for example, a pattern with high factor loadings on rice and beans means that those foods are likely to be consumed together often (they may be as a part of the same meals but not necessarily). The methodology for dietary pattern identi cation is described in detail elsewhere ( Perng et al., 2017 ). Brie fly, we grouped similar food items into categories based on nutritional similarity ( Supplemental Table 1 for the complete list), and computed total-energy adjusted food group intakes using the residual method ( Willett, Howe, & Kushi, 1997). We next performed principal component analysis of the food groups, and rotated with or-thogonal transformation to obtain uncorrelated factors. We determined the number of factors to retain based on visual inspection of the Scree plot, eigenvalues > 1, and interpretability. We considered food groups with factor loadings > 0.25 or < -0.25 to provide meaningful inter- pretation of the pattern, although all food groups contributed to the computation of the dietary pattern score. Dietary pattern scores for each participant were computed by multiplying the factor loadings of each food (see Table 1) by the frequency of consumption of that food group. Finally, we summed the food group loadings for each factor toobtain the dietary pattern scores for each pattern. In sensitivity ana- lyses, we also performed principal component analysis of the food groups strati ed by socioeconomic status (upper two categories versus lower two categories). To evaluate associations between sociodemographic characteristics and dietary patterns, we examined mean \u00b1 SD dietary pattern factorscores according to categories of maternal and adolescent character- istics. For ordinal characteristics, we conducted a test for linear trend by including in the model a continuous variable representing the or- dinal levels of the characteristic. For nominal characteristics, we uti- lized a type-III Wald test. Finally, we conducted multivariable linear regression analysis in which each dietary pattern score was the out- come, and predictors were mutually adjusted for one another. All analyses were conducted in Stata 14.0, and statistical signi cance was considered at p< 0.05. 3.2. Part 2 In order to describe the daily dietary patterns and food habits of the two focal families, headed by women we call Alma and Renata, wereviewed all ethnographic notes that were coded as a \"food event \"(related to food purchase, preparation, or consumption) during visits with these households of interest. These included descriptions of foods events (meals, shopping trips, etc.) from the ethnographer as well as direct quotes from the participants during interviews. Similarly, we reviewed all photographs from these families to identify food events, many of which included photographs of plates of food. In addition to describing the overall food habits in the two households, we con- structed a timeline of a typical day's eating for the households of Alma and Renata. For the timeline, we selected relevant photographs toportray both individual food items and the context of the food en- vironment. 3.3. Part 3 Finally, we considered our three mixed-methodology research questions. As a research team, which included a mixture of nutritional researchers and anthropologists, we compared/contrasted the ndings from Part 1 and Part 2 to answer each of the three speci c questions. The data analysis approach draws from a \"concurrent nested de- sign\"mixed-methods design typology ). It was \"concurrent \"in that the data collection of the quantitative and qualitative studies occurred approximately simultaneously, and it was \"nested\" since the analysis of the quantitative data (part 1) drove a deeper investigation using the qualitative data (part 3). It can also beunderstood from the \"following a thread \"data integration method (O'Cathain, Murphy, & Nicholl, 2010), since the quantitative ndings were extended and explored in the qualitative data.Table 1 Factor loadings of food groups for three dietary patterns.

Using principal components analysis, we identi ed 3 dietary patterns ( Table 1). The rst, which we describe as the Plant-based & lean proteins pattern, was characterized by high intake frequency of vegetables, fruit, soup, sh, water and un- sweetened drinks, and high fat dairy. The second pattern, which we callMeat & starchy, was marked by high intake frequency of \"Western \" processed foods including chips, re ned grains, sugar-sweetened bev- erages, processed meat, and high-fat dairy, as well as foods more in line with \"traditional \"foods such as the Mexican food group (e.g. tacos and quesadillas), potatoes and fried plantains, soup, legumes, and corntortillas. The third pattern was characterized by high intake frequency of rened grains, milk, sweetened milk, mayonnaise or margarine, and eggs; this was called the Eggs, milk & re ned grain pattern. In sensitivity analyses, we replicated the above process separately for lower and higher SES groups. In this SES strati ed analysis, the rst pattern ( Plant- based & lean proteins pattern) appeared with very little variation in both SES groups. The second and third patterns di ered according to some food items (e.g. fast food loaded highly in the second pattern for lowSES but highly in the third pattern for high SES) but were not sub- stantially di erent. Due to the robustness of the dietary patterns when stratied by SES, the below results are based on the dietary patterns identied in the full sample. Table 2 presents the characteristics of the study sample and their associations with each dietary pattern. The average \u00b1 SD age of the participants was 14.5 \u00b1 2.1 years old, and 51.8% were female. The average total energy intake of the study population was 2297 \u00b1 922 Calories. In unadjusted analyses, adolescents whose mothers had fewer prior pregnancies (proxy for fewer siblings) and higher levels of edu- cation had higher scores in the Plant-based & lean proteins dietary pat- tern. In contrast, higher household SES was related to lower scores in theEggs, milk & re ned grain pattern. Scores in the Meat & starchy pat- tern did not di er with respect to any of the measured maternal or child characteristics. In adjusted analysis, the associations with maternal education and SES persisted in the Plant-based & lean proteins andEggs, milk & re ned grain patterns, respectively, albeit slightly attenuated (Table 3). To illustrate, children whose mothers did not complete sec- ondary school had 0.28 units lower scores in the Plant-based & lean proteins dietary pattern compared to those whose mothers had com- pleted higher education (95% CI -0.59 to 0.03; P, trend = 0.06).Children from households in the lowest SES category had 0.31 units (95% CI 0.04 to 0.57; P, trend = 0.02) higher adjusted Eggs, milk & rened grain dietary pattern scores than those in the highest SES households. 5. Results- part 25.1. Ethnographic households-mothers Alma and Renata Although both Alma and Renata's households were categorized in the lower quartiles of SES based on responses to the epidemiological questionnaire, there were economic di erences between the two. Alma had two daughters (aged 9 and 5 at the start of the study) and livedwith her husband Ra\u00fal in an extended family compound that was home to nine people in total. Ra\u00fal had stable, formal-sector employment, which meant they had access to state-sponsored health care. They also had running water seven days a week. Renata also lived in a family compound that included three other units in addition to the two roomsshe occupied with her husband and children (two girls and a boy, all 12 or older at the start of the study). But, unlike Alma, Renata's family had greater economic insecurity. While Renata's husband regularly worked low-paid construction jobs and she had occasional informal work such as selling home-made food through street-vending, no one in the im- mediate household maintained formal-sector employment.Additionally, Renata's household only had access to running waterthree days a week, which a ected meal preparation and clean up. Alma's and Renata's routines were both lled with the daily work of food: shopping for food, preparing food, selling food (Renata), serving and eating food with their families, and cleaning up afterwards. This was typical of women from their neighborhoods: although women in these neighborhoods often engaged in informal sector work, such as selling beauty products to each other or preparing food-items like sandwiches to sell from a basket, they were primarily occupied with domestic work in their homes. 5.2. Meal structure Both families loosely followed the typical meal pattern structure in Mexico, where the later afternoon meal, called comida was the largest. Comida (translated as both \"meal \"and \"food \") is typically a home- cooked meal, and most often occurred between 1 and 4 PM in their households. It was the most social and elaborate meal of the day. Other meals included breakfast, a small mid-morning meal called almuerzo (translated as \"lunch \"), an afternoon snack, and a small-to-medium sized meal in the evening for dinner ( Fig. 1). In Alma's family, the day started around 7:45 a.m. with a breakfast of corn flakes and milk for her and her daughters. The girls took a packed lunch to school, which often consisted of a ham sandwich onwhite bread and a bottle of water. School regulations speci ed that only water could be sent with children in their lunch. For a time after thisrule was instated, Alma would ll her daughter's water bottles with clear soda ( Roberts, & Sanz, 2018 ). Alma made comida every day, and on a typical day Alma might prepare fresh tomato soup with pasta, homemade green salsa (comprised of tomatillos, chilis, potatoes, car- rots, and onions) a dish of fried pork bellies or fat called chicharron,rice or fried pasta, and a sausage called longaniza . When Alma picked her younger daughter up from school, she usually bought hersnacks \u2014such as sugary yogurt, Cheetos, candy, or churros \u2014which her daughter ate before they arrived home.. Alma and her youngerdaughter would then eat comida when they arrived home. Alma's older daughter ate a packed lunch during her day at school, and then atecomida around 5 PM when she got home. When Alma's husband got home at 8 PM he would eat the food from comida that everyone had eaten earlier in the day. The rest of the family ate a light meal or snack around this time, like pan dulce (sweet bread) or tacos brought from a street stall near their house. They might also have leftovers from co- mida. In Renata's family the meal times were more likely to vary. Breakfast was around the same time, 7:45 or 8 a.m., and typicallyconsisted of co ee and tamales (steamed corn cakes). Around mid- morning, they would have a snack such as a gordita (a pastry stu ed with meat, cheese, or other savory llings). Similarly to Alma's family, comida was made at home most days from fresh ingredients and in- cluded a vegetable-heavy soup followed by a meat dish. The meat dish could be chicken with green chili sauce, accompanied by tortillas and soda or fruit- flavored water. The timing of comida was anywhere be- tween 1 and 3 p.m. Renata's children were not always able to attendschool because of fears of violence in their neighborhood. They often bought snack foods on the street throughout the afternoon, such as cup- of-noodles or chicharron. The evening meal often consisted of foods Renata prepared that day to sell from her basket, such as tacos. 5.3. Shopping Alma shopped for food at both the open-air market ( tianguis ) in her neighborhood and the nearest Bodega Aurera , a supermarket chain owned by Wal-Mart. Her husband's secure formal sector job was a large factor in their dietary stability, and enabled their day-to-day food op- tions to encompass a greater variety.

Renata shopped for fresh fruits and vegetables about once a week at the central food market in Mexico City, La Merced . The whole trip took most of the day including public transport time but was worth it to herbecause prices at La Merced were signi cantly lower. She also planned her trips to the supermarket chain in order to get her non-producestaples based on when the store o ered discounts. Otherwise, the family shopped meal-to-meal, with family members often instructed to pur-chase items as needed (sometimes on credit) at corner stores near their house. As a result, home meals were often planned around what was cheapest at the store, for example beans and rice from the supermarket with a green salsa made from tomatillos from La Merced . These comida meals also tended to be smaller than Alma's, meaning there was rarelyfood left over. Breakfast food, as well as food for mid-morning and afternoon snacks, usually came from food Renata sold through her own street-vending that day, or items bartered for or purchased in- expensively from other street-vendors. Notably, the foods Renata'sfamily ate outside of their daily comida were often inexpensive and convenient packaged foods, and family members tended to eat a higher proportion of their total calories from street food and from smaller meals with cheaper sources of protein (e.g. eggs or cup-o-noodles) than members in Alma's household. As a whole, it was more di cult to identify consistent dietary patterns in Renata's family, which re flected their lack of steady income. 5.4. Summary of main similarities and di erences between households Overall, the main di erences observed in the families were Alma's ability to buy produce ahead of time and to plan meals that included leftovers, versus relying on purchasing items ad hoc from local stores; Alma's greater disposable income for purchasing extra snacks; and the regularity of meal times. The similarities in meal content, however, were striking between the two families. Both families ate a large, home- cooked meal ( comida ) which included a protein, a starch, and a large quantity of cooked vegetables in the soup and/or salsa. They also bothTable 3 (continued ) Adjusted di erences (95% Con dence Intervals)a Plant-based & lean proteins Meat & starchy Eggs, milk & re ned grain P value 0.89 0.36 0.17 aFrom separate linear regression models with each dietary pattern as a continuous outcome, and all the variables listed in the table as categorical predictors.

Nonetheless, Alma more often purchased these snacks as extra treats, consumed in addition to regular meals, while Renata's household more often ate these food items as meals. Thus, even though there were clear di erences in diet, the di erences were not apparent in the actual foods themselves as they were in thedaily patterns of consumption (see Supplemental Table 2 for examples of food consumed at each meal from the eldnotes). 5.5. Adolescent eating behaviors Although a main focus in the ethnography was on the mothers in the households, the eating behaviors of the adolescents deserves a special note. Adolescents, especially the older adolescents, in these households had freedom to make their own food choices, and spent some time away from the house with friends when they might have a snack or a soda. However, the eating patterns away from home were not much di erent from what they would consume at home. For example, Renata's ado-lescents would be just as likely to eat a microwaveable noodle cup at home with their mother as on their own or with friends. Furthermore, all the adolescents in both households (and across the other four fa- milies not reported in detail here) routinely came home for the daily comida. 6. Results part 3 Question 1 : Do dietary patterns that emerged in the epidemiological data match those observed in the ethnography and if so, how? Answer : The dietary patterns derived from the epidemiological study-namely the Plant-based & lean proteins ,Meat & starchy , and Eggs, milk & re ned grain could also be observed in the ethnographic ob- servations, although di erently than expected. Whereas the epidemio- logical interpretation of these dietary patterns might suggest that Plant- based & lean proteins pattern was more re flective of an adolescent fol- lowing a \"traditional \"or\"prudent \"overall diet whereas the Meat & starchy , and Eggs, milk & re ned grain patterns were more in line with a \"Western \"or\"transitioning \"pattern, the ethnographic observations suggested a more nuanced interpretation. In particular, the ethno- graphic observations indicated that each dietary pattern may be in- dicative of di erent meals or eating events that take place over the course of a day. The Plant-based & lean proteins pattern was most con- sistent with a speci c meal, comida , that usually contained grains, ve- getables, proteins and starches. Across all households observed in theethnographic study, comida almost universally contained a high variety of vegetables, often in the form of salsas and soups, as well as some typeof meat like chicken or beef. The Eggs, milk & re ned grain pattern was also associated with particular meals, notably with smaller meals in-cluding breakfast and the mid-morning snack. In contrast, the Meat & starchy pattern was not necessarily indicative of a particular meal, but was made up of foods that were frequently purchased and consumed outside the home from street vendors (e.g. tortillas, meat, sugar-swee- tened beverages, fried tortilla foods). These ndings suggest that a child with a higher score on the Plant- based & lean proteins pattern may come from a household more similar to Alma's, with regular comida meals consumed at mid-day as well as for leftovers for dinner or lunch the next day. In contrast, a child with higher scores on the Eggs, milk & re ned grain orMeat & starchy pattern may indicate a child more aligned with Renata's family, where a highercaloric content comes from smaller meals and/or snacks purchased outside the home. Question 2 : Can the ethnographic observations o er insights into the associations (or lack of associations) between diet and socioeconomic orlifestyle characteristics reported from the larger cohort study? Answer: In the epidemiological data analysis, household socio- economic factors, including maternal education and household SES, were the most strongly associated predictors of dietary patterns.Interpreted from a nutrition transition framework, the associationswere generally in line with a population in the latter stages of the nu- trition transition, in that the higher SES households (proxied by ma- ternal education) had higher consumption of fruits and vegetables. The ethnographic observations suggested a more speci c interpretation, in that the di erences in diet according to SES may have to do with dif- ferences in the structure of eating throughout the day and the economic ability to plan ahead for meals. Alma's family (the family with greater economic stability) had a predictable and regular eating schedule, which was largely structured by her two daughters' school schedules and her husband's work schedule. Her family had very regular comida meals, which she planned and purchased food for several days in ad-vance. In addition, her family's day often included pre-packed lunches. In contrast, Renata's family \u2014which could not rely on a steady income and whose children could not attend school regularly because of schoolviolence \u2014had an irregular eating schedule, with timing of eating events varying day-to-day. Of note, variations in diets in the morestable household versus lower-stability households did not rely on dif- ferences in time allocation or cooking knowledge between the mothers. Question 3 : How are processed and \"Western \"foods incorporated into the diet, as re flected in the clustering of these foods in the cohort study as well as the observation of their consumption in the ethno-graphic analysis? Does this di er with respect to socioeconomic status? Answer : Processed and westernized foods were noted in all three of the epidemiological dietary patterns, to varying degrees. In the Plant- based & lean proteins pattern, only one food group that could be con- sidered westernized, which was high fat dairy, loaded positively. The other two patterns had a greater number of processed or westernized food items; for example, Meat & starchy had high fat dairy, re ned grains, processed meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages, and Eggs, milk &r ened grain had western products such as re ned grain and spreads like margarine and mayonnaise. The ethnographic notes revealed even less separation between consumption of \"traditional \"and westernized foods. Processed and westernized foods were widely incorporated into practically all mealsthroughout the day, with processed foods often inserted into traditional dishes or meals. For example, in one day's comida Renata's family ate frozen French fries ( \"Western \") with their main course of homemade meat ( \"traditional \"). Alma's family had tacos ( \"traditional \") with canned tuna ( \"Western \") in them for their comida one day. The starkest dierence we noted in the consumption of processed foods was that Renata's family more often consumed processed foods as part of theirmain meals, while Alma's family ate processed snacks and desserts in addition to their fruit and vegetable-rich home-cooked meals. 7. Discussion In this paper, we evaluated patterns of eating among adolescents in Mexico City in two distinct but complementary ways. First, using epi- demiological data from 550 participants in the longitudinal ELEMENT study, we identi ed three dietary patterns: Plant-based & lean proteins , Meat & starchy , and Eggs, milk & re ned grain. Interpreted in light of the nutrition transition, the rst fruit and vegetable-based pattern appears in line with a more \"traditional \"or\"prudent \"diet while the latter two are more in line with a \"Western \"pattern. Further, the quantitative analysis revealed that higher maternal education (considered a proxyfor higher SES) was associated with higher Plant-based & lean proteins scores, and that lower SES was associated with higher Eggs, milk & re- ned grain pattern scores; these associations are consistent with a po- pulation in the latter stages of the nutrition transition. Incorporating ethnographic information from households within the cohort sheds a more nuanced perspective of the diet patterns and their SES correlates. Specically, we found that the empirically-derived dietary patterns may be more fully understood as particular eating events, with scores on thedietary patterns representing the type of meal patterning in the household (e.g. the pattern high in fruits and vegetables may indicate aE.C. Jansen, et al. Appetite 147 (2020) 104542 8household with a consistent comida and substantial leftovers consumed later in the day). Further, the associations between SES indicators and diet could have to do with di erences in the economic ability to plan and prepare large home-cooked meals (i.e. higher SES households couldaord to buy a wide variety food in advance). Instead, lower SES fa- milies may have less structured meal times and may be more likely torely on cheaper and heavily-processed food for meals than those from higher SES households. The dietary patterns we identi ed using factor analysis mirror those of dietary patterns previously described in the ELEMENT cohort ( Perng et al., 2017) as well as other studies conducted in Mexico ( Guti\u00e9rrez- Pliego et 2011 ;Romero-Polvo et al., 2012 ). In general, these prior studies identi ed one healthier pattern (often called \"Prudent \") that is characterized by fruits, vegetables, whole grain, and lean proteins, and other less healthy patterns (often called \"Western \"or\"transitioning \") that are characterized by energy- dense and meat-based foods as well as vegetable oils and sugar-swee-tened beverages, patterns that align with our Plant-based & lean proteins and Meat & starchy patterns. In addition, our Eggs, milk & re nedgrain pattern was similar to the \"egg\"and \"milk and sweetened breads \" patterns reported in an analysis of breakfast habits in the Mexican pe-diatric population ( Afeiche et al., 2397 ). The similarities in dietary patterns between previous studies and ours is salient because it meansthat our ethnographic insights may extend beyond this particular co- hort of Mexican adolescents. One of our main ndings was that the dietary patterns we identi ed may re flect meal patterns within households rather than overall dietary patterns. For example, having a higher Plant-based & lean proteins dietary pattern may not re flect an individual participant following an overall healthy diet or traditional lifestyle, but rather it may reveal thestability of comida consumption in his or her household. Furthermore, it was evident that there were few real distinctions between adolescents who followed more \"traditional \"diets versus \"Western \"diets in terms of food, as elements of \"Westernized \"and \"traditional \"were present in both households 'diets, and during all meals and eating events throughout the day. This co-occurrence suggests that instead ofadopting a more \"Westernized \"pattern of eating and living, households may simply be incorporating certain \"Western \"foods into their typical meals and lifestyles. The fact that the di erences in diet may have more to do with di erences in meal patterning implies that previous re- lationships between similar dietary patterns and health outcomes could potentially be explained by characteristics of meal patterns-such as timing, stability, or social connections during meals-rather than the individual foods in the dietary patterns. To explore these potential as- sociations, future surveys should include questions about timing of the meals, where meals are taken (at home versus restaurant or street), as well as how particular foods are linked to speci c meals. More broadly, ourndings illustrate that simply naming dietary patterns as \"Western \" or\"traditional \"may lead to oversimpli ed interpretations of how diet appears in everyday life. For example, \"Western \"and \"traditional \" terms may be used (whether explicitly or implicitly) as a proxy for \"unhealthy \"versus \"healthy \"diet patterns, which could ignore the fact that the diet patterns with \"Western \"food could also have positive correlations with foods that are associated with better health (e.g. fruits and vegetables) or vice versa. For example, within the Meat & Starchy pattern, we showed positive factor loadings for multiple processedfoods (re ned grain, chips, and sugar-sweetened beverages) as well as soup (a vegetable-rich food item). Furthermore, this labeling may leadto a false sense of comparability between countries, when in fact a \"Western \"diet likely looks very di erent in the US compared to Mexico, or in Mexico compared to other countries in the midst of nu-trition transitions (e.g. China or Brazil). In a similar vein, a \"traditional \" pattern may not necessarily be clear either, as it can depend on the timeperiod and region of interest. Thus, we recommend that data-driven dietary patterns should be named for their food components and not fortheir subjective classi cation as \"traditional \",\"transitioning \"or \"Westernized. \" The second overarching theme highlighted from this mixed- methods analysis was that, as expected, household socioeconomicstatus was one of the most important predictors of diet in Mexico City adolescents. Indeed, although we examined a host of individual-level factors in the epidemiological analyses, only maternal education (which we considered a proxy of SES) and SES (based on an index of household resources) were associated with two of the dietary patterns after ad- justment for confounding factors. These associations were mirrored in the ethnographic observations, where we found that there were dif- ferences in dietary patterns in the household with lower versus higher economic stability. Speci cally, there were di erences in the organi- zation of shopping, food storage, and meal preparation in the householdof lower versus higher economic stability. There were also di erences where families shopped; more stable households tended to do more ofthe shopping at local outdoor markets and large supermarkets while less-stable households more heavily relied on local corner stores where they could purchase cheap food on credit. Interestingly, we found that economic stability associated with diet in ways that may both bene t and detract from health. On one hand, economic stability allowed forgreater organization and planning of the mid-day meal, which often contains the healthiest and freshest food items. Many of the foods ty- pically consumed for comida , such as sh, leafy greens, fresh vegetables, and fruit, are among the foods with the highest per calorie prices inMexico ( Mendoza, P\u00e9rez, Aggarwal, & Drewnowski, 2017 ). At the same time, we found that economic stability also enabled greater ability topurchase extra meals and snacks that were typically high in calories, fat, and added sugar; and available at nearly every street corner ( Bridle- Fitzpatrick, 2015). It should be noted that economic stability was not apart of the SES questionnaire administered in the broader cohort (based on household possessions), and thus we posit that a questionnaire in- corporating this aspect of life would have been a stronger indicator ofeconomic situation and more strongly associated with the diet patterns. There are multiple strengths of this study. The epidemiologic sample included a large sample size and used the same food frequency ques- tionnaire as the national nutrition surveys in Mexico, making the results directly comparable to other estimates of dietary intake/patterns in Mexico. We were able to examine a number of di erent factors that are potentially important determinants of dietary habits. One of the lim-itations was the small sample size of the ethnographic observations. Nonetheless, ethnography has been shown to be a valid approach to gathering data because the intensive and repetitive nature of the re- search provides a more detailed and complex portrait of daily activities, and of the economic and social constraints on food-consumption, than can be gained from surveys or interviews alone. Given the extensive time period of observation and the nature of ethnography (e.g. re- servation of comments about eating or other lifestyle behaviors), it is very unlikely families would change their eating habits during the ethnographic observation (i.e. social desirability bias). In addition, al- though we focused on two speci c families, we also drew insights from at least 6 other households where we spent substantial time and fromlarger neighborhood events. The generalizability of the ndings may also be somewhat limited, particularly in populations outside ofMexico. In addition, the cohort was considered representative of mid-to lower-SES in Mexico; thus it does not generalize to higher-income po- pulations where mothers are more likely to have formal-sector em- ployment, or to very low-income households. Another limitation is the potential bias due to self-reported diet in the FFQ, which could be due to social desirability biases as well as random error in recall. Further, we did not collect information in the epidemiological sample con- cerning individual eating occasions or meal timing. In summary, we identi ed three dietary patterns in a population of Mexico City adolescents and found that they were associated with so- cioeconomic indicators in an expected manner. Yet, the ethnographic observations o ered a more speci c interpretation, which was thatE.C. Jansen, et al. Appetite 147 (2020) 104542 9families with greater economic resources may be more likely to have organized shopping trips and consistent home-cooked meals and eating schedules, while lower SES households were more likely to shop and eat meal-to-meal. Further, while all participants consumed calorie-dense, highly processed food, there may be di erent reasons behind the con- sumption of these items across SES levels (hunger-satiating versus theability to consume of \"extras \"). Overall, this work contributes to our understanding of dietary patterns in Mexico and encourages a morenuanced view on how families may perceive the feasibility of dietary interventions or advice. More broadly, this paper serves to encourage and inform further mixed-methods research, with the aim of aug- menting epidemiological ndings on nutrition with rich contextual data about diet in daily life.
