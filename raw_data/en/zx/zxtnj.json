Keloid scars are a growth of more than normal scar tissues and can be caused by acne, burns, piercings, surgery, vaccinations, and even from minor scratches or cuts. They can be flesh colored, red, or pink, and they are often lumpy or have ridges of extra tissue. Keloid scars are not necessarily painful but can be irritated by clothing or any rubbing. Individuals with dark skin tend to be more prone to keloid formation, but men and women are about equally affected.

Good skin care is essential in the treatment of any skin condition, and keloids are no exception. Keeping your skin clean and moisturized will encourage skin rejuvenation \u2014 this means that the older, scarred skin will be sloughed away and replaced with the newer, smoother layers underneath. - Wash the scarred skin at least once a day (twice if it's on your face) with a gentle cleanser that contains no colors or fragrances. Be sure not to over wash the skin, however, as this can dry it out and cause irritation. - Moisturize the skin after cleansing to keep it hydrated. You can use a gentle store-bought moisturizer or apply a natural oil such as coconut or olive oil. [[2]](#_note-2)X Research source - 2Wear suntan lotion every day to avoid damaging the skin. Scarred skin is particularly sensitive, making it prone to burning and hyperpigmentation caused by the the harmful rays of the sun. As a result, it is important to apply suntan lotion to keloid scars if you intend to spend any time outside throughout the day. Advertisement - Use a high SPF of thirty or above, and remember to apply it to the skin at least thirty minutes before going outside. - The sun's rays can be damaging on the skin, even when it's not hot or sunny outside. Therefore, it's important to apply suntan lotion regardless of the weather. - 3Don't pick at the scars. When you have a cut or small scar on the skin, it can be very tempting to pick at it. However, this is a bad idea as it often leads to infection and the formation of keloid scars. - Try to leave any cuts alone to prevent the formation of keloids and avoid touching any existing keloids, as this can simply aggravate them further. - If you leave your scars alone, there's a good chance that they will disappear on their own over time, without the need for medical intervention. - 4Use an organic scar cream that contains onion extract. Recent studies have shown promising data with scar creams that contain onion extract when it comes to reducing the height of scar tissue.

You can apply lemon juice to darker scars in order to lighten them. Vitamin C is important in normal wound healing, and the high concentration of vitamin C in lemon juice can help lighten scars. [[5]](#_note-5)X Research source Moores, J. (2013). Vitamin C: a wound healing perspective. British Journal Of Community Nursing, 18S6-s11. Use a cotton ball soaked in lemon juice and apply directly to the scar. Allow the lemon juice to air dry and rinse with warm water. Repeat once a day. - Be aware that exposing the lemon-juice treated skin to sunlight may result in bleaching. - While most steps described later in this method can be used in conjunction, do not try mixing lemon juice with other remedies. If you want to use other methods that you apply to the scar concurrently, then rinse off the lemon juice and wait two to three hours beforehand. - 6Use castor oil to break down scar tissue and detoxify the skin. Castor oil has the ability to penetrate deep into the skin and slowly break down scar tissue. In healthy skin cells, it helps to increase circulation and eliminate toxins. - To treat keloids, soak a piece of clean cloth in castor oil and press it onto the keloid for an hour or two every day. Alternatively, you can just rub castor oil directly onto the keloid everyday. - You may also use castor oil to prevent keloid formation in the first place by applying the oil directly onto cuts or scrapes. This promotes better healing. - 7Massage aloe vera into the scar to soften the tissue. Aloe vera has been shown to help reduce the appearance of burn scars, and you can safely try it to reduce the appearance of a keloid as well. [[6]](#_note-6)X Research source Topical Application of Aloe vera Accelerated Wound Healing, Modeling, and Remodeling: An Experimental Study With Significant Clinical Value. Aloe vera is an anti-inflammatory herb. The reduction of inflammation, especially during the early stages of scar formation may be important for increasing the elasticity of the new tissue. - 8Place green tea bags on the scar. Researchers believe that green tea may reduce scarring because of its antioxidant activity. [[7]](#_note-7)X Research source Sidgwick, G. P., McGeorge, D., & Bayat, A. (2015). A comprehensive evidence-based review on the role of topicals and dressings in the management of skin scarring. Archives Of Dermatological Research, 307(6), 461-477. Steep a bag of organic green tea in warm water. Use the tea bag directly on the scar three to four times a day for ten or fifteen minutes. - You can also soak a cotton towel in green tea, squeeze out the excess, and place over the scar three or four times a day for ten to fifteen minutes. - 9Try vitamins E and D. Both vitamins E and D have been used to improve the appearance of scars. [[8]](#_note-8)X Research source Martindale, D. (2000). Scar no more. Scientific American, 283(1), 34-36 For either option, open a liquid caplet of the vitamin, mix the contents with four to five drops of castor oil, and massage the liquid into the skin of the scar three to four times a day. - For vitamin E, use a liquid caplet containing 400 IU. - For vitamin D, use a liquid caplet that contains up to 2,000 IU. - 10Apply lavender oil. Lavender oil has traditional uses for helping to reduce scars. [[9]](#_note-9)X Research source WE ASKED. (2014). Massage Magazine, (213), 88-89. Mix two to three drops of lavender oil with two tablespoons of castor oil and massage the mix into your scar. Repeat three to four times each day. - 11Massage a mix of St. John's wort and castor oil into the scar. St. John's wort promotes wound healing and has especially been used to reduce scarring from C-sections. [[10]](#_note-10)X Research source Samadi, S., Khadivzadeh, A., Moosavi, N.

Mix two to three drops of the essential oil with two tablespoons of castor oil and massage the ointment into your scar. You can repeat this treatment three to four times daily. - 12Use apple cider vinegar to reduce redness. Apple cider vinegar (not white vinegar) is commonly recommended to help reduce redness associated with keloid scars. Consistent use may also help reduce the size of scars. Apply the vinegar directly to the scar and allow it to air dry. Rinse the area with warm water after five to ten minutes. You can repeat this process three to four times a day. - 13Apply honey to the scar. Honey is a natural moisturizer that has shown some promise in reducing the size of keloids. [[11]](#_note-11)X Research source Al-Waili, N., Salom, K., and Al-Ghamdi, A. A. Honey for wound healing, ulcers, and burns; data supporting its use in clinical practice. ScientificWorldJournal. 2011;11:766-787. Apply a thin layer of honey directly to the scar. Massage the honey into the scar for five minutes. Allow it to sit for an hour before rinsing off the honey. - Manuka honey or Tualang honey is generally recommended for medicinal use. - You can cover the honey with gauze to help prevent it from sticking to clothing. - 14Use Radix arnebiae. This herb has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for centuries to reduce scarring. Recent studies have indicated that it can reduce the numbers and functions of scar-forming cells. [[12]](#_note-12)X Research source Xie, Y., Fan, C., Dong, Y., Lynam, E., Leavesley, D. I., Li, K., & ... Upton, Z. (2015). Functional and mechanistic investigation of Shikonin in scarring. Chemico-Biological Interactions, 22818-27. To use the powder, mix half a teaspoon of the powder or one-quarter teaspoon of the concentrated herb with one to two tablespoons of castor oil. Massage the mixture into the scar tissue three to four times a day. - You may have to go to a local TCM practitioner in your area to find this herb. - 15Try a variety of methods. Many of these methods can take several months to produce a significant difference in reducing the appearance of your keloid scars. You can try using several of these methods at a time to help increase the chances of reducing your scar. - If you do prefer using the methods one at a time to determine which is most effective, then try the method for at least two to three weeks. If there is no change, move to another method or consider consulting your doctor about a medical procedure for removing your keloid. Seeing Your Doctor [Download Article](#) - 1Consult your doctor. If none of the natural methods help to reduce your keloid scar tissue, then the next step is to consult your doctor for a professional medical solution. - 2Ask about a corticosteroid injection. The most common solution for small and newer keloid scars is an injection of corticosteroids (intralesional triamcinolone acetonide), which reduce the synthesis of the keloid tissue. [[13]](#_note-13)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#)Your individual scar may react different to the treatment, but the average process requires three to four injections over the course of a month. [[14]](#_note-14)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#) - 3Ask about cryotherapy. Your doctor may suggest cryotherapy (freezing of the tissue) in conjunction with the injections. Cryotherapy damages the keloid tissue and helps lead to necrosis (death) of the keloid tissue to break it down faster than the corticosteroid injections alone. [[15]](#_note-15)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#)You can expect three to six sessions of cryotherapy for an average keloid scar. [[16]](#_note-16)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#) - A cryoneedle is a recent innovation to this technique that your doctor may suggest. This specialized needle allows your doctor to inject liquid nitrogen into the tissue as opposed to simply applying it to the top of the tissue. This can quicken the process. [[17]](#_note-17)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#) - A cryoneedle is a recent innovation to this technique that your doctor may suggest. This specialized needle allows your doctor to inject liquid nitrogen into the tissue as opposed to simply applying it to the top of the tissue. This can quicken the process. - 4Look into 5-FU treatment. Another option that is commonly used in association with corticosteroid injections is 5-FU, which is a drug that inhibits fibroblast cells (important cells in the process of healing wounded tissue) in such a way as to reduce keloids. [[18]](#_note-18)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#) - 5Ask about laser therapy options. Laser therapy options are becoming increasingly common in the treatment of keloid scars. The laser is used to break down the capillaries that feed the keloid tissue and to alter the production of collagen in the area around the tissue. [[19]](#_note-19)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#)Anywhere from two to six laser therapy treatments can vastly improve the color, height, and texture of a keloid scar. [[20]](#_note-20)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#) - 6Look into excision of the keloid. Depending on the height and area of the keloid, your doctor may also suggest excision (cutting away) of the tissue. This is usually only proposed for keloids more than one year old since the tissue can often flatten by itself over this time period. Excision of the keloid would result in a fresh wound that requires specific care to help avoid the potential for another keloid developing.
