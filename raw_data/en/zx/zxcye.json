And Why is It So Effective? If you are interested in recent discoveries in the areas of health and well-being, you may be wondering about holistic/spiritual healing and why it is so effective. To get a full understanding of what this topic, we'll start with the basics. What is Holistic Healing? The term \"holistic healing\" applies to a wide range of approaches that focus on healing the whole person. This is important, because we are more than physical bodies. The body, emotions, mind, and spirit are all connected, and they all play important parts in our health, happiness, and well-being. What is Spiritual Healing? The term \"spiritual healing\" applies to a wide range of practices that are designed to heal the whole person by focusing specifically on the human spirit. Like holistic healing, spiritual healing recognizes that every part of the person is connected. This highlights a profound point about the power of the human spirit. Spiritual healing can transform lives on all levels, including the body, emotions, mind, and spirit. This makes spiritual healing the deepest, most lasting, and most profound form of healing. Why to Use a Holistic/Spiritual Approach: With these three factors in mind, a holistic/spiritual approach to healing that also includes coaching makes a lot of sense. Anyone who wants to integrate deep, lasting changes into their daily lives can benefit in wonderful ways. What does \"holistic\" mean? Here is a dictionary definition of holistic: \"Relating to or concerned with integrated wholes or complete systems rather than with analyzing or treatment of separate parts\" [Scientist Albert Einstein](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1921/einstein/biographical/) discovered what metaphysicians knew for thousands of years: space and time are connected in what he called the space-time continuum. [Physicist David Bohm](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/david-bohm-quantum-mechanics-and-enlightenment/) took a further step to describe the bigger picture by saying that everything is part of a continuum. When we approach healing and life coaching holistically, we can experience for ourselves the way every part of us is connected. In fact, the part contains the whole. For example, there is DNA in each of our cells; every piece of a holographic film contains all the information to recall a whole memory. With a holistic/spiritual approach, life coaching and healing is more than a group of techniques. It reflects the truth -- that we are essentially spiritual beings having a human experience. Individuals' lives are often transformed when their situations are understood in relation to the whole person. And with life coaching, the whole person is seen in relation to the world in which he or she lives. What Holistic Life Coaches and Healers Do Holistic life coaches and healers using powerful techniques like EFT ( [Emotional Freedom Techniques](https://gettingthru.org/holistic/holistic-eft-emotional-freedom-techniques/)) and SK ( [Spiritual Kinesiology](https://gettingthru.org/holistic/faq-holistic-healing-techniques/spiritual-holistic-kinesiology-testing/)) draw on the holistic/spiritual model to support their clients in making powerful, lasting changes in all areas of their lives. Their work draws on the fact that any dysfunction related to a limiting belief, painful emotion, or physical ailment can be brought back into harmony with the whole. In relation to life coaching, this model demonstrates how everything that occurs in a person's life has meaning. A holistic/spiritual life coach and healer helps clients to identify the qualities and strategies that give life meaning and purpose going forward into the future. With the emergence of the Internet, holistic/spiritual healers and life coaches have a wealth of options. They can work with people anywhere in the world through internet video conferences, Skype, and other media. With a desire to keep it clear and simple, students in our holistic/spiritual life coaching and healing courses, which include EFT and more, appreciate the holistic/spiritual model for providing highly effective, lasting changes. Here's another key: a holistic approach draws on objective truths, so open-minded people from all walks of life can benefit. To provide a personal account, here's how Anna Easter, a founding professional member of IAHP, the International Association of Holistic Practitioners, describes her healing journey as a student with Awakenings Institute. \"There are no words for my gratitude for the gift of healing. I feel this is something we are all given but not all of us become aware of. \"I was blessed with divine intervention at a time when I was searching for something that I could do that would lift the energy of our planet - some way of helping out. It was synchronicity that brought me to a talk with Phillip Mountrose. \"Phillip and his wife Jane are the founders of the Awakenings Institute here on the central coast of California. I began taking classes from them and ended up with a private practice in Holistic/Spiritual Coaching and Healing in 2007. \"When we set our intentions into truly listening and caring for another human being, the healing that comes from it is healing for both of us. For me it has been a humbling experience for which I will always be grateful.\" As you can see from Anna's story, Awakenings Institute, the non-profit organization that created this website, also focuses on training holistic/spiritual life coaches and healers with big hearts. For us, holistic healing is more than a \"job.\" It's a mission that has the potential to transform the lives of all involved. The benefits clients and practitioners can receive from a holistic approach is a true blessing. In most cases, it is also non-invasive. From a medical perspective, this means it is free of introduction of instruments into the body. A holistic approach is also free of prescription medications, which can have dangerous affects on the body. Medications can also have a negative effect on an individual's emotional, mental, and spiritual well-being. Going beyond a traditional approach to life coaching and healing, a holistic approach can transform people's perspectives on who they are, along with their perceptions of what might be possible. It can help all of us to perceive ourselves in more expansive ways. In turn, we create increasingly more healthy, joyful, exciting, and fulfilling lives. The Spirit of a Holistic Approach From a spiritual perspective, understanding the way everything is connected also demonstrates how the entire journey to wholeness is built into us. Beyond lifestyle, we can witness our path to wholeness in the transformation of the mind, the heart, and the entire energy field that permeates our being. Every part of us - the body, emotions, mind, and experiences in life - provides pieces of the puzzle of who we are, why we are here, and where we are going. On the spiritual level, Wallace Wattles' teachings in The Science of Being Great provides a beautiful picture of who we are and why we are here. Life takes on new meaning when we realize, as Wattles suggests, that we are magnificent spiritual beings who are here to live fully and grow. From a spiritual perspective, we are also on a journey to wholeness. One of our graduates, Jen Peters, specializes in recovery from abuse. She described her personal journey this way: \"Each of us have walked our own unique path and have collected many layers of beliefs, patterns, emotional trauma and experiences that have shaped and led us to where we are today. \"For many, we're tired of repeating the same cycles and re-living the same trauma and experiences, but we don't always know how to step away from what we've always known and into a life of freedom and a life we love. \"For me, it took truly hitting rock bottom before I began working with a holistic practitioner. This was not only the turning point for me - I believe the decision to work with a holistic practitioner saved my life. \"Now a decade on, I am an Energy Healer specializing in Narcissistic Abuse Recovery, dissolving trapped emotional trauma. I also help my clients to dissolve the beliefs, patterns, and conditioning that keep people stuck in toxic cycles, so that they can move forward and create the lives they most want to live.\" The good news is that creating a bright future is a tremendous gift that's well worth pursuing. Simply focusing on the life you really want to live lifts your spirits and increases the capacity of both your mind and your heart. It connects the part you play to the whole of existence. You'll also find that it reduces confusion, anxiety and stress. This even increases longevity. Your Next Step Let your light shine even brighter! Phillip "}
