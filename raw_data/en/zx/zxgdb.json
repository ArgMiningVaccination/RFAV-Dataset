Lee works closely with program managers in the water resources application area. NASA is in the news most recently for interplanetary exploration with moon shots, stunning Mars landings, and a probe that recently left our solar system. But NASA mainly \"studies the most important planet we know of,\" says Lee, \"our own.\" Lee spoke by Skype on the ScienceNews Radio Network program Promise of Tomorrow with Colonel Mason from her home in Foggy Bottom near D.C., not able to work because of the recent government shutdown by republicans. On the program Lee described NASA's Capacity Building Program. The broadcast originates in Dallas, Texas, and can now be heard Webcast and archived for its world audience. A photo of Lee at work in the field in Kenya can be seen at a related story in the Examiner here. Lee received her Ph.D. (2010) in environmental engineering at UCLA, developing rapid methods for measuring microbial contamination in coastal urban watersheds. Her postdoctoral work at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory included studying microbial communities in extreme environments such as those in Mt. Kilimanjaro glaciers and in the Antarctic Dry Valley soil as part of an astrobiology lab. She has conducted fieldwork in Southern California as well as Bangladesh, Tanzania, Mexico, and Antarctica. The third annual IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference (GHTC) is October 21- 23in Silicon Valley. Registration has been ongoing for several weeks. For five years Lee was an active participant and student leader in Engineers without Borders, also a partner with IEEE at this event, during which she founded a computer refurbishing and education program for local high schools and had the opportunity to travel to Guatemala to set up a computer lab in a community center. Lee received a Switzer Foundation Environmental Leadership Fellowship in 2008-09 and co-authored a funded proposal for the EPA People, Planet, and Prosperity Student Design Competition in 2009-10.

River blindness, or onchocerciasis (pronounced on-cho-sir-sy-ah-sis) has been largely neglected because it has no cure while afflicting a million people in Africa. Black fly bites carry the microbe that forms itchy worms in the human skin and results in blindness after years of suffering. The new test has been developed by PATH of Seattle, WA. It will be manufactured and distributed by Standard Diagnostics. Drugs produced by Merck can kill the enfant worms in early detection, but only control adult worms that live for up to 15 years. Those afflicted must know when it is safe to stop the treatments. This new diagnostic field test uses only one drop of blood and will \"monitor the transmission of the disease,\" says Tala de los Santos, group leader for diagnostics at PATH. \"The test can help provide the evidence\" for when the drug administration can be safely stopped\" in already afflicted victims. Speaking by phone from her office in Seattle, de los Santos made her report today on the ScienceNews Radio Network program [Promise of Tomorrow with Colonel Mason](http://www.promiseoftomorrow.biz/). The program originates in Dallas, Texas, and can now be heard Webcast and archived for its world audience. A photo of de los Santos working in her lab can be seen at a related story in the [Examiner](http://www.examiner.com/article/river-blindness-breakthrough). PATH is an international nonprofit organization that works in more than 70 countries delivering lifesaving vaccines, drugs, diagnostics, and devices in collaborative programs with communities. This is the first time PATH has been featured at the cross-discipline conference on the world's urgent human necessities. IEEE's GHTC will be held October 20 - 23, 2013 in Silicon Valley, San Jose Airport Garden Hotel, California, the third annual.

A brilliant young Australian, Snoad is Product Manager, Crisis Response and Civic Innovation at Google; also a core team member at Random Hacks of Kindness. Snoad believes that through everyday tools like Twitter, Google searches, open data, Smart Search, etc., current methods of crisis response will change for the better. \"Citizens are being empowered with the information so they can look after themselves and protect their families and neighborhoods, and work with each other,\" said Snoad, speaking by phone from his office in New York City on the ScienceNews Radio Network program [Promise of Tomorrow with Colonel Mason](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0018Y2sRbaaVSIspnCHgGq4nj4aX6uVXNsM3dq2ZNcv8xLFvZFqhw5QI2T3mQmwA03mRknLkJCUizJDcfl-Mn2m5wDj0FCwbZ5H1yx59zui7aSAjo4H9sezd164Gq4RJ2vT). The program originates in Dallas, Texas, and can now be heard Webcast and archived for its world audience. On the program Mason asked Snoad if there was rather a real danger from social media in the spreading of dangerous misleading information. \"Error correction and rumor correction tends to travel faster than the bad information,\" answered Snoad, \"there's a pile of research on this.\" Snoad went on to predict a future dramatically different from today's reliance only on government solutions. \"The more that we can do to enable citizens to work together, to understand what's happening around them, communicate, listen to the authorities-the better off they're going to be and the stronger our communities and neighborhoods are going to be,\" said Snoad, \"that's an awesome thing.\" A photo of Snoad can be seen at a related story in the [Examiner](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0018Y2sRbaaVSILpE0Syw6NA9e74kV7ayYTcGoKc5GRodVjssCIriQcvSs1XBevTjksuMOzB4mMQMgDXT0xNzVF-bCa6mVlZ1PfO1pPTB2h_UyheWb-gD8XLjgY90eG-G56hYROQCJxvHvIbXMUMA6KhDOz-duk_tgdW411CHqRoeYrCzYuiFzJ5Q_nQOcPAAEr).

That and other fantastic life advances will be featured at the influential IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology conference (GHTC) in Silicon Valley this fall. The science fiction type quality of our diagnostic tools is being built into our mobile phones. \"The cellphone itself is an amazing platform,\" says Aydogan Ozcan, leading the Bio and Nano Photonics laboratory at UCLA. Dr. Ozcan will make his presentations as keynote speaker at the IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference 2013, October 20-23, at the San Jose Airport Garden Hotel, California. \"The optical components on the cellphone are very advanced, doubling in megapixels every two years,\" says Ozcan. We \"can easily convert (them) into advanced microscopy or diagnostic tools. Bench top versions of the same technology are expensive and bulky.\" The same tests can now be done in the field which make these cellphone devices ideal for remote areas of the world. Ozcan spoke by phone from his office at UCLA on the ScienceNews Radio Network program, the [Promise of Tomorrow with Colonel Mason](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0018yTB-U9AnoF5UnvNl4hHXJxhZiRrkdzXK-vkHa1O25-nnnyKFXdOTVuu9To9CW8-DglrwxOPI8TODp7NI7yhlQh0DJT1QeKmXgMAJKFQowN4HlxE40hvxWs5kl59LYmJ). The program originates in Dallas, Texas, and is now archived and Webcast for its world audience. On the program Mason asked Ozcan if he sees a time when the molecules of diseases will be manipulated at the atomic level to make them harmless. \"That is the holy grail of telemedicine,\" answered Ozcan, \"I think that is the revolution we are going to see.\" And Ozcan even predicts a time frame. \"This next decade will be quite fascinating,\" he says, \"we are going to increase our lifespan to routinely 100s in the next decade or so.\" Ozcan points out that everybody caries a cellphone so health management of an aging population will be extremely important. And Ozcan says this will dramatically cut medical expenses because prevention is so much less costly than treating chronic illness.
