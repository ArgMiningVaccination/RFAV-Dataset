In contrast to the closely related opportunistic pathogen Neisseria meningitidis, there is an absence of adaptive cell-mediated immunity to N. lactamica during the peak age of carriage. Instead, outer membrane vesicles derived from N. lactamica mediate a B cell-dependent proliferative response in mucosal mononuclear cells that is associated with the production of polyclonal IgM. We demonstrate in this study that this is a mitogenic human B cell response that occurs independently of T cell help and any other accessory cell population. The ability to drive B cell proliferation is a highly conserved property and is present in N. lactamica strains derived from diverse clonal complexes. CFSE staining of purified human tonsillar B cells demonstrated that naive IgD+ and CD27 B cells are selectively induced to proliferate by outer membrane vesicles, including the innate CD5+ subset. Neither purified lipooligosaccharide nor PorB from N. lactamica is likely to be responsible for this activity. Prior treatment of B cells with pronase to remove cell-surface Ig or treatment with BCR-specific Abs abrogated the proliferative response to N. lactamica outer membrane vesicles, suggesting that this mitogenic response is dependent upon the BCR. The majority of mammalian mucosal epithelia are inhabited by a normal bacterial flora that colonizes soon after birth and is present throughout the lifetime of the host ( [1](javascript:;), [2](javascript:;)). This commensal population has coevolved with the host immune system, resulting in the development of multiple mechanisms by which it evades, modulates, or inhibits the immune response to escape clearance ( [3](javascript:;)). The majority of mechanisms identified so far have come from the investigation of host-commensal interactions in the mouse intestine. These include suppression of inflammation by the commensal flora via the inhibition of NF-B activation in epithelial cells ( [4](javascript:;)), induction of peripheral tolerance ( [5](javascript:;)), including the induction of regulatory T cells ( [6](javascript:;)), and the production of T cell-independent intestinal IgA by B1 B cells ( [7](javascript:;)). Commensal colonizers at other mucosal sites, such as the upper respiratory tract (URT), have also evolved mechanisms to circumvent clearance by the host immune system ( [8](javascript:;), [9](javascript:;)). The genus Neisseria is a group of Gram-negative, mostly diplococcus bacteria, the majority of which are obligate colonizers of the human URT ( [10](javascript:;)). N. meningitidis is an opportunistic pathogen that normally establishes a commensal relationship with the host, but infrequently causes invasive disease, resulting in septicemia and/or meningitis ( [11](javascript:;)). N. lactamica is a closely related commensal that has only caused disease in exceptional circumstances ( [12](javascript:;), [13](javascript:;)). Carriage studies have revealed that individual strains of N. meningitidis and N. lactamica can colonize the host for months at a time ( [14](javascript:;)) without causing immunopathology. In previous investigations, we have demonstrated that N. meningitidis and N. lactamica interact with the mucosal immune system in very different ways ( [9](javascript:;), [15](javascript:;)). N. meningitidis primes an adaptive immune response rapidly upon the onset of carriage ( [16](javascript:;)), generating both T cell ( [15](javascript:;)) and B cell ( [9](javascript:;)) memory in the local mucosa. Carriage of N. meningitidis is also associated with mucosal regulatory T cell activity, which may prevent immunopathology and promote continued carriage ( [8](javascript:;)). Conversely, although carriage of N. lactamica has been associated with increased titers of antimeningococcal Ig in the periphery during the peak period of nasopharyngeal carriage ( [17](javascript:;)), N. lactamica appears to evade the adaptive immune system in the URT mucosa, failing to prime the development of immunological memory ( [9](javascript:;)). T cell responses only become detectable to N. lactamica Ags in older individuals, presumably as a result of cross-reactivity with N. meningitidis proteins or to other commensal Neisseria species to which they develop memory following carriage ( [9](javascript:;)). Although N. lactamica evades priming immunological memory, we have also shown that outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) prepared from this bacteria stimulate a potent proliferative response in tonsillar mononuclear cell (TMNC) cultures from young children and adults that is absent in response to N. meningitidis. This proliferative response is dependent upon the presence of CD19+ B cells and is associated with the production of T cell-independent polyclonal IgM that resembles natural Ab. The production of natural Ab may be one mechanism by which N. lactamica maintains immunological ignorance in the host, shielding it from the adaptive immune system, promoting continued carriage ( [9](javascript:;)). In addition, due to its polyclonal reactivity, this Ig may cross-react with colonizing N. meningitidis on the nasopharyngeal epithelium and thus offer some protection against invasive meningococcal disease. As in the gastrointestinal tract ( [18](javascript:;)), induction of natural Ab production may be an important mechanism of immune evasion by the commensal flora in the URT. The mechanism by which N. lactamica OMVs stimulate T cell-independent polyclonal Ig production in TMNCs is not yet understood. Inducers of polyclonal B cell proliferation are widespread in nature and have been identified in bacteria ( [19](javascript:;)), viruses ( [22](javascript:;)). Their mechanisms of action are varied, stimulating B cells via pattern recognition receptors, such as the TLRs ( [23](javascript:;)) or C-type lectin ( [24](javascript:;)) receptors in case of T-independent type 1 Ags, via the BCR in the case of B cell superantigens ( [25](javascript:;)), or via nonspecific B cell uptake, processing, and subsequent MHC-dependent presentation to cognate T cells in the case of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ( [26](javascript:;)). Induction of microbial colonizers and the hypergammaglobulinemia that ensues is most often associated with pathology in the host, including immunosuppression ( [27](javascript:;)) and autoimmunity ( [28](javascript:;)). Although the role of this response is still debated, it is widely believed that the induction of polyclonal B cell proliferation can be a strategy used by pathogens to evade specific immune effector mechanisms ( [29](javascript:;), [30](javascript:;)). In this study, we demonstrate that human B cell proliferation induced by N. lactamica Ags occurs independently of T cell help or any other accessory cell population within the mucosal lymphoid tissue. Furthermore, N. lactamica OMVs selectively induce only naive B cell subsets to proliferate, which includes CD5+ B1 B cells, the cells responsible for natural Ab production. Neither lipooligosaccharide (LOS) nor the outer membrane protein PorB are likely to be responsible for this effect. We show that this B cell proliferative response and Ab production is dependent upon the presence of a protein with properties of a B cell superantigen, possibly mediating its function via the BCR. This may be a common mechanism that has evolved in the commensal flora of the gastrointestinal tract and URT to selectively induce only the innate arm of the humoral immune system while leaving the adaptive arm unprimed. Materials and Methods Human subjects Palatine tonsils (PTs) were collected from individuals undergoing routine tonsillectomy for recurrent tonsillitis, hypertrophy, and sleep apnea. Immunodeficient patients or those that had previously been diagnosed with invasive meningococcal disease were excluded from this investigation. Although our observations are limited by the use of tonsillar tissue obtained from patients with tonsillar disease, the tonsils were not removed during periods of active inflammation. In addition, immunohistochemical analyses have not revealed marked neutrophil infiltration or areas of necrosis in the excised tissue ( [8](javascript:;), [15](javascript:;)), which appears to be immunologically responsive to experimental stimuli. Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals. All tonsils were used within 24 h of removal. A total of 50-100 ml blood was obtained from healthy adults by venepuncture. Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals in compliance with relevant guidelines and institutional practices. Blood was stored at room temperature for a maximum of 1 h before use. The collection of samples and the research described complies with relevant guidelines and institutional practices (Central and South Bristol Research Ethics Committee, E4388.) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham, U.K.). Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I strain, proteinase K, and RNase A were purchased from Merck Chemicals (Beeston, U.K.). CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) type B, 2006, was obtained from Autogen Bioclear (Nottingham, U.K.). OMV production clonal 640) were prepared from late log-phase cultures under iron-limited growth using a sodium-deoxycholate detergent extraction method as described previously ( [31](javascript:;)). Strains 002-24, 004-12, 005-12, and 020-06 were provided by Dr. Julia Bennett (University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K.). OMVs of N. meningitidis (strain H44/76, B: P1.7, 16; 9, ST-32) were prepared by Dr. Jamie Findlow (Health Protection Agency North West, Manchester, U.K.) using the same method ( [31](javascript:;)). Purification of native N. lactamica porin, PorB Purification of LOS LOS from N. lactamica was purified from whole cells using an improved phenol-water extraction method followed by gel filtration using fast performance liquid chromatography as already described ( [34](javascript:;)). Briefly, 5 g (wet weight) bacterial cells was resuspended in extraction buffer [sodium phosphate (pH 7) and 5 mM EDTA] to a volume of 10 ml and treated with lysozyme (10 mg/ml), DNase I (0.1 mg/ml), and RNase A (0.1 mg/ml). LOS was extracted with 10 ml 45% phenol, precipitated overnight in two volumes of 70% ethanol containing 0.25 M NaCl, and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 \u00d7 g. The LOS was resuspended in 5 ml extraction buffer and treated with RNase A (50 g/ml) and proteinase K (0.2 mg/ml) prior to a second round of precipitation and centrifugation. The LOS was resuspended in 9.5 ml 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 2 mM EDTA, and 1% sodium deoxycholate (w/v) followed by the addition of 0.5 ml 20% sodium deoxycholate (w/v) and further purified on a Sephacryl S-300 column (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, U.K.). The main LOS fractions were pooled and precipitated, and the purified LOS was resuspended in water for long-term storage at 20\u00b0C. KDO assay The KDO content of the purified LOS was quantified using the improved KDO microassay developed by Karkhanis et al. ( [35](javascript:;)) after modification for use in a 96-well microtiter plate. As the molecular structure of N. lactamica LOS has not yet been elucidated. it is not possible to convert the known KDO content into an absolute m.w. of LOS. However, Gu et al. ( [34](javascript:;)) measured the KDO content in known amounts of LOS from a range of meningococcal strains and found the mean content to be 39 g KDO/mg LOS. N. lactamica LOS shares homologous epitopes with N. meningitidis LOS ( [36](javascript:;)), which we assume are structurally similar. We have therefore used Gu et al's data ( [34](javascript:;)) to estimate the absolute concentration of purified N. lactamica LOS from the known KDO content. Isolation and purification of mononuclear cells Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated from PTs and peripheral blood using a previously described method ( [8](javascript:;), [15](javascript:;)) and resuspended in Paisley, U.K.) supplemented 0.1 mg/ml and 1% (v/v) heat-inactivated human AB serum (National Blood Service, Bristol, U.K.). B cells were negatively enriched from PBMCs by an immunorosetting technique using the Human B Cell Enrichment mixture according to the manufacturer's instructions (RosetteSep, StemCell Technologies, London, U.K.). This technique was not applicable for use in TMNCs, from which B cells were purified by negative depletion using the B Cell Isolation Kit II according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Bisley, U.K.). The purity of separations was verified by flow cytometry. [3H]Thymidine deoxyribose incorporation assay Cellular proliferation was measured in MNCs using a previously described method ( [9](javascript:;), [15](javascript:;)). Cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a atmosphere of 5% CO2 at either 0.6 \u00d7 106/ml or 1 \u00d7 106/ml in complete cell culture medium with no Ag, N. meningitidis OMVs (1 g/ml protein), N. g/ml), PWM LOS, or PorB. Cells were seeded into 24-well flat-bottom plates at a final volume of 2 ml. On days 2-9, 100 l cells were plated in triplicate wells in a 96-well tissue culture plate and pulsed with 0.4 Ci [3H]thymidine deoxyribose (TdR) (GE Healthcare), and 24 h later, incorporation was quantified. Proliferation was calculated as mean corrected cpm (CCPM) of each triplicate. CFSE labeling of TMNCs To identify proliferating cell subsets in response to antigenic challenge, 5 \u00d7 107 TMNCs or purified tonsillar B cells/ml were stained with 3.59 M CFSE in PBS for 8 min at 37\u00b0C. The reaction was quenched by washing the cells with ice-cold PBS followed by centrifugation at 600 \u00d7 g. The cells were resuspended in complete cell culture medium and seeded into 24-well flat-bottom plates at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml. The final volume was 2 ml cell suspension/well. TMNCs were then cultured at 37\u00b0C for 6 d in 5% CO2 in cell culture medium alone or with N. lactamica OMVs (1 g/ml protein). On day 6, the cells were stained and fixed for flow cytometric analysis. Abs and flow cytometry The anti-mouse IgG was purchased from AbD Serotec (Oxford, U.K.). Analytical flow cytometry was performed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). CellQuest software (BD Biosciences) was employed for data acquisition, and the data were analyzed using FlowJo software for Windows (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Phenotypic acquisition was performed as previously described ( [9](javascript:;), [15](javascript:;)). Enzymatic digestion of N. lactamica OMVs A total of 1 mg (total protein) OMV was used for all digestions. For protein digestion, 20 g proteinase K in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) with 1 mM CaCl was added to OMVs at a final volume of 200 l and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonylfluoride, hydrochloride (Merck Chemicals) to a final concentration of 1 M. For DNA digestion, 10 U DNase I in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) with 2 mM MgCl2 was added to OMVs at a final volume of 200 l and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 50 mM EDTA. For RNA digestion, 2 g RNase A in water was added to OMVs at a final volume of 200 l and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 88 U RNase inhibitor in 50% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 50 mM KCl, and 8 mM DTT. OMVs treated concurrently with enzyme and stopping agent as above were prepared as controls. OMV components were separated by SDS-PAGE as previously described ( [37](javascript:;)). Gels were silver stained using the SilverQuest silver staining kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Enzymatic removal of surface Ig from tonsillar B cells Surface Ig was cleaved from the surface of tonsillar B cells using pronase as previously described ( [38](javascript:;)). Briefly, 6 \u00d7 with 1.5 mg/ml pronase at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. The cells were then washed three times in cell culture medium. The absence of surface Ig postdigestion was confirmed by flow cytometry. Polyclonal anti-IgM and anti-IgD treatment of tonsillar B cells To attempt to specifically prevent ligand interaction with cell surface IgM and IgD, tonsillar B cells were treated with polyclonal goat anti- (500 g/ml) and anti- Abs (500 or polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG (1 mg/ml) as an isotype control. A total of 6 \u00d7 107 TMNC/ml in HBSS was incubated with the Abs at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. The cells were then washed three times in cell culture medium. Statistical analysis Data were assessed for conformation to a Gaussian distribution by employing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test using GraphPad Prism version 4.02 for Windows (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Parametric data were analyzed using the paired Student t test for paired samples. Nonparametric data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test for paired samples. All data were analyzed using two-tailed hypotheses. Results N. lactamica OMVs but not N. meningitidis OMVs induce a potent proliferative response in human tonsillar B cells that is independent of T cell help OMVs have been used extensively by us ( [8](javascript:;), [9](javascript:;), [15](javascript:;)) and others ( [39](javascript:;), [40](javascript:;)) for the investigation of immune responses to Neisseria species because they contain a sample of the bacterial outer membrane proteins embedded in a phospholipid vesicle, together with LOS. OMVs have been observed in the plasma of infected individuals during active meningococcal disease ( [41](javascript:;)), and it is widely believed that they are produced in vivo during asymptomatic colonization of the nasopharynx by N. lactamica and N. meningitidis, functioning in host interaction ( [42](javascript:;)). In addition, whole bacterial preparations contain cytoplasmic and nuclear immune modulators that may not be available to the host immune system during colonization. For these reasons, we have used OMVs in this investigation as a representative tool for studying the interaction that occurs between asymptomatically colonizing N. lactamica and N. meningitidis and the mucosal immune system of the human URT. We have previously shown that OMVs from N. lactamica (Y92-1009) but not from N. meningitidis (H44/76) induce a potent proliferative response in TMNCs that peaks early at day 2 or 3 of culture ( [9](javascript:;)). The early peak of this response is characteristic of noncognate mitogenic proliferation in either the B cell ( [43](javascript:;)) or T cell ( [44](javascript:;)) population. Due to the diverse number of bacterial components that are known to induce polyclonal B cell proliferation ( [30](javascript:;)) and our previous observation that the N. lactamica-induced proliferative response is B cell dependent ( [9](javascript:;)), we speculated that N. lactamica OMVs induce B cells to divide. Analysis of CFSE-labeled TMNCs by flow cytometry confirmed this, demonstrating that the majority of the cells that became CFSE low in cultures stimulated with N. lactamica OMVs express B cell marker, CD19 ( [Fig. 1](javascript:;)). [Close modal](javascript:;) To determine whether the early B cell response to N. lactamica OMVs was independent of T cell help and therefore truly mitogenic, we purified the B cell population from TMNC by negative selection ( [Fig. 2A](javascript:;)). The peak and N. meningitidis OMVs was collated on days 2 to 3 prior to and after B cell enrichment from individuals over a broad age range (3-18 y, median 6.5 y) ( [Fig. 2B](javascript:;)). The proliferative response to N. lactamica OMVs was maintained after B cell enrichment (mean 35,576 CCPM) with no significant difference to the response in whole TMNCs (mean 38,378 CCPM), indicating that it occurs independently of T cell help and other accessory cell populations within the PT. In contrast, there was a significant decrease in the low level proliferative response to N. meningitidis OMVs at this early time point after B cell enrichment (mean 465 CCPM; p < 0.05) compared with whole TMNCs (mean 3102 CCPM), indicative of an early T cell rather than a B cell response as demonstrated previously ( [15](javascript:;)). These results demonstrate that N. lactamica OMVs stimulate a mitogenic B cell response that is independent of cognate interaction with T cells. This is characteristic of proliferation induced by the T-independent type 1 Ags, CpG ODN ( [45](javascript:;)) [Close modal](javascript:;) of the mitogenic response to N. lactamica OMVs is highly variable between subjects ( [Fig. 2B](javascript:;)). The reason for this variation is unknown, but there is no relationship between magnitude of the response and age of the individual at the time of tonsillectomy ( [9](javascript:;)). Instead, genetic and environmental differences between subjects may be the cause. The mitogenic response to N. lactamica OMVs is induced by multiple divergent strains of N. lactamica To determine that the mitogenic response to N. lactamica OMVs was not restricted to the single N. lactamica laboratory strain Y92-1009, an additional four strains from different clonal complexes (see [1Materials and Methods](#s1)) were selected from the pubMLST database (http://pubmlst.org) and used to generate OMVs. OMVs from all strains induced the early proliferative kinetic that is characteristic of strain Y92-1009, which is absent in response to N. meningitidis OMVs ( [Fig. 3A](javascript:;)). These results demonstrate that the ability to induce polyclonal B cell proliferation is a highly conserved property in N. lactamica. Interestingly, the magnitude of the response varied between strains even though the same concentration of protein was used in each culture. SDS-PAGE of the OMVs demonstrated that although many protein bands appeared to be shared across all strains, the intensity of the bands varied ( [Fig. 3B](javascript:;)). This suggests that the expression of individual outer membrane components differs between strains of N. lactamica and may explain why the magnitude of the proliferative response was also variable. [Close modal](javascript:;) The mitogenic response to N. lactamica OMVs is present in B cells derived from human peripheral blood We investigated whether the mitogenic response to N. lactamica OMVs was present in all B cells or whether it was confined to mucosal B cells of the human URT. Initial experiments measuring the proliferative response of PBMCs from adults showed that the early peak in proliferation was absent in response to N. lactamica OMVs and that only later peaks characteristic of cognate T cell proliferation were present ( [Fig. 4A](javascript:;)). However, the proportion of B cells in PBMCs ( [47](javascript:;)) is much smaller than in TMNCs ( [15](javascript:;)), and it was considered possible that the sensitivity of the assay was too low to detect the smaller population of B cells proliferating at days 2 to 3. Therefore, B cells were enriched by negative selection and the experiments repeated. The proportion of CD19+ cells present in PBMC prior to enrichment was generally <5% (median 3.2%) and was substantially increased postenrichment (median 48.6%) as assessed by flow cytometry. These further experiments showed that the peak proliferative response between day 2 and 3 to N. lactamica OMVs (Y92-1009) significantly increased (p < 0.05) after B cell enrichment (mean 31,995 CCPM) compared with whole PBMCs (mean 3811 CCPM) ( [Fig. 4B](javascript:;)). The magnitude of the response comparable to that observed in TMNCs ( [Fig. 2](javascript:;)), suggesting that it is not restricted to mucosal B cells. As expected, the proliferative response to N. meningitidis OMVs remained low after B cell enrichment (mean 1975 CCPM), and there was no significant difference to whole PBMCs (mean 1353 CCPM). [Close modal](javascript:;) Naive (IgD+ and CD27), including B1 B cells proliferate in response to N. lactamica OMVs We have previously demonstrated that N. lactamica OMVs induce the production of polyclonal IgM in enriched tonsillar B cell populations in the absence of T cells ( [9](javascript:;)). We speculated that this was natural Ab and may be involved in maintaining immunological ignorance to colonizing N. lactamica in the URT in early childhood ( [9](javascript:;)). We therefore further phenotyped the B cell population upon stimulation with N. lactamica OMVs to determine if B1 B cells [which are responsible for natural Ab production ( [48](javascript:;))] were proliferating and whether all B cell subsets are equally responsive. Purified tonsillar B cells were stained with CFSE on day 0 and cultured in the presence of medium only or N. lactamica OMVs (Y92-1009) for 6 d, before the was used to differentiate between naive and memory B cells. The majority of the CFSE low, proliferating B cells in cultures with N. lactamica OMVs were IgD+ and CD27, which, assuming that expression of IgD and CD27 is unlikely to have changed dramatically in our cultures, suggests that the mitogenic response was primarily mediated by naive B cells. Staining with anti-CD5 ( [Fig. 5C](javascript:;)) demonstrated that, as expected, B1 (CD5+) B cells were proliferating in response to N. lactamica OMVs. However, CD5 B cells also responded. In the PTs, this CD5 population includes the tonsillar equivalent of marginal zone B cells ( [49](javascript:;)) and conventional follicular (B2) B cells ( [50](javascript:;)). [Close modal](javascript:;) LOS and PorB are unlikely to be responsible for the mitogenic response to N. lactamica OMVs There are several molecular candidates within the outer membrane of N. lactamica that may be responsible for inducing polyclonal B cell proliferation. Meningococcal LOS ( meningitidis porin protein, ( have both been demonstrated to be mitogenic in murine B cell populations. In addition, N. meningitidis PorB is mitogenic for human B cells, but only by a zwitterionic detergent ( [52](javascript:;)). N. stimulates proliferation of murine B cells ( [33](javascript:;)), but its effect on human B cells has not been investigated and may be mitogenic in the native conformation. Human B cells do not proliferate to endotoxin from Escherichia coli ( [53](javascript:;)), but the response to N. meningitidis and N. lactamica LOS is unknown. Thus, we decided to examine the proliferative response of human B cells to both purified LOS and PorB from N. lactamica (Y92-1009). [Fig. 6](javascript:;) shows the peak proliferative response of TMNCs cultured in the presence of either N. lactamica OMVs (Y92-1009), various concentrations of LOS, or PorB, as indicated. Purified LOS failed to induce a proliferative response over a range of concentrations (mean <3000 CCPM) ( [Fig. 6A](javascript:;)). Although it is not possible to extrapolate the absolute concentration of LOS that was added to cultures from the quantified KDO content, by adopting the approximate value of 39 g KDO/mg LOS (see [1Materials and Methods](#s1)), we estimate that the concentration of LOS ranged from 0.026-2.6 g/ml. This broadly encompasses the range of LOS present in OMV, which is 0.05-0.8 g LOS/g protein ( [54](javascript:;)). In addition, the purified LOS stimulated a potent proliferative response in murine splenocytes at the concentrations used in [Fig. 6](javascript:;), demonstrating that it was biologically active (data not shown). Purified porin protein embedded within a protein micelle also failed to induce a proliferative response in human TMNCs (median 0 CCPM) over a range of concentrations that have been shown to be mitogenic in murine B cells ( [33](javascript:;)) ( [Fig. 6B](javascript:;)). This was not due to toxicity of the porin because potent proliferative responses were measured in TMNCs stimulated with both N. lactamica OMVs and porin protein mixed together (data not shown). Our collaborators have previously demonstrated the activity of purified porin protein from N. lactamica ( [33](javascript:;)) and have extensive experience in producing highly purified Neisserial porin proteins that are correctly refolded into the native conformation ( [32](javascript:;)). Thus, although we have not confirmed the biological activity of the porin preparation used in this study, we have no reason to suspect that it is biologically inactive. As expected, all individuals displayed a potent proliferative response to whole OMVs. These data demonstrate that N. lactamica LOS and porin protein are unlikely to be responsible for the mitogenic effect of N. lactamica OMVs in human B cells. [Close modal](javascript:;) To further determine the molecular nature of the mitogen, separate experiments were carried out in which we enzymatically digested N. lactamica OMV (004-12) with DNase (to eliminate CpG ODN contamination), RNase, or protease and cultured the digested product with TMNCs at a concentration that was equivalent to a protein concentration of 1 g/ml undigested OMV. OMVs that had been treated with enzyme in the presence of the stopping reagent were included as a control ( [Fig. 7](javascript:;)). Digestion with DNase or RNase suggesting component of OMV is not a nucleic acid. Conversely, treatment with protease completely abrogated the proliferative response ( [Fig. 7C](javascript:;)), indicating that the mitogenic component of OMV is likely to be a protein. SDS-PAGE of the OMVs prior to and after protease digestion demonstrated that most of the protein had been completely digested by the treatment, leaving the characteristic low m.w. band of LOS at the bottom of the gel ( [Fig. 7D](javascript:;)). [Close modal](javascript:;) Removal of the BCR B cells or treatment with polyclonal anti-BCR Abs abrogates the proliferative response to N. lactamica OMVs To further characterize the polyclonal B cell response to N. lactamica OMVs, we attempted to identify the pathway by which it induces B cells to proliferate. The main mechanisms of inducing polyclonal B cell proliferation independently of T cell involvement that have been identified are via binding to TLR ( [23](javascript:;)), binding to C-type lectin cross-linking of surface Ig ( [25](javascript:;)). To determine if the response was dependent upon the expression of surface Ig, we treated TMNCs with pronase, which has been shown to cleave Ig from the surface of human ( [55](javascript:;)), and murine ( [38](javascript:;)) B cells. Murine B cells continue to proliferate in response to E. coli LPS (a TLR4 ligand) after pronase digestion ( [38](javascript:;)), demonstrating that cell-surface TLRs remain intact. Human TMNCs were cultured in the presence of PWM and N. lactamica OMVs prior to and posttreatment with pronase. The lectin PWM does not require cell-surface Ig to stimulate polyclonal proliferation of B cells ( [56](javascript:;)) and was included as a control instead of LPS because human B cells do not proliferate to LPS. Proliferation was measured on day 2, and the response of pronase-treated cells was plotted as a percentage of the response obtained in untreated cells ( [Fig. 8A](javascript:;)). Pronase treatment almost completely to N. lactamica OMVs (median 5.0% of untreated cells), suggesting that it may be mediated via the BCR. In contrast, the proliferative response to PWM was only partially inhibited after pronase digestion (median 69.1% of untreated cells) consistent with PWM stimulation being independent of BCR engagement, but indicative of a partial inhibitory effect of pronase digestion. The median magnitude of proliferation to each mitogen prior to pronase digestion B cell response to N. lactamica OMVs was dependent on BCR engagement, TMNCs were treated with polyclonal anti-BCR Abs. As primarily naive B cells proliferate in response to N. lactamica OMVs ( [Fig. 5](javascript:;)), TMNCs were treated with anti- or anti- Abs or with both Abs at the same time to attempt to prevent ligand binding to cell-surface IgM and IgD, respectively. TMNCs were cultured in the presence of PWM, CpG ODN, or N. lactamica OMVs prior to and posttreatment with the Abs. Proliferation was measured on day 2, and the response was plotted as a percentage of that obtained in untreated cells ( [Fig. 8B](javascript:;)). Proliferation in response to N. lactamica OMVs was partially abrogated by treatment with anti- (mean 39.6% of untreated cells), whereas anti- had a greater effect (mean 14.40% of untreated cells). Treatment with both Abs together had an additive effect and almost completely abrogated the proliferative response to N. lactamica OMVs (mean 9.8% of untreated cells). Ab treatment alone did not increase proliferation of TMNCs (data not shown). These results suggest that the BCR is important for N. lactamica OMVs to induce polyclonal B cell proliferation and that the mitogenic response may be mediated through engagement of cell-surface IgM and IgD. As expected, treatment with BCR-specific Abs had little effect on the proliferative response to PWM or CpG ODN, which was similar to the level observed in untreated cells ( [Fig. 8B](javascript:;)). This indicates that the inhibitory effect of anti-BCR treatment was specific to N. lactamica OMVs and not due to a generalized inhibition of B cell proliferation. In addition, maintenance of the proliferative response to N. lactamica OMVs in cells treated with an isotype control Ab demonstrate that abrogation of the response with anti-BCR Abs is due to the specificity of the binding and not a nonspecific effect caused by the high concentrations of Ab used ( [Fig. 8C](javascript:;)). These data indicate that the B cell mitogen within the outer membrane of N. lactamica may be a B cell superantigen. Discussion N. meningitidis and N. lactamica are closely related bacterial colonizers of the human URT. Although both species typically colonize for prolonged periods of time, they interact with the mucosal immune system in very different ways ( [8](javascript:;), [9](javascript:;), [15](javascript:;)). Unlike N. meningitidis, a potent proliferative response in tonsillar B cells that is a highly conserved property present in multiple divergent strains of N. lactamica from different clonal complexes. The response is almost exclusively restricted to the naive B cell pool, including CD5+ cells, and is independent of cognate T cell interaction. TMNCs fail to proliferate to either LOS or PorB proteosomes prepared from N. lactamica, indicating that they are not the molecular components responsible for inducing this mitogenic activity. Loss of proliferation after protease digestion demonstrates that the mitogenic component of N. lactamica OMV is probably a protein, but with >180 potential proteins contained in N. lactamica OMV, of which up to 111 may be distinct from N. meningitidis OMV ( [57](javascript:;)), the list of candidates is large. There are several mechanisms by which inducers of polyclonal B cell proliferation activate B cells. B cell superantigens function by binding to a conserved motif outside the CDR on the Fab component of the BCR, resulting in cross-linking of the receptor and activation of the B cell ( [25](javascript:;)). As also observed with N. lactamica OMVs, B cell superantigens preferentially target naive B cells to proliferate ( [19](javascript:;), [25](javascript:;)), possibly due to an increased affinity to IgM than IgG ( [20](javascript:;)). We speculated whether N. lactamica OMVs may also contain a B cell superantigen that binds to IgM or IgD on naive B cells, stimulating proliferation of this cellular pool. Consistent with this hypothesis, treatment of TMNCs with pronase to reduce surface Ig expression resulted in abrogation of the proliferative response to N. lactamica OMVs, but not to PWM or CpG ODN. Furthermore, treatment with polyclonal anti- and anti- BCR Abs had the same effect, indicating that N. lactamica OMVs may induce polyclonal B cell proliferation via binding to cell-surface IgM and IgD, respectively. It is unclear why only naive IgD+ B cells and not isotype-switched memory B cells proliferate to N. lactamica OMVs if the B cell mitogen within is indeed a superantigen that mediates its effect through the Fab region of the BCR. One possibility is that N. lactamica OMVs may interact with additional receptors that are unique to naive B cells in addition to the BCR. A similar mechanism operates in response to HIV gp120 that also functions as a B cell superantigen ( [20](javascript:;)). HIV gp120 binds to the Fab region of the BCR but also to C-type lectin receptors expressed on a subset of IgD+ proliferation ( [20](javascript:;), [24](javascript:;)). Inhibition of C-type lectin receptor binding using blocking Abs abrogates the proliferative response to HIV gp120 in this population ( [24](javascript:;)). Both N. lactamica OMVs and Staphylococcal protein A preferentially induce proliferation of the innate B cell subsets, including marginal zone and B1 B cells ( [58](javascript:;)). These subsets are believed to respond to microbial challenge and produce natural Abs prior to the induction of an adaptive immune response as part of the innate immune system ( [59](javascript:;), [60](javascript:;)). Therefore, by selecting these subsets to proliferate and produce natural Abs, colonizing N. lactamica may enhance the innate immune response in the URT mucosa. Natural Ab tends to be relatively low affinity and relatively less able to mediate removal of the organism as a result. Nevertheless, the presence of natural Ab bound to N. lactamica may be a key factor in providing protection against invasion without the requirement for a proinflammatory adaptive response ( [9](javascript:;)). In support of this role, Choi and Baumgarth ( [61](javascript:;)) recently demonstrated increased production and secretion of B1 cell-derived IgM into the lower respiratory tract of mice infected with influenza virus. This IgM was responsible for 50% of the virus-neutralizing activity present in this location at day 7 of infection, demonstrating the potent biological activity of natural Ab and its role in pathogen defense ( [61](javascript:;)). Thus, the induction of IgM production by CD5+ B1 B cells in the tonsil may function in shielding colonizing N. lactamica from the adaptive immune system of the URT mucosa by augmenting innate effector mechanisms, precluding activation of an adaptive response. This would explain the absence of adaptive immunity to N. lactamica in the URT mucosa of young children during the peak age of nasopharyngeal colonization ( [9](javascript:;)). Due to its polyclonal reactivity, the natural Ab production stimulated by colonizing N. lactamica may also cross-react with N. meningitidis and offer some protection against invasive meningococcal disease. For this reason, caution should be exercised when designing N. lactamica-based vaccines for infant immunization against meningococcal disease. It is possible that the outcome of vaccination with N. lactamica may be to lower carriage of N. lactamica and reduce natural Ab production in the URT without priming a cross-reactive adaptive immune response against N. meningitidis. The polyclonal IgM response to N. lactamica OMVs is analogous to the production of natural IgA in response to the commensal flora in the mouse intestine ( [7](javascript:;)). However, unlike in the mouse intestine, N. lactamica OMVs do not stimulate IgA production in TMNCs, with little evidence of isotype switching in vitro ( [9](javascript:;)). Indeed, another URT commensal, Moraxella catarrhalis, expresses an IgD-binding protein that also stimulates the production of polyclonal IgM independently of T cell help, but not IgG or IgA without the addition of exogenous cytokines ( [62](javascript:;), [63](javascript:;)). This may reflect inherent differences in the mucosa between the intestine and the PTs, where IgG and IgM production is greater than IgA ( [64](javascript:;)). Alternatively, intestinal bacteria have been shown to indirectly mediate T cell-independent isotype switching to IgA by inducing intestinal epithelial cells to secrete a proliferation inducing ligand ( [65](javascript:;)), and via interactions with dendritic cells ( [66](javascript:;)). N. lactamica may also interact with other cell types to induce T cell-independent isotype switching to IgA in vivo in a way that does not occur in our in vitro TMNC cultures. There are several alternative mechanisms by which the polyclonal B cell response to N. lactamica OMVs may function in maintaining the host-commensal relationship in vivo that must be considered in addition to the production of innate Ig. Firstly, Staphylococcal protein A-targeted activation of naive B cells in vivo induces apoptosis that results in a permanent hole in the B1 B cell population, which is believed to allow S. aureus to escape the innate immune response during pathogenic invasion of the host ( [58](javascript:;)). It is a possibility that colonizing N. lactamica may also induce apoptosis of naive B cells in vivo as a means of evading the host immune system. However, we believe this explanation to be unlikely because this would probably result in a hyporesponsive immune system, which has not been associated with N. lactamica carriage. Secondly, polyclonal stimulation of the naive B cell pool by N. lactamica may result in the induction of a regulatory B cell population that actively suppresses the adaptive immune response to N. lactamica, allowing continued colonization of the nasopharyngeal epithelium. Putative regulatory B cells have characteristics of marginal zone B cells and have been implicated in ameliorating the progression of experimentally induced inflammatory conditions in mice via the production of IL-10 ( [67](javascript:;)). This is a distinct possibility, and further experiments are required to establish the exact functional activity of the polyclonal B cell response to N. lactamica during colonization of the human nasopharynx. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that N. lactamica OMVs induce a polyclonal B cell response in MNCs derived from the mucosa and periphery. This response appears to be mediated by a protein in the outer membrane of N. lactamica and is dependent upon the expression of cell-surface Ig on B cells to function. We hypothesize that the mitogen is a superantigen with high affinity to IgM and IgD that allows N. lactamica to specifically target the activation of innate B cell subsets, resulting in the production of natural Ab by CD5+ B1 B cells ( [9](javascript:;)). This response may be critical in maintaining immunological ignorance in the host by augmenting innate effector mechanisms, precluding activation of the adaptive immune system. B cell superantigens and the ability to polyclonally activate the B cell pool may thus be widespread in the normal bacterial flora that colonizes mucosal epithelia, providing a fundamental mechanism by which host tolerance and the host-commensal relationship is maintained.
