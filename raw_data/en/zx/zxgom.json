About a quarter of all immunization (EPI)delivery sites in Dhaka city were surveyed during 1999. The EPI services in urban Dhaka are deli-vered through a partnership of the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) and non-governmental organiza-tions (NGOs). About 77% of the EPI delivery sites in Dhaka were under the management of NGOs,and 62% of all vaccinations were provided through these sites. The outreach facilities (both GoB andNGO) provided immunization services at a much lower cost than the permanent static facilities. Theaverage cost per measles-vaccinated child (MVC), an indirect measure of number of children fullyimmunized (FIC__the number of children immunized by first year of life), was US$ 11.61. If all the immunization doses delivered by the facilities were administered to children who were supposed to beimmunized (FVC), the cost per child would have been US$ 6.91. The wide gap between the cost perMVC and the cost per FVC implies that the cost of immunizing children can be reduced significantlythrough better targeting of children. The incremental cost of adding new services or interventions withcurrent EPI was quite low, not significantly higher than the actual cost of new vaccines or drugs to beadded. NGOs in Dhaka mobilized about US$ 15,000 from the local community to support the immu-nization activities. Involving local community with EPI activities not only will improve the sustain-ability of the programme but will also increase the immunization coverage.

A fully-immu-nized child (FIC) receives six standard EPI antigensthrough eight vaccinations given in the first year oflife. The recommended schedule is: one shot of BacilleCalmette Guerin (BCG) at birth, three doses of oralpolio vaccine (OPV) together with three shots of diph-theria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) at age 6, 10, and 14 weeks,and one shot of measles vaccine at age 9 months. Alongwith these six antigens, the routine EPI also included Correspondence and reprint requests should be addressed to: Dr. M.

The main EPI programme (the routine EPI)is supplemented by other interventions, such as National Immunization Day (NID), mop-up after NID, acute flac-cid paralysis (AFP) surveillance, and maternal and neo-natal tetanus (MNT) surveillance. EPI has reduced morbidity and mortality from vac- cine-preventable diseases in Bangladesh, but little isknown about costs and effectiveness of urban EPI. Acomprehensive review in 1998 and two studies on thecost-effectiveness of the Bangladesh EPI have pointedout the need for collecting cost information from urbanareas (1-4). Unlike rural Bangladesh, urban EPI isdelivered through a partnership between the publicsector and the private sector. In fact, the private ser-vice providers, especially NGOs, play such an impor-tant role in urban EPI that estimates based on national-level expenditure or cost data will be a significant under-estimate of total costs if the contribution of NGOs isnot included. However, the exact level of involvementof NGOs in EPI delivery was not known at the time ofthe study. The national-level data do not include all thecosts incurred by NGOs and, therefore, an attempt toestimate the costs of urban EPI will be extremely use-ful for calculating the actual cost of immunization inBangladesh. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design and sampling This facility-based study estimated the costs of provid- ing routine EPI services from the perspective of EPIservice providers. A comprehensive list of all the faci-lities involved in the delivery of EPI services in Dhakacity was used as the sampling frame to select a randomsample of facilities. The then Urban Health Programmeof ICDDR,B prepared the list to better understand thesupply environment of primary healthcare services inDhaka city (5). Information contained in the list wasused for stratifying the EPI delivery sites by type (stat-ic and outreach) and location (zone within Dhaka city).For the classification of the EPI sites by type, healthcentres operating one day or less per week were definedas outreach sites, while all others were categorized asstatic sites. From each of the strata defined, 25% of thefacilities, chosen at random, generated a sample of 132EPI delivery sites. The classification of health facilities by ownership (government/NGO) could not be carried out prior to drawing of the sample due to lack of infor-mation. Since the study selected a large proportion(25%) of all EPI sites, the results of the survey shouldindicate the relative importance of the Government ofBangladesh (GoB) and NGO service providers in urbanDhaka. Data collection Facility-based data were collected from the EPI deli- very sites for 1999. Two approaches were followed forcollecting data on the use of resources, costs, and num-ber of immunizations delivered. The first approachobtained information on the use of resources and thenumber of vaccinations administered from the record-keeping and accounting books of the facility. The sec-ond approach interviewed facility staff to obtain rele-vant additional information. In most cases, the manag-er or the vaccinator of the facility was interviewed. Toensure that the enumerators collect all the relevant datafrom the health facilities, a structured questionnairewas designed. The cost part of the instrument collect-ed data on all the resources used in the process ofdelivering EPI services, including donated items, vol-unteer time, resources provided through other healthactivities, and space provided by the communities. Theresources reviewed included a comprehensive list ofcapital and recurrent items. The capital items of EPIincluded vehicle, equipment, e.g. refrigerator, coldboxes, etc., furniture, e.g. tables, chairs, etc., and train-ing of facility staff to increase human capital endow-ment (long-term training leading to a diploma or adegree). The recurrent items of EPI included salary(salaries and benefits of manager, vaccinator, physi-cian, etc.), rent (rent, utilities, operation, and mainte-nance), vaccines, supplies, e.g. syringe, ice-pack, etc.,transport, and recurrent training (short-term trainingfor maintaining skills and knowledge of the serviceproviders). For obtaining the annualized value of landand buildings, the study collected information on thecurrent rent for all facilities. If the facility was ownedby the service provider rather being rented from others,e.g. GoB facilities, the rent value for the facility wasimputed at the average rent for sites of the same type(static/outreach) and location (zone). Capital costs were annualized using a discount rate of 5%, and the economic life of all EPI-relevant capi-tal items was assumed to be five years. For health-sec-tor cost-effectiveness analysis, most researchers prefer Khan MM et al. J Health Popul Nutr Dec 2004406 using a low discount rate of 3-5%. Since a number of EPI costing studies used a 5% discount rate, using thesame rate will allow an easy comparison of results ofthe study with prior studies. For non-exclusive resources,such as resources used in delivery of other primaryhealthcare services as well, costs were apportioned toEPI based on the proportion of time spent by the serviceproviders on EPI activities. Cost data obtained werefor 1999. All the local currency values were convertedinto US dollars using the 1999 exchange rate of US$1.00=Tk 49.50 (6). For costing the vaccines, the 1997UNICEF prices were inflated by a factor of 2.5% peryear. The survey collected information on other vari-ables relating to EPI service-delivery, such as days ofoperation of the facility per year, hours of operationper day, and number of vaccines delivered per year.This study did not collect any information on house-hold-level costs, such as travel costs of the mother andchild to the EPI delivery facility. RESULTS EPI delivery sites and EPI sessions The EPI delivery sites were usually located in or near residential areas of urban Dhaka. A typical static facilitywas located in a large building with multiple roomsproviding health and non-health services to the popu-lation in the area. The types of services deliveredinclude: maternal and child health services, curativecare, family planning, microcredit activities, literacysessions, etc. A typical outreach facility was located ina much smaller building in a residential area not well-connected to other parts of the city by main roads.Outreach sites do not have resident EPI staff, andteams travel there from other static sites. Of the 132 sites surveyed by the study, less than a quarter were GoB-run facilities, and about 60% of allthe sites were NGO-run outreach centres. In 1999,38% of 11,028 EPI sessions in the surveyed sites wereorganized by the government static sites, 3% by thegovernment outreach sites, 29% by the NGO staticsites, and 31% by the NGO outreach sites. On average,the EPI delivery sites organized 84 (range 12-288) EPIsessions per site per year. NGOs played a very impor-tant role in the delivery of EPI services in urbanDhaka. About 77% of the EPI delivery sites in Dhakacity were under the management of NGOs, and these sitesorganized 60% of the EPI sessions. The predominance ofNGOs in the delivery of EPI in urban Bangladesh is in sharp contrast to the delivery structure in rural areas, where it is almost exclusively a publicly-run programme. Cost of EPI services The cost of EPI service-delivery by various cost items is shown in Table 1. The total annual cost of routineEPI services in the surveyed EPI delivery sites wasUS$ 467,171. The capital cost constituted 24% of thetotal cost. Since EPI is a labour-intensive programme,personnel cost constituted 51% of the total cost. Table1 shows that about 53% of the total EPI cost in urbanDhaka was due to the activities of NGOs. If we consi-der cost allocation within the GoB and NGO struc-tures, about half of all EPI costs in the NGO sector wasdue to service-delivery through the outreach sites, whileit was only 8% for the government sector outreachsites. This indicates the emphasis NGOs assign on deli-vering EPI services from outreach sites rather thanfrom static sites. Table 2 reports the average cost per facility by own- ership-type and facility-type categories. The averagecost of running an EPI facility was US$ 3,500 per yearin Dhaka city in 1999. However, the costs varied sig-nificantly by ownership type, i.e. whether the facilitieswere run by NGOs or GoB. In general, the static siteswere more expensive to organize than the outreachsites for both the GoB and NGO sectors. The averagecost of running a static and an outreach delivery sitewas about US$ 7,500 and US$ 2,100 respectively. Thecost of running a GoB static site was US$ 8,300 com-pared to US$ 6,500 for NGOs. NGOs needed less moneyto run the outreach sites__US$ 1,300 per site per year__ compared to US$ 2,900 for the government sites. The NGO outreach sites had a much lower salary cost, asthey usually had only vaccinators to provide services.As expected, the permanent static sites used capitalitems much more intensively than the outreach sites.On average, the capital cost of the static sites was about30% of the total EPI cost and only about 5% for out-reach sites. Effectiveness of delivery structure Table 3 presents a number of effectiveness or output measures of urban EPI. The surveyed EPI deliverysites provided 508,188 vaccinations through 11,028EPI sessions in 1999. The distribution of of vaccinations was due 407 Cost of child immunizations in urban Bangladesh to the delivery of OPV , and the lowest was for measles. DPT and OPV doses were supposed to be deliveredtogether, but the number of DPT doses delivered wasabout 19% lower than that of OPV . This probably indi-women compared to the outreach sites for all six antigensin the routine EPI. On average, 46 vaccinations were pro-vided per EPI session organized or about 12 vaccina-tions per hour of session. A number of delivery sitesTable 1.

Table 3 indicates that 34%of all vaccinations was carried out by the governmentstatic sites, 4% by the government outreach sites, 38%by the NGO static sites, and 24% by the NGO outreachsites. The static sites immunized more children andreported zero vaccinations during their EPI sessions.An EPI session providing no vaccination at all indicatesthe presence of slack time of EPI delivery staff due tolack of demand. All the EPI delivery sites also reported asignificant wastage of vaccines, and the wastage rateswere used for estimating the total cost of immunization.Khan MM et al. J Health Popul Nutr Dec 2004408 Average cost of delivering EPI Using the numbers reported in Tables 1 and 3, we can calculate the average cost per unit of output producedby the EPI delivery sites. Table 4 reports the averagecosts per unit of various outcome measures. The aver-age cost per EPI session in 1999 was about US$ 42,while the average cost per dose administered, exclud-ing vitamin A and tetanus toxoid, was US$ 1.18. Sincemeasles is the last vaccine a child should get in the EPIschedule, the number of children immunized againstmeasles can be used as an indirect measure of fully-immunized children. The average cost per measles-vaccinated child (MVC) was US$ 11.61, and the aver-age cost was lower for the NGO facilities compared tothat for the government facilities. We do not have anyinformation on the number of children fully immu-nized by 12 months of life (FIC). In our sample, theestimated number of children was lower compared toother vaccinations, we can use MVC as a rough guide ofFIC. Therefore, US$ 11.61 may be considered an approxi-mation of per FIC cost in urban Dhaka. Table 4 also reports a hypothetical number, cost per FVC, and cost of providing all the EPI vaccinations toall infants without incomplete vaccinations (some chil-dren receiving only few vaccines) or double-dosing.This hypothetical cost per FVC is simply the total costof providing three doses of DPT, three doses of OPV , Table 3.

Since the average duration of a session was 4.0 hours, total hours of sessions can be calculated by multiplying the number of sessions by vaccine; TT=Tetanus toxoid Table 4.

FVC was computed in two steps: first, cost perspecific antigen was calculated, and then FVC wascomputed (Tables 5 and 6 in Appendix). The averageestimated cost per FVC is only about US$ 6.91, imply-ing that many children received partial immunizations(lower completion rate due to drop-outs), and some mighthave received the same vaccines more frequently thanthe EPI schedule suggests. The cost per MVC (US$11.61), in general, should be close to the hypotheticalcost per FVC (US$ 6.91) in the absence of significantpartial vaccinations or double-dosing. The high cost ofMVC compared to the hypothetical minimum cost indi-cates that the system (for both GoB and NGOs) can bemade much more effective if children are identifiedand vaccinated in a timely manner without significantmistargeting or double-dosing. For the purpose of esti-mating the costs without mistargeting or double-dosing,it is not necessary to identify the mistargeted cases. Ifthe number of children receiving measles vaccinationwere fully immunized, we can calculate the total vac-cination cost for the cohort. The ratio of this hypothe-tical cost and actual cost may be used as a measure ofdegree of mistargeting by both GoB and NGOs. Cost per vaccinated child, either the cost per MVC or the hypothetical cost per FVC, can be used as ameasure of efficiency of the EPI delivery system. Table4 indicates that the cost per MVC was the highest (US$12.93) for the government static sites and was the low-est (US$ 9.80) for the NGO outreach sites. Betweenthe government and the NGO delivery structures, theNGO static facilities were more cost-effective (US$11.50) than the government static facilities (US$ 12.93).The NGO outreach sites were also more cost-effectivethan the government outreach sites (US$ 9.80 and US$10.07 per MVC respectively). If the cost of deliveringTT vaccines is included with other vaccines, the aver-age cost per MVC increases by about 14 cents. If thecost of distributing vitamin A is added, the averagecost per MVC increases by 77 cents. Therefore, addingthese other services with the traditional vaccine doesnot increase the cost per child significantly. The incre-mental cost of adding a new vaccine will be slightlyhigher than the cost of the vaccine itself. The addition-al cost of administering the vaccine or distribution ofvitamins appears relatively low. Financing of EPI The EPI activities of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), GoB, are supported by a donor con-sortium comprising GoB, World Bank, United Nations Children's Fund, World Health Organization, U.S. Agencyfor International Development, Japanese InternationalCooperation Agency, and Department for InternationalDevelopment-UK. Additional donor involvement wasfound in the surveyed EPI delivery sites of Dhaka CityCorporation (DCC), such as Norweigian Aid, SwedishInternational Development Agency, Ford Foundation,Action Aid, etc. These additional sources of support canbe categorized into three groups: (a) agencies provid-ing both monetary and logistical (vaccines, supplies,training) support, (b) agencies providing only monetarysupport, and (c) agencies providing only logistical sup-port. The resources received by all EPI service imple-menters from the EPI Headquarters were vaccines,supplies, EPI-related training, and some capital equip-ment. If we exclude these common resources, the addi-tional resources that NGOs mobilized for EPI wereabout US$ 177,460 for the surveyed facilities. If weproject this cost for urban Bangladesh, the additionalresources mobilized by NGOs for EPI services becomeUS$ 1.4 million. Since these resources do not show upin the macro-level cost accounting of EPI, the cost ofdelivering EPI is usually underestimated. Furthermore,NGOs in Dhaka were able to generate about US$ 15,000(of US$ 177,460) from local community resources. This was estimated from the resources used by the NGOoutreach sites where most space (rent) and furniturewere provided by the local community, such as a roomin private households, schools, pharmacy, culturalclubs, etc. Thus, even the poor communities of the citycan potentially support some EPI activities. DISCUSSION EPI is one of the most cost-effective health interven- tions with high potential benefits and low costs (3,4,7-12). Most cost studies of EPI used national- or regional-level secondary data without supplementing informa-tion by collecting facility-level data. This study esti-mated the cost of delivering EPI in urban Bangladeshusing facility-based surveys. The survey results indi-cate that the secondary data sources would have under-estimated the urban EPI costs by at least 40-50%. TheNGO outreach-delivery structure is highly dependenton community-level resources, and none of these areaccounted for in the secondary data. Even the govern-ment delivery system solicits additional resources fromthe communities around their outreach sites. Despitethe underestimation of costs, EPI remains a highly cost-effective intervention. If we use cost per MVC as a Khan MM et al. J Health Popul Nutr Dec 2004410 measure of cost per fully-immunized child, the cost remains less than US$ 15 per child. This excludes thesocietal costs of vaccination that were not assessed inthis study. An important conclusion of this study is that it is feasible to generate a significant amount of local resourcesfor delivering EPI services. All the NGO outreach sitesmobilized resources from the communities in whichthey work. Therefore, it is feasible to generate somelocal resources even from poor regions for conductingimmunization services. Involving the local communitywith EPI activities not only will improve the sustain-ability of the programme but will also help increaserates of immunization coverage. Furthermore, in theabsence of community involvement, GoB and NGOswould have to supply these resources, especially ifemphasis is put on the delivery of EPI through staticsites. The additional resources generated by NGOs in-cluded resources from local communities and fromadditional donor agencies. The estimated additionalresource generated by NGOs in urban Bangladesh wasabout US$ 1.4 million per year. If we add this cost withthe estimates of Levin et al. (4), total cost of EPI for Bangladesh becomes about US$ 31 million, about 6%higher than their estimate. Although it is not a very sig-nificant increase in total cost, it is important to derivethe actual resource use in the EPI programme for plan-ning and policy analysis. If the average costs of delivering different types of services are considered, it is clear that the outreachfacilities (both government and non-government) aremore cost-effective than the static facilities. The NGO-outreach sites delivered EPI services at the lowestaverage cost, probably due to the externality created bycommunity participation, using capital items less inten-sively and having minimal staff providing services. Itis usually assumed that the public sector must organizeand deliver preventive services, especially in poorcountries where the demand for preventive services isexpected to be low. The fact that NGOs delivered 62%of all immunizations in urban Dhaka clearly demon-strates no inherent disadvantage of NGOs compared tothe public sector in providing immunization services.Furthermore, NGOs in Dhaka delivered EPI services ata lower cost than the government sites, which suggeststhat NGOs can successfully organize and deliver pre-ventive services in a poor community and, in the case ofurban Dhaka, they were more efficient than the GoB.Another important finding of the study is that the incremental cost of adding services should not be sig-nificantly higher than the actual cost of new vaccinesor drugs to be added. The new vaccine will obviouslyincrease the cost of acquiring the commodities andsupplies, but the current delivery structure has enoughslack in the system to be able to deliver the new vac-cine without employing additional personnel or otherinputs. For example, the number of vaccine doses deli-vered, including the distribution of vitamin A capsules,was less than 12 per hour of EPI session in urban Dhaka.This number can be increased by 50% without chang-ing the size of the facilities or the number of personnelinvolved with delivery. This study also indicates that the current EPI deli- very structure could be made more efficient. Apartfrom the wastage of vaccines and slack time of person-nel, better targeting of children alone should signifi-cantly lower the average cost of EPI. If the completionrate of vaccination can be improved and double-dosingavoided, cost per MVC should decline to about US$ 7.The estimated cost per MVC was US$ 11.61, indicating that perfect targeting can reduce the cost per FVC by about 60%. However, no system can be 100% efficientin terms of targeting or completion rates, but it shouldbe possible to reduce the cost per MVC by at least US$2-3 by better managing the delivery structure, trainingproviders, and mobilizing the community. Better use ofexisting human resources and vaccines should reducethe cost per FVC even further without increasing theservice-delivery costs. One of the important aspects of the EPI delivery structure identified by the study is the complex natureof the system in urban Dhaka. The predominance ofNGOs in the delivery of EPI in urban Bangladesh is insharp contrast to the EPI delivery structure in ruralareas, where it is almost exclusively a publicly-runprogramme. Despite the high degree of involvement ofthe private sector in urban EPI, the delivery structurehas remained relatively inefficient. Therefore, sub-con-tracting health activities to the private sector, by itself, may not improve efficiency in the delivery of EPI. It isimportant to identify the factors affecting the efficien-cy of NGO and government facilities, including thepayment mechanisms adopted by the contracting arrange-ment. 411 Cost of child immunizations in urban Bangladesh ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This study was conducted by the Health Economics Programme (HEP) of ICDDR,B: Centre for Health andPopulation Research with funding from HealthSystems and Economics Unit and WHO/LondonSchool of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
