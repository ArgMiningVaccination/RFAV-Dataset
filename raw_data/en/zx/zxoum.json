A wide range of therapies and treatments exists under the term 'complementary therapy', which makes it difficult to supply a blanket definition. but alternative therapies are typically unproven or are shown to be ineffective. There is no scientific or medical evidence for a few complementary therapies and lots of alternative therapies, and that they could also be unsafe or cause harmful side effects. Conventional medicine is based on rigorous science and evaluation. Historically this has not been the case for complementary therapies. Some complementary therapies have now been tested in good quality scientific trials, but most have not. [Conventional medicine](https://www.alliedacademies.org/journals.php) and complementary therapies can often be used alongside one another. However, it's important to inform your doctor and your complementary [practitioner](https://www.alliedacademies.org/allied-journal-of-medical-research-advertising-20.html) of all medicines, treatments and remedies you're taking or use. Some complementary therapies have the potential to cause side effects or interact with [conventional medicines](https://www.alliedacademies.org/allied-journal-of-medical-research/guidelines.php). Never stop taking prescribed medications, or change the dose, without first discussing together with your [doctor](https://www.alliedacademies.org/allied-journal-of-medical-research/inpress.php).
