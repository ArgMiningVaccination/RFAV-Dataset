The research was conducted this summer by First Draft, amid growing concern that dangerous narratives and conspiracy theories may result in increasing vaccine skepticism. [Executive summary: Under the surface: Covid-19 vaccine narratives, misinformation and data deficits on social media (PDF)](https://firstdraftnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FirstDraft_Underthesurface_Executivesummary_Final.pdf?x21167) [Full report: Under the surface: Covid-19 vaccine narratives, misinformation and data deficits on social media (PDF)](https://firstdraftnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FirstDraft_Underthesurface_Fullreport_Final.pdf?x21167) Our research demonstrates the complexity of the vaccine information ecosystem, where a cacophony of voices and narratives have coalesced to create an environment of extreme uncertainty. Two topics are driving a large proportion of the current global vaccine discourse, especially around a Covid-19 vaccine: the \"political and economic motives\" of actors and institutions involved in vaccine development and the \"safety, efficacy and necessity\" concerns around vaccines. Narratives challenging the safety of vaccines have been perennial players in the online vaccine debate. Yet this research shows that narratives related to mistrust in the intentions of institutions and key figures surrounding vaccines are now driving as much of the online conversation and vaccine skepticism as safety concerns. This issue is compounded by the complexities and vulnerabilities of this information ecosystem. It is full of \"data deficits\" \u2014 situations where demand for information about a topic is high, but the supply of credible information is low \u2014 that are being exploited by bad actors. These data deficits complicate efforts to accurately make sense of the development of a Covid-19 vaccine and vaccines more generally. When people can't easily access reliable information around vaccines and when mistrust in actors and institutions related to vaccines is high, misinformation narratives rush in to fill the vacuum. The findings should act as a wake-up call as the world waits for a Covid-19 vaccine and sees routine immunization rates drop.
