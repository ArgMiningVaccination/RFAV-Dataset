Communication and Resolution Programs: Policy Goals and Legal Issues William M. Sage, MD, JD The University of Texas at Austin The Real Malpractice Problem Little Connection Between the Malpractice System and the Health Care System! How Medical Liability Affects Cost/Access/Quality of Care Two-s ided mismatch between negligence and litigation -Not only unjustified lawsuits, but also -Uncompensated injuries -High rates of avoidable error Poor process -Restricted information -Limited non-monetary remedies -Extreme delay -Lack of quality feedback to providers Misdirected focus on individual physicians rather than \"systems\" -Fear of harm to reputation -Financial stress over insurability as surance: costly over-testing -Defensive av oidance: refusing \"risky\" (sick or litigious) patients Why Isn't Malpractice Policy Part of Health Policy? Doctors and Lawyers -Longstanding professional conflict -Unfinished battles for professional l eaders -Paradox of public accountability in self - regulated profession (\"holding experts accountable to non-experts\") Government St ructure -Judicial r ather than legislative issue -Tenuous connection to state regulatory oversight -Minimal federal presence (Medicare and Medicaid not engaged) Politics -Specialized l obbying on both sides -Poster child for/against general business \"tort reform\" Periodicity and bias -\"Crises\" of mid - 1970s, mid-1980s, early 2000s -Defined by availability/affordability of physicians' malpractice insurance 5 Malpractice Crises May End, But Improvement Shouldn't \"All bleeding stops.\" - Surgical adage Crises are definitional Premiums may fall Lawsuits may drop BUT Errors remain high Compensation is poor Process is miserable Change is possible Guiding Principles for Malpractice Reform Think big: Do more than tinker with the l egal system. Start small: Start with demonstration pr ojects in the right places and with the right health care providers. Stay focused: Better health care is the goal , not more or fewer trial lawyers. Communication and Resolution Programs Tell patients what happened Try to put things right Improve safety for the future Empower and support caregivers What Do Patients Want? The truth -Did something happen? The facts -What was it? Emotional first aid -Empathy and compassion -Recognition and validation of emotions -Non-abandonment (a process, not an event) Accountability, including apology Future prevention Remediation 8 What Does the Ideal CRP Event Look Like? Early event reporting by provider Careful analysis by institution-w as unanticipated outcome caused by medical error? If so, how can recurrences be prevented? Prompt, compassionate disclosure to patient Fast, fair resolution for patient Learning at individual and institutional level Key Attributes of CRPs 1.Closer to the bedside 2.Farther from the courtroom 3.Based on teams and institutions Therefore, -Relevant to ongoing care -Focused on system improvement -More compassionate -Less adversarial -Less costly Established CRPs University of Michigan (Early set tlement) Claims half as likely, lawsuits 1/3 as likely Time to resolution cut nearly in half Reduced liability c osts University o f Illinois -Chicago (Seven Pillars) Increase in patient safety event reporting from 1,500 to 7,500 per year 50% reduction in new claims Median time to resolution now 12 months compared w ith 55 months before program \"The Need for Speed\" Delayed resolution means: Insufficient information for patients and fa milies Lack of safety improvement; feedback af ter litigation is usually irrelevant High administrative cost Slow compensation Emotional pain/adversarial stress Actuarial u npredictability for liability insurers Legal Issues Can Intrude CRPs convey an ethical and practical commitment from providers to patients, but can be constrained by: Litigation concerns Regulatory and economic c omplications These can also be barriers to patient participation ! Litigation Issues Damage caps Pre-suit notification laws Sovereign and charitable i mmunities Apology protection laws Legal representation of claimants Regulatory/Economic Issues State and federal reporting r equirements Professional disciplinary response Medicare/private insurer s ubrogation or non -payment Example: Washington State CRP Certification Proposal Important exclusions: Gross provider negligence, pr ovider impairment, boundary violations Certification process based at Foundation for Healthcare Q uality MQAC retains all current authority. All mandatory reporting requirements remain in effect -Responsibility of institution, insurer Process is voluntary, open to all Washington physicians CRP Certification group will not perform independent i nvestigations CRP Certification Review Case reviewed by multi -di sciplinary group including patient advocate, risk/claims specialists, physician leaders, individual with regulatory experience. -Reviewers can not be affiliated with institution w here event occurred Review addresses whether key elements of C RP were met Institutions/insurers can resolve CRP def iciencies and resubmit Hypothetical CRP Certification Request Provider uses bedside ultrasound, misses DVT Patient has PE, hospitalization, lost income Institution uses CRP: reporting by provider, com munication with patient, prevention plans -Provider passes ultrasound course -New institutional policy developed Financial resolution of $30K proactively provided to patient. Mandatory reporting to MQAC. Hypothetical (continued) Institution submits case fo r CRP Certification review. Review gr oup determine all key elements of CRP present. Certification report provided back to institution/insurer. Institution/insurer s end Certification Report to MQAC MQAC reviews report. Closes case as satisfactorily r esolved without additional investigation. MQAC may conduct additional investigation before det ermining if closure is appropriate. CRP Paradigm Shift Traditional Response Open Accountability Incident reporting by clinicians Delayed, often absent Immediate Communication with patient, family Deny/defend Transparent, ongoing Event analysis Physician, nurse are root cause Focus on Just Culture, system, human factors Quality improvement Provider training Drive value through system solutions, disseminated learning Financial resolution Only if family prevails on a malpractice claim Proactively address patient/family needs Care for the caregivers None Offered immediately Patient, family involvement Little to none Extensive and ongoing Washington State Medical Commission Educational Conference 2014 With Augustus A.

The interstate compact is not a formal work product of the FSMB, AIM, or the Washington Department of Health. The Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery has formally endorsed the Compact and supports the Medical Commission's request legislation. The information and views expressed in this presentation are of the author only. Goals for Today Recap the historical, legal, and policy contexts that gave rise to the consideration and development of an interstate compact. Consider the potential implications of national licensure. Provide an overview of interstate compacts. Highlight the features and processes of the proposed Interstate Medical Licensure Compact. Share selected stakeholder and media interest in the Compact. Address questions and foster discussion. Historical Background \"State\"- based regulation of physicians actually dates to colonial times: oVirginia, 1639 oMassachusetts, 1649 oNew York, 1665 In US history, state regulation of physician licensing is largely uninterrupted, except for a brief period in the mid- 1800s. However, the ACA, shifting demographics, technological advances, changes in physician specialty mix, consumer demands, and health care financing are changing expectations for how boards will regulate physicians. Large industry- based interest groups are lobbying for federal action on a national licensure system. Congress has passed or considered bills with the potential to erode state -based physician licensing. Legal/Constitutional Background Tenth Amendment to the US Constitution is generally the starting point for defense of state- based regulation of physicians. Important US Supreme Court Case law supports it: oDent v. West Virginia (1889) oHawker v. New York (1898) However, federalist approaches changed in the 20th century, creating greater opportunities for federal intervention into areas of traditional state regulation. oThe \"layer cake\" vs. the \"marble cake\" oConditional spending power Why NOT National Licensure? Important patient safety mission could be undermined: oLicensing funds are uncertain, but the same disciplinary mandate. oPublic's practical ability to complain across state lines. Could exacerbate the length and complexity of licensing, investigative and adjudicative activities Even \"military\" models, which Congress has looked to expand upon, dilute states' jurisdiction. Ignores long history of successful regulation within the state domain. Ignores federalist principles embodied in the 10th Amendment to the US Constitution. So is there a better option than federal intervention? I think so... Interstate Compacts - A Primer Like physician regulation, compacts also date to colonial times. Compacts are widely used, but not well understood, part of jurisprudence; the average state is a party to 25. They are explicitly authorized by the \"Compact Clause\" of the US Constitution (Article 1, Section 10, Clause 3) . Compacts contain elements of both contract and statutory law; as a result, they supersede state laws, rules, courts, but are neither federal nor state. States pass legislation and governors sign; the legislation must be identical to be effective. Consequently, once enacted, they are very hard to amend. As a result, effective compacts are generally drafted broadly and grant rulemaking authority to administrative organizations to allow for adjustments over time. Allow states to collectively solve shared problems without federal intervention. Interstate Medical Licensure Compact The interstate Medical Licensure Compact will: Set meaningful eligibility standards for physicians to participate. Create an Interstate Medical Licensure Commission to administer the Compact. Preserve revenues critical to state board operations. Clearly delineate the disciplinary protocols for medical and osteopathic boards in both \"principal\" and \"compact\" states. Require physicians to register their intent to practice in any and all states. Establish information systems for distribution of data between state boards. Be entirely voluntary, both for states and for physicians. Likely avert further federal encroachment on state authority for medical and osteopathic physician regulation. Promote multistate practice and telehealth in a manner responsive to patient safety. Physician Eligibility Requirements Physicians must meet the following requirements to participate in the compact: oSuccessfully pass each component of USMLE or COMLEX- USA within three (3) attempts. oSuccessfully complete a graduate medical education program. oSpecialty certification or a time -unlimited certificate from American Board of Medical Specialties or American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists. oNo discipline on any state medical license. oNo discipline related to controlled substances. oNot under investigation by any agency. Not all physicians will be eligible. Principal License A principal license serves as the entry point for eligible physicians: Physician must obtain a full and unrestricted license from a member state. State of principal license cannot award a compact privilege without an underlying license. What state can serve as state of principal license? State of physician's primary residence. State where 25 percent of medical practice occurs. Location of physician's employer. State designated for federal income taxes. Interstate Commission Interstate governmental organizations are commonplace among \"modern\" interstate compacts. The compact does not create a \"superboard\". oRole is to oversee the administrative and policy elements of the compact. oNo licensing or disciplinary role. Two representatives from each participating state (executive director or board member) participate in governance work of the Interstate Medical Licensure Commission. Does have rulemaking authority. Financial Considerations User fees are envisioned as the method for funding the Interstate Medical Licensure Commission. Analogous to how most medical and osteopathic boards operate today. Section 13 allows the Commission to collect an annual assessment from member states. While not been intended to be used, it is necessary: oStates hold ultimate fiduciary responsibility for this government organization. oTax implications for the Commission. oQualified immunity implications for members serving on the Commission. oBoards will continue to set fees for licensure and renewal for physicians licensed in their states as they do now. Investigative Functions Currently, states face challenges in effectively investigating complaints involving physicians beyond their borders. The compact would allow: oBoards to undertake joint investigations. oThe timely sharing of investigative material. oStrengthened enforcement of administrative subpoenas across state lines for board investigations. oThe information will be kept confidential, per Compact provisions. Registration and IT System An essential element of the Compact - member state boards have data on if a physician is, or is capable of, practicing in a given state. By requiring a full and unrestricted license to be issued, every state has a record of physicians who may practice there. More broadly, the Commission will serve as a clearinghouse for licensing data and disciplinary data: oStates, in approving physicians to participate in the Compact, will notify the Commission, who will in turn notify other states. oStates, including the principal state, will notify the Compact of licensure status, who will in turn notify other states. oThe Commission will set out in rule disciplinary reporting requirements for boards, which will be accessible by member states. Dr. Doctor decides to apply to state of Emergency Dr. Doctor first decides if he only wishes to practice in the state of Emergency, or if he wants to practice in multiple states. If Dr. Doctor decides to seek only a standard state license (i.e., limited to practice in the state of Emergency), then he submits the normal application, documents and fee to the state board. If Dr. Doctor decides wants to practice not only in his state of principal licensure but in other states within the Compact , he submits the normal application and documents for the principal state license, plus he submits a compact application with the principal state board. He submits only the check for the home state license to the state board. As part of his application, Dr. Doctor also submits to the Compact a registration form indicating he has applied to the state of Emergency, but also wants to practice in the states of Being, Decay, Matter, and Confusion and submits the appropriate fee(s). Sample Workflow - Licensing with a Compact Prepared by Blake T. Maresh, MPA, CMBE Dr. Doctor's applications (both for principal state and the Compact authorization) are reviewed by the state of Emergency Medical Board. If he meets the qualifications for each, he may be an authorization for the compact. A compact authorization can only be held in conjunction with the principal state license. The principal state communicates that it has issued authorized Dr. Doctor for the Compact. When the Compact is notified by the home state that the physician has been authorized, it will notify the medical boards in the states of Being, Decay, Matter, and Confusion. The Compact will also disburse the application fees to the other states. Any administrative fees will be kept by the Commission to offset operating expenses.. Prepared by Blake T. Maresh, MPA, CMBE Matter Being Decay Emergency Confusion Sample Workflow - Discipline within a Compact Prepared by Blake T. Maresh, MPA, CMBE Dr. Doctor's home state is the State of Emergency. He applied for and received a compact privilege, and has licenses via the compact in the States of Being, Matter, Decay and Confusion. Dr. Doctor commits a significant medical error while practicing in the State of Being, and the patient files a complaint with the State of Being Medical Board (BMB). C The BMB opens the complaint and refers it for investigation. The Board also notifies the Compact of the open investigation, which in turn provides notification to the other states where Dr. Doctor is licensed. I I I I I I IMPORTANT NOTE: Regardless of any action(s) taken by any compact state against a licensee, he or she retains an underlying principal state license. While any state can act on a license issued via the compact, only the board in the state of principal licensure can act on the principal license. Prepared by Blake T. Maresh, MPA, CMBE After investigation, the BMB decides to take action. Based upon the type of action taken, there are two possible outcomes for Dr. Doctor's multistate authorization. If the BMB takes an action that prevents Dr. Doctor's ability to practice (i.e., revocation, suspension, or surrender in lieu of discipline), then the action taken by the BMB affects Dr. Doctor's ENTIRE multistate authorization. In this case, he may only still practice in his state of principal license unless action is taken on that license by the EMB. M M M M M M The EMB must then decide whether to act upon Dr. Doctor's principal state license based on the action of the BMB. If it does, this action is also reported to the Compact for documentation. When the action is final, the BMB reports it to the Compact, which in turn communicates to all the other states where Dr. Doctor is licensed, including the state of principal licensure. The other \"compact\" states then rescind their licenses as well without further action. M Prepared by Blake T. Maresh, MPA, CMBE If the BMB takes a lesser action than revocation, suspension, or surrender in lieu of discipline, this information is also reported to the Compact to be reported to the other states where Dr. Doctor is licensed. For those \"compact\" states, they have three alternatives: M No action: If a state board feels no further action is necessary against Dr. Doctor, no action need be taken. Retry: Each state board reserves its authority to take action. For example, the state of Confusion Medical Board could separately investigate, charge and take action against Dr. Doctor if it felt the BMB's sanctions did not adequately protect the public. Concur: The other \"compact\" states can simply affirm the action of the BMB against Dr. Doctor. As before, the EMB must decide whether to act upon Dr. Doctor's underlying principal state license. If it does, this action is also reported to the Compact for documentation. M M M M Impact of Disciplinary Actions Principal State Action Major Action Minor Action Initial Action Other licenses immediately placed on identical status without additional action by other member board(s). Other member licensing board(s) may: 1)Deem factual f indings to be res judicata and impose same or lesser sanctions; 2)Take separate action under its resp ective medical or osteopathic practice act; or 3)Take no action.

Create a pathway to national licensure - instead, it would likely forestall any further federal action. Clone the Nurse Licensure Compact, which is different in a number of respects. Alter the existing in -state functions or authority of medical and osteopathic boards. Increase fees for in -state licenses. Next Steps The final draft of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact has just been released. State boards, legislatures, and stakeholders will review during the fall. Legislative action on the Compact will begin in January. Seven states are needed to activate the Compact.

Preventing Inappropriate initiation of Rx opioids The past two years approximately one -t hird of people had at least one prescription for a controlled substance (e.g. Vicodin, Valium, Ambien) More t han half of adults take a prescription medicine of any kind. Taking prescription medicines is now typical and normal, talking about medication usage with family members purposefully and thoughtfully is not yet normal. Access issues Most teens get Rx opiates from Own Rx (33%) A friend (28%) Family gave (10%) Took from a home (9%) Don't accept unneeded Rx's Dispose o f unneeded medicines Lock up medications that are needed Addressing motivation issues Parents should reflect on their own use of alcohol/medication/drugs Consider what messages they are sending Determine if they are the messages they want to be sending Consider their youths' situation - e.g. trauma Be explicit about reasons for their use and expectations for youth This may be hard and involve the adult seeking help A variety of effective treatments are available including bo th behavioral/counseling and medications. Both help to restore a degree of normalcy to brain f unction and behavior, resulting in increased employment rates and lower risk of HIV and other diseases and criminal behavior. Although behavioral and medications can be extremely u seful when utilized alone integrating both types of treatments is generally the most effective approach.

Her brother, at age 34 and diagnosed with Crohn's, had part of his intestine removed. Her father suffered a heart- attack which resulted in an emergency quadruple bypass surgery. And, in 2006, her mother's biopsied brain tumor was identified as non- Hodgkin lymphoma. Experiences in the different hospitals varied greatly for the family: sometimes there was disregard for their needs; sometimes there was incredible attention and responsiveness. Often t he two ends of the spectrum occurred within hours of each other in the same hospital. But, when care and caring happened simultaneously, the results were powerful. Inspired by her personal encounters and family's history, Bonnie joined the University of Washington Medical Center's Inpatient Patient and Family Centered Care (IPFCC) Advisory Council in 2007 as a family advisor. During her tenure, the IPFCC council's accomplishments include ensuring documents are patient and family friendly, participating in charge nurse education, transforming the meal delivery system to include on- demand menu options, and creating a staff training video about the voice of the patient (that she's featured in!). In September 2013, Bonnie was honored to attend the day -long Hea lthPact Forum; in November, she joined its Patient and Family Advisory Council (PFAC). Energized by the trends in healthcare, Bonnie is excited by PFAC's transition into the Foundation for Health Care Quality and the opportunities it brings to widen the au dience for patient and family centered care. Professionally, Bonnie brings to over ten years of operations management experience to the group with expertise in process evaluation, continuous improvement, organizational development, team building, communications, and strategic and event planning. She holds a MBA in Change Management as well as a Master of Education. For fun, she likes to throw glamorous dinner parties, listen to old radio detective shows, and watch cartoons with her husband.

After growing up in the Jim Crow -era South, Dr. White went on to become the first African American graduate of Stanford University's medical school, the first African- American resident and surgery professor at Yale and later the first black department head at Harvard's teaching hospitals . Seeing Patients draws on both original research and Dr. White's own experiences to examine how care is affected by the unconscious prejudice of providers. After serving in the U.S. Army Medical Corps from 1966 -1968, Dr. White studied at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, obtaining his PhD in orthopedic biomechanics in 1970. There, he met his wife Anita, with whom he has three adult daughters.

As a captain in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, he cared for patients in a Vietnamese leper colony, volunteered for a medical rescue miss ion on a non- secured mountainside, and provided a year of hard, dedicated orthopedic care for the troops. For all of these activities, Dr. White was awarded the Bronze Star. Since then, Dr. White has received various awards honoring his character, his dist inguished career and his commitment to diversity in medicine. These include the 2006 AAOS Diversity Award. The honor recognizes AAOS fellows who have significantly contributed to the advancement of diversity in orthopaedics through the recruiting, mentoring and leadership of minority and women orthopedists, and the treatment of diverse patient populations. Dr. White is an internationally known, widely published authority on biomechanics of the spine, fracture healing, and surgical and non- surgical care of the spine. He has authored or coauthored more than 250 scientific and clinical publications including chapters, books, and articles.

I'm not going to indulge in blame , guilt, and certainly not despair. We know that where there are problems, there ar e opportunities. T he opportunity this problem gives is that if we can move towards solving it, our success will go far bey ond the health care field. Solving this problem will not only make us a healthier nation, it will make us a stronger and richer nation as well. The problem I'm talking about is disparities in health c are\u2014that is, inequalities in the way we as doctors treat our patients. I'm talking about all of us, including the vast majority of us who are absolutely committed to providing the best care we can to all our patients, regardless of race, gender, age, sexu al orientation, or any other characteristic that creates differences between ourselves and those we treat. The inequality in treatment I will be describing and documenting for you is not simply a national health care problem. It is, in a real sense, a major human problem. Disparities in treatment are a paradigm for many of our local, regional, and global human problems. Finding solutions to inequalities in our health care will likewise help us achieve solutions to some of the great global problems. This is because cultural literacy and skillful accurate cross cultural communication along with the shedding of what I call the isms help so greatly to focus us on the celebration of our comm on humanity, which moves us forward as a global society. To the extent that we solve these problems in the health care arena and learn to focus on and celebrate our common humanity, we will be engaged in a kind of humanitarian evolutionary process. The process of solving the health care challenge will develop skills and a bilities that will help us avoid war and will facilitate our ability to recover from the wars that we cannot avoid. Moreover, the development of cultural literacy, cross cultural communications, self - awareness, and the elimination of -isms will help to fa cilitate our recovery from such devastating global realities as pandemics, tsunamis, tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, and avalanches. To put it a different way, in order to eliminate health care disparities, we must hone our cross cultural commu nication skills and self -awareness as we eliminate our practice of \"-isms. \" These same skills are broadly applicable to our global problems including war. One of the themes of Dr. King's inspiring life was his strong advocacy for social justice to superc ede the practice of \"- isms.\" Respectfully, Augustus A.

This book by a pioneering black surgeon takes on one of the few critically important topics that hav - en't figured in the heated debate over health care reform\u2014the largely hidden yet massive injustice of bias in medical treatment. Growing up in Jim Crow-era Tennessee and training and teaching in overwhelmingly white medical institutions, Gus White witnessed first - hand how prejudice works in the world of medicine. And while race relations have changed dramatically, old ways of thinking die hard. In Seeing Patients White draws upon his experience in startlingly differ - ent worlds to make sense of the unconscious bias that riddles medical treatment, and to explore what it means for health care in a diverse twenty-first-century America. White and co-author David Chanoff use extensive research and inter - views with leading physicians to show how subconscious stereotyp - ing influences doctor-patient interactions, diagnosis, and treatment. Their book brings together insights from the worlds of social psychol - ogy, neuroscience, and clinical practice to define the issues clearly and, most importantly, to outline a concrete approach to fixing this fundamental inequity in the delivery of health care. Augustus A. White III, M.D., is Professor of Medical Education and Orthopedic Surgery at Harvard Medical School and the first African American department chief at Harvard's teaching hospitals. David Chanoff is a writer living in Marlborough, MA.\"I enjoyed the book immensely. I liked the fact it has so many interesting vignette s about your life's journey, including your experiences in Vietnam, your medical career, and your astonishing ride to chair of or thopedic surgery at BIH.

Describing a life as a preeminent orthopaedic surgeon and medical scholar, he gracefully interweaves the personal evolution and in sights of a trail blazing racial pioneer with a fact-based anal ysis of America's unfinished business in addressing unequal treatment in medical care. With Healthcare reform now at the top of the nation's agenda, this is a must read for medical professionals and the general public. Further, this book should be brought to the attention of all individuals whose policies and deci sions affect the delivery of equitable Healthcare.\" - Price M. Cobbs, author of My American Life: From Rage to Entitlement and coauthor of Black Rage . #### \"We couldn't put down Gus White's story of how he fought his way through a racially segregated medical world to become one of the nation's finest orthopedic surgeons. It is a part of the civil rights revolution that we rarely confront, and his courage a nd tenacity have paved the way for hundreds of other African-Ameri can and Latino doctors to follow in his footsteps. What is even more remarkable is how he fought these battles and managed to emerge with the extraordinary sensitivity and compassion that have made him a great doctor. Seeing Patients , though, is far more than an inspirational autobiography. Gus White is a central player in today's effort to rid the American health delivery system of the built in disparities that deprive women and minoriti es of equal care. In this book White exposes what these often shocki ng disparities are, how they come about, and, most important, he explains what we need to do about them.

Part memoir, part history, and part instructive guide for physicians and patients, this powerful book opens with evidential narratives that chronicle the historical origins of racial bias in medicine and science - dating back to the thinking of scientists such as Plato, Aristotle and Ga len! Dr. White recounts the innumerable prejudices and injustices he had to confront as an African American growing up in the segregated South, and later in his quest to become a physician in the 1960's. He explains how these same ingrained biases impeded his journey and stifled those of so many others. More sobering is his admonition that these unconscious biases (age, gender, race, etc.) are the sine qua non of today's healthcare disparities resulting in unnecess ary pain, suffering and even death. As a lay person, I was moved by Dr. White's sensitive approach to such a highly provocative subject; the statistics are devastating and he artrending. He lays out his case to make \"humanitarian and egalitarian medicine\" the norm and asks physicians - as well patients - to open their eyes and examine the unconscious biases we all harbor, and use that self-awareness for change. This should be required reading for anyone with a conscience...\" - Linda Kenney Miller, CMM, author of Beacon on the Hill #### \"Seeing Patients is a powerful and extraordinarily important book, well writte n and easy to read.

His warm description of his family and community , challenges and supports, helps us understand the roots of his ow n character and determination. His insider view of good people negatively affected by forces th ey are often not even aware of, and the histori cal and experiential sources of those forces hel p us understand the complexity of bias, not only in medicine, but as a factor in the human condition.

Robert Wood Johnson Medical School PERSPECTIVE ARTICLE Some Advice for Minorities and Women on the Receiving End of Health-care Disparities Augustus A. White III Received: 9 October 2013 /Revised: 9 January 2014 /Accepted: 13 January 2014 /Published online: 12 Febr uary 2014 #Cobb/NMA Health Institute 2014 Abstract The pervasive, distressing realities of health-care dis- parities were well documented in the milestone publication by the Institute of Medicine in 2003. This work reviewed numero us articles published in peer-reviewed journals showing disp arities in health care for a number of groups in our society, includin g African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, Lat i- nos, and women. These disparities are caused by conscious an d subconscious bias, stereotyping, racism, and sexism in our soci- ety. Although not enough, there are numerous programs and activities designed to eliminate health-care disparities . Health literacy is one element that is helpful in improving anyone 's health care. For those who are at risk to experience health-c are disparities, a patient education program is thought to be he lpful, although presenting without evidence basis. If patients at risk for health-care disparities can be educated to have the knowled ge, skills, and attitudes to negotiate a system wrought with dis par- ities, this would be helpful in diminishing the existence of these disparities. Fifteen specific recommendations are offere d which together are expected to provide considerable help in dimin ishing health-care disparities in the at-risk patient population . A brief explanation of the reason and rationale for the recommendat ions is offered as needed. A presentation of the patient 's rights and responsibilities is provided to help patients cope in this c urrent medical environment. These rights and responsibilities ar e well- regarded examples of current best practices. Keywords Advice to patients .Health care disparities .

But given his legendary struggle for equality and fundamental human rights, it may seem a little odd that he would place inequality in health care at the very top of the list of injustices \u2014\" the most shocking and inhumane, \"as he put it. But think for a moment. When in the normal course of our lives, are we at our most vulnerable? When are we most frightened? When are we in most pain? The answer is \u2014when we are suffering from illness or injury. And it is exactly then that we must go for help to someone we may know only slightly or who may be a complete stranger to us. That person may come from a different culture; he or she might speak differently. If we are not native English speakers, we may have difficulty understanding what that person is telling us even at the most basic level. In the best of circumstances, he or she will be using a language we are likely not be very familiar with \u2014the language of medicine. We are faced with all these when we are in distress physically and, very likely, emotion- ally as well. It is in these difficult circumstances that injustice and inequality strikes most egregiously. Injustices in health care are commonly described as dispar- ities. These disparities are pervasive, and, sometimes, a h arsh reality for many of us. Peer review journals confirm a substa ntial inequality in health care for minorities and women in Americ a today. The infant mortality rate for Blacks is more than twic e that for whites [ 1]. African Americans receive fewer cardiac catheterizations [ 2], fewer angioplasties, fewer bypass surgeries [3], fewer kidney transplants [ 4], and fewer lung cancer surger- ies [ 5]. African Americans [ 6] and Hispanic Americans [ 7] with A. A.

Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (2014) 1:61 -66 DOI 10.1007/s40615-014-0011-9 fresh long bone fractures receive significantly less pain m edica- tion as compared with whites. In addition, pharmacies in pre - dominantly nonwhite neighborhoods of New York City do not stock sufficient medications to treat patients with severe pain adequately [ 8]. African Americans received fewer total joint replacements [ 9] and fewer procedures for open reduction and internal fixation of femoral fractures [ 10 ]. African Americans receive more hysterectomies [ 10 ,11 ], more amputations [ 12 ], and more bilateral orchiectomies [ 13 ]. The average American life expectancy in 2001 was 77.2 for African Americans, and whereas for whites, it was 77 years [ 14 ]. The death rate for nine of the top ten causes of death in America is at least 1.5 times greater for Blacks than for whites [ 1,15 ]. One might ask, \"Why is this? \"How can these realities be so striking, pervasive, extensive, and persistent? There are a number of factors behind such shocking facts. We know from research in psychology and other disciplines that unconscious bias is an ever present and powerful reality impacting many of our day-to-day decisions, large and small . Physicians are not exempt from this reality. Moreover, we kn ow that the likelihood of unconscious or subconscious factors affect- ing decision making is much greater for individuals under st ress [16 ], which typically include doctors. The list of \"doctor stressors \"is a long one: rushed schedules, sky-high debt burdens from medical school, the need to keep up with an avalanche of research and clinical studies, ever mounting medical insur ance costs, and that is the short list. As a result, physicians are espe- cially prone to the impact of the subconscious, which includ es biases that run beneath the surface and awareness of our ment al lives. And yes, some caregivers still carry conscious preju dices as they practice, though that may be reduced from what it used to be. There is another context in which health-care disparities occur. This has to do with a tendency for stereotyping on the part of caregivers. People have a propensity to stereotype; it is a universal human trait, and often damaging or dangerous for those who are stereotyped. \"Driving while Black \"is a danger. \"Being a patient while Black \"can be one, too. A third mechanism that can contribute to health-care dis- parities in the patient-doctor interaction is the harsh and still ubiquitous ambient racism [ 17 ]. Institutions, businesses, schools and other social environments incorporate in their practices histories of racial prejudices that remain, even given efforts to eliminate them. Clinics and hospitals are far from immune to these residual and difficult to extract biases [ 18 ]. Subconscious and conscious bias, stereotyping, and ambi- ent racism affect health care [ 19 ]. They are, simply, realities that minorities must take into account. These are discussed in detail in Seeing Patients: Unconscious Bias in Health Care [17 ]. Patients who are aware of this can proceed realistically in their interactions with the health-care system. The purpose of this awareness is not to create or magnify distrust, but to help develop practices that will result in the best possible outcomes when we need medical treatment or health maintenance. It is also good to remember that distrust on anyone 's part is a problem, patients 'as well as doctors '. One factor in the medical care equation is that patients, most especially in cross- cultural patient-doctor interactions and most especially when the patient is African American, do have a tendency for distrust. Doctors are aware of this. It is recognized in the medical literature; it comes up in doctors 'conversations with each other. The renowned African-American psychiatrist Dr. Price Cobbs famously said in his book, Black Rage [20 ], \"If you 're Black in America, and you 're not paranoid ...you must be crazy. \"But bringing any hint of paranoia with you into the examining room will not help produce good results. Remem- ber, doctors are as patients are. They will react to the way you treat them just as you react to the way they treat you. Hopefully this background will alert, focus, motivate, and help the reader to develop knowledge, attitudes, and skills that will result in a good outcome when the patient encounters caregivers in the current US health-care system. The intended outcome is for the patient to be alert, savvy, sophisticated, and wise, but not with a chip on the shoulder. A chip is not going to help get the kind of care that the patient deserves. The Advice Consider the following preamble. As with any human inter- action, one is encouraged to be polite, respectful, but also direct. Know your rights. In the patient-doctor encounter, remind yourself of the obvious: it is your health, perhaps your life, that is on the line, no one else 's. What you want is the very best care that you can get without any confrontation or hos- tility. We want you to be empowered because you do have rights as a patient, and you should be aware of them. We want to help you to be aware of them. You have a right as a patient to receive equitable care, to receive good care. You should not have to demand good equitable care, but you should get it by merely being present, pleasant, and cooperative. There are a number provisions in the US Constitution, federal civil rights statutes, state statutes, and professional association and accrediting standards that prohibit a hospital or doctor from discriminating against a patient based on race. To support this, you may cite the 14th Amendment (guaranteeing equal protection of law), title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , the reconstruction Civil Rights Acts, 42 U.S.C. Sections 1981.982 and 1983 \u2014among others. 1 &Read the general guidelines on \"Getting the Most Out of Your Doctor 's Visit \"[21 ]. 1Based on a consultation in Dec. 19, 2013 with Frank M.

Institutions collect this data, so that it will be possible to review the care received by various demographic groups: racial, ethnic, gender, and LGBT and others. This is important because it can uncov- er inequitable care when it occurs and hopefully lead to successful remedies. &Be sure to complete Patient Satisfaction forms. Such feedback is enormously important. Some institutions will give serious considerations to your response and will seek to improve when the patient interactions in which they can do better are pointed out. If they do not have your feedback, they will not have the incentive nor the information with which to address inequitable unsatisfactory care. &Networking is useful in two ways. First, it allows patients to learn the good and the bad about how they may be treated in a given facility. We, at-risk people, can often- times accurately sense conscious and unconscious bias on the part of caregivers. Networking activities can provide useful positive and negative feedback which can inform and incentivize the various treatment institutions. More- over, social media communications greatly facilitates the- se important communications, activities, and mechanisms. &Know your patients 'rights. Some health facilities publish a list of patients 'rights. Ask for a copy. If they are not published in the facility, you can find them online. See www.nationalhealthcouncil.org/ . &Become health literate. Here is one of the most important measures you can take: Study your symptoms and your disease(s) on WebMD or the Mayo Clinic.com website or some other reliable source of medical information and learn about your disease. This will help you to interact with your physician, ask questions more effectively, and get better care. &Ask questions. Ideally, write down your questions before you go into the physician 's office. If helpful, read them when you have the opportunity during the visit. If you do not have a chance to write them down, ask them anyway. When in doubt, in any patient-doctor interaction, if you are anxious or worried or confused, ask questions. Repeat: ask questions. &Do a \"teach back. \"This more structured way of asking questions can clarify your health status, the plan for ad- dressing issues, and help establish your role as an active participant in your care. At some point before the visit is over, say \"Doctor, may I just take a moment to see if I understand what my illness is, what we 're doing about my illness, and the reasons for what we 're doing? \"Then review the visit. \"Doctor, please let me see if I understand my problem and what we 're going to be doing to solve it. \" Then, tell the doctor. The doctor will then tell you if you got it right and correct you as and if needed. You will then explain things again to the doctor who will once again correct you if needed. This process (teach back) continues until it is clear that you understand the doctor 's instruc- tions and/or prescriptions. Some doctors have had training and are instructed to initiate this teach back activity. But remember, if the doctor does not initiate the teach back, you should initiate it. &If you sense a need, do what we call a \"reality check. \" True, we want to be cautious about our distrust, but if you sense, for whatever reason, that you are not receiving adequate care, that in fact, you are receiving disparate care, I repeat, for whatever reason \u2014whether it is because you encountered lack of attention, discourtesy, prejudice, disrespect \u2014we recommend the following. Relax, focus, look at the physician, and say, \"Doctor, I came here because of your reputation/the reputation of this facility as a place where I would receive good care. Doctor, I have to be frank and tell you that I feel that I 'm not receiving good care. I 'm not sure why. I 'm not sure if you have not treated African-American patients before, (or elderly pa- tients before, or seriously overweight patients before), but I feel somehow we 're not moving forward together and I'm not receiving the care I need and deserve. \" This can be done forthrightly and respectfully and is 100 % within your rights. If the doctor responds with an apology or some other positive response such as, \"That was not my intent, I do want to provide good care for you, \"that is a good outcome. You, the patient, may then say, \"Doctor, let 's move forward and see how we can work together effectively. \"If you, the patient, have a special specific complaint, then express that again or add that to what you have already said. If the doctor responds in an unconcerned, detached, offensive, or aggressive manner, then I think you should fill out your Doctor Satisfaction form and look for another doctor. If the doctor makes an attempt to adjust and expresses a desire to move forward and provide the care that you expected, then it makes good sense to continue with that doctor as long as you feel you are making progress. Again, this is entirely within your rights. Remember that it is your health that is on the line. You must advocate for yourself. &Try to humanize your doctor/your caregiver. This is some- thing we recommend physicians do as well when treating their patients, as an attempt to enrich the patient-doctor relationship and develop a more collaborative, cooperative partnership, which will result in more effective care. Two human beings, the caregiver and the patient, constitute this relationship. Any personal exchange can work toward establishing a human connection \u2014which is always help- ful in furthering the professional connection. Ask about family, children, grandchildren, or ask about the weather. If the doctor asks how you are, ask in turn how he or she is. Be interested. By all means seek to humanize your doctor. J. Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (2014) 1:61 -66 63 Doing that will help him or her to focus on you as a fellow human person. &Perhaps you can research your caregiver ahead of time, either online or through word of mouth. You may find you have things in common: maybe you are from the same city or region, perhaps you went to the same school, or to a similar church, maybe you played the same sports, or have a particular overlapping interest in art or music \u2014anything that you can relate to, however briefly, that engages expe- rience in common. &If you are comfortable sharing your health information, by all means, take a friend and/or a relative with you and ask the doctor if he or she is comfortable having your friend be present because it is important for you. That person is another set of ears. If what is going on is complicated, he or she might take notes or may simply remind you of things that you would like to include in your discussion with the doctor. It is a good check, and it lets the doctor know that at least one other person cares about you. This \"buddy visit \"tends to add confidence and security in any circumstances. &If you have a negative, unsatisfactory, unpleasant, inade- quate patient-doctor interaction, make sure to report the incident to someone in a supervisory capacity at the hos- pital or clinic, preferably in person or by telephone or by mail as a last choice. Report to the highest-ranking person you can contact. Simply explain your disappointment, report that you are upset, and explain the reason for it. This will not erase your experience, but it will give you a sense of satisfaction in that you are doing something about the problem, and in many instances, it will be helpful to your fellow patients as your complaint is addressed with by the institution and the caregiver involved. If not satis- fied, seek a facility with a better reputation for equitable care. &If surgery is in the picture and you are inclined toward surgery and your caregiver is pushing against it, get a second opinion. If you are inclined not to have a surgical procedure and your caregiver is pushing for you to have it, get a second opinion. Actually, if a major surgery is in the picture, get a second opinion regardless of your inclination to proceed or not. &If in any doubt or difficulty with English proficiency, ask about having an interpreter [ 21 ]. A Parting Observation You cannot control health policy for the nation nor for your local health facility. You cannot control health insurance. You cannot control the doctors, the nurses, or the staff in your health facility, but you can control yourself. The most important benefit of all to your health is your health literacy . And that is under your own control. Know as much as you can about your problem, your symptoms, and how you can most effectively interact with your health care provider! Hopefully some, if not all, of the suggestions made here will be helpful. Keep your chin up, keep your head up, keep your pride up, know your rights, and be assertive and persis- tent in search of collaborative mutually respectful arrange- ments with your caregivers. The following is the standard list of patient rights and responsibilities from the Beth Israel/Deaconess Medical Center, a Harvard Medical School teaching hospital [ 22 ]. Your Rights as a Patient [ 22 ] Our statement of patients 'rights, incorporating state and fed- eral law, describes the medical center 's commitment to protecting your rights. 1.

U.S. News & World Report has released its annual rankings -- with the Mayo Clinic topping for 2014 the site's honor roll list for the first time. The yearly analysis specifically looks at the best medical centers for patients with life-threatening or rare conditions. Factors such as patient survival rates, adequate nursing staff, reputation with specialist physicians and patient safety, which has more emphasis this year, are taken into account. \"U.S. News strives to provide patients and their families with the most comprehensive data available on hospitals,\" said Avery Comarow, U.S. News health rankings editor. \"With an estimated 400,000 deaths occurring in hospitals each year from medical errors, measuring safety performance is critical to understanding how well a hospital cares for its patients.\" Why you should try to avoid going to the hospital in July In addition to an overall ranking, the report also breaks down the best hospitals into 16 specialties, including the best hospitals for cancer and heart surgery. All the rankings can be viewed on . Highlights usnews.com include: Best overall hospitals 1. Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 2. Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 3.

Sullivan and Augustus A. White, III updated 11:12 AM EDT, Wed July 16, 2014 CNN.com Louis Sullivan is the Editor's note: president emeritus of Morehouse School of Medicine and Chairman and CEO of The Sullivan Alliance. He served as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services from 1989-1993. Augustus A. White is the Ellen and Melvin Gordon Distinguished Professor of medical education and a professor of orthopedic surgery at Harvard Medical School. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors. (CNN) -- Growing up in the Jim Crow-era South, we saw firsthand the great disparities in health care suffered by African-Americans. The lack of access to basic services, the dearth of black physicians and the often overtly racist attitudes of white health care providers contributed to higher rates of infant mortality, chronic illnesses and shorter life expectancy. The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., said that \"of all forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.\" But hasn't the prejudice that prevailed in those far off times been eliminated in today's more equitable society? Or do health disparities persist in less obvious but no less worrying ways -- and not just for African-Americans? Studies emphatically conclude that such disparities do persist. U.S. News and World Report released its latest issue on announcing the best hospitals in the nation Tuesday. People put a lot of stock in these rankings, and equality of treatment should be considered as a factor in what makes a hospital excellent. \"Unequal Treatment ,\" published by the Institute of Medicine in 2002, spelled out exactly how Latinos, African-Americans, Native-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Pacific Islanders receive care that's inferior to that enjoyed by mainstream Americans. The IOM report that demonstrated the triggered other studies (often unconscious) prejudice that prevails in treating women, the elderly, the LGBT community, the obese --13 groups in all -- a large percentage of the health care consuming public. Here are a few shocking examples: Women with symptoms of heart disease often are not transported by emergency medical services to health facilities as rapidly as men. Women and blacks with heart attack symptoms are not given cardiac catheterizations and other appropriate clinical tests at the same rate as white men. Latinos and African-Americans do not receive the same pain medication for long bone fractures as do their fellow citizens. Attacking health disparities head-on can make a big difference. A program in Alaska designed to train -- the rough equivalent of physician's assistants -- celebrated its 10th dental health care therapists anniversary this month. The Native Tribal Council initiated the program, Dentex, because the state had fewhttp://www.cnn.com/2014/07/15/opinion/sullivan-white-unequal-health-care-hospitals/index.html Page 2 of 2 Aug 29, 2014 02:06:30PM MDT See why these executives gave up bonusesanniversary this month. The Native Tribal Council initiated the program, Dentex, because the state had few dentists and most wouldn't accept Medicaid. Many native children lost all of their teeth by age 18, affecting their health, social lives, school attendance, and employment possibilities. The dental health aide therapists have improved oral health in Alaska dramatically. Now, despite the fierce , Maine and Minnesota have approved the training and opposition of the American Dental Association deployment of similar mid-level dental providers, and other states are considering it. It is widely accepted that African-Americans and Hispanics are underserved. Shortening the waiting times at Grady Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia -- which primarily serves African-American, Hispanic and other minority populations -- allowed greater access to mental health services because the population is admitted more quickly and provided with care. Hospitals would be encouraged to join the fight if equality were included as a metric in the U.S. News and World Report . These rankings are popular and closely watched. rankings They bestow bragging rights on hospitals, but most important, provide guidance for people deeply interested in where they might go to receive the best care in the specialties that concern them most. U.S. News and World Report has a tremendous opportunity to facilitate significant changes in health care delivery by rating hospitals for their care of the underserved. Its annual hospital rankings tell consumers nothing on this vital subject. Where do hospitals rank in their understanding of the problem of unequal care? What measures do they take to counteract the effects of prejudice in the treatment they provide? We encourage the publication to maximize this opportunity before next year's \"Best Hospitals\" issue. That would enable women and minorities to advocate for health care equality more successfully. It would help U.S. health professionals understand health disparities and more effectively treat underserved and minority populations. Most important, it would help all patients and their families, not just those who need not worry about disparities in care, to know better where to go for the care they need.

An interstate compact would also represent a departure from how medical boards have operated, in many cases, for over a century. Depending upon one's point of view, an interstate compact might conjure up different visions of the future. For some, the interstate compact offers a tested Constitutional precept that could creatively forestall federal intervention that might otherwise supplant the long-standing authority of state medical boards. The power of interstate compacts might also provide state boards with valuable new tools with which to do their work. For others, the possibility of other state boards licensing physicians who practice in their states, coupled with the establishment of new governmental organizations, leaves them uneasy at best. Dissenters also raise questions about how boards will obtain the necessary financing to do their work. This paper will show how the interstate compact is the best solution for adapting to the forces of current and future trends. With a common understanding of the utility and widespread use of the interstate compact, we will turn our attention to how it emerged as a viable option, key specifics of an interstate compact for medical licensure, and the extent to which the model that has been crafted by the FSMB can complement the existing authority of state medical boards. Origins of State-Based Physician Licensing Readers of this article, and of this journal, are likely to be familiar with important recent works on the history of medical regulation, such as Medical Licensure and Discipline in America, authored by David Johnson and Humayun Chaudhry (2012) and Ruth Horowitz's In the Public Interest: Medical Licensing and the Disciplinary Process (2013). Though it is not necessary to repeat the efforts of these and other authors, it is instructive for this ABSTRACT: The United States Constitution established and the Supreme Court has affirmed the proper role of states in regulating medicine throughout American history. However, the opportunities and mounting pressures of modern medical practice have called into question the viability of state-based regulation to address the increasing practice of physicians across state lines. This article will argue that the crossroads at which state medical boards find themselves provides an opportunity for an interstate compact as the best solution for adapting to the forces of current and future trends. A brief examination of the history of state-based licensing, and the dynamics that led up to the formation of the Federation of State Medical Boards will provide a basis for consideration of interstate compacts as a constructive response to critiques of the present regulatory structure. With a common understanding of the utility and widespread use of the interstate compact, we will turn our attention to how it emerged as a viable option, key specifics of an interstate compact for medical licensure, and the extent to which the model that has been crafted by the FSMB can complement the existing authority of state medical boards.The Interstate Medical Licensure Compact: AN INTERSTATE COMPACT OFFERS THE PR OSPECT OF T A k IN g A g IANT LEAP FORWARD IN E x PEDITED LICENSURE , A MEANS T O F ACILITATE MULTISTATE PRACTICE WITHIN A STATE - BASED LICENSIN g FRAMEWOR k.

JOURNAL of MEDICAL REGULATION VOL 100, NO 2, 2014 | 9 embracing new and better methods of testing, as a means to truly measure fitness for practice and not just factual recall. 10,11 Over time, state exami- nations gave way to national examinations \u2014 the NBME, the Federation Licensing Examination (FLEX), the National Boar d of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME)12 Examination, and ultimately, the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX-USA) \u2014 that pr omoted greater consistency in content and standards, in contrast to the variability of state examinations. 13 Although medical boar ds' initial focus was on the licensing of physicians, as time went on, public skepticism grew about how licensing (sometimes licensing for life) was protecting the public. Relatively few complaints resulted in professional discipline, and most often, these were in the realm of substance abuse or sexual or other misconduct, not substandard practice. In response, Dr. Walter Bierring called for boards to broaden their per-spective in the January 1960 Federation Bulletin: \" If a state cannot, or does not, for just cause, r evoke a license or discipline a physician...a fatal weakness exists. If no machinery exists for investigations and hearings...discipline does not really exist. If there is nothing beyond what the state or county society can do, a license to practice becomes a potential license for abuse.\" 14 Today, the range and volume of state medical board discipline has expanded greatly, with substandard practice comprising a significant percentage of the disciplinary work of boards. I n stark contrast to the stated mission of state medical boards to protect the public, for many years these boards were populated only by licensees. However in 1961, that changed for the first time with the appointment of one \"public member\" to the Medical Board of California. 15 This began a movement that has resulted in virtually all state medical boards having public member representation today; moreover, these members are not merely tolerated, but appreciated for bringing an important alternative perspective. As Horowitz notes \"[t]he idea that the public should have its own representatives on a board is generally accepted today, but it was once controversial.\" 16 In r ecent years, state medical boards have responded positively to license portability efforts discussion to underscore several key themes through highlighting specific historical episodes and milestones of the long history of state-based medical regulation. Efforts to regulate the practice of physicians predate the founding of the United States, with the earliest legislation dating to 1639 in the Virginia Colony, the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1649 and in New York in 1665. 1 Precursory state requirements to have a license issued through a medical society comprised of physician peers (such as New York in 1760 2, New Jersey in 17723, Pennsylvania in 17944, and Maryland in 17985) and to have an examination (New Jersey in 1772 and New York in 1797, for example) were commonplace. 6 However, between 1826 and 1852 nearly every state (except New Jersey) repealed laws requiring licensure of physicians, due primarily to consumer confusion and skepticism about the efficacy of the many types of physicians practicing in the day. Nevertheless, as a result of multiple effects, not the least of which were public sanitation and scientific advances, states gradually established (or reestablished) licensing boards and independent examinations of their own by 1910. 7,8,9 In other words, even prior to the nation's founding, the basic infrastructure of how we regulate physicians at the state level emerged, and it has since evolved into a model (well over a century ago) that is easily recognizable as similar to what universally exists in the U.S. today. How state medical boards have responded to changes in their operating environment, including the expectations placed on them by the public and key stakeholders can be easily illustrated: While the founding of the National Boar d of Medical Examiners (NBME) in 1915 might have hastened movement toward a more unified examination process for medical students, states only gradually gave up the use of their own licensing examinations.

All Rights Reserved. 10 | JOURNAL of MEDICAL REGULATION VOL 100, NO 2, 2014License Reciprocity and the Formation of the Federation of State Medical Boards It is well known by many in the field of medical regulation that the Federation of State Medical Boards resulted from the 1912 merger of the National Confederation of State Medical Examining and Licensing Boards (National Confederation) and the American Confederation of Reciprocating Examining and Licensing Boards (American Confederation). What may be less broadly understood is that the issues of license reciprocity and barriers to physician mobility across state lines were pivotal to the fracture of the National Confederation and the creation of the American Confederation a decade earlier. 22,23,24 At the heart of the American Confed- eration's mission was to create a national examining board to help eliminate obstacles to interstate practice. Shryock also describes the \"continued efforts of the Reciprocity Confederation\" during this period \"to encourage inter-board agreements.\" 25 However, due to the practical constraints of limited financial resources for both organizations, combined with a public perception that two contending organizations did not serve the public interest, leaders from the organizations began merger discussions in 1910 and, on February 28, 1912, the National Confederation and the American Confederation adopted a constitution and by-laws creating the Federation of State Medical Boards. 26,27 A more nuanced understanding of the schism between the two organizations illustrates that the difficult questions of how to license and regulate physicians at the state level, yet allow movement of medical practice across state lines, have eluded leaders in this field for over 100 years and continue to resonate in today's debates. Interestingly, Johnson and Chaudhry speak to the public's expec-tations of the role of that newly-formed FSMB: Looking back, these aspirations for a broadly influential Federation while flattering and well intentioned, expected perhaps too much from the fledgling organization. In some ways and at a fundamental level, writers such as those led by the FSMB. Sixty-seven of 69 state medical boards that engage in licensing activities now accept or require the FSMB's Federation Credentials Verification Service, which provides a centralized process for boards to obtain primary source verified physician records for credentialing. 17 Twenty-two states use the FSMB's Uniform Appli-cation, which standardizes and simplifies the licensure application process for physicians. 18 In r esponse to growing sentiment that better communication between states was needed to prevent physicians from using increased mobility to evade detection, medical boards began to rely on databases such as the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and the FSMB's Physician Data Center as a part of their licensing activities. The NPDB, for example, was created in 1986 with the express purpose of \"encouraging State licensing boards, hospitals and other health care entities, and professional societies to identify and discipline those who engage in unprofessional behavior, and to restrict the ability of incompetent physicians...to move from State to State without disclosure or discovery of previous...adverse action history.\" 19 Today, reporting to these databases, and checking them during the licensure process, is a commonplace activity for state boards. It is true that the earliest licensing efforts in this country may have been aimed more at securing reimbursement for physicians than the virtue of patient safety, and that the repeal of many laws during the mid-nineteenth century reflected inter-professional squabbles, along with a dose of public suspicion. Nevertheless, with respect to the re-establishment of medical licensing, Horowitz notes \"[t]he fact that legislatures first granted licensure to occupations concerned with health and cleanliness confirms a vital link between the successes of licensure and the public health movement.\" 20 Further, she states that \"[w]ith the onset of the Progressive era, it was common for physicians to mention patients as main beneficiaries of the licensure policies advanced by medical societies.\" 21 These statements are powerful in that they not only capture the essence of why state medical boards were created and exist to this day, but that respon-sible physicians themselves recognize the value of state medical boards as a means of ensuring the safety of their patients and the general public. State boards have not wavered from that overarching mission, yet their responsibilities and activities continued to evolve through the twentieth century.AT THE HEAR T OF THE A MERICAN C ONFEDERATION ' S MISSION WAS TO CREA TE A NATIONAL E x AMININ g BOARD T O HELP ELIMINA TE OBSTACLES T O INTERSTATE PRACTICE .

JOURNAL of MEDICAL REGULATION VOL 100, NO 2, 2014 | 11 Two U.S. Supreme Court rulings were critical in reinforcing the doctrines laid out in the Tenth Amendment.32 In the first, Dent v. West Virginia, Frank Dent, an eclectic physician challenged the authority of West Virginia due to failing to meet state licensing standards. In 1889, stating the unanimous opinion of the court, Justice Field said in part: \"Few professions require more careful preparation by one who seeks to enter it than that of medicine. It has to deal with all those subtle and mysterious influences upon which health and life depend...Reliance must be placed upon the assurance given by his license, issued by an authority compe-tent to judge in that respect, that he possesses the requisite qualifications. Due consideration, therefore, for the protection of society may well induce the State to exclude from practice those who have not such a license, or who are found upon examination not to be fully qualified.\" 33 A decade later, in 1898, in Hawker v. New York, Dr. Benjamin Hawker had been previously convicted of a felony and served jail time, after which he sought to resume his medical practice. However, the State of New York had, in the interim, passed laws prohibiting felons from practicing medicine, and Dr. Hawker was again convicted under these laws, which form the basis for many \"good moral character\" provisions in current licensing laws. Writing for the majority, Justice Brewer stated \"...it is insisted that within the acknowledged reach of the police power, a State may prescribe the qualifi-cations of one engaged in any business so directly affecting the lives and health of the people as the practice of medicine...we are of opinion that this argument is the more applicable and must control the answer to the question.\" 34,35 The Tenth Amendment remains a cornerstone upon which the state regulation argument, such as that for physician practice, is built; nevertheless, the debate rages today as to whether Congressional action in recent decades has, in practical terms, eroded its strength. Its federalist canons are from Harper's and the Times misunderstood the true nature and authority of the Federation. They seemed to conflate an annual gathering of representatives from individual state gencies with a truly national body akin to a federal agency. 28 More than a century ago, there was an acknowledge-ment of the important issues of license reciprocity and physician mobility across state lines, even in an era before telehealth 29. In that day, the concern was to prevent unscrupulous physicians from fleeing across state borders. But the passage above also highlights an acknowledgement of the need and desire for interstate coordination, in a way that the Federation was not empowered to provide. Concurrently, the use of interstate compacts in the early 20th century was beginning to evolve, but they did not yet possess the mechanisms to accommo-date ongoing and complex regulation, such as that of interstate medical practice. As we shall observe below, important changes in interstate compact design and use place us today at a unique confluence point in history, one where the need is there and the tool has developed to ideally suit the need. The Legal and Constitutional Context of State-Based Physician Regulation As we examine the history of state-based physician regulation as it relates to contemporary challenges, we would be remiss not to also briefly consider the constitutional and legal contexts in which state medical boards exist. The Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which embodies the principle of federalism, is generally the starting point for such conversation. The Tenth Amendment, which echoes language from Article II of the Articles of Confederation, reserves those powers not explicitly granted to the U.S. government to the states. 30 Derbyshire states the impacts of the Tenth Amendment plainly: \"the practice of medicine for many years has been regu-lated by the states; this policy will not change since the federal government cannot assume this function without an amendment to the Constitution.\" 31 The Ten Th Amendmen T rem Ains A corners Tone upon which T he s TAT e regul AT ion A rgumen T, such A s T h AT for phy sici A n pr Ac T ice, is buil T.more ThAn A cen T ury Ago , T here w A s A n Ackno wledgemen T of T he impor T A n T issues of license recipr oci T y A nd physici A n mobili T y Acr oss s TAT e lines, even in A n er A before T elehe A lT h.

All Rights Reserved. 12 | JOURNAL of MEDICAL REGULATION VOL 100, NO 2, 2014Federalism, and the Supreme Court's rulings reversed a decades-old pattern of accommodating federal preemption. Although the essence of cooperative federalism remains today in tools such as bloc and categorical grants to states, a tension continues to exist between Congress's more inter-governmental approach of cooperative federalism and the Supreme Court's more restrictive new federalism approach. The historical vicissitudes of federalist theory in the United States and the concomitant risks of federal preemption bear on the question of state regulation of physicians in at least two respects. First, the extent to which the regulation of medicine ceases to be a \"layer cake\" and becomes a \"marble cake\" is vitally important. Chemerinsky, in his assessment of the risks of federal overreach, cites Jonathan Tribe's remarks: \"no one expects Congress to obliterate the states at least in one fell swoop. If there is any danger, it has to be in the tyranny of small decisions.\" 45 Is it idle speculation to suggest that, when a sufficiently large health care regulatory portfolio has been created at the federal level (i.e., when the cake has become sufficiently \"marbled\"), this creates a clearer path to full federal preemption, and does it simultaneously make it harder for states to retain their sovereignty in those areas? Second, the potential implications are unclear of a national licensure scheme where sharing revenue with the state medical boards occurs, as it may present an opportunity to attach policy conditions to state regulation of physicians. A well cited example of this is the withholding of federal highway funds to states for not raising the legal state drinking age to 21 46. Moreover, the message in New York v. United States was not that federal funding could not be tied to the storage and disposal of low-level radioactive wastes, but that state regulatory authority may not be commandeered by the federal govern-ment. 47,48 It is conceivable then that, as part of partial preemption of physician licensing, the federal government could seek to leverage its control over state medical boards via a modified form of conditional spending power. 49 According to Learner, if a critical mass of states forges a policy consensus on a policy issue, \"courts should apply the Supremacy Clause with more restraint.\" 50 His assertion is more narrowly in the context of federal preemption of environmental regulation, yet it is well worth contemplating whether the message is the same \u2014 that is, a show of solidarity in r esolving the policy question of often described through three touchstone concepts: enacting limitations on the power of the federal government in order to protect against tyranny, placing the locus of governance as close as practi-cable to the people, and fostering innovation in governance at the state level. 36,37 However, how Congress and the Supreme Court have interpreted the core tenets of federalism over our nation's history have shifted significantly. For most of our national existence, federalism has been structured as a \"layer cake\" with distinct and separate roles for federal and state governments, also known as dual federalism. These distinctions were preserved by the courts, through common law rulings, but with a series of Supreme Court decisions in 1937 and 1938, an era of greater federal pre - emption began with the New Deal and lasted for nearly six decades. During this time, the Supreme Court simultaneously shrank its own role in preserving federalism via common law to mere interpretation and allowed that of Congress to expand. 38,39,40 This is most explicitly illustrated in the 1985 Garcia ruling where, writing for the majority, Justice Blackmun questioned whether the Court could even define what activities are so within the sphere of state regulation as to be exempted from federal regulation. 41,42 This loosening of Congressional restraint manifested itself as cooperative federalism, where the federal government sets a broad policy direction yet allows states flexibility and creativity in how to implement and administer program requirements, and it resulted in the expansion of federal regulation in a number of new areas. It also gave rise to a more coercive federalism, where the federal government sought to impose policies via regulatory mandates, funding restrictions and/or federal preemption. While President Reagan heralded a new relationship between a more limited federal government (i.e., his pronouncement that \"government is the problem\") and the states in the early 1980's, cooperative federalism abruptly ended, at least from the perspective of the Supreme Court, with New York v. United States in 1992. 43,44 The ruling solidified New For most o F our national existence, F ederalism has been structured as a 'layer cake' with distinct and separate roles F or F ederal and state governments also known as dual F ederalism.

JOURNAL of MEDICAL REGULATION VOL 100, NO 2, 2014 | 13 Census numbers indicate the U.S. population will grow by over 85 million to 400 million, and the over-65 population, which statistically tends to use more health care services, will nearly double from 43.1 million to 83.7 million, or more than 20 percent of the overall population. 54 Yet another factor that will affect the public's future utilization of health care is the growing prevalence of chronic disease, responsible for seven out of ten deaths in the U.S. in 2010, and of \"lifestyle\" conditions, such as obesity, which afflicts more than one-third of adults. 55 At the same time, a shortage of physicians and other health care professionals is anticipated, which is likely to be exacerbated in certain clinical specialties and in certain geographic areas, especially rural and underserved communities. The Association of American Medical Colleges has estimated for some time that the nation will face a shortage of more than 90,000 MDs by 2020 and more than 130,000 by 2025. 56 Moreover, the maldistribution of physicians in the United States has been well documented, both through research and through federal reimbursement policy. 57,58,59 The interrelated issues of physician training and reimbursement also guide where and in what spe-cialties physicians practice. The CRS report states that \"some specialties, such as general surgery, geriatrics, the pediatric subspecialties, and psychia-try, have...widely acknowledged shortages.\" 60 In addition, a 2009 study by the Robert Graham Center noted that \"[c]urrent U.S. graduate interest falls short of maintaining the current proportion of primary care in the physician workforce...This loss in production of primary care physicians may join the problem of maldistribution and further erode access to primary care services.\" 61 The relationship of medical school debt to selection of medical specialty is complex and not clearly determined, but there is evidence to demonstrate that post-educational salary does strongly correlate to choice of specialty. 62 Further, it has been chronicled by the Council on Graduate Medical Education that \"[n]othing affects the location decision of a physician more than specialty. Unfortunately for rural areas, the more highly specialized the physician, the less likely it is the physician will settle in a rural area,\" 63 a conclusion echoed by Rosenblatt and Hart.64 For some physicians, the costs, professional challenges and/or lifestyle limitations of service in rural or underserved areas may be decisive in their choice of practice location and specialty. 65 These elements in turn bear directly on the ease or difficulty of the population accessing medical care. 66 interstate physician licensure at the state level, using a Constitutionally-authorized tool like an interstate compact, should carry weight with Congress and, if necessary, the courts. The \"chaotic, con flicting, and rather r udimentary\" Tenth Amendment jurisprudence51, and the accom- panying uncertainty of whether federal mandates will come to states cloaked in full preemption, partial preemption, collective federalism, and/or constraints on federal licensing revenue, beg the question of whether states are better off to simply embrace the pure federalist spirit to operate as policy laboratories and proactively fill in the policy gap themselves. State medical boards' fiat derives both from the U.S. Constitution and from their longevity of operation. State medical boards and their predecessors have functioned in America as regulators of physician practice since the mid-17th century. This structure has been firmly underwritten by the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and has been reinforced by the U.S. Supreme Court. These provide a solid foundation to argue that maintaining the regulatory structure for physicians through state boards is reasonable. Yet those associated with state medical regulation would be unwise to stop here, as the complex and changeable landscape of federalism suggests. Additional compelling argu-ments, beyond mere historical or Constitutional entitlement, are warranted. Emerging \u2014 and Emergent \u2014 Forces on State Medical Boards The first sentence of the 2013 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, \"Physician Supply and the Affordable Care Act,\" plainly states the relationship between physician supply and patient care: \"[a]n adequate physician supply is important for the effective and efficient delivery of health care services and, therefore, for population health and the cost and quality of health care.\" 52 Consider that the Affordable Care Act projects that 32 million newly-insured Americans will enter the health care marketplace by 2019. 53 The nation also continues to grow older and more populous. By 2050, U.S. state medical boards' Fiat derives both F rom the u. s . c onstitution and F rom their longevity o F operation.

All Rights Reserved. 14 | JOURNAL of MEDICAL REGULATION VOL 100, NO 2, 2014However, a common misconception persists among proponents of the broader use of telemedicine, as a means to facilitate the multistate practice of medicine, that state medical boards oppose the use of technology. Although this is untrue, many are concerned that the unchecked spread of tele-medicine may endanger patients. The practice of telemedicine, in whatever the form, is still the practice of medicine, and the same care and protection must be afforded patients whether they are being seen by their community primary care doctor or a highly-focused specialist from across the country. This is the charge state legislatures have given to state medical boards \u2014 to ensur e that the public in their jurisdictions have access to competent medical care, not unfettered access, lacking the proper accountability. Unfortunately, some critics of state-based medical regulation have sought to portray medical boards as the source of the problem. In some cases, these critics are major corporations that appear to have vested interests in promoting the proliferation of technology in the health care system. 74 The American Telemedicine Association (ATA), a leading organization in the advocacy of telemedicine, represents a large number of corporate communications and telehealth interests, 75 and the ATA has repeatedly called for Congressional action to preempt state regulatory authority for medicine. In 2011, the ATA launched a website, fixlicensure.org, to elicit public support for this policy position, stating that \"requiring health providers to obtain multiple state licenses and adhere to diverse and sometimes conflicting state medical practice rules, is a barrier to progress, quality, com - petition and economy . This partitioned approach also presents a concern for patient safety as state-by-state licensing and enforcement inhibits tracking down and disciplining bad doctors located in other states.\" 76 The Chief Executive Officer of the ATA, Jonathan Linkous, has further expounded on the alleged failings of state licensure on a number of occasions, stating that \"we estimate it costs about $300 million a year to do extra licenses...that's growing Taken together, the above factors paint a picture of more Americans, more insured Americans, and more elderly Americans taxing our health care system in the years to come. In tandem, despite more physicians entering the workforce every day, evidence suggests there may not be enough, in the right specialties, or in the needed geographic locations, to meet all patients' needs. As the final gatekeeper to physician practice in the U.S., state medical boards are an essential ingredient in inno-vatively connecting physicians with patients. A second force reshaping medicine, and the expectations around how it is delivered, is the exponential expansion of technology in health care. As in most every other aspect of modern life, the ubiquity of technology has fundamentally reshaped the practice of medicine. Plumbing the foundations of human existence through gene and stem cell therapies, implanting wireless devices that monitor and regulate vitals, operating artificial limbs with thought-controlled pressure sensors, performing simulated and robotic surgery, and accessing electronic health records and health information exchanges are but a few examples of how technology has altered how physicians care for patients. Consider that, as of 2012, more than 13,000 health-related apps were available for download at Apple's Appstore. 67 In addition, Healthcare IT News reported earlier this year that \"[m]ore than half of people with chronic conditions say the ability to get their electronic medical records online outweighs the potential privacy risks.\" 68 But perhaps no other aspect of technology has broader transformational potential to provide high quality and more accessible care to patients than telemedicine. Telemedicine is often seen as a remedy to geographic and access barriers by allowing patients the freedom to directly seek out specialists who may practice remotely, facilitating virtual staffing of rural health care facilities, and allowing physicians in centers of excellence to treat and consult on patient care without the time and expense of arranging face-to-face patient visits. Using telemedicine to care for pediatric patients in the ER 69, placing technology on board ambulances to facilitate treatment en route to hospitals70, delivering eye care in rural and underserved areas of India71, using Google Glass to display information and digitally record surgical procedures 72, and remotely treating hepatitis C virus infection in underserved communities73 are but a few examples of how the advent of technology in patient care across state lines seems destined to rapidly accelerate into the future.as the Final gatekeeper to physician pra ctice in the u. s ., state medical boards are an essential ingredient in innovatively connecting physicians with patients.

JOURNAL of MEDICAL REGULATION VOL 100, NO 2, 2014 | 15 Still, these voices have been heard by lawmakers. A litany of bills considered or passed by Congress in recent years reflects a trend toward the gradual erosion of states' responsibilities: 82 HR 1832 \u2014 the STEP Act. Introduced on May 11, 2011 by Rep. Glenn Thompson (R-PA), this bill expanded the current Department of Defense state licensure exemption for credentialed health care professionals, regardless of where they or patients are located. This expansion includes civilian employees of the Department of Defense, personal services contractors, and other health care professionals credentialed and privileged at a Federal health care institution. The bill became law on December 31, 2011. HR 1540 \u2014 2012 National Defense Authorization Act. Intr oduced on April 14, 2011 by Rep. Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon (R-CA), the bill authorized Department of Defense civilian employees and other health care professionals credentialed and privileged at a federal health care institution or location designated by the Secretary of Defense to practice at any location, regardless of where the health care professional or patient are located, so long as the practice is within the scope of authorized federal duties. The bill became law on December 31, 2011. HR 6179 \u2014 The T elehealth Promotion Act of 2012. Intr oduced on December 30, 2012 by Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA), the bill would redefine telehealth services as originating from the site of the treating provider and not the patient. This stance on the location of physician practice has traditionally been viewed as incon - sistent with how medicine is defined and as contrar y to patient safety. HR 6107 \u2014 The VETS Act. Intr oduced on July 12, 2012 by Rep. Charles Rangel (D-NY) the bill would allow any licensed health care professional employed in the VA system, either employed or contracted, regardless of state of licensure, to practice in any facility nationally through the use of telemedicine. HR 3077 \u2014 The TELE-MED Act of 2013. Intr oduced on September 2013 by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), the bill would allow for a Medicare provider, licensed in one state, to treat any Medicare bene - ficiar y in any other state via telemedicine without requiring licensure where the patient is located. The bill currently has 58 bipartisan co-sponsors. The ATA has voiced strong support for this bill. 83because physicians are increasingly holding mul-tiple medical licenses. It's an access problem.\" 77 He has been quoted as saying \"the patchwork of state-by-state licensing creates a mire of costly red tape and has become an untenable barrier for both providers and patients.\" 78 Mr. Linkous has further opined \"It is wrong to deny a patient health care because of state boundaries and overly cumbersome state licensing rules.\" 79 As recently as March 10, 2014, Mr. Linkous pro-vided testimony to the Federal Trade Commission on telemedicine and competition. 80 In it, he indicated that the ATA did not necessarily oppose state-based regulation, but warned that any proposed alternative must be \"accomplished without delay and with a specific timeline included for implementation.\" Mr. Linkous's testimony referenced an interstate compact model but detailed ATA's concern that, after 15 years in existence, the Nurse Licensure Compact only operates in 24 states, implying that only a true national solution is acceptable to his organization. Ultimately, Mr. Linkous reprised the tenor of his earlier statements, saying that state-based licensure requirements are \"costly and serve as a barrier to fair competition. Licensure costs professionals and the taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Separate licensing is without justification for clinical services that do not require face-to-face interactions such as the interpretation of images or peer-to-peer consultations.\" 81 It remains unclear whether the motivation for orga-nizations such as the ATA to preempt the states in favor of a federal solution for physician licensure is purely financial, or a true belief that the access to be gained through federal action outweighs any collateral damage to patient safety, or a combina- tion of the two. At the very least, such statements demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of the vital role of state medical boards by implying that the current system does not work.State medical board S have been vocal S upporter S of re S pon S ibly u S ing telemedicine technologie S to expand acce SS , e S pecially in rural and under erved area S .

N ot introduced, this bill authored by Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) in 2011 would initially create a voluntary national license, issued in tandem with a state license, which would allow physicians to practice across state lines. This system would transition to a mandatory system for physicians accepting Medicare or Medicaid payment, and would eventually be expanded to all types of health care providers. The bill would reserve investigation of complaints and discipline to the states, but the bill does not stipulate how these activities would be paid for. 84 There is little to dispute about the many potential benefits of the use of technology in the delivery of health care. Weighing the implications of how our population's demographics and geography drive utilization of health care, or how the economics of medical education and reimbursement shape not merely how doctors practice but in what specialties they choose to practice, also does not dispute the myriad possibilities of technology in serving the health care needs of the public. Finally, it is critical to reemphasize that mere identification of the troubling aspects of legislative proposals or stakeholder critiques should not and does not constitute a de facto indictment of either telemedicine or interstate practice. State medical boards have been vocal supporters of responsibly using telemedicine technologies to expand access, especially in rural and underserved areas. However, state medical boards must also recognize that the statements of influential critics, proposed \u2014 and enacted \u2014 federal bills, and changes in technology, demographics and financing, all represent fundamental challenges to how they have operated for decades. By natural extension, should the boards choose not to adapt to changing conditions and expectations, these elements can pose risks to the ability of state medical boards to continue their enduring public protection mission. As Ameringer counsels, \"If state medical boards fail to put aside their differences and create a uniform approach to regulating the practice of medicine across state lines, the federal government would have cause to intervene.\" 85 How then might state medical boards operationalize Ameringer's advice? Interstate Compacts: A Primer The purpose of this article is twofold. Thus far its focus has been to set out how state medical boards have historically safeguarded the public through the licensure and discipline of physicians, and to describe how this role is consistent with federal legal and constitutional principles. In response to a rapidly changing landscape within health care prompted by technology, multistate medical practice and evolving consumer expectations, the remainder of this inquiry will center on the concept of an interstate compact for physician licensure, how it has been developed and why it is the ideal mechanism to meet these challenges. To evaluate the compact mechanism, it is necessary to gain a working understanding of how compacts exist. Broun, Buenger, McCabe, and Masters, in The Evolving Use and the Changing Role of Interstate Compacts: A Practitioner's Guide, provide what may be the quintessential \"elevator\" speech for the utility of interstate compacts: [C]ompacts can effectively preempt federal interference into matters that are traditionally within the purview of the states but that have regional or national implications. Unlike federal actions that impose unilateral, rigid mandates, administrative compacts afford states the opportunity to develop dynamic, self-regulatory systems over which the member states can maintain control through a coordinated legislative and administrative process. The very nature of an interstate compact makes it an ideal tool to meet the need of cooperative state action... 86 Multiple factors contribute to the merit of interstate compacts as a means of collective state governance. First, despite the relative obscurity of interstate compact law in the field of jurisprudence, its bedrock lies squarely in the U.S. Constitution, and the forerunners of interstate compacts even precede the nation's founding. The Constitutional authority of compacts uniquely suits them to resolving statutory and regulatory differences between states, and they have been successfully applied across the gamut of regulation. Furthermore, inter-the c on S titutional authority of compact S uniquely S uit S them to re S olving S tatutory and regulatory difference S between S tate S , and they have been S ucce SS fully applied acro SS the gamut of regula tion.

JOURNAL of MEDICAL REGULATION VOL 100, NO 2, 2014 | 17 consent is an obstacle to establishing a compact. Although it might imply this, according to the Council of State Governments, \"[t]o clear up the ambiguity of the Compact Clause, the U.S. Supreme Court in Virginia v. Tennessee held that Congress must approve only two types of compacts: those compacts that alter the balance of political power between the state and federal government; or those compacts that intrude on a power reserved to Congress.\" 93 Others have similarly noted that Congressional consent may be implicit or explicit, depending on whether the compact would have a bearing on the balance of federal/state powers as laid out in the Constitution. 94,95,96 Congress's consent to an interstate compact can be either prospective or after a compact has already been established. Congress also has the authority to deny or withhold its consent to any interstate compact that it believes would violate either the federally-enumerated powers test or the federal-state balance of power test. However, a threat of withdrawal or denial is, practically speaking, extremely remote. 97 Indeed, especially in regard to the regulation of physicians, this article has laid out multiple reasoned arguments for it to remain within the domain of the states. A final note regarding the issue of Congressional Consent relates to what becomes of compacts, and the interstate organizations created by them, when formal consent is given. The answer, in operational terms, is absolutely nothing. Only in one respect does having formal consent \"transform\" the compact into federal law. As Justice Brennan wrote for the majority in the 1981 Supreme Court case Cuyler v. Adams, \"[b]ecause congressional consent transforms an interstate compact within this Clause into a law of the United States, we have held that the construction of an interstate agreement sanctioned by Congress under the Compact Clause presents a federal question.\" 98 Thus, unlike any other type of federal legislation, compacts with consent are state compacts have adapted over time to address progressively more challenging public policy issues. Finally, in contrast to anxiety over a perceived erosion of state sovereignty, the long history of compacts demonstrates that the benefits for states far outweigh any loss of authority. Ironically, interstate compacts are widely used in American government and yet are not well understood by the general public. 87 At the same time, interstate compacts are one of the oldest forms of cooperative government. As with the history of medical regula-tion in the United States, the history and use of compacts dates to colonial times, where they were used for boundary settlement negotiations where land charters were vague or incorrect. When appointed parties forged an agreement, it was then submitted to the Crown for approval. 88 Indeed, in the 1838 United States Supreme Court case Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, Justice Baldwin, writing for the Court, hearkens back to \"the Crown of England to the Plymouth Company in 1621; to Massachusetts in 1629; to Rhode Island in 1663; the new charter to Massachusetts in 1691; together with sundry intermediate proceedings of the council of Plymouth.\" 89 This framework remains the basis for interstate compacts today. Compacts are a hybrid of contract law and statutory law that states are specifically authorized to use under the \"Compact Clause\" of the U.S. Constitution (Article 1, Section 10, Clause 3): \" No State shall, without the Consent of Congr ess, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.\" (emphasis added) 90 Compacts are unique in American governance in that they rely on the premise of states' rights, yet they exist between state and federal authority. Because states enter into a contractual relationship with other states via the passage of state legislation, once entered, the terms of a compact cannot be changed unless agreed to by all the member states of the compact. 91 As a result, the authority of compacts supersedes that of state laws, rules, courts, and even state constitutional provisions, unless specifically exempted. 92 The question is often asked of whether the Compact Clause requires Congress to affirmatively consent to every compact, or whether the lack of explicit compacts are a hybrid o F contract la w and statutory law that states are speci F ically authorized to use under the ' c ompact c lause' o F the u. s . c onstitution ( a rticle 1, JournalMedReg_Vol100_2_r3.indd 17 7/18/14 2:15 PMCopyright Federation of State Medical Boards. All Rights Reserved. 18 | JOURNAL of MEDICAL REGULATION VOL 100, NO 2, 2014\"federalized\" only in that they fall exclusively within the jurisdiction of federal courts and enjoy protection against attacks on Constitutional grounds. 99 An indication of the true significance of interstate compacts is that disputes arising from compacts are one of the few areas where the United States Supreme Court may exercise original jurisdiction. 100,101 As a result, there is an important body of U.S. Supreme Court case law related to interstate compacts, including some of the most important cases the High Court has heard. One such case, relating to the enforceability of interstate compacts, is West Virginia ex. Rel. Dyer v. Sims in 1951. The case involved a dispute in West Virginia as to whether or not a payment of $12,250 to support the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Compact represented an illegal (per West Virginia's Constitution) delegation of the state's police power to other states and the federal government. Edgar B. Sims, the state's auditor, refused to issue the warrant to pay for the compact's expenses. 102 Writing the majority opinion, Justice Felix Frankfurter found the compact to be a \"conventional grant of legislative power\" and that the language of the compact, in which states agree to appropriate funds for its administrative expenses, did not represent a conflict with the West Virginia Constitution. 103,104 Justice Reed, in a concurring opinion specifically noted that \"under the Compact Clause...the federal questions are the execution, validity, and meaning of federally approved state compacts. The interpretation of the meaning of the compact controls over a state's application of its own law through the Supremacy Clause, and not by any implied federal power to construe state law.\" 105,106 An especially important feature of interstate com-pacts, for the purposes of this discussion, is the evolution of compacts in the 20th century to include governmental organizations for ongoing regulation. This occurred as a result of interstate compacts not having the necessary tools to respond to changing conditions and complexities, as well as not being able to effectively enforce the provisions of compacts with member states. The New York/New jersey Port Authority, created by a bi-state compact in 1921, was significant in that it was the first interstate government agency created in the western hemisphere and was the first inter-state agency created by interstate compact. 107 In more recent times, ongoing regulatory agencies have become fixtures in interstate compacts. In some cases, existing compacts have even been renegotiated to incorporate interstate commissions, such as with the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, the Interstate Compact on Juveniles, and the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children. 108 It must be acknowledged that, for some, the notion of \"giving\" away the authority of state boards to their associates in other states, or to an interstate commission, is disquieting. That state-specific laws or rules may be overridden by an interstate compact mechanism gives rise to visions of \"big brother\" for skeptics. There is an undeniable relinquishing of some individual board autonomy to participate in a compact. Further, because the compact is intended to create uniform standards and processes across all states that enact it, it cannot by definition accommodate all the individual regulatory nuances of any given member state. However, it is also undeniable that, at present, state boards have no true jurisdiction over physicians who are licensed elsewhere, even when it is their states' patients who are harmed by them. State laws do not give boards the ability to reach beyond those governed by their licensing statutes to investigate or take action on physicians providing unsafe or improper care from afar. The compact mechanism, however, gives states the authority to collectively act in a way that individual states, relying solely on their individual authority, cannot. Broun, Buenger, McCabe, and Masters further evaluate the trade-offs of individual versus collective state authority: As for concerns related to the loss of individual state sovereignty, there is no question that the parties to interstate compacts necessarily give up the right to unilaterally control the joint agencies they create. But when measured against the nature of congressional intervention and the loss of authority that can result from federal preemption of a particular field, the state legislative and regulatory control that states jointly retain under interstate compacts is usually preferred by states.

JOURNAL of MEDICAL REGULATION VOL 100, NO 2, 2014 | 19 \"convene and charge Member Boards with defining and developing a set criteria of qualifications for a Platinum Standard Certification, and a system to allow State Medical Boards to make rapid licensing available to the highest caliber of licensed physi-cians by September 1, 2012.\" 112 The intent of the resolution was that states, in collective examination of their licensing standards, could establish a \"highest common denominator\" of requirements and, if a physician were to qualify for the Platinum Standard and be licensed by one state, other coordinating states could then license him or her based on that distinction, without further evaluation. Resolution 12-4 was initially defeated in the House of Delegates, in part based upon apprehension that such a designation would connote a two-tiered system of physicians. However, further floor action revived the resolution in a different form, referring the question of a Platinum Standard to the Board of Directors for study and a report back to the House of Delegates in 2013, which passed the House. 113 The FSMB Board of Directors subsequently referred the matter for consideration to the FSMB Advisory Council of Board Executives, a standing group of state medical board executive directors. The Advisory Council engaged in extensive debate on the Platinum Standard Model at its August 2012 meeting, yet it came to the same subdued conclusion as had the FSMB House of Delegates. Nevertheless, the Council remained in clear con-sensus that, as Resolution 12-4 stated, \"a national trend [was] rapidly emerging, whereby state and federal policymakers [were] questioning the validity of the current state-based licensure system.\" 114 This recognition prompted the Council in that meeting toward exploration of a number of other alternatives. This included an initial conceptual discussion of a multistate license, possibly offered through an interstate compact. In order to further delve into these alternatives, the FSMB, in coordination with Administrators in Medicine, hosted a meeting in January 2013 for the purpose of examining existing state licensure processes and exploring innovative licensure approaches that could facilitate multistate practice. The meeting, which included representatives of 48 of the 69 licensing boards in the United States and its territories, was intended to move forward a more concrete discussion of one or several models that boards could pursue to better accommodate the practice of medicine across state lines, including via telemedicine.agency is more likely to be seen as a welcome protection of 'collective state sovereignty' than it is to be resisted as an unacceptable sacrifice of individual state authority. 109 Interstate compacts have been widely applied in the history of American government, with more than 200 active compacts, including 22 truly national ones. The average U.S. state is a party to 25 interstate compacts. 110 They have evolved in their form and application throughout American history and are effectively employed for purposes as varied as boundary disputes, resource management, taxes, insurance, criminal justice, health care, education, emergency management, transit, and economic development. Indeed, as Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter noted, \"that a legislature may delegate to an administrative body the power to make rules and decide particular cases is one of the axioms of modern government.\" 111 More than sufficient evidence exists to reasonably infer that compacts can be just as effective for the regulation of physician practice across state lines. The Interstate Medical Licensure Compact \u2014 Origins, Development, and Key Themes The antecedents to development, or even con - s ideration, of an interstate compact for physician licensure began some years ago. The FSMB has been engaged in activities for a considerable period to promote expedited licensure and to facilitate practice in multiple states. It is also clear from the above discussion that both Congressional activity and stakeholder interest in telehealth and multi-state practice were well underway by 2012. For the purposes of this discussion, however, we will focus on the most immediate events, beginning with a 2012 resolution to the FSMB House of Delegates from the Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine. Resolution 12-4, dubbed the Platinum Standard Model, directed the Federation to INTERSTATE COMPACTS HAVE BEEN WIDEL y APPLIED IN THE HISTOR y OF A MERICAN g OVERNMENT , WITH MORE THAN 200 A CTIVE COMPACTS , INCLUDIN g 22 TR ULy NA TIONAL ONES .

All Rights Reserved. 20 | JOURNAL of MEDICAL REGULATION VOL 100, NO 2, 2014Crady DeGolian, Director of the National Center for Interstate Compacts with the Council of State Governments, was one of the featured speakers at this meeting and provided the audience with an overview of interstate compacts. It was the first time that a detailed examination of interstate compacts explicitly entered the conversation, and although the participants did not leave the meeting having coalesced around any single methodology, the notion of an interstate compact for physician interstate practice emerged from the meeting with substantial support. Not long afterward, the State of Wyoming Board of Medicine submitted to the FSMB, for consideration by the House of Delegates at the 2013 Annual Business Meeting, Resolution 13-5, which read in part: Therefore, be it hereby resolved, that the FSMB convene representatives from state medical boards and special experts as needed to aggressively explore the development of an Interstate Compact to facilitate license portability hereinafter known as the Medical License Portability Interstate Compact project, and be it further resolved that the Medical Licensure Portability Interstate Compact project be initi-ated no later than July 2013. 115,116 The passage of Resolution 13-5 by the FSMB House of Delegates at the 2013 Annual Business Meeting is extraordinary in at least two respects. First, despite no shortage of membership discomfort about a loss of state authority, about whether a compact was a suitable scheme for regulating physicians, and about a general lack of familiarity with compacts as a governing tool, the Resolution passed the House unanimously, and with virtually no discussion on the House floor. Second, given that discussions about how to facilitate physician mobility and practice across state lines has divided the regulatory community since the foundation of the FSMB, that the membership should unite in singular fashion behind such a proposal, even merely to study its feasibility, is remarkable.To comply with the Resolution's timelines to begin work by July 2013, the FSMB convened two develop-mental meetings in June and September 2013. During the two two-day sessions, representatives from a cross-section of medical and osteopathic boards conferred and sometimes actively debated the principles and goals of what a compact might accomplish and what the organization of a compact system might resemble. The groups extensively probed the details of how a compact might be financed, how licenses might be issued, what qualifications might be necessary to participate, and what role an interstate commission would play. The representatives gave great thought to how discipline would be handled, both with respect to licenses issued by the physician's primary state of practice and those issued by other states in the compact, and they weighed how to enhance data sharing amongst the compact states. Finally, the groups carefully considered the need and methods to communicate with state medical boards, stakeholders and partners within the House of Medicine, and the broader public about how this complementary process would balance patient protection with changes in medical practice. The deliberations of the June and September meetings resulted in eight foundational principles upon which a compact would be structured: 117 Par ticipation in an interstate compact for medical licensure will be strictly voluntary for both physicians and state boards of medicine. Generally , participation in an interstate compact creates another pathway for licensure, but does not otherwise change a state's existing Medical Practice Act. The practice of medicine occurs wher e the patient is located at the time of the physician-patient encounter and, therefore, requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state medical board where the patient is located. An interstate compact for medical licensur e will establish a mechanism whereby any physician practicing in the state will be known by, and under the jurisdiction of, the state medical board where the practice of medicine occurs. Regulator y authority will remain with the participating state medical boards, and will not be delegated to any entity that administers the compact. A physician practicing under an interstate compact is bound to comply with the statutes, rules and regulations of each compact state wherein he/she chooses to practice. gENERALL y , PARTICIPATION IN AN INTERSTATE COMP ACT CREATES ANO THER PATHWA y FOR LICENSURE , BUT DOES NOT OTHERWISE CHAN g E A STATE ' S E x ISTIN g M EDICAL P RACTICE ACT.

JOURNAL of MEDICAL REGULATION VOL 100, NO 2, 2014 | 21 PAR TICIPATION IN THE COMPACT SHOULD NO T ADVERSEL y AFFECT ST ATE MEDIC AL BO ARDS EITHER BECAUSE OF REDUCTION IN LICENSIN g REVENUE OR AN INCREASE IN FEES . State boar ds participating in an interstate compact are required to share complaint/investigative information with each other. The license to practice medicine may be r evoked by any or all of the compact states. Following the groundwork and consensus-building in the June and September meetings, which created a clear set of parameters around which to construct a compact, a small drafting team met with FSMB staff in November of 2013 to craft and refine the provisions of a draft document. In drafting the compact, the drafting team identified several essential themes to address: Par ticipation in the compact should not adversely affect state medical boards either because of reduction in licensing revenue or an increase in fees. The compact is designed to act as a clearing-house, ensuring that licensing fees are collected and distributed to the appropriate states. Moreover, those fees would be set, as all fees currently are, by the states, and not by an interstate commission. All licensees would have to pay the fees set in those states in order to obtain and maintain a license via the compact, just as with licenses currently obtained via traditional methods. Par ticipation in the compact should not afford a physician an opportunity, under the guise of multi-state practice, to elude discipline, nor should it impinge on states' ability to take action against their licensees. At the same time, participation in a compact should facilitate more effective disci-plinary action than the present system of states reporting to one another, and it should foster protection of the public across all states. Under the compact, an interstate commission would not have disciplinary authority, but would, as with fees, serve as a clearinghouse for disciplinary information to states. The compact would also provide states the flexibility of whether to pursue action against a licensee or not when another state already has, except in the most serious of cases. State boar ds participating in a compact should be aware of the physicians who are, or are capable of, practicing within their borders. It is recognized as critical to boards' patient safety missions that they must not only have jurisdiction over physicians practicing in their states, but they must have clear knowledge of their physician population in their states. Under the compact, all states, when selected by a physician who is deemed eligible by their principal state, would issue a full license to that physician, creating a clear regulatory linkage. Moreover, states will report to one another, again, using an interstate commission as a hub, any changes in physicians' licensing or disciplinary statuses. The interstate compact contains mechanisms, such as r ulemaking authority, to allow member state boards to clarify important areas of policy. Because the compact itself is essentially a multi-state contract enacted as legislation, by necessity its provisions must remain broad. When substantive changes to a compact are necessary, member states must go through the excruciating process of amending the statutory language in every member state, with the amended provisions not taking effect until every state has enacted the change. Consequently, rulemaking authority is essential for addressing many operational details of the compact. A prime example of this is the issue of requiring federal background checks via fingerprint as part of the licensure process. Likely to be a subject of rulemaking by an interstate Commission, to explicitly require in the compact that such checks be performed by fingerprinting could preempt new future methodologies that might be even more effective. States par ticipating in a compact will have regulatory responsibility for an Interstate Commission, not the other way around. Participation in the compact requires state legislatures' and governors' authorizations, but this does not equate to a ceding of authority to a \"superboard.\" As noted above, state boards will collectively comprise an Interstate Commission and oversee its operation. This governance of the compact by a Commission is needed due to the complexity of medical practice and the ongoing interstate coordination needed to maintain the compact's currency, but it is administrative in nature and does not extend to direct licensure or discipline of any physician. States should not have to pay to par ticipate in the compact. Undue concern has been raised about JournalMedReg_Vol100_2_r3.indd 21 7/17/14 3:55 PMCopyright Federation of State Medical Boards. All Rights Reserved. 22 | JOURNAL of MEDICAL REGULATION VOL 100, NO 2, 2014 1 . Compacts, as noted above, ar e as old as the Constitution itself, and have been used throughout American history. Over 200 interstate compacts currently exist, including 22 that are truly national in membership. While the concept of compacts may be novel within the medical community, they are well-tested and operate with great effectiveness across the spectrum of government. 2. For mer Wyoming Governor Jim Geringer spoke at the January 2013 FSMB meeting about his preference for interstate compacts as a means for states to collectively solve their policy problems. In January 2014, sixteen U.S. senators (including one MD) wrote to the FSMB and expressed their appreciation for the work of the state boards in exploring development of an interstate compact, saying \"[a]s you continue the development process, we would like to express our support for an interstate compact to provide a solution to expedite the process whereby physicians can be licensed in multiple states and practice tele-medicine in a safe and accountable manner.\" 118 Elected officials at both the federal and state levels, including Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, understand the role of interstate compacts and broadly support their use in lieu of federal intervention. And, as noted above, development of an interstate compact by states forestalls the uncertainties that may come with federal mandates. 3. Some have asser ted that we can achieve many of the same goals without such drastic steps, that states can respond to these forces in more organic and less formal ways. I counter-assert that if this were so, states would have already taken the initiative. Today's state regulation of physicians reflects an evolutionary process, for which boards deserve credit; that said, absent an imperative to weigh the merits of an interstate compact, it is fair to ask whether boards would still be doing so. For those seeking a substantive change in how state boards operate, the creation of an interstate compact represents a good faith whether an interstate compact could require states to pay dues or fees as cost of that participation. There is no intention to charge states a fee to join or remain in the compact; those developing it specifically envision that an interstate commission would be financially self-supporting through physi-cian fees, as is the case with most state medical boards currently. That said, there are important reasons that the draft compact contains language specifically authorizing direct state financial support. The compact, and an interstate commission, would exist as instruments of the states that join it. It is their authority they are expressly giving to the compact, and with that goes the ultimate fiduciary responsibility for that governmental entity. Without the member states underwriting its authority, an interstate commission might not be considered a government organization for tax purposes. Moreover, those who would serve on the interstate commission might not enjoy the same qualified immunity that they now enjoy as members of their state boards. It does not mean, however that your colleagues that crafted the proposed interstate compact, visualized in any way that boards or states would have to \"pay to play.\" The full utility of an interstate compact should be used to develop additional tools to assist boar ds in their licensing and regulatory responsibilities. Because of the uniqueness of the authority of compacts, they allow states to innovatively address problems they share. One such area for state medical boards is in the area of out-of-state investigations. The proposed compact contains language intended to empower the sharing of investigative information between states and still maintaining the proper confidentiality. Joint inves-tigations between state boards, the sharing of investigative information, and the enforcement of subpoenas across state lines are all examples of what could be accomplished with an interstate compact for physicians. The Interstate Compact: The Better Alternative for State Medical Boards Despite evidence of the long history of state board regulation of medicine, and the mandate from their state legislatures to do so, state boards cannot rely merely on those facts as a defense of the status quo. As a strategy, they are certainly necessary elements, but are not by themselves sufficient. However, an interstate compact is the optimal policy response for boards, for a variety of reasons:the proposed compact contains langu age intended to empower the sharing o F investigative in F ormation between states and still maintaining the proper con F identiality.

JOURNAL of MEDICAL REGULATION VOL 100, NO 2, 2014 | 23 caution in administering the compact than would the skeptics themselves. 6. Consider the pr emise that, due to the combined effects of federal action and the explosion in the interstate practice of medicine (either in person or by telemedicine), health care is becoming a type of interstate commerce; consequently, it merits asking whether it could eventually subject it to the Commerce Clause. If so, the provision of health care could become subject to either \"field preemption\" where federal regulation is already sufficiently pervasive to crowd out state regulation, or \"conflict preemption,\" where state and federal regulation are incon - sistent or state law essentially impedes the intent of Congr ess.119 7. Some national licensing schemes that have been discussed could enable some or all licensing at the federal level, yet leave the matter of physician discipline to the state boards. 120 Given that the essential task of public protection through enforcement is paid for through licensing and renewal fees, this could become an unfunded mandate, seriously impairing the ability of state boards to take appropriate and timely action when needed. 121 If, as noted above, some partial pre- emption of licensure was coupled with a method of allocating funds back to the states, there is no assurance that the funds will not come with policy strings attached. Finally, investigating and imposing discipline, at the state level, on a national license could prove jurisdictionally challenging, as would the question of coordination of federal licensing with state disciplinary actions. 122,123 8 . A federal system would necessarily r equire a significant new bureaucracy, and it is unclear whether or how such an organization could take advantage of the significant existing expertise and board infrastructure within the states. While the federal government does have some limited experience overseeing physicians in its systems, they are still licensed by and accountable to state boards. The federal government's experience is also limited to closed systems such as the Department of Defense and the Veterans Adminis-tration, where physicians are employees or con-tractors of the government and see only defined populations. According to Gilman, \"there is no federal agency with the authority, experience, and expertise to perform the various licensing func-tions undertaken by the states and it would not be trivial to create one.\" 124effort to be responsive to their needs yet safe-guard the public. 4 . Given that state medical boar ds are contemplating an interstate compact, the opportunity exists via the compact mechanism to make important process improvements that would be challenging for states to enact individually. Allowing for boards to jointly investigate licensees and to share data between boards during the investigative process are two key examples. In addition, an interstate compact would streamline the licensure process for qualifying physicians by eliminating the need to reproduce documents multiple times for different jurisdictions once they have been primary-source verified by another state. Inter-state compacts serve ideally to allow states to focus more broadly in problem resolution without resorting to federalization. 5. Ther e is an important distinction between the harmonization of state standards and the ceding of state authority to a uniform national standard. An interstate compact would foster more consistent standards across the country in how state boards carry out their licensure and discipline activities, but it would not usurp that state authority to an interstate compact, a federal bureaucracy, or any other entity. In fact, because compact terms cannot be altered except by unanimous consent of the member states, compacts offer a remarkable degree of constancy. Only through the rulemaking process of an interstate commission can changes be implemented. Because the interstate commission concept is, as yet, an abstraction, it is an easy target for skeptics. However, once implemented, the commission will be comprised of members of state boards, not strangers. There is no reason to assume that fellow board members and executives from other states, serving on such a commission, would exercise any less care and an interstate compact would streamline the licensure process F or quali F ying physicians by eliminating the need to reproduce documents multiple times F or di FF erent jurisdictions once they have been primary -source veri F ied by another state.

Still, just as the leaders of that day resolved their differences for the greater good, creating the FSMB to serve a vital collaborating role for all the state medical boards, those of us within this profession today must exercise the same intrepidness and sagacity to confront the new and more complicated obstacles of the present and the future, and to push onward. All that said, the hard work will be worth it. The U.S. Constitution and important Supreme Court case law have affirmed the proper role of states in regu-lating medicine, a practice that has progressed over nearly four centuries. The question of physicians practicing across state borders has vexed those charged with regulating it since even before the founding of the Federation of State Medical Boards in 1912, although both the opportunities and mounting pressures of modern medical practice have elevated this question's significance to an existential level for boards. Yet these same boards possess the capacity and the expertise to answer the question, springing from decades, even centu-ries, of responsibility for physician licensure. Finally, the interstate compact, widely used in the collective solution of state problems, has also grown and evolved since the colonial era, and it stands as both a feasible and powerful tool for state medical boards to retain the best aspects of what they do as they continue to adapt to a changing world. One might say, a brave new world. n About the Author Blake T. Maresh, MPA, is the Executive Director of the Washington Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery. Endnotes 1 .

Social critic Neil Postman, in the foreword of his book, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, contrasted the fictitious futures of Aldous Huxley and George Orwell: Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egotism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revis-ited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny \"failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions.\" In 1984, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us. 125 It is clear that neither Huxley and Orwell, nor Post-man in his critique of the two authors, envisaged the future as an enchanted utopia. Certainly care must be taken not to spin too fine of an allegorical thread between the future worlds of these authors and what an Interstate Medical Licensure Compact might portend for the state-based medical regulatory system. Still, we also should have no illusions that bringing an interstate compact to life will be uncomplicated or a consequence-free panacea. Such a sea change will require continued critical thinking to refine the compact's language; extensive communication and change management efforts with the public and our licensees, partners, and stakeholders; and the passage of new laws in Legislatures across the country. It will require the establishment of an interstate commission, including physical offices, staff, bylaws, rules, and complex information and financial systems. Mostly, it will require many, many additional hours of dialogue, consultation and even debate among those of us in the medical regulatory community. Recall that it was the very issue of states honoring \"candi-dates presenting themselves based upon their license having been obtained through examination in another state\" 126 that split the American Confederation from the National Confederation for over a decade at the JournalMedReg_Vol100_2_r3.indd 24 7/17/14 3:55 PMCopyright Federation of State Medical Boards.
