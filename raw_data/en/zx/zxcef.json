A PUBLICATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BRIDGEPORT SPRING 2011 The Health Issue A look into alumna Dr. Jennifer Lynne's unique chiropractic boutique and other extraordinary health programs at UB.2U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 Over the last few years we have seen impressive developments at UB: Public-private partnerships with the University of Connecticut, health care alliances with St. Vincent's Medical Center to start the new Physician's As- sistant program, and international collaborations like the 2 + 2 arrangement with a number of universities in China to bring students into our biology, med-tech, and industrial design programs. As the challenges facing the world are ever more transnational, we are proud of promoting a global perspective and giving our students the opportunity to learn with an awareness of the economic and political context of the world. The debate over the economy is more intense than at any time in recent memory. We are all presented with an interesting dilemma. Higher education costs a lot and is coming under scrutiny at a time when almost every area of government spending is being rethought. As a nation, we have been spending far beyond our means. Only now are our political leaders beginning to recognize that failure to bring our spending in line with our income threatens our future and the future of our next generation of citizens. Knowing that we need to do something is not the same as having the insight or the will to do it right. The debate about reducing spending has often slid into attacks on one group of citizens\u2014teachers in public schools, health care workers, government employees\u2014or on certain areas of activity, including so-called entitlement programs and financial aid for college students. The debate has sometimes degenerated into advocacy groups attacking each other: \"Don't cut my program - mine's important and yours is not.\" Regardless of where we turn, we need leadership to remind us that we all will be required to make some sacrifices in order to protect the well-being of the country as a whole. Unfortunately, such leadership is in short supply. All over the country states are slashing funding to education, including to their public universities. The cuts have seriously affected many state institutions, which have had to cut faculty, cancel programs, and increase tuition to cover the shortfall. At the same time the budget debate in Washington has targeted programs like the Pell grants, which provide financial assistance to needy college students, whether they attend public or private institutions. Congressional leaders wanted to cut the amounts available, and the administration wanted to raise the interest rates on student loans. When the number of students who can afford to attend universities is reduced, our whole nation suffers. One important benefit of higher education is the social mobility it offers. Students who may be the first in their families to attend college have the opportunity to achieve a more prosperous and satisfying life than their parents had. Yet this country, which once led the world in the number of citizens receiving graduate college degrees, now ranks 12th. Debate in Congress and in state legislatures has again centered on the importance and value of higher education. Critics ignore the fact that research done at universities, like that occurring in UB's engineering and other programs, is a main driver of U.S. economic growth and our tremen- dous advances in health. U.S. higher education in all its variety provides the flexibility to respond to markets and innovation. The IncUBator was located on campus to take advantage of UB's resources in engineering, design, and business in supporting new start-ups. All of our institutions will have to find ways to improve efficiencies, but even our current cost structure is more than justified by the lifetime earning potential of the students who pass through our doors. The challenges we face today are becoming increasingly complex. The radiation leaks in Japan lead us to a greater sense of urgency in solving the whole global energy problem. The intense desire for greater political participation on the part of the people of the Middle East and North Africa shows us how much we must learn about them. But the key to responding to all of these challenges, and those that lie ahead, is knowledgeable leadership. The responsibility of universities is preparing our young people to lead their generation. That is the mission we must fulfill. As we rush toward Commencement, I think of the 2011 graduating class, many of whom I have come to know personally. Although they cannot be sure of the challenges ahead, they have growing faith in their own knowledge and abilities, and they are anxious to get started. I am excited when I think about what they will achieve. UB is proud of them, and you will also be proud of them in the years to come. Let us welcome the new leaders who will emerge from the Class of 2011.

End-of-year projects and papers, the build-up to finals, the excitement leading up to Commencement: all of this activity is heightened by an overwhelming desire to do nothing at all except relax in Seaside Park. How to manage? One of the most important things students learn at the University of Bridgeport is how to create a life that is in balance. UB offers marvelous resources in Health Sciences, with services available to students, staff and faculty, and the general public. A session with a student practitioner in the Acupuncture Institute can help with that promise to self to finally stop smoking; the stress headache that's been building since January may find relief in an appointment at the Chiropractic Clinic; and a commitment to eating more healthfully can be strengthened by attending a lunchtime seminar led by the staff of the Human Nutrition Institute. The Health Sciences Division, through careful planning and energetic fundraising, is enjoying an expanded presence, not only University-wide, but as part of the greater Bridgeport community, as well. The balance between work and fun, caution and splurge, and save and spend is an ideal we all work to achieve. The University continues to work diligently to ensure that its budget remains balanced for another year. Your gift to UB can make a big difference to us in achieving this goal! So stay in balance. Don't just acquire; donate. You'll be amazed at how good it will make you feel! Meems Ellenberg Director of Annual and Planned Giving Meems EllenbergT owards a healthy UB!Pipelines Between the Covers Dear Editor,I am extremely grateful to the staff of Knightlines for the insightful review of my novel Everything Happens Today (Booklines, Fall 2010). I deeply appreciate your kind thoughts and comments. I also praise you for doing that wonderful article on Professor Richard \"Dick\" Allen (\"Connecticut's Poet Laureate\"), who could be accused of discovering that I had any writing talent at all, and who encouraged me to send some of it out for publication. I was extremely shy and refused to read my work in class. Strangely, I was first published as a student at UB in Allen's classes. There is no harder working poet on the planet than Dick Allen, and it ain't finished yet! Richard Fewell '79 Chapel Hill, NC It's a Cultural Life Dear Editor, As a recent transplant from the university town of Princeton, New Jersey, to the tranquility of Lordship in Stratford, I wondered if I could nurture a cultural appetite looking west to Bridgeport instead of east to New Haven. Learning that a poet laureate lives right next door (\"A Conversation with Dick Allen,\" Fall 2010) and of his connection to a rich tradition of poetry and writing at UB\u2014not to mention to The Onion!\u2014heartens me indeed. How about more? Eric Lubell Stratford, CT 3U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 made possible, have enabled the various professions represented within the Health Sciences Division to promote more informed and inclusive patient care. At the same time, our chiropractic, naturopathic, acupuncture, and dental hygiene clinics, located within the Health Sciences Center on campus, provide for services to upwards of 20,000 patients annually and in 2010 were valued at over $1.5 million to the public. As you read the individual stories and features from our health sciences programs you will see the UB Division of Health Sciences mission in action. We hope you are as proud of what we have become as we are. Sincerely, Dr. David M. Brady Vice Provost, Health Sciences Division Prescriptions for Excellence The University of Bridgeport has methodically been transforming itself into a center of excellence in integrative, complementary, and wellness-based health care through its Division of Health Sciences and the UB clinics. Our impact has been strengthened by recently forged alliances with institutions statewide. Collaboration with St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, for example, has led to the Physician Assistant Institute and provided for clinical rotations within the hospital system for chiropractic and naturopathic medicine students. UB chiropractic students and faculty practitioners also treat patients at the Veteran's Administration Hospital in West Haven. The University's agreement with the University of Connecticut related to pharmacy education is the first agreement in the state between a public and a private university. These initiatives, and the resulting collaborative and integrative approach to patient care that they have U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 34U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 45U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 It smells of the gourmet coffee and chocolate bonbons that sit enticingly on an antique cabinet.

This is a chiropractic office?Dr. Jennifer Lynne '00 has spent 11 years treating the bones and muscles of her patients. The storefront gift boutique that takes up half of her office is meant to treat their hearts and souls. Since she graduated from UB's School of Chiropractic, Lynne's unique business plan has reinvented the practice and given her the opportunity to renew herself as well.By Mike Patrick When she launched her chiropractic practice, Dr. Jennifer Lynne made some adjustments to the way doctors in her field run their businesses. (Others may want to take notes.) AReinvention (continued on page 6) Butterflies' transformation and freedom symbolize Lynne's journey and success. Exquisite gifts soothe the spirit; Lynne tends to the body. 5Photos by Jennifer Marrelli, She Snaps Photography6U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 \"It's filled with good energy and good intention,\" Lynne said of The Backstroke, the business she started on Bridgeport's State Street, just a few blocks from UB. Lynne came to the University as a graduate student, she said, because of its convenient distance from her Long Island home. She said she'd had difficulty being away from her close-knit family during her undergraduate studies at other colleges. \"I just fit in the very first day,\" she said. \"For everyone who saw me struggle as an undergrad, they said, 'Wow, this is the place.'\" She discovered both UB and the city of Bridgeport to be places where she could expand her horizons. \"Growing up in Long Island, if you're not running with the right crowd, you're not running. I was a free thinker; I was a misfit,\" she said. \"There was never a time I felt out of place in Bridgeport.\" She learned to appreciate Bridgeport's rich history, and embraced its diverse culture. She spent hour after hour writing in her diary at Seaside Park, the beautiful shoreline area that abuts the campus. \"For whatever reason, I felt the city welcomed me with open arms,\" she said. I was able to reinvent myself.\" So when it came time to reinvent the chiropractic business, Bridgeport was a natural place for her to do it. After graduation, she spent many years working for another practice before moving out on her own.Her first office was located in a small office in a historic downtown building called The Arcade, but the landlord of the renovated building envisioned it as a retail center, not a professional office building. So, Lynne added a small retail component to her business plan. She spent more than a year there but could not come to a long-term agreement with the landlord, so she set out again\u2014this time armed with a medical-practice/ retail-business plan she'd honed and perfected. She never considered anywhere outside of the city she'd grown to love. \"Everything that was important to me, about the person I wanted to be and aspired to be was here,\" she said. \"I can't really explain to you how right it felt.\" It made perfect business sense, too, she said. Bridgeport is the largest municipality in the state, with thousands of government workers, as well as home to many large corporations\u2014in short, places filled with employees who have terrific health plans that would cover the services of a chiropractor. \"Why wouldn't I want to open up in a place with great health insurance?\" she asked. \"It made perfect sense for me to park myself in the middle of it.\" Her hunch was right on target. Most of her clients are Bridgeport municipal workers, and the majority of them are police officers.Lynne's practice reflects Bridgeport's skyline and her own devotion to her adopted city. 7U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 \"They come here because it's a safe place to be,\" she said. \"It's warm, it's loving, it's therapeutic, it's healing. It's everything they don't get on the job.\" It's also a place for them to shop for a romantic gift on Valentine's Day or gifts for friends, thanks to her unique retail component. Because her chiropractic services pay the rent and all of the other bills, she has the luxury of only carrying merchandise she enjoys herself. She doesn't have to follow retail trends or worry about stocking the latest new toy or gadget. But she said she does enjoy going to the retail trade and gift shows to find new merchandise\u2014even if she is the only chiropractor there. Lynne credits her time at UB with giving her both chiropractic skills and the strength and resolve to work for herself to get things done. The personal nature of the program, in which students were expected and encouraged to speak to the dean directly when they needed something, gave her the courage to go to the mayor of Bridgeport when she needed something for her business. \"You learn to be a grown up,\" she said. \"That is the real world. If you want something you have to go out and get it.\" Left: Lynne adjusting one of her patients. Many are municipal workers or police officers.

Now that he's gotten everyone's attention, Dr. Peter J. D'Adamo is charting a new future for the field of naturopathy with colleagues from the College of Naturopathic Medicine. In the Genes \"Here, take one.\" Dr. Peter J. D'Adamo is standing before nine College of Naturopathic Medicine graduate students, who for the past 30 minutes have been feverishly tapping notes on laptop computers. They're intent on transcribing his lecture into the safekeeping of hard drives. And no wonder: D'Adamo is arguably the most famous naturopathic physician in the world, thanks to his book Eat Right 4 Your Type. Since its publication in 1996, more than 6 million copies have been sold, introducing concepts like agglutination and panhemaglutinins to the masses\u2014and to more than a few bold-faced names. Among them: fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger, who cites D'Adamo as \"the most amazing healer I know,\" and television's Dr. Mehmet Oz, who calls D'Adamo's work \"one level past where most of us stop.\" But D'Adamo has no interest in celebrity. Instead he's determined to train the next generation of naturopathic physicians and to further advance the field by focusing on patients' distinctive genetic makeup. To do that, he's been teaching specialized clinics at the College of Naturopathic Medicine since the fall of 2009. And he's been working on a joint venture between his company, North American Pharmacal, and the College to develop a Center for Excellence in Generative Medicine to be located on the UB campus. As envisioned, the independent Center not only would broaden UB's naturopathic curriculum it also would be based on D'Adamo's most recent research into genotypes. \"It will,\" D'Adamo says grandly, \"revolutionize clinical medicine.\" In fact, later in the day, D'Adamo is scheduled to meet with naturopathic college dean Dr. GSS Khalsa and George Estrada, vice president for planning and construction, to tour an elegant white building on campus that may one day house the Center. But first D'Adamo must finish distributing to his students playing cards from a small black box. D'Adamo's patients live around the world, but it all began with his father's practice in Brooklyn, NY . By Leslie Geary9U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 They're from a deck created by musician Brian Eno and artist Peter Schmidt called \"Oblique Strategies: 100 Worthwhile Dilemmas.\" Each card is imprinted with a principle, such as: Look closely at the most embarrassing details and amplify or Honor error as hidden intention. A student reads her card: Use fewer notes. Smiling, she puts it down and closes her laptop. It's an irreverent way to underscore D'Adamo's earlier assurance to students that the sum of his teachings (and their fervent typing) eventually will \"become muscle memory.\" The deck also seems hallmark D'Adamo, champion of Doing It Differently. For the remainder of the clinic he serves as wise professor and an academic Pan, skipping gleefully from the topic of genotypes to Martin Luther and the creation of modern German. (Luther, D'Adamo informs the class, constructed the language using experienced-based reasoning, known as heuristics, that can be invaluable in naturopathy.) Then he's off to the larger, philosophical question: Should naturopathy codify its techniques? (Pros: \"It's a way to mine data backwards.\" Cons: \"You don't always want A plus B to equal C because that's not what happens in the real world.\") One size for one D'Adamo's real world, in fact, is riddled with exceptions. People, he insists, are unique\u2014not in the way a child is special to a parent\u2014but in their genetic make-up. And it's why he eschews a one-size-fits-all approach to health. Easy enough to say\u2014but radically unconventional. Talk shows, magazines, self-help books, and the Internet are filled with cookie-cutter tips to improve health, (continued on page 10)\"T elevision's Dr . Mehmet Oz calls D'Adamo's work 'one level past where most of us stop.' \"The 1996 book that fueled D'Adamo's success and brought naturopathy to the masses10U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 fitness, beauty, and sexual prowess. Yet this blizzard of encouragement is rife with contradiction. Power foods like salmon, T-bone steaks, kale, and lentils battle it out for space on dinner plates. Vitamin D supplants Vitamins E and C as the supplement du jour. Long-distance runners trade in Nikes for yoga mats. \"We hear so much, 'My diet is better than your diet. I say protein, you say vegan. I say low carb and you say low fat,'\" D'Adamo says. \"All of these [trends] have half of the auditorium thinking you're right and the other half thinking you're wrong.\" D'Adamo's premise\u2014the basis for Eat Right 4 Your Type\u2014neither embraces nor rejects any single plan because each may or may not be effective, depending on what's pumping through your veins. More specifically, D'Adamo believes we should eat, exercise, and deal with stress according to our blood types. Thus he advises blood Type Os to add more lean meats, poultry, and fish to their diets because they better metabolize proteins and ketones, which keep glucose levels consistent. On the other hand, he cautions, Type As store meat as fat, so they should adopt more plant-based vegetarian diets. Call it a hunch That advice, funnily enough, began as no more than a hunch developed by D'Adamo's father. Dr. James D'Adamo was a freshly minted naturopathic physician working in Europe in 1957 when he noticed that some of his clients thrived on vegetarian, low-fat diets, while others actually fared worse. Intrigued, he eventually concluded that \"one man's food is another man's poison.\" While his rationale was based solely on observation and instinct, the elder D'Adamo relocated his family to New York, where many of the city's artistic and cultural elite became his patients. When he closed his Brooklyn clinic for the day, the family, all of whom have T ype A blood, gathered around the dinner table, enjoying Student Maura Henninger is training to join what D'Adamo envisions as naturopathy's future. \" He concluded that one man's food is another man's poison. \" 11U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 Christl D'Adamo's home-cooked Mediterranean and Asian-style meals that eschewed heavy proteins and excessive dairy. Maybe it was his mother's cooking, or a simple case of \"being in the genes,\" but Peter D'Adamo always knew he'd follow in his dad's footsteps. And when he enrolled at John Bastyr College in Seattle to earn his doctorate in naturopathy, he began digging through research to see if the old man's theories about blood type and diet would hold up to the science. His first breakthrough came when he made a link between peptic ulcers and Type Os, the very same group that thrive on high-protein diets. He concluded that Type Os' higher levels of stomach acid, which aid in the digestion of meat and poultry, could cause ulcers if they become too elevated. Naturopathy 2.0Encouraged, D'Adamo kept digging, finding similar correlations; his 30-plus-year career in human blood types was launched. \"The change in the profession has been tremendous,\" he says. \"T o doctors of my father's generation, the wisdom and knowledge was mostly first-person observational. I refer to this as Naturopathic Medicine 1.0. Of course, you have to remember back then, how few people were working with diets of naturopathic nature? Patients were told to eat a balanced diet and that was it. Today, it's currently focused on fitting naturopathic principles to hard science: Naturopathic Medicine 2.0, if you will.\" While millions of readers have taken his message to heart, D'Adamo concedes he still has critics who \"don't understand the science.\" He's not shy about blaming medical schools, which \"don't teach many people in the medical sciences about the importance of blood type other than in transfusions. \"One of the things about teaching at UB is the exposure to the next generation naturopathic doctors and the opportunity to help them understand that even something so simple as blood type has such a complex underpinning,\" he explains. \"To a scientist that's very assuring. When you look under the hood, it's not seeing a gopher on a rubber band. There's a lot of good basic D'Adamo and naturopathic college dean Dr. GSS Khalsa tour the potential location for the new Center for Excellence in Generative Medicine. Left: D'Adamo has taught at UB since 2009. (continued on page 12)\" He concluded that one man's food is another man's poison. \"12U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 science behind the effects of blood groups on highly individualized nutritional requirements.\" Playing with genes D'Adamo isn't simply reaching \"a broader audience\" of naturopathic physicians at UB, he's intent on bringing them along for the next phase of his work in the field of epigenetics, the study of how genes interact with the environment. Heuristically speaking, it's a logical next step. Blood types are determined by one gene out of roughly 30,000. Epigenic genotypes, on the other hand, are the complex sum of thousands upon thousands of genes acting in relation to environmental influences. So while we can't change the genes we're born with, D'Adamo believes that through diet, supplements, and exercise, the expression of genes can be manipulated much in the same way one adjusts volume on the radio. Of course, DNA testing is expensive, so D'Adamo considers personal data\u2014such as the length of someone's limb or torso, and various ratios between these so-called anthropometric measurements\u2014to identify six broadly drawn genotypes, which he's redubbed GenoT ypes. Those, in turn, enable naturopathic doctors to size up patients and personalize their healing. In fact, personalized healing is the crux of the Center of Excellence in Generative Medicine, says Associate Dean Dr. Elizabeth Pimentel. \"It's a really nice method to dovetail with naturopathic medicine to refine individual treatments because we can tease out a person's genotype and phenotype, which is how their genes are expressed,\" says Pimentel. She recalls D'Adamo's first visit to UB two years ago, when he accompanied students on grand rounds: \"He had a really great response to the students. He proposed the idea of teaching a class, and then clinic shifts. But we began seeing a bigger picture of incorporating his ideas into the curriculum so students could immerse themselves into this work.\" In addition to expanding its curriculum, the Center also will provide high-quality patient care, conduct research, and do post-graduate training with a new certificate program in individualized care. Details, such as the Center's ultimate location and opening dates, have yet to be finalized. But College of Naturopathic Medicine students like Maura Henninger already credit D'Adamo for shaping their future. Henninger, 32, was working as an editor for Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler in 2007 when she quit her job to launch a career in naturopathic medicine. \"Dr. D'Adamo wasn't affiliated with UB at all when I started. He wasn't a factor in my decision to come to the University.\" Nonetheless Henninger was well aware of D'Adamo's reputation; she had read Eat Right 4 Your Type in high school, after reading its review in the New York Times. Interested in health, and not a little bit precocious, she plowed through the 384-page book and immediately \"coerced my family to create diet plans\" based on their blood types. \"I followed it pretty closely,\" she says. \"I felt great.\" Henninger continues: \"His mind in just unbelievable, and he's one of the kindest people I've met. To say he has had an impact on the way I think about naturopathic medicine and my plans for the future would be a massive understatement.\" The College of Naturopathic Medicine's clinic features a lab, X-ray facilities, hydrotherapy, and physiotherapy rooms. For an appointment, call (203) 576- 4349. The College runs a dispensary on campus at 60 Lafayette Street that sells vitamins, supplements, herbal medicines, and homeopathics. The College clinic hosts Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes, a support program for individuals trying to lose weight and make healthy lifestyle changes. UB naturopathic students do rounds at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport and at other institutions to care for the elderly, patients with HIV/AIDS, and individuals in addiction- recovery programs. Books by naturopathic college faculty include Dr . Jody Noe's Textbook of Naturopathic Oncology , which is used at naturopathic medical colleges throughout North America, and Fundamentals of Naturopathic Pediatrics by Dr . Jared Skowron, an expert in children's health and autism. \u2014 L.G.At a GlanceCOLLEGE OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE 1213U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 Henninger also works with patients at D'Adamo's private clinic, a fashionably refurbished gray-shingled barn in Wilton, Connecticut. The property boasts a distribution center and shop in the back, where shelves are lined with nutritional supplements developed by D'Adamo. Patients can buy them in person or order them online, and each day a UPS truck picks up deliveries destined for cities across the United States, Europe, South America, Africa, and New Zealand. Henninger doesn't say if she'll develop her own line of supplements, too. But she does want to use genotype-based diets when she opens her own clinic in New York\u2014not far, perhaps, from the Brooklyn practice where the elder Dr. James D'Adamo's hunch started it all more than five decades ago. D'Adamo's Wilton, Connecticut practice, boasts a dispensary filled with his nutritional supplements. Each day a UPS picks up orders destined around the world. \" Talk shows, magazines, self- help books, and the Internet are filled with cookie-cutter tips to improve health, beauty, and sexual prowess. Yet this blizzard is rife with contradiction, D'Adamo points out. \"14U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 14Heal,Pray ,LaughSister Murphy (left) Danika Sicard. 15U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 Nuns are not, Dr. Jennifer Brett acknowledges with a laugh, stereotypical acupuncture patients. But then again, acupuncture has gone mainstream, just like cappuccinos, music downloads, and recycling\u2014those other darlings first championed by hippies and yuppies. \"It's changed a lot from the '70s and '80s,\" says Brett. \"Hospitals have staff acupuncturists, and there's more integration with other medical professionals, too.\" Brett should know. She's currently the director of UB's Acupuncture Institute, and in her 23 years of practicing acupuncture, she has witnessed a widespread embrace of Chinese healing methods that date back more than 3,000 years. Thus it makes perfect sense to Brett that students and professors from the Acupuncture Institute provide ongoing treatment for retired nuns at School Sisters of Notre Dame in Wilton, Connecticut, part of an international order of Catholic nuns founded in 1833. The Acupuncture Institute also runs a clinic on campus that is open to the public, and its students and staff provide acupuncture treatment to patients at Sound Shore Medical Center in Rochester, New York. In total, the Institute treats 3,500 patients annually.Heal,Pray ,LaughSister Beatrice Pavlica shares a laugh with Sadeghi and Doan. Ancient Chinese medicine and Christianity provide for plenty of healing and good company when students from the Acupuncture Institute make their rounds at School Sisters of Notre Dame. (continued on page 16)By Leslie Geary16U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 practice with the nuns, before they graduate and a new group of student clinicians takes their place for the 2011-2012 year.) The four women exchange chatty greetings, then Pavlica fills in highlights from her week. She loves to play the piano\u2014Beethoven, mostly\u2014and paint landscapes inspired by the American Impressionists, who, to her mind, better captured nature's beauty on canvas than the French. But these hobbies make her arthritic hands ache. Pavlica also has osteoporosis, and her back, frozen into a painful arc, could use acupuncture, too. Sicard and Doan direct Pavlica into one of three treatment rooms, where they will check her pulse and tongue as part of the traditional Chinese medical diagnosis before starting acupuncture. During the 20-minute session, during which patients rest while hair-thin needles are inserted at areas of the body with high connective tissue density. That, in turn, triggers a release of natural endorphins from the brain that help the body to relax and increase blood flood. Because of her back, Pavlica also will receive T ui Na, a form of bodywork massage taught at the Acupuncture Institute and offered at the school's campus clinic. The massage complements the acupuncture by further increasing circulation to move the body's natural energy, known as Qi. And so it goes. Fitzpatrick and the students treat six sisters during their three-hour visit. They confer about patient diagnoses before the student clinicians provide acupuncture. \"The main thing we're treating are aches and pains associated with arthritis and aging,\" Fitzpatrick says. \"These nuns have developed a strong work ethic in their life; they like to be active, and it shows in their vitality. Compared to other 80-year-olds, they're in good physical shape and very good cognitive shape.\" At 90, Sister Teresia Spodnik, for example, is the oldest patient the UB group will see on this particular visit. Yet she still works at the Lourdes Health Care Center, the on-site assisted living facility for the sisters, as a medical records and health information specialist. Recounting memories of her childhood, she also makes for a fascinating storyteller. \"I grew up during the Depression,\" she says, when asked about her background. \"My father was an accountant in a piano factory in Bridgeport. The day he lost his job was the same day that the American Bank and T rust The arrangement with the School Sisters, however, was first proposed by a Catholic priest whom Brett once treated for arthritis, neuropathy, and autoimmune inflammation. \"He thought we could help the sisters, too,\" Brett says. \"They're a pretty progressive bunch; acupuncture fit that bill of them being open to new things.\" Since 2006, two to three student clinicians from the Institute have made weekly visits to School Sisters. They're supervised by Jim Fitzpatrick, who oversees patient care as director of the Acupuncture Institute Clinic located on campus in the towering Health Sciences Building on Lafayette Street. \"This is Sister Beatrice Pavlica,\" Fitzpatrick says by way of introduction. \"As you can see, before she retired, Sister Beatrice used to model.\" The gray-haired octogenarian doesn't miss a beat: \"Oh! You're trouble!\" Rejoinder summarily launched, she shifts her to students Kim Doan, Danika Sicard, and Golnar Sadeghi, who with Fitzpatrick are currently responsible for acupuncture care at the order.

When I walked by the bank, I could see the women pounding on the door and crying and screaming. It was awful.\" Spodnik's first acupuncture session with UB student clinicians was in 2007. At the time, she says, \"I was taking various medications and I was worried about side effects.\" She's been able to eliminate her medications, but still takes daily vitamins. \"I'm into homeopathic stuff,\" she says breezily. Others report similar improvements. Sister Christina Murphy began seeing Fitzpatrick and his students in 2008, after specialists were unable to ameliorate the pain she suffered from fibromyalgia. \"I was pretty skeptical in the beginning because so many other things didn't work,\" Murphy admits. \"The acupuncture didn't work overnight, but after about six weeks I started feeling better.\" Murphy credits both the acupuncture needles\u2014 as well as the care givers themselves\u2014for her improved health. \"Jim and the students are very patient. They take their time, they care, and that goes into the healing process. It makes a big impression on you.\" With her throaty laugh, tomboyish short hair, and unvarnished honesty, Murphy leaves an impression, too. She loves to discuss Big Issues\u2014like faith and the state of the world\u2014with the acupuncture students, and this year she's befriended Golnar Sadeghi, who was born in Iran. \"I told her I could understand the Muslim women wearing what they do because for years we wore a habit,\" says Murphy, who today dons a forest green William & Mary sweatshirt, a gift from a niece. Sadeghi, meanwhile, has covered her head in a chic Herm\u00e8s scarf that calls to mind Grace Kelly. Visually, they make for an unlikely pair, but beyond surface impressions runs deep mutual regard. Sadeghi, in fact, tries to arrive early in the day, so she can attend the nuns' church services. \"It truly, truly, truly moves my spirits,\" she says. \"As a Muslim, I'm praying to God five times a day; they're praying always. They have knee problems and arthritis and other problems, but they never nag. There's so much of that in the world, but not here. They're thankful. When it rains, they thank God. When it's sunny, they thank God. When there's a tsunami, they thank God it wasn't bigger. That has been the biggest thing I have learned from them in the past year, to modify my behavior.

We want you to make us proud.\" - Dr. Daniel Cervonka addressing the first class admitted to the Physician Assistant Institute, January 7, 2011 \"They're the first class, and I've said to them, 'A lot of things you do will impact future classes,'\" says Dr. Daniel Cervonka, program director for the Physician Assistant Institute (PAI). Cervonka is in his second-floor office at Eleanor Dana Hall, taking stock. It's early February, and just over a month has passed since the University opened the Institute to train a special class of medical pros, often referred to as PAs, who are licensed to take care of patients at medical practices, hospital surgery rooms, and alternative primary care settings. Orientation Day had been a giddy day, with Cer- vonka personally leading the Institute's inaugural class on a tour of gleaming classrooms, showing off the low-slung club chairs in the student lounge (\"There are five computers, too, in case you forget your laptops, and a printer!\"), and encouraging everyone to mingle during a buffet luncheon. \"Talk to each other. Get to know each other's strengths!\" Cervonka urged, as students helped themselves to turkey sandwiches, fruit salad, and freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. Networking comes naturally to Cervonka. When the University began exploring the idea of opening the school two years ago, he immediately reached out to longtime colleagues. Among them: Mark T aafel, who was hired as PAI's director of clinical educa - tion. Taafel and Cervonka met 21 years ago at Hall-Brooke Hospital in Westport, Connecticut. \"Mark used to tease me that I wasn't smart enough to go to Emory [his alma mater],\" says Cervonka, before biting into a turkey sandwich. So Cervonka went to Yale Medical School, where his anatomy class was taught by Dr. William Stewart. Teacher and student stayed in touch, and in the perfect closing of the circle, PAI students go to Yale to take their anatomy classes with Stewart until the Institute's new anatomy lab opens in 2012. Stewart told to the lab. He also advised: \"Bring a change of clothes. You don't want to wear the same outfit when you go clubbing.\" (Stewart advised Cervonka's students during his own welcome speech at Yale's lab.) \"It's like family,\" says Cervonka. Thus it comes as no surprise that he took an active role in selecting the first class. The 20 students at the new Physician Assistant Institute are training to work in a health care field that desperately needs their skills. They're also creating a legacy for the school that picked them as its inaugural class. The F irst Class By Leslie Geary19U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 One-hundred and thirty-five initially applied to the Institute, a figure that surprised Michael Grandison, UB's director of admissions for health sciences. \"We didn't do a lot of marketing,\" says Grandison. \"It was mostly just word of mouth. But the response was incredible, and the academic quality of the applicants was just amazing. The decision of which candidates to select was a difficult one.\" Finalists who made the cut brought to the Institute breathtaking talent and diverse experience. Among their ranks: an army medic who became a college anatomy professor, a psychiatric counselor, a phlebotomist, and several medical and scientific researchers. \"There are all walks of life,\" says Grandison. \"There are individuals who have made huge sacrifices to come back and get their post-graduate education at the Institute.\" Filling the gap \"There is a need for more primary care clinical providers, such as physician assistants, in the frontlines of medicine.\" - Dr. Richard Torres, chief medical officer, Optimus Health Care, February 15, 2011 Physician Assistants have been around since the mid-1960s, during the Vietnam war. Despite their experience patching up soldiers, only one in three medics returning home continued working in health care, and usually only as orderlies. Popular culture and television shows like M*A*S*H underscored the point: Doctors (some cooler and smarter than others) patched you up, nurses stood by to assist, there was little room for anyone else. Duke University Medical Center's Dr. Eugene Stead sought to change that. He believed that the medics' experience was being wasted, so he developed an intensive two-year program, and in 1965 trained four army veterans as the nation's first PAs. Stead's new medical providers worked under the supervision of a doctor, as they do today. But their duties have grown, along with their role in U.S. health care. Today, PAs write prescriptions, conduct medical exams, order lab studies, and develop patient treatment plans. Many have expertise in specialized medicine, such as oncology; others work in general practices and hospitals\u2014just like\u2014doctors. Yet while the ranks of primary care physicians are shrinking (current estimates peg the shortage at 40,000 by decade's end) the number of PAs is growing, due to demand. The prognosis: an extremely bright job market for those entering the profession. A U.S. News and World Report study last year ranked PA jobs as among today's best careers. New PAs entering the workforce (continued on page 20)The F irst Class Freshly starched: The first class at the Physician Assistant Institute in their new white coats on March 1120U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 with her pep talk. T wenty faces had met her gaze with shy, expectant smiles, but in the past seven weeks she's come to know the personalities behind those smiles. Peterson became a PA after helping to deliver babies for migrant workers in southwestern Colorado. She's also developed curricula for physician assistant programs at other universities. The students she's met at UB, she says, are different. \"This class doesn't want to regurgitate knowledge. They're really taking it and making it their own,\" she says. \"They make comments. They ask questions. That makes teaching different. It makes it easier. It makes it fun, and it's exciting! But there is so much information to give them.\" The 28-month program at UB begins with human anatomy, physiology, microbiology, biochemistry, and other medical sciences classes\u2014standard fare for physician assistant programs. But since UB's is the only PA program in the U.S. with an emphasis on integrative medicine, students must learn about acupuncture, chiropractic, and naturopathic medicine. \"PAs are the ones spending time with patients. They're the ones doing the counseling,\" says Lisa Gengo, a licensed PA and doctor of naturopathy who teaches the integrative medicine courses. \"We want them to understand what an acupuncturist does, what a naturopath does, what a chiropractor does, so they can offer patients a choice.\"may typically expect up to ten job offers, and the average PA salary now runs over $86,000, according to American Academy of Physician Assistants. \"The reality is, we don't have enough physicians entering primary care medicine,\" says Dr. Richard T orres, chief medical officer for Optimus Health Care, Connecticut's largest federally qualified health center. Soon after he \"heard rumors\" that UB was going to start training PAs, T orres contacted Cervonka and T aafel to explore partnerships. As a result of their discussions, PAI students will do clinical rotations at Optimus, which last year had 250,000 patient visits, and at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport and other institutions. \"Hopefully,\" says Torres, \"We'll produce a pipeline of graduates who can work at all federally qualified health centers in Connecticut.\" But first, they need to get through grad school. Two years and counting \"We want every one of you in this room to graduate in 2013, and we're here to make sure that happens.\" - Associate Program Director Martha Petersen to her students on the first day of class, January 10, 2011 It had been several weeks since Martha Petersen, the Institute's associate program director, greeted everyone Zachary Lueders, Sara Steinfeld, and Brittany Varga examine X-rays outside of the human anatomy lab during the first week of classes.21U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 The second half of the program is filled with clinic rotations, when students learn to physically diagnose and counsel patients. \"They're basically going to medical school in two years,\" says Petersen, who thus scheduled classes at PAI in the morning. \"I wanted to structure the program so they could have time for study groups.\" Still, Petersen never expected the kind of academic teamwork she's witnessed to date. Wake up, study. Go to class, study. \"The cytoplasm has lots of free-floating elements to build these things . . cell cycles? . . . If you can associate certain enzymes with certain organelles that will certainly help,'cause you know, it's going to be a bonus question.\" - Three days before midterms, March 3, 2011 Their White Coat Ceremony was a week away, but first they had to get through midterms. So here they were, in a darkened classroom, watching The Inner Life of a Cell. As the film rolled along, they shouted out facts, quizzing each other for next week's exams. Student Erin Carey kept the tutorial rolling at a steady clip, moving from metabolic processes to proteins to membrane physiology. (\"I like the tutorials to be fun and high energy!\" she explained.) Next to her, Zachary Lueders spun on a swivel chair with barely contained energy, engaging classmates like a carnival barker: \"Now let's move onto the golgi. What's the big point about it?\" he called out. \"Yeees! It repackages vesicles. It's like the post office; it gets the shipping orders, repackages the contents, and sends them out.\" Carey and Lueders hadn't planned to become unofficial tutorial guides, it just worked out that way. When librarians offered to train students to use the interactive Smart Boards at Wahlstrom Library, Carey signed up immediately. Smart Board certification in hand, Carey began downloading lessons and supplementary materials, like the cell movie they were watching now, to review the day's material. Lueders joined her, then other classmates. Now, a quarter of the class shows up for the tutorials. \"You wake up, study. Go to class, study,\" says Lueders. \"We are a class of over-achievers,\" agrees Sara Steinfeld, who studies on Metro-North, while commuting to and from Manhattan. A South Dakota native, Steinfeld moved to New York to work as an Alzheimer's researcher at Columbia University. For a while, she considered getting a PhD in science, but she missed interacting with patients (she was pre-med at the University of Minnesota). \"I found out that a PA degree would be the best fit for me,\" she says. With just 20 students in the class, Steinfeld says there's 21PAI students Shondell Diaz and Tadecher Ellis Sara Steinfeld and Dr. William Stewart, who is teaching human anatomy, on the students' first visit to Stewart's lab (continued on page 22)22U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 \"no room to hide, no way to struggle without someone finding out and offering to help.\" But academics alone don't connect the class; sometimes they meet for dinner or drinks. Other times it's off to Wheeler Rec, for pick-up basketball. Steinfeld hadn't expected that. \"You hear horror stories about grad school, when they say, 'Look to left and the right, one out of three won't be here.' But when Petersen stood up and said, 'We hope every one of you will graduate, that set the tone from Day 1. I'm really grateful to be part of program like this.\" Classmates also embrace a proud sense of unity. Houa Van, who previously studied anatomy at UB's School of Chiropractic, is the go-to expert on the subject. Mike Moi, a former podiatric assistant from New York City, is the self-appointed class historian. Nikon in hand, Moi captures it all: study sessions, their first day at Yale, group dinners, and basketball games. Students review lessons by filling in a white board every afternoon and organizing their own tutorials. \"There's no way to struggle without someone . . . offering to help,\" says one.23U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 Even Zachary Lueders's sends care packages to the class from Colorado that are mom filled with chocolate and cookies. That's not to say it's easy, says Tyson Sitthivong. Sitthivong was elected the class vice president but refers to of himself as the class listener. \"It's important to ask, 'How's everything going?' Especially after exams; it can get overwhelming,\" he says. \"I try to see what's going on.\" White coats \"The first class is always memorable and special. In fact, students are so special that we sometimes even name policies after some of them.\" - Dr. David Brady, vice provost, Health Sciences Division, at the Physician Assistant Institute White Coat Ceremony, March 11, 2011 Finally, midterms were over. Everyone had passed, and for today at least, they could set aside books to celebrate their White Coat Ceremony. Many of their relatives joined them at the Littlefield Recital Hall, digital cameras in tow. A rite of passage, the ceremony signified the students' formal induction into the field of medicine. \"The first class is always memorable and special,\" said Dr. David Brady, vice provost of the health sciences, addressing the now assembled group. \"Faculty and administrators in a new program always remember everyone. In fact, students in first classes are so special that we sometimes even name policies after some of them.\" The hall filled with laughter, then applause, as students were called, one by one, to the stage. They shook hands with Peterson, then stopped before Cervonka, who helped them into their coasts, which they buttoned with crisp efficiency. Moments before they had been reminded: \"The White Coat is the most recognized symbol of medicine, signifying expertise and compassion.\" And sure enough, as they stood on stage in their new whites, they did look different\u2014caring, knowing, authoritative. Each student held a program; on the back was the Student Oath. The class had written it at the behest of Cervonka, and it ended with the words: Adiuvare Medeiri Communiter\u2014To Help, To Heal, Together\u2014which was appropriate since they would pledge their carefully chosen words as a group. In future years, other classes would recite the same words. The time had come. Sara Steinfeld walked briskly to the podium to lead them. Looking at her 19 peers, Steinfeld's face broke into a massive smile. \"I greatly look forward to graduation day,\" she said. \"We will all get there together.\" The Physician Assistant Institute is the only program of its kind with an added focus on integrative health; students must take courses about chiropractic care, human nutrition, and acupuncture. Students at PAI get hands-on training and work with patients by doing clinical rounds at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport and other medical institutions in Connecticut. Institute students will graduate to rosy job prospects: They're in demand nationwide, and starting salaries for physician assistants now average $74,000, studies show.

Largely due to dentist Dr. Alfred Fones's pioneering efforts, brushing teeth, flossing, and regularly scheduled dental cleanings became an American habit. The Fones School of Dental Hygiene at UB is aptly named after Dr. Fones, who coined the term \"dental hygiene\" and founded both the school and the profession. Fast forward to present-day Oman: its health care system is ranked eighth by the World Health Organization, but many regions in this country have citizens who are unaware of their oral-hygiene needs or how brilliant smiles relate to overall health. That's going to change if Naeema Al Bulushi has anything to do with it. Al Bulushi\u2014who completes her master's from the Fones School in May\u2014plans to educate Omanis about dental hygiene so they can better protect their smile, and their health\u2014just like Alfred Fones did nearly 100 years ago. Her biggest obstacle isn't access to care (dental clinics abound, and \"treatment is free,\" she says), but widespread lack of public awareness.And that's hurting her country's adult citizens, according to Al Bulushi's recently completed thesis, which examines the extent of tooth decay in Omani adults. Among its most startling findings: of the 380 adults she screened for periodontal diseases, 94 percent needed dental care. \"After age 19, many Omanis do not seek preventative dental hygiene care because most of oral-health programs focus on school children,\" she explains. \"Many citizens only go to the dentist when they are in pain. My dream is to start a dental hygiene program and work as a team to educate the public.\" Many blessings Naeema means \"blessings\" in Arabic, and Al Bulushi has many to count. They are, she concedes, largely the result of focused determination, old-fashioned hard work, and family. Al Bulushi was born in Bahrain to Mohammed bin Saleh and Fareeda Al Bulushi, the third of seven children. Her father, a banker, was the first in his family to receive a formal education. During a time when women typically Naeema Al Bulushi graduates from the Fones School of Dental Hygiene this May with the job of a lifetime: launching a national program with the Omani Ministry of Health to bring much-needed dental care to its citizens.

Her father encouraged Al Bulushi to see further than what his culture allowed and seek out a formal education. Her career choice, however, was the result of a more unusual blessing: When she was 10 years old, Al Bulushi's gums suddenly began to bleed. Subsequent treatments both cured her, and gave her inspiration: dental hygiene. A perfect matchIt's ironic that this bright, intently focused student would get her training half-way around the world, in the very school that started the dental hygiene movement. But it's no accident. It was 2005 when Al Bulushi was browsing online for a school where she could earn a bachelor's in dental hygiene, when she stumbled upon the Fones Website. As she read about Alfred Fones, the school's history, and its deep commitment to public health, she became intrigued. It wasn't long that she was interviewing via phone with Dr. Meg Zayan, the school's dean and an associate professor. Al Bulushi explained her plan to educate Omanis about dental hygiene. At that moment, Zayan knew Fones and Al Bulushi was was.\" Al Bulushi and Dr. Meg Zayan discussing a student's file as Cristina Ayala attends to a patient.27U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 Fast forward five years to a blustery January morning. Zayan and Al Bulushi have met to be interviewed in the newly renovated Fones dental clinic. As the two women chat easily, it's apparent that that while this relationship started out professionally, it has blossomed into a precious lifetime friendship based on respect and trust. Indeed, Zayan was one of the first persons Al Bulushi confided in after her father passed away in 2009. Upon receiving her BS in dental hygiene, Al Bulushi returned to Oman. She served as a clinical instructor and acting head of the Dental Assistant Program (DSA) for the Omani Ministry of Health, where she has worked on and off since 1997. The Omani Ministry of Health is sponsoring her graduate education at UB. When she graduates in May, Al Bulushi will be the first in her country to have a master's degree in dental hygiene. She'll also continue to run the DSA department and establish a dental hygiene curriculum. Ahmed Al Abri, dean of the Institute of Health Sciences in Oman and Al Bulushi's supervisor at the DSA explained: \"Naeema has the potential and values to be a good leader. We are looking forward to her to have the dental hygiene curriculum ready and have it established by 2012.\" The Fones dental hygiene program, Al Bulushi says, will be the model for her curriculum at the DSA curriculum. As such, it will incorporate much of the same, intense training she has experienced at Fones, including on-hands clinical lab training that complements rigorous class studies. At Fones, supervised students provide dental cleanings to 13,000 individuals annually, including children, medically compromised patients, adults, geriatrics, and patients with periodontal diseases. Contagious passion Helping train a nation's new generation of dental hygienists is no small feat. Yet Al Bulushi is not deterred. \"Passion, fall in love with your profession,\" she professes. Her enthusiasm is contagious. Paige Vass '10, a registered dental hygienist and Fones alumna, currently works part-time at Moon S. Lee Family Dentistry in Fairfield, Connecticut, while earning her bachelor's degree in dental hygiene at Fones. Vass first witnessed Al Bulushi's passion when Al Bulushi was Vass's radiology instructor in the spring of 2010. \"She was always eager to help in any way she could,\" Vass recalls. \"One day when there was down time, Naeema sat down with my group and helped us review for our National Boards Exam. It is touching that she took the time to interact with all of us. As nervous as we all were, Naeema assured us that we were all well prepared.\" 27Fones School of Dental Hygiene was founded in 1914 by Bridgeport dentist Alfred C. Fones, and it is the first dental hygiene school in the world. Anyone can schedule their next check-up at the Fones Clinic by calling (203) 576-4137. Rates for dental cleanings range from $5 for seniors up to $20 for adults. Fones provides an estimated $500,000 worth of services to nearly 13,000 patients per year at its clinic and other locations. \u2014 S.R.At a GlanceFONES SCHOOL OF DENTAL HYGIENE 27\" When she graduates in May, Al Bulushi will be the first in her country to have a master's degree in dental hygiene.\"28U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 A conversation with Karen Siclare, assistant director of the Human Nutrition Institute, about why we eat the way we do, how to do it better, and clearing up myths about the food on our plates. People know they need to eat their fruits and veggies, but there's still confusion about what constitutes a good diet. How come? I think we are focused more on looks and not really on health. So most of our sound bites on nutrition are based on being a good weight, but that doesn't necessarily mean being healthy. You can eat crackers or yogurt all day long, and that won't make you healthy. Diet plans are a classic example. You may be eating fewer calories with fake butter and fake sugar, but you may get sick from the other stuff you're eating. What's the best dietary change someone can make to improve his or her health? Before you put something in your mouth determine if it looks like it did in nature. That puts you on the road map to eating whole foods as opposed to fake foods or processed foods. Does a French fry look like it did in nature? No. A chicken nugget? No. A chicken leg? Yes. Sugar is the other big killer. The average person eats 56 teaspoons of sugar a day! Back in the 1890s it was two teaspoons.

What does that tell us about the need for more nutrition education for health care providers? I review transcripts from doctors applying to the program and most have no nutrition classes in their medical education. That's by design. Our medical system trains doctors to find and treat disease. Nutrition is largely preventive and adjunctive to Western medical care. But there's been a shift with doctors looking to integrate nutrition in their medical practices. The USDA published its first dietary recom- mendations in 1894. Those guidelines have been altered several times since then. Given that, how much stock should we put in the so-called food pyramid? You can't put people in boxes with nutrition. That's why we focus on the individuality of the patient at the Human Nutrition Institute. Everyone can have similar symptoms with different causes. You really need to figure out what your biochemistry is and work with a professional to determine what your diet should be. When you can understand someone's chemistry and look at that from a functional perspective, you can get to the organic causes of risk for them and give them individual recommendations. \"The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\" If you didn't know better, that passage from the Book of Matthew seems to describe so many of our relationships with certain foods. Any advice? Behavior is driven by the brain, and the brain is driven by nutritional balance. A prime example is breakfast. If you start eating breakfast with protein in it, you'll do better throughout the day because it gives information to the brain that the body has a proper balance of nutrients. The signal to eat won't come back for several hours, and blood-sugar levels stay balanced. By simply making a disciplined effort to eat breakfast, you can change your entire eating pattern for the day. So a lifetime of dietary change starts with a single meal? Yes, evolutionary steps.31U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 What's the biggest barrier to eating healthfully? Time\u2014the time people devote to choosing their food, preparing their food, and consuming their food. Cost comes in second, but even on a tight budget it can be managed to have the majority of the diet be healthy choices. A good example would be eggs. They're not very expensive and pack a huge amount of nutrition. Cabbage is another. It's one of the healthiest vegetables and the least expensive. We're seeing changes in school lunches nationwide. You serve on the School District Wellness Steering Committee in Ridgefield, and provide input about the food available to students. How important is it to change cafeteria menus when kids eat most of their meals outside of school? It's very important because every meal contributes to a child's development. Most children aren't eating healthy meals outside of their school, either. We're teaching them about health in the schools, and we have to support what we're teaching by what we feed them. T eaching them that fried foods aren't good and then serving them chicken nuggets or patties for lunch every day doesn't fly. Are there foods we feed our kids that we think are healthy that are in fact pretty bad for them? Yes! Yogurt is a classic example. Most six-ounce serv- ings contain five teaspoons of sugar. Cheese sticks are touted as healthy snacks, but a cheese stick is mostly satu- rated fat or if it's low-fat; it's been chemically altered, and that's not healthy, either. Bagels, even whole wheat ones, are simple carbohydrates that raise your blood sugar very quickly so you crave more sugar. And they have a lot of calories and carbs, even if they're small and whole grain. Do we really need vitamins if we're eating a healthy diet? Many people do benefit from taking vitamins intel- ligently, but again, you have to learn about your body and what it needs. You can waste a lot of time and money and create an imbalance by taking vitamins in large does that you don't need. Your one wish for American eaters? That we cover half our plates twice a day with green vegetables.

I love helping people,\" said School of Nursing alumna Moonyeen Leonard Klopfenstein '66. \"I chose a career that I've been passionate about my whole life. To be recognized is icing on the cake.\" Klopfenstein was speaking a few weeks before being inducted into the Hall of Fame for Delaware Women on March 22. Delaware Governor Jack Markell nominated her for the honor in recognition of her contributions to infant care. It's not the first time Klopfenstein has captured attention. Last fall she and fellow members of the American Nurses Association were invited to discuss health care reform with President Obama at the White House. \"I've met with a number of senators to make sure we have coverage for children,\" she says. Guarding kids' health has been central to Klopfenstein's 44-year career as a nurse, educator, and advocate. Klopfenstein earned her associate's degree in nursing at UB. Since 1967 she has educated women and their families about perinatal care, and is the past director of maternal child and psychiatric nursing at Christiana Care Health System in Delaware. The mother of three, Klopfenstein vividly recalls when her infant son was hospitalized in critical care. That inspired her to found Loving Arms Support Group for parents grieving the loss of a child. Established in 1978, it is one of the longest-running programs of its kind in the United States. She also started Supporting Kidds for children ages five to 21 who are coping with the loss of a parent, sibling, or grandparent. Klopfenstein credits her husband for being her personal support network. \"I couldn't have done it without him,\" she says of Robert, whom she met at a UB Student League for Human Rights meeting. \"I was secretary, and he was vice president.\" - L.G.Head Nurse Delaware governor honors alumna's work with children.

And that advanced perspective may soon help make it possible for doctors to create more effective treatments for patients with cancer. Bhosale is conducting the research with UB mechanical engineering professor Macwan, and Kshamma Rane; and the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. The team's work was among 120 projects on display during Faculty Research Day. A celebration of ideas, the February event featured research in global banking and business, education, music, biology, engineering, international politics, and other fields. \"This is a showcase of how much research there is at UB,\" said Dr. Tarek Sobh, vice president of graduate studies and research. It's a great way for faculty and students to learn more about research in other departments and Bright Ideas Faculty Research Day showcases advances in technology, politics, and more. Tech management student Nilima Shroff with barcode technology work she's conducted with professor Elif Kongar Faculty and students from all of UB's divisions for Research among the participants who submitted research. Shroff, a technology management graduate student, and technology management professor Elif Kongar developed a system that uses barcode technology to route unused, or damaged pharmaceuticals back to industry clearinghouses for safe handling. The system is sorely needed. According to the Healthcare Distribution Management Association, just 4 percent of products from pharmaceutical warehouses are properly recycled, disposed of, or redistributed. That creates huge hazards to the environment and to patients when massive amounts of unused pharmaceutical drugs are tossed away, illegally resold, or mishandled, says Shroff. \"It is illegal, but it happens a lot,\" says Shroff. Across The Gallery at the Arnold Bernhard Center, where the Research Day was held, education professor Margaret Queenan presented methods teachers can use to help disadvantaged students increase their comprehension of scientific texts. Queenan's research included a letter from a student to her teacher. \"It is helpful to wonder,\" she wrote, \"because sometimes when you wonder, you find the right answer.\" - L.G. 35U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 Volleyball, 5K runs, and plenty of networking Admittedly, the Chiropractic Olympic Games, don't pack the athletic star power, glitzy sponsorships, or crowds that propel other collegiate sporting events onto television screens and magazine covers. Yet that was hardly the point for a group of students and a professor from the College of Chiropractic who in November flew down to Cocoa Beach, Florida, to compete in the annual competition. Founded in 1992, the \"Chiro Games,\" as they are more commonly called, match the wits, athletic prowess, and social stamina of chiropractic students from North America. In between beach barbeques and parties, competition is held the kind of sports that typically attract weekend warriors and the relentlessly fit, for example, mountain biking, 5K runs, co-ed beach volleyball, soccer, and basketball. The camaraderie-laden games draw nearly 1,000 students. Larger colleges have been known to stack teams with former Division-I superstars, and even an occasional veteran from Olympic time trials. But competition is open to any chiropractic student willing to break a sweat in the name of good fun. \"I went to the games when I was a chiropractic student at National University of Health Sciences [in Illinois]. It was a great experience,\" says Dr. Deborah Terry, a professor at the College of Chiropractic who proposed the idea of a UB team. \"It wasn't just the sports or the social piece, but the networking that was important. I thought it would be a great opportunity for our students.\" Nine answered Terry's call: Nathan King, Mia Mortega, Raluca Duma, and Matthew Arthur. Duma, a fifth-semester chiropractic student from Romania, turned out to be UB's secret weapon, finishing with four medals (three gold and a silver). Arthur captured the bronze in the 5K, following on the heels of two veterans from the Olympic time trials. \"The University of Bridgeport did very well,\" says T erry. \"But chiropractic attracts students who are athletically and wellness-minded.\" - L.G.Chiropractic Games UB's first team at the Chiropractic Olympic Games, where fun is the order of the day From left: Allen Cook, T.M.

But selling one isn't a walk in the park either, cautions David Kohn , director of the business school's accounting department and a senior lecturer in the MBA program. \"Those selling a business are forced to be extremely cautious,\" Kohn writes in \"Selling Your Business: Avoid Today's Hazards.\" The article appeared in the Janu-ary/February issue of Journal of Corporate Accounting and Finance.Kohn speaks from experience. An expert in buyouts, corporate finance, public offerings, and real estate, he led the takeover of several failing banks to create Continental Mortgage Bankers DBA Financial Equities, where he served as chairman and CEO. During his tenure he increased the mortgage business from $4 million to $500 million before selling the company. He's also represented Prudential Securities, Fahenstock, and BB&T Bank Capital Markets.\"The process of selling a business doesn't get much attention,\" Kohn says. \"And in this economy, sellers are scared. They're thinking, 'There's no one to buy my company.' Even large companies are scared to sell at a discount, therefore the buyer has the advantage. He can push everyone around in the acquisition. But there are certain techniques to get their price up.\" Don't simply on P&L statements, Kohn says. Rather, sellers should present an all-encompassing view of what the business does, its markets, competitors, technical changes in the industry, strengths of its staff, and future opportunities. \"There's a whole gamut,\" Kohn says. - L.G. Grading the state's schools Connecticut's schools have been held in high regard for generations, but they haven't always deserved their longstanding reputation, says professor emeritus Christopher Collier in his latest book, Con-necticut's Public Schools: A History, 1650-2000 (Clearwater Press). Collier, the former official historian for the Nutmeg State and noted expert in American history, places blame on the Connecticut's penu - rious citizenry. Battles over school finance have raged since the 1700s, he writes, as have debates over curriculum and matters ranging from desegregation to academic equality.\"They demand excellence but they don't want to pay for it. It's a reoccurring theme,\" says Collier, who began researching the book after serving as an expert witness in the landmark case Sheff v. O'Neill. The 1989 case charged that school districts in Hartford and the sur- rounding area were drawn to ensure that poor and minority students would be segregated, thus perpetuating a cycle of poverty. \"T oday, we face the two-Connecticut situation,\" says Collier, who taught in public schools during the 1950s before joining UB's history department. \"I believe suburban schools are pretty good; some are excellent, and inner-city schools are a disaster.\"High standards mark Collier's own work. His previous book, Roger Sherman's Connecticut: Yankee Politics and the American Revolution, was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. A novel for young adults about the Revolutionary War, My Brother Sam is Dead, which Collier coauthored with his brother James Lincoln Collier, won the Newberry Honor Book Award in 1974. - L.G. U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 38Focus on: Michael Mantell '70 Background: Dr. Michael Mantell is the former chief psychologist at Children's Hospital in San Diego and a former assistant clinical professor of psychology at University of California, San Diego. From 1980 to 1990 he served as chief of psychological services for the San Diego Police Department, where he was in charge of providing services to officers after the 1984 McDonald's massacre in San Ysidro. He currently runs a private practice. He earned his bachelor's degree in psychology at UB. Most recent accomplishment: A leading expert on workplace violence, Dr. Mantell has provided commentary for Nightline, Good Morning America, Oprah, Fox News, and other media. His books include Don't Sweat the Small Stuff: P .S. It's All Small Stuff and Ticking Bombs: Defusing Violence in the Workplace. Why psychology? I was a pre-dental major, and realized that while I liked people's heads, it was not in their mouths that I belonged. I had to take Psychology 101; Leon Teft was the professor. I thought he was a pretty cool dude, and I asked him if I could talk to him about psychology. We took a long walk from campus to Seaside Park, down to the Long Island Sound, and by the time we finished, he convinced me that psychology is what I wanted to do. It was a prophetic walk! So your parents weren't in the mind busi- ness? My father was a shoe retailer and head of the Parents Association at UB, and he met with Dr. Esposito. He told him, \"I don't know what my son is doing with this psychology stuff. Can he make a living out of it?\" He wasn't sure about psychology. But Fred as-sured him that I'd figure out a way to make a living. I guess I still am.You've got a highly unusual career, in fact. I had just earned my PhD in counseling at the University of Pennsylvania when my wife Paula and I went to San Diego for a week's vacation. I was supposed to go back and start a job in Philadelphia, but I met people and they told me, \"There's a good job here for a chief psychologist at Children's Hospital and as an assistant clinical professor at UCSD.\" One thing led to another, and I got it. Paula and I shipped out 99 cartons of books and moved out to California. How did you wind up with the San Diego Police Department? It was March 1980, and I wrote a proposal to start a psychological services. They didn't have one and they bought the idea. During that time period, there was a terrible shooting at a McDonalds restaurant in San Ysidro. T wenty- two people were murdered. They told me, \"You're the chief psychologist, do something!\" What did you do? It was an extraordinarily emotional experi-ence. There were officers crying. There were officers throwing up. I immediately walked among them to be a source of simple support. I set up workshops the next morning for the officers and families\u2014even their children \u2014and had many, many individual counseling sessions. It ended up being a model that was picked up by the U.S. Postal Service during the rash of Post Office shootings during the 1980s and 1990s. The Post Office brought me in as a consultant for those. You also became an instant expert on workplace violence when you appeared on Nightline the night of the shootings. What do you remember? Ted Koppel asked me why this kind of thing happens. Why does a gunman go crazy and kill 22 innocent people? I told him the question isn't Why does this happen? but How? The shooting could have been predicted. We later knew James Huberty [the McDonalds shooter] had asked for help from local community mental health centers and didn't get it. Since then, every gunman mass murder, from the shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords to the guy at Fort Hood, and I've been called in on them as an expert, you could have always predicted it. Workplace stress often spills into the home, but you've been happily married for 39 years. Does having a PhD in psychology give you an edge on the home front? I've tried never to be a psychologist at home! This is going to sound corny but my wife makes me a king and I make her a queen. We're a working team. That's the secret. Best stress buster? Working out. I'm the fitness psychologist at my gym five days a week, and on weekends Paula and I work out together. But you know, stress is a mind-set. - Interview by Leslie Geary U B KNIGHTLINES SPRING 2011 39Alumni Lines 1972 Fred Burgerhoff looks forward to his upcoming retirement as an account executive at Deluxe Financial Services.

A win over Bentley on September 19th, in fact, would be the first of 14 straight victories for the volleyball team, including a historic triumph at Dowling College on October 9\u2014UB's first victory over the Golden Lions since 1994.

Side Lines Big SeasonTheBook Lines Vladimir Drobashevsky '59 was 12 years old in 1941 when he bested his father in chess one Saturday night. Hours later he was roused by the sounds of Luftwaffe strafing his Belgrade neighborhood. Such begins his inspiring memoir, Odyssey of a DP (Outskirts Press). With a keen eye for detail, Drobashevsky vividly recounts how World War II thrust his family from middle- class idyll and transformed them into \"displaced persons\" who made their way from Yugoslavia to Austria to refugee camps to the United States. Bound by love and loyalty, the family slowly built a new life in Bridgeport, and their grace, courage, and humor when overcoming obstacles makes for inspiring reading. (\"My English was limited,\" writes Drobashevsky with characteristic modesty. \"I knew a few words, like 'okay' and 'thank you,' which I pronounced as 'tskenk you.' \") When Drobashevsky makes it to UB as an industrial design student, there's no question that he will excel, thanks to his unwavering optimism. \"I have been a person without a country,\" he writes, \"but again and again, luck and blessings from above have pulled me through.\" In An Unknown Queen (Vantage Press), Latrice Bates '03, '04 writes about personal excellence from the vantage points of teacher, parent, spiritual leader. \"I say to you to do you, be you, sing you, clap you, / dance you . . . just be you,\" she \"Shining Star.\" In \"Constant,\" she urges: to everything do. / . . . Shine so miraculously bright.\" And later still, Bates confesses, \"I wake up everyday with the power of writing in my hand. / The same hand my grandmother washed the floors / of white people . . .\" Poetry comes naturally to Bates; she began reciting verses at 11 and collects quotes much in the same way a philatelist collects stamps. In addition to her writing, Bates teaches English at a Massachusetts community college. She earned her BA in Literature and Civilization at the University before completing a Master of Science in Education. His experience in marketing inspired Brian E. Butler '86 to write Find 'em, Get 'em, Keep 'em (T rafford).

Among the numerous real-life examples he cites: a $5 coupon and hand-written thank-you from a food chain wishing him good health that he received two decades ago. The personalized touch inspired his family to spend $35 a week on the products, or $33,000 over 20 years. \"I don't believe in the 'customer is always right,' but you must always have the right customers for your business to thrive,\" writes Butler. - Reviewed by Leslie Geary UB's soccer and volleyball teams' top performances matched high expectations during the fall season.
