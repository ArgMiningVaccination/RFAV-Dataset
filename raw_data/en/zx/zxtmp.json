These side effects are not necessarily indicative of an allergic reaction and should go away in a few days. Common side effects include: Pain at the site of injection Swelling at the site of injection Fever Chills Fatigue Headache If you do have an allergic reaction to the vaccine, it will usually occur within the first few minutes of being injected. Any reaction requiring epinephrine treatment or hospitalization is considered a severe allergic reaction. Early vaccine guidance stated that individuals who experienced a severe reaction to the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine should not pursue a second dose. However, more recent [studies](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2785466?resultClick=1) have demonstrated that patients can safely get a second dose with proper premedication and oversight from an allergist, even if they've had a severe (or mild) allergic reaction to the first dose. If you had a reaction to your first dose (either mild or severe) and are concerned about your second dose, we recommend scheduling a consultation with Dr. Mehta to learn how you can get vaccinated while minimizing allergic reactions. How Common are Allergic Reactions to the COVID-19 Vaccines? [Moderna COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7004e1.htm?s_cid=mm7004e1_w)were detected. This equates to 2.5 cases of anaphylaxis per million doses administered. During the rollout of [Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7002e1.htm?s_cid=mm7002e1_w) from December 14, 2020 to December 23, 2020, 21 cases of anaphylaxis occurred after administration of a reported 1,893,360 first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. This equates to 11 cases of anaphylaxis per million doses. No anaphylaxis-related deaths were reported for either vaccine rollout, and most cases of anaphylaxis occurred within 15 minutes of vaccination. More recent data from a [study of 52,805 healthcare employees](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2785466?resultClick=1) of the Mass General Brigham health care system reported a higher rate of anaphylaxis, stating that anaphylaxis occurred in 247 cases per million individuals vaccinated. This study also looked closer at individuals with history of severe allergic reactions, and found that about 1 in 10 (11.6%) had an allergic reaction to a vaccine dose compared to about 1 in 20 (4.7%) of those without a history of severe allergic reactions. Importantly, the study concluded that allergy symptoms did not impede the completion of the 2-dose vaccine protocol among a cohort of eligible health care employees, supporting the overall safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine even in individuals with allergies. Talking to Your Allergist About COVID-19 Vaccination Have a history of severe anaphylaxis Have had a non-severe but immediate allergic reaction to another vaccine or injectable therapy Are on prescription medications, such as daily oral steroids, that may interfere with the antibody response to the COVID-19 vaccine Suspect that you're allergic to an ingredient in the COVID-19 vaccines Had an allergic reaction to your first dose of the vaccine COVID-19 Vaccine Allergy Skin Testing COVID-19 Vaccine Allergy Blood Testing Blood samples for these lab tests should only be collected once a patient is medically stabilized. Ideally, blood samples should be collected between 30 and 90 minutes after the start of the allergic reaction, when certain markers are still elevated. Blood samples may still be helpful even if collected up to 6 hours after a reaction.
