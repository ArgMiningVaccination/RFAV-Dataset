Jonathan Gomes, 37, of Crystal Lake, was charged with three counts of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child. He was later indicted by a grand jury on charges of two counts of predatory criminal sexual assault and four counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. The McHenry County Sheriff's Office said a concerned parent made a police report with the Huntley Police Department in March 2020. During their investigation, the Huntley Police Department learned that the incidents had occurred at a residence in the 7400 block of Pingree Road in unincorporated Crystal Lake, which is in the McHenry County Sheriff's Office jurisdiction. An investigation was initiated by the McHenry County Sheriff's Office Criminal Investigation Division and detectives learned that Gomes had sexually abused a child in his household, the sheriff's office said.

Court records show the sexual abuse, which involved a family member who was under 13, occurred from 2015 through 2020. A jury trial began in late October and ended in early November in a mistrial. The case remained active and continued for several months until earlier this month when a negotiated plea deal was reached. Court records show Gomes pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse of a child, a Class 2 felony, in exchange for his other charges being dismissed. McHenry County Judge Tiffany Davis approved the plea and sentenced Gomes to two years of probation. Gomes was also ordered to register as a sex offender and pay $3,400 in court fines and fees. "}
