A New Understanding of Science, Clinical Evidence, Medical Expertise and Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Era of Transmodernity A CRISIS OF EXPERTISE: LEGITIMACY AND THE CHALLENGE OF POLICYMAKING CONFERENCE MELBOURNE SCHOOL OF GOVERNMENT, UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE February 15-16, 2018 The Tradition of Chinese Medicine and Science For almost half a millennium traditional Chinese medicine and biomedical science have been abutting each other, yet for the most part failing to generatively translate each other. This marathon conversation, or lack of it, between the two medical traditions has unfolded for the most part in China. It has been embedded in the diverse trajectories of colonialism, imperialism, feudal dynasties, the republic, modernity, Maoism, science and scientism.(Phd thesis, p. 1. ). Fair and effective regulation of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) will depend on fair, just and appropriate evaluation of TCM treatments. In the past, the values and standards of science have been used to 'evaluate' TCM which unfortunately is leading to the fragmentation of TCM practice. Resisting these ways of evaluation, TCM is labelled 'unscientific.' Colonised by these ways of evaluation, TCM is scientised. It is conventional to use scientific criteria in evaluating TCM, this is widely adopted in the PRC among other places. The development of an evaluation system for TCM practice in Australia that can generate clinical evidence on the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicines is a pressing contemporary issue. TCM is a dynamic and growing body of knowledge. It incorporates systematic forms of evaluation which support innovation. Up to this point in time there is no widespread recognition that systematic clinical evaluation is already embedded in TCM practice of bian zheng lun yao which is the practice of 'differentiating clinical patterns to associate appropriate yao wu (medicinal substances /medicines or routine practices designed to move and transform qi i.e.nature's breath). At this juncture, no evaluation system has been devised and developed out of its own practice. This will necessarily involve a sensitive and partial mediation or reconciliation between TCM and science. THE CENTRAL DISCOURSE IN MODERNITY Modernity is a historical epoch characterised by the emergence of capitalism, industrialism, ratio-legal bureaucracies, and state control of military power and surveillance. Its cultural dimensions include discourses of rationality, scientism ('an uncritical faith in science' ) and progress through economic development, objectivity, and in the field of medicine the culture of the randomised controlled trial (RCT). In his book Cosmopolis the Hidden Agenda of Modernity (1990), Stephen Toulmin aptly describes the cosmology of 'High Modernity' as one 'which saw nature and humanity as distinct and separate' . This cosmology in turn gave rise to the Cartesian credo of 'I think, therefore I am' '' which opened the way to the mechanical metaphysics or \"mechanism\" which dichotomise the mind from the body , theory practice or a 'divide' between 'people' s expectations and their daily experiences of real life' [Tiquia, \" Paradigm,\" 2015]. And according to associate research fellow at the Institute of Modern History, Academia Sinica, Taiwan, Sean Hsiang Lin Lei, central to this 'discourse of modernity' is what philosopher of science Ian Hacking referred to as the \"representationist conception of reality\" or the standard representationalist view in science which upholds the universalising role of theory in knowledge production. It puts theorising forward as the main activity of value in knowledge production. That is to say, all knowledge is a mere abstraction of the objective world. Joseph Rouse in emphasising science as a field of practice said that actions has its own kind of understanding which cannot be reduced to theoretical representations,' Furthermore, he added that theoretical representation is \"indifferent to local conditions.\" MODERNITY The Trojan Horse of Modernity, Science, Rationality, Objectivity, RCT & Zhong Xi yi jie he Healing the Great Divide Between Theory and Practice I would like to suggest a way of 'healing' this fractured metaphysics that separates the realm of 'the abstracted theoretical world' (theory) from 'the realm of the real world' (practice ). In its place I propose the performative metaphysical paradigm of theory-as-practice which holds a \" macroscopic-microscopic view of man as the universe contained in the individual\" Taking this road can bring about the integration of humanity with nature; knowledge with action; mind with body; spirit with body; cause with effect, theory with practice and space with time. In addition, in this 'unified field of existence', yin embraces yang, one element embraces the other four elements/ agents/phases and one trigram embraces the other seven trigrams of the Book of Change . In this way the performance and mapping of the cosmic breath in a four dimensional process which encompasses the three spatial dimensions of length, breadth, depth and the fourth dimension of time can be realised [Tiquia, 2015].This view is similar to the concept of the \" 4D \"block universe\" (BU) in which the past, present, and future are all equally real.\" It is also referred to as 'eternalism,' A New Understanding of Science At this, threshold of a new epoch of transmodernity, which is performed as a synthesis of both modernity and postmodernity but without the excesses of either and which is a third space i.e. a non-hegemonic, interactive and shared yin and yang spacetime where different knowledge traditions coexist in their performance, a new understanding of science as a knowledge system is emerging. In place of universalising theories, there is recognition of locatedness and situatedness as the fundamental characteristics of scientific knowledge. Situatedness of scientific knowledge is 'feminist objectivity' and 'limited location' which makes us ' become answerable for what we learn how to see' (Haraway, 1991, p. 188 & 190). This recognition comes from several sources: the Sociology of knowledge (SSK) as developed in Great Britain, French translation theory, the work of symbolic interactionist group in North America (Verran &Turnbull, 1995, p.115-139). A Reconstituted and Reconceptualised TCM Practice in AustraliaGuided by this new understanding of science as local and situated knowledge, which critiques the notion of a mimetic universality, as developed by numerous philosophers of science including Susan Leigh Star, Bruno Latour, Joseph Rouse, Donna Haraway, Helen Verran and David Turnbull, the practice of TCM known as bian zheng lun zhi ('proposing treatment principles in accordance with the differentiation of patterns of clinical phenomena') [op. cit. R. Tiquia, .1996, p. 15].is now reconstituted and reconceptualised for the contemporary Australian context as 'differentiating clinical patterns to associate the appropriate yao wu', or bian zheng lun yao in Chinese [R.Tiquia, \"Constructing a Symmetrical Translating Knowledge Space Between Traditional Chinese Medicine And Western Scientific Medicine in Australia,\" in Complementary Medicine and Culture: The Changing Cultural Territory of Local and Global Healing Practices, edited by Tass Holmes, Ph.D, & Paul Cherniack, New York: Nova Science Publishers, 2017,161-189]. This clinical practice embeds a performative metaphysical value and paradigm of theory-as-practice which holds a \" macroscopic-microscopic view of man as the universe contained in the individual\" [Chang Chung-yuan, , Creativity and Taoism: A Study of Chinese Philosophy, Art, and Poetry (New York: Harper Colophon, 1963), 41.Chang Chung-yuan, 1963, p. 134] wherein the natureworld and the humanworld are viewed as organically linked by one Qi tian ren tong qi ye . It sees nature and the 'natural body' enacting practices that are a usual and normal part of the whole universe as an organism \u00b7. LANGUAGE IS AN ASSEMBLAGELanguage is an assemblage. It is an assembly of heterogeneous components- letters, characters, phonemes, ideograms, tongue, mouth, throat, teeth, pin yin, books, discrete signals, computers, the internet, and so on. Elements in this assemblage come together in space and time to generate communication, culture and knowledge. Language emerges in diverse forms and versions such as vocalisation, pictures, symbols, digital technology-mediated, alphabet-based and hieroglyphic. Language occurs in a wide diversity, in its many forms and realisation.[R.Tiquia, \"Constructing a Symmetrical Translating Knowledge Space Between Traditional Chinese Medicine And Western Scientic Medicine in Australia,\" in Complementary Medicine and Culture: The Changing Cultural Territory of Local and Global Healing Practices, edited by Tass Holmes, Ph.D, & Paul Cherniack, New York: Nova Science Publishers, 2017,161-189]ABC yi er san www. @ Performing the Chinese Word Qi The assembly of the heterogeneous components of the Chinese language in space and time exemplifies its metaphysical paradigm of theory-as-practice. In the Chinese language, then, writing the Chinese script or word is practically doing it, bringing the actants to life in the assemblage stroke by stroke. From the metaphysical paradigm of theory-as-practice, writing the word qi is experientially performing the ontology, cosmogony, cosmology and soteriology of the universe thereby bringing the cosmic actants in the assemblage to life stroke by stroke. From the 'dots' the inscription, like the imaginary yin qi or 'visible matter' and the imaginary yang qi or 'invisible qi' move together horizontally, vertically, crosses, slants downwards and upwards, and the agential figure comes to life. In the words of Wang Jing Hui, a Chinese Taoist calligrapher who appeared in the American television documentary 'The Mystery of Chi' (shown here on television in Australia in l993): 'When I write the Chinese script for 'water' (which is shui) , I become water. As I wrote the Chinese script shui ('water'), it was like swimming in 'water'.And this, according to the late Pierre Ryckmans, is 'the living reality' brought about by the 'conjuring power' of the Chinese 'Written Word'. Step-by-Step Calligraphic Construction of the Chinese Script OF the Chinese word Qi In Ten Strokes . What is Qi or Ch'i Ch'i is the most important component of feng Shui. One feng shui expert wrote: \" if a geomancer can recognize ch'i, that is all there is to feng shui. Ch'i is the vital force that breathes life into animals and vegetation, inflates the earth to form mountains, and carries water through the earth's ducts. Ch'i is a life essence, a motivating force. It animates all things. Ch'i determines the height of mountains, the quality of blooms, the extent of potential fulfillment. Without ch'i, trees will not blossom, rivers will not flow, man will not be. And while all things \u2014 hills, streams, trees, humans, stones\u2014 inhale ch'i, they also exhale it, thus affecting each other. Ch'i is a pervasive concept in Chinese traditional arts ranging from acupuncture and medicine to feng shui and gong fu (commonly known as 'kung fu'). It can include such diverse phenomena as the energy that moves waves; the source of fertile earth; what martial artists channel when striking powerful blows; what acupuncturists seek to activate with their needles and even man's aura qi se . For thousands of years, the Chinese have hired feng shui experts to divine, like architectural dowsers, where the best ch'i flows in the landscape. Mentioned as early as the I Ching, ch'i later blossomed as a neo-Confucian concept in the twelfth-century work of Chu Hsi. To the Chinese, ch'i links spirit and substance. Light ch'i float as air; heavy ch'i sits to form matter. \" Ch'i is extensive and vague. Yet it ascends and descends, and moves in all ways without ever ceasing. That which floats upwards is the yang that is clear, while that which sinks to the bottom in yin that is turbid.Ch'i follows the pattern of Tao, changing condensing, and expanding, inhaling and exhaling. At times it is mass; at other times vapour. PROVENANCE: 1)Rossbach, S.(1983). Feng Shui The Chinese Art E.P. Dutton. New York, USA, pp. 21-25. 2)Rossbach, S.

Counter-intuitively, it was the steam engine that inspired Tang to create a new understanding of qi-transformation in the human body and a new characteristic of Chinese medicine in opposition to Western anatomy,\" [op.cit., Sean Hsiang-Lin Lei,, 2014, 72. Chen Ding San diagrammed and explicated the principle of qi (life force) transformation and referred to it as the fountainhead of Chinese medicine . Tang Zong Hai Chen Ding SanQi- Transformation : A Translating Image The essentials of ChengDing San's written text ( jingwen) have been assembled ( ju) into the illustration chart above. The diagram with the yin and yang, the five elements and the spleen and stomach at the centre is the originating point of the process of qi transformation of the sky, humanity and earth. The next circular diagram represents 'before the sky' and 'after the sky' eight trigrams, 64 which established the universal order. 65 The next diagram represents the twenty-four palaces to differentiate the earthly quadratic directions (time-space). 66 Hence, the subsequent circular diagram represents the 'four directional locales (south, north, east and west); the four seasons and then the twenty-four sub-seasonal phases which gives testimony to the meeting between the sky and the earth. The next circular diagram represents the 'six qi' and 'six divisions' corresponding to specific seasonal order; and the final circular diagram representing the five visceral organs and the six hollow internal organs network systems. These should all be closely linked with the spleen and stomach at the centre and come together with the yin, yang and five elements to make clear the philosophy of one qi that flows through heaven, earth and humanity ( tian di ren yi qi liuxing). If this 'decree' is brought together ( neng hui ci zhi) then the beauty of the spontaneous shaping, generation and formation of natural beings ( zaohua shengchen zhi miao) as well as the 'subtle signs of movement' in the opening and closing of the yin and yang qi ( yin yang he pi zhi ji) may all be reached. Especially with regards Chinese medicine, how is it that this is not expressed explicitly? Westerners, too, know that humans cannot survive even for a short while ( yi xi [one breath]) when denied this substance [in the air ( kongqi)] that nurtures one's original constitution which is the principal and secondary factor that accounts for the changes, transformations as well as harmony and concordance in and among humans. In actuality, this point must be the subject of deep deliberation. This is the reason why this demonstration chart (or 'cosmic clock', 'cosmograph', or 'diviner's board', or the geomantic compass ) is referred to here as the fountainhead yuan 69 of Chinese medicine 70 [and other traditional Chinese natural studies and practices.

He/she is also endowed with the Five Elements which in turn generates the Five endogenous Zang organs . The Six endogenous fu and Five endogenous zang organs generate the twelve acupuncture meridians, the Five Sense Organs wu guan (eyes, ears, lips. nose, tongue), the 'nine body openings' jiu qiao , the four extremities, and the 'hundred bones'.These are all categorized under 'visible matter' you xing zhi zhi . None of these are unconnected with Heaven and Earth. The visible matter or substances in turn generate the 'invisible qi' . On the other hand, the invisible qi moves the visible substances, none unconnected with Heaven and Earth. When the yin and yang qi move in harmony, then all the natural things multiply and thrive. And when the Six qi flow in harmony, then all the acupuncture meridian pathways in the human body are not blocked, while human feelings and emotions manifests naturally qing li ziran . Otherwise, people become sick.\" Furthermore, contemporary qigong practitioner Zhan Ruo Shui in his book Breathing Techniques for Nurturing Life Exercises in the Inner Cannons (1990), refers to the imaginary yang qi as a type of energy which has the propensity to be 'efficacious but invisible' ; while referring to the imaginary yin qi as possessing the propensity to undergo transformation as a materialized body, i.e. 'solidification' ]. The concept of yang qi is therefore quite similar to the metabolic process of 'catabolism' which involves the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones accompanied with the release of energy, while the notion of yin qi is similar to the process of 'anabolism' which involves the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones which is accompanied by the storage of energy.

This sequence is used to to explain the principle of motion of spacetime qi in the Northern Hemisphere universe yuzhou and was the basis for the development of the Chinese calendar. And the dynamic flow of the human cosmic breath qi ( qi hua ) follows this directional spin as the late Chinese medical schola r Yang Ru- Hou observed during the 1920s . Using the Northern Hemisphere Stems & Branches Calendrical Clock to Align the flow of Our Cosmic Breath Qi With The Flow of Season/Time The Northern Hemisphere Calendrical Clock NHCC has an hour and a second hand that move in a clockwise direction. This is the directional flow of the motion and transformation ab initio of spacetime qi qi hua in the Northern Hemisphere.This sequence is used to explain the principle of spacetime qi motion and transformation in the Northern Hemisphere universe yuzhou and was the basis for the development of the Chinese calendar in the Northern Hemispherical region of China. To complete an hourly cycle, the longer second hand of the NHCC has to move round the clock in a clockwise direction in 3600 seconds <<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0QvXc8yLTQ>>. Hence the astronomical divisions of the celestial sphere is expanded from ten equidistant longitudinal segments; then to 64 spacetime longitudinal sections to 3600 longitudinal segments to cover an hour of clockwise motion of the longer hand of the clock. The Directional Flow of Ch'i Transformation in the Southern Hemisphere In the 'Diagram Exploring the Origins of Chinese Medicine (orienting towards the south)' drawn by Chen Ding-San that I turned upside down so that it is oriented towards the north, let us see how the motion of the comic breath qi in the Southern Hemisphere universe yu zhou unfolds. Starting from the east, the order of the houtian (after the sky/Heaven) eight trigrams follows a counter-clockwise sequence of zhen , , li , kun , dui , qian , kan and gen . This sequence is used to explain the principle of motion of the universe(in the Southern Hemisphere) and was the basis for my development of the Chinese calendar in this hemispherical side of the globe. And the dynamic flow of the human qi (qi hua ) in the Southern Hemispherical region of Australia and New Zealand, follows this directional spin. Using the The Southern Hemisphere Stems & Branches Calendrical Clock To Align Our Cosmic Breath Ch'i With the Flow of Season/ Time \" The basic unit for measuring time is the second. The second multiplied evenly by 60 gives us minutes, or by 3600 gives us an hour. The length of days, and even years, is measured by the basic unit of time, the second [Jespersen, J. and Randolph, J.F (1999). From Sundials to Atomic Clocks Understanding Timeand Frequency. Dover Publications, Mineola, USA 23 pp].\" The Southern Hemisphere Calendrical Clock has two hands: a shorter hour hand as well as a longer second hand that both turn in a counter-clockwise direction. This is the directional flow of of the motion and transformation ab initio of spacetime qi in the Southern Hemisphere [Tiquia, \" Paradigm\", 212]. To complete an hourly cycle, the longer second hand of the SHCC has to move round the clock in a counter-clockwise direction in 3600 seconds <<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aey1oJiiP-8>> .Hence the astronomical divisions of the celestial sphere is expanded from ten equidistant longitudinal segments; then to 64 spacetime longitudinal sections to 3600 longitudinal segments to cover an hour of counter-clockwise motion of the longer hand of the clock. Three agential figures, or aspects which work in relation to one another within every episode of A TCM clinical practice.In the clinical practice of TCM there are three agential figures, or aspects which work in relation to one another within every episode of clinical practice. These agential figures are (a) the yao as an exemplary of all those interventionary tools that TCM practitioners have at their disposal, (b) the figure of the 'uneasy' body of the patient, and (c) the disciplined or trained practitioner and the corporate body of TCM practitioners generally. The practice of bian zheng lun yao grows out of the materiality and expressed energy of the patient's body. Signs and symptoms display the condition of the patient's state of health and illness, and practitioners do not represent or typify it. Instead, they re-present, re-enact or perform it. A picture of Yin and Yang imbalance or disharmony may emerge, and from this picture, TCM practitioners work out the required approach to the 'doing' of the healing repertoire or 'tools', or yaowu (or medicinal matter/substance), to be deployed. The Yao TCM is a product of a 'strategy which connects'. Using this strategy, TCM theory is reconnected with its practice of differentiating clinical patterns and association yao. The TCM clinical microworld which is constituted by the three agential figures of the a) the yao , routine therapuetic practices and tools that move the patient's Qi, including acupuncture, traditional Chinese massage, food therapy, prescribing materia medica, emotional counter therapy, Qi exercises, Tai ji quan; b) the gure of the 'uneasy' body of the patient; c) the disciplined practitioner and corporate body of TCM practitioners, is reconnected with the natureworld or the macroworld . Humanity becomes one with nature and One Qi connects us all. This in turn provides the basis for generating a new clinical evaluation template : the 'Four Evaluation Techniques si ping as an extension and development of the epistemology/ontology or imaginary of TCM. This is a template that is separate and independent of and distinct from the randomised controlled trials (RCT) proposed by the received view in the Western scientic biomedical model [R. Tiquia, \" Constructing a Non-Hegemonic, Interactive Space for Traditional Asian Medicine,\" Proceedings of the 17th Biennial Conference of the Asian Studies Association of Australia (ASAA).Melbourne (2008) Proceedings of the 17th Biennial Conference of the Asian Studies Association of Australia (ASAA). Melbourne (2008).<<http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/mai/les/2012/07/reytiquia.pdf>>Accessed Feb. 14, 2018]. The yao as a TCM tool is a heterogeneous assemblage of acupuncture (needles, acu-tract and acu-point charts), herbal medicines, Tuina, food therapy, yang sheng and Qi exercise . Like the Chinese ideograph which moves horizontally, vertically, slopes up, down and crosses in accordance with a standardised ordering to convey the right meaning; it is the nature of the yao to embed a qi that assumes a double 'Yin visible material and an invisible Yang qi' life form, which possesses motion that is variously ascending, descending, sinking, floating, moving in, moving out, hot and cold, and in a state of dispersion or condensation. These varied qi motions of the yao (medicinal substance) or a group of yao, represent a standardised formula (fang) which ts the clinical pattern of imbalance or disequilibrium to the uneasy body of the patient. Generating Clinical Evidence On The Efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicines TCM is a dynamic and growing body of knowledge. It incorporates systematic forms of evaluation which support innovation. Up to this point in time there is no widespread recognition that systematic clinical evaluation is already embedded in TCM practice of bian zheng lun yao which is the practice of 'differentiating clinical patterns to associate appropriate yao wu (medicinal substances /medicines or routine practices designed to move and transform qi i.e.nature's breath).In TCM, this clinical evaluation is undertaken by employing the Four Examination Techniques Si Zhen as a clinical evaluation template or tool. Instead of using the Four Examination Techniques Si Zhen of observing, listening/smelling, palpating and inquiring to gather clinical data for eventual diagnosis of the patient's clinical condition, the Four Examination Techniques Si Zhen undergo a transformation into the 'Four Evaluation Techniques' Si Ping to observe, palpate, listen/smell and interrogate clinical signs and symptoms for data needed to evaluate the efficacy of the therapy administered. The data gathered through the application of the Four Evaluation Techniques are then checked, examined, verified, and compared with data on clinical signs and symptoms collected and recorded on the medical case statement Yi An during the previous visit. Using the Four Evaluation Techniques, the clinical pattern of a contingent patient is revisited or 'retraced' lin zheng to evaluate whether the therapy achieved the aim of bring about balance or harmony in the patient's condition. Hence, every subsequent visit or clinical consultation is a process of evaluation of the therapy administered during the previous visit.

Observation: Patient was carried into the surgery by his father who rang me up last night at 10:00 pm to book his son for consultation. The patient looks tired. He complained of soreness on both sides of his neck. His tongue is reddish in colour while the coat is thick and white. Using an ear thermometer, I found out that Edgar's temperature was 38C. Inquiry: The patient had high fever for the past 4 days. The mother had the symptoms of cold first and subsequently Edgar developed the symptoms. He was taken by the parents to the local Western medical practitioner who prescibed Amoxycillin. The parents took the axilla temperature which came to 38\u00b0 C. Edgar had no appetite to eat and later developed nausea and vomiting. According to the parents, Edgar lost a lot of weight . Listening: Using the stethoscope, I heard no moisty rales coming from the patient's lungs. I heard the patient cough several times during the consultation. Palpation: Both radial pulses were rapid and agitated. Diagnosis: Winter warm factor disorder (epidemic) which is seen as seasonal influenza in Western biomedicine. No antibody test was undertaken by the physician to confirm whether the patient is a carrier of the A H1N1virus (swine flu) .Therapeutic Method: Cool down the heat/fever, stop the cough by promoting the ventilating functions of the lungs and bolstering the patient's spleen Qi.

Upon inquiry (from the parents), the patient's high fever went down on the night of the last treatment. I took his temperature using the ear thermometer and the patient's temperature registered at 36.3\u00b0C (which is normal). But the parents said that he is coughing a fair bit. Using a tongue depressor and a torch I inspected his throat. The throat and both tonsils are red and swollen. But the patient came to the surgery without being carried by his dad and in better spirits. Edgar said that he is also suffering from frontal headache pointing to the area between the inner ends of his eyebrows. The vomiting also stopped on the day of the last treatment. Upon palpating his radial pulses, I found that they are still rapid but not as tense. Using the stethoscope, I also checked if there are any rales coming from his lungs. I did not find any [R.

A Translation/Communication Space Between Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Scientific Biomedicine in AustraliaUsing a cultural and linguistic translation of Warm Factor Epidemic (Wenbing) as seasonal viral influenza, treatment was given to patients who appeared to suffer from swine flu infection. The patient's condition was diagnosed as winter warm factor disorder (dong wen) in accordance with the tradition of Chinese medicine in Australia. This required a counter translation or interrpretation of wenbing as A- H1N1 viral infection in accordance with the tradition of Western biomedicine. In the process, a non-hegemonic and interactive translation/communication space between traditional Chinese medicine and Western biomedical traditions was constructed in a Southern Hemispherical country, Australia.
