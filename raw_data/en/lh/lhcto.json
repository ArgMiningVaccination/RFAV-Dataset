Mo st people with Hepatitis B recovers completely but about 5 -10 % of infected individuals become chronic carriers of the virus. Most of these people have no symptoms, but can continue to transmit th e disease to others. Some may develop chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver , the virus also appears to be causative factor in the development of liver cancer. Immunization against hepatitis B can prevent acute hepatitis and reduce sickness and death from chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer. THE VACCINE: Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV vaccine) is made using recombinant DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) technology. The vaccine contains nothing of human origin! A high percentage of healt hy people who rece ive three doses of this vaccine achieve high levels of surface antibody ( HBsAb) and protection against H epatitis B. Full immunization req uires three does of vaccine given over a six month period. There is no evidence that the vaccine h as ever caused Hepatitis B or AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). Individuals infected with HBV prior to receiving the vaccine may go on to develop clinical hepatitis in spite of immunization. The duration of immunity is unknown at this time but lo ng term protection is probable. POSSIBLE VACCINE SIDE EFFECTS: The incidence of side effect s is very low. No serious side effects have been reported with the vaccine. A few individuals have reported tenderness and redness at the injection site. Low grad e fever may occur. Rash, nausea, joint pain , and mild fatigue have also been reported. The possibility exists that more serious side effects may be identified in the future. The vaccine should not be taken by persons allergic to yeast o r other components of the vaccine, or by pregnant , or nursing women , without consulting their personal healthcare provider.
