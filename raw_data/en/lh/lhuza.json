Discover Your Dosha The foundation of Ayurveda resides in the belief that five master elements (space, air, fire, water and earth) comprise everything within and outside of our bodies and create three primary patterns known as doshas: VATA movement and change in our body and mind (space, air) PITA regulates digestion and metabolism (fire, water) KAPHA protects the integrity and structure of our body and mind (water,earth) Every individual has a unique quantity and quality of each Dosha and underlying elements. Discover your Dosha and ways to maintain balance. Recipes Ayurveda is clear on this: all health \u2014 let's repeat this \u2014 ALL good health starts with digestion; with the proper metabolism of food. Accordingly, one of the most important things we can do for our health every day of the year is to eat wisely. Food is considered just as powerful as medicine. In fact, there is a sloka (writings of the ancient texts of ayurveda) that says \"food is medicine when consumed properly.\" If we eat foods uniquely suited to our physiology, and follow a sattvic (life supporting) routine that enhances digestion, our bodies will reap the benefits and we will find that our days will be happier, healthier and filled with real vitality \u2014 at any age. Mindful Movement Mindfulness can be defined as \"awareness that arises through paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment, non-judgmentally.\" This way of being has been incorporated in various medical, work and mental health settings proving its ability to positively change lives. The main three aspects of practicing mindfulness are awareness, non-judgment and acceptance. Follow our blog to learn how you can incorporate simple wellness practices into your daily life. "}
