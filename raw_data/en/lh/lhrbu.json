With its enchanting leaves and crisp winds, autumn serves as a guide for us to shift our attention inward and restore balance within ourselves to sustain our vitality as we prepare for the rooting, resting, and quietude that the world of winter brings. Preparing for Seasonal Changes The work we put forth to prepare for these changes is just as, if not more significant than the change itself, especially with regards to our health. If we take care to anticipate the colds and ills that often meet us around this time, more of the season can be spent enjoying the season's golden sun and our renewed sense of wellbeing. A tradition passed down from our agrarian ancestors, autumn has long been a time to not only celebrate a bountiful harvest, but also focus on a shared sense of gratitude for all of the gifts we receive. While some of us may have a bit of trouble letting go of the bright, balmy days of summer, there's something to be said of the sanctity in realigning ourselves\u2014mind, body, and spirit\u2014to transition with the seasons and ready ourselves for the days to come. How to Prepare for the Transition to Autumn To help ease your transition into these quieter, more chilling days and help you center yourself in your own rituals for rest and giving thanks, we here at Arogya have crafted a guide to help you maintain your autumnal wellness. Here are a few short ways you can begin preparing yourself right away: Adjust your diet Warming, nourishing foods like thick soups, stews, and broths are integral to maintaining wellness throughout the cooler months. Reintroducing hot cereals for breakfast, [roasted vegetables](https://blog.arogya.net/delectable-delicata-squash/) for lunch and robust, hearty stews for dinner can all be great ways to align yourself with seasonal eating. When eating cool, raw foods, be sure to include herbs & spices like cinnamon, ginger, turmeric, and garlic to encourage internal warmth. Arogya's [Turmeric Ginger](https://blog.arogya.net/a-soothing-winter-tonic-our-turmeric-ginger-tisane/) tea, one of our autumn staples, is perfect for this. While internal warmth is important for strength, too much can transform into dryness. Be sure to supplement your diet with plenty of moistening foods such as seaweed, mushrooms, [apples](https://blog.arogya.net/a-healthier-twist-on-apple-crisp/), pears, nuts, and dairy products to ensure an adequate amount of bodily moisture. Remember, balance is key. Take care of your skin The falling temperatures can often make our skin look and feel dry and undernourished. The [Ageless La Cure skincare line](https://www.arogya.net/shop/skincare) is formulated with plant-based ingredients and synergistic blends of essential oils that revitalize and nourish your skin. Start hydrating in the first step of your skincare routine with a soothing cleanser. The [Ageless Cleansing Foam](https://www.arogya.net/wellness/anti-aging-cleansing-foam) is a gentle cleanser that revitalizes and purifies the skin while also protecting it from moisture loss. When it comes to maintaining moisture levels in your skin, the [Ageless Extreme Hydrating Cream](https://www.arogya.net/wellness/anti-aging-extreme-hydrating-cream) is perfect for protecting your skin against dry or extreme weather. The ingredients easily absorb into the skin to lock in moisture, strengthen your skin's natural barrier, and keep skin vibrant. Slow down and rest As the days darken, we are naturally inclined to crave more time for rest to give us the strength we need to navigate the colder, deeper months of the year. Now is a time to begin slowing down and bringing your awareness to hearth and home. Embrace the transition We need only look around us to find ways to embrace the transitions between seasons. Just as the trees are shedding their leaves, so too should we be letting go of what no longer serves or nourishes us in order to create more space for the things that do. Take a step back, approach work more slowly and intentionally, spend more time communing with loved ones, and most importantly, take care of yourself. Acupuncture and Therapeutic Massage The change in season brings a lot of subtle, and not-so-subtle, changes to our minds, bodies, and lives. [Acupuncture](https://www.arogya.net/acupuncture) and [Massage](https://www.arogya.net/massage-body-work) are excellent ways to help your body align with these changes, boost your immune system, and improve circulation to keep your body warm, which all help to optimize your health and well-being during this time of transition. In Chinese medicine, fall is the time of the Metal element, which rules the lungs and large intestine. The lungs are associated with the feeling of letting go. When we are in harmony with nature, letting go is easy. Just like the trees effortlessly let go of their leaves, we release emotions, ways of being, and thoughts with serenity and gratitude. But for many, letting go, whether it's of feelings, relationships, habits, or summer's warmth, is not so easy. This is where acupuncture and massage can be so helpful. By working to unblock the meridian channels, bring ease to the body and peace of mind, these powerful therapies work on all levels of your being, helping you to let go of whatever you need to let go of, and joyfully surrender to this wonderful time of year.
