By claiming for it Vedic status (asserting therefore its sacred origins) these texts underscore its legitimacy and divine authority. In twentieth-century India, in a context where Ayurveda has come to be increasingly professionalised and secularised (in imitation of the biomedical model), assertions of its sacred origins have been made with renewed vigour alongside claims that it has a scientific basis. These assertions are prominent also in narratives on Ayurveda in transnational networks of holistic health, particularly in Anglo-American contexts. 'Spirituality' and 'holism' in particular have emerged as important tropes in these narratives, often feeding into discursive strategies for asserting Ayurveda's distinctiveness from, and superiority to, modern biomedicine. The multiple meanings in modernity associated with Ayurveda's 'Vedic,' 'scientific,' and 'spiritual' basis are the central foci in this chapter. "}
