From May to October 2020, t here had been significant increases in service provision as a result of the gradual return of staff to Core duties from Covid specific services. At the time of writing (April 22nd) there has been a significant decline in disease in the community and increasing evidence that the vaccination programme is yielding results with infection rates in LTRFs significantly reduced. However, Community Services in the earlier part of March were significantly impacted by the third wave and this is reflected in the figures. Additionally, it must be borne in mind the services are still operating in a Covid environment and this impacts on productivity. In terms of Covid the following is the case at April 22nd. The number of new cases fluctuates by day but overall is tr ending downwards at a slow rate. New cases this week are down 7% on the previous week. The 5 and 7 day moving averages of new cases per day fluctuate by day but overall are trending downwards. Compared to last week, the 5 day average is down 3% and the 7 d ay average is down 7%. Community referrals for the past week (up to Sunday 18th April) were down 3.7% on the previous week. Average of 4,484 referrals per day over the past week. Of 4,413 new cases with known most likely transmission source notified within the past 2 weeks, 3,064 (69.4%) were close contacts. 255 (5.8%) were travel related, and 112 (2.5%) were acquired in healthcare settings (80 patients & 32 staff). 982 (22.2%) were community transmission (no other identified source). There was 1 ne w outbreak in nursing homes notified during the most recent week (0 for the previous week). There were 3 new outbreaks in residential institutions notified (4 for the previous week). There were 14 new outbreaks among vulnerable populations notified; 10 among members of the Irish traveller community; 1 among the homeless population, 1 among members of the Roma community and 2 in direct provision centres. While the vaccine programme is drawing on community resources it is having a positive impact with a re duction in staff absence. Community Services absence rates for March stands at 6.8% of which 2.2% (32.7% of the total) is also COVID - 19 related. Nationally, the HSE has published the 'Safe Return to Services' plan which notes the unprecedented interruption to normal healthcare activity, with both community and acute settings affected. While it is the intention of Community Services to fully support and deliver on the 'Safe Return to Services' plan, our ambition needs to be tempered with a degree of realism about the levels of service that can be provided for 2021. For the remainder of 2021 there will be ongoing challenges from redeployment to testing and tracing, the vaccination programme and there will likely be ongoing staff absences related to Covid, including 'long' Covid. Additional demands will be in relation to the ongoing requirement to deliver services in a social distant environment, productivity impacts related to the use of PPE and there will also be ongoing demands from the vaccination programmes. These will require input from staff across the Community Operations system and the requirement to vaccinate the whole population in a short period a time as possible will inevitably impact on our ability to deliver core services and address waiting lists that have grown across the course of the pandemic. The vaccination programme will, dependant on supply, operate across all of Q2 and likely in to Q3. It is also likely that as we enter Q4 and the winter period there will be requirement for 'booster' vaccination programmes particularly for vulnerable groups and those in long term care. The scenarios outlined above clearly suggest that there will be continued impact on services across 2021. Primary Care Primary Care Services continue to be the most impacted by the requirement to set up Covid Specific Services including the vaccination programme. This has inevitably impacted on the delivery of Primary Care services. While there has been a significant return of staff from Covid services to 'core duti es', there is still Performance Profile January -March 2021 40 significant impact on Primary Care services due to the pandemic. Staff are required to deliver services in a socially distant environment with a consequent impact on their ability to meet targets that were set for a non- pandemic servic e. Other challenges include reduced capacity, maintaining Covid 19 services, the impact of the vaccination programme and increased demand and wait lists as a result of the pandemic. The performance metrics need to be read in the context of staff deliver ing front line services within the foregoing constraints. The challenges detailed above relate to all the services reported on below. Overall there was a 94.3% return rate for data across Primary Care Services. Community Intervention Teams There were 15,956 CIT referrals year to date which is 6.6% ahead of the expected activity for the year of 14,972 (PC122) and 10.3% ahead of same period last year 14,460 * Data return rate 100% Child Health Developmental Assessment 12 Months The national performance a t February YTD is 43.3% compared to a target of 95.0% (PC1 53). In the performance management engagements with the CHO s they have been requested to prioritise this service and formal improvement plans are being developed. Again, it should be noted that serv ices are being delivered in a Covid environment and there are requirements to provide services in a safe environment for both children and staff. * Data return rate 90.6% % Oral Health Year to date nationally 80.1% of new Oral Health patients who commence d treatment within three months of scheduled oral health assessment , compared to the target of 90 % (PC 34A).

The same period last year was 63.5%. The number of clients waiting longer than 52 weeks has in creased by 3.5% from 5, 612 in February to 5, 807 in March (PC103E). Covid will impact the ability to achieve the full -year target. In light of Covid, services are being reconfigured to be delivered via new ways of working including phone consultations, telehealth , etc. Work is on- going with Mental Health Services to look at how best to provide digital online cognitive behavioural therapy services and other digital interventions to enhance service provision in this area. *Data return rate 100% Numbers of Patients Seen The following i s an analysis of the number of patients seen year to date within the therapy disciplines; Number of Patients Seen YTD March 2021 The reduction in capacity due to infection prevention and control measures and the need to maintain social distancing affects the delivery of services. Palliative Care Access to Palliative Inpatient Beds The national year to date position is 99.2% of admissions (target 98%) to a Specialist Palliative care inpatient unit were admitted within 7 days of active referral, compared to the performance of 98.1% in the same period last year (PAC1A). Access to Palliative Community Service The national year to date position is 82% of patients who waited for Specialist Palliative care services in a community setting were seen within 7 days (target 80%) compared to the performance of 81.9% in the same period last year (PAC9A). * Data return rate 100% Children's Palliative Care The number of children in the care of the specialist palliative care teams in March 2021 has decreased by 1 9 children compared to same period last year ( 64 in March 2020 vs. 45 in March 2021 ) (PAC39). The number of children in the care of the Children's Nurse Co- Ordinators was 287 at March 2021 has decreased by 29 children compared to 316 children at March 2020 (PAC37). Performance Profile January -March 2021 42 Mental Health CAMHS Inpatient Units Nationally there were 90 children admitted to CAMHS in- patient units at the end of March 2021 (MH 37). Close weekly monitoring at the n ational level of the activity and waitlist for in -patient services takes place with on- going engagement with the in-patient units and CHO areas as appropriate. The provision of CAMHS inpatient services depends on a combination of HSE and agency staff in the context of maintaining safe levels of staffing including meeting the needs of complex cases requiring special arrangements. 92.8% of child and adolescent mental health admissions were to child and adolescent acute inpatient units YTD which is above the target ( 85%) (MH5). 98.9% of b ed days used by c hildren/adolescent s were in Child and Adolescent Acute Inpatient Units YTD at end of March 2021 which is above 95% target (MH57). The number of c hildren admitted to adult mental health units has reduced during 2021 . The l atest available data to the end of March 2021 indicates that there were 7 child admissions to adult units. This is compared to a total of 27 child admissions to adult units in 2020 . Local protocols around ensuring that children are only placed in adult inpatient units when all alternative options have been exhausted are currently in place in all CHOs and are monitored and discussed weekly with national management where any instances are targeted to minimise the length of stay (MH38). Community CAMHS Nationally there was an in crease of 34 children on the waiting list for community mental health services from 2,591 in February to 2,625 in March 2021. There is a decrease of 191 childre n on the waiting list for community mental health services for the same period last year (MH50). There are 282 children waiting longer than 12 months in March, however, there are regional variances. CHO 2 and CHO 5 have no children waiting lon ger than 12 months to be seen. CHO1 have 53 , CHO3 ( 61), 7 (4), CHO8 (58) and CHO9 have 29 children waiting longer than 12 months to be seen by CAMHS (MH55). As of the end of March, 77.9% of referrals accepted by child and adolescent community teams nationally were offered an appointment within 12 weeks against a target of 78% (MH6). However, 94.5% of young people new or re- referred cases were seen within 12 months in community CAMHS services YTD March 2020 (MH72). Nationally , 96.4% of urgent r eferrals to CAMHS were responded to within three working days, above the 9 0% target. (MH73). * Data return rate 100% Community Adult mental health services 90.4% of referred patients were offered an appointment and seen within 12 weeks in general adult m ental health YTD March 2021 against a target of 90% (MH 1). CHOs, 8 and 9 are below target and this was discussed on engagement calls in February where action plans were discussed however Covid related contingencies make this more challenging to address. 17.3% referred to general adult patients did not at tend (DNA) their appointments . Again Covid makes this difficult to analyse. * Data return rate 95.7% 98.5% of referred patients in Psychiatry of Old Age services were offered an appointment within 12 weeks YTD March 2021 against a target of 98% (MH3). * Data return rate 93.7% Disability Services Children's Disability Networks The HSE is establishing a total of 91 Children's Disability Networks across each of the nine CHOs comprised of specialist Children's Disability Network Teams (CDNT) to work with children with complex disability needs and their families in an interdisciplinary, child and family centred approach. This reconfiguration of services under the Progressing Disability Services for Children & Young People (PDS) programme is in line with Health Service Reform and the implementation of Community Healthcare Networks under Sl\u00e1intecare. The 91 Children's Disability Networks (CDN) will align to 96 Community Healthcare Networks (CHNs) across the country and each Children's Disability Network will have one CDNT providing services and supports for children aged from birth to 18 Performance Profile January -March 2021 43 years of age. Early Intervention Teams and School Age Teams already in place are reconfiguring into 0- 18 CDNTs. On full reconfi guration of children's disability services into CDNTs, every child across the country with complex needs arising from their disability will have access to a Children's Disability Network Team. Significant progress is being made in line with the timeline for the reconfiguration of Children's Disability Network Teams. Children's Disability Network Managers (CDNMs) have been appointed to the majority of networks. The outstanding vacancies are currently being progressed through the job offer / contracting stage. Lead agencies for each of the networks have been agreed in all CHOs. A standardised CHO governance structure and processes has been agreed between the HSE and all agencies and is currently being implemented in all CHO areas. Expressions of preference f or staffing are also concluded in most areas. To date, 67 CDNs have been established and it is envisaged that the remaining 24 CDNs will be established by end Q2 2021. Please note that although the 2021 National Service Plan Cumulative Target identifies 96 Children's Disability Networks, we are now working towards a revised Target of 91 Networks that has been agreed by National Disability Offices and Community Operations and this is reflected in the KPI target. Residential Places There were 8,114 resi dential places for people with a disability in March 2021 which is - 0.2% (16) lower than the 8,130 profiled target (DIS108). This can be attributed to the loss of places in congregated settings that could not be re- utilised, which is in keeping with Government policy to move away from institutionalised settings (i.e. Time to Move On from Congregate Settings) where the state is actively implementing a policy that will have a bed reduction impact. The \"in- year\" capacity (bed) levels are also often impacted negatively as a result of regulatory requirements; that is, where an inspection outcome leads to capacity being reduced. Emergency Places In accordance with NSP 2021, Disability Services committed to developing 44 new emergency residential placements and 358 intensive transitional support packages for children and young people with complex/high support needs focusing on families experiencing substantial levels of support need, but who do not require a high-cost long term placement. At end of March 2021, 22 new emergency residential places were developed; while a further 159 intensive home support packages were put in place; this includes 91 new packages and 68 packages approved in 2020 against additional Q4 funding, which have been maintained in 2021. RT Pla ces There were 2,145 people (all disabilities) in receipt of Rehabilitative Training in March 2021, which is - 6.3% (145) less than the 2,290 profiled target (DIS14). This is mainly due to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic. Disability Act Compliance Activity for Quarter 1 indicates that there has been significant progress in the number of Assessment of Need reports completed during the Quarter. This has led to a significant reduction in the total number of applications 'overdue for completion', which no w stands at 3,103 (excluding those applications for which an extended time- frame was negotiated with the parent on the grounds of there being exceptional circumstances as provided for in paragraph 10 of the regulations) (DIS1). The increase in activity in Q1 can be attributed to the additional funding allocated to the AON process via Slaintecare. This has been utilised to provide additional assessments through a range of options including overtime for existing staff and private procurement. The infograph below shows the progress made in the last 6 months in relation to the backlog of overdue assessments, which has reduced from 5,879 in October to 1,919 at end of March 2021. (Note: This activity data refers only to those AONs that were overdue at 30/6/2020) Performance Profile January -March 2021 44 Congregated Settings A total of 35 people transitioned from congregated settings to homes in the Community in Q1 2021 (DIS55) . Time to Move On from Congregated Settings is progressing and continues to demonstrate very positive results for service us ers who have transitioned to living in homes in community settings. Overall, there are now less than 1,800 people remaining in congregated settings. The target for de- congregation for 202 1 was set at 144. Work remains on- going to address the key challenge s arising in relation to the procurement of appropriate housing in a buoyant housing market, and the undertaking of necessary works to ensure HIQA compliance - which must be secured before any new facility can become operational. * Data return rate 100% Older Persons Home Support Since 2018 activity data for Home Support for Older People is now reflected in terms of total hours and clients across the Home Support Service, being the totality of the amalgamated former Home Help Service and the HCP Scheme. This provides a much greater level of transpare ncy in relation to activity against targets. NSP 2021 provides for 23. 7 million home support hours to be delivered to 55,675 people and for 360,000 home support hours provided from Intensive Home Care Packages to be delivered to approximately 235 people by year end. This allocation comprehends an additional 5 million hours funded under the Winter Plan 2020/2021 and 230,000 hours relating to the Home Support Pilot Scheme which is to commence in 2021. The Winter Plan for 2020/2021 has been framed in the context of an increasing demand for unscheduled care, the need to support service continuity and resumption of services and delivering essential healthcare in the context of a pandemic. The Home Support initiativ es included in the Winter Plan provides for an additional 5m home support hours to be delivered by end of 2021. In order to ensure timely discharges from acute settings for older people, a discharge to assess approach will be utilised, which will be further enabled through the establishment of Integrated Decision Making Forum(s) alongside enhanced transitional and short -stay bed capacity. Performance Profile January -March 2021 45 One of the key enablers of the home support scheme is the implementation of the InterRAI tool in Ireland. In 2021, Inter RAI will be fully implemented across Ireland. Key to this will be: (1) the recruitment and training of 128 InterRAI assessor resources who will work in the community; and (2) the development of operational policies / procedures to deliver the operationalis ation of the assessment through to service provision process (across community and acute settings). Successful implementation of these processes is a key dependency to the establishment of the statutory home support scheme. At the end of March (YTD) it was expected that the Home Support Service would deliver 5,301,734 hours. The data reported indicates that 4,686,335 hours were provided, a variance of - 11.6% (OP53) with 5 4,122 people in receipt of home support (OP54) and 1 40 people in receipt of an Int ensiv e Home Care Package (OP4). The recent surge in COVID -19 has had an impact on the delivery of home support services with a number of COVID -19 positive/suspect clients and staff across the CHOs. As at end March, 3,327 clients' service was temporarily suspended, of which 2,750 were suspended by the client/family and the balance of 577 suspended by the HSE, impacting on the total number of hours delivered in the reporting period by 16,740 hours of service per week. Despite the significant resource allocated t o home support demand for home support continues to exceed the level of service that can be funded. Waiting lists for Home Support have become a feature of the service as resources have not kept pace with population growth, or with the increasing dependenc y of the growing numbers of people aged 80years, within the over 65 years' cohort. The CHO waiting lists as at end of March indicates that 1, 601 people were waiting for home support funding (OP55) (preliminary data). All those waiting are assessed and people being discharged from acute hospitals, who are in a position to return home with supports, are prioritised. There has been a significant reduction in the number of people assessed and waiting on funding for home support over the course of 2020 as a result of a number of factors including validation of waiting lists and availability of funding to address those waiting. Further funding 2021, as part of the Winter Plan 2020/2021, will enable the HSE to keep the number of clients assessed and waiting on funding to a minimum. * Data return rate 100% NHSS In March 2021 the Nursing Homes Support Scheme funded 21,710 long term public and private residential places, and when adjusted for clients not in payment, there were 22,679 plac es supported under the sche me. The number of people funded under the scheme is belo w the profile for March 22,624. There is a decrease of 1,994 in the number of people supported under the scheme when compared to the same period last year. This is a decrease of 8.4% in activity year on year. The number on the placement list at the end of March 2021 is 569 (March 2020 - 395). This is an increase of 174 (44.1%) on the same period last year. A total of 1,504 people were approved for funding under the scheme in the first three months of 2021 compared to 2,463 people approved for the same period last year. This is a decrease of 959 approvals or 39% year on year. In the first three months of 2021 2,330 applications were received and 1,561 clients went into care and were funded under t he scheme in public and private nursing homes. This is a decrease of 996 or 39% in the number of starters supported under the scheme when compared to 2020. The scheme took on new clients within the limits of the resources available, in accordance with the legislation and Government policy and HSE Service Plan 2021. While there has been a significant drop in the number of clients supported by NHSS during the Covid- 19 period, particularly during outbreak waves, current indicators point to an increase in appl ications and take- up of funding places over the coming months. The high degree of uncertainty within society makes the provision of robust projections very difficult . Performance Profile January -March 2021 46 Transitional Care Funding Transitional Care Funding which is in place to assist Acute Hospitals with discharge of patients who are finalising their Nursing Home Support Application or in need of a period of convalescence care before returning home has continued to be demand in 2021. In February 2021 502 people were approved for Transitional Care Funding to discharge from Acute Hospitals to nursing home beds - 356 approvals were for NHSS applicants and 146 were for convalescence care. This is against a monthly target of 600 approvals for February 2021 Social Inclusion Opioid substitution Social inclusion continues to operate at similar levels to that of pre- COVID 19. Total number of clients in receipt of opioid substitution treatment (outside prisons) as of the end of February was 10,729 and is 2.5% over the expected activity level of 10,464 (SI1) Data return 0% Homeless Service 82.7% of service users admitted to homeless emergency accommodation hostels / facilities whose health needs have been assessed within two weeks of admission in 2021 against a target of 85% (SI52) * Data return rat e 100% Population Health & Wellbeing MECC MECC eLearning has been available throughout 2021 with improved access and minimal navigation issues for online participants. 385 staff completed the eLearning YTD March 2021 despite the Covid challenge (HWB94). T he number of staff to complete the face to face/ virtual module of Making Every Contact Count training YTD March 2021 is 19 compared to YTD target of 133. Performance has been significantly impacted by Covid- 19 as face to face workshops were cancelled in March 2020 and have not resumed. There is on- going participation in the HRB Applied Partnership Award entitled \"Implementation of Making Every Contact Count (MECC): Developing a collaborative strategy to optimise and scale- up MECC \" to develop an implementation strategy to successfully roll -out the programme in Ireland. Tobacco smokers - intensive cessation support Intensive cessation support is a consultation of more than ten minutes provided by a trained tobacco cessation specialist to a smoker in an acute or community setting. It can be delivered in a variety of ways - face to face (one t o one), group or via telephone. Smoking cessation is a highly cost -effective intervention. Seven out of ten smokers want to quit and four out of ten make a quit attempt ev ery year. Support doubles a smoker's chance of quitting successfully. Metric performance is reported quarterly, one quarter in arrears. Nationally, 7,098 smokers received intensive cessation support from a cessation counselor YTD December 2020, which is - 29% below the annual target of 10,000 smokers (HWB27). Two out of the nine CHOs achieved or exceeded their target YTD with the best perform ers being CHO1 (+27.2%), CHO 5 (+125.3%) and IE Hospital Group (+12.3%) . In contrast, t he performance outliers Group ( -78.5%). Underperformance can be attributed to vacancies in some services and the cancellation of smoking cessation clinics due to staff redeploy ed during the COVID -19 pandemic. Addition ally, the new campaign (QUIT for 28 days) including TV adverts was paused due to the Covid - 19 pandemic. Prior to this, the QUIT campaign was working very effectively in motivating quit attempts. However, overall in 2020 there was a 20% increase in the number people signing up for online support to quit and a 24% increase in visits to Quit.ie . Market research on the Quit campaign found that 1 in 4 people who smoke are going to try to quit for 28 days having seen the campaign. Over one in three people who smoke said they intend to use the HSE Quit, an increase of 14% on 2019. The Tobacco Free Ireland (TFI) programme continues to engage with Hospital Groups and CHOs in relation to smoking cessation support. Online Cess ation Support Services 2,508 (+23.5%) people received online cessation support services during Q1 2021 (HWB101) i.e. signed up for and subsequently activated a QUIT Plan on www.quit.ie . There was strong performance in onl ine activity and traffic to www.quit.ie throughout 2020. The temporary pausing of face to face stop smoking Performance Profile January -March 2021 47 services due to COVID -19 has contributed to this uplift in seeking support through digital channels. % of smoker s quit at four weeks This metric measures the percentage of smokers who have signed up to the standardised HSE tobacco cessation support programme, who have set a quit date and who are quit at four weeks and is reported quarterly, one quarter in arrears. Nationally, 52.5% of smokers remained quit at four weeks YTD December 2020 which is above the target of 45% (HWB26). Population Health Protection - Vaccinations The World Health Organisation (WHO) has listed vaccine hesitancy among a number of global healt h threats. The WHO said that vaccination currently prevents up to three million deaths a year, and a further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improved. The Vaccine Alliance established by the DoH is aimed at boosting the upt ake of childhood vaccines and reducing vaccine hesitancy. This alliance is comprised of healthcare professionals, policymakers, patient advocates, students and representatives from groups most affected by vaccine hesitancy. Vaccination uptake below targeted levels presents a public health risk in terms of the spread of infectious disease and outbreaks as herd immunity declines. Herd immunity is a form of immunity that occurs when the vaccination of a significant portion of a population (or herd) provides a measure of protection for individuals who have not developed immunity. Public Health and the National Immunisation Office engage with Community Healthcare Operations supporting them to maximise the uptake of all publicly funded immunisation programmes t hrough (1) the provision of advice regarding best practice and standardised delivery of immunisation programmes and (2) the development of national communication campaigns designed to promote immunisation uptake rates and provide accurate and trusted infor mation to the public, healthcare professionals and staff, including working with the Vaccine Alliance. This approach is similar to the successful approach taken to increase the uptake of the HPV vacci ne in girls over recent years. % of children aged 24 months who have received the 6- in-1 vaccine - (6in1 Vaccine) The 6 in 1 vaccine protects children against six diseases: Diphtheria, Hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib), pertussis (whooping cough), polio and tetanus, all of which are very serious illnesses that can lead to death. Due to the prioritised response to the Covid- 19 pandemic, immunisation uptake data was incomplete for the Q4 reporting period (i.e. this metric is r eported quarterly in arrears). Nationally, the uptake rate for the 6- in-1 vaccine YTD (Q1 - Q4 2020) ( -0.9%) (HWB4). *Data return 96.9% Performance Notice The Performance Notices in place at St John of God's Community Services and Stewarts Care will be paused.

Similarly, during the first lockdown, we observed a significant reduction in emergency presentations and admissions of the order of 25.5% and 22% respectively during the same period. There was a gradual restoration in elective activity following the first surge, between July and Septem ber 2020 with activity in September 2020 operating at 97.8% of 2019 levels. However, in response to lockdown measures in Quarter 4 there was a reduction in emergency activity again in Quarter 4 of the order of 10%. The cumulative effect of lockdown measures and curtailment of non-urgent electives was a total reduction of 11.4 % on total inpatient discharges. The Service Plan targets for 2021 sought to take account of the potential ongoing impact of COVID on elective and emergency activity. However, the third surge in Quarter 1 had a significant impact on demand for acute beds and critical care beds beyond our planning assumptions. As a consequence, it was necessary to curtail non- essential elective activity again. Emergency attendances also fell significantly. As a result, YTD February 2020 total discharges are down significantly by 28 % when compared with 2019. Hospital discharge data is produced one month in arrears. March data is available for outpatient activity and emergency department attendances and it shows a significant recovery in these areas equivalent to 2019 levels. We would expect that a similar recovery pattern will be observed in March emergency discharges when the March data is available. In relation to elective services, all non- essential elective activity was curtailed in line with clinical advices. The Safety Net Agreement with Private Hospitals remained in place between end January and March and this facilitated continued delivery of time dependent and urgent care p atients in private hospitals at this difficult time . The positive impact of the vaccination programme is evident in the reduction of numbers of hospital acquired COVID, outbreaks in hospital st aff and COVID ICU admissions. However, there are ongoing challenges in effecting full recovery because of additional measures required to reduce the risk of transmission. These include PPE, a dditional cleaning, and additional pre- assessment measures for patients and necessary redeplo yment of staff for vaccination. The necessary redeployment of clinical and administrative staff to support the vaccination programme is also a factor. It should also be noted that, as at time of writing, the 14 day incidence is still above 200 in parts of Dublin and as a result, there is a need for careful and phased restoration of services. Emergency Department (ED) Performance (including Local injury units and other emergency presentations) The overall trend in ED presentations is directly affected by the Pandemic and reductions in attendances appear to closel y align with the implementation of Level 5 measures There were 290,581, emergency presentations year to date March 2021. This is a decrease of 8.9% on emergency presentations for the corresponding period in 2020 and 22.1% behind year to date 2019. Year to date March 2021 ED attendances are behind the target of 339,497 by 14.4%. There were 113,312 emergency presentations in March 2021 which was an increase of 28.7% (25,266) on the same month last year and a decrease of 12.9% on March 2019. New Emergency Department Attendances year to date March 2021 are 13.8% (38,750) behind target and a reduction of 8.2% (21,648) when compared with Jan Feb MarYear Profile January -March 2021 63 the same period last year 2020. Year to date March 2021 is 28.2% (73,398) lower than the corresponding figure in 2019 There were 94,095 new ED attendances in the month of March 2021 which was an increase of 27.8% (20,457) when compared with the previous month February 2021; and a n increase of 22.2% when compared with the same period last year. March 2021 new ED attendances ar e 12.5% (13,418) lower than March 2019 The number of admissions from ED year to date March 2021 was 75,276 which was a decrease of 4.7% (3,710) on the same period in 2020 and 16.2% down on March 2019. There were 27,967 admissions in March 2021 which was do wn 23.6% on March 2020., and 7.6% lower than March 2019 Of the patients who attended ED year to date March 2021, 28.7% were admitted - an increase from 27.6% for the same period last year. Of note, 56.2% of patients aged over 75 years, who attended ED , were admitted. This is an increase from 55.2% year to date March 2020. The impact of COVID is a clear factor in this trend. 98.4% of all patients attending ED were seen within 24 hours in March 2021, (same percentage as February 2021). 20 of the 28 Emer gency Departments exceeded the ED PET less than 24 hours target of 97% in March 2021. This compares with 98.5% in March 2020 when 26 EDs were compliant with the target of 97%. 14 EDs were compliant in March 2019 with an overall rate of 96.3% ED PET less than 24 hours for patients aged 75+ was 96.1% in March 2021, a slight decrease in compliance from 9 6.5% in February 2021. This compares with 96.3% in March 2020 (surge 1) and a significant increase on 89.9% in March 2019. 67.9% of patients over 75 were dis charged or admitted within 9 hours in March 2021, a decrease from 68.9% in February. This compares with 73.3% in March 2020 ( surge 1) and a significant increase on the compliance of 56.8% in March 2019 46.8% of patients over 75 were discharged or admit ted within 6 hours in March 2021, a decrease from 47.6% in February. This compares with 53.3% in March 2020 ( surge 1) but represents a significant increase in compliance of 38.9% in March 2019 In 2020, 426 beds were opened temporarily through COVID funding. These beds are now funded permanently through the 2021 Estimates. In addition, we opened 386 additional beds as part of our Winter Planning process. These beds will also remain open throughout 2021 and are funded per manently in the Estimates 2021. In total we have opened 834 beds out of the 1152 that were planned through the Wi nter Plan and NSP initiatives. 222 beds are profiled to open from April 2021 onwards. Average Acute Bed occupancy in March was 84.0% this is an increase from 80.7% in February. I n March 2020, the comparable occupancy figure was 74.5% occupancy during surge 1 and 95.5% in March 2019 The overall reduced occupancy levels in 2021 reflects an increase in the number of vacant and closed beds in some hospitals due to the effect of COVI D 19 on services and the curtailment of non- urgent elective work in response to the third surge. Average Acute Bed occupancy in March was 84.0% this is an increase from 80.7% in February. In March 2020, the comparable occupancy figure was 74.5% occupancy during surge 1 and 95.5% in March 2019 The overall reduced occupancy levels in 2021 reflects an increase in the number of vacant and closed beds in some hospitals due to the effect of COVID 19 on services and the curtailment of non- urgent elective work in response to the third surge. The average number of closed beds due to infection or other reasons in Mar ch 2021 was 352. The comparable figure in 2020 was 162. Key factors are COVID outbreaks, staff absenteeism due to COVID and staff redeployment to suppor t critical care and other areas. The average number of vacant beds in March was 439, a decrease from an average of 517 in February 2021 (Source HSE SDU) Jan Performance Profile January -March 2021 64 Delayed Transfers of Care (DTOC) There was 371 Delayed Transfers of Care at the end of March 2021 which is an increase of 55.9% on the same month last year; but a decrease of 255 (40.7%) from the number of DTOCs in 2019. The 371 reported in March 2021 included 56 patients waiting to go home and 155 waiting on long term residential care. The DTOC categories are listed in Table 1 below: Delayed Transfer of Care Categories: End March 2021 Home 56 Residential Care 155 Rehab 45 Complex Needs 26 Housing/Homeless 18 Legal complexity 39 Non compliance 10 COVID -19 22 Total 371 Inpatient/Day Case Discharges (based on HIPE data which is one month in arrears) In December 2020, a S afety Net II Agreement (SNII) was negotiated and agreed upon with legal entities that control 18 of the main private hospital sites in the country. Private hospitals are providing urgent and time- critical care predominantly for NON -COVID patients. The SLA also provides for COVID positive patients to be cared for in private hospitals in exceptional circumstances. The SNII was triggered on 20 th January 2021 and allowed for the transf er of urgent time dependent elective cases and unscheduled care to be transferred to Private Hospitals i n response to the third surge. The Chief Clinical Officer issued guidance to public hospitals on 12th January 2021 regarding the curtailing of non- essential activity during the period of surge. As a result, overall activity levels are lower year to date February. This agreement remains in place with the Dublin hospitals and Limerick in line with the clinical triggers. It ceased in other hospitals from 26 March 2021 Day Case Discharges (including dialysis) There were 128,817 Day case discharges year to date February 2021 and 188,838 for the corresponding period in 2020 which is a decrease of 31.8%. The number of day case procedures in February 2021 was 65, 396 versus 91,331 in the same period in 2020 that is, a decrease of 25,935 (28.4%) cases. Day Cay Case discharges in February 2021 were 3.1% higher than the previous month January 2021. The decrease in activity relates to the clinical decision to curtail elective acidity in response to the third surge and also the impact of COVID outbreaks at individual hospital sites . The transfer of time dependent work to the private hospital sector will offset partially the loss of elective work in the public hospital system Inpatient Discharges There were 80,965 inpatient discharges year to date February 2021 and 102,594 for the corresponding period in 2020 which is a decrease of 21.1%. The number of inpatient discharges was 40,227 in February 2021 versus 49,670 for the corresponding period in 202 0, that is, a decrease of 19%. Inpatient discharges in February 2021 were 1.3% lower than the previous month January 2021 Elective Inpatient Discharges* (excluding the stand- alone Maternity Hospitals*) There were 7,677* elective inpatient discharges year to date February 2021 and 14,318* for the corresponding period in 2020 which is a decrease of 46.4%. There were 4,057* elective inpatient discharges in February 2021 versus 7,488 * for the corresponding period in 2020, which is a decrease of 45.8%. Elective inpatient discharges* in February 2021 were 12.1% increase than the previous month of January 2021 *Note: Acute Operations has engaged with the Healthcare Pricing Office regarding the timing of coding of data at the stand -alone maternity hospitals; this is being addressed by HPO with the hospitals and it is hoped to be resolved shortly . Performance Profile January -March 2021 65 Emergency Inpatient Discharges There were 58,058 emergency inpatient discharges year to date February 2021 and 70,854 for the corresponding period in 2020 which is a decrease of 18.1%. There were 28,751 emergency inpatient discharges in February 2021 versus 33,815 for the corresponding period in 2020, that is, a decrease of 15.0% Emergency inpatient discharges in February 2021 were 1.9% l ower than the previous month. The reduction in emergency discharges in February 2021 is linked to the reduced number of emergency attendances which is a result of the third surge attendances as a result of the Pandemic. Maternity Inpatient Discharges There were 15,004 maternity inpatient discharges year to date February 2021 and 17,196 for the corresponding period in 2020 which is a decrease of 2,192 (12.7%). There were 7,248 maternity inpatient discharges in February 2021 and 8,245 for the corresponding period in 2020 which is a decrease of 997 (12.1%). Maternity inpatient discharges in February 2021 were 6.5% less than the previous month. Out Patient Department Attendances The number of new and return outpatient attendances was 763,845 year to date March 2021 versus 787,964 for the corresponding period in 2020, which is a decrease of 3.1%. New and return outpatient attendances year to date were 1.7% lower than the target of 776,850. The number of new and return attendances for the month of March 2021 296,727 represents a significant increase in the activity compared with January (225,957) and February 2021 (241,161). When total attendances for the month of March 2021 are compared with March 2020 there is an increase of 84,225 or 39.6% (i.e. surge 1); when compared with March 2019, the increase is 19,423 or 7.0% . Provisional data for year to date March 2021 indicates a total of 227,122 virtual outpatient consultations took place; 67,997 consultations took place in March alone. Delivery of virtual consultat ions has been a key factor in supporting continuity during periods of surge and enabling early recovery. There has been a considerable increase in \"virtual\" outpatient activity that has taken place since April 2020. Acute Operations have taken on an extensive piece of work with the office of the National Clinic Advisory and Group Lead (NCAGL), Clinical Programmes, Hospital Groups and the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OoCIO) to support the roll -out of enabling technologies to support, maintain and expand virtual outpatient consultations. Virtual consultations are taking place both over the phone and with the use of software to support face to face engagement with patients. The primary focus of virtual engagements has been around outpatient services up until this point however the technology is now being planned for use for other virtual engagements e.g. health and social care professional patient engagements. We are continuing to work extensively with the office of the OoCIO to progress the virtual movement taki ng place in our health system. The HSE continues to examine other options for delivering OPD activity including the use of off -site locations . Waiting Lists A key issue for 2021 is the on- going impact of COVID -19 in terms of a sustained nega tive impact on waiting lists. The third surge has exacerbated existing challenges in terms of occupancy and safe distance requirements and potential COVID related outbreaks. While the vaccination is having an impact on staff contracting COVID, there are s till challenges in terms of high risk staff groups and the requirements associated with isolation of close contacts. Access to Care Plan In the 2021 Access to Care Plan, the HSE, in collaboration with the NTPF and private providers, seek s to maximise act ivity for those patients who are waiting the longest for access to scheduled care and those whose care, both urgent and non- urgent, has been impacted by service challenges during the pandemic. This activity will be funded by a combination of HSE core fundi ng, optimising the resources within the access to care fund of \u20ac210m, Sl\u00e1intecare redesign fund and NTPF funding of \u20ac130m. The summary of service provision is outlined below as follows: Increased Public Activity NTPF Activity Performance Profile January -March 2021 66 Targeted private activity GI scope/endoscopy. Inpatient/Day Case Waiting Lists In March 2021 the number of IPDC patients waiting was 79,973 which represents a reduction of 963 or 1.2% on February 2021 This figure has reduced by 0.6%(963 patients) since the waiting for an inpat ient or day case appointment in March 2021 is higher than the number waiting at the end of March 2020 by 2.9% ( 2,225 patients) and higher by 13.9% (9,754) when compared with March 2019. This is directly a result of the services being restricted to urgent and time -critical patient access in light of the pandemic. The sustained improvement in waiting lists observed in the second half of 2020 as the system recovered from the first surge was reversed as a result of the necessary measures take during third surge. The March results point to early signs of recovery as the system re- establishes elective activity. The National Service Plan (NSP) 2021 target is that 85% of adults on the inpatient waiting list will wait less than 15 months for an inpatient procedure, 95% will be waiting less than 15 months for a day case procedure. By the end of March, compliance with wait time targets is as set out below: Waiting times Adult Inpatients Waiting List Compliance was 72.5%, below NSP 2021 target of 85% Adult Day Wait ing List Compliance was 82 .4%, below the target of 95% Children's Inpatient Waiting List Compliance was 73.5%, below the target of 95% Children's Day Case Waiting List Compliance was 78.0%, below the target of 90%. Colonoscopy Waiting List The National Service Plan (NSP) 2021 target is that 65% of adults on the inpatient waiting list will wait less than 13 weeks for a colonoscopy or OGD ( Oesophago- Gastro- Duodenoscopy ). The impact of COVID 19 has been significant in terms of the requirement to curtail routine elective work particularly during periods of surge. Unit closures/reductions in service, staff redeployment and leave as a result of COVID are further straining services. This was evident again in Q1 2021 due to the third surge when elective activity l evels were curtailed once more, and the volume of scopes carried out was reduced. At the end of March 2021 , the number of people on the Colonos copy/OGD waiting list was 35,634. This is a decrease of 1,186 (3. 2%) on the number waiting at the end of Februar y 2021. The number waiting at the end of March 2021 shows an increase of 7,430 (26.3% ) in March 2020, and an increase of 13,442 (60.6%) when compared with March 2019 32.7% of patients were waiting less than the target time of 13 weeks in March 2021. This is a decrease from 54.0% in March 2020 and 50.7% in March 2019 National Endoscopy Action Plan An updated National Endoscopy Action P lan has been developed by the HSE Acute Operations Endoscopy Steering Committee and has prioritised initiatives for 2021 onwards to address deficits in endoscopy services which have been exacerbated by COVID -19. There is an emphasis on commencing/funding demand management initiatives. Overall, the key points of the action plan include: Performance Profile January -March 2021 67 o Increase the volume of referrals tria ged by nurses to ensure patients are directed to the most appropriate intervention, or not added to the waiting list where clinically indicated. o Use stool tests taken by patients at home (FIT tests), rather than a colonoscopy in order to diagnose certain d iseases, discharge patients or safely defer patients to a later date. o Use more capsule endoscopies (PillCam) as an alternative to colonoscopies. o Publish de -anonymised (to hospital level, not individual clinician level) NQAIS Endoscopy data to further strengthen quality improvement and clinical governance in GI endoscopy. o Delivery increased activity in public and private units to recover lost activity in 2020 o Continue to support endoscopy units to achieve external accreditation. o Harness NTPF support for cli nical validation as well as funding additional day case scopes in the public and private sector. o Support increased capital investment in endoscopy units Outpatient Waiting Lists Wait time target The National Service Plan 2021 target is that 75% of people on the outpatient waiting list will be waiting less than 52 weeks for an outpatient appointment. Compliance with this target was 54.9% in March 2021. This is a decrease from 55.2% in February 2021. Volume of patients waiting The total number of people waiting for an Outpatient appointment was 628,756 at the end of March 2021 which is an increase of 1,861 since the end of February 2021 . The number waiting at the end of March 2021 shows an increase of 66,063 (11.7%) in March 2020, and an increase of 82, 126 (15.0% when compared with March 2019 As a result of the impact of COVID up until May 2020 only emergency or time dependent face to face, outpatient activity was taking place. Consequently, there was a significant reduction in all scheduled outpatient activity associated with the impact of COVID -19. In the latter months of 2020, the volumes of patients seen increased back to levels similar to 2019 volumes. This was supported by the use of virtual clinics which has been deploye d to mitigate some of this loss. However, it has in terms of some limitations in terms of seeing all new patients and accordingly the impact that is primarily on review patients. A key issue in 2021 is the likelihood of a sustained adverse impact on waiting lists, in particular in terms of new patient volumes, due to the occupancy and safe distance requirements arising from COVID. The Access to Care Plan is targeting additional activity in the public and private sector. NTPF/HSE Waiting List Validation As of year -end March 2021, the total number of patients validated in Acute Hospitals, for OPD and IPDC including scopes is 90,989 . Of this total, 14,098 (circa 15%) patients have been removed from the waiting list. Removals of appointments from the Outpatient waiting list removal s are 12,714 and 1384 from the Inpatient Day Case (including scopes) waiting list as at end of March 2021. Citywest The Citywest Convention centre has a total area of 16,499 sq. m (177,000 sq. ft.) This is spread over three floors, with the main conventi on space on the ground floor. There are six plenary rooms and a number of breakout rooms are also available, most of which are equipped with high- specification audio- visual facilities and offering natural light The convention centre can provide infrastruct ure to support patient care in a number of key service areas examples of service types outlined below: OPD Face to Face Consultations OPD Virtual Consultations Low complexity Day Case Activities Screening/Immunisation programmes COVID Vaccine Clinics Rehab (face to face and virtually) In March 2021, 2,644 patients were seen in the Citywest Campus. A total of 4,345 patients have been seen year to date in 2021. Active initiatives include: Glaucoma Testing - Ireland East Hospital Group, Performance Profile January -March 2021 68 Mass immunis ation for children of age - HPV /Tdap, Orthopaedic OPD - Children's Health Ireland Rheumatology Virtual - Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, Coombe Obstetrics Clinic, Neurology Virtual OPD - Dublin Midlands Hospital Group Connected Health Proposal Citywest On 22nd February 2021, the HSE started a new initiative providing a medically led Rehabilitation Exercise Programme to support patient rehab in particular in the context of post COVID patient recovery on the Citywest campus . The Programme has been developed and adapted with safety in mind and is in line with the government regulations associated with social distancing and other COVID related measures. This model has been successfully tested in Tallaght University Hospital and in Clont arf Orthopaedic Hospital. The plan includes classes 5 days a week with 3 classes held per day, with 15 patients in each class for an initial period of 3 months. The Programme offers the opportunity for large numbers of patients to access the rehab service in a safe environment that have diverse chronic illnesses or post COVID related illnesses. BowelScreen The BowelScreen target is that 90% of patients are scheduled within 20 days. Invitations for BowelScreen were paused on Wednesday 18 March 2020 due to COVID -19. Invitations have resumed and are being managed depending on capacity wi thin the individual units. In March 2021, 185 invitations issued of which 91.9% were scheduled within the target time of 20 days. Cancer Services During the Pandemic al l rapid access clinics continued, albeit with a combination of face to face consultation and virtual consultations as deemed clinically appropriate. However, all clinics are still constrained in overall capacity in line with government, NPHET and Infection Control guidelines as a result of Covid- 19 restrictions, social distancing requirements to ensure patient and staff safety. NCCP note s that the dramatic fall in e- Referrals noted in Wave 1 of the Covid- 19 pandemic, did not recur during Wave 2 and 3. E-Referrals to Cancer Rapid Access Services Symptomatic Breast: Current indications are that breast e- referrals are exceeding 2019 levels and are suggestive of some unmet need built up from 2020 now presenting in 202 1 (source Healthlink via NCCP). There w as no reduction in referrals during the third surge. Total breast electronic referrals for the period March 2021 year to date are 33.8% higher than the same period in 2019. Rapid Access Lung The number of e- referrals to the Rapid Access Lung Cancer (RALC) services year to date March 2021 is running at 9.7% lower than 2019 . when March e - referrals are looked at in isolation, it suggests that they are at similar levels to 2019 ( DATA) Rapid Access Prostate E-referrals to the Rapid Access Prostate Cancer (RAPC) services year to date March 2021 are 4.7% lower than 2019 for year to date 2021. March 2021 data for prostate referrals suggest that e- referrals are back at similar levels seen in 2019. Symptomatic Breast Cancer Clinics Five of the nine Symptom atic Breast Cancer Sites were compliant with the target of 95% in March 2021: University Hospital Limerick - 100.00% Beaumont Hospital - 99.6% St Vincent's Hospital - 99.2% Letterkenny University Hospital - 96.4% University Hospital Waterford - 96.3% One hospital was marginally below the target Cork University Hospital - 91.7% Three hospitals were below the target: St James's Hospital - 60.9% Galway University Hospital - 31.5% Performance Profile January -March 2021 69 Mater Misericordiae University Hospital - 23.4% Rapid Access Clinics for Lung Cancer Services Five hospitals achieved were compliant with the 95% target in March 2021, St Vincent's University Hospital - 100.0% Mater Misericordiae U niversity Hospital - 100% Beaumont Hospital - 100.0% Galway University Hospital - 98.6% Cork Uni versity Hospital - 96.0% Two hospital s were below the target of 10 days: University Hospital Limerick - 80.0% University Hospital Waterford - 75.9% Rapid Access Clinic for Prostate Cancer Services Four hospitals were compliant with 90% target in March 2021: Mater Misericordiae University Hospital - 100.0 % St Vinc ent's University Hospital - 100.0% Beaumont Hospital - 100.0% St James's Hospital - 90.6% Four hospitals were below target of 20 days: University Hospital Limerick - 51.7% University Hospital Waterford - 30.8% Cork University Hospital - 30.4% Galway University Hospital - 22.0% Given the sustained capacity of challenges in relation to Prostate Cancer Acute Operations is engaging with NCCP and Hospital Groups to determine the appropriate capaci ty and capability measures required to deliver sustained improvement. Radiotherapy The target is that 90% of patients commence treatment within 15 working days of the patient being deemed ready to treat target. In March 2021 compliance was as follows: Waterford was 100% compliant with the NSP target Limerick 100% - Network (SLRON) - 78.5% Cork - 40.6% Addressing Non Compliance In terms of addressing the areas of non- compliance, it is important to note that while the RACs cont inued to operate throughout COVID, the number of referrals fell. As a result, some sites are seeing an increase in the numbers to be seen. The NCCP is undertaking a review of performance by site in conjunction with the relevant clinical needs and Acute Operations to determine key causal factors for under compliance and an improvement plan will be agreed for each site. Performance and Accountability Framework The following is a summary of those areas escalated under the Performance and Accountability Framework that are the subject a performance notice by NPOG St James's Hospital Symptomatic Breast Cancer Services The Dublin Midlands Hospital Group issued a Performance Notice to St James's Hospital in October 2018 having regard to its non- compliance with the access targets for referrals to the symptomatic breast cancer clinic. A series of escalation meetings were held during 2018 and an improvement plan was agreed with the Group and SJH. As a result, the compliance with the targets improved for a limited period. Following continued deterioration in performance during 2019, further escalation meetings were convened and it culminated in St James Hospital CEO attending the NPOG meeting in November 2019 to agree a sustainable plan. Arising from that meeting, an action plan was agreed. It included the appointment of a breast physician, which has contributed to an improved per formance since December 2020. In terms of supporting a sustained improvement, the hospital has undertaken a further detailed review of the p erformance in conjunction with relevant clinical leads. A number of key actions and interventions were agreed arising from the review and an improvement plan has been agreed with G roup, Acute Operations and the NCCP which includes an improvement trajectory to deliver full compliance. The NCCP is satisfied that the improvement plan is being implemented and that the majority of patients are being Performance Profile January -March 2021 70 seen within a clinically acceptable time. It is noted that the number of attendances in March was up by over 30% on February levels; it is believed that this represents the lagged effect of restrictions on GP services in 2020 as a result of the Pandemic. It has been agreed that the hospital will remain in Level 3 es calation. It was also agreed, cognisant of the PAF20 20, the organisational performance improvement plans in place and timelines required to deliver on planned improvements that a pause on Performance Notices in place at St James's Hospital, be recommended to the Hospital Group. The National Director will follow up directly with services and keep NPOG apprised of implementation of each performance improvement plan. Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAI) There were 37 cases of hospital acquired Staphylococcus Aureus blood stream Infections and 5 6 cases of C lostridium Difficile infection reported by hospitals in March. It is important to acknowledge that national averages and uniform targets do not take full account of variation in the case mix of hospitals. Adjustments based on bed days therefore do not fully account for variations between hospitals. It is important therefore to consider results for each Hospital Group and each hospital in the context of its own baseline and to consider that some month to month variation is to be expected. There were 40 new cases of Carbapenemase Producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) reported by hospitals in March. The HSE have an established governance structure and arrangements for Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control. This was first established in May 2018 i n response to the Public Health Emergency on CPE. This was reviewed in late 2018 and from January 2019, the scope was extended to cover governance across all antimicrobial resistance and infection control (including HCAIs). This was further reviewed and updated in April 2020 to further expand and reflect the extent to which COVID -19 had come to dominate this area of work 6 AS1 - 112/ 999 emergency and urgent calls AS2 - Urgent calls received from a general practitioner or other medical sources National Ambulance Service Activity volume for AS16 and AS27 calls received this month has decreased by 6,563 calls ( -19%) compared to the same month last year (March 2020) The daily average call rate for AS1 1 and AS2 2 calls received this month was 875 (31 days this month) ECHO (life -threatening cardiac or respiratory arrest) incidents responded to within the target timeframe of 80% in 18 minutes and 59 seconds was above target at 82% this month. This is an increase of 5% compared to last month i.e. February 2021 ECHO calls increase by 3% (15) compared to the same month last year. DELTA (life -threatening illness or injury, other than car diac or respiratory arrest) incidents responded to within the expected activity timeframe of 70% in 18 minutes and 59 seconds was below target at 53% this month. Nationally there was a 22% (3,125) decrease in DELTA call activity compared to the same month last year. 82% of all inter hospital transfer requests were managed by the NAS Intermediate Care Service this month. Continuous monitoring of Emergency Departments' turnaround times is displaying a negative in relation to releasing ambulances, and a dow nward trajectory is noted. As a result there is pressure in achieving response time targets, which can compromise patient care and service delivery. o 33% of vehicles were released and had their crews and vehicles available to respond to further calls withi n 30 minutes or less, o compared to 36% of vehicles being released within 30 minutes or less last year (March 2020) o 86% of vehicles were released from Emergency Departments and had their crews and vehicles available to respond to further calls within 60 minutes or less, compared to 83% of vehicles being released within 60 minutes or less last year (March 2020). Performance Profile January -March 2021 71 Human Resources The WTE for Acute Operations in March 2021 was 67,878, this was an increase of 322 WTE on February 2021, (a 0.5% increase) and an i ncrease of 1,438 WTE YTD (a 2.2% increase). In Acute Operations there were increases across all staff categories in March, apart from Patient & Client Care which was down - 0.3%. There was an increase of 0.7% in Nursing & Midwifery (of which 118 WTE relat es to Staff Nurses and Midwives), 0.7% in Management & Administrative (of which 33 WTE relates to Clerical Grades III and IV), 0.6% in Medical & Dental, 0.4% in Health & Social Care Professionals and 0.3% in General Support. With the exception of Ireland E ast, all Hospital Groups are showing growth this month. Saolta HG shows the largest increase (+95 WTE), followed by UL & RCSI Hospital Groups. COVID related absences have continued to improve in March. Headcount of staff within Acute Operations on C OVID related absence stood at 1,270 the week ending 2nd March 2021, this number had reduced to 1,018 entering the last week of March; this compares to 1,569 entering the last week of February and 3,822 at the end of January. C OVID related absences capture staff on Special Leave with Pay, Cocooning and on leave due to caring arrangements. The majority of staff on absence are in the special leave with pay category, with Patient & Client Care the staff category with the highest level throughout the month, followe d by Nursing & Midwifery.

The number of people who held medical card eligibility on 31st March 2021 was 1,581,294, an increase of 1,705 on the previous month. The total number of persons with eligibility for a GP visit card on 31st March 2021 was 532,813, an increase of 1,692 on the previous month. As at 31st March 2021, 2,114,107 or 42.5% of the population had medical card or GP visit card eligibility, an overall increase of 3,397 on the previous month. (Population figures are based on the CSO 2020 estimated figure of 4,977,400). There was an upward movement in eligibility figures for March, with less cards removed in the 16- 44 year age group compared to the last two months. Environmental Health Food business establishments are routinely inspected to assess compliance with Official Food Control requirements. A total of 2,054 Planned and Planned Surveillance Inspections were carr ied out by the end of Q1. This represents a 75.1% shortfall at the end of Q1 target. While the EHS is operating business as usual targets have been impacted by business closures (particularly of the hospitality sector) during Level 5 restrictions. Additi onal impact on targets owing to support of HSA COVID19 Return To Work Safely protocol assessments and temporary reassignment of some resource to supporting Public Health in complex contact tracing and surveillance. Notwithstanding this, of those Planned and Planned Surveillance inspections that were carried out, 18% had either an unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory significant, unsatisfactory serious outcome. (Target <25% unsatisfactory). Under the Planning and Development Acts, Planning Authorities are required to consult with the HSE for developments accompanied by an environmental impact statement. For these types of developments the HSE can make submissions that inform the planning process with regard to the protection of public health and the maximising of health gain from these developments. As this work could be completed remotely, 100% of relevant consultation requests from planning authorities received a response from the Environmental Health Service by the end of Q1. Complexity of responses and the t iming of requests from planning authorities can influence the completion of consultations. Target is 95%. Complaints are received from members of the public regarding matters that a complainant considers to be a risk to public health for example an unsaf e foodstuff, an unhygienic food premises, tobacco being sold to minors, pests not being controlled and substandard cosmetic products. Responding to such complaints remained a key focus of EHS's contingency planning for responding to COVID -19. Thus 97.5% of all complaints received by the EHS by the end of Q1 were risk assessed within 1 working day. (Target is 95%). Complaints must be risk assessed to determine what course of action (if any) should be taken within one working day of receipt of the complaint . Responding to complaints remains a key priority. The Environmental Health Service carries out monthly sampling under Regulation 9 of the Fluoridation of Water Supplies Regulations 2007 to ensure compliance with the statutory range of concentration of fl uoride in fluoridated public drinking water supplies. By the end of Q1, 571 drinking water samples were taken to assess compliance which is a 7.2% shortfall of the target. Non achievement of the target was likely to be part influenced by plants being offl ine and not fluoridating which is outside of the control of the HSE 3 Inspections of E Cigarette Manufactures, Importers, Distributers and Retailers under E.U. (Manufacturer, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco and related Products) Regulations were completed which is a 70% shortfall at end of Q1. Targets impacted by business closures during Level 5 restrictions Inspections, Test Purchases and Mystery Shopping activities to assess compliance with the Sunbeds Act could not be completed in Q1 as these premises remain closed under Level 5 restrictions. Test purchases of cigarettes activity in this area is deferred until Q3 & Q4 - To remain under review in line with Government advice on restrictions Performance Profile January -March 2021 75 Emergency Management The HSE Emergency Management (EM) funct ion assists HSE leaders and managers at all levels across the health service to generate resilience by developing contingency around identified hazards and risks that threaten disruption to the provision of Health Services. EM fulfils the HSEs statutory obligations as a Local Competent Authority for Seveso sites nationally and is a prescribed body under the Planning Act for any licensed crowd events. HSE COVID 19 Response: HSE EM continues to support the HSE's response and management of COVID -19 both str ategically and operationally. The HSE National Crisis Management Team (NCMT) and the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) continues to meet weekly. Regionally, the EM teams continue to work as part of the Area Crisis Management Teams (ACMTs) and the Winter Action Teams (WAT) structures. Work continues with the Voluntary Emergency Services, the Civil Defence and the Defence Forces to coordinate external assistance to meet HSE requirements. EM supports the vaccination programme regionally and attends the Centralised Vaccination Clinic (CVC) working group, the CVC Area Leads Forum and the Regional Vaccination Steering groups. Regional Inter -agency Response: EM partakes in the Interagency Major Emergency Management (MEM) structures at the Regional S teering Groups (RSGs) and the Regional Working Groups (RWGs), which are meeting weekly/fortnightly. HSE EM continues to support s enior management teams in briefings and planning response arrangements. EM are actively linking with other statutory agencies t o coordinate the support required as part of the response, and are currently working with inter -agency partners on the planning effort for the establishment of the thirty -eight Centralised Vaccination Clinics. EM regions continue to complete prioritised components of the regional interagency work plans, subject to the constraints imposed by COVID -19. SEVESO: HSE legislative requirements as a Local Competent Authority have been met to date. Seveso planning for 2021 is underway across the EM regions, with r evision of external emergency plans with some Seveso exercises complete and others being scheduled. HSE Severe Weather: HSE Severe Weather planning, preparedness, response and recovery continues across all EM regions. Nationally, EM led on vertical and horizontal coordination of HSE planning for anticipated weather events in accordance with HSE guidance.

The number of women aged 65+ who had a complete mammogram in the period March 2021 was 2,025 above the target of 2,000 by 25 (1.3%). The number of women who had a complete mammogram year to date (January -March 2021) was 8,979 above the target of 5,000 by 3,979 (79.6%). Uptake in Q4 2020 was 87.1% In Q4 2020 90.3% of women were offered an assessment appointment within 2 weeks of notification of an abnormal mammogram result. In the second half of 2020 87.2% of women were offered hospital admission for treatment within 3 weeks of diagnosis of breast cancer BreastCheck Screening has resumed from the 8th of March. There have been incidents of service users cancelling due to fears of COVID -19. Assessment clinics have resumed and all areas have reduced capacity due to COVID19 infection control and social distancing. BreastCheck are monitoring surgical access and surgeries are being prioritised by the host hospitals. Cervical Check The number of unique women who had one or screening tests in a primary care setting in the period March 2021 notified to report date was 45,707 which was above the target of 24,000 by 21,707 (90.4%). The number of unique women who had one or more screening tests in a primary care setting year to date (January -March 2021) was 86,011 which is above the target of 77,000 by 9,011 (11.7 %) The average turnaround time for screening results from laboratories was 1.31 weeks, within the target of 4 weeks. Program me coverage at the end of December 2020 was 77.1% The COVID -19 era involves a change in how we provide care, as social distancing has a huge knock on effect on how many patients can be seen within GP practices and in colposcopy units. In January 2021, the third COVID Wave and the numbers of community cases affected the general population, including healthcare staff. Hospital capacity was prioritised with some services being significantly scaled back and even stood down. CervicalCheck is aware that periodi cally some practices/clinics were unable to offer cervical screening appointments, or may be operating at reduced capacity though CervicalCheck is aware that availability of cervical screening appointments has improved significantly now. CervicalCheck cont inue to advise those seeking to book appointments that they may not be able to do so at that time and asked them to keep in contact with their GP or clinic. Access to consumables has improved and on week commencing March 28th, the laboratory at Coombe Wom en and Infants Hospital resumed processing cervical screening samples for the programme. COVID has had a knock on effect on laboratory resourcing (both personnel and consumables) and whilst this is affecting the number of samples that can be processed each week we have seen an improvement over the last month. Cervical screening participation and laboratory processing volumes continues to be monitored on a weekly basis. All colposcopy units are operational. BowelScreen The number of men and women who have completed a satisfactory BowelScreen FIT test in the period (March 2021) was 7,458 which is below the target of 8,500 by 1,042 (12.3%). The number of men and women who have completed a satisfactory BowelScreen FIT test year to date (January-March 2021) was 19,950 which is below the target of 22,000 by 2,050 (9.3%). Performance Profile January -March 2021 82 Uptake in Q4 2020 was 38.2% Waiting times for a colonoscopy for those that have a FIT positive test was recorded and was within the 90% target at 91.9% within 20 working days in March. Eleven of the twelve contracted colonoscopy centres which were offering colonoscopies in March met the expected KPI of 90% within 20 days. COVID - 19 BowelScreen is closely monitoring colonoscopy capacity; invitations to participate are being issued based on avai lable capacity . Diabetic RetinaScreen The number of diabetics screened with a final grading result in the period March 2021 was 9,341 which is above the target of 8,850 by 491 clients (5.5%). The number of diabetics screened with a final grading resul t year to date (January - March 2021) was 25,557 which is above the target of 25,350 by 207 (0.8%). Uptake in Q4 2020 was 80% The programme continues to invite participants for screening. The current model for screening is inviting 50% of the backlog cohort and 50% of the prospective cohort. There is a good attendance at all screening clinics this is supported by an increased level of patient engagement. There are a number of barriers impacting on the number of invitations: the implementation of physica l distancing and infection control measures. The programme still has a number of challenges with patients referred to treatment clinics; currently treatment clinics are treating urgent and a very low number of routine cases - the programme continues to manage the increase in backlogs. Performance Profile January -March 2021 83 Finance Performance Profile January -March 2021 84 Introduction The National Service Plan (NSP) for the HSE was published on 24th February 2021 detailing how it will spend the \u20ac20.623b, including \u20ac1.68b on COVID -19 in 2021. The financial allocation represents an increase of \u20ac3.5b or 21% on last year's NSP. This includes an additional \u20ac1.68b for COVID -19 costs. The remaining \u20ac1.8b represents an underlying increase of 10.6% in health spending compared to last year, which is well ahead of the average annual increase of 7.3% received across the years 2016- 2020. A total of \u20ac1.1bn of this additional investment will deliver permanent and enduring improvements in healthcar e arising from the Sl\u00e1intecare reform programme. The 2021 budget has afforded us an opportunity to reduce the level of on- going financial risk that was present in some of our services pre- COVID -19, most notably within acute hospital services, disability s ervices and mental health services. It also gives us the means to provide improved services for people in Ireland and to progress important strategic reforms. This year we are working to strengthen our general operational capacity in our community an d hospital services, focusing on quality and patient safety, patient and service user involvement, data and analytics, risk management, financial management, safeguarding, eHealth, and procurement compliance. The HSE is fully supportive of the need to make significant changes to the current models of health and social care and is committed to working with the Sl\u00e1intecare Programme and the Department of Health to deliver this change, by addressing waiting times, shifting care from hospital to community, and improving financial controls, whilst also operating within a COVID -19 environment for the foreseeable future. COVID -19 has and continues to challenge the overall capacity and capability of the health service in a way that we have not experienced in living memory. The COVID -19 pandemic has led to unprecedented interruption to normal healthcare activity, with both community and acute settings affected. Not only have existing services been significantly impacted, but new services have had to be rapidly devel oped and deployed. Financial Performance Table 1 - Net Expenditure by Division - YTD March 2021 March 2021 3,692.9 143.4 3.9% 117.6 5.9 149.4 3.1% 169.2 (19.8) Detailed analysis of the divisional performances is provided in the relevant sections below. Performance Profile January -March 2021 85 The HSE's financial position at the end of March 2021 shows a YTD deficit of \u20ac149.4m , with a significant element of this being driven by the direct impacts of the 3rd COVID - 19 surge. Within this \u20ac149.4m deficit, acute operations have a YTD deficit of \u20ac184.1m , community services a deficit of \u20ac15.3m , pensions and demand led services a deficit of \u20ac5.9m and other operations are showing a surplus of ( \u20ac56.0m ) (mainly COVID -19 icit of \u20ac149.4m, \u20ac169.2m has been categorised by service areas as directly attributable to COVID -19 expenditure and (\u20ac19.8m) surplus as at tributable to core expenditure. The COVID -19 deficit to the end of March of \u20ac169.2m, \u20ac122.1m is in acute operations, \u20ac38.0m in community services, \u20ac51.6m (of which PCRS is \u20ac46.4m) in Pensions & Demand Led Areas with offsetting surpluses in other operations/services of (\u20ac42.5m). The COVID -19 related surplus of (\u20ac42.5m) in other operational services is primarily in relat ion to held funding not yet distributed to services in in relation to three specific expenditure items: Testing & Tracing Programme, COVID -19 supports and COVID -19 Vaccinations. Costs in relation to these three expenditure items have been incurred in other services across the HSE and will be matched with the centrally held funding in due course. Included in the (\u20ac42.5m), there is a surplus of (\u20ac36.0m) in the Testing & Tracing Programme and a surplus in health and wellbeing of (\u20ac6.2m) relating to COVID -19 Va ccinations.

These services are prov ided in response to population need and are consistent with wider health policies and objectives, including those of Sl\u00e1intecare. Hospitals continually work to improve access to healthcare, whilst ensuring quality and patient safety initiatives are priorit ised within allocated budgets, including the management of COVID -19 and other infections. Acute Hospital Care Acute operations has year -to-date expenditure of \u20ac1,712.0 against a year -to-date budget of \u20ac1,527.8 leading to a YTD deficit of \u20ac184.1m or 12.1% , which includes a deficit of \u20ac136.5m on acute hospital care, a deficit of \u20ac0.9m on the national ambulance service and a deficit of \u20ac46. 7m in private hospitals. Of the YTD deficit of \u20ac184.1m, \u20ac122.1m deficit has been categorised as directly attributable to COVID -19 expenditure and \u20ac62.05m deficit as attributable to core expenditure. The YTD deficit of \u20ac136.5m in acute hospital care consis ts of deficits of \u20ac42.8m in pay, \u20ac49.8m in non- pay a nd an income deficit of \u20ac43.9m. The \u20ac42.8m pay deficit is due to the recruitment of 1,382 additional wte's for YTD March (March monthly only 313 wte's) and also the backfilling of absent staff by agency/locum. This extra recruitment has occurred mainly as a result of Covid- 19. The \u20ac49.8m non-pay deficit mainly relates to deficits in: medical and surgical supplies of \u20ac7.0m, drugs and medicine of \u20ac5.7m, maintenance of \u20ac7.4m, cleaning & washing of \u20ac6.7m, bad and doubtful debts of \u20ac9.0m, professional services of \u20ac5.4m and other medical equipment of \u20ac3.6m. The \u20ac43.9m Y TD deficit on income is mainly attributable to maintenance charges of \u20ac54.1m owing to the reduction in hospital activity due to the third surge of Covid -19. Private Hospitals In January 2021, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with the private hospitals, referred to as Safety Net 2 (SN2), was finalised and signed by 18 private hospitals. This SLA is activated by 'surge events', and is predominantly utilised for the provision of unscheduled, urgent and time critical care to core activity patients. When a 'sur ge event' is triggered, a commencement notice is issued to the private hospitals - the first commencement notices were issued to the private hospitals on 22nd January 2021. The first surge event was due to end in mid- May 2021 following the issue of cessat ion notices. However, due to the cyber -attack, a separate Safety Net 3 (SN3) arrangement was negotiated. SN3 is the essentially the same model as SN2 except that there is no 'retainer' provision for guaranteed capacity. Under SN2, in order to guarantee c apacity, HSE pays a retainer for beds - i.e. if beds aren't used, the private hospital is paid by the HSE for the unused beds. This clause is not applicable to SN3. Expenditure on SN2 amounts to \u20ac61.7m for YTD March. This is an estimated cost. There are currently no funding streams / budget for SN2 or SN3.

Services are provided by GPs, public health nurses and Health Social Care Professions (HSCPs) through primary car e teams and Community Healthcare Networks (CHNs). Community services are currently delivered across ni ne Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs). Community Services has year -to-date expenditure of \u20ac1,660m against a year -to-date budget of \u20ac1,644m leading to a YTD deficit of \u20ac15.3m or 0.9% Of the YTD deficit of \u20ac15.3m, \u20ac38.0mm deficit has been categorised as directly attributable to COVID -19 expenditure and an offsetting surplus of (\u20ac22.7m) at tributable to core expenditure. Primary Care Services Primary care centres support the strategic shift of care and services to primary care, ensuring better access to care, offeri ng individuals and families a one stop shop to a broad range of primary care services in the community. The opening of multiple primary cares centres over recent years have p laced additional pressure on the primary care operational cost base, however these facilities form a key part of t he infrastructure required to provide primary care services to an aging demographic and underpin the overall shift to primary care. These centres proved to be an integral part of the health services response to the pandemic, i ncluding their utilisation as COVID -19 assessment hubs, swabbing sites and as vaccination centres. Performance Profile January -March 2021 88 A YTD deficit \u20ac12.0m of which \u20ac15.4m deficit has been categorised as directly attributable to Covid- 19 expenditure and (\u20ac3.3m) surplus as at tributable to core expenditure. Deficit of \u20ac15.4m in COVID -19 arose due to increased activity and expenditure due to the third surge of COVID -19, and mainly relates to o Pay of \u20ac5.4m, o Professional services of \u20ac3.7m o Maintenance of \u20ac2.4m o Capitation payments of \u20ac2.4m Surplus of (\u20ac3.3m) in core due to p lanned services not occurring as a result of the third surge of COVID -19, and mainly relates to o Paediatr ic homecare packages of (\u20ac2.8m) o Travel of (\u20ac1.3m) due to travel restrictions o Vacant positions of (\u20ac1.3m) due to delayed recruitment o Property costs of \u20ac3.0m and o Medical & surgical supplies of \u20ac1.8m Paediatric Home Care Packages - March YTD Costs of \u20ac7.2m have been incurred. Funding for this service was centralised in 2019 and \u20ac41m is held centrally, whi ch is allocated to each area to cover expenditure throughout the year. There has been a significant fall from planned number of cases being supported due to the COVID -19 pandemic. There are 526 cases in place YTD March, which represents an increase of 13 in t he year. Mental Health Services Specialist mental health services are provided in local community areas. These services include acute inpatient services, day hospitals, o utpatient clinics, community -based mental health teams (CAMHs, general adult and psychiatry of later life services), mental health of intellectual disability, community residential and continuing care residential services. Sub- specialties include rehabilitation and recovery, eating disorders, liaison psychiatry and perinatal mental health. A National Forensic Mental Health Service is also provided, including inpatient and in- reach prison services with a new modern and fit for purpose facility, increasing capacity to 130 beds. As a result of COVID -19, in line with public health advice on the provision of safe services, some community m ental health services were reduced. There was extensive use of remote consultation tools such as Attend Anywhere to ensure continuity of services for mental health patients. Also, a num ber of non- essential day & other services reduced their capacity at the start of the COVID -19 pandemic, with some staff redeployed into Mental Health acute units to cover sick leave which allowed for the covering of essential rostered hours across these acute units. Mental Health have a number of financial challenges, namel y a high level of agency & overtime due to reduced ability to recruit staff into available posts, and an increasing level of high cost residential placements with external private providers. The level of expenditure on external high cost residential placem ents is growing year on year due to the increasing complexity of patients and capacity constraints within the public system. Performance Profile January -March 2021 89 A YTD deficit of \u20ac5.4m of which \u20ac6.0m deficit has been categorised as directly attributable to COVID -19 expenditure and (\u20ac0.6m) s urplus as at tributable to core expenditure. Deficit of \u20ac6.0m in COVID -19 due to increased activity which is mainly driven by: o Payroll costs of \u20ac0.8m - Due to additional hours / increased part time hours / TOIL in Nursing/Medical/Support staff grades. o Agen cy costs of \u20ac1.7m - Predominately relate to Nursing/Medical/Support agency requirements to fill gaps in rosters in acute units due to increased activity and sick leave. o Capitation payments deficit of \u20ac1.1m - Increased private placements required to free up bed capacity in residential units to cater for increased activity and to help with social distancing requirements. o Cleaning & Washing deficit of \u20ac0.5m - Increased cleaning costs due to deep cleaning requirements in MH residential units and the purchase of cleaning equipment. o Maintenance deficit of \u20ac0.4m - Acute unit reconfiguration, setting up and fitting out of isolation pods. Building works to facilitate social distancing and isolation of patients. Surplus of (\u20ac0.6m) due to core services not occurring as a result of the third surge of C OVID -19, and mainly relates to: o Payroll deficit of \u20ac0.5m o Travel surplus of (\u20ac1.5m) due to travel restrictions o Educatio n & training surplus of (\u20ac0.6m) o Professional services surplus of (\u20ac0.7m) o Light & heat surplus of (\u20ac0. 4m) o Rent rates surplus of (\u20ac0.5m). Surpluses which will balance as the year progresses and services are restored to pre- COVID -19 levels. COVID -19 expenditure is continuing at an average expenditure rate of circa \u20ac2.0m per month. Older Persons Services Older persons services provide a wide range of services including home supports, community supports, intermediate care (both residential and in the home), as well as short stay and long stay care when remaining at home is no longer feasible (Nursing Homes Support Scheme, NHSS). This ensures that appropriate care pathways are in place so services can be delivered at adequate levels, in an integrated manner to meet the needs of older people. Older Persons services (including NHSS) A YTD surplus of (13.3m) of which (\u20ac1.8m) surplus is in Older Persons Services and (\u20ac11.6m) is in NHSS. The overall YTD surplus of (\u20ac13.3m) is split across the main cost categories as follows: o (\u20ac21.9m) surplus in Home Support - which were susp ended due to COVID -19 shielding o \u20ac12.4m deficit in Residential Care - due to reduced bed numbers and actual cost of care in excess of paid rate. Units are operating at below 95% capacity; March occupancy is 87%, resulting in reduced NHSS income. Performance Profile January -March 2021 90 o (\u20ac3.1m) surplus in Other - mainly arising in transitional care beds, complex cases and intensive homecare packages. These surpluses are expected to reduce as activity increases through 2021, and as budget profiles are amended. Of the YTD surplus of (\u20ac1.8m) in Older Persons Services, \u20ac11.0m deficit has be en categorised as directly attributable to COVID -19 expenditure and (\u20ac12.7m) surplus as at tributable to core expenditure. Deficit of \u20ac11.0m in COVID -19 due to increased activity which is mainly driven by o Payroll costs of \u20ac9.4m of which agency costs is \u20ac6.2m o Cleaning and washing of \u20ac1.6m Surplus of (\u20ac12.7m) due to services not occurring as a result of the third surge of COVID -19, and mainly relates to o Home support surplus of (\u20ac9.2m), which were suspended due to COVID -19 shielding o Transitional care beds surplus of (\u20ac2.3m). NHSS (included in Older Persons above) Of the YTD of surplus (\u20ac11.6m) in NHSS, (\u20ac2.7m) surplus has been categorised as directly attributable to COVID -19 expenditure and (\u20ac8.9m) surplus as at tributable to core expenditure. Surplus of (\u20ac2.7m) in COVID -19 due to budget profiling and is currently under review. Surplus of (\u20ac8.9m) in core is due to patients not availing of the NHSS scheme which are currently 913 below the levels set in the NSP due to COVID -19, 679 starters below NSP levels and 234 leavers above NSP levels. Disability services Disability services are provided to those with physical, sensory, intellectual disability and autism in day, respite and resi dential settings. Services include personal assistants, home support, multi -disciplinary and other community supports. The costs in Disability Services are primarily driven by the clients need and the complexity of each individual case presenting. As a result of COVID -19, and to fully align with Public Health guidance as recommended via the NPHET, the HSE and its partner service providers put in place a range of measures, which included the prioritisation of vital residential (including new emergency residential placements) and Home Support/Personal Assistance services whilst curtailing or closing certain services such as day services, respite services, and certain clinical supports. Staff and resources associated with closed or curtailed services were redeployed where possible to support residential provision and to provide for tar geted in- home, community and tele- /online supports for service users and families based on prioritised needs. A YTD deficit of \u20ac10.0m of which \u20ac6.9m deficit has been categorised as directly attributable to COVID -19 expenditure and \u20ac3.1m deficit as at tribut able to core expenditure. Deficit of \u20ac6.9m in COVID -19 due to increased activity which is mainly driven by o Pay deficit of \u20ac3.0m and o Grants to outside agencies of \u20ac2.1m. Deficit of \u20ac3.1m in core expenditure due to o Capitation payments deficit of \u20ac4.8m - due to increased capitation payments to support challenged s.39 organisations o Pay surplus of (\u20ac2.2m) due to vacant posts. Performance Profile January -March 2021 91 10 new emergency residential placements were put in place in March 2021 (including 5 COVID -19 related places), with a YTD total of 23 ne w places (including 7 COVID - 19 related places). YTD expenditure on 23 new emergency residential placements of approximately \u20ac1.2m, with an estimated 2021 full year cost of \u20ac7.0m YTD spend on Emergency residential placements amounts to 10 places in March 2021 (including 5 COVID -19 related places).

NDTP has three key domains under its remit: medical education and training, medical workforce planning, and the consultant approval process. The combi ned objective of the three core functions of NDTP is to ensure that the Irish health service is provided with the appropriate number of specialists, who possess the required skills and competencies to deliver high quality and safe care. The NCCP manages, organises and delivers cancer control on a whole population basis. Its aims are to reduce cancer incidence; treat cancer, to reduce cancer mortality and morbidity; and to improve the quality of life of people living with cancer. The NCCP oversees cancer prevention and early diagnosis, rapid access services, treatment of cancer including surgery, radiotherapy and systemic therapy. It has also commenced survivorship, psycho- oncology, and child, adolescent and young adult services, and enhanced community oncology support. As a result of COVID -19, cancer services prioritised activity across the patient pathway in line with national clini cal guidance. This ensures emergency, time critical and symptomatic services for cancer (diagnostics, surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy) are delivered appropriately and that patients contin ued to be seen in a timely way. National doctors training & planning (NDTP) has a YTD surplus of ( \u20ac1.7m) consisting of a surplus of (\u20ac1.7m) in core related expenditure primarily in education and training.

These programmes aim to reduce morbidity and mortali ty in the population through early detection and treatment across the programmes. A YTD breakeven position. Within this breakeven position, there is a surplus of ( \u20ac0.3m) in pay and a deficit of \u20ac0.3m in non- pay. The pay surplus of (\u20ac0.3m) is arising due to medical staff vacancies. The non- pay deficit of \u20ac0.3m relates to programmes that have restarted and are eliminating their backlog, mainly in cervical scr eening and breast check.

The services within H&W support people and communities to protect and improve their health and wellbeing; turning research, evidence and knowledge into action; acting as the authority on health, wellbeing and policy development; building an intelligent health system and a healthier population. Our public health teams play a major role in responding to the COVID -19 pandemic. Public health t eams work closely with the wider health system to mitigate and limit the spread of the virus using evidence- based strategies, guidance, disease surveillance and health intelligence developed nationally. Public health also support end- to-end COVID -19 testing and contact tracing designed and delivered to specifically protect the health of people living in Ireland. A YTD surplus of (\u20ac10.6m) of which (\u20ac6.2m) surplus has been categorised as directly attributable to COVID -19 expenditure and (\u20ac4.3m) surplus as at tributable to core expenditure. Surplus of (\u20ac6.2m) in COVID -19 which is mainly due to timing of budget distribution relating to the COVID -19 vaccine programme. Surplus of (\u20ac4.3m) in core expenditure, mainly due to the temporary suspension of the schools programmes. These programmes have resumed now that the schools have reopened.

Its primary role is as a regulatory inspectorate responsible for a broad range of statutory functions enacted to protect and promote the health of the population, takes preventative actions and enforces legislation in areas such as food safety, tobacco control, sunbed regulation, alcohol control and fluoridation of public water supplies. Notwithstanding the impact of COVID -19, a key focus for the service is to ensure the provision of our statutory obligations in relation to environmental health. The EHS i s playing a key role to protect the health of the population in the context of COVID -19, in addition to augmenting its core service to respond to anticipated Brexit demands. The YTD deficit of \u20ac0.1m in EHS primarily relates to a pay surplus of (\u20ac0.4m) arising due to staff vacancies along with an income deficit of \u20ac0.4m which relates to a historic income target. Prior to Irish Water being in existence, EHS provided services to county councils and charged for sam e. Since the creation of I rish Water, the councils provide this service hence the loss of income to EHS. Emergency management (EM) assists leadership and management across all levels of the HSE in the preparation of major emergency plans and the identification and mitigation of st rategic and operational risk to the organisation. It also engages with other agencies, government departments and external bo dies in order to ensure a health input to co- ordinated national resilience. The EU and North South Unit works on behalf of the HS E to promote health co- operation with providers on both a north south and east west basis to ensure better health outcomes. The unit co- ordinates with others to ensure the delivery of a wide range of services including emergency care, travelling from one j urisdiction to another to access services, the provision of direct services and co -operation on new initiatives. The EU and North South Unit support services to identify and fund appropriate projects. This is in conjunction with the cross -border health and social care partnership, Co- operation and Working Together (CAWT). Brexit and COVID -19 pose new challenges in relation to healthcare delivery and co- operation. In this context all efforts have been made to ensure the continuation of all cross -border servi ces, to the greatest extent possible. Performance Profile January -March 2021 95 Testing and Tracing As part of the HSE response to controlling and suppressing the transmission of the disease, a sustainable and flexible National Testing and Tracing Operating Model for COVID -19 was developed. T he National Testing and Tracing service pathway comprises referrals for testing, swabbing, laboratory testing, result communi cation and contact tracing (including surveillance and outbreak management), and is capable of delivering and responding to the challenges of service requirements and demands. YTD surplus of (\u20ac36.0m). This surplus is primarily due to timing of budget distribution relating to the COVID -19 Testing & Tracing programme, and is only a timing issue rather than an actual saving. The Testing programme is also supported by acute & community services with an additional expenditure being incurred in service setting such as testing centres and hospital laboratory testing.

Demand Led Scheme Table 9 - Demand Led Services Areas March YTD March 2021 Pensions & Demand Led Services Approved Budget 271.9 73.2 67.4 5.8 8.6% 5.2 0.6 Treatment Abroad and Cross Border Directive 28.6 11.0 7.1 3.8 53.5% - 3.8 EHIC (European Health Insurance Card) 10.5 0.9 2.6 (1.8) -67.5% - (1.8) Pensions & Demand Led Services Total 4,582.3 1,133.8 1,127.8 5.9 0.5% 51.6 (45.7) Expenditure in demand led areas such as Pensions, State Claims Agency, Primary Care Reimbursement Service and Treatment Abroad and Cross Border Directive is driven primarily by eligibility, legislation , policy, demographic and economic factors. Accordingly, it is not amenable to normal management controls in terms of seeking to limit costs to a specific budget limit given the statutory and policy basis for the various schemes. In some cases, it can also be difficult to predict with accuracy in any given year and can vary from plan depending on a number of factors outside of the health services direct control. Pensions Pensions provided within the HSE and HSE -funded agencies (section 38) cannot readily be controlled in terms of financial performance and can be difficult to predict across the workforce given the lack of fully integrated systems and the variables involved in individual staff members' decisions as to when to retire. The HSE will continue t o comply with the strict public sector wide requirement to ring- fence public pension related funding and costs and keep them separate from mainstream service costs. Pension costs and income are monitored caref ully and reported on regularly. As part of NS P2021 an additional \u20ac20.0m has been assigned to pensions. Performance Profile January -March 2021 97 YTD deficit of \u20ac2.6m is comprised of a surplus in Additional Superannuation Contribution (ASC) of (\u20ac2.5m) and a deficit in pensions of \u20ac5.1m. This should not be extrapolated to determ ine a possible year end result. Pension expenditure is volatile in nature but generally in an upward direction as we approach the end of the year. Transition to the Single Public Service Pension Scheme (SPSPS) retirements will see a reduction in the cost of pensions but this will occur gradually over a number of years. State Claims Agency (SCA) The SCA is a separate legal entity which manages and settles claims on behalf of government departments and public bodies, including the HSE. The HSE reimburses the SCA for costs arising from claims under the clinical and general indemnity schemes and had an allocated 2021 budget for this reimbursement of \u20ac410m. There is a significant focus within the HSE on the mitigation of clinical risks within services including those services where adverse clinical incidents have very significant impacts on patients and their families and lead to su bstantial claims settled by the SCA and reimbursed by the HSE. It is noted that the most substantial drivers of the growth in costs reimbursed to the SCA over recent years have been factors related to the operation of the legal process around claims and the overall maturing of the claims portfolio, rather than by the incidence of claims. Precise cost prediction in this area has prov en to be extremely challenging. YTD surplus of (\u20ac15.1m), which is mainly due to a delay in the number of cases processed by the courts se rvices as a result of COVID -19. Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) The PCRS supports the delivery of a wide range of primary care services to the general public through primary care contractors like general practitioners (GPs), dentists, pharmacists and optometrists / ophthalmologists for the free services or reduced cost services they provide to the public across a range of community health schemes or arrangements. These schemes or arrangements form the infrastructure through which the Irish health system funds a significant proportion of primary care to the public. PCRS also makes payments to suppliers and manufacturers of high tech drugs and f acilitates direct payment to hospitals involved in the provision of national treatment programmes such as the NCCP and the National Hepatitis C Treatment Programme. PCRS manages the National Medical Card Unit which processes all medical card and GP visit c ard applications at a national level. It also processes drugs payment scheme (DPS) and long- term illness (LTI) applications. The schemes are operated by PCRS on the basis of legislation and/or government policy and direction provided by the DoH. In response to the Covid- 19 pandemic, a number of measures were undertaken by the HSE which have an impact on the various schemes/arrangements operated by the PCRS. Where a decision has a definitive cost attributable to the pandemic, the cost will be reported separate to the business as usual costs. YTD deficit of \u20ac10.6m, of which \u20ac46.4m deficit has been categorised as directly attributable to COVID -19 expenditure and (\u20ac35.8m) surplus as at tributable to core expenditure. Deficit of \u20ac46.4m in COVID -19, mainly due to GP fees and allowances of \u20ac38.8m, G MS pharmacy drugs of \u20ac4.5m and GMS Pharmacy Fees of \u20ac2.5m. The impact of this amount has been counteracted by reduction in other service s resulting from the emergency. Surplus of (\u20ac35.8m) in core expenditure, mainly due to surpluses in GP fees and allowances of (\u20ac16.3m), GMS pharmacy of (\u20ac5.7m), NDMS oncology drugs/medicines term (\u20ac3.7m), NDMS Hep C programme of (\u20ac3.5m), drug payment scheme of (\u20ac1.2m). These surpluses are offset by a deficit of \u20ac1.4m in NDMS bespoke fundi ng decisions. High Tech drug spend is increasing each year, due to 2020 new drugs in addition to full year effect of 2019 and 2018 newly approved drugs. In addition year on year number of patients dispensed to continues to rise across most condition types and for all drug types. The demand is primarily across the following conditions: cancer, cystic fibrosis and rheumatology. PCRS continues to face significant financial challenges and increased demand for services. Financial and related general performance within PCRS is reviewed on a monthly basis with officials from DoH and DPER. Performance Profile January -March 2021 98 Demand Led Local Schemes The costs within these schemes are largely demand- led, including drug costs in relation to HIV and statutory allowances such as blind welfare allowance, and are therefore not amenable to normal budgetary control measures. YTD deficit of \u20ac5.8m, of which \u20ac0.6m has been categorised as being directly attributable to COVID -19 expenditure and \u20ac5.2m attributable to core service expenditure. Treatment Abroad Scheme and Cross Border Healthcare (TAS/CBD) The treatment abroad scheme provides for the referral of patients to another EU/EEA country or Switzerland for a treatment that is not available in Ireland. The cross border directive entitles persons ordinarily resident in Ireland who have an appropriate referral for public healthcare to opt to avail of that healthcare in another EU/EEA country or Switzerland. These schemes relate to the provision of clinically urgent care and treatment abroad. As with other demand- led services it is difficult to predict with accuracy the expenditure and activity patterns of these schemes, particularly in a COVID -19 environment. TAS is specific to very specialised treatments. As a result of Covid- 19, public hospitals were not seeing patients except in emergencies; therefore, TAS patients were not accessing their primary consultants and were not being referred abroad. However, these patients will still require these treatments and this should be regarded as a delay in referrals, which will increase again as Covid -19 restrictions are lifted. Access to the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) for patients post the UK exit from the EU (Brexit) remains unchanged. The provisions of EU Regulation 883/2004 were mirrored in the Trade & Co- Operation Agreement concluded by the UK and the EU on 24th Dec 2020. The TAS expects access to healthcare under the scheme to continue as usual during 2021 with the exception of Covid- 19 restrictions which may impact. To date these restricts have not had any discernible impact on referral or access to treatments under the Scheme. CBD has also seen a significant drop in activity due to COVID -19. From March 2020, the private hospitals abroad were not available for private healthcare; therefore, CBD patients could not acces s their main service providers. YTD deficit of \u20ac3.8m, as the budget was reduced by \u20ac29.2m in 2021. European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) The EHIC is used for instances where you are travell ing to another EU State. If you fall ill or injured during such a trip your EHIC will cover any necessary care you might need. Again, due to the demand led nature of these schemes it is difficult to predict expenditure accurately. The E125 scheme is for European citizens who are on short term visits to another member state. It is anticipated that the E125 scheme will be in a surplus position at year end with COVID -19 impacting travel within the EU. The E127 scheme is availed of by European citizens who reside on a long term basis in another member state. E125's and E127's received in from participating member states in March were significantly lower than budgeted numbers. As a demand led cost this is open to significant variances month on month. As a resu lt of COVID -19, less international travel has taken place than was initially anticipated which is resulting in surpluses in the EHIC scheme. YTD surplus of (\u20ac1.8m). Conclusion The HSE is an organisation undergoing significant change as well as facing a significant challenge in terms of its response to the current COVID -19 pandemic. There are long- standing challenges in our services, some of which have been further impacted due to COVID -19. The HSE is fully supportive of the need to make significant changes to the current models of health and social care and is committed to working with the Sl\u00e1intecare Programme and the Department of Health to d eliver this change, by addressing waiting times, shifting care from hospital to community, and improving financial controls, whilst also operating within a COVID -19 environm ent for the foreseeable future. Performance Profile January -March 2021 99 The Corporate Plan was developed in 2020, setting out the key actions the HSE will take over the next three years to improve our health service and the health and wellbeing of people living in Ireland. The vision is for a healthier Ireland, with the right care, at the right time and in the right place. T he approach taken is to prioritise a small number of large service transformations, which allow us to focus our efforts and resources to make demonstrable improvements to health service performance and delivery over the next three years. These transformati ons are consistent with Sl\u00e1intecare, our 10- year vision to transform Ireland's health and social care services. In addition to these transformations, we will continue to make progress in many other key areas of service delivery, such as women's health and maternity care, which require our focus and commitment to improvement and are important to our patients and service users. We will also seek to accelerate the digitisation of our health service to improve access, support process improvements, and drive value for money. With the availability now of effective vaccines, we must continue to be mindful of, and to mitigate, the risk that COVID -19 poses to 'normal' healthcare activities. The on-going COVID -19 pandemic will continue to bring uncertainty and complexity to the planning and delivery of services in 2021. The very significant budget allocation for the health service in 2021 underlines the strong strategic alignment that now exists between the HSE, the Minister for Health and his Department. The budget has afforded us an opportunity to reduce the level of on- going financial risk that was present in some of our services pre- COVID -19, most notably within acute hospital services, disability services and mental health services. It also gives us the means to provide improved services for people in Ireland and to progress important strategic reforms.

Details for each year since absence reporting commenced are shown below, demonstrating the impact of COVID -19 related absence in 2021. Performance Profile January -March 2021 112 When compared with previous years, and in particular 2020, the 2021 Year to Date figure appears considerably higher. However, this as noted above, is impacted by COVID -19 related absence, accounting for 3.6% of all absence in 2021. On a like f or like basis, excluding COVID -19 absence impact, the comparison is 4.3% in 2021 compared to 4.5% in 2020. Therefore, excluding COVID -19 related absence, the Year to Date absence in 2021 is lower than that reported in 2020. It puts the Health Services generally in line with the rates reported by ISME for large organisations in the private sector and available information for other large public sector organisations both in Ireland and internationally (excluding COVID -19). Nonetheless, it is important to not e that Health Sector absence is not directly comparable to other sectors as the nature of the work, employee demographics and diversity of the organisation needs to be recognised. H ealth sector work can be physically and psychologically demanding, increasi ng the risk of work related illness and injury. However, these trends are generally in- line with international public healthcare organisations. Health service absence rates are detailed in the attached report. Notes: Absence Rate is the term generally used to refer to unscheduled employee absences from the workplace. Absence rate is defined as an absence from work other than annual leave, public holidays, maternity leave and jury duty. The HSE's sets absence rates as a key result area (KRA) with the objec tive of reducing the impact & cost of absence and commits to a national target level Health Sector Absence Rates: March 2021 As per HR Circular 016/2021, the deadline for submission of the monthly national absence data has been modified, to bring for ward reporting to the 19th of every month for the previous month's absence. This new arrangement is effective for the March 2021 reporting period and therefore this month's data reflects the new reporting timelines. For this reason, as a first reporting cycle, the national absence figures for this month, may be impacted by the implementation of this deadline for submission of the dat a. The reported absence rate for March stands at 4.9%. This is a significant decrease on the previous month, reported at 6.4%, however, COVID -19 related absence accounted for 2.2% of last month's absence rate, compared to 1% this month. Nonetheless, this month's absence rate also continues to be impacted by COVID -19 related absence at 1.0%. Excluding COVID -19 absence, this months' absence rate is 3.9% which is significantly lower than that of last month, and for the same period last year, and therefore as noted above, may be impacted by the new reporting timeframe. These figures are reflected in the attached National Absence Report.
