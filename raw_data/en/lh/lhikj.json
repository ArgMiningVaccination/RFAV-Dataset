In the case of Brazil, for exam- ple, it is thanks to a series of promotional policies that the culture of Chinese medicine has developed a unique diffusion and influence in this country. Analysis of the Conditions Under which the Diffu - sion of TCM in Brazil Occurred According to Sun [1], \"the characteristics of the culture itself pro- vide the possible and necessary conditions for diffusion, and other social and natural factors facilitate promogation.\" The unique char - acteristics of Chinese medical culture itself, which are different from Western philosophical theoretical systems, provide sufficient neces-sary conditions for its worldwide promogation, while some social factors based on national conditions facilitate the promogation of Chinese medical culture in the specific country of Brazil. Characteristic Factors of the TCM Culture Traditional Chinese medicine is based on the philosophical prin- ciples of traditional Chinese culture, and pays attention to the inter - dependence, opposition and mutual transformation of human physi-ology, pathology and pathogenesis. It is very different from Western allopathic medicine. The overall concept of \"correspondence between human and nature\" is the philosophical basis of the theory of tradition - al Chinese medicine, that is, the concentrated expression of \"Chinese people pay attention to the collective, while Westerners pay attention to the individual\" in medicine culture. The classification of clinical diseases by the Chinese medicine culture conforms to the principle of general classification, rather than the Western classification principle of \"treat the head for headaches and treat the feet for foot pain\", which is irrelevant to the overall goal. Therefore, the two ways of thinking in China and the West are clearly different in the performance of medical concepts. When traditional Chinese medicine, as a cultural concept and treatment method with different understandings of the body, health and disease, spreads in countries around the world, it will inevita - bly cause a series of social repercussions. Governments also need to consider whether to adopt corresponding policies and measures for its incorporation into their national health care system. At the same time, in the process of disseminating and promoting TCM culture, it is inevitable to encounter a number of problems related to legislative oversight, professional training authorizations, and the formulation of medical service standards. The dissemination of Chinese medicine culture brings different personal habits, cultural customs and unique medical perceptions closer together and improves cross-cultural com- munication.Wang R, J Altern Complement Integr Med 2023, 9: 343 DOI: 10.24966/ACIM-7562/100343 HSOA Journal of Alternative, Complementary & Integrative Medicine Research Article Ruotong Wang* Tianjin Foreign Studies University, Tianjin, ChinaThe Cultural Communication of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Brazil Abstract Generally speaking, different societies and cultures have differ - ent perceptions of the causes of disease. It is common for people to interpret bodily constitution and respond to various clinical phe-nomena based on concepts, symbols and treatment protocols ac-cumulated and internalized by their social and cultural experiences. In that way, social representations of health and disease are linked to the perceptions of life and society of individuals in different cul- tures, which explains the positive response of Brazilian society to the new therapeutic concepts introduced by the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) culture. These social representations are dynamic and build and develop into trends over time. As globalization contin-ues to deepen the level of cultural exchange between countries, the promotion of TCM culture in Brazil has largely developed a relatively mature dissemination path over the decades. The purpose of this article is to make a few suggestions on the future direction of coop-eration between the two countries by sorting out the process of the dissemination of TCM culture in Brazil. Keywords: TCM cul- ture disseminationCitation: Wang R (2023) The Cultural Communication of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Brazil. J Altern Complement Integr Med 9: 343. Page 2 of 8 J Altern Complement Integr Med ISSN: 2470-7562, Open Access Journal DOI:10.24966/ACIM-7562/100343 Volume 9 Issue 3 100343Social factors in Brazil The social factor introduction of TCM culture in Brazil and its widespread dissemination can be broadly divided into three aspects: First, Brazil itself has a strong acceptance of TCM culture. Tra- ditional Brazilian medicine already has the means to seek healing effects through natural resources, i.e., using local medicinal plants to treat patients, which coincides with the diagnosis and treatment methods of traditional Chinese medicine decoctions and Chinese pat- ent medicines. Therefore, the dissemination of TCM culture in Brazil is not essentially the introduction of a completely different medical culture, which will cause a large-scale culture shock, but a cultural dissemination that can also find a sense of identity in the Brazilian national culture itself. Secondly, Brazilian society always has doubts and reflections about the Western medical system. Looking at the history of the dis- semination of TCM culture in Brazil, it is not difficult to find that the most important points of development are basically accompanied by a \"crisis of confidence\" in the Western medical system in Brazilian society. In the development of Brazilian medicine, seeking and intro- ducing a comprehensive and supplementary medical technology and a medical culture with more humanistic care is an inevitable choice when the Western medical system cannot solve all the practical prob-lems of the current medical and healthcare system. Finally, globalization is the key to the dissemination of TCM cul- ture, not only in Brazil, but throughout the world. As Chinese scholar Zhang Baijia has said, China's diplomatic process in recent decades is \"changing itself and influencing the world.\" While globalization has profoundly affected the economy and way of life of the Chinese peo- ple, it has also strengthened China's global national strength. China's influence in the world is constantly increasing, causing globalization to gradually bring in more elements of Chinese culture. Analysis of the Forms of Dissemination and Promo - tion of the TCM Culture in Brazil China and Brazil formally established diplomatic relations on Au- gust 15, 1974, established a strategic partnership in 1993, and up-graded the relationship between the two countries to a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2012. The earliest intergovernmental coopera - tion involving traditional Chinese medicine between China and Brazil dates back to the 1980s. The two countries signed a letter of intent on promoting scientific and technological exchanges and health coopera- tion between the two countries in Brasilia in 1983. An important turn- ing point occurred in 2009 when Brazil's Temporary Health Minister visited Beijing. Since then, medical and health cooperation between China and Pakistan and the promotion of TCM culture have begun to make significant progress. In 2011, the two countries signed the Joint Action Plan between the Government of the Federative Republic of Brazil and the Government of the People's Republic of China (2010-2014), which clarified how the two countries would cooperate in the field of medicine and health in the next four years, marking a new era for the promotion and exchange of Chinese medicine culture in Brazil. In recent years, the two countries have been engaged in nor - malizing the process of promoting and disseminating TCM culture in Brazil at the government level, and have formulated corresponding policies and regulations to improve the path of promotion and dissem- ination.Brazil - Incorporation of TCM Diagnosis and Treat - ment Methods into the National Medical and Health Care System Since the Federal Council of Physical Therapy and Occupation - al Therapy (COFFITO) certified acupuncture as a physical therapy profession in 1985, the promotion and development of TCM culture in Brazil has become increasingly standardized, and a series of rele - vant laws and regulations on the practice standards and curriculum system of the TCM industry have been issued. In 2006, the Brazilian Ministry of Health issued Ordinance No. 971/2006, which incorpo- rated traditional Chinese medicine into the Unified Health System (SUS), including acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, auricular point therapy, wind removal therapy, and Tai Chi. In 2017, Brazilian citizens seeking medical treatment under the SUS system used the above TCM treatments already reach a total of 1.4 million times and in 2018, Brazil incorporated another 10 TCM treatments into SUS. So far, there are totally 29 TCM treatments covered by the SUS system. Regarding the use of basic terminology in traditional Chinese med- icine, following the official publication of the International Standard of Basic Chinese Medicine Nomenclature into English in 2007, the Translation Department of the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies also released the International Standard of Basic Chinese Medicine Nomenclature into Portuguese. With the standardization of TCM terminology in Brazil and indeed in all Portuguese-speaking countries, the avenues for teaching and disseminating TCM clinical disciplines and research fields in Brazil have been improved, and the quality and efficiency of internal information exchange in the TCM industry has been enhanced, thus ensuring a smooth functioning of the propagation of TCM culture in Brazil. In addition, under the framework of BRICS countries, after the successful \"BRICS Health Ministers Meeting and High Level Meet- ing on Traditional Medicine\" in July 2017, on September 4 in the same year, the leaders of BRICS countries (Chinese President Xi, Brazilian then President Temer, Russian President Putin, South Af- rican then President Zuma, Indian Prime Minister Modi) jointly signed the Xiamen Declaration of BRICS Leaders in Xiamen, Fu-jian Province. The declaration states, \"We agree to strengthen the role of BRICS countries in global health governance, particularly in the World Health Organization and United Nations agencies, to in- crease access to innovative medical products through research and development, and to improve access to affordable, quality, effective and safe medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and other pharmaceutical products and technologies and medical services by promoting health systems and health financing and technologies and access to health - care services. We agree to improve surveillance capacity and medical services to address communicable diseases such as Ebola, AIDS, tu-berculosis, malaria, and other non-communicable diseases, and en- courage greater use of information and communication technologies to improve public health services. We welcome the positive outcome of the BRICS Health Ministers Meeting and High Level Meeting on Traditional Medicine and appreciate the establishment of a long-term mechanism for exchange and cooperation in traditional medicine to promote mutual learning and appreciation and transmission of tradi - tional medicine\". In November 2017, the World Hepatitis Summit, co-hosted by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the World Hepatitis Alliance (WHA) and the World Health Organization (WHO), was held in S\u00e3o Paulo, Citation: Wang R (2023) The Cultural Communication of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Brazil. J Altern Complement Integr Med 9: 343. Page 3 of 8 J Altern Complement Integr Med ISSN: 2470-7562, Open Access Journal DOI:10.24966/ACIM-7562/100343 Volume 9 Issue 3 100343Brazil. During the summit, the first meeting of the First China-Bra- zil HPC Health Sub-Committee was held, with the participation of Wang Guoqiang, then Vice Minister of Health of China, and Ricardo Barros, then Minister of Health of Brazil. During the meeting, the prospects for cooperation between the two countries in healthcare and other related areas, such as medical research, pharmaceutical R&D, and the dissemination of Chinese traditional medicine in Brazil, were discussed. With the establishment of the Health Sub-Committee of the China-Brazil High Commission, the two countries have reached a new level of cooperation in the promotion of Chinese medicine through the platform of this high-level forum and the corresponding plans to advance the agenda of practical cooperation activities. China - Focuses on Supporting Macao as an Import - ant Platform for the Promotion of the Culture of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Portuguese Speak - ing Countries Since Macau officially returned to the Chinese motherland on De- cember 20th 1999, it has always served as an important platform for cultural exchange between China and Portuguese-speaking countries. Consequently, various cultural fields, including traditional Chinese medicine, have gained more mutual exchanges and communication. This article mainly introduces Macao's two important platforms in promoting TCM culture - the Traditional Chinese Medicine Science and Industrial Park for Guangdong-Macao Cooperation and the WHO Traditional Medicine Cooperation Center (Macao). In April 2011, as the first landing project of the Guangdong-Ma- cao Cooperation Framework Agreement, the Science and Industrial Park of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Guangdong-Macao Coop-eration officially landed in Hengqin. On October 22, 2018, President Xi gave important instructions on the development of TCM and the construction of the park when he visited. President Xi stressed that, \"Chinese medicine is the treasure house of Chinese civilization, and it is necessary to deeply explore the treasure house of Chinese medi - cine, promoting the integration of production, education and research, the industrialization and modernization of TCM, and showing TCM to the whole world.\" The Park officially established the Internation - al Exchange and Cooperation Center in June 2015, taking Portu-guese-speaking countries as the entry point, to carry out international registration, import and export trade, professional training, etc. Com- bined with the international cultural promotion model \"using medi - cine to promote the drugs\", the Park will continue to expand TCM cooperation with different countries and regions around the Portu- guese-speaking countries. On August 18, 2015, the International Forum on Traditional Med- icine and the Establishment Ceremony of the World Health Organi- zation Traditional Medicine Cooperation Center (Macao) was held in Macau. The Center and the World Health Organization (WHO) are engaged in the training of TCM practitioners, cooperation on drug quality and safety, and joint promotion of the integration of TCM into the public health system in countries around the world. In addition, Dr. Wang Guoqiang, already the Deputy Director of the National Health and Family Planning Commission and Director of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, signed the Comple - mentary Cooperation Agreement in the area of Chinese Medicine with Dr. Alexis Tam, already the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture of the Macao SAR Government. The Agreement supports the MSAR and the Center to carry out their functions, and supports Macau to play its crucial role in conducting exchanges and cooperation in TCM with countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, especially the Portuguese-speaking countries. Operational Mechanisms for the Promotion and Ex - change of TCM Culture in Brazil According to Sun's [2] opinion, \"cultural transmission is a process in which a culture crosses the original cultural region to contact the culture of another social region indicating the completion of one part of the transmission process, and then it has to go through the links of conflict, evaluation, selection, adaptation, and integration. Only then will the process of diffusion be completed\". In the process of cultural diffusion, there is a possibility of cultural conflict, the latter being the contradiction and confrontation between cultures of different natures, i.e., the \"non-confrontation\" between local traditional culture and for - eign heterogeneous culture. Marilene Cabral do Nascimento, an asso-ciate professor at the Institute of Group Health of the Federal Univer - sity of Fluminense, Brazil, has compiled articles on acupuncture and moxibustion in the mainstream media in the states of Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo from 1974 to 1996, and has conducted a detailed study of the promotion of acupuncture and moxibustion culture in Brazil. In her book \"De Panac\u00e9ia Escrita\" (From panacea to medical profession: acupuncture in the press), published in 1997, Professor Nascimento mentioned that the process of spreading Chinese acupuncture in Bra-zil can be summarized in three stages - \"skepticism - denial - recog-nition\". Overall Operation Process of Promotion of TCM Culture in Brazil Until the 1970s, acupuncture was still controversial in Brazil, wavering between the labels of \"advanced medical technology\" and \"charlatan\". It is undeniable that Professor Friedrich Johann Spaeth made a great contribution to the promotion of Chinese medicine, es- pecially acupuncture, in Brazil, offering the first training course in acupuncture and Chinese medicine in 1958, founding the Brazilian Society of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine in the same year, es- tablishing the first acupuncture clinic in 1961, and founding the Bra- zilian Acupuncture Association in 1972. However, the Brazilian National Federal Medical Council consid- ered acupuncture therapy unscientific and banned its use, while taking a series of coercive measures, threats, arrests and legal proceedings against acupuncturists without medical training. Professor Spaeth, together with the S\u00e3o Paulo Acupuncture Institute, the Brazilian Acu- puncture Association, and the South American Acupuncture Federa-tion, spoke out in the Brazilian mainstream media, stating repeatedly that the root of the problem of the large number of charlatans was not the acupuncture treatment itself, but the lack of formal regulation of the spread of acupuncture in Brazil. It was not until 1977, when the Brazilian Ministry of Labor, the International Labor Organization and UNESCO reached an agreement, that the profession of acupuncturist was officially recognized in the official gazette of the Brazilian gov- ernment, and Chinese acupuncture continued to grow and develop in Brazil. In 1985, the Brazilian Federal Council of Physiotherapy and Oc- cupational Therapy decided to provide 1200 hours of professional training in acupuncture for physiotherapists; in 1986, the Federal Council of Biomedicine regulated acupuncture therapies; in 1989, the Citation: Wang R (2023) The Cultural Communication of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Brazil. J Altern Complement Integr Med 9: 343. Page 4 of 8 J Altern Complement Integr Med ISSN: 2470-7562, Open Access Journal DOI:10.24966/ACIM-7562/100343 Volume 9 Issue 3 100343Institute of Traditional Folk Medicine of the Rio de Janeiro Health Department was established, and since then, acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine have been incorporated into all levels of hospitals in the state of Rio de Janeiro; in 1995, the Federal Medical Council classified acupuncture as a medical specialty; in 1998, the Brazilian Ministry of Health incorporated acupuncture into the SUS medical system [3]. In addition, many professional organizations in Brazil, including the Brazilian Association of Physicians, the Association of Biomedical Sciences, the Association of Physical Education, the As- sociation of Speech Therapists, the Association of Dentists and the Association of Nurses, have recognized acupuncture as a continuing professional education specialty in Brazil. With the increase in the number of professionals practicing acupuncture, Brazil began its first medical residency program in acupuncture therapy in 2002. It can be seen that the promotion and dissemination of tradition - al Chinese medicine culture in Brazil did not turn into a strong and irreconcilable cultural impact, but instead triggered a series of social repercussions, and Brazilian government agencies and social groups constantly reflected on and improved their own systems in the pro-cess of the development and dissemination of TCM culture in Brazil, thus completing the \"conflict-evaluation-selection-adaptation\". Since then, the discussion related to TCM culture is no longer about wheth-er it is effective and scientific as a treatment method, but about the in-ternal regulation of the profession, such as how to identify profession-al acupuncturists. The evolution of TCM culture in Brazil reaffirms that the smooth development of foreign culture in a given country depends to a large extent on whether the dominant cultural values of the country are more tolerant, receptive, responsive and reflective of heterogeneous cultures. Analysis of the Attitudes of the Brazilian Academia and Public Toward TCM Culture Cultural evaluation is an important indicator to measure whether cultural communication has high quality characteristics, mainly refers to the people of the communication destination to make value judg- ments about the culture, such as right or wrong, good or bad, or af- firmative or negative. In the process of intercultural communication, different cultures come into contact with each other, communicate and collide with each other, so that people can recognize and understand this foreign culture and evaluate it accordingly. This article focuses on collecting and analyzing data on the cultural evaluations of TCM from the Brazilian academic community and the general public, in order to provide empirical support for the high-quality dissemination of Chinese medicine culture in Brazil. Trend and Hotspot Analysis of Thirty Years (1995- 2023.03) of TCM Research in BRAZIL BASED on Cite Space Visualization Mapping The software used for statistical analysis of the data in this arti - cle was the Cite Space application developed by Professor Chao-Mei Chen. The data source was the web of science website (WOS), and the search scope was academic journal publications. In the \"Profes- sional Search\" page of the advanced search of web of science, the lit - erature search was conducted with the theme or keyword \"Traditional Chinese Medicine\", and the search period was set as 1995-2023, the country was set as Brazil, and the collection date was April 4, 2023. The data were filtered and de-duplicated to obtain 170 valid data, which were imported into the software and converted into data format for analysis by Cite Space [4].Quantity of publications over the years Figure 1 shows the annual publication volume of TCM research in Brazil from 1995 to March 2023. In particular, from 2020 to 2021, the quantity of studies on TCM in Brazil continued to increase, reflecting the interest of Brazilian experts and scholars in the role of traditional Chinese medicine in China's successful response to the Coronavirus epidemic. However, in general, Chinese medicine research in Brazil is still a relatively new field, and there is much room for improvement in terms of research content and quantity. Distribution of research perspectives Figure 2 summarizes the distribution of specific research direc - tions for TCM research in Brazil over the last 30 years. In terms of total number of articles, 43 articles in Integrative and Complementa - ry Medicine and 37 articles in Pharmacology overwhelmingly share the top two positions. Besides that, the quantity of publications in Chemistry (22), Biochemistry/Molecular Biology (12), Plant Scienc - es (12), Toxicology (10), Neurosciences (8), Public Environmental Occupational Health (8) reflect the interest shown by the Brazilian medical community in acupuncture and the medicinal value of Chi-nese herbal medicine. The overall research in TCM in Brazil is still concentrated in the field of complementary medicine, and multidis - ciplinary and multi-perspective cross-sectional research needs to be further strengthened. Distribution of research institutions Figure 3 shows the data of the top ten research institutions in terms of quantity of publications. As can be seen in Figure 3, almost all Brazilian institutions with a high quantity of publications in the field Figure 1: Temporal distribution of annual publications on traditional Chi- nese medicine research in Brazil (1995-2023.03).

It should be noted that these Brazilian universities are \"well con- nected\" to TCM: the University of S\u00e3o Paulo is a member of the \"One Belt, One Road\" and Lusophone Countries Natural Medicines Inno-vation Consortium, and in recent years has contributed to the pro- motion of academic exchanges and cooperation between China and the Lusophone Countries in the fields of medicine. According to Dr. Daniel Feldman of this University, acupuncture is a worthwhile treat - ment for patients who have failed to respond to medication, as it may have a positive effect in relieving symptoms. The results of a clinical trial conducted jointly by the School of Dentistry of the University of Campinas and the School of Acupuncture of the Brazilian Medi- cal Association showed that acupuncture can significantly reduce the pain symptoms and improve the oral opening of patients with man- dibular joint dysfunction, which greatly improves the clinical treat - ment results. The Federal University of Santa Catarina has committed itself in recent years to inviting experts from China in fields relat - ed to TCM to Brazil to teach specialized courses, especially the use of auricular acupuncture for common clinical conditions, including insomnia, smoking, obesity, anxiety and back pain. This shows that these five universities have been deeply involved in the combination of SUS system and TCM culture in Brazil in recent years, and will be the backbone of the promotion and dissemination of TCM culture in Brazil in the future.Research hotspots The keywords were analyzed to derive the corresponding research hotspots and development trends. Other settings remain unchanged, the nodes are selected as keywords, and the Cite Space software is run to extract the statistics of keyword co-occurrence, as shown in figure 4. As can be seen from figure 4, \"traditional Chinese medicine\", \"chemical frequency and high mediat - ing centrality, suggesting that they are typical of and of most interest to the Brazilian academic community in the field of TCM research. Analysis of Brazilian People's Attitude Towards TCM Culture The foreign communication of TCM culture should include not only external promotion, but also local integration - entering the dai- ly life of local people. At present, acupuncture therapy is one of the golden signs of TCM culture promotion in Brazil, and how local peo- ple view acupuncture and the Chinese medicine culture it contains is one of the important indicators of the quality of cross-cultural com-munication. On July 13, 2022 [5], Hui Qing, vice president of the World Feder - ation of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Societies, said in an interview with Guangming.com that, \"Brazilians have a high acceptance of acupuncture\". Some people also receive acupuncture treatment reg-ularly for health care needs, \"especially some TV hosts in S\u00e3o Paulo, who like to use TCM acupuncture and Tui Na massage to relax and regulate their body and mind, in order to maintain the best condition in a stressful work rhythm\". Besides that, the former president Rous-seff and the present president of Lula, have both received acupunc- ture treatments in TCM. Lula was cured of severe frozen shoulder through acupuncture, and Rousseff was cured of a chronic disease that had plagued herself for years through acupuncture, and both have expressed their admiration for Chinese medicine, especially acupunc-ture, in more than one media interview. From this point of view, the \"star effect\" has also played a positive role in promoting the culture of TCM. According to relevant data released by the World Health Organiza - tion (WHO) in 2021, Brazil has the highest percentage of depression and anxiety disorders in the world, with the fifth highest percentage of depression cases in the world. The Brazilian population is affected by Figure 3: Top 10 institutions in Brazil in terms of research publications on Traditional Chinese Medicine (1995-2023.03).

In addition to traditional meth - ods and the use of medication, more and more Brazilian patients are seeking acupuncture as a complementary treatment. Studies by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in the United States have shown that acupuncture is effective in treating anxiety and depression, with better clinical outcomes for female patients in partic - ular. Therefore, the actual demand for treatment and relief of related conditions in Brazil, as well as the objective coverage of acupunc-ture therapy by professional institutions and mainstream media, have made Chinese acupuncture generally recognized and respected by the Brazilian public. At present, there are more than 10 acupuncture schools of different levels in Brazil, and tens of millions of Brazilian people are receiving acupuncture treatment. Prospects for the Future Development of TCM Cul - ture Promotion in Brazil This article makes a reasonable guess on the future direction of further promotion and dissemination of TCM culture in Brazil by sorting out the existing dissemination channels and results. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic in early 2020, there have been frequent exchanges and cooperation between China and Brazil on how to apply TCM to effectively respond to the epidemic. In the \"post-epidemic\" era, the cooperation between the two countries in the promotion of TCM culture is still promising, and this article focus- es on three aspects, the promotion of TCM in Brazil, the training of talents in higher education institutions, and the export of proprietary Chinese medicines. Promotion of TCM in Brazil There are already 6 medical universities in Brazil that offer acu- puncture courses and more than 10 training schools for acupuncture techniques, sending an average of more than 30,000 professional acu- puncturists to Brazilian society every year. By 2021, there were about 150,000 officially registered acupuncturists in Brazil, of which about 80% are professional doctors graduated from various medical univer - sities, and most of them are Brazilian nationals. Nearly 500 public hospitals and more than 2,500 clinics across Brazil have acupuncture treatment rooms, offering free acupuncture treatment services to the population. In September 2019, the \"Training Base of Chinese Medicine Treatment in Brazil\" jointly established by Daming Company and the Hospital of Gansu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine was officially established in S\u00e3o Paulo, and several famous Chinese doc- tors were invited to practice in Brazil, so that local people have the opportunity to enjoy quality treatment services and experience TCM culture. At the request of the Brazilian Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Association, the World Federation of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Association held a video exchange meeting com-bined Chinese and Western medicine experts and Brazilian medical experts on the prevention and control of coronavirus epidemic on August 20, 2020, to share the advanced experience in fighting the epidemic in their respective fields. Zhang Boli, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, Yang Longhui, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Liu Boyan, president of the World Federation of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Association, Li Guangxi, member of the National Health Com- mission's Coronavirus Epidemic Expert Group, and Chinese and Brazilian medical experts from Hebei College of Traditional Chi-nese Medicine, Federal University of Goi\u00e1s, Federal University of Fluminense, Federal University of Santa Maria, Brazilian Institute of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine, and many other universities attended. In the future, through the dissemination of TCM, especially the acupuncture culture in Brazil and the professional training of local doctors in TCM, the in-depth promotion of acupuncture and mox- ibustion therapy will be the starting point to provide a mature and diversified cooperation platform and channel for the dissemination and promotion of other TCM therapy method, such as Tui Na, food therapy, Tai Chi and Qigong in Brazil, as well as how to use combined Chinese and Western medicine to deal with the epidemic. Cooperation in TCM Education in Higher Educa - tion Institutions On October 25, 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping held a meet - ing with then Brazilian President Bolsonaro, who was in China on a state visit. During the meeting, the two heads of state witnessed the signing of a number of bilateral cooperation documents and an- nounced on the spot that a Confucius Institute for TCM at the Federal University of Goi\u00e1s (UFG) in Brazil will be established. There are ten Confucius Institutes in Brazil, but the Confucius Institute at UFG is the first and only Confucius Institute for Chinese Medicine, and an important platform for China to promote traditional Chinese medi - cine culture in Brazil. At present, in addition to teaching Chinese lan-guage, teachers of the Confucius Institute also teach primary Chinese language courses at the University's Faculty of Arts and Sciences and practical instruction on acupuncture therapy at the School of Nursing. The students are mainly interested in Tui Na and other Chinese med-ical methods. The Confucius Institute teachers also conduct weekly public service clinics for the faculty and staff of the university, and take the opportunity to popularize the culture of Chinese medicine and give them the opportunity to experience Tui Na, acupuncture and other Chinese medical specialties. In the future, Federal University of Goi\u00e1s plans to build on the existing cooperation with Hebei College of Traditional Chinese Medicine and continue to develop a series of majors and courses related to TCM culture. In addition to the Confucius Institute of Chinese Medicine, the Portuguese Luban Workshop jointly established by Tianjin and the Portuguese city, Set\u00fabal is also an important milestone in the dis-semination and exchange of Chinese medicine culture in Portu- guese-speaking countries. In May 2019, Pedro Dominguinhos, Pres- ident of the Portuguese Polytechnic Institute of Setubal (IPS), visited Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and discussed the progress of the joint project of acupuncture and massage education between the two universities, teacher training, student exchange, ac- ademic seminars and during the meeting with the Tianjin delegation, the President of IPS promised to share the successful experience of Luban Workshop in IPS with Brazil and other Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa. After that, a delegation from the Federal Univer - sity of Santa Catarina visited IPS in January 2020 and showed great interest in the Luban workshop, which laid the foundation for the fu-ture cooperation between China and Brazil in the creation of \"Luban Workshop of Chinese Medicine in Brazil\". Due to the impact of the new epidemic, cross-border exchanges between Chinese and Brazilian personnel have been hampered, but the demand for training local Chinese medicine students in Brazil has Citation: Wang R (2023) The Cultural Communication of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Brazil. J Altern Complement Integr Med 9: 343. Page 7 of 8 J Altern Complement Integr Med ISSN: 2470-7562, Open Access Journal DOI:10.24966/ACIM-7562/100343 Volume 9 Issue 3 100343not decreased. In the future, there is a need to digitally reform the sharing model of TCM teaching resources and research data to pro-vide technological guarantee for TCM higher education cooperation and cultural exchange between the two countries. In the \"post-epi - demic era\", both countries need to ensure the quality of education of TCM culture in Brazilian universities as much as possible by design-ing catechism courses, holding regular online lecture seminars and building shared databases from the actual needs of student training. Export of Proprietary Chinese Medicines In recent years, the Chinese government has been paying more at- tention to the overseas dissemination of Chinese medicine, and in Jan- uary 2022, the government issued the \"Development Plan for Promot- ing the High-Quality Integration of Chinese Medicine into the \"Belt and Road\" [6], which aims to comprehensively improve the quality and level of Chinese medicine's participation in the \"Belt and Road\". In March, 2022, the General Office of the National Council issued the \"14th Five-Year Plan for the Development of Chinese Medicine\", which also mentions accelerating the open development of Chinese medicine and promoting the high-quality integration of Chinese med-icine into the \"Belt and Road\" initiative [7]. For example, Fang Fang, director of Training Base of Chinese Medicine Treatment in Brazil, has been working for more than 10 years to set up a team to communicate and negotiate with Brazilian and Chinese institutions, with the aim of getting the Brazilian author - ities to gradually recognize the theory of TCM. More than 50 kinds of Chinese medicines, including Lianhua Qingwen Capsules, have already been licensed for import into Brazil. However, there are still many bottlenecks for the introduction and promotion of TCM in Brazil, and a large quantity of TCM products are still facing difficulties in registration and access as \"drugs\", and can only appear as \"food additives\". In response to this phenome - non, the Chinese government should accelerate the improvement of the top-level design layout, strategically encourage domestic Chinese medicine enterprises with high quality and characteristics to speed up the process of standardization and transformation of relevant propri-etary Chinese medicine, strengthen the communication and coordi- nation with the Brazilian government level so as to promote Chinese medicine legislation and promote the mutual recognition of Chinese medicine products standards between China and Brazil. Relevant pharmaceutical companies should accelerate the process of techno - logical innovation and product development and promote the inte - gration of Chinese and Western medical resources to enhance their international competitiveness [8-17]. Conclusion In the process of multicultural development in the world, Chinese culture can only reveal its unique charm that distinguishes it from other cultures in the process of collision, exchange and intermingling with foreign cultures, so that it can go global faster and better. But whether it is exchange or intermingling, it is not and should not be simple \"transplantation\" or \"assimilation\", but rather the creation of Chinese cultural \"international business cards\" with its own distinc - tive characteristics. As the world's two of largest economies and important members of the BRICS, China and Brazil have a strong potential for cooper - ation in the promotion and exchange of Chinese medicine culture. Based on the strong interest of Brazilian people in Chinese medicine, especially in acupuncture, the future cooperation between China and Brazil in acupuncture therapy is very promising. Besides that, the role of TCM is gradually being noticed by the world in the context of the global response to the Coronavirus epidemic, and the Brazilian government and public will have a more comprehensive knowledge of TCM culture in the future through the reports of the successful ex- perience of combining Chinese and Western medicine in the response to the epidemic by the major news media in China and Brazil. To sum up, the cooperation between China and Brazil in the pro- motion of Chinese medicine culture has both medical and diplomatic values. In the context of the 10th anniversary of the \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative, the dissemination and promotion of TCM culture in Brazil will have a historic opportunity, and will become an important link between the population of China and Brazil. The two countries should continue to cooperate in the promotion of TCM culture, jointly promote the construction of a \"health community\" and accelerate the building of a community of human destiny.
