Harris Institution: Iowa State University Date Received: September 2, 2003 Abstract: Two transmission models were utilized to determine if rapid dissemination of Salmonella Typhimurium in pigs could be prevented by either live avirulent vaccines or spray-dried plasma. The 2 models were: (1) in tranasal inoculation of a high dose of S. Typhimurium and (2) natural tr ansmission of the organism by contamination of the pen environment with Salmone lla infected seeder pigs. T hese models mimi c an important mode of pork contamination which occurs du ring transport and lairage immediately prior to slaughter. Avirulent live vaccines for the prevention of disease caused by Salmonella Choleraesuis did not protect pi gs against the rapid dissemina tion of S. Typhimurium in either model. Spray-dried plasma did not protect pigs against S. Typhimurium using model 1. Live avirulent vaccines are likely effective in decreasing the level of Salmonella in tissues at slaughter (based on previously reported field investigations); however, this effect occurs during the finish er phase of production, not during transport and lairage. Introduction: As the importance of food safety in the pork chain continues to elevate, so does the need to identify and address points of interventio n in pork production. While no one critical control point for food safety may supercede the importance of another, it is important to understand al l mechanisms of contaminatio n associated with a target organism. One such point is the idea of rapid extraintestinal dissemination (RED) of Salmonella spp. in swine.(Loynachan et al. , 2001) In 1995, Fedorka-Cray et al. described Salmonella invasion using esophagotomized pigs in which Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium was isolated from lymph nodes and cecum three hours after intranasal inoculation.(Fedorka-Cray et al. , 1994) In 1999, Vazquez-Torres et al. described a mechanism of Salmonella dissemination in which organisms are transported from the gastrointestinal tract of mice to the bloodstream by CD18-expressing phagocytes.(Vazquez-Torres et al. , 1999) All three of thes e studies suggest that hematogenous spread of Salmonella can occur very qui ckly and be a source of both gastrointestinal and internal tissue contamination. 2 In 1987, Morgan et al. described the effe ct of time in lairage on Salmonella contamination of slaugh ter pigs.(Morgan, Krautil, and Cr aven, 1987) They showed that the percentage of pigs carrying Salmonella in their ceca increased directly with the time spent in lairage. Recent work by Hurd et al . has shown that Salmonella infection of pigs occurs in less than 2-3 hours after being placed in pens which previously housed Salmonella infected pigs shedding the organism in their feces.(Hurd et al. , 2001) This same group has al so shown that pi gs at slaughter contain additional se rovars not recovered from cohort pigs at the farm of origin. (McKean et al. , 2001) There are various commercially availabl e Salmonella vaccines that have been shown to be efficacious for reducing infecti on. In 1992, Kramer et al. described an avirulent Salmonella Choleraesuis strain 54 (Sc54, BI-Vetmedica) ob tained from repeated neutrophil passage(Roof et al. , 1992). This strain was shown to reduce salmonellosis when administered to pigs via drinking water at 10 9 CFU/dose. Letellier et al. showed an increased im mune response following Sc54 treatment and suggested that IgA, cellular immunity, and cytokines are involved in reduction of S. Typhimurium in the ileum and mesenteric lymph nodes(Letellier et al. , 2000). Another available vaccine is S. Choleraesuis cya, crp-cdt (Argus, Intervet Inc.). Studies by Charles et al. in 2000 showed reduced sh edding and clinical signs in pigs vaccinated with this strain and subsequently challenged with S. Typhimuriu m (Charles et al. , 2000). Upon necropsy, significantly fewer tissues were positive for S. Typhimurium in vaccinated vs nonvaccinated pigs. Studies by Maes et al. have shown Argus cross protection against other Salmonella serogroups . Vaccinate groups with a highe r seropositivi ty coincided with a significant lower amount of positive lymph nodes at slaughter. (Maes et al. , 2001) It seems likely that increased contamination following lairage and RED are closely related. It is possible that Salmone lla-free pigs may become contaminated from the time they leave the farm to the time they are on the rail through direct contact with contaminated trucks, facilit ies, and/or commingling with infected pi gs. Although commercial vaccines have been shown to work in long-term trials, there is no work focusing on acute infection. Objectives: 1. Compare different challenge doses to determine the relationship between extent of infectio n and challenge dose. 2. Develop a natural chal lenge model for acute infe ction using seeder pigs. 3. Determine if experimental pigs vaccinated with live avirulent vaccines are resistant to acute infection of Salmone lla when challenged with a virulent Salmonella isolate. 4. Determine if experimental pigs given spray-dried plasma before challenge are resistant to acute Salmonella infection. Materials and Methods: Objective 1 : Pigs were randomized into three groups; group 1 (3 pigs) challenged with 1x10 8 cfu of S. Typhimurium 4232, group 2 (3 ) challenged with 1x105 cfu of S. Typhimurium 4232, and 3 ( 2 pigs ) of strict neg ative control. Three hours after intranasal c hallenge, all pigs were euthanized and necropsied. At necropsy, samples were collected as follows: blood, liv er, tonsil, lung, spleen, ceum and colon content. For qualitative analysi s of Salmonella, tissues were macerated by a hammer in sample bags and added by BPW broth at the rate of 9ml to 1g of samples. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C overnight, 100 \u00b5l of the BPW culture were transferred into 9ml RV broth and incubated at 42 \u00b0C overnight. The next day, 100\u00b5l of the RV culture were transferred and spread onto XLD agar plate co ntaining 50\u00b5g/ml of nalidixic acid, and 3 incubated 37 \u00b0C overnight. Suspected Salmonella colonies on XLD plates were further tested with a slide agglutination test with Salmonella O-antisera. Objective 2 : Pigs found to be free of Salmonella by serology, rectal swabs, and pen fecal samples were divided into strict negative, positive exposure, and seeder groups. Four pigs designated as seeder pigs were intranasally inoculated with 6.95 x 10 9 cfu of Salmonella Typhimurium . Seeder pigs were allowed to contaminate their environment for 40 hours via feca l shedding at which time the positive control treatment group was placed into the Salmonella contaminated. Pen fecal samples were collected prior to introduction of treatment animals into the contaminated environment and after all animals had been ne cropsied. Three hours post exposure to the Salmonella contaminated environment the animals we re euthanized and the following tissue samples were aseptically collected S. typhimurium culture: tonsil, mandibular ents, ileocecal lymph node, jejunal lymph node, ileum, skin swab, nasal turbinate swab, heart valve swab, and stomach content swab. Culture was performed as for objective 1. Objective 3 : Two different trials were completed to evaluate vaccine. In trial 1, twenty-four pigs were obtained and randomly divi ded into four groups as follows: group 1 (no vaccination, no chall enge), group 2 (vaccinated, no challenge), group 3 (no vaccination, challenged), and group 4 (vaccinated, challe nged). Challe nge dose was 3x10 9 and Salmonella culture was as descr ibed above. No pigs in any group seroconverted based on the Danish mix-ELISA. All controls were Salmonella negative. Qualitative results fo r challenged pigs showed no sign ificant differenc e and are shown below. Quantification of alimentary tissues was not possible in this trial except for tonsils, which showed no signifi cant difference between groups. In trial 2, the natural exposure model us ing seeder pigs as described above was used. Thirty-eight pigs were randomly divided into group 1 (no vaccination, no exposure), group 2 (seeder pigs), group 3 (non-vaccinated, exposed), and group 4 (vaccinated, exposed). Both groups 3 and 4 were divided in half so that 7 pigs were necropsied at 3 hours post exposure and 7 at 6 hours post exposure. Vaccination was intranasal with an avirulent S. Choleraesuis strain . Seeders were chal lenged with 5.7 x 10 9 cfu of virulent S. Typhimuium and al lowed to contaminate the pen for 36 hours before introduction of groups 3 and 4. Sa lmonella culture following necropsy was as above. Objective 4 : Twenty five pigs were divided into three groups as follows: group 1 (no plasma, no challenge), gr oup 2 (no plasma, challenge d), and group 3 (plasma, challenged). Pigs were o ffered either normal water for co ntrol groups while the solutein group received water mixed with spray-dried plasma according to manufacturer's instructions. Challe nge titer was 3x10 9 cfu and Salmonella culture was as above. Results: Objective 1 : Pigs challenged with the lower dose had fewer organs Salmonella culture positive after three hours, most notably those of non-alimentary origin. 4 Objective 2 : Seeder pigs were found to shed, on average, 4.78 X 104 Salmonella Typhimurium per gram of feces 20 hours after intranasal inoculation. Pigs were found to be acutely infected with Salmonella within three hours of exposure to a Salmonella contaminated environm ent (see table 1). Table 1.

Qualitative data is shown in Table 3. Table 3: Comparison of acute Salmonella infection of pigs with or without spray-dried plasma Discussion: Salmonella Typhimurium disseminates rapidly to the intestinal tract and non-alimentary tissues of pigs within hours after exposure either by intranasal inoculation or via contaminated pen environment. Currently available Salmonella Choleraesuis live avirulent vaccines are efficacious for the prevention of disease caused by S. Choleraesuis. This re search was conducted to determine if these same vaccines could prevent infection by Salmonella Ty phimurium, an import ant human foodborne pathogen present in pigs pre-harvest. Two tran smission models were utilized to determine if rapid dissemination of Salmonella Typhimurium in pigs could be prevented by either live avirulent vaccines or spray-dried plasma. The 2 models were: (1) intranasal inoculation of a high dose of S. Typhimurium and (2) natu ral transmission of the organism by contamination of the pen environment with Salmonella infected seeder pigs. These models mimic an important mode of pork contami nation which occurs during transport and lairage immediately prior to slaughter. Avirulent live vaccines for the prevention of disease caused by Salmonella Choleraesuis did not protect pi gs against the rapid dissemina tion of S. Typhimurium in either model. Spray-dried plasma did not protect pigs against S. Typhimurium using model 1. Live avirulent vaccines are likely effective in decreasing the level of Salmonella in tissues at slaughter (based on previously reported field investigations); however, this effect occurs during the finisher phase of production, not during transport and lairage. Lay Interpretation: Currently available Salmonella Choler aesuis live avirulent vaccines are efficacious for the prevention of disease caused by S. Choleraesuis. This research was conducted to determine if these same vaccines co uld prevent in fection by Salmonella Typhimurium, an im portant human foodbor ne pathogen pres ent in pigs pre- harvest.

Typhimurium when pigs ar e challenged either with a high dose (intranasal) or a low dose (natural challenge via pen contamination) of the organism. It is very likely these avirulent vaccines do decrease the levels of Salmonella in pigs at slaughter but this protection oc curs when pigs are exposed to Salmonella during the finishing phase of production, not during transport and lairage. Treatment of pigs with spray-dried plasma does no t prevent the rapid dissemination of S. Typhimurium.
