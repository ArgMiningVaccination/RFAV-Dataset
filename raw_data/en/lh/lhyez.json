I remain calm and confident when faced with sarcasm, ridicule, or poorly handled criticism. 3. It's easy for me to lose my temper. 4. I address problems directly without blame or judgment. 5. It's more important that I get what I want, rather than people liking me. 6. I am easily upset or intimidated by ridicule or sarcasm. 7. I really don't like conflict, so I use other ways to make my feelings known, such as impatient or sarcastic remarks. 8. I'll use sarcasm or little jokes to make my point. 9. I feel comfortable with the amount of eye contact I make with other people. 10. I'll use the volume of my voice or sarcasm to get what I want from others. 11. I feel confident to handle most work situations positively involving confrontation with other people. 12. I like it better when people figure out what I want, without me having to tell them. 13. If asked to do something I don't want to do, I'll do it, but deliberately won't do it as well as I could. 14. Being liked by people is very impor tant to me, even if that means not getting my needs met. 15. I may not be very direct with people, but they can tell what I think of them by just looking at me. 16. I really don't like conflict and will avoid it any way that I can. 17. I feel it is alright to ask for what I want or to explain how I feel. 18. Any impatience I feel for other people comes out in my body language rather than my telling the other person about it directly. 19. I find it easy to poke, or wag, my index finger at other people. 20. Patience with people is not one of my strong points.

Banayan, MD. MSc. FRCPC Assistant Professor, Section of Psychiatry & Medicine Director, Transplant Psychiatry Program Co-Director, M4 Elective in Consult Psychiatry Specialist, Psychosomatic Medicine & Clinical Medical Ethics David_Banayan@Rush.eduThe information contained in this presentation is for educational purposes only. OBJECTIVES 1.To understand the role, relevance and importance of clinical medical ethics. 2.To become familiar with some of the core theories of medical ethics. 3.To practice applying theories of clinical medical ethics to dilemmas that can arise in the clinical (teaching) environment. WHAT IS CLINICAL MEDICAL ETHICS Ethics: Theory about which actions / behaviors are 'correct' usu. based upon pre -existing established standards of conduct or rights e.g. Constitutional Rights; Federal & State Laws; Religious doctrines, Others... Medical Ethics = defining what actions/behaviors/goals/etc. are appropriate in health care settings. e.g. Hippocratic Oath \"First, do no harm\"WHAT IS CLINICAL MEDICAL ETHICS Clinical Medical Ethics: ethical issues arising in the delivery of health care and caring for the ill. Conflicts of interest between provider & patient Behavioral 'indiscretions' between providers and across the health professions Conflicts between ethical principles (e.g. HIPAA violation for public safety)THE TROLLEY PROBLEM The axe problem UTILITARIANISM / CONSEQUENTIALISM Focus: maximizing production of 'the good' 'good' = well being, contentment , welfare, choice, etc. When a 'good' is not achievable minimize harm. e.g. 'Harm reduction' model in txof substance use d/o Outcome from the act mostly determines whether the act was morally just. -The end may justify the means. Drawbacks Good for greatest number can marginalize minority groups No mention of how a 'good' is distributed Comparing consequences of different actions -using what scale?Deontology Definition: The study of duty and obligation Progenitor: Kant Focus: Reason, duty, rules, form the basis of moral judgement. Quality, nature of relationships; what we owe others. Human capacity for reason Acting out of obligation Examples: Fiduciary duty of health care providers Fiduciary duty of financial advisors AMA -Policies, etc.Deontology Example: Employer tells worker that she was exposed to a hazmat . Is this moral or amoral ? Judgment :Depends on whyemployer said it. -duty to tell or workplace rule = moral worth -because fears lawsuit = no moral worthRights Theory Definition : entitlement to something Justification of a right : philosophical, constitutional, political, legal, religious, etc. -Right to live freely without undue intrusion -Right to non -discrimination -Right to free speech -...plethora of other rightsChoosing How Behave Consequentialism (Utilitarianism): maximized good Deontology: relationships; respecting humanity, Theory: to achieve Eudaimonia (human flourishing) Rights Theory: 'do unto others...' / certain rights inalienableEthics v. The Law Ethical choices / response can breach legal statutes! e.g. Patient diverting large amounts of a controlled substance Report to DEA (HIPAA) v. other responseEthical Dilemmas in Clinical Settings Consultation Request Refusals Communication style -demeanor, tone, paucity of, not returning pages, physical touch Patient Endangerment / Negligence / Competency Boundary crossings / violations with -colleagues, pts, families Ethical violationsQUESTIONS?BREAKOUT SESSIONS!

He frequently fails to share data from his experiments which negatively impacts your work. This pattern has impacted your performance and the performance of the department. How would you structure your dialogue with Jon using the STATE skills? S = Share your facts -Jon you have not shared the data from the previous two experiments that were conducted on 9/18 and 9/25 . This has seriously impacted my ability to successfully conduct my experiments. It also has had a negative impact on the productivity of our department . T = Tell your Story -I am starting to feel like either you do not care or you do not understand how your lack of sharing data impacts others. This has started to impact my relationship with you. A = Ask for others path -How do you see it ? What is your perspective?16STATE SKILLS PRACTICE IN PAIRS One of your employees, Jenna, who was a good performer for the last five years is underperforming. She has started to show up late at work. Her two key projects have fallen behind. Her negativity is impacting her work and the work of her peers. Use STATE skills to structure your dialogue with Jenna. 17Any questions? 1 How do difficult behaviors relate to the drivers? 4 3 2 1 I want to get it done I want to get it right I want to get along I want to be appreciated Tanks Yes People Downer Know it All Paired Exercise 2 STATE SKILLS PRACTICE IN PAIRS One of your employees, Jenna, who was a good performer for the last five years is underperforming.

It is best accomplished through cooperative processes that include all stakeholders. Practices and programs reflecting restorative practices will respond to (mis)behavior by: -identifying and taking steps to repair harm, -involving all stakeholders, -fostering active accountability , and -transforming the traditional relationship between communities and empowered bodies in responding to behavior. A flexible approach with potential utility across settings and circumstancesRestorative Questions \"What happened?\" \"What harm resulted?\" \"What needs to be done to make things right?\" \"What will prevent it from happening again?\"\"Do not be daunted by the enormity of the world's grief. Do justly, now. Love mercy, now. Walk humbly, now.
