Vyse stated that autism is a \"psychiatric disorder.\" This is incorrect. Although still listed as psychiatric in the DSM, it is actually neurological in origin, not psychological. That's not to say that autistic people can't have psychiatric conditions in addition to autism, however. Also, it is more accurately considered a developmental disability than a \"disorder.\" Lynn Bachhuber Portland, Oregon Stuart Vyse responds: The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which is published by the American Psychiatric Association, makes no claims about the causes of autism. Although autism spectrum disorder likely does have neurological origins, autism\u2014like all the mental disorders in the book\u2014is defined by its observable features. The terms psychiatric disorder and mental disorder carry no implications about the origin of the condition. Devil's Baby of Ravenswood I am both an avid reader of Skeptical Inquirer and a lifelong West Virginia resident. I grew up in Parkersburg, West Virginia, and during the early 1980s dated a girl from Ravenswood. Even then we knew about the legend (urban myth) of \"The Devil's Baby.\" We would cruise by the cemetery drinking beer (among other things!) and teasing the girls in the car about dropping them off at the gate and leaving them to deal with the \"devil's child.\" All in good fun! You can imagine my surprise when I received one of my favorite magazines in the mail at the end of December, and right there on the cover is a photo from the old Ravenswood graveyard, with an article inside containing a scientific investigation of the \"Devil Baby\" grave (\"The Case of the Devil's Baby of Ravenswood\" by Daniel A. Reed, January/February 2023). C'mon! You are better than that! Such nonsense does not deserve the cover of a two-page student newsletter from a grade school, let alone a reputable magazine such as Skeptical Inquirer! The article was well written, the research well done, but the topic ... The topic was not worthy (IMHO) of such exposure. Bill Bradley Fairmont, West Virginia Benjamin Radford responds: As a folklorist, I take light umbrage at Bill Bradley's description of the Reed article as \"such nonsense.\" By what measure is it \"nonsense\"? Is that specific legend or belief any less \"nonsensical\" than other topics that routinely appear on our cover, from QAnon conspiracies to creationism, ghosts to UFO reports? Of course that particular article is not hard-hitting journalism; folklore rarely is. But it's well within the purview of Skeptical Inquirer and always has been. As editors we rarely decide that a proposed topic is too silly or stupid to address, because some people (often, many people) believe them. Other times the article reveals instructive themes in psychology and folklore. As Bradley admits, \"The article was well written, the research well done.\" That's much of our criteria, and if Bradley has no interest in folkloric articles he is under no obligation to read them. Religious Responses to the JWST Manfred Cuntz (\"The James Webb Space Telescope: First Responses from Religion,\" January/February 2023) correctly observes that Big Bang deniers have attempted to capitalize on the title of a recent astronomy paper titled \"Panic! at the Disks,\" but neither he nor they seem to have noticed that the title playfully alludes to the name of a popular music group, Panic! at the Disco. Such allusions are not uncommon; a 2018 study found almost 600 biomedical scientific publications with titles containing references to songs by The Beatles. Glenn Branch National Center for Science Education Oakland, California In the article by Manfred Cuntz, the author gives as an example of \"quote mining\" the reference by young-earth creationism proponent Ken Ham to the manuscript titled \"Panic! At the Disks: First Rest-frame Optical Observations of Galaxy Structure at z > 3 with JWST in the SMACS 0723 Field.\" Ham apparently has taken the title at face value and has obviously not read the manuscript, as there is no real indication of panic on anyone's part. Rather, the authors of the manuscript describe the valuable and unexpected data newly revealed by the JWST, welcoming the opportunity to reexamine and perhaps revise our current understanding of the formation of our universe. Exciting stuff! Ham goes out of his way to expound upon the \"panic\" while Cuntz characterizes the title of this manuscript as \"a bit lurid.\" I'm afraid both Cuntz and Ham have taken much too seriously a simple play on words, an allusion to an early 2000s rock band that some of us may be familiar with, Panic! at the Disco. (The reference popped into my head as soon as I read it.) The idea that the surfeit of disk galaxies observed by the JWST was totally unexpected must have been what inspired the Panic! ... Disks reference. I think it's rather amusing and indicates a sense of humor on the part of the Panic! authors. Linda Ferrazzara Randolph, Massachusetts Identifying Unsubstantiated Claims The January/February 2023 article \"Identifying Unsubstantiated Claims\" by D. Alan Bensley states \"For instance, the claim that thimerosal in MMR vaccines causes autism is pseudoscientific.\" This inadvertently perpetuates a false claim. Per the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html), \"Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines (chickenpox), inactivated polio (IPV), and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have also never contained thimerosal.\" The current myth that the MMR vaccine contains (or contained) thimerosal appears to be a result of American concerns about thimerosal in non-MMR vaccines merging with the British concerns about the MMR vaccine (originating from Wakefield's discredited studies). Andrew Love Columbia, Maryland Ecocognition and Climate Change After subscribing for a year, I will not be renewing. When I first saw ads for the magazine, I thought that being skeptical was the point. Many of the articles were interesting, but also many were so obscure as not to provoke my interest. One topic that does interest me is climate change, which was originally called \"global warming\" until it was hard to find any. The article \"Ecocognition: Observation and Interpretation in the Understanding of Climate Change\" by Matthew Sharps et al. (January/February 2023) started with the faulty premise \"Climate change is obviously real\u2014and urgent.\" Well changing climate is real and has been occurring ever since there was enough gas accumulating on our cooling rock to make weather and over time climate. The \"obviously real\" is not, and most examples in the media should be properly reported as weather. The fact that a group of scientists form a consensus that something is true does not make it so. Neither do the climate models that seem to be the only place where catastrophes can be found. Looking at the data, I find nothing to fear from the climate, but I do have great fear what will be done to our civilization by activists and governments proposing solutions that are far more destructive than climate change. There are climatologists who have a far different view of the future, but they are often shunned and censored, especially on social media. I have not seen any of these skeptics in the pages of your magazine for a topic that is \"obviously real\u2014and urgent.\" It makes me think that only proper skeptics need apply. Tim Shankland Helena, Montana Matthew Sharps responds: Climate change is of course real and has been a major feature of the earth since the planet's origin. The topic has, however, become \"urgent\" as human beings have begun to respond to weather and climate change without necessarily having access to accurate facts or interpretations and with psychological proclivities that may prove suboptimal for rational consideration of the relevant long- and short-term issues. The point of the article was neither to affirm nor to deny popular attitudes toward weather or climate change but to report on psychological attributes that may have a very real bearing on the interpretation of weather- and climate-related phenomena. Sharps et. al. state that \"Some popular environmental beliefs simply do not survive the test of scientific skepticism ...\" and then gave two examples. The first is that \"Old growth forests are beloved; yet old-growth forests, wonderful for spotted owls, are bad for the endangered Kirtland's warbler, as the expansion of old growth reduces the fire-dependent jack pine forests that the warbler requires.\" Yet the owl lives exclusively in the West, along the Pacific coast and Southwestern states, while the warbler lives exclusively in a tiny region of north-central Michigan. That's like claiming that Manhattan high-rise development conflicts with Iowa hog farming; there is no connection whatsoever. Anyone familiar with the science will know that species with particular habitat preferences can't just up and move across the continent. The second example claims that \"the abolition of pesticide deemed environmentally hazardous has been associated with enormous increases in human death rates from malaria.\" But the source they cite says nothing about that, only that some U.S. farmers who replaced DDT with the far more toxic Parathion and ignored the safety warnings suffered illness or death. True, although malaria has been all but eliminated in the United States, it is still a problem in third-world countries. But they do use DDT, to which many mosquitoes have unfortunately developed resistance. Malaria research is ongoing; those countries have not been abandoned to their fate. If these are the best examples, I think the world is still safe from environmentalism running amok. I'm more concerned about anti-environmentalism masquerading as science. Robert Masta Ann Arbor, Michigan Matthew Sharps responds: As stated in the article, the two examples of conflicting agendas in the realm of climate policy were not intended to be comprehensive. They were intended to be examples of the fact that environmental policies, even if well-intentioned, may have negative consequences that are unforeseen. No one anticipates that a California owl is ever likely to meet a Michigan warbler; the example was a demonstration that climate policies that might aid one species in one context may be deleterious if applied to a different species in a different context. The example concerning rising malarial rates was also not intended as a comprehensive review; the point was, again, that a well-intentioned climate policy may have negative consequences. Malaria has once again become a significant public health concern, with huge personal consequences, for great numbers of people throughout much of the world. Although DDT is of course still in use, it is used much less than formerly and has been abolished in much of the world by means of various policies. A major replacement for DDT resulted in the deaths of many farm workers, who were provided with this highly toxic substance while their entire experience was with much less hazardous chemicals; blaming their deaths on their failure to read \"safety warnings\" seems unreasonable. These examples were included to demonstrate potential conflicts between positive and negative effects of climate policies, but only in that regard did they have anything to do with the point of the article, which was to demonstrate human psychological tendencies that may influence judgment and interpretation in climate-related areas. The article was not about climate change; it concerned the psychology of human responses to climate change. What we reported here was the fact that considerations of climate may not have their origins solely in an objective consideration of the natural world; human psychology enters the situation and may render judgments in the environmental realm highly subjective. Given the current political importance of various aspects of the climate debate, we stand by the concept that the psychology of climate change is very worthy of research attention. The Night Begins to Shine My son and I took great joy and a chuckle upon reading Nathan H. Lents's article title \"The Night Begins to Shine: The Tapetum Lucidum and Our Backward Retinas\" in the January/February 2023 copy of our beloved Skeptical Inquirer. Are we presuming correctly that Lents is a fan of the musical group B.E.R. as made famous in the cartoon Teen Titans Go! in choosing the first five words of the headline? Wonderfully fascinating article either way. Erik (and Wesley) Radloff Milwaukee, Wisconsin Political Bias in SI I have been a reader/subscriber on and off for a long time. In fact, I have a copy of Vol. 1, no. 1 of The Zetetic. The reason I occasionally let my subscription lapse is to get a break from the political slant in your columns and editorials. The first issue of my current subscription is January/February 2023. The column by Massimo Pigliucci includes the completely gratuitous disclaimer, \"Of course, just because Trump supports an idea doesn't mean that the idea itself is bad.\" I couldn't find the one that said, \"Just because Biden is hopelessly senile doesn't mean all his policies are stupid.\" Then, in a book review by Richard Dawkins, is a reference (also completely gratuitous) to \"Donald Trump and his odious acolytes.\" I get it. Most of your contributors are college instructors. Practically by definition they are liberal Democrats hovering on the far-left fringe of reality. I will stipulate to that. You really don't need to prove it in every issue. Paul Kelly Delta, Colorado Senile Dementia Editors note: The first version of Ward Becker's letter was written before he knew that Dr. Harriet Hall had died. We wanted to publish the letter because it provides some useful information, and as a result we gave the writer the opportunity to revise the letter. I was saddened to learn that Dr. Harriet Hall had suddenly died and offer my condolences to her family. Her articles were always thoroughly researched and informative, and her voice will be sorely missed. In \"Antioxidants: The Hype and the Reality\" (January/February 2023), she used the term senile dementia. As a geriatrician, I do not use this term because it could be misinterpreted as implying that the aging process causes dementia. It is true that the prevalence of dementia does increase with age, but aging in the absence of disease is not a cause. Dementia is a medical syndrome that is a collection of signs and symptoms. It is not a diagnosis by itself and requires an evaluation to determine a specific cause or causes. The dementia syndrome can be defined as an acquired intellectual deficit of sufficient severity to interfere with social and/or occupational functioning. It has a pathological memory impairment and at least one other component, such as personality changes, difficulties with judgments, speech, abstract reasoning, planning, or decision making, among others. There are many causes of dementia with Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body disease, or vascular dementia (multiple causes, including stroke) being the most frequent. An individual can have multiple causes of dementia concurrently. Lastly, every cause of dementia can be characterized as reversible/irreversible and nonprogressive/progressive. Reversible means a known treatment can restore partially or completely the lost function. For example, at present Alzheimer's disease is irreversible and progressive. Ward G. Becker, MD Kutztown, Pennsylvania Homeopathy Because homeopathy keeps returning to the pages of Skeptical Inquirer, I remind readers that homeopathy is quackery with dilutions of grandeur. Richard Stallman East Boston, Massachusetts UFOs over Kyiv Re: \"UFOs over Kyiv\" by Mick West (January/February 2023). Interesting story. Surprised there was no reference to the classic Poe short story \"The Sphinx,\" in which a closely observed insect is misperceived as a distant monster. Richard Babyak Parma, Ohio Harriet Hall Like many, I was saddened by the recent passing of Dr. Harriet Hall. As someone who received her SkepDoc newsletter, I dearly hope the skeptic community can find somebody to pick up the torch and carry on her work, which is extremely important. A key reason her work was so important is the utter failure of mainstream journalism to properly cover alternative medicine quackery. I would love to see you investigate that matter of why mainstream journalists aren't pursuing this topic. I would love to see you call up the health and medical writers for the Post, the Times, and all the rest and flat out ask them to explain their silence. Record their responses and write an article about it. Be sure to forward a copy to the Columbia Journalism Review. My suspicion is that many mainstream journalists actually believe the nonsense. My guess is that a great many of them are taking useless supplements, getting acupuncture, or visiting chiropractors. If so, then the public needs to be informed of that. The public needs to know that mainstream journalists, the self-appointed guardians of truth, are failing their jobs miserably, and that has serious consequences for public health. Anyway, that's my suggestion. Hope you will give it some thought. You publish an excellent magazine. I always look forward to it. Richard Babyak Parma, Ohio "}
