If you're having back or neck pain, seeing a chiropractor can help relieve that pain. Chiropractic care can also help manage any pain all over the body so you can live pain-free. However, you may not know that chiropractic care can help boost your immune system. How can chiropractic care improve your immune system? What is the Immune System? First things first, the [immune system](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/the-immune-system) is what protects your body from any external invaders and keeps you healthy. This includes harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi, and toxins. The immune system is made up of different proteins, organs, and cells (like white blood cells) all working in conjunctions to help your body. A strong immune system helps your body defend itself from getting sick. As long as your immune system is doing its job, you shouldn't be getting ill. Unfortunately, your immune system can't stop everything. If it isn't working as intended you may get sick. Our Immune Systems Are Important By boosting our immune systems, we help our body stay healthy. Our immune system helps fight off disease. Lowered immune issues can lead to complications like allergies, asthma, colds, and the flu. Some cancers can be attributed to low immune response. Taking care of your immune system, in turn, helps you take care of your entire body. Less illness lets you spend more of your time doing what you want to do, instead of working towards feeling better. How Chiropractic Care Can Help While things like eating right and exercise can help your immune system, so can chiropractic care. Chiropractic care assists the nervous system, which a majority of which is housed in your spinal cord. By adjusting and reducing the pressure along your spine, you're helping how quickly your nervous system can detect and respond. The quicker your body can respond to external threats, the easier your immune system can get rid of the threats. If you're having problems with your neck or back, it could be inadvertently making it more difficult for your nervous system to work because of pressure on the nerves. The communication between the brain and body can be slowed or stopped by pressure on the nerve roots. A good analogy is standing on a soft garden hose and trying to water your tomatoes. That break in communication in your body can really cause a struggle for your immune system the same way lack of water to a plant will affect its health. By taking care of your spine, you take care of your overall health. Summary How can chiropractic care improve your immune system? By taking care of your spinal cord you help your nervous system, immune system, and overall health.
