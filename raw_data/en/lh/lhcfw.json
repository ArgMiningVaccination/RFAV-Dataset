Failure to properly store and handle vaccines results in financial loss, revaccination, and reduced public confidence in vaccines. Vaccines that have been exposed to improper conditions have reduced potency, resulting in inadequate immune response and poor protection against disease. The temperature -controlled environment used to maintain and transport vaccines in optimal condition is called the vaccine cold chain . The cold chain begins with the storage unit at the manufacturing plant, extends to the transport and delivery of vaccine and storage at a clinic, and ends with administration of the vaccine to a patient. Every time a vaccine is exposed to improper conditions (e.g., overexposure to heat, cold, or light), its potency is reduced. If a refrigerated vaccine is exposed to freezing temperature just once, its potency can be destroyed. This document is designed to assist providers in properly storing and handling federal COVID -19 vaccine as part of the Tennessee Vaccine -Preventable Diseases and Immunization Program (VPDIP) COVID -19 Vaccination Program. It is a modified version of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Storage and Handling Toolkit , which y ou are highly recommended to review in order to fully An effective vaccine cold chain relies on... 4 understand the breadth of information, recommendations, and resources available to assist you in properly storing and handling yo ur vaccine supply. CDC's You Call the Shots Module Ten is also a recommended training for understanding vaccine storage and handling. Always refer to the manufacturer information and package inserts or contact the manufacture r directly for detailed storage and handling protocols for individual vaccines. Section Two: Staff and Training Clearly written, detailed, and up -to-date storage and handling standard operating procedures (SOPs) will help your facility stay organized, serve as a reference and training tool, and assure proper vaccine management. SOPs should be maintained near vaccine storage units where staff can find them. Additionally, well -trained staff are necessary for implementing SOPs at the facility. Staff should be trained on storage and handlin g procedures as part of new employee orientation, annually, whenever new vaccines are added to the inventory, and whenever storage and handling recommendations change. A template Routine and Emergency Vaccine Management Plan (REVMP) may be found in Appendix A. At a minimum, SOPs should contain plans and information for three major areas: 1) General: contact information for vaccine manufacturers, equipment service providers, and important facility staff; job descriptions; regularl y used forms; and staff training requirements 2) Vaccine inventory management: ordering vaccines, monitoring storage, etc. 3) Emergency: steps to take in the event of equipment malfunctions, power failures, or other emergencies that can compromise storage conditions A primary vaccine coordinator must be designated for ensuring all vaccines are stored and handled correctly. A back -up vaccine coordinator must also be appointed to act in the absence of the primary coordinator. Both coordinators are responsible for: Ordering vaccine (once available) and overseeing receipt/storage of deliveries Maintaining all documentation, such as vaccine inventory and temperature logs The Tennessee Department of Health are not authorized to assess, validate, verify, or endorse products or services of private companies. When purchasing storage and handling equipment, keep in mind that products labeled as \"CDC -compliant\" have not been reviewed by the CDC or the Tennessee Department of Health. Always contact the Tennessee Vaccine -Preventable Diseases and Immunization Program if you are unsure if a specific product meets requirements. 5 Monitoring operation of vaccine storage equipment and systems Organizing vaccines in storage units, including rotating stock at least weekly so vaccines with earlier expiration dates are used first and removing expired vaccines Monitoring temperature data on storage units, including: o Setting up temperature monitoring devices (TMDs) o Checking minimum/maximum temperatures for the last 24 hours in the morning and checking current temperatures in the morning and afternoon o Reviewing temperature data weekly for shifts in temperature trends o Responding to and reporting temperature excursions Organizing vaccine -related training and ensuring staff complete training Overseeing vaccine transport when necessary Overseeing emergency procedures, such as tracking inclement weather conditions and ensuring appropriate handling of vaccines during a disaster or power outage VPDIP requires completion of CDC's COVID -19 Vaccine Training Modules for all primary and back -up coordinators at all sites enrolled in the COVID -19 Vaccination Program. Pharmacists signing the Storage and Handling portion of the COVID -19 Provider Agreement are also required to complete the training modules. Continuing Education Units (CEUs) are available upon completion of each module and must be provided to VPDIP for review. Current training modules are listed below and may be found on CDC's COVID -19 Vaccine Training Modules Homepage . COVID -19 Vaccine Train ing: General Overview of Immunization Best Practices for Healthcare Providers Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine (Johnson & Johnson): What Healthcare Professionals Need to Know Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine: What Healthcare Professionals Need to Know Pfizer -BioNTech COVI D-19 Vaccine: What Healthcare Professionals Need to Know Section Three: Equipment Vaccine Storage Unit Recommendations Purpose -built or pharmaceutical grade units are designed specifically for storing biologics such as vaccines. These units: Can be compact, under -the-counter style or large Often have microprocessor -based temperature control with a digital temperature sensor (thermocouple, resistant temperature detector [RTD], or thermistor) Often have fan -forced air circulation with powerful fans or multiple cool air vents 6 promoting uniform temperature and fast temperature recovery from an out -of- range temperature Household grade units can be an acceptable alternative under the right conditions. When using these units, the freezer compartment of a combination unit is not allowed to store vaccines , and certain areas of the refrigerated compartment should be avoided as well. Separate standalone freezers are necessary for storing frozen vaccine. If a manual defrost freezer is used, an appropriate back -up freezer must be available to store vaccine in when the main freezer is being defrosted. A defrost plan should be included in the storage and handling SOPs, and the unit should be defrosted when the unit has accumulated to a thickness of approximately 1 cm. Dormitory -style and bar -style units may never be used to store vaccine. These units have a single external door and evaporator plate (cooling coil) that is usually located in the \"freezer\" within the refrigerator. These units place vaccine at high risk of freezing. Storage Unit Placement Vaccine temperature stability requires air circulation around the outside of the storage unit. Recommendations for where to place refrigerators and freezers include: Unit should be in well -ventilated room with stand ard room temperatures (between 20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C [68\u00b0F and 77\u00b0F]) and space between the unit, ceiling, and walls Nothing should block the cover of the motor compartment Unit should be firm and level, with bottom of unit above floor Door should be able to open and close smoothly and fit squarely against unit body Stabilizing Temperatures in New and Repaired Units Prior to storing vaccines in a new or repaired unit, check and record the minimum and maximum temperatures each workday for two to seven days. Once you have two consecutive days of temperatures within the recommended range, the unit is stable and can be used for vaccine storage once approved by VPDIP . Recommended Temperature Ranges Differen t COVID -19 vaccines have different recommended temperature ranges. Refrigerated vaccines should be stored in refrigerators maintained at temperatures between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C. Frozen vaccines should be stored in freezers maintained at temperatures between -25\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C. Ultra -cold vaccines should be stored in freezers or dry ice shipping container in which product is received between -95\u00b0C and -60\u00b0C. 7 Temperature Monitoring Devices (TMD) All storage units must be equipped with a speci fic type of TMD known as a digital data logger (DDL). DDLs provide details on all temperatures the unit has reached at preset intervals. DDLs should have the following features: Detachable, buffered probe (or digitally buffered device that mimics buffered probe) Alarms (audible or visual) for out-of-range temperatures, with parameters set as: o Refrigerator low alarm (too cold) set to trigger after 15 consecutive minutes or longer below 2.0\u00b0C o Refrigerator high alarm (too warm) set to trigger after 60 consecutive minutes or longer above 8.0\u00b0C o Freezer high alarm (too warm) set to trigger after 60 consecutive minutes or longer above -15\u00b0C Low-battery indicator Active display outside of unit that allows current, minimum, and maximum temperatures to be monitored without opening unit door Recommended uncertainty of +/- 0.5\u00b0C Logging interval (or reading rate) that can be programmed by the user to measure and record temperatures at least every 30 minutes Ability to easily download data for review Ability to report temperatures in Celsius A current and valid Certificate of Calibration A back -up DDL with a valid and current Certificate of Calibration must also be available on -site and readily available in case a primary DDL malfunctions or requires re - calibration. The back -up DDL should be stored outside of the storage unit until needed, and it should have a different calibration re -testing date than the primary DDLs so that one may be used while the other is being replaced or sent out for re-calibration. Certificate of Calibration Testing Calibration testing ensures the accuracy of DDLs against nationally accepted standards. Calibration testing should be done every one or two years or according to the manufacturer's suggested timeline. Certificates of Calibration testing should indicate one or more of the following about the testing: Conforms to International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 17025 international standards for calibration testing and traceability Performed by a laboratory accredited by International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) Manual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) signatory body 8 Traceable to standards maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Meets specifications and testing requirements for the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard E2877 Tolerance Class F or higher Refers to another acceptable accuracy validation method, such as comparison to other traceable reference standards or tests at thermometric fixed points Certificates of Calibration Testing should also include: Model/device name or number Serial number Date of calibration (report or issue date) Confirmation that the instrument passed testing (or instrument is in tolerance) Recommended uncertainty of +/- 0.5\u00b0C (+/ - 1\u00b0F) or less The following TMDs should not be used Alcohol or mercury thermometers Bimetal stem TMDs TMDs used for food Chart recorded Infrared TMDs TMDs that do not have a current and valid Certificate of Calibration testing Temperature Probe Placement The DDL probe should be placed in the middle area of the storage unit with the vaccines. Anchoring the probe will prevent it from being moved. It should not be placed in the doors, near or against the walls, close to vents, or on the floor of the unit as temperatures in these locations may differ significantly from the temperature in the zone where vaccine is stored. Monitoring Vaccine Temperature and Equipment Daily Checks Current temperatures should be reviewed for each storage unit twice a day (once in the morning and once in the afternoon). During the morning temperature check, the minimum and maximum temperature for the past 24 hours should also be reviewed. If your DDL can record twice daily readings, use this function and document readings on the Vaccine Storage Unit Digital Data Logger Sign -off Sheet . If your DDL can document the initials of the person that completes the reading, the sign -off sheet does not need to be comple ted. If your DDL cannot document readings on the DDL report at all, use the 9 Refrigerator and Freezer Temperature Logs to document checks. Weekly Checks Additionally, DDL reports must be printed, reviewed, and signed by the Vaccine Coordinator each week and maintained with temperature logs for three years. Power Supply The following precautions must be taken to protect the unit's power supply: Plug in only one unit per electrical outlet to avoid creating a fire hazard or triggering a safety switch that turns the power off Use a safety -lock plug or an outlet cover to prevent the unit from being unplugged Post \"DO NOT UNPLUG \" signs at outlets and on units Post \"DO NOT TURN OFF\" signs on fuses and circuit breakers Use caution when using power outlets that can be tripped or switched off and avoid using built -in circuit switches which may have reset buttons, outlets that can be activated by a wall switch, and multi -outlet power strips o If built -in current switches or power strip surge protection must be used, make sure the power strip is rated to carry the maximum current as specified by the manu facturer of the refrigerator or freezer. Organizing and Storing Vaccine Store vaccines in their original packaging with lids closed until ready for administration. Loose vials or syringes may be exposed to unnecessary light and may be more difficult to tra ck for expiration dates. Not storing vaccines in the original packaging affects inventory management and increases the risk of administration errors. Best practices for correct storage of vaccines within a refrigerator or freezer include: Store each type of vaccine/diluent in original packaging and in a separate container Position vaccines/diluents 2-3 inches from unit walls, ceilings, floor, and door. o If using a household -grade unit, do not store vaccines/diluents directly under cooling vents; in del i, fruit, or vegetable drawers; or on refrigerator door shelves. These areas may expose vaccines to unstable temperatures and insufficient air flow. Label shelves/containers to identify where each type of vaccine/diluent is stored. Store vaccines/diluents with similar packaging/names or with pediatric/adult formulations on different shelves. Store diluents with the corresponding refrigerated vaccine. Never store diluent in a freezer. Avoid placing or storing any items other than vaccines, diluents, and water bottles inside storage units. 10 o If other medications and biological products must be stored in the same unit as vaccines, they must be clearly marked and stored in separate containers or bins from vaccine. o Potentially contaminated items ( e.g., blood, urine, stool) should be properly contained and stored below vaccines due to risk of contamination from drips or leaks. o The freezer of a combination household -grade unit may be used for non - vaccine, medical storage, as long as the use does not compromise the temperature range within the refrigerator compartment where vaccine is stored. Arrange vaccines/diluents in rows and allow space between them to promote air circulation. Place vaccines/diluents with the earliest expiration dates in front of those with later expiration dates. Place water bottles on the top shelf, floor, and in the door racks. Putting water bottles help maintain stable temperatures caused by frequently opening and closing unit doors or a power failure. o Water b ottles are not recommended for use with certain pharmaceutical - grade and purpose -built units. For such units, follow the manufacturer's guidance. Regular Maintenance of Equipment Vaccine storage units and DDLs require regular maintenance to ensure proper operation. On a regular basis, check seals and door hinges, clean coils and other compartments per manufacturer direction, defrost manual -defrost freezers when the frost exceeds either 1cm or the manufacturer's suggested limit (when defrosting, stor e vaccines temporarily in another unit with appropriate freezer temperatures), clean the interior of each unit to discourage bacterial and fungal growth, and test any back -up generator quarterly and have it served annually. Section Four: Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine Storage Using an Ultra -cold Freezer for Vaccine Storage Vaccine that is stored in an ultra -cold freezer should be stored between -80\u00b0C and -60\u00b0C ( - 112\u00b0F to -76\u00b0F). Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine may be stored in ultra -cold freezers until the expiration date. Storage of the vials between -96\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C ( -141\u00b0F to -76\u00b0F) is not considered an excursion from the recommended storage condition. Undiluted vials may be sto red at room temperature for no more than 2 hours. After dilution, store vials 11 between 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (35\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F) and use within 6 hours from the time of dilution. Vaccine vials should be protected from light and kept in the original packaging. Vials should always remain upright in trays during storage. If a vial is touched, it is considered \"thawed\" and is to be moved to the refrigerator for use within 5 days. If the lid of the vial tray is opened, it must be returned to ultra -cold storage within thre e (3) minutes and must stay in ultra -cold storage for two (2) hours before the tray is opened again. When transferring between ultra -cold environments, the 195 -vial box may be at room temperature for up to five (5) minutes if the lid is closed and intact. Vaccine stored in ultra -cold freezers must be continuously monitored by a DDL with a current, valid Certificate of Calibration. It is required that temperatures are reviewed for each vaccine storage unit twice each day (morning and afternoon) and that the minimum and maximum temperatures for the past 24 hours are reviewed each morning. These temperature readings must be documented daily, as should actions that are taken if the temperature readings are out of acceptable range. Providers may use the Vaccine Storage Unit Digital Data Logger Sign -off Sheet to record daily min/max temperatures, actions take n, and responsible staff initials. DDL reports must be printed, reviewed, and signed by the Primary or Back -up Vaccine Coordinators each week and maintained with temperature logs for three years. Using a Freezer for Vaccine Storage Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine that is stored in a freezer should be stored between -25\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C ( -13\u00b0F to 5\u00b0F). Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine may be stored in a freezer for up to two (2) weeks. NOTE: Vaccine should never be placed into the freezer compartment of a combination refrigerator/freezer unit. Vaccine stored at frozen temperatures must be stored in a separate, approved standalone freezer. Undiluted vials may be stored at room temperature for no more than 2 hours. After dilution, store vials between 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (35\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F) and use within 6 hours from the time of dilution. Frozen vials stored or transported at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C ( -13\u00b0F to 5\u00b0F) may be returned one time to the recommended storage condition of -80\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C ( -112\u00b0F to -76\u00b0F). This includes vials that are held up to two weeks at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C ( -13\u00b0F to 5\u00b0F), and at risk of not being used in time. Any time that the vials are stored or transported at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C count against the two -week limit. Total cumulative time the vials are stored at -25oC to -15oC should be tracked and should not exceed two weeks. CDC is updating Pfizer Beyond -Use Date Labels to track this two -week timeframe. Vaccine stored in freezers must be continuously monitored by a DDL with a current, valid Certificate of Calibr ation. It is required that temperatures are reviewed for each vaccine 12 storage unit twice each day (morning and afternoon) and that the minimum and maximum temperatures for the past 24 hours are reviewed each morning. These temperature readings must be documented daily, as should actions that are taken if the temperature readings are out of acceptable range. Providers may use the Vaccine Storage Unit Digital Data Logger Sign -off Sheet to record daily min/max temperatures, actions taken, and responsible staff initials. DDL reports must be printed, reviewed, and signed by the Primary or Back -up Vaccine Coordinators each week and maintained with temperature logs for three years. Using a Refrigerator for Vaccine Storage Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine that is stored in a refrigerator should be stored between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (35\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F). Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine may be stored in a refrigerator for up to 1 month (31 days) ; Pediatric vials (orange top) can be stored for 10 weeks. Undiluted vials may be stored at room temperature for no more than 2 hours. After dilution, store vials between 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (35\u00b0 F to 77\u00b0F) and use within 6 hours from the time of dilution ; pediatric doses are good for 12 hours after dilution. Vaccine stored in refrigerators must be continuously monitored by a DDL with a current, valid Certificate of Calibr ation. It is required that temperatures are reviewed for each vaccine storage unit twice each day (morning and afternoon) and that the minimum and maximum temperatures for the past 24 hours are reviewed each morning. These temperature readings must be docu mented daily, as should actions that are taken if the temperature readings are out of acceptable range. Providers may use the Vaccine Storage Unit Digital Data Logger Sign -off Sheet to record daily min/max temperatures, actions taken, and responsible staff initials. DDL reports must be printed, reviewed, and signed by the Primary or Back -up Vaccine Co ordinators each week and maintained with temperature logs for three years. Pfizer Pediatric doses , 5 through 11 years of age (orange top vials), are not stored in the freezer. These vials can only be stored in an ultra -cold freezer until the expiration date or in the refrigerator for 10 weeks. Please Note: Storing Pfizer vaccine in the shipping container is no longer supported by VPDIP. 13 Section Five: Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine Storage Using a Freezer for Vaccine Storage Moderna COVID -19 vaccine that is stored in a freezer should be stored between -50\u00b0C and - 15\u00b0C (-58\u00b0F to 5\u00b0F). Moderna COVID -19 vaccine may be stored in a freezer for up to six (6) months, until the expiration date . The expiration date is N OT printed on the vaccine vial or carton. To determine the expiration date: Scan the QR code located on the outer carton, or Go to www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine -eua/ NOTE: Vaccine should never be placed into the freezer compartment of a combination refrigerator/freezer unit. Vaccine stored at frozen temperatures must be stored in a separate, approved standalone freezer. After the first dose has been withdrawn , the vial should be held between 2\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F). Vials should be discarded 12 hours after the first puncture. Vaccine stored in freezers must be continuously monitored by a DDL with a current, valid Certif icate of Calibration. It is required that temperatures are reviewed for each vaccine storage unit twice each day (morning and afternoon) and that the minimum and maximum temperatures for the past 24 hours are reviewed each morning. These temperature readin gs must be documented daily, as should actions that are taken if the temperature readings are out of acceptable range. Providers may use the Vaccine Storage Unit Digital Data Logger Sign -off Sheet to record daily min/max temperatures, actions taken, and responsible staff initials. DDL reports must be printed, reviewed, and signed by the Primary or Back -up Vaccine Coordinators each week and maintained with temperature logs for three years. Using a Refrigerator for Vaccine Storage Moderna COVID -19 vaccine that is stored in a refrigerator should be stored between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (35\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F). Moderna COVID -19 vaccine may be stored in a refrigerator for up to thirty (30) days . After the first dose has been withdrawn, the vial should be held between 2\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F). Vials should be discarded 12 hours after the first puncture. Vaccine sto red in refrigerators must be continuously monitored by a DDL with a current, valid Certificate of Calibration. It is required that temperatures are reviewed for each vaccine storage unit twice each day (morning and afternoon) and that the minimum and maxim um temperatures for the past 24 hours are reviewed each morning. These temperature readings must be documented daily, as should actions that are taken if the temperature readings are out of acceptable range. 14 Providers may use the Vaccine Storage Unit Digital Data Logger Sign -off Sheet to record daily min/max temperatures, actions taken, and responsibl e staff initials. DDL reports must be printed, reviewed, and signed by the Primary or Back -up Vaccine Coordinators each week and maintained with temperature logs for three years. Section Six: Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine Using a Refrigerator for Vaccine Storage Janssen COVID -19 vaccine that is stored in a refrigerator should be stored between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (35\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F). Do not store Janssen COVID -19 vaccine in a freezer or ultra -cold freezer. Janssen COVID -19 vaccine may be stored in a refrigerator until the expiration date. The expiration date is NOT printed on the vaccine vial or carton. To determine the expiration date: Scan the QR code located on the outer carton, or Call 1 -800-565-4008 Go to www.vaxcheck.jnj. The Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine is initially stored frozen by the manufacturer, then shipped at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F). If vaccine is still frozen upon receipt, thaw at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F). If needed immediately, thaw at room temperature (maximally 25\u00b0C/77\u00b0F). At room temperature (maximally 25\u00b0C/77\u00b0F), a carton of 10 vials will take approximately 2 hours to thaw, and an individual vial will take approximately 1 hour to thaw. Do not refreeze once thawed. After the first dose has been withdrawn, hold the vial between 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) for up to 6 hours or at room temperature (maximally 25\u00b0C/77\u00b0F) for up to 2 hours. Vaccine stored in refrigerators must be continuously monitored by a DDL with a current, valid Certificate of Ca libration. It is required that temperatures are reviewed for each vaccine storage unit twice each day (morning and afternoon) and that the minimum and maximum temperatures for the past 24 hours are reviewed each morning. These temperature readings must be documented daily, as should actions that are taken if the temperature readings are out of acceptable range. Providers may use the Vaccine Storage Unit Digital Data Logger Sign -off Sheet to record daily min/max temperatures, actio ns taken, and responsible staff initials. DDL reports must be printed, reviewed, and signed by the Primary or Back -up Vaccine Coordinators each week and maintained with temperature logs for three years. 15 Section Seven: Temperature Excursions (TEs) Tempera ture excursions (TEs) occur when there is a temperature reading outside of the recommended temperature range for a vaccine. When a TE occurs, VPDIP must be notified as quickly as possible at 800 -404-3006 during business hours or the next business morning (Monday - Friday, 8:00 AM - 4:30 PM CT) and before any vaccine is administered. If a TE occurs, follow these steps : 1. Troubleshoot to see if you can identify why unit went out -of-range (e.g., unit is unplugged, unit door is open or not sealed adequately, thermostat is set incorrectly, probe has been moved from center of unit, or coils and vents have excess dust) and attempt to return vaccine to proper storage conditions if still out-of-range by. a. If outside of business hours and temperature is still out -of-range and cannot be restored to proper temperatures, execute emergency plan. 2. Label vaccines \"Do not use until notified by VPDIP,\" and do not use until approved. 3. Call VPDIP for further instruction. 4. Download DDL report, noting how long the temperature has been out of range and the minimum/maximum temperatures. 5. Send the DDL report/temperature log by fax to (615) 401 -6829 or by email to Temperature.Health@tn.gov . Include facility PIN and name on report. 6. Wait for notification from VPDIP whether the vaccine can be used. Section Eight: Vaccine Inventory Management The vaccine cold chain becomes the provider's responsibility once delivery is made to the facility. The following section provides information on ensuring that vaccines are unpacked, stored, prepared, administere d, and transported correctly. Refrigerated vaccines reach temperatures colder than 2\u00b0C or warmer than 8\u00b0C Frozen vaccines reach temperatures colder than -25\u00b0 or warmer than -15\u00b0C Ultra -cold vaccines reach temperatures colder than -95\u00b0C or warmer than -60\u00b0C TE is part of a pattern of frequent excursions, regardless of duration TE concerns regardless of one of the above criteria 16 Scheduling and Receiving Deliveries Staff members who may accept deliveries should be trained to immediately notify the vaccine coordinator or other designated personnel when deliveries arrive. Unpacking Deliveries Vaccines an d diluents must be carefully unpacked, stored at recommended temperatures, and documented immediately after arrival. Check the shipment to ensure: No damage occurred to the package during transport The correct types and quantities of vaccines (and diluents, if applicable) No expired or soon -to-expire products were shipped No TEs occurred during transit (using the cold chain monitor [CCM]) Unopened/unpacked boxes should not be placed in a storage unit because the cool packs shipped with the vaccine can make the vaccine too cold if placed inside the storage unit. Ultra -cold vaccine may be shipped in coolers packed in dry ice. These coolers should be repacked with dry ice within 24 hours of receipt and repacked again within 5 days or per manufa cturer recommendations. Stock Rotation and Removal On a regular basis, vaccine stock should be rotated and checked for expired doses. Expired vaccines and diluents should be removed immediately to avoid inadvertent administration. Vaccines with earlier exp iration dates should be placed in front of those with later expiration dates. Preparing Vaccines for Administration Preparing vaccines is the final step in the cold chain before administering to the patient. Best practices for handling vaccines include: Prepare vaccines in a designated area away from any space where potentially contaminated items are placed. Only prepare vaccines when you are ready to administer them. Check expiration dates and confirm that you have selected the correct vaccine. Only administer vaccines you have prepared. Section Nine: Vaccine Transport Vaccine Transport to Offsite PODs or Mobile Clinics Vaccines should never be transported to an offsite clinic, POD, or mobile clinic 17 without written approval from the VPDIP Program . It is imperative that your facility has the appropriate equipment and processes in place to ensure the vaccine cold chain is maintained before, during, and after transport. Please contact Vaccine.St orage@tn.gov if your facility intends to conduct mobile or offsite clinics. A vaccine storage and handling expert will evaluate your proposed equipment and protocols to ensure vaccine can be safely transported offsite. Required equipment includes a portable plug -in vaccine refrigerator and/or freezer and approved DDLs with valid Certificates of Calibration. Written protocols for vaccine transport will also be required. Emergency Vaccine Transport Vaccines should not be routinely transported. However, emergencies such as storage unit failure or power outage may require vaccine transport; in these instances, ensure precautions are taken to protect your supply by using the appropriate packing materials and procedures. CDC's Packing Vaccines for Transport during Emergencies is a useful tool that details proper procedures for doing so. Highlights include: Diluents should be included with their corresponding vaccines during transport to ensure there is always an adequate amount for reconstitution. o If diluents typically stored at room temperature (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C [68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F]) will be transported with refrigera ted vaccines, they should be refrigerated in advance for as long as possible, so they do not raise the container temperature when placed with refrigerated vaccines. Diluents should never be frozen, even during transport. When packing vaccines and diluents for transport, place an insulating barrier like bubble wrap between the diluents and conditioned water bottles or phase change materials. Maintain a sufficient supply of materials needed for emergency vaccine transport of your maximum inventory. Materials include: o Portable vaccine refrigerators/freezer units (preferred) o Qualified containers and packouts o Hard -sided insulated containers or Styrofoam o Coolant materials such as phase change materials (PCMs) or frozen water bottles that can be conditioned to 4\u00b0C to 5\u00b0C Follow manufacturer's instructions for use to reduce the risk of freezing vaccines during transport o Insulation materials such as bubble wrap and corrugated cardboard - enough to form two layers per container o DDLs for each containe r Soft-sided containers specifically engineered for vaccine transport are acceptable. Do not use commercially available soft -sided food or beverage coolers because most are poorly 18 insulated and likely to be affected by room or outdoor temperatures. In an e mergency situation, a system with conditioned water bottles can be used. Never use commercially available soft -sided food or beverage coolers, and only use the original shipping materials that vaccines were initially shipping on or conditioned water bottle transport systems as a last resort in emergencies. In no situation should the frozen gel packs or coolant packs from the original shipments be re-used. Planning and Preparing for Transport Emergency vaccine packing and transport protocols should be included within your facility's SOPs to ensure you are prepared for a situation in which your vaccine supply must be transported. Staff should be trained to pack vaccines correctly. Prior to transport, take an inventory of vaccines and record actions to protect vaccines during transport. Use the COVID -19 vaccine Transport log in Appendix B to record the time vaccines are removed from the storage unit and placed in the transport container, the temperature during transport, and the time at the end of transport when vaccines are placed in a stable storage unit. When in transport, only open unit doors when necessary and only after all preparation for packing and moving vaccines has been completed. Avoid leaving containers where they may be exposed to direct sunlight. Check vaccine temperature upon arrival at the alternative vaccine storage facility and store vaccines at recommended temperatures immediately. Monitoring Temperatures During and After Transport While in transport, vaccines shoul d still be continuously monitored using a DDL. DDLs used in vaccine transport have the same requirements as the ones used during routine storage and handling. Upon arrival at the destination, vaccines should be immediately stored in a storage unit with a D DL. A DDL report from the DDL used in transport should be printed, reviewed for TEs, and maintained with COVID -19 vaccine records for three (3) years. Section Ten: Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Equipment failures, power outages, severe weather conditions, and natural disasters can happen without warning and may compromise vaccine storage conditions. In addition to vaccine transport planning, additional plans should be in place for emergencies. You may choose to have a backup storage unit within your facility where vaccine can be stored if the primary storage unit fails. Additionally, you may have a generator that is 1 Tennessee Vaccine -Preventable Diseases and Immunization Program 1 19 activated if power is compromised to the facility. However, even if a generator is availabl e, additional backup plans should be in place for transport out of the facility. Alternative Storage Facility A working agreement should be established with at least one alternative storage facility as part of emergency vaccine storage and handling planning. This agreement should include 24-hour access to this facility. After Hours Facility Access A relationship with your facility's building manager and/or security staff should be maintained to ensure that you are able to access your vaccine supply o utside of normal business hours. Relevant staff should maintain copies of information regarding building access and security procedures at home. 2 Tennessee Vaccine -Preventable Diseases and Immunization Program 1 Routine and Emergency Vaccine Management Plan (REVMP) KEEP YOUR MANAGEMENT PLAN NEAR VACCINE STORAGE UNITS The Tennessee Vaccine -Preventable Diseases and Immunization Program (VPDIP) requires COVID -19 Vaccination Program providers to maintain a vaccine management plan for routine and emergency situations.

Place frozen cold packs in standalone freezers for similar purposes. Identify alternate vaccine storage locations (e.g. a local hospital, a local health depart ment, or another COVID -19 provider). Ensure the location has adequate space to accommodate vaccines and that their temperature monitoringequipment meets requirements . Update necessary contact information for alternate vaccine storage locations, including facility name, address, contact person, and telephone number. Stock emergency supplies as indicated in CDC's Packing Vaccines for Transport during Emergencies Job Aid Label and keep accessible any necessary vaccine packing and transport supplies, copies of vaccine transport job aids, facility floor plans when available, and other related information Be familiar with back -up power sources for commercial, laboratory, and pharmacy -grade storage units During an Emergency: Assess the situation. Do not open the vaccine storage unit. Determine the cause of the power failure and estimate the time it will take to restore power. Notify key vaccine management staff listed on the Emergency Plan as appropriate If the power outage is expected to be short -term, usually restored within 2 hours: Record the time that the outage started, unit temperatures (current, minimum, and maximum) for each day,and the room temperature Place a \"DO NOT OPEN\" sign on the storage unit(s) to conserve cold air massMonitor The temperature until power is restored If the outage is expected to be long -term, usually longer than 4 hours, consider moving vaccines to an alternative unit or facility. See details below, under Relocating Vaccine. NOTE: Temperatures in vaccine storage units tend to increase faster during power outages. As a result, clinics may need to monitor temperature more frequently and/or transport vaccines to an alternate location sooner. 4 Tennessee Vaccine -Preventable Diseases and Immunization Program 14 Relocating Vaccine: If a power outage is expected to be long -term (e.g. not restored by the end of the day) or storage units are not working properly, prepare to relocate vaccines to alternate storage locations. If moving vaccines, a DDL must remain with the vaccine at all times . Before transporting vaccines: Review CDC's Packing Vaccines for Transport during Emergencies Job Aid Contact the alternate storage facility to verify that they can accept the vaccines If transport or relocation is not feasible (e.g. alternate location is not available or travel conditions are unsafe): Keep units closed and document the current, minimum, and maximum temperatures for each day Notify the VPDIP Team at 800-404-3006 or Temperature.Health@tn.gov Packaging and transporting vaccines: Complete the Refrigerated Vaccine Transport Log and/or the Freezer Vaccine Transport Log Attach DDL to cooler Prepare cooler(s) for transport following CDC's Packing Vaccines for Transport during Emergencies Job Aid Use frozen cold packs for frozen vaccines. Never use dry ice. Use conditioned (slightly defrosted) frozen packs for refrigerated vaccines. Placing refrigerated vaccine directly on frozen packs and packaging it without sufficient insulation may freeze and therefore, damage vaccine. If clinic does not have time to condition frozen packs, refrigerated cold packs or cold water bottles maybe used. Package and prepare diluent Diluents stored in the refrigerator should be transported with refrigerated vaccines Diluents stored at room temperature sh ould be transported at room temperature Diluents packaged with their vaccine should be transported with their vaccine Upon arrival at the alternate vaccine storage location, document total vaccine transport time, the current, minimum, and maximum temperatures in the transport cooler(s), and the current, minimum, and maximumtemperatures in the alternate storage unit(s). After Power is Restored: Verify storage units are functioning properly and temperatures are within range before attempting to move any vaccine Follow the same transportation procedures and transfer vaccine back to its original storage unit Vaccine kept at the proper temperature during the power outage, whether transported or not, may be used For any vaccine not stored at proper temperature: Segregate it in the storage unit Mark it \"Do Not Use Until Further Notice\" Contact the VPDIP Team at 800-404-3006 to report the excursion Never return vaccine to the vaccine distributor without authorization from VPDIP 5 Tennessee Vaccine -Preventable Diseases and Immunization Program 15 Acknowledgement and Signature Log Please sign and date this acknowledgement and signature log when you update practice -specific information.
