Suitable topics for update are identified through the new surveillance programme (see surveillance programme interim guide) . The surveillance programme when reviewing the Advanced Breast Cancer guideline identified new evide nce in relation to the role of exercise in people who have, or are at risk of, breast cancer related lymphoedema. The full surveillance review decision is available on the NICE w ebsite. These guidelines are updated using a standing committee of healthcare professionals and lay members from a range of disciplines and localities. For the duration of the update the core members of the committee are joined by up to five additional me mbers who are have specific expertise in the topic being updated, hereafter referred to as ' topic specific members'. In this document where 'the committee' is referred to, this means the entire committee, both the core standing members and topic specifi c members. Where 'standing committee members' is referred to, this means the core standing members of the committee only. Where ' topic specific members' is referred to this means the recruited group of members with topic specific expertise.

Clinical guideline 81.1 breast cancer (advanced) 6 1 Summary S ection Recommendations Discuss with people who have or who are at risk of breast -cancer related lymphoedema that there is no indication that exercise prevents, causes or worsens lymphoedema. Discuss with people who have or who are at risk of breast cancer related lymphoedema that exercise may improve their quality of life Research recommendation Assessment of the role of exercise : What is the role of arm and shoulder specific exercise s compared with and/or used as an adjunct to established lymphoedema treatments (such as compression garments and complex decongestive therapy) ? (These well-designed randomised controlled trials should consider differing arm and shoulder specific aerobic and/or resistive exercise s that focus on strength an d flexibility to improve local lymph flow , for example, swimming, weight lifting, tai chi and yoga . The studies should have a follow -up period that is sufficient to capture long term outcomes including changes to current lymphoedema or any new onset lympho edema in other part of the limb . Outcomes for this research should include quality of life measures. Update information This update guidance is an addendum to Advanced breast cancer (NICE clinical guideline 81; published February 2009 ). This update relate s to people with breast cancer related lymphoedema, the management of which is in the NICE guideline on advanced breast cancer. However this update also includes people at risk of developing breast -cancer related lymphoedema, the management of which is in Early and locally advanced breast cancer (NICE clinical guideline 80). This update guidance relates to both the NICE guideline on early and locally advanced breast cancer and the NICE guideline on advanced breast cancer. New recommendations relating to ex ercise and lymphoedema have been added for people with lymphoedema or people at risk of developing lymphoedema. . Patient -centred care This guideline offers best practice advice relating to exercise for patients who are at risk of or who have developed b reast cancer related lymphoedema. Patients and healthcare professionals have rights and responsibilities as set out in the NHS Constitution for England - all NICE guidance is written to reflect these. Treatment and care should take into account individua l needs and preferences. Patients should have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their care and treatment, in partnership with their healthcare professionals. If someone does not have the capacity to make decisions, healthcare professionals s hould follow the Department of Health's advice on consent, the Clinical guideline 81.1 breast cancer (advanced) 7 code of practice that accompanies the Mental Capacity Act and the supplementary code of practice on deprivation of liberty safeguards. In Wales, healthcare professionals should follow advice on consent from the Welsh Government. NICE has produced guidance on the components of good patient experience in adult NHS services. All healthcare professionals should follow the recommendations in Patient experience in adult NHS services (NICE clinical guid eline 138) . Methods Please see the interim process and methods guide for updates pilot programme 2013 and the guidelines manual 2012 , both of which have been followed in the development of this update . Clinical guide line 81.1 breast cancer (advanced) 8 2 Evidence Review and Recommendations Introduction The NICE su rveillance programme undertakes regular reviews of published guidelines . Surveillance of the NICE guideline on advanced breast cancer concluded that there was potentially new evidence considering the use of exercise in those with or at risk of br east cance r-related lymphoedema and that this warranted an update. The NICE guideline on e arly and locally advanced breast c ancer included the management of lymphoedema within the 'Complications of local treatment and menopausal symptoms' section. This evidence rev iew will be located as an addendum to the NICE guideline on advanced breast c ancer, but is also relevant to the population covered in the NICE guideline on early and locally advanced breast c ancer . 2.1 Review Question 2.1.1 Review Question In adults with breast ca ncer post -treatment (excepting ongoing hormone treatment), what is the role of exercise in relation to the saf ety of the exercise undertaken? 2.1.2 Evidence Review This review aimed to assess exercise in those at risk of or with breast -cancer related lymphoedem a. It considered whether exercise increases the risk of lymphoedema developing or exacerbates existing lymphoedema . Though this review aimed to investigate the potential harm from exercise, it also included data on any potential benefits of exercise if available . It did not distinguish this group either by stage of cancer at diagnosis or by the treatments (surgery/chemotherapy or radiotherapy) that had been undertaken. The search of the published literature for this question was designed to identify rand omised controlled trials (RCTs) , systematic reviews, non -randomised controlled trials and observational studies. Initially , the only exclusion on evidence type was applied to narrative reviews and case studies. If the evidence available within clinical tri als was considered sufficient then observational studies would not be included in this review. As this question had not been specifically included in the original guidelines , there was no date restriction applied to this search. In recognition of the diff iculties in defining differing exercise programmes, there was no initial restriction applied to the exercise being considered in the potentially included studies (i.e. any exercise with and without movement (such as carrying weights compared with swinging weights)). Studies that considered postoperative physiotherapy regimens were excluded (these are included in the NICE guideline on early and locally advanced breast cancer and this section was not considered by NICE surveillance to require an evidence upd ate). The searches returned 2278 h its. O f these , 14 studies were selected for inclusion. These were all RCTs and considered to represent a sufficient body of evidence . Observational studies were not included . For the review protocol, see appendix C. There are no agreed diagnostic tests and assessment methods for lymphoedema. It was not possible for the committee to agree criteria that could be used to consider whether the definitions used in the studies as markers of lymphoedema were appropriate. There fore where study participants were reported as having lymphoedema this was taken to mean that Clinical guideline 81.1 breast cancer (advanced) 9 they had met the criteria used in that particular study. This , alongside the variety of exercise interventions in the included studies , meant that combining study outcomes within a meta - analysis was not appropriate. Of the included studies there were 7 studies where all participants had l ymphoedema at study recruitment; 4 studies where no participants were considered to have lymphoedema at recruitment and 3 studie s with a mix of those with and without lymphoedema. The table below summarises the methods of determining lymphoedema, whether or not participants had lymphoedema at baseline and the exercise intervention used, in the included studies. Clinical guideline 81.1 breast cancer (advanced) 10 Reference Sample Lymphoedema criteria or methods of diagnosis Intervention Cormie, 2013 (n=62) All participants with lymphoedema 5% inter -limb discrepancy in volume or circumference at the point of greatest visible difference High load resistan ce exercise group, low load resistance exercise group compared with usual care group Hayes, 2009 (n=32) All participants with lymphoedema Volume difference of 200mL, impedance ratio >3SD above normative data Aerobic and resistance exercise group compa red with control group Hayes, 2011 (n=295) All participants with lymphoedema 10% interlimb discrepancy in volume or circumference at the point of greatest difference/obstruction of the anatomical architecture/pitting oedema; prior clinical diagnosis of lymphoedema Weight -lifting group compared with control group (offered intervention after a 12mth delay) Johansson, 2013 (n=29) All participants with lymphoedema Volume difference 5% Water -based exercise programme group compared with control group Kim, 2010 (n=40) All participants with lymphoedema >2cm circumference difference between affected and unaffected arm; diagnosed by lymphoscintigraphy Active resistive exercise with CDT group compared with CDT alone McKen zie and Kalda, 2003 (n=14) All par ticipants with lymphoedema >2cm, <8cm on 1 measurement point Resistance and strength training group compared with control group (later given the option of the exercise programme) Schmitz, 2009 (n=141) All participants with lymphoedema Difference in the volume or circumference between the aff ected and unaffected of 10% Weight -lifting treatment group compared with wait -list control group Anderson, 2012 (n=104) No participants initially with lymphoedema Not reported Aerobic and resistance exercise, lymphoedema prevention, patient and diet education compared with usual care group Kilbreath, 2012 (n=160) No participants initially with lymphoedema Interlimb difference of 10% or interlimb difference of 2cm in at two or more measures Resistive training and stretching exercises group compare d with control group Sagen, 2009 (n=204) No participants initially with lymphoedema 10% increase in volume difference No activity restriction group compared with activity restriction group Schmitz, 2010 (n=154) No participants initially with lymphoed ema Difference in the volume or circumference between the affected and unaffected of 10% Weight -lifting treatment group compared with wait -list control group Ahmed, 2006 (n=45) Mixed Self-report clinical diagnosis, self -report of symptoms of lymphoedema, by circumference measure difference >2cm Weight training group compared with non - intervention group Hayes, 2013 (n=194) Mixed L-Dex (lymphoedema index) 10 Aerobic and strength exercise groups compared with usual care group Speck, 2010 (n=141) Mixed Difference in the volume or circumference between the affected and unaffected of 10% Weight -lifting treatment group compared with wait -list control group Clinical guideline 81.1 breast cancer (advanced) 11 2.1.3 Health Economic Evidence A search of relevant health economic databases did not identify any papers that met the inclusion criteria for this question. This topic was not prioriti sed for economic modelling. 2.1.4 Evidence Statements One study that included restricting activity (including aerobic or other exercise and avoiding carrying items weighing more than 3kg), where no participants had lymphoedema at recruitment, found no evidenc e of a difference at two years in the development of lymphoedema between those who restricted activity and those who did not restrict activity (and also undertook resistance exercise). The quality of evidence was moderate. Studies where all participants ha d lymphoedema/had a mix of participants with and without lymphoedema found no evidence that resistance exercise, weight -lifting exercise or water - based exercise caused exacerbations of lymphoedema. The quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. Studies where no participants, at recruitment, were considered to have lymphoedema found no evidence that resistance exercise or weight lifting exercise caused lymphoedema. The quality of evidence ranged from moderate to low. 2.1.5 Evidence to Recommendations Relative value of different outcomes The committee discussed the safety aspects of exercise and considered in the context of the question of safety whether there was evidence that exercise either caused or exacerbated lymphoedema. Many of the included s tudies had outcomes relating to the development of or possible exacerbation of lymphoedema through measures such as arm volume or arm circumference measures. The committee discussed that while these are evidently pertinent outcomes , the quality of life out comes were also of substantial importance for patients either with or at risk of lymphoedema. As there are no current recommendations in the NICE guidelines on early and locally advanced and advanced breast cancer relating to exercise in those with lymphoe dema , the standing committee members sought information from its topic specialist members about the conventional and current advice given in practice. The topic specific members explained that there has been a historical concern that lymphoedema could be p recipitated or exacerbated by undertaking strenuous activities. T his concern applied both to exercise and also to activities of daily living. Anecdotally links had apparently been made between strenuous activities and lymphoedema. Therefore , the convention al advice ha s been to restrict strenuous exercise. The topic specific members were not aware of an evidence base that had been used to develop this advice. The publication of newer studies was causing this advice to be questioned. Alongside considering th e outcomes used in the included studies , the committee noted that with many of the included studies the follow -up period had not extended beyond the period of the intervention. Therefore , longer term benefits or harms of the interventions studied would not have been captured in the data reported. This is particularly Clinical guideline 81.1 breast cancer (advanced) 12 important for conditions like lymphoedema which can develop slowly and over an unpredictable time frame. The committee further noted that within the included studies , all the exercise program mes were of a gradua ted and progressive nature in terms of intensity and frequency. They discussed and agreed that this progressive and gradua ted approach could be appropriate to be used by people with or at risk of lymphoedema. The committee noted that this approach would also be used by anyone instigating a new exercise regimen. Based on current evidence, the committee felt it will not be appropriate to recommend a specific type of exercise (e.g. progressive and graduated exercise) until further research has confirmed its benefits and harms. The exercise programmes investigated used progressive and graduated approaches but there was substantial variety in the exercise programmes investigated. Trade -off between benefits and harms The committee noted t hat much of the evidence presented is not about avoiding exertion but about doing exercise. Among the included studies, only one did restrict activities of living . However within this particular study the intervention group did not restrict activities al one but also undert ook exercise , therefore the outcomes of this study could not be viewed as having restricted daily activities alone. The committee discussed the possible harms of undertaking exercise, notably with regard to the potential for exercise r elated injury. They also discussed that the anecdotal advice to restrict activity with the potentially affected arm , could have resulted in those receiving this advice not exercising and therefore not getting the overall benefits of exercise. They noted th at while adverse effects had not generally been well reported in the studies, where they had been reported they were not higher with participants who undertook exercise. Overall the committee agreed that the evidence does not show that exercise is harmful however, it does not show that there are specific benefits to exercise either. The committee concluded that with the evidence available they could not make recommendations that included lymphoedema related beneficial outcomes of exercise. The committee di scussed that where quality of life had been used as an outcome, there was limited evidence of improvement with the exercise interventions. The committee did note that the quality of life measures used in the included studies were generic and not specifical ly designed in relation to lymphoedema. Nonetheless the committee considered that this evidence did show improvement in quality of life and provided evidence in this clinically important area. Therefore the committee agreed a recommendation relating to qua lity of life. As previously, when discussing the overall evidence base relating to the types of exercise involved, the committee did not consider it appropriate to specify the types of exercise programmes. The committee considered that they had no evid ence that supported the conventional advice on restricting activities/exercise to prevent or reduce exacerbations of lymphoedema. The committee, while accepting the limitations to the evidence, agreed that they had sufficient evidence to make recommendatio ns. As there are no specific recommendations relating to this area in the current NICE Clinical guideline 81.1 breast cancer (advanced) 13 guidelines on early and locally advanced breast cancer and advanced breast cancer, no recommendations would need standing down. The committee discussed the ambiguity o f terms surrounding the descriptions of exercise, such as strenuous or non -strenuous and that these could be liable to individual interpretation unless clearly defined. They concluded that with the recommendations , it would be most appropriate to refer to exercise without qualifying the term further as the exercise interventions used within the included studies were too varied. The committee noted that with the evidence available they could make recommendations that there was no evidence that exercise prev ents, causes or worsens lymphoedema. The committee discussed how the previous advice given to patients about exercise could affect their activities of daily living. Hence, t he committee wanted to highlight and further discuss one particular included study that r estricted activity in line with the previous advice given ( Sagen , 2009). The committee agreed that outcomes from this particular study warrant a separate evidence statement . In the absence of evidence , recommendations could not be made relating t o activities of daily living. Nonetheless the committee considered that the recommendation regarding exercise would implicitly include advice relating to activities of daily living. Quality of evidence The committee discussed that outcomes such as chang es in arm volume (or other measures of lymphoedema), quality of life measures, pain and cellulitis were important in this review. The committee also noted that making clear comparisons between studies was d ifficult. There are no accepted criteria used to d iagnose lymphoedema and the criteria and measures used between studies varied. Furthermore, the exercise interventions varied in type of exercise (aerobic, resistance, water -based) and in the intensity, frequency and duration of the intervention. Conseque ntly the committee agreed that , with the nature of the evidence identified , any pooling of the study outcomes across studies would be inapprop riate. Other considerations The committee discussed the unpredictable nature of lymphoedema development both i n terms of whether it develops and the time frame that this can involve. (The standing committee members received advice from the topic specific members that while there may be some linkage with the stage of breast cancer and the number of nodes removed, t his is not a clear, direct link). The committee therefore noted the need for future research studies being designed with appropriate follow -up periods and considered it to be important that this was reflected in research recommendations. 2.1.6 Recommendatio ns Discuss with people who have or who are at risk of breast -cancer related lymphoedema that there is no indication that exercise prevents, causes or worsens lymphoedema. Clinical guideline 81.1 breast cancer (advanced) 14 Discuss with people who have or who are at risk of breast cancer related lymphoedema that exercise may improve their quality of life 2.1.7 Research Recommendation Asse ssment of the role of exercise: What is the role of exercise compared with and/or used as an adjunct to established breast cancer related lymphoedema treatments (such as compres sion garments and complex decongestive therapy)? These well -designed randomised controlled trials should consider differing aerobic and/or resistive exercise; have a follow -up period ( possibly >2 years ) that is sufficient to capture long term outcomes including later onset lymphoedema. Outcomes for this research should i nclude quality of life measures. Why is this important? Historically people with or who are at risk of breast cancer related lymphoedema were advised to be cautious with t he affected/potentially affected arm, to avoid strenuous exercise, carrying heavy weights or strenuous activities of daily living. The review undertaken in this update addendum t o the NICE guideline on advanced breast cancer has reviewed evidence relating to exercise and people who have or who are at risk of developing breast cancer related lymphoedema. From this review it is clear that there is a lack of evidence, notably in regard to studies that incorporate sufficient follow -up time and /or patient focuse d outcomes such as quality of life. This evidence review also showed considerable variety in the types of exercise programmes used; therefore clear definition of the type of exercise in any future study is important.

Not including exercise as part of supervised physiotherapy treatment (CDT is decongestive lymphatic therapy used as a treatment for lymphoedema. It includes manual lymphatic drainage, multilayer lymphoedema bandaging, remedial exercise s and skin care. Can also be known as CPT (complex physical therapy). Objectives To consider the safety of exercise following treatment To consider the safety of exercise in those with breast cancer related lymphoedema Historically the advice has been to avoid strenuous exercise as this may increase the risk of swelling and/or pain, it is now questioned as to whether this may now actually be beneficial though there are risk/benefit questions Type of review Intervention Language English Study desi gn RCTs, controlled trials, systematic reviews If there is insufficient evidence found, observational studies will be considered Insufficient evidence is considered to be an evidence base that does not allow the RU committee to make recommendations or rese arch recommendations Status Published papers (full text only) Population Adults with breast cancer following treatment Specified subgroup; those with breast cancer related lymphoedema The initial protocols included ; - who have completed their primary cancer treatment and have no known local regional disease - and local regional recurrent disease The RU will not make this distinction and will include adults with breast cancer following treatment Intervention Differing exercise programmes, including e xercise with and without movement (such as carrying weights compared with swinging weights) Exercise as an adjunct to other lymphoedema treatment Will detail the exercise programmes/descriptions used within the included studies as it is anticipated that it will be difficult to define phrases such as 'strenuous exercise'. Some definition may be available for resistive exercise; this will become clearer following the review of the evidence. This may allow the RU committee to make recommendations or researc h recommendations in relation to these specific exercise programmes/descriptions (The potential exercise programmes for inclusion were those that Clinical guideline 81.1 b reast cancer (advanced) 26 could reasonably be expected to be completed at gyms or similar areas or at home, any that required equipmen t that would not be readily available were excluded) Comparator Differing exercise regimens (not including exercise as part of CDT) Not including post -surgical physiotherapy treatment Outcomes Outcomes: Important outcomes: - changes in limb volume - pain - changes in function (mobility/range of movement) - incidence of cellulitis - quality of life (including; psychosocial tools, changes in body image , changes in depression/anxiety) Additional outcomes: - prevention of further oedema - changes in activities of livin g and/or time off work - changes in skin condition - changes in related infections Other criteria for inclusion / exclusion of studies Include Adults with breast cancer, post -treatment Adults with breast cancer related lymphoedema Exclude Lymphoedema attri buted to causes other than breast cancer Narrative reviews, case studies Search strategies RCTs, systematic reviews, non -randomised controlled trials , observational studies Review strategies The NICE methodology checklists will be used as a guide to appraise the quality of individual studies Data on all included studies will be extracted into evidence tables Where statistically possible, a meta -analytical approach will be used to give an overall summary effect All key outcomes from evidence will be p resented in GRADE profiles or modified profiles and further summarized in evidence statements Clinical guideline 81.1 breast cancer (advanced) 27 Appendix D: Search strategy Database: Medline and Medline in Process Strategy used: Database: to Week adj milk).tw.

Aim: To investigate the differences between the effects of complex decongestive therapy (CDT) with and without active resistive exercise for the treatment of patients with breast cancer -related lymphedema. Number and charact eristics of patients 40 patients were consecutive ly selected by a physician from the outpatient clinic based on the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria: Patients who had a greater than 2 -cm circumference difference between the af fected arm and th e normal arm Patients who had lymphedema diagnosed via lymphoscintigraphy (decreased uptake or no uptake by the lymph nodes, dermal backflow, poor to no visualization of the collateral and main lymphatics, and decreased or no clearance of radioisotope from the injection site). Exclusion criteria: Patients who were older than 70 years Patients who had cancer recurrence within 6 months from the time of entering this study Patients who had lymphedema in both arms Patients who had vascular dise ase Patients who had any neurologic signs, such as decreased motor power, sensory changes, or decreased deep tendon reflexes Patients who could not communicate. Patient characteristics (table reproduced from Kim et al. 2010): Data: mean with SD. Interve ntion Group 1: CDT with active resistive exercise (n=20) CDT: manual lymphatic drainage, compression therapy, and remedial exercise (assisted by physical therapist for the first 2 weeks, then continued self -administered CDPT for another 6 weeks. Active re sistive exercise: using dumbbells for 15 minutes while wearing a compression stocking or a multilayer bandage .

Outcomes measures and effect sizes Distal/proximal/total arm volume (cm3). QoL: Korean version of SF -36 version 2. Volume Changes Between Pretreatment and Posttreatment (reproduced from Kim et al. 2010) Changes in SF -36 Between Pretreatment and Posttreatment (reproduced from Kim et al. 2010) After 8 weeks of treatment, the ARE group showed a significantly reduced volume in the proximal arm, compared with that of the non-ARE group. However, there was no significant difference in volume reduction of the distal and total arms between the groups . Comparing the 2 groups, ARE group s howed significant improvements only in 'role physical ' and 'general health ', as compared with non-ARE group , but no significant difference between groups in other SF -36 domains. Authors' conclusion The study demonstrated that ARE reduced the volume of BCR L and helped to improve QOL. Therefore, cancer care professionals should recommend ARE with CDPT, along with BCRL treatment, for improvement in BCRL severity and QOL. A future large -scale study to further analyze the effects of ARE on BCRL is recommended. Source of Not reported.

Lymphedema was defined as a difference in the volume or circumference betwee n the affected and unaffected limb of 10% No differences in baseline between the groups for age (range 36 to75yrs) , education, race/ethnicity, occupation, mths since cancer diagnosis, cancer stage, no.of nodes removed, treatment, arm volume difference Intervention Intervention group (n=77): 1 -year weight -lifting treatment group - first 13 weeks, instructed x2/wk (groups 2 -6 participants ) at a community fitness centre, led by certified fitness professionals, 90 -min sessions - stretching, 10 min of cardiov ascular warm -up, 'core' exercises to strengthen abdominal and back muscles, and weight -lifting exercises - upper body; seated row, chest press, lateral or front raises, bicep curls, tricep pushdowns ; with free weights or resistance machines - lower body; l eg press, back extension, leg extension, leg curl; with resistance machines - 13 wks to 1ys, continued x2/wk unsupervised exercise Trainers asked about changes in symptoms wkly, mthly assessment of circumference and water volume measures. Any changes tre ated promptly Participants in both groups were required to attend a 1 -hour educational lecture that reviewed the National Lymphedema Network guidelines for risk reduction, treatment, and exercise. Comparator Control group 2 (n=77): wait -list control Control group participants were asked not to change their level of exercise during study participatio n.

81.1 breast cancer (advanced) 83 Appendix I: Research Recommendation 1. What is the role of arm and shoulder specific exercises compared with and/ or used as an adjunct to established lymphoedema treatments (such as compression garments and complex decongestive therapy ? Why this is important? Historically people with or who are at risk of breast cancer related lymphoedema were advised to be cautious with the affected/potentially affected arm, to avoid strenuous exercise, carrying heavy weights or strenuous activities of daily living. The review undertaken in this update addendum to the NICE guideline on advanced breast cancer has reviewed evidence relating to exercise in people who have or who are at risk of developing breast cancer related lymphoedema. From this review it is evident that there is a lack of evidence, notably in regard to evidence that incorporates sufficient follow -up time and patient focused outcomes such as quality of life. This evidence review also showed considerable variety in the types of exercise programmes used; therefore clear definition of the type of exercise in any future study is important. PICO question Population: People with breast cancer related lymphoedema considered to require treatment Intervention: Arm and shoulder specific a erobic and/or resistive exercises (that focused on strength and flexibility to improve local lymph flow ) either alone or as an adjunct t o existing treatment Comparison: Existing breast cancer related lymphoedema treatments (such as compression garments, or complex decongestive treatment (CDT)) Primary o utcomes: Quality of life measures, lymphoedema related outcomes (limb volume/circumfere nce, inter -limb differences, pain, changes in function) Importance to patients or the population The provision of clearer advice to patients regarding exercise (including types of exercise) and breast cancer related lymphoedema would assist patients with making exercise choices Study design RCT Other comments Examples for arm and shoulder specific a erobic and/or resistive exercises : swimming, weight lifting, tai chi and yoga.
