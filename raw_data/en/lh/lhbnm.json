We assessed the efficacy and safety of a rFVIIa 'megadose' (300 mg kg \u00c01 bolus) as treatment for bleeds in three young inhibitor patients. Of 114 bleeds, 95 responded to a single dose. Pain relief was faster and therapy duration significantly shorter than with continuous infusion (CI) regimens or standard boluses (90 mg kg \u00c01 every 3 h). Rebleeding occurred in 9.6% of cases and 19/114 episodes required a second bolus injection. Although rFVIIa consumption per bleed (median: 300 mg kg \u00c01 ) was higher than with standard boluses (180-270 mg kg \u00c01 ), patients found single bolus administration more convenient than recurrent injections or CI. With two exceptions, no complications occurred within 3 h of treatment, despite high FVII:C levels (median: 27.4 U mL \u00c01 ; range: 19.8-54 U mL \u00c01 ).

Background: Antibodies to glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa and/or HLA may render platelet transfusions ineffective to stop bleeding or to cover surgery in patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT). Anecdotal reports suggest recombinant factor (rF)VIIa might be a therapeutic alternative in these situations. Objectives: An international survey was conducted to evaluate further the efficacy and safety of rFVIIa in GT patients. Patients: We analyzed the use of rFVIIa during 34 surgical/invasive procedures and 108 bleeding episodes in 59 GT patients including 29 with current or previous antiplatelet antibodies, and 23 with a history of refractoriness to platelet transfusion. Results: rFVIIa was effective in 29 of the 31 evaluable procedures, and in 77 of the 103 evaluable bleeding episodes of which eight had a recurrence. A significantly higher success rate was observed in severe bleeding episodes when an arbitrarily defined 'optimal regimen' derived from the Canadian pilot study results ( 80 \u00b5g kg1 rFVIIa/injection, dosing interval 2.5 h, three or more doses before failure declaration) was used compared with other regimens (77%; 24/31 vs. 48%, 19/40; 2, P = 0.010). Patients given maintenance doses had significantly fewer recurrences within 48 h of bleed cessation compared with those not given any (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.022). One thromboembolic event and one blood clot in the ureter occurring in surgical patients following prolonged continuous infusion of high-dose rFVIIa and antifibrinolytic drug use have been previously reported. Conclusion: rFVIIa seems a potential alternative to platelet transfusion in GT patients, particularly in those with antiplatelet antibodies and/or platelet refractoriness. Haemophilia 2010 Summary. Recombinant activated factor VIIa (FVIIa) is a bypassing agent used to treat bleeding episodes in haemophilia patients with inhibitors to factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX. The pharmacological effect of FVIIa is short-lived and therefore with the recommended dose of 90 g kg1, a bleeding episode is treated with multiple injections. A long-acting form of FVIIa that can ensure adequate haemostasis with a single infusion, without increasing the thrombotic risk, would therefore be beneficial. PEGylated liposomes (PEGLip) have been shown to bind FVIIa and to improve haemostatic efficacy in preclinical experiments. In the present phase I/II clinical trial, we assessed the safety and efficacy of PEGLip-formulated FVIIa in severe haemophilia A patients (FVIII 1%) with inhibitors to FVIII. Each patient received one prophylactic infusion of standard FVIIa and one prophylactic infusion of PEGLip-formulated FVIIa. The order of the infusions was randomized and the two infusions were separated by a ten-day washout period. Efficacy assessed by thromboelastography revealed that PEGLip-FVIIa induced significantly shorter clotting times and produced higher clot firmnesses than standard FVIIa. Thrombin generation assays showed that PEGLip-FVIIa induced faster thrombin generation and higher peak levels of thrombin than standard FVIIa. These effects lasted up to 5 h postinfusion. Measurements of D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and fibrinogen showed no significant differences between the PEGLip-FVIIa and standard FVIIa treatments. PEGLip-FVIIa therefore showed improved haemostatic efficacy without increased risk of thrombosis and may be further developed for the treatment for bleeding episodes in haemophilia patients with inhibitors.
