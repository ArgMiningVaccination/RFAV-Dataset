The resulting product gas is a versatile energy carrier, which offers a range of benefits. Reducing CO2 emissions is important - and doing it in an efficient and economically viable way is absolutely critical. From this perspective, gasification technologies are quite relevant as they enable partial or complete replacement of fossil fuels with renewable fuels. Another advantage of waste gasification is that the process provides much better electrical efficiency compared with the direct combustion of waste materials. Also, materials that would otherwise have been disposed of, such as unclean plastic, paper, cardboard and wood, and other problematic waste, are used. It is easy to modify existing boilers or industrial kilns for the gasification process - even while leaving your existing fuel systems operational in parallel or for backup. Modifying your operations for gasification creates a system that can accept many types of fuels. It can even be constructed on a scale of up to several hundred megawatts unit size. What's more, modifying an existing plant can extend its lifetime significantly. As a global leader in CFB gasification technologies and services, we offer gasification solutions to meet the needs of various power and process industry sectors. Each of these solutions generates energy from biomass and waste with high overall efficiency. |Case||Fuel||Product wood residues)||50 MW| | | Brochures | | Our expertise is at your service Our focus is to bring your performance forward.
