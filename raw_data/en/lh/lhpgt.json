Please be aware, there will be charges to your insurance. - Use a rapid antigen test. [BE SURE TO CHECK EXPIRATION DATES ON YOUR TEST(S)](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests#list). Some dates have been extended by the manufacturer, so check for your brand of test in the table in the link for the new expiration date. Using expired tests can give you inaccurate results. - Use a free Test Iowa kit. These are available to pick up at IMU Nurse Care (G-103 IMU; when open), Westlawn Student Health clinic, through the [Test Iowa site](https://www.testiowa.com/en), or [at other local sites.](https://www.testiowa.com/en/#find-a-pick-up-site) - You can always call Nurseline at Student Health 319-335-9704 and we can help you with options and decision-making. - If you want to talk with a provider about your symptoms or other concerns, call our schedulers at 319-335-8394.
