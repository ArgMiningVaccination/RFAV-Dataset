Despite the f act that plaintiffs, w ho identify themselves as N ew Yor k health ca re worker s, are no longe r required to re ceive the vac cine, they would never theless deny milli ons of Amer icans the a bility to protect themselve s and their f amilies from a da ngerous stra in of influenza, nee dlessly exposi ng them to the risk of ser ious ill ness and impeding the efforts of public hea lth officials to battle a w orldwide influenza pa ndemic. In these circumstances, plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction is as irresponsible as it is meritless. Plaintiffs have no standing to m aintain this action, given their ability to choose to receive - or not rec eive - the H 1N1 vac cine. More over, e ven if the N ew Yor k mandatory vaccination regulation were still in effect, any harm that plaintiffs might suffer as a result is attributable to the re gulation itself, not to FDA's a pproval of the vacc ine, as this Court has already observe d. See Scheduling & Show Cause Order at 3. In any event, as plaintiffs' complaint makes c lear, plaintiffs' alleg ations about the vac cine a re ba sed less on wha t FDA actua lly did - approve the vac cine lice nses on the basis of sound sc ientific evide nce - tha n on plaintiffs' spec ulative and ill-founde d fea rs about wha t FDA mig ht possibly do in the future. Plaintiffs' conjec ture, howe ver, a nd their per sonal objections to the vac cine, do not justify deny ing its availability to the Americ an public. Given the clear non-justiciability of plaintiffs' c laims, and their utter lac k of merit, plaintiffs' c omplaint should be dismi ssed for la ck of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim, and their motion for preliminary relief should be denied without a hearing.Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8 Filed 10/28/09 Page 11 of 52 The PHSA define s biologica l products as a ny \"virus, . . . applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human be ings.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(i). 2BACK GROUND I.

On June 11, 2009, the WHO declar ed a pa ndemic ale rt from pha se 5 to phase 6, r eflecting the human-to-huma n sprea d of the virus into at lea st two countries in one WHO re gion as well as c ommunity level outbre aks in at least one othe r country in a diffe rent WHO re gion. See What is nza A (H1N1) 2009 Vaccine The 2009 H1N 1 pandemic inf luenza virus emer ged in the spring of 2009, and w as ser ious enoug h to prompt FDA a nd others to take ste ps to ensure the development of a vac cine. FDA3 has extensive experience with influenza vacc ines. 1978, seasona l influenza vacc ines prote ction ag ainst one or two virus stra ins, e called \"monovalent,\" or \"biva 1-4) at 4. Since 1978, most sea sonal vaccines have been \"trivalent,\" meaning that they contain two different influenza A subtypes [A (H1N1) and A ( H3N2)] ty pe. inf luenza viruses under go frequent antig enic c hang e, which ne cessitates a nnual re assessment of the optimal strains for inclusion in the seasonal vaccines. The strains contained in the vaccine are those expected to be circulating and to cause disease. The 2009 H1N1 virus belongs to the same influenza A H 1N1 subtype as that present in the cur rently licensed se asonal trivale nt influenza vacc ines. Id. at 2. I n its approval memora nda, FDA characterized the 2009 H1N1 virus: Although pa ndemic (H 1N1) 2009 viruse s are antig enica lly distinct from previous seasona l influenza A (H1N1) human isolates, they are simil ar to c lassical swine A (H1N1) viruses and North American A (H1N1) viruses that circulated in swine in the US over the last deca de, and tha t have oc casiona lly infec ted humans during the same pe rten e t / 22 MayCase 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8 Filed 10/28/09 Page 14 of 52 These doc uments are part of the administrative re cord of FDA 's appr oval of the H 1N14 vaccine licenses. FDA has not yet assembled and filed a complete administrative record in this case due to the eme rgency nature of plaintiffs' motion. Should any of plaintiffs' c laims survive the def endants' motion to dismiss filed her ewith, FD A will compile the administrative re cord a nd submit it to the Court at its earliest opportunity. 52009/Page 1/10.1126/science .1176225). The pa ndemic (H 1N1) 2009 virus doe s not present a change in influenza A subtype, even though it has a unique genome composition not i dentified pre viously , leotide seque ncing lysis. (N Eng l J. Med 2009; 361, N Eng l. J. Med. 10.1056/ NEJM oa09038120; N. Eng l. J. Med 2009; 361. DOI : 10.1056/ NEJ Moa0903810). Id. Accordingly, although the 2009 H1N1 virus had not been previously identified, it belongs to an influenza A subty pe with which F DA is very familiar. FDA licensed four monovalent (i.e., containing only the H1N1 subty pe) va ccine s on September 15, MedI mmune, Sanofi Pasteur, CSL Limited, and l Memoranda (Exhibi ts 1-4). As set forth in its decisional memora nda, F DA conside red4 three different regulatory options for approval: (I) BLA strain cha nge supplement without clinical da ta at the time of submission. The immunogenic ity data ( the measur e of the vacc ine's ability to induce an immune r esponse) from ongoing clinical trials would be submitted post-licensure as a clinical efficacy supplement. (ii) B LA or B LA strain cha nge supplement c ontaining limited clinical da ta (such a s immunogenicity data following the first dose) from on -going clinical studies. The imm unogenicity data f ollowing the se cond dose w ould be submitted post-licensure. (iii) BL A with complete c linical datase t, i.e., submissi on of a B LA when c linical studies evalua ting immunog enicity and saf ety following two doses of the 2009 H 1N1 vac cine a re completed.Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8 Filed 10/28/09 Page 15 of 52 Aluminum salts are used as adjuvants in some U.S. licensed vaccines.

On July 23, 2009, FDA presented the licensing strategy in option (I) above to the V accines and Relate d Biolog ical Products Advisory Commi ttee for discussion and received that comm ittee's unanimous support to license the vaccine as strain change supplements without clinical data. The committee ag reed with FDA tha t this st rategy best addre ssed the urgent public health need for a pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccine, and was consistent with previous F DA re gulatory decisions conc erning influenza vac cines. The licensed 2009 H1N1 mo novalent vaccines, like the seasonal vaccines, do not contain an adjuva nt, an ag ent that ca n aug ment the spec ific immune response s to antige ns.

FDA's approval of seasonal vaccines is described as follows: Each new inac tivated sea sonal trivalent influenza va ccine (Influenza Virus ccine ) by currently licensed influe nza vacc ine manufa cture rs is licensed without additional clinical data specific for the ne w strain(s) . Eac h new live se asonal trivalent influenza virus vaccine (Influenza Vaccine Live, Intranasal) is evaluated in approximately 300 individuals prior to approval to ver ify adequa te attenua tion. Safety and effectiveness of each new seasonal vaccine are extrapolated from da ta included in the appr oved license application as w ell as the post-mar keting experience with preceding seasonal vaccines. Id. at 3. FDA has a proven track record for approving seasonal flu vaccines through supplements to exi sting B LAs, based on the information desc ribed a bove. 6 FDA has also previously licensed a monovalent vaccine like the H1N1-2009 vaccines. In 1986, FDA licensed a monovalent vaccine for a then-newly emerging antigenic variant of influenza A (H1N 1) that wa s a sig nificantly differ ent influenza strain. Id. at 4.

Docket No. FDA-2009-P-0418; see 21Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 5213C.F.R. 10.30.

Id. at 10. Under FDA regulations, the ag ency has 180 day s to respond to the petition. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.30(e) (2). Barely a month and a ha lf later, w ithout awaiting a response from F DA, plaintiffs broug ht this action, seeking substantially the same r elief a s they soug ht in their citiz en petition. Plaintiffs filed their c omplaint on October 9, 2009, r equesting among other thing s, the \"re versa l\" of the H1N1 vac cine re lief. See Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 23-24. One w eek later, on O ctober 16, 2009, plaintiffs moved for a pre liminary injunction and/or temporar y restra ining or der. Plaintiffs see k an orde r (1) withdrawing or suspending FDA 's appr oval of the four vaccines; (2) requiring FDA to reveal information about the contents of the vaccines; (3) stay ing a ll approvals of a ny vacc ines for H 1N1; (4) stay ing F DA's issuanc e of a n Emerg ency c ertain inactivated H1N 1 vacc ines; and (5) requiring FDA to make appr oval of the va ccine s conting ent upon informed c onsent. Plaintiffs identify themselves as he alth car e wor kers subjec t to a New Y ork state r egulation mandating that health care personnel receive annual influenza vaccinations as a precondition to employment. Com plaint \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8-9; see Title 10, New Y ork Codes, Rules and Reg ulations (\"NYCCR\"), Subpart 66-3 (\" Health Care Va ccina tion Requirements\" ) he reto a s Exhibit 5).

As of this date, howe ver, plaintiffs have declined to do so. 14of the H1N 1 vacc ines, they are at risk of be ing require d to rec eive the va ccine against their will or face adve rse employ ment conseque nces. See Complaint \u00b6 11; Br. at 8. The same day plaintiffs filed the instant motion, however , enfor ceme nt of the hea lth care vaccination reg ulation was stay ed by a Ne w York state court. See Orde r to Show Cause (a ttached hereto as Exhibi t 6). Subsequently, on October 23, 2009, the New York Co mmissioner of Health suspended the va ccina tion requireme nt throug h April 1, 2010, citing a shortag e in H1N1 va ccine supplies. See Letter f rom Richard F . Daines, M.D., Commissioner of He alth (Oc tober 23, 2009) (attac hed her eto as Exhibit 7). The suspe nsion letter stated that \" no new e merg ency regulations will be promulgated,\" but that New York would subsequently advance permanent regulations in draft form, and publish them for public c omment. Id. at 2. Thus, as of this date , the New York health care facility vaccination regulation is not in effect and will not resume effect until at least April 2010.14 On Octobe r 27, 2009, this Court entere d a Scheduling & Show Cause Orde r, requiring plaintiffs to show cause why this case should not be dismissed for lac k of standing .

Ar ticle I II thus require s a par ty who invokes the cour t's authority to \"'show that he persona lly has suffe red some a ctual or thre atene d injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant,' . . . and that the injury 'fairly can be traced to the cha lleng ed ac tion' and 'is likely to be re dresse d by a favorable decision.'\" Valley Forge , 454 U.S. at 472, 102 S.

In Lujan , the Supreme Court a rticulated a three -part test for dete rmining w hether a plaintiff has satisfied the \"irreducible constitutional minimum\" requirements for Article III standing: First, the plaintiff must have suffered an \"injury in fact\" - an invasion of a legally- protec ted intere st which is (a) c oncre te and pa rticularized and ( b) \"a ctual imminent, not 'conjectura l' or hy pothetical.'\" ther e must be a c ausal connec tion between the injury and the c onduct complained of - the injury has to be \"fairly . . . trac e[able] result [of] the independe nt action of some third pa rty not before the cour t.\" Third, it must be \"likely ,\" as oppose d to merely \"spec ulative,\" that the injury will be \"redresse d by a favorable decision.\" 504 U.S. at 560-61, 112 S.

Spec ifically , as noted, plaintiffs pur port to be hea lth care worke rs subject to a New York state regulation mandating that health care personnel receive annual influenza vaccinations as a precondition to employment.

Plaintiffs allege that, as a result of FDA's a pprovals of the H1N1 vac cines, they \"stand in imminent peril of risk of he alth or life, loss of liberty , proper 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8 Filed 10/28/09 Page 26 of 5217mandated or required to receive the [H1N1] Vaccines against their will and without their fully informed, voluntar y consent.\" Complaint \u00b6 11; Br. at 8. The Ne w York r egulation on which plaintiffs re ly, howeve r, wa s suspended on Oc tober 23, 2009, and is no long er in e ffect. See Daines L etter ( Exhibit 7). Thus, to the ex tent any plaintiff previously faced the prospect of mandatory vaccination, that threat has evaporated. Under these circumstances, plaintiffs c annot demonstrate that they are threa tened with any \"actual\" or \"imminent\" injury , much less injury fairly traceable to FDA' s approva l of the H1N1 va ccine s. Because plaintiffs have not established the requisite elements of Article III standing, their complaint should be dismissed. 1. Plaintif fs Face No Threat of Im minent Inju ry In order to establish \"injury in fac t,\" a plaintiff must alleg e facts sufficie nt to show that he or she will suffe r \"actual or imminent\" injury as a r esult of the cha lleng ed conduc t. Whitmore, 495 U.S. at 155, 110 S. Ct . at 1723. The injury must be \"conc rete in both a qualitative and tempor al sense,\" and it must be \"distinct and palpable \" and \" actua l or imminent,\" not \"conjec tural\" or \"hypothetical.\" Id. (citations omitted); see also Lujan , 504 U.S. 560, 112 S. Ct . at 2136. \"Alleg ations of possible future injury do not satisfy the re quirements of [Article] I II.

C t. 2301, 2309 (1979)) . If the injury has not alre ady occur red, a plaintiff must demonstrate a \"credible thre at\" of imminent future injury , see, e .g., Presbyte rian Church ( USA) v. United States , 870 F.2d 518, 528-29 (9th Cir. 1989), a nd it must be re al and immediate. See G olden v. Zwickler , 394 U.S. 103, 109, 89 S. Ct . 956, 960 (1969).

See Orde r to Show Cause (Exhibit 6). Thus, eve n at the time they broug ht their motion, plaintiffs wer e not under any threat of compe lled vacc ination. 18Plaintiffs' alleg from 10 NYCCR 66-3 which, as noted a bove, is no longe r in eff ect.

Not only did15 Commi ssioner Da ines \"suspend the require ment for the he alth car e per sonnel to be vac cinated against both influenza viruses for the current influenza sea son (throug h April 1, 2010),\" he made clear that no new emer gency regulations requiring mandatory vacc inations would be promulg ated. Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8 Filed 10/28/09 Page 28 of 52 Plaintiffs do not even attempt to establish standing on behalf of the org anizational16 plaintiffs, the Na tural Solutions Foundation and the F oundation for He alth Choice, neither of which is described in the complaint. Although plaintiffs offer certifications from p laintiff Rima Laibow, who identifie s herse lf as a \" trustee\" of the Na tural Solutions Foundation, and Tedd Kore n, who identifies himself as the \"President\" of the F oundation for He alth Choice, neither states what these organizations do or how, if at all, they have be en har med by any action of the defendants. If an organization cannot demonstrate any injury to itself, it may nevertheless be able to establish associational standing by showing that the org anization's members would have standing to sue, that the intere sts it s eeks to prote ct are germa ne to the org anization's purpose, and tha t participa tion of individual members in the lawsuit is not necessa ry. Friends of the Earth, Inc. v . Laidlaw Envt'l Serv s., Inc. , 528 U.S. 167, 181, 120 S. Ct . 693, 704 (2000); see also Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adve r. Comm'n , 432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.

The a llegations reg arding the organizational plaintiffs here, however, do not even indicate who their members are, much less provide any facts supporting a conclusion that those members have suffered cognizable injuries, or any other re quisite elements of a ssociational standing . Thus, plaintiffs' do not establish associational standing. 19Id. at 1-2. Instead, the issue would be addressed by new regulations that would be published in draft form for public c omment prior to their promulg ation. Id. Plaintiffs cannot de monstrate that they currently face any threat of \"certainly impending\" injury, and they fail to satisfy the requisite element of \"injury in fac t.\" Whitmore, 495 U.S. at 158, 110 Ct . at 1725.16 2. Plaintiffs' Alleged Inj uries Are Not Fairly Traceable to FDA's Vaccine Approvals Equally important, any injury that plaintiffs might c onceiva bly face in the future is in no sense \"fairly traceable\" to FDA's approval of the H1N1 vaccines, the action plaintiffs seek to challeng e in this case. F DA has not re quired plaintiffs to take H1N1 vac cine, nor has F DA threa tened the pla intiffs' employ ment or livelihood should they fail to do so.

It is there fore unclea r how the c halleng ed ac tions of the defe ndants, the appr oval or licensing of the identified va ccine s, are direc tly, or eve n closely , rela ted to the actions of the State of New York or the plaintiffs' employers, the actual entities to whom the har m alleg ed is log ically attributable.

Even if the New York regulation were still in effect, a party cannot maintain standing to sue the g overnme nt based on injuries c aused by the conduc t of third parties.

Plaintiffs' claims reg arding adjuvanted va ccine s are thus manifestly unripe.Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8 Filed 10/28/09 Page 34 of 5225II. Plaintif fs Are Not Entitled to P relim inary Injun ctive Relief Even if this Court were to consider plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, plaintiffs have f ailed to establish any of the re quirements for such re lief. Preliminary injunctive relief is an \"extraordinar y and dra stic remedy \" that should be spar ingly exercised. Mazurek v. Armstrong , 520 U.S. S. . 1865, (1997); Bristol-Myers 1996). To obta in a tempora ry restra ining or der or a pre liminary injunction, a party mus t demonstrate that: (1) it has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) it will suffe r irre parable injury in the absenc e of pr eliminary relief ; (3) other interested pa rties will not be substantially injured if the r equeste d relief is gr anted; and ( 4) granting such re lief would ser ve the public interest. See Katz v. Ge orgetown Univ. , 246 F.3d 685, 687-88 (D.C. Corp. v. FDA , 448 F. Supp. 2d 154, 160 (D.D .C. 2006). The likelihood of succ ess re quirement is the most important of these f actor s. Id. Indeed, \"[w]i thout any probability of pre vailing on the merits, the Plaintiffs' purporte d injuries, no matter how compelling , do not justi fy preliminary injunctive relief .\" Am. Bankers Ass'n v. Nat'l Credit Union Admin. , 38 F. Supp. 2d 114, 140 (D.D .C. 1999). As the Supreme Court r ecently made clear, \"a party seeking a pre liminary injunction must demonstrate . . .

Ge ren, 128 S. Ct . 2207, 2219 (2008) (citations omitted). Nor is a mere \"possibility\" of irreparable harm sufficient to justify a preliminary injunction: Our frequently reiterated standard requires plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief to demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absenc e of a n injunction. . . . Issuing a preliminary injunction based only on a possibility of irreparable harm isCase 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8 Filed 10/28/09 Page 35 of 5226inconsistent with our char acterization of injunctive relief a s an extraordinar y reme dy that may only be aw arded upon a cle ar showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief . Winter v. NRDC, Inc. , 129 S. Ct . 365, 375-76 (2008) (citations omitted, emphasis in orig inal). Moreove r, the pre liminary relief that plaintiffs seek in this ca se is not to preser ve the status quo, but to overturn F DA's a pproval of the H1N1 vac cines, whic h are being dispensed ar ound the country at this very moment. A court's pow er to issue such a mandatory injunction \"should be sparing ly exercised.\" Mylan Pharm., Inc. v. Shalala, 81 F. Supp. 2d 30, 36 (D.D .C. 2000). A. Plaintif fs Have No Likelihood of S uccess on the M erits As demonstrated above, plaintiffs lack standing to m aintain this action and their claims regarding adjuvanted va ccine s are unripe. B ecause plaintiffs' c omplaint is t hus subject to dismiss al for lac k of subject matter jurisdiction, they have no likelihood of succe ss on the merits. Even if the Court were to reach the merits of plaintiffs' claims, however, they would be highly unlikely to prevail. 1.

Plaintiffs contend that FDA's \"tacit\" approval of squalene violates a 2005 decision by Judge Sulli van enjoining the military from using the anthra x vacc ine, which plaintiffs a sserted c ontained squalene as an una pproved dr ug substance. B r. at 20. The licensed H 1N1 vac cines, howe ver, do not contain any adjuvant, nor do they contain squalene, as is evident from the package inserts, which fully disclose the ing redie nts for ea ch of the licensed va ccine s and ar e posted on F DA's website. See Influenza A (H 1N1) and adjuvants are based on mistaken factual premises, they should be reje cted.Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8 Filed 10/28/09 Page 42 of 52334. FDA Has Not Issued an EUA f or the H1N1 V accines Plaintiffs opine that the H1N1 flu virus is \"not in a pandemic state nor is it particularly dang erous,\" and that \"no r easona ble finder of fa ct could conc lude that there is any 'eme rgency' for which an E UA ca n be lawf ully issued.\" B r. at 24. Plaintiffs also believe order \" for administration of unapprove d vacc ines. Id. at 9. The H HS Secre tary's PREP Act dec laration is not a pre dicate a ction for a n EUA. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb-3(b)(1) (C) (listing three separate types of predicate emergency declarations, including a declaration under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247d (sec tion 319 of the Public Health Service Act), w hich is distinct from a PREP Act declaration under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247d-6d(b)). Although the Secretary's declaration of a public health eme rgency under se ction 319 of the Public Hea lth Service Ac t (not the PREP Act decla ration) c ould theoretica lly be used a s a basis for a future EUA for the H1N1 va ccine s, FDA could not do so without, among other things, first finding that several criteria have been satisfied in addition to the Secre tary's emer gency \u00a7 360bbb-3(c). Thus, to the extent plainti ffs see k to assert a claim base d upon the spec ulative possibilit y that FDA could issue an EU A in the future for H1N 1 vacc ines, any such cla im is m anife stly unripe. See Texas , 523 U.S. at 300. fs Can not the efendan ts Plaintiffs fare no better in a rguing tha t FDA' s licensure of ines violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-27( Na tional Chil dhood Vac cine I cine Ac t\").

Specifica lly, under \u00a7 300a a-27( a), the Secre tary of HHS is require d to \"promote the de velopment of childhood vac cines that re sult in fewer and less ser ious adverse reactions than those on the marke t [on Dec ember 22, 1987],\" and \"make or assure improvements in, and other wise use the authorities of the Secretary with respect to, the licensing, manufacturing, processing, testing, labeling, warning, use instructions, distribution, storage, administration, field surveillance, adverse reaction reporting, and recall of reactogenic lots or batches, of vaccines, and research on vaccines, in order to r educe the risks of adve rse reactions to vaccines.\" \u00a7 300aa-27( enfor ceable re quirements upon the Sec retary as to how improvements are to be accomplished through the use of the Secretary's enumerated authorities, nor does it otherw ise direc t the Secre tary to take any specific actions. I nstead, \u00a7 300a a-27( a) grants unfettered discretion to the Secretary to determine the appropriate manner in which to accomplish t he statute's g oals.

Chaney , should decline plaintiffs' invitation to entang le itself in a policy debate regarding how best to eff ectua te the statute's g oal of promoting safer childhood vac cines. F DA has a lready licensed the H1N1 vaccines as safe, pure, and potent. Although plaintiffs may attempt to assert a claim under the APA challenging the agency's actions, they cannot assert that FDA's approval failsCase 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8 Filed 10/28/09 Page 5235to satisfy \u00a7 300aa- 27(a) mere ly beca use it is possibl e that the Sec retary could have taken a dditional steps more to plaintiffs' liking , when F DA has de termined that the va ccine s are safe and satisfy the requirements for approval. Plaintiffs' relianc e on Berkov itz v. United States , 486 U.S. 531, 108 S. Ct . 1954 (1988), to show that safer vac cines, is misplaced. B r. at 27. In Berkovitz, the plaintiffs soug ht compensation under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"F TCA\"), a rguing tha t the polio vaccine did not meet the re gulatory licensing require ments, and that the pa rticular lot that had c aused the ir alleg ed injuries should not have be en re lease d. Plaintiffs did not claim that the Secreta ry had violated a discretionar y provision in \u00a7 300aa-27( a) to promote be tter childhood vac cines. Thus, the Court's c onclusion that the appr oval itself was nondiscr etionary for pur poses of the F TCA does not sug gest that plaintiffs have a claim against the Secretary under \u00a7 300aa-27(a), which imposes no specific require ments upon the Secre tary to cre ate he ighte ned standa rds for a pproval. Elsewher e in their brie f (but not in their complaint), Plaintiffs asse rt that \"injunctive re lief\" and \"da mages\" a re warranted unde r 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 Br . that ce rtain individuals may bring an ac tion ag ainst the Secretary for violating duties under the Childhood Vaccine Act as follows: Except a s provided in subsection (b) , any person may commence in a district court of the United States a civil action on such pe rson's own be half a gainst the Secre tary wher e ther e is alleg ailure of the Secr etary to perfor m any act or duty under this part [42 U.S .C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-10 et seq. ]. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-31( a). This provision does not author ize \"injunctive relief \" or \" damag es;\" nor does it confe r standing on these plaintiffs ba sed on their a llegation that the Secr etary violatedCase 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8 Filed 10/28/09 Page 45 of 52 By regulation, FDA r equire s that multi -use vials c ontain Secr etary, \u00a7 300aa- 27(a) is not one that does. have no c laim under \u00a7 300a a- 31(a) to assert the violation of a general duty to make childhood vac cines saf er. In addition, \u00a7 300aa-31(b) requires 60 days' written notice before comm encing an action, which plaintiffs did not provide. Thus, to the extent plaintiffs seek to invoke \u00a7 300a a-31( a), the y have ne ither complied with its requirements, nor pled any such cause of action in their complaint. Accordingly, plaintiffs' reliance on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-31(a) is unavailing. that ccine s are adultera ted bec ause the y may contain \"the alleg osal (mer cury), and the unapprove d adjuvant, MF 59 (which is believe d to contain squalene )\" is equa lly untenable. B r. at 25. Plaintiffs have no priva te rig ht of ac tion to enforce the FD CA prohibition aga inst See 21 U.S.C. ' Legal 804, 810-12, 106 S. Ct. 3229, 3234 (1986). In any event, FDA's approval of the H1N1 vaccine licenses reflects the agency's well- founded c onclusion that all of the appr cines - including MedI mmune's live virus vac cine, and some that c ontain small amounts of thimerosal as a pr eservative - ar e safe, pure , and potent and thus meet the statutory standard f or appr oval. I n fac t, live viruses and thimerosol have long been used in seasonal vaccines - products for which FDA has a proven track record of safety. In22 light of FDA's expert scientific judgment as to the safety of the H1N1 vaccines, plaintiffs' claimsCase 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8 Filed 10/28/09 Page 46 of 5237of adulter ation are of no moment and do not adva nce the ir cha lleng e to FD A's appr oval of the vaccine licenses. 6. Plaintiffs' Constitutional Argum ents Are Frivolous Plaintiffs arg ue that \"[t]he violation of the proper a pproval a nd licensing proce ss, and the evident lac k of transpa rency, rises to [ sic] level of substantive due proc ess violation,\" citing the \"rights to liberty and property protected by the 14th Amendment,\" and the \"4th and 5th Amendment rig hts to privacy and the c ontrol of their own he alth car e choic es.\" B r. at 28. Plaintiffs also assert that the F DA and/or the CDC \"violated the 14th Amendme nt's 'Constitut ional Safety Guar antee s.'\" Id. at 17. These argument merit little attention. Indeed, aside from a cursory assertion that the New York ma ndatory vaccination regulation violates the 14th Amendment, plaintiffs' c omplaint is devoid of even a citation to any provision of the Constitut ion, much less a pr operly pled constitutional claim. In any event, the 14th Ame ndment applies to the ac tions of a state, not the fe deral governme nt. United Transp. Serv. Employe v. Nat'l Mediation Bd. , 179 F.2d 446, 453 (D.C. Cir. 1949) (\"The guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . apply to state action only ; the limit ations of the F ifth Amendment, to ac tion of the Fe deral Governme nt.\"). Any asserted 14th Amendment claim against the defendants mus t therefore fail. Plaintiffs fare no better under the Fifth Amendment. The substantive due-process rights plaintiffs purport to invoke a ttach only when a \"funda mental\" inter est is at stake. See Abigail Alliance v. Esc henbach , 495 F.3d 695, 702 ( D.C. Cir. 2007). Her e, plaintiffs ha ve not asser ted any fundame ntal rig ht that it is (1) \" objectively , 'dee ply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,'\" Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8 Filed 10/28/09 Page 47 of 5238\"'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,' such that 'neither liberty nor justice would exist if [it] were sac rifice d.'\" Id. To the contra ry, plaintiffs' asse rted liberty interest appe ars to be the right not to rece ive the H1N1 va ccine s, which is irrele vant now that the Ne w York r egulation that would have subje cted them to manda tory vacc ination has bee n suspended. To the extent that plaintiffs purport to have a liberty interest in having FDA follow the \"pr oper a pproving and licensing process,\" Br. at 28, plaintiffs do not and cannot assert that such an interest is \"deeply rooted\" or that \"liberty\" and \"justice\" would be sacrificed by requiring them to raise their challenge under the APA instead of the Constitution. Plaintiffs' conclusory references to \" their 4th and 5th Amendme nt rig hts to privacy and the control of their own hea lth care choice s\" are equa lly unavailing . Indeed, the Four th Amendment's guarantee of \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures\" has no applicability to this case whatsoever. Plaintiffs' citation to their \"7th Amendme nt rig ht to a jury trial in the eve nt they suffe r dama ges\" from the H1N1 vac cine is inapposite. Plaintiffs have not taken the H1N 1 vacc ine or be en orde red to do so, let alone been injured as a result thereof. Any claim regarding the right to a jury trial is patently unripe in the a bsence of any injury or cla im for compensa tion. Thus, plaintiffs' relianc e on the Seventh Amendme nt, like the rest of its constitutional contentions, is mi splace d. B. Plaintif fs Have Not Dem onstrate d Irreparable Harm and th e Balance of Hardshi ps Weighs S trongly Against Injun ctive Relief Not only have plaintiffs failed to make the requisite showing of likely success on the merits of their c laims, they have f ailed to demonstrate that they will suffer ir reparable harm a bsent injunctive relief or that the ba lance of har ms weig hs in their favor .Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8 Filed 10/28/09 Page 48 of 52391.

Because plaintiffs' likelihood of success on the merits is exceedingly slim, they \"would have to make a ve ry substantial showing of sever e irre parable injury \" to pre vail on their motion. Nat'l Pharm. Alliance v. He nney, 47 F. Supp. 2d 41 (D.D.C. 1999); 09-867, 2009 WL 2390402 at *1 (D.D.C. Aug. 4, 2009) (\"If the plaintiff make s a par ticularly weak showing on one fa ctor . . . the othe r factors may not be enough to compensate.\") (quoting Dodd v. Fle ming , 223 F. Supp. 2d 15, 20 (D.D .C. 2002)). Irreparable injury is a very high sta ndard. See RCM Technologies, Inc. v. Beacon Hill Staffing Group, 502 F. Supp. 2d 70, 74 (D.D .C. 2007); Varicon Int'l v. O PM, 934 F. Supp. 440, 447 (D.D.C. 1996). \" The mer e possibility of irre parable har m is not enough.\" TD Int'l , 2009 WL 2390402 at *1. The injury alleg ed must be \"both c ertain and g reat,\" and it must be \"a ctual and not theore tical.\" Wis. , 758 F.2d 669, 674 ( D.C. Cir. 1985). As the D.C. Circuit has explained: \" I njunctive re lief will not be g rante d against something mer ely feared a s liable to occur at some indefinite time, . . . the pa rty seeking injunctive relief must show that [ t]he injury complained of [is] of such imminence that there is a 'clear and present' need for equitable relief to preve nt irrepa rable harm.\" Id. (citations and inter nal quotation marks omitted). Here, as noted above, the New York regulation ma ndating annual vaccinations for health care wor kers ha s been suspe nded and w ill not be reinstituted this year. Plaintiffs thus face no threa t of imminent harm. They can c hoose to be va ccina ted or not, but they will not be require d by law to receive H1N1 vaccinations as a condition of their employment. In these circumstances,Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8 Filed 10/28/09 Page 49 of 5240plaintiffs will suffer no irrepa rable harm in the a bsence of pre liminary injunctive relief . 2. The Entry of Injunctive Relief Wou ld Subs tantially Harm Others and Would be Contrary to the Public Interest By contrast, entry of the injunctive relief plaintiffs seek would cause substantial harm to others who wa nt to be vacc inated, and w ould be manife stly contra ry to the public interest. Suspending F DA's a pproval of the vacc ines - eve n temporar ily - would deny milli ons of Americ ans the a bility to protect themselve s and their f amilies from a da ngerous stra in of influenza, literally placing lives at risk and jeopa rdizing the public he alth. I t is telli ng that plaintiffs' brie f does not even discuss the ba lance of har ms. Despite the fa ct that pla'intiffs a re no long er unde r any mandate to receive the vaccine, they nevertheless seek to deprive others of the option to choose to receive this safe and ef fective vacc ine, nee dlessly exposi ng them to the risk of ser ious ill ness and impeding the efforts of public health officials to battle a worldwide influenza pandemic. Because plaintiffs will suffer no harm in the a bsence of pre liminary injunctive relief , while the entr y of such relief would cause untold harm to others and to the public he alth, the balanc e of ha rms weig hs decisively against entry of a pr eliminary injunction.Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8 Filed 10/28/09 Page 50 of 5241CONCLUSION For the fore going r easons, plaintiffs' complaint should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and fa ilure to state a c laim upon which re lief ca n be g rante d, and their motion for pr eliminary injunction should be denied.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR APPROVAL a. Regulatory Options: x e to pandemi c (H1N1) 2009 virus emphasizes the need for s as T F Director, Office of Vaccine S vaccines for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic as a strain change supplement P M I. Tunder Section 351 of the Public Health Serv ice Act to MedImmune's biologics license application (BLA) for Influenza Vaccine Li ve, Intranasal to include unadjuvanted, Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine Live, Intranasal for the 2009 pandem II II The e tent of global disease du development and timely deployment of v accine. FDA has considered applicable regulatory options to facilitate the licen sure of unadjuvanted, monovalent vaccines against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. These options only pertain to unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccines manuf actured using the same processe used for currently U.S. licensed trivalent seas onal vaccines and formulated to contain the same quantity of antigen as a single strain of the seasonal vaccine: OVRR - Page 1 Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-1 Filed 10/28/09 Page 2 of 8Regulatory Memorandum September 15, 2009 (i) BLA strain change supplement without clinical data at the time of submission. The immunogenicity data from ongoing cl inical trials would be submitted post- licensure as a clinical efficacy supplement. (ii) BLA or BLA strain ch ange supplement containing limited clinical data such as post-dose one immunogenicity data from on- going clinical studies. The post-dose 2 immunogenicity data would be submitted post-licensure. (iii) BLA with complete clinical dataset, i.e., submission of a BLA when clinical studies evaluating immunoge nicity and safety following two doses of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine are completed. OVRR discussed these options with FDA seni or management including Drs. Margaret Hamburg, Jesse Goodman, Mary Lou Valdez and Murray Lumpkin on June 5, 2009. On July 10, 2009, representatives from FDA briefed staff from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and other Agencies within DHHS on these licensure issues during a meeting attended by, among others, HHS Chief of Staff Laura Petrou, ASPR Dr. Nicole Lurie, Dr. Bruce Gellin (NVPO) a nd Dr. Anthony Fauci (NIAID). FDA noted that in the case of an urgent public hea lth need for a pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccine, option (i) above, i.e., submission of a BLA strain change supplement without clinical data at the time of submission, provi des the most expeditious regulatory pathway to licensure among the legally permissible options . Furthermore, this option is consistent with previous FDA regulatory decisi ons concerning influenza vaccines. On July 23, 2009, FDA presented this licensu re strategy to the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) for discussion and received unanimous support from the VRBPAC me mbers for licensure of unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza v accines as strain change supplements. II b. Characteristics of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Virus: The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus belongs to the same influenza A H1N1 subtype as those present in currently licensed seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines . Influenza A virus H1N1 subtypes have circulated globa lly from at least the mid-1930s until 1957, reappeared in 1977 and have since caused influenza disease in the United States 2009 are antigenically distinct from previous seasonal influenza A (H1N1) human isolates, they are similar to classical swine A (H1N1) viruses and North Ameri can A (H1N1) viruses that circ ulated in swine in the US over the last decade, and that have occasionally infected humans during the same period (Garten et al, Sciencexpress / www.sciencexpress.org / 22 May 2009/Page 1/10.1126/science.1176225 ). The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus does not present a change in influenza A subtype, even though it has a unique genome composition not identified previously, based on nucleotid e sequencing and phyl ogenetic analysis. (N 8-1 Filed 10/28/09 Page 3 of 8Regulatory Memorandum September 15, 2009 II c. Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Strain Change Supplements: Gradual antigenic change in the influenza vi rus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens requires annual assessment of in fluenza vaccine strains as well as annual administration of the trivalent seasonal influe nza vaccine. Therefore, each year FDA and the VRBPAC consider the optimal strains for in clusion in the seasonal trivalent vaccines. Following strain selection ma nufacturers submit strain change supplements to their license applications. Each new inactivated seasonal vaccine (Influenza Virus Vaccine) made by currently licensed influenza v accine manufacturers is licensed without additional clinical data specific for the new strain(s). Each new live influenza virus vaccine (Influenza Vaccine Live, Intranas al) is evaluated in approximately 300 individuals prior to approval to verify adequate attenuation. Safety and effectiveness of each new seasonal vaccine are extrapolated fr om data included in the approved license application as well as the post-marketing experience with preceding seasonal vaccines. Approved dosing regimens for seasonal trivalen t vaccine for children and adults usually remain unchanged for strain change supplem ents and are based on clinical studies performed in the 1970s that demonstrated that children and adults unexposed to influenza either through natural infec tion or vaccination required two doses of inactivated vaccine to achieve acceptable antibody levels while pe rsons with pre-existing immunity required a single dose ( Plotkin and Orenstein 4th edition, p. 350 ). Moreover, among adults, studies have indicated limited or no improve ment in antibody response when a second dose is administered during the same season ( Gross et al. J Clin Microbiol Med Levine et suggests that these indi viduals are immunologically primed to respond adequately to a single dos e of vaccine formulated with an influenza subtype that is closely related to previous subtypes.. II d. Unadjuvanted, Monovalent, Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Virus Vaccines Strain Change Supplements: Manufacturers of licensed seasonal influenza vacc ines file a manufacturing strain change supplement to their existing BLA for the tr ivalent seasonal vaccine. The unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus va ccine will be manufactured using the licensed process and will be considered a strain change. Consistent with the data required for the seasonal vaccine strain change , clinical safety and immunogenicity data at the time of licensure will not be required for an inactivated unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine. For unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 live virus vaccine, as is the case with th e seasonal live attenuate d influenza vaccine, limited clinical safety data will be provided prior to licensure. Safety and effectiveness of each monovalent vaccine is extrapolated from data included in the approved seasonal license application as well as the post-mark eting experience with seasonal vaccines. Each strain change supplement for pande mic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine will reference the nonclinical, chemistry, manufactur ing, and controls (CMC) info rmation and clinical data in the original approved BLA for trivalent influenza vaccine. MedImmune has initiated clinical studies with monovalent Influen za A (H1N1) 2009 Vaccine to determine the, number of doses. These data will be subm itted to each license application as clinical efficacy supplements after approval of the strain change supplements. OVRR - Page 3 Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-1 Filed 10/28/09 Page 4 of 8Regulatory Memorandum September 15, 2009 Although pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus belongs to the same influenza H1N1 subtype currently included in licensed seasonal trival ent influenza vaccines, data suggest that children 6 months to 9 years of age are la rgely serologically na \u00efve to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus (MMWR 2009; 58(19) 521-5 24). Based on these data, children 9 years of age and younger should be administered 2 doses of the monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine. Available data indicates that among adults some degree of pre-existing immunity to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus exists, especially among those aged >60 years. Based on data from seasona l influenza vaccines we expect individuals 10 to 17 years of age to respond similarly to adults, so individuals 10 years of age and older should be administered 1 dose of monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine. This dosing regimen, in which immunologically na\u00efve persons receive 2 doses and primed individuals receive one dose is similar to that used for seasonal influenza vaccines. Licensed unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemi c (H1N1) 2009 vaccine would be labeled for use in the same populations as the resp ective seasonal trivalent vaccine. Thus, only those manufacturers with a currently licensed seasonal vaccine for use in children could obtain licensure of vaccine for active immunization against influenza disease caused by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in that population. III. REGULATORY PRECEDENT FO R LICENSURE OF A MONOVALENT VACCINE AS A STRAIN CHANGE SUPPLEMENT Before 1978 influenza vaccines were monovale nt and bivalent; since 1978, most US licensed influenza vaccines have been trival ent incorporating infl uenza A (H1N1), and A (H3N2) subtype viruses and an influenza B virus ( Fukuda, K., et al in Plotkin, Vaccines 4 th Edition, Elsevier, p. 349 ). Monovalent vaccines have been licensed and distributed by FDA in the past; one such example was in 1986, when a supplemental monovalent influenza A H1N1 subtype (A/Taiwan/1/86) vaccine was licensed. Influenza A/Taiwan/1/86 H1N1 virus began to circulate among the human population in 1986. This virus represented a newly emerged antigenic variant of influen za A (H1N1) and was considered to be a significantly different influenza strain, relative to prev ious influenza A H1N1 virus isolates ( Robertson et al, J. gen. Virol. 68:1205-1208, 1987). Influenza A/Tawain/1/86 H1N1 attack rates among individuals who had previously received seasonal trivalent in fluenza vaccine were not significantly different from rates among t hose who had not been vaccinated providing evidence that subjects had little prior immunity to this new vaccine strain. Furthermore, this virus affected a wider range of age groups and was poorly i nhibited by antibodies induced by H1N1 strains circulating since 1977 ( Iorio eta al, Eur. J. Epid. 12:589-594, 1996, Teare et al, Brit. J. Gen. Prac, 40:10-12, 1990 ). Despite these novel characteristics of influenza A/Taiwan/1/86 H1N1 virus, a monovalent influenza A/Taiwan/1/86 H1N1 virus vaccine was considered a strain change and was licensed as a supplemental vaccine OVRR - Page 4 Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-1 Filed 10/28/09 Page 5 of 8Regulatory Memorandum September 15, 2009 following submission of an amendment (these are now supplements) to each manufacturer's license applicati on for Influenza Virus Vaccine. A search of archived files in FDA showed that Wyeth Laboratories amended its license application for \"Influenza Virus Vaccine, Tr ivalent Types A and B\" in November 1986 to include monovalent influenza A H1N1 subt ype (A/Taiwan/1/86). This vaccine was marketed as \"Influenza virus vaccine, monovalent, type A 1986-87 supplemental vaccine.\" Similarly, Connaught Laboratories (now Sanofi Pasteur) and Parke Davis amended their license applications (and FDA approved such amendments) for Influenza virus vaccine in October of 1986 to include monovalent A/Taiwan influenza vaccine strain as a supplemental vaccine for the 1986-87 season. Clinical data were not submitted to FDA concerning these supplemental vaccines. IV. FDA GUIDANCE CONCERNING TH E LICENSURE OF PANDEMIC VACCINES FDA has issued guidance concerning the licensure of pandemic vaccines. To the extent that the strain change supplement approach to licensure is not specifically described in such guidance it is important to note the followi ng distinctions between the current public health emergency (as declared under secti on 319 of the Public H ealth Service Act) concerning disease caused by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus and the factual assumptions behind previous FDA guidance. The FDA Gu idance document \"Clinical Data Needed to Support the Licensure of Pandemic Influen za Vaccines\" (May 2007) was intended to provide FDA's current thinking regarding criteria to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of influenza vaccines against potential pandemi c strains. At the time this guidance was published (May 2007), disease caused by avia n influenza A H5N1 subtype was of particular concern due to out breaks in poultry and sporadic human infections. The H5N1 virus contains a hemagglutinin subtype that had not been isolated from humans prior to the emergence of human infections w ith the avian H5N1 influenza virus ( hemagglutinin is thought to be responsible, at least in part, for the more severe disease as compared to disease caused by seasonal influenza viruses ( Gambotto et al. 2008 Lancet 371: 1464-1475). One influenza A H5N1 vaccine manufactured by sanofi pasteur is licensed for use in the U.S. and is contained in the National Stockpile. Because of the limited clinical experience with influenza A H5N1 subtype virus vaccines, the clinical evaluation of prospective ad juvanted and unadjuvanted H5N1 subtype vaccines was considered an essential component of preparedness. Thus, the focus of FDA's guidance in 2007 was on clinical deve lopment to facilitate and expedite the licensure of such vaccines for pandemic prep aredness. In contrast to what has been observed with H5N1 influenza virus, ep idemiologic data for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus indicate human-to-human spread and sustained community level outbreaks emphasizing the need to make a vaccine availa ble as soon as possible. Furthermore, due to the similarities in influenza strain a nd subtype, as well as the use of the same manufacturing process for both the currently li censed seasonal influenza vaccines and the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccines, it is scientifically valid to extrapolate the safety and OVRR - Page 5 Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-1 Filed 10/28/09 Page 6 of 8Regulatory Memorandum September 15, 2009 effectiveness data supporting licensure of the seasonal vaccines to support approval of strain change supplements for the vaccine s against pandemic (H1N1) 2009. In addition, licensure of a supplemental monovalent 2009 H1N1 is consistent with past regulatory actions as previously stated above. Because H1N1 vaccine strains have been incorporated in influenza vaccines for human use for decades, the regulatory pathway for licensure of the unadjuvanted, monovalent2009 (H1N1) virus vaccine should follow that of seasonal H1N1 vaccines. In addition, FDA's guidance entitled \"Clinical Data Needed to Support the Licensure of Pandemic Influenza Vaccines\" (May 2007) s uggests that submission of a BLA, as opposed to a BLA supplement, may be benefici al for the agency as it addresses trade name and labeling matters concerning the pandemic vaccine. These are important issues to be addressed; however, it is not the case that their reso lution requires submission of a separate BLA. The proper names Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine and Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine Li ve, Intranasal have been assigned to these vaccines to distinguish them from th e trivalent seasonal vaccines. In 1986 the supplemental vaccine was assigned a unique proper name (Influenza Virus Vaccine, Monovalent, Type A) to distingu ish it from the licensed trival ent vaccine. Submission of a BLA supplement should not be an impediment to tracking and differentiating postmarketing adverse events for monovale nt pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine versus licensed trivalent vaccine. Post distribution surveillance for adverse events associated with monovalent vaccine use will be performed. Currently, the expectation is that events will be detected and evaluated using a number of systems including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to detect signals, as well as the Vaccine Safety Data (VSD) Link and collaborations wi th other data base systems such as the Department of Defense to detect signals and evaluate events associated with use. Lastly, FDA's guidance on Submitting Separate Marketing Applicat ions and Clinical Data for Purposes of Assessing User Fees , (December 2004) commonly referred to as \"the bundling policy\" does not preclude the st rain change supplement approach to the licensure of unadjuvanted, monovalent pa ndemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccines by licensed manufacturers of seasonal influenza vaccine s. This guidance was intended to explain what changes that required supporting clinical data could be grouped together in a single submission that would be assessed a single user fee as opposed to being reported in multiple submissions requiring multiple user fees. It also provides criteria to determine whether a change is more appropriately considered an efficacy supplement or a new application. The guidance does not appear to distinguish between efficacy supplements and Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (C MC) supplements, which are not assessed a user fee. Supplements for strain changes to the seasonal Influenza vaccines have been, and continue to be, considered CMC supplements. V.

II II The e tent of global disease du development and timely deployment of v accine. FDA has considered applicable regulatory options to facilitate the licen sure of unadjuvanted, monovalent vaccines against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. These options only pertain to unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccines manuf actured using the same processe used for currently U.S. licensed seasonal triv alent influenza vaccines and formulated to contain the same quantity of antigen as a single strain of the seasonal vaccine: OVRR - Page 1 Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-2 Filed 10/28/09 Page 2 of 8Regulatory Memorandum September 15, 2009 (i) BLA strain change supplement without clinical data at the time of submission. The immunogenicity data from ongoing cl inical trials would be submitted post- licensure as a clinical efficacy supplement. (ii) BLA or BLA strain ch ange supplement containing limited clinical data such as post-dose one immunogenicity data from on- going clinical studies. The post-dose 2 immunogenicity data would be submitted post-licensure. (iii) BLA with complete clinical dataset, i.e., submission of a BLA when clinical studies evaluating immunoge nicity and safety following two doses of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine are completed. OVRR discussed these options with FDA seni or management including Drs. Margaret Hamburg, Jesse Goodman, Mary Lou Valdez and Murray Lumpkin on June 5, 2009. On July 10, 2009, representatives from FDA briefed staff from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and other Agencies within DHHS on these licensure issues during a meeting attended by, among others, HHS Chief of Staff Laura Petrou, ASPR Dr. Nicole Lurie, Dr. Bruce Gellin (NVPO) a nd Dr. Anthony Fauci (NIAID). FDA noted that in the case of an urgent public hea lth need for a pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccine, option (i) above, i.e., submission of a BLA strain change supplement without clinical data at the time of submission, provi des the most expeditious regulatory pathway to licensure among the legally permissible options . Furthermore, this option is consistent with previous FDA regulatory decisions concerning influenza vaccines. On July 23, 2009, FDA presented this licensu re strategy to the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) for discussion and received unanimous support from the VRBPAC me mbers for licensure of unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza v accines as strain change supplements without clinical data. II b. Characteristics of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Virus: The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus belongs to the same influenza A H1N1 subtype as those present in currently licensed seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines . Influenza A virus H1N1 subtypes have circulated globa lly from at least the mid-1930s until 1957, reappeared in 1977 and have since caused influenza disease in the United States 2009 are antigenically distinct from previous seasonal influenza A (H1N1) human isolates, they are similar to classical swine A (H1N1) viruses and North Ameri can A (H1N1) viruses that circ ulated in swine in the US over the last decade, and that have occasionally infected humans during the same period (Garten et al, Sciencexpress / www.sciencexpress.org / 22 May 2009/Page 1/10.1126/science.1176225 ). The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus does not present a change in influenza A subtype, even though it has a unique genome composition not identified previously, based on nucleotid e sequencing and phyl ogenetic analysis. (N Engl Page 2 Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-2 Filed 10/28/09 Page 3 of 8Regulatory Memorandum September 15, 2009 J. Med 2009; 361, N Engl. J. Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Strain Change Supplements: Gradual antigenic change in the influenza vi rus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens requires annual assessment of in fluenza vaccine strains as well as annual administration of the seasonal trivalent influe nza vaccine. Therefore, each year FDA and the VRBPAC consider the optimal strains for inclusion in the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines. Following strain selection manufact urers submit strain change supplements to their license applications. Each new inac tivated seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (Influenza Virus Vaccine) made by currently li censed influenza vaccine manufacturers is licensed without additional clinical data specific for the new strain(s). Each new live seasonal trivalent influenza virus vaccine (Influenza Vaccine Live, Intranasal) is evaluated in approximately 300 individuals prior to approval to verify adequate attenuation. Safety and effectiveness of each new seasonal vaccine are extrapolated from data included in the approve d license application as well as the post-marketing experience with preced ing seasonal vaccines. Approved dosing regimens for seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine for children and adults usually remain unchanged for strain ch ange supplements and are based on clinical studies performed in the 1970s that demonstr ated that children and adults unexposed to influenza either through natural infection or vaccination required two doses of inactivated vaccine to achieve acceptable antibody levels while persons with pre-existing immunity required a single dose ( Plotkin and Orenstein 4 th edition, p. 350 ). Moreover, among adults, studies have indicated limited or no improvement in antibody response when a second dose is administered during the same season ( Gross et al. J Clin Microbiol Med Levine et suggests that these indi viduals are immunologically primed to respond adequately to a single dos e of vaccine formulated with an influenza subtype that is closely related to previ ously circulating subtypes.. II d. Unadjuvanted, Monovalent, Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Virus Vaccines Strain Change Supplements: Manufacturers of licensed seas onal trivalent influenza vaccines file a manufacturing strain change supplement to their existing BLA for the trivalent seasonal vaccine. The unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine will be manufactured using the licensed process and will be considered a strain change. Consistent with the data required for the seasonal vaccine strain change, clinical safety and immunogenicity data at the time of licensure will not be required for an inactivated unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus va ccine. For unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 live virus vaccine, as is th e case with the seasonal live attenuated influenza vaccine, limited clinical safety data will be provided prior to licensure. Safety and effectiveness of each monova lent vaccine is extrapolated from data included in the approved seasonal license appl ication as well as the post-marketing experience with seasonal vaccines. Each strain change supplement for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine will reference the nonclinical, chem istry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) information and clinical data in the original approved BLA for seasonal trivalent OVRR - Page 3 Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-2 Filed 10/28/09 Page 4 of 8Regulatory Memorandum September 15, 2009 influenza vaccine. Sanofi Past eur has initiated clinical studies with Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine to determine the optimal dosage, number of doses and schedule. These data will be submitted to th eir license application as a clinical efficacy supplement after approval of the strain change supplement. Although pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus belongs to the same influenza H1N1 subtype currently included in licensed seasonal trival ent influenza vaccines, data suggest that children 6 months to 9 years of age are la rgely serologically na \u00efve to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus (MMWR 2009; 58(19) 521-5 24). Based on these data, children 9 years of age and younger should be administered 2 doses of the monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine. Available data indi cate that among adults some degree of pre-existing immunity to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus exists, especially among those aged >60 years. Based on data from seasona l influenza vaccines we expect individuals 10 to 17 years of age to respond similarly to adults, so individuals 10 years of age and older should be administered 1 dose of monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine. This dosing regimen, in which immunologically na\u00efve persons receive 2 doses and primed individuals receive one dose is similar to that used for seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines. Licensed unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemi c (H1N1) 2009 vaccine would be labeled for use in the same populations as the respec tive seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine. Thus, only those manufacturers with a currently licensed influenza vaccine for use in children could obtain licensure of vaccine for active immunization against influenza disease caused by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in that population. III. REGULATORY PRECEDENT FO R LICENSURE OF A MONOVALENT VACCINE AS A STRAIN CHANGE SUPPLEMENT Before 1978 influenza vaccines were monovale nt and bivalent; since 1978, most US licensed influenza vaccines have been trival ent incorporating infl uenza A (H1N1), and A (H3N2) subtype viruses and an influenza B virus ( Fukuda, K., et al in Plotkin, Vaccines 4 th Edition, Elsevier, p. 349 ). Monovalent vaccines have been licensed and distributed by FDA in the past; one such example was in 1986, when a supplemental monovalent influenza A H1N1 subtype (A/Taiwan/1/86) vaccine was licensed. Influenza A/Taiwan/1/86 H1N1 virus began to circulate among the human population in 1986. This virus represented a newly emerged antigenic variant of influen za A (H1N1) and was considered to be a significantly different influenza strain, relative to prev ious influenza A H1N1 virus isolates ( Robertson et al, J. gen. Virol. 68:1205-1208, 1987). Influenza A/Tawain/1/86 H1N1 attack rates among individuals who had previously received seasonal trivalent in fluenza vaccine were not significantly different from rates among t hose who had not been vaccinated providing evidence that subjects had little prior immunity to this new vaccine strain. Furthermore, this virus affected a wider range of age groups compared to previously circulating strains, and was poorly inhibited by antibodies induced by H1N1 strains circulating since 1977 OVRR - Page 4 Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-2 Filed 10/28/09 Page 5 of 8Regulatory Memorandum September 15, 2009 (Iorio eta al, Eur. J. Epid. 12:589-594, 1996, Teare et al, Brit. J. Gen. Prac, 40:10-12, 1990). Despite these novel characteristics of influenza A/Taiwan/1/86 H1N1 virus, a monovalent influenza A/Taiwan/1/86 H1N1 viru s vaccine was considered a strain change and was licensed as a supplemental vaccine following submission of an amendment (these are now supplements) to each manufact urer's license application for Influenza Virus Vaccine. A search of archived files in FDA showed that Wyeth Laboratories amended its license application for \"Influenza Virus Vaccine, Tr ivalent Types A and B\" in November 1986 to include monovalent influenza A H1N1 subt ype (A/Taiwan/1/86). This vaccine was marketed as \"Influenza virus vaccine, monovalent, type A 1986-87 supplemental vaccine.\" Similarly, Connaught Laboratories (now Sanofi Pasteur) and Parke Davis amended their license applications (and FDA approved such amendments) for Influenza Virus Vaccine in October of 1986 to incl ude monovalent A/Taiwan/1/86 influenza vaccine strain as a supplemental vaccine for the 1986-87 season. Clinical data were not submitted to FDA concerning these supplemental vaccines. IV. FDA GUIDANCE CONCERNING TH E LICENSURE OF PANDEMIC VACCINES FDA has issued guidance concerning the licensure of pandemic influenza vaccines. To the extent that the strain change supplement approach to licensure is not specifically described in such guidance it is important to note the following distinctions between the current public health emergency (as declared under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act) concerning disease caused by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vi rus and the factual assumptions behind previous FDA guidance. The FDA Guidance document \"Clinical Data Needed to Support the Licensure of Pandemic Influenza Vaccines\" (May 2007) was intended to provide FDA's current thinking regarding criteria to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of influenza vaccines against pote ntial pandemic strains. At the time this guidance was published (May 2007), disease cau sed by avian influenza A H5N1 subtypes was of particular concern due to outbreaks in poultry and sporadic human infections. The H5N1 virus contains a hemagglutinin subtype that had not been isolated from humans prior to the emergence of human infections with the avian H5N1 influenza virus ( hemagglutinin is thought to be responsible, at least in part, for the more severe disease as compared to disease caused by seasonal influenza viruses ( Gambotto et al. 2008 Lancet 371: 1464-1475).

Thus, the focus of FDA's guidance in 2007 was on clinical deve lopment to facilitate and expedite the licensure of such vaccines for pandemic prep aredness. In contrast to what has been observed with H5N1 influenza virus, ep idemiologic data for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus indicate human-to-human spread and sustained community level outbreaks OVRR - Page 5 Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-2 Filed 10/28/09 Page 6 of 8Regulatory Memorandum September 15, 2009 emphasizing the need to make a vaccine availa ble as soon as possible. Furthermore, due to the similarities in influenza subtype be tween the current and previously circulating H1N1 viruses, as well as the use of the sa me manufacturing process for both the currently licensed seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine s and the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccines, it is scientifically valid to extr apolate the safety and effectiv eness data suppo rting licensure of the seasonal vaccines to support approval of strain change supplements for the vaccines against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. In addition, licensure of a supplemental monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine is cons istent with past regulatory actions as previously stated above. Because H1N1 v accine strains have be en incorporated in influenza vaccines for human use for decades, the regulatory pathway for licensure of the unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine should follow that of seasonal H1N1 vaccines. In addition, FDA's guidance entitled \"Clinical Data Needed to Support the Licensure of Pandemic Influenza Vaccines\" (May 2007) s uggests that submission of a BLA, as opposed to a BLA supplement, may be benefici al for the agency as it addresses trade name and labeling matters concerning the pandemic vaccine. These are important issues to be addressed; however, it is not the case that their reso lution requires submission of a separate BLA. The proper names Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine and Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine Li ve, Intranasal have been assigned to these vaccines to distinguish them from the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines. In 1986 the supplemental vaccine was assigned a unique proper name (Influenza Virus Vaccine, Monovalent, Type A) to distinguish it from the licensed seasonal trivalent vaccine. Submission of a BLA supplement should not be an impediment to tracking and differentiating postmarketing adverse even ts for monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine versus licensed seasonal trivalen t influenza vaccine. Post distribution surveillance for adverse events associat ed with monovalent vaccine use will be performed. Currently, the expectation is that events will be detected and evaluated using a number of systems including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to detect signals, as well as the Vaccine Sa fety Data (VSD) Link and collaborations with other data base systems such as the Department of Defense to detect signals and evaluate events associated with use. Lastly, FDA's guidance on Submitting Separate Marketing Applicat ions and Clinical Data for Purposes of Assessing User Fees , (December 2004) commonly referred to as \"the bundling policy\" does not preclude the st rain change supplement approach to the licensure of unadjuvanted, monovalent pa ndemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccines by licensed manufacturers of seasonal influenza vaccine s.

It also provides criteria to determine whether a change is more appropriately considered an efficacy supplement or a new application. The guidance does not appear to distinguish between clinical efficacy supplements and Chemistry Manufacturing a nd Controls (CMC) supplements, which are not assessed a user fee. Supplements for stra in changes to the seas onal trivalent influenza vaccines have been, and continue to be, considered CMC supplements.

Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Strain Change Supplements: Gradual antigenic change in the influenza vi rus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens requires annual assessment of in fluenza vaccine strains as well as annual administration of the trivalent seasonal influe nza vaccine.

Following strain selection ma nufacturers submit strain change supplements to their license applications. Each new inactivated seasonal vaccine (Influenza Virus Vaccine) made by currently licensed influenza v accine manufacturers is licensed without additional clinical data specific for the new strain(s). Each new live influenza virus vaccine (Influenza Vaccine Live, Intranas al) is evaluated in approximately 300 individuals prior to approval to verify adequate attenuation. Safety and effectiveness of each new seasonal vaccine are extrapolated fr om data included in the approved license application as well as the post-marketing experience with preceding seasonal vaccines. Approved dosing regimens for seasonal trivalen t vaccine for children and adults usually remain unchanged for strain change supplem ents and are based on clinical studies performed in the 1970s that demonstrated that children and adults unexposed to influenza either through natural infec tion or vaccination required two doses of inactivated vaccine to achieve acceptable antibody levels while pe rsons with pre-existing immunity required a single dose ( Plotkin and Orenstein 4th edition, p. 350 ). Moreover, among adults, studies have indicated limited or no improve ment in antibody response when a second dose is administered during the same season ( Gross et al. J Clin Microbiol Med Levine et suggests that these indi viduals are immunologically primed to respond adequately to a single dos e of vaccine formulated with an influenza subtype that is closely related to previous subtypes.. II d. Unadjuvanted, Monovalent, Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Virus Vaccines Strain Change Supplements: Manufacturers of licensed seasonal influenza vacc ines file a manufacturing strain change supplement to their existing BLA for the tr ivalent seasonal vaccine. The unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus va ccine will be manufactured using the licensed process and will be considered a strain change. Consistent with the data required for the seasonal vaccine strain change , clinical safety and immunogenicity data at the time of licensure will not be required for an inactivated unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine. For unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 live virus vaccine, as is the case with th e seasonal live attenuate d influenza vaccine, limited clinical safety data will be provided prior to licensure. Safety and effectiveness of each monovalent vaccine is extrapolated from data included in the approved seasonal license application as well as the post-mark eting experience with seasonal vaccines. Each strain change supplement for pande mic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine will reference the nonclinical, chemistry, manufactur ing, and controls (CMC) info rmation and clinical data in the original approved BLA for trivalent in fluenza vaccine. CSL Limited has initiated clinical studies with monovalent Influen za A (H1N1) 2009 Vaccine to determine the optimal dosage, number of doses and schedule. These data will be submitted to each OVRR - Page 3 Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-3 Filed 10/28/09 Page 4 of 8Regulatory Memorandum September 15, 2009 license application as clinical efficacy supplements after a pproval of the strain change supplements. Although pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus belongs to the same influenza H1N1 subtype currently included in licensed seasonal trival ent influenza vaccines, data suggest that children 6 months to 9 years of age are la rgely serologically na \u00efve to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus (MMWR 2009; 58(19) 521-5 24). Based on these data, children 9 years of age and younger should be administered 2 doses of the monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine. Available data indicates that among adults some degree of pre-existing immunity to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus exists, especially among those aged >60 years. Based on data from seasona l influenza vaccines we expect individuals 10 to 17 years of age to respond similarly to adults, so individuals 10 years of age and older should be administered 1 dose of monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine. This dosing regimen, in which immunologically na\u00efve persons receive 2 doses and primed individuals receive one dose is similar to that used for seasonal influenza vaccines. Licensed unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemi c (H1N1) 2009 vaccine would be labeled for use in the same populations as the resp ective seasonal trivalent vaccine. Thus, only those manufacturers with a currently licensed seasonal vaccine for use in children could obtain licensure of vaccine for active immunization against influenza disease caused by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in that population. III. REGULATORY PRECEDENT FO R LICENSURE OF A MONOVALENT VACCINE AS A STRAIN CHANGE SUPPLEMENT Before 1978 influenza vaccines were monovale nt and bivalent; since 1978, most US licensed influenza vaccines have been trival ent incorporating infl uenza A (H1N1), and A (H3N2) subtype viruses and an influenza B virus ( Fukuda, K., et al in Plotkin, Vaccines 4 th Edition, Elsevier, p. 349 ). Monovalent vaccines have been licensed and distributed by FDA in the past; one such example was in 1986, when a supplemental monovalent influenza A H1N1 subtype (A/Taiwan/1/86) vaccine was licensed. Influenza A/Taiwan/1/86 H1N1 virus began to circulate among the human population in 1986. This virus represented a newly emerged antigenic variant of influen za A (H1N1) and was considered to be a significantly different influenza strain, relative to prev ious influenza A H1N1 virus isolates ( Robertson et al, J. gen. Virol. 68:1205-1208, 1987). Influenza A/Tawain/1/86 H1N1 attack rates among individuals who had previously received seasonal trivalent in fluenza vaccine were not significantly different from rates among t hose who had not been vaccinated providing evidence that subjects had little prior immunity to this new vaccine strain. Furthermore, this virus affected a wider range of age groups and was poorly i nhibited by antibodies induced by H1N1 strains circulating since 1977 ( Iorio eta al, Eur. J. Epid. 12:589-594, 1996, Teare et al, Brit. J. Gen. Prac, 40:10-12, 1990 ). Despite these novel characteristics of H1N1 virus, a monovalent influenza A/Taiwan/1/86 H1N1 4 Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-3 Filed 10/28/09 Page 5 of 8Regulatory Memorandum September 15, 2009 virus vaccine was considered a strain change and was licensed as a supplemental vaccine following submission of an amendment (these are now supplements) to each manufacturer's license applicati on for Influenza Virus Vaccine. A search of archived files in FDA showed that Wyeth Laboratories amended its license application for \"Influenza Virus Vaccine, Tr ivalent Types A and B\" in November 1986 to include monovalent influenza A H1N1 subt ype (A/Taiwan/1/86). This vaccine was marketed as \"Influenza virus vaccine, monovalent, type A 1986-87 supplemental vaccine.\" Similarly, Connaught Laboratories (now Sanofi Pasteur) and Parke Davis amended their license applications (and FDA approved such amendments) for Influenza virus vaccine in October of 1986 to include monovalent A/Taiwan influenza vaccine strain as a supplemental vaccine for the 1986-87 season. Clinical data were not submitted to FDA concerning these supplemental vaccines. IV. FDA GUIDANCE CONCERNING TH E LICENSURE OF PANDEMIC VACCINES FDA has issued guidance concerning the licensure of pandemic vaccines. To the extent that the strain change supplement approach to licensure is not specifically described in such guidance it is important to note the followi ng distinctions between the current public health emergency (as declared under secti on 319 of the Public H ealth Service Act) concerning disease caused by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus and the factual assumptions behind previous FDA guidance. The FDA Gu idance document \"Clinical Data Needed to Support the Licensure of Pandemic Influen za Vaccines\" (May 2007) was intended to provide FDA's current thinking regarding criteria to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of influenza vaccines against potential pandemi c strains. At the time this guidance was published (May 2007), disease caused by avia n influenza A H5N1 subtype was of particular concern due to out breaks in poultry and sporadic human infections. The H5N1 virus contains a hemagglutinin subtype that had not been isolated from humans prior to the emergence of human infections w ith the avian H5N1 influenza virus ( hemagglutinin is thought to be responsible, at least in part, for the more severe disease as compared to disease caused by seasonal influenza viruses ( Gambotto et al. 2008 Lancet 371: 1464-1475). One influenza A H5N1 vaccine manufactured by sanofi pasteur is licensed for use in the U.S. and is contained in the National Stockpile. Because of the limited clinical experience with influenza A H5N1 subtype virus vaccines, the clinical evaluation of prospective ad juvanted and unadjuvanted H5N1 subtype vaccines was considered an essential component of preparedness. Thus, the focus of FDA's guidance in 2007 was on clinical deve lopment to facilitate and expedite the licensure of such vaccines for pandemic prep aredness. In contrast to what has been observed with H5N1 influenza virus, ep idemiologic data for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus indicate human-to-human spread and sustained community level outbreaks emphasizing the need to make a vaccine availa ble as soon as possible. Furthermore, due to the similarities in influenza strain a nd subtype, as well as the use of the same manufacturing process for both the currently li censed seasonal influenza vaccines and the OVRR - Page 5 Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-3 Filed 10/28/09 Page 6 of 8Regulatory Memorandum September 15, 2009 pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccines, it is scientifically valid to extrapolate the safety and effectiveness data supporting licensure of the seasonal vaccines to support approval of strain change supplements for the vaccine s against pandemic (H1N1) 2009. In addition, licensure of a supplemental monovalent 2009 H1N1 is consistent with past regulatory actions as previously stated above. Because H1N1 vaccine strains have been incorporated in influenza vaccines for human use for decades, the regulatory pathway for licensure of the unadjuvanted, monovalent2009 (H1N1) virus vaccine should follow that of seasonal H1N1 vaccines. In addition, FDA's guidance entitled \"Clinical Data Needed to Support the Licensure of Pandemic Influenza Vaccines\" (May 2007) s uggests that submission of a BLA, as opposed to a BLA supplement, may be benefici al for the agency as it addresses trade name and labeling matters concerning the pandemic vaccine. These are important issues to be addressed; however, it is not the case that their reso lution requires submission of a separate BLA. The proper names Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine and Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine Li ve, Intranasal have been assigned to these vaccines to distinguish them from th e trivalent seasonal vaccines. In 1986 the supplemental vaccine was assigned a unique proper name (Influenza Virus Vaccine, Monovalent, Type A) to distingu ish it from the licensed trival ent vaccine. Submission of a BLA supplement should not be an impediment to tracking and differentiating postmarketing adverse events for monovale nt pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine versus licensed trivalent vaccine. Post distribution surveillance for adverse events associated with monovalent vaccine use will be performed. Currently, the expectation is that events will be detected and evaluated using a number of systems including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to detect signals, as well as the Vaccine Safety Data (VSD) Link and collaborations wi th other data base systems such as the Department of Defense to detect signals and evaluate events associated with use. Lastly, FDA's guidance on Submitting Separate Marketing Applicat ions and Clinical Data for Purposes of Assessing User Fees , (December 2004) commonly referred to as \"the bundling policy\" does not preclude the st rain change supplement approach to the licensure of unadjuvanted, monovalent pa ndemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccines by licensed manufacturers of seasonal influenza vaccine s. This guidance was intended to explain what changes that required supporting clinical data could be grouped together in a single submission that would be assessed a single user fee as opposed to being reported in multiple submissions requiring multiple user fees. It also provides criteria to determine whether a change is more appropriately considered an efficacy supplement or a new application. The guidance does not appear to distinguish between efficacy supplements and Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (C MC) supplements, which are not assessed a user fee. Supplements for strain changes to the seasonal Influenza vaccines have been, and continue to be, considered CMC supplements. V. CSL LIMITED'S INFLUENZA A (H1N1) 2009 MONO VALENT VACCINE As described above, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viru s belongs to the same influenza A H1N1 subtype as included in the currently licensed seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine Afluria.

II II The e tent of global disease du development and timely deployment of v accine. FDA has considered applicable regulatory options to facilitate the licen sure of unadjuvanted, monovalent vaccines against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. These options only pertain to unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccines manuf actured using the same processe used for currently U.S. licensed trivalent seas onal vaccines and formulated to contain the same quantity of antigen as a single strain of the seasonal vaccine: OVRR - Page 1 Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-4 Filed 10/28/09 Page 2 of 8Regulatory Memorandum September 15, 2009 (i) BLA strain change supplement without clinical data at the time of submission. The immunogenicity data from ongoing cl inical trials would be submitted post- licensure as a clinical efficacy supplement. (ii) BLA or BLA strain ch ange supplement containing limited clinical data such as post-dose one immunogenicity data from on- going clinical studies. The post-dose 2 immunogenicity data would be submitted post-licensure. (iii) BLA with complete clinical dataset, i.e., submission of a BLA when clinical studies evaluating immunoge nicity and safety following two doses of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine are completed. OVRR discussed these options with FDA seni or management including Drs. Margaret Hamburg, Jesse Goodman, Mary Lou Valdez and Murray Lumpkin on June 5, 2009. On July 10, 2009, representatives from FDA briefed staff from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and other Agencies within DHHS on these licensure issues during a meeting attended by, among others, HHS Chief of Staff Laura Petrou, ASPR Dr. Nicole Lurie, Dr. Bruce Gellin (NVPO) a nd Dr. Anthony Fauci (NIAID). FDA noted that in the case of an urgent public hea lth need for a pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccine, option (i) above, i.e., submission of a BLA strain change supplement without clinical data at the time of submission, provi des the most expeditious regulatory pathway to licensure among the legally permissible options . Furthermore, this option is consistent with previous FDA regulatory decisi ons concerning influenza vaccines. On July 23, 2009, FDA presented this licensu re strategy to the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) for discussion and received unanimous support from the VRBPAC me mbers for licensure of unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza v accines as strain change supplements. II b. Characteristics of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Virus: The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus belongs to the same influenza A H1N1 subtype as those present in currently licensed seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines . Influenza A virus H1N1 subtypes have circulated globa lly from at least the mid-1930s until 1957, reappeared in 1977 and have since caused influenza disease in the United States 2009 are antigenically distinct from previous seasonal influenza A (H1N1) human isolates, they are similar to classical swine A (H1N1) viruses and North Ameri can A (H1N1) viruses that circ ulated in swine in the US over the last decade, and that have occasionally infected humans during the same period (Garten et al, Sciencexpress / www.sciencexpress.org / 22 May 2009/Page 1/10.1126/science.1176225 ). The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus does not present a change in influenza A subtype, even though it has a unique genome composition not identified previously, based on nucleotid e sequencing and phyl ogenetic analysis. (N 8-4 Filed 10/28/09 Page 3 of 8Regulatory Memorandum September 15, 2009 II c. Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Strain Change Supplements: Gradual antigenic change in the influenza vi rus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens requires annual assessment of in fluenza vaccine strains as well as annual administration of the trivalent seasonal influe nza vaccine. Therefore, each year FDA and the VRBPAC consider the optimal strains for in clusion in the seasonal trivalent vaccines. Following strain selection ma nufacturers submit strain change supplements to their license applications. Each new inactivated seasonal vaccine (Influenza Virus Vaccine) made by currently licensed influenza v accine manufacturers is licensed without additional clinical data specific for the new strain(s). Each new live influenza virus vaccine (Influenza Vaccine Live, Intranas al) is evaluated in approximately 300 individuals prior to approval to verify adequate attenuation. Safety and effectiveness of each new seasonal vaccine are extrapolated fr om data included in the approved license application as well as the post-marketing experience with preceding seasonal vaccines. Approved dosing regimens for seasonal trivalen t vaccine for children and adults usually remain unchanged for strain change supplem ents and are based on clinical studies performed in the 1970s that demonstrated that children and adults unexposed to influenza either through natural infec tion or vaccination required two doses of inactivated vaccine to achieve acceptable antibody levels while pe rsons with pre-existing immunity required a single dose ( Plotkin and Orenstein 4th edition, p. 350 ). Moreover, among adults, studies have indicated limited or no improve ment in antibody response when a second dose is administered during the same season ( Gross et al. J Clin Microbiol Med Levine et suggests that these indi viduals are immunologically primed to respond adequately to a single dos e of vaccine formulated with an influenza subtype that is closely related to previous subtypes.. II d. Unadjuvanted, Monovalent, Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Virus Vaccines Strain Change Supplements: Manufacturers of licensed seasonal influenza vacc ines file a manufacturing strain change supplement to their existing BLA for the tr ivalent seasonal vaccine. The unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus va ccine will be manufactured using the licensed process and will be considered a strain change. Consistent with the data required for the seasonal vaccine strain change , clinical safety and immunogenicity data at the time of licensure will not be required for an inactivated unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine. For unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 live virus vaccine, as is the case with th e seasonal live attenuate d influenza vaccine, limited clinical safety data will be provided prior to licensure. Safety and effectiveness of each monovalent vaccine is extrapolated from data included in the approved seasonal license application as well as the post-mark eting experience with seasonal vaccines. Each strain change supplement for pande mic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine will reference the nonclinical, chemistry, manufactur ing, and controls (CMC) info rmation and clinical data in the original approved BLA for trivalent influenza vaccine. Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics has initiated c linical studies with monovale nt Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Vaccine to determine the optimal dosage, numbe r of doses and schedule. These data will OVRR - Page 3 Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-4 Filed 10/28/09 Page 4 of 8Regulatory Memorandum September 15, 2009 be submitted to each license appl ication as clinical efficacy s upplements after approval of the strain change supplements. Although pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus belongs to the same influenza H1N1 subtype currently included in licensed seasonal trival ent influenza vaccines, data suggest that children 6 months to 9 years of age are la rgely serologically na \u00efve to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus (MMWR 2009; 58(19) 521-5 24). Based on these data, children 9 years of age and younger should be administered 2 doses of the monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine. Available data indicates that among adults some degree of pre-existing immunity to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus exists, especially among those aged >60 years. Based on data from seasona l influenza vaccines we expect individuals 10 to 17 years of age to respond similarly to adults, so individuals 10 years of age and older should be administered 1 dose of monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine. This dosing regimen, in which immunologically na\u00efve persons receive 2 doses and primed individuals receive one dose is similar to that used for seasonal influenza vaccines. Licensed unadjuvanted, monovalent pandemi c (H1N1) 2009 vaccine would be labeled for use in the same populations as the resp ective seasonal trivalent vaccine. Thus, only those manufacturers with a currently licensed seasonal vaccine for use in children could obtain licensure of vaccine for active immunization against influenza disease caused by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in that population. III. REGULATORY PRECEDENT FO R LICENSURE OF A MONOVALENT VACCINE AS A STRAIN CHANGE SUPPLEMENT Before 1978 influenza vaccines were monovale nt and bivalent; since 1978, most US licensed influenza vaccines have been trival ent incorporating infl uenza A (H1N1), and A (H3N2) subtype viruses and an influenza B virus ( Fukuda, K., et al in Plotkin, Vaccines 4 th Edition, Elsevier, p. 349 ).

Clinical data were not submitted to FDA concerning these supplemental vaccines. IV. FDA GUIDANCE CONCERNING TH E LICENSURE OF PANDEMIC VACCINES FDA has issued guidance concerning the licensure of pandemic vaccines. To the extent that the strain change supplement approach to licensure is not specifically described in such guidance it is important to note the followi ng distinctions between the current public health emergency (as declared under secti on 319 of the Public H ealth Service Act) concerning disease caused by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus and the factual assumptions behind previous FDA guidance.

Medical contraindication sh all continue until such immunization is found no longer to be detrimental to the individual's health. Nationally rec ognized up-to-date guidance for medical contraindications and recommendati ons for vaccination(s) for influenza will be posted on the New York State Department of H ealth immunization page website and will be updated regularly. (b) \"Personnel\" means all persons employed or aff iliated with a healthcare facility, whether paid or unpaid, including but not limited to employees, members of the me dical staff, contract staff, students, and volunteers, who either have direct contact with patie nts or whose activities are such that if they were infected with influenza, they could potentially expose patients, or others who have direct contact with patient s, to influenza; provided, however , that the provisions of this subpart shall not apply to those individuals employed or affiliated with a facility that have neither direct contact with patients nor activities that c ould potentially expose patients or others who have direct contact with pa tients. This shall include, but not be limited to, any individual whose (i) job site is physically separated from patient care lo cations, and who has no direct contact with patients; an d (ii) job activities would result in no more than infrequent and/or incidental direct contact with ot hers who might have direct contact with patients; provided, that such direct contact is unlikely to transmit influenza. Examples include, but are not limited to, administrative, data entry, and building or propert y maintenance functions that meet the criteria of items (i) and (ii). 2Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 3 of 30(c) \"Health Care Facilities\" incl ude general hospitals as define d in section 2801 of the Public Health Law, diagnostic and treatment centers as defined in section 751.1 of part 751 of this Title, certified home health agencies, long term home health care progr ams, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) home care programs and licensed home care services agencies as defined in section 3602 of the Public Health Law, and hospices as defined in section 4002 of the Public Health Law. Section 66 - 3.2 - Health care facility - pers onnel influenza immunization requirements Every health care facility in this state shall no tify all personnel of the requirement and require that personnel be immunized ag ainst influenza virus(es) as a precondition to employment and on an annual basis. Such influenza vaccination( s) must be in accordance with the national recommendations in effect at the time of vacci nation(s), unless the commissioner has determined that there is not an adequate supply of vaccine. If the commissioner determines the vaccine supplies are not adequate given th e numbers of personnel to be v accinated or vaccine(s) are not reasonably available, the commissioner may susp end the requirement(s) to vaccinate and/or change the annual deadline fo r such vaccination(s), as established in this subpart. Section 66 - 3.3 - Health care facility requirements, existing personnel Each health care facility must pr ovide or arrange for influenza vaccination(s), at no cost to its personnel, either at the facility or elsewher e. Personnel may choose to receive influenza vaccination(s) from a source other than that arranged for by the facility and provide documentation to the facility as described in Section 66 - 3.5. Annual influenza vaccination(s) and the documentation thereof shall take place no later than November thirtieth of each year. 3Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 4 of 30 66 - 3.4 - Health care facility requirements, new personnel Personnel newly entering into service at a facility after November thirtieth but before April first of each year shall have his or her status for in fluenza vaccination(s) determined by the facility and, if found to be deficient, the facility shall pr ovide or arrange for the necessary vaccination(s) at no cost to the new personnel. Instead of obt aining influenza vaccination(s) from the facility, personnel may choose to receive influenza vaccination(s) from a source other than that arranged for by the facility and provide documen tation as described in Section 66 - 3.5. Section 66 - 3.5 - Documentation The health care facility shall document the annua l vaccination(s) against influenza virus of all personnel in their personnel files, including the date , site of administration, type of vaccine, dose, manufacturer and lot number of the vaccine, re actions if any, vaccine information statement given, and the name of the person administering the vaccines. If any personnel receive influenza vaccination(s) from other than facility staff, the facility shall document in the personnel file the date, type of vaccine, dose and name of the person administering the vaccine. Section 66 - 3.6 - Exceptions No personnel shall be required to receive an influenza vaccine if the vaccine is medically contraindicated for that indivi dual. Nationally recognized up-t o-date guidance for medical contraindications and recommendations for vacci nation(s) for influenza will be posted on the New York State Department of Health immunization page website and will be updated regularly. The facility shall, on a case-by- case basis, evaluate what step s those who are not vaccinated pursuant to this section must take to reduce the risk of transmitting influenza to patients. 4Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 5 of 30 Section 66 - 3.7 - Reporting Requirements Each facility shall collect aggr egate data on personnel influenza vaccination(s) status for the period beginning April first and ending March thirty-f irst of each year and report that data to the department by May first of the same year in a manner determined by the commissioner.

Paragraph (6) of subdivision (d) of Secti on 793.5 is added to read as follows: (6) documentation of preemployment and annual vacci nation(s) against influenza, in accordance with Part 66 of this Title. 6Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 7 of 30REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT Statutory Authority: The authority for the promulgation of the regulatory changes adding Subpart 66-3 and amending Sections 405.3, 751.6, 766.11 and 793.5 of Title 10 is contained in Sections 2803 (2), 3612 and 4010 (4) of the Public Health Law (PHL). PHL section 2800 places the comprehensive responsibility for the development and administration of the state's policy with respect to Article 28 facilities with the State Depa rtment of Health. PHL Secti on 2803(2) authorizes the State Hospital Review and Planning Council (SHRPC) to adopt and amend rules and regulations, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, to implement the purposes and provisions of PHL Article 28, and to establish minimum standards gove rning the operation of health care facilities. PHL Section 3612 authorizes the SHRPC to adopt and amend rules and regulations, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, with respect to certified home health agencies, providers of long term home health care programs and provide rs of AIDS home care programs. PHL Section 4010 (4) authorizes the SHRPC to adopt and amend rules and regula tions, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, with resp ect to hospice organizations. Legislative Objectives: The legislative objective of PH L Article 28 includes the protection of the health of the residents of the State by assuring the efficient provision and proper utilization of health services, of the highest quality at a reas onable cost. PHL Article 36 stat es a public commitment to the appropriate provision and expansion of services rendered to the resi dents of the State by certified home health agencies, to the maintenance of a consistently high level of services by all home care services agencies, to the central collec tion and public accessibility of information 7Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 8 of 30concerning all organized home car e services, and to the adequate regulation and coordination of existing home care services. PHL Article 40 declares that hospice is a socially and financially beneficial alternative to conven tional curative care for those aff licted by terminal illness. In recognition of the value of hospice and consistent with State po licy to encourage the expansion of health care service options available to New Yo rk State residents, it is the intention of the Legislature that hospice be availa ble to all who seek such care and that it become a permanent component of the State's health care system. Immunizing staff of these providers against influenza will promote the health and safety of the patients they se rve and support efficient provision of services. Needs and Benefits: The State Department of Health strongly a dvocates that all hea lth care personnel (HCP) should receive annual influenza vaccination(s). This recommendation was communicated in two letters from the Commissioner (dated October 2006 and September 2007), and a health advisory (dated December 14, 2007), sent to hospitals, long te rm care facilities, providers and local health departments. PHL Article 21-A, the Long Te rm Care Resident and Employee Immunization Act, currently requires that all long-term care facilities, adult homes, adult day healthcare facilities, and enriched housing programs offer influenza vaccine to all employees and residents. Further amendments to PHL Article 21-A have been introduced to require all HCP under its purview to receive annual influenza vaccination(s). The intent of this regulation is to coordinate the influenza vaccination requirements for personnel in Article 28, Artic le 36, and Article 40 entities to be the same; however, each type of 8Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 9 of 30entity has a separate set of regulations that apply to them. In order to avoid the need to revise multiple regulations in the event of future chan ges to Subpart 66-3, the regulations for each type of provider entity will re fer to one central set of requirement s in Part 66. The authority for the Part 66-3 regulation, as applying to the affected types of faciliti es, rests with the State Hospital Review and Planning Council. Each year, influenza causes significant morb idity and mortality in the United States, especially among the vulnerable populations in ho spitals and long term ca re facilities. Common symptoms include the sudden onset of headache, high fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue and body aches. Complications of influenza may include bacterial or viral pneumonia; dehydration; the worsening of chronic medical condi tions, such as congestive heart fa ilure, asthma, or diabetes; or death. The risk for complications, hospitaliza tion, and death from infl uenza are higher among persons 65 years of age or older, young childre n, and persons with chronic medical conditions. Influenza is the sixth leading cause of death amo ng adults in the United States, killing an average of 36,000 Americans annually and causing more d eaths than all other vaccine-preventable diseases combined. Influenza viruses spread main ly from person to person when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. Most healthy adults, including HCP, may be able to infect others beginning 1-2 days before symptoms develop and up to 5 days after becoming sick. That means HCP may be able to pass on the disease to a patient befo re they are aware they are sick or they may continue to work while they are contagious. 9Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 10 of 30Influenza Infections in Hospital s and Long Term Care Facilities. Tables 1 and 2 detail the burden of nosocomial influenza infections (i.e., influenza infections acquired in hospitals and long term care facilities) in New York Stat e by using NYSDOH surveillance data from 2001 to 2006. During the 2005-06 influenza season, there were 205 confirmed outbreaks in New York State hospitals and long-term car e facilities. There were 1,896 su spected and confirmed cases of influenza associated with these reported outbreak s. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the number of outbreaks and cases varies significa ntly year to year depending on the severity of that year's influenza season.

Role of HCP in Influenza Transmission. Influenza transmission and outbreaks in hospitals and nursing homes are well documented. HCP can acqui re influenza from infected patients or the community and transmit influenza to patients an d other staff. Many HCP develop no or only mild symptoms of the disease a nd, therefore, do not re alize they have influenza and can transmit the disease to patients. Since influenza can be transmitted 1-2 days before the onset of symptoms, patients are at risk even if HCP do stay at home while ill. A few studies provide estimates of the inci dence of influenza-lik e illness among HCP. According to the CDC, \"In one serosurvey of HCP, 23% had doc umented serologic evidence of influenza infection after a mild influenza season ; however, of these, 59% could not recall having influenza, and 28% could not recall any respir atory infection, suggestin g a high proportion of asymptomatic illness.\" In addition, multiple studie s have also shown that HCP continue to work despite being ill with influenza, increasing e xposure of patients and coworkers. When HCP 11Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 12 of 30come in to work while ill, whether it is because th ey do not want to lose si ck time or pay or out of a sense of obligation, influenza virus can be transmitted to patients and other staff. Studies have shown that influenza outbreaks in health facilities are associated with low vaccination rates among HCP and that, convers ely, high vaccinati on rates among HCP are associated with fewer outbreaks. One study looke d at the yearly incide nce of lab-confirmed influenza illness among both staff and patients over 12 influenza seasons in an acute care facility, from 1999-2000. As the influenza vaccine rate climbed from 4% to 67%, the proportion of influenza cases decreased among hospitalized patients from 32% to 0, and among staff from 42% to 9%. Influenza outbreaks in long-term care f acilities are common and can cause severe outcomes in the vulnerable resident populations . Older adults in nursing homes often have multiple chronic or acute conditions that make them particularly susceptible to the complications of influenza disease. The intimate and constant care that is required by residents from the HCP who care for them allows for ready transmissibility from symptomatic or asymptomatic infected staff members. In addition, because influenza vacc ination(s) is/are less effective among frail and elderly patients, outbreaks can occur in facilities where a high proportion of residents or patients are immunized. High vaccination levels of HCP ar e needed to protect patients, making influenza vaccination(s) of HCP an important patient safety issue. A Scottish study compared mortality rates betw een long-term care hospitals that offered influenza vaccination to HCP, where 51% were vaccinated, and hospitals that did not, where 12Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 13 of 30only 5% were vaccinated. The result was near ly a 40% reduction in all-cause mortality among the patients cared for by HCP in the hospitals wi th higher levels of HCP influenza vaccination. Yet, despite the documented and positive effects of immunizing HCP against influenza on patient outcomes, HCP absenteeism, and re ducing influenza infection among staff, and incentives to promote vaccination(s) of HCP, 30-50% continues to remain unvaccinated. In 2000, New York State enacted Public He alth Law Article 21- A requiring long-term care facilities to offer influenza vaccine to all residents and HCP and to document refusal of the vaccine. As seen in NYSDOH survey data, wh ile the overall vaccinati on of residents has improved to 80% or greater in most facilities, the response am ong HCP has been poor (less than 45%). CDC and National Recommendations. Recognizing the need to protect hospital patients and long-term care facil ity residents, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended influenza vaccination(s) for health care personnel (HCP) since 1981. In November 2003, 24 leading organizations endorsed a policy to make annual influenza vaccination(s) among HCP an important goal for pub lic health and safety. These organizations included the Society for Hospital Epidemiology of America, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Practitioners, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Nurses Association. 13Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 14 of 30In February 2006, the Healthcare Infecti on Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) jointly recommended that all HCP be vaccinated annually against influenza. In January 2007, the Infectious Disease Society of America called for a mandatory requirement for all HCP to receiv e influenza vaccination yearly. Costs for the Implementation of and Continuing Compliance with these Regulations to the Regulated Entity The cost to regulated entiti es to vaccinate personnel s hould be modest. Personnel in hospitals, diagnostic and treatment centers, home care services agencies and hospices all must undergo a health assessment to ensure that such personnel are free from a health impairment which is a potential risk to patients or whic h may interfere with the performance of his/her duties. Personnel are also required to have a certificate of vaccination against measles and rubella unless medically contraindicated and be tested for tubercul osis as condition of employment or affiliation. It should be noted that measles and rubella are one-time vaccinations, while influenza vaccination(s) is /are given annually. Many, if not most, facilities recognize the importance of their personnel receiving such vaccin ation(s) and already offer it to them, usually at no charge. Influenza vaccine is one of the least expensive vaccines and the average price in the private sector ranges from a pproximately $9.75 to $19.70 per dose. Any additional costs to vaccinate all personnel should be more than offset by cost savings to the facility. Cost-effectiveness studies of a dults aged <65 years indi cate that vaccination(s) can reduce both direct medical co sts and indirect costs from work absenteeism, resulting in 13%- 14Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 15 health-care provider visits, 18%-45% fewer lost workdays, 18%-28% fewer days working with reduced effectiveness, and a 25% decrease in antibiotic use for influenza-like illness (ILI). HCP absenteeism can be a serious cause of staffing shortages during the influenza season at a time when emergency room visits and admissions due to influenza-related illness are greatly increased. The benefit of an immunized staff decreases direct and indirect costs to health care facilities. Before 12/1/09, for inpatient hospital reimburse ment, flu costs incurred prior to 12/1/09 may be the subject of a rate appeal per 10 NYCRR 86-1.17(a)(3). Section 86-1.17(a)(3) permits application for prospective revisi ons of certified rates and establis hed revenue caps in the current year based on \"[D]ocumented in creases in the overall operating costs of a medical facility resulting from the implementation of additiona l or expanded programs, staff or services specifically mandated for the faci lity by the commissioner.\" Afte r that time, the new hospital reimbursement system, PHL section 2807-c, subd ivision 35 (added by section 2 of Part C, Chapter 58 of the Laws of 2009) permits very limited rate appeals, as noted in PHL 2807-c (35)(b)(x). Reimbursement for certified home health agencies (CHHA) is set forth in 10 NYCRR 86-1.46. This is not impacted by the ne w subdivision 35. Consequently, CHHA rate appeals based on new DOH mandated servic es may continue to be available. For long-term home health care progra ms, reimbursement is found in Subpart 86-5 of 10 NYCRR and section 86-5.14(a)(3) a nd permits the commissioner to consider applications for revision of certified rates which are based on \"significant increases in the overall 15Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 16 of 30operating costs of the long term home health car e program resulting from the implementation of additional programs, staff or services sp ecifically mandated for the program by the commissioner.\" Diagnostic and treatment centers (D&TC) rates were scheduled to move to a new system (APGs) on March 1, 2009, but the tr ansition has not occurred due to a delay in federal approval of state plan amendments. In the interim, 10 NYCRR 86-4.16(c) would continue to permit D&TC rate appeals based on new mandates. Cost to State and Local Government: The regulatory requirements are not expected to result in costs to state or local governments. Potential savings to Medicaid and other payors are expected by decreasing influenza cases. Among healthy persons aged 18- 64 years, vaccination(s) can save an estimated $60-$4,000 per illness, depending on the cost of v accination(s), the influe nza attack rate, and vaccine effectiveness against influenza-like illness (ILI). In another economic analysis, vaccination(s) resulted in an average annual cost savings of $13.66 per person vaccinated; however, other analyses have not demonstrat ed cost savings. Among studies of healthy young adults, >70% of the costs prevented were associat ed with reductions in lost work productivity. The estimated annual direct cost of influenza infection in the United States is estimated to be between 3 and 5 billion dollars. In the event that medical f acilities and long-term home health care programs seek a timely medicaid rate change and it is approved, th e state and local government may have to pay a proportion of the amount approved, with the fede ral government contributing the balance. 16Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 17 of 30However, due to the medicaid cap imposed on the c ounty share, it is impossible at this time to calculate whether local governments will in fact have to contribute any funds to meet this potential expense. Cost to the Department of Health: Minimal new costs to the New York State Department of Health {NYSDOH) will be incurred associated with enactment of these re gulations. By decreasing HCP influenza disease and absenteeism, and the spread of influenza disease among patients, the qua lity of health care should be improved, as well as patient outcomes. NYSDOH has dedicated multiple resources to promote voluntary HCP vaccination(s) programs in public health and private arenas, including hospitals, clinics, and local health organizations over the past decade. As previously mentioned, the standard for care in New York State is that all HCP should receive annual infl uenza vaccination(s). This recommendation was sent to all New York State hospitals, long-term care facilities, providers and local health departments, via two Commissioner letters (d ated October 2006 and September 2007), and a Health Advisory (December 14, 2007). Other initia tives to promote this practice have included educational materials, toolkits, a department-w ide workgroup, outreach to healthcare partners, and public service announcements. These initiatives will continue. Any additional costs will be associated with increased oversight of compliance with the regulatory requirements. NYSDOH already collects data from long-term care facilities on an annual basis to monitor compliance with PHL Ar ticle 21-A. Long-term care facilities must submit an annual report (DOH form 4193) to NYSDOH by May 1 providing information on the 17Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 18 of 30number of residents and employees who received and the number who did not receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccine during the previous year. This form will be modified to capture data from additional health care facilities. Additiona l costs will mostly involve the additional data collection, analysis, written report s and follow-up with facilities. Local Government Mandates: There are no local government mandates in New York Stat e related to this proposal, except as they apply to providers op erated by local government entities. Paperwork: PHL Article 21-A, the New York State Long-Term Care Resident and Employee Immunization Act, requires nursing homes, adult car e facilities, enriched housing facilities, and adult day health care programs in New York St ate to document their vaccination efforts and to submit an annual report to NYSDOH. The facil ity annual report was historically completed using DOH form 4193. This form is now availabl e on the Health Provider Network (HPN). The form will be modified to capture hospitals, diagnostic and treatment centers, home care and hospice programs. Those entities covered by th ese regulations will be required to submit vaccination information using the Health Commerce System. All reporting will be accomplished using the internet only. Duplication: This proposal does not duplicate any state or federal regulation. 18Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 19 Voluntary programs to increase HCP influen za vaccination rates have not resulted in adequate vaccination levels. For the past decade, the New York State Department of Health has dedicated multiple resources to promote voluntary HCP vaccination programs in public health and private arenas, including hospi tals, clinics, and local health organizations. Initiatives have included educational materials, toolkits, a de partment-wide workgroup, outreach to healthcare partners, and public service announcements. However, these programs have failed to substantially increase HCP vaccination rates. On April 1, 2000, Article 21-A, the Long- Term Care Resident and Employee Immunization Act, was added to the Public Hea lth Law. This law requires nursing homes, adult homes, enriched housing programs, and adult day health care programs to provide or arrange for influenza vaccination(s) for all residents and employees every y ear. The law also requires these types of facilities to provide or arrange for pneumococcal vaccination(s) for all residents and employees for whom the vaccine is recomm ended according to guidelines issued by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Residents and employees may refuse vaccination(s) due to medical cont raindication, religious objection, or by choice after being fully informed of the health benefits and risks of such action. These long-term care facilities must document vaccination status of residents and em ployees, including refusal of vaccination(s) and the reasons for refusal. In 2001, NYSDOH began collecting data from long-term care facilities to monitor compliance with PHL Article 21-A. Long-term care facilities must submit an annual report 19Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 20 of 30(DOH form 4193) to NYSDOH by May 1 providing in formation on the number of residents and employees who received and the number that did not receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccine during the previous year. Even the en actment of NYS PHL Article 21-A targeting long- term care facilities has failed to promote consistent HCP vaccination rates above 44%. A requirement for vaccination(s) is not unique to influenza. Childhood vaccination rates vastly improved in the US, often exceeding 90-9 5%, once mandatory school-entry vaccination requirements were put into place. In health care settings, measles and rubella vaccination has also been successful in achieving nearly univers al vaccination of health employees against these pathogens. Consequently, requi ring influenza vaccination(s) fo r health care workers would similarly be highly effective and, perhaps with additional education, widely accepted. Federal Requirements: There are no minimum standard s established by the federal g overnment for the same or similar subject areas. Compliance Schedule: This proposal will go into effect upon filing with the Secretary of State. Contact Person: Ms. Katherine E. Ceroalo NYS Department of Health Bureau of House Counsel, Regulatory Affairs Unit Corning Tower Building, Room 2438 Empire State Plaza Page 21 of 30 REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS FOR SMALL BUSINESS A ND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS Effect of Rule: Any facility defined as a hospital pursuant to PHL Article 28, as a home care services agency by PHL Article 36, or hospice by PHL Ar ticle 40 will be required to comply. Small businesses (defined as 100 employees or less) , independently owned and operated, affected by this rule will include: 3 ho spitals, 237 diagnostic and trea tment centers, 91 nursing homes, 252 certified home health agencies, and approxima tely 900 licensed home care services agencies. There are 50 certified hospices in New York State; most of them would f it into the category of a small business, but definitive data concerning their small business status is not available. Compliance Requirements: All facilities must document the preemployment and annual vaccination(s) for influenza virus, subject to the availability of an adequate supply of the necessary vaccine and subject to exemptions for medical contraindications. Professional Services: Facilities will need to provide or arrange for influenza vaccin ation(s) of personnel. Most facilities currently offer influenza vaccinations to their personnel on a volunt ary basis. It is not anticipated that facilities will need to hire additional staff to meet this mandate. Compliance Costs: 21Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 22 of 30The cost to facilities to meet this mandate is estimated to be minimal. It is anticipated that any costs incurred to vaccinate HCP will be offset by savings in direct medical costs by reducing influenza infection among HCP and patient s, as well as savings in indirect costs associated with HCP absenteeism. Economic and Technological Feasibility: This proposal is economically and technically feasible. Minimizing Adverse Impact: There are no alternatives to the proposal to require influenza vaccination(s) of all HCP. Small Business and Local Government Participation: Outreach to the affected parties has been conducted. Such parties include professional organizations representing physicia ns, nurses, and other health care personnel, as well as general hospitals, diagnostic and treatment centers, home care agencies and hospices. The organization representing county health officers, NYSACHO, has also been briefed. Organizations that repres ent the affected parties are given no tice of this proposal by its inclusion on the agenda of the Codes and Regulations Committee of the State Hospital Review and Planning Council (SHRPC). Presentations by Department staff were also given at the full Public Health Council and State Hospital Review and Planning Council m eetings to brief Council members on this 22Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 23 of 30upcoming proposal. The public, including many affected parties, have been in attendance at these meetings. 23Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 24 of 30RURAL AREA FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS Pursuant to section 202-bb of the State Ad ministrative Procedure Act (SAPA), a rural area flexibility analysis is not required. These provisions ap ply uniformly throughout New York State, including all rural areas. The proposed rule will not impose an adverse economic impact on rural facilities defined within PHL Articles 28, 36, or 40. It will require additional documentation, record-keeping and other compliance requirements on public or privat e entities, but it is not expected to adversely affect rural areas. 24Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 25 of 30JOB IMPACT STATEMENT A Job Impact Statement is not included in accordance with Section 201-a (2) of the State Administrative Procedure Act (SAPA), because it will not have a substantial adverse effect on jobs and employment opportunities. 25Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 26 of 30EMERGENCY ADOPTION JUSTIFICATION Transmission of influenza disease from health care personnel to patie nts is a serious and significant patient safety issue because influenza disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients and those adm itted to other types of h ealth care facilities. This fact, plus the new threat posed to health and safety by the novel H1N1 influenza A strain that is circulating in New York State, puts a need for emergency regulations requiring that all health care personnel (HCP) be immunized agai nst influenza annually into focus for the upcoming influenza season. Yearly, a significant threat to the health of patients, HCP themselves, and local communities exists that will be magnified in the upcoming season by the ongoing pandemic. The sooner that the emergency re gulations are in plac e the sooner lives will be saved and other complications of influenza disease avoided. Each year, influenza causes significant morb idity and mortality in the United States, especially among the vulnerable populations in ho spitals and other health care facilities. Complications of influenza may include bact erial or viral pneumoni a; dehydration; the worsening of chronic medical condi tions, such as congestive heart fa ilure, asthma, or diabetes; or death. The risk for complications, hospitaliza tion, and death from infl uenza are higher among persons 65 years of age or older, young childre n, and persons with chronic medical conditions. Influenza is the sixth leading cause of death amo ng adults in the United States, killing an average of 36,000 Americans annually and causing more d eaths than all other vaccine-preventable diseases combined. Recognizing the need to protect patients, th e Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended influenza vaccination for HCP since 1981. In February 2006, the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) and the Advisory 26Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 27 of 30Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) jointly recommended that all HCP be vaccinated annually against influenza. In addition, the Infecti ous Disease Society of Am erica, the Society of Hospital Epidemiologist of America, the Ameri can Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Practitioners, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Association of Perioperative Nurses, the American Nurses Association, and mu ltiple individual health care institutions have all supported and called for all HCP to receive influenza immunization ye arly. Facilities that employ HCP have been strongly en couraged to provide vaccine to their staff by using evidence- based approaches that maximize the use of influenza vaccination. Yet, despite the documented and positive effects of immunizing HCP against influenza on patient outcomes, HCP absenteeism, and reduc ing influenza infection among staff, and the fact that influenza transmission and outbreaks in healthcare facilities are well documented, national vaccination coverage ra tes among HCP continue to rema in low, at around 42%. Even among health care centers utilizing highly organize d and aggressive campaigns and incentives to promote immunization of HCP, 30-50% continue to remain unvaccinated. In 2000, New York State enacted Public Health Law Article 21A requiring long term care facilities to offer influenza vaccine to all residents and HCP and to document refusal of the vaccine. As seen in New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) survey data, while the overall vaccination of residents has improved to 80% or greater in most facili ties, the response among HCP has been poor. Because of the serious consequences of nos ocomial influenza outbreaks, as well as the impact on health care workers and the economic im pact on health care systems, it is imperative that action be taken to ensure high health care worker vaccination rates. HCP absenteeism can result in serious staffing shortages during the in fluenza season, at a time when emergency room visits and admissions due to influenza-related il lness are greatly increased. The benefit of an immunized staff decreases direct and indirect cost s to health care facilities. The United States 27Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 28 of 30and New York State are enteri ng the 2009-2010 influenza season this Fall facing an emergency situation, with the potential circulation of both seasonal influe nza viruses and the pandemic novel H1N1 influenza strain. Health care resource s will be strained to the breaking point while addressing the burden of treating la rge numbers of patient s ill with influenza. HCP need to be protected so that they will not become ill, tran smit influenza to patients, their families and their communities, and also so that the health care system can be preserved and not collapse due to high degrees of HCP absenteeism. The urgenc y of this situation necessitates immediate emergency regulatory action to allow sufficient time for hospitals to arrange for the purchase and administration of influenza vaccine for the upcomi ng influenza season. This will also give health care facilities time to prepare for an extended novel H1N1 influenza vaccination campaign, in tandem with seasonal vaccination efforts. Immunizing the staff of health care facilities against influenza will promote the health and safety of the patients they serve and suppor t efficient provision of services during the pandemic. The NYSDOH has strongly and continuously advocated that all HCP should receive annual influenza vaccination(s). Annual influen za morbidity and mortalit y necessitates requiring influenza vaccination of all HCP in hospitals a nd other health care faci lities on an emergency basis, so that lives can be saved. This is an even more urgent imperative during the current novel H1N1 influenza pandemic. Summary of Key Points The burden of influenza disease is very high in health care facilities and will increase due to the current pandemic. 28Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 29 of 30 29 Influenza vaccination of HCP is a patient and community safety issue and protects vulnerable hospitalized patients during s easonal influenza seasons and during the pandemic. HCP need to be vaccinated to control influenza in health care facili ties even if patient vaccination rates are high. During the pandemic, it may be recommended th at HCP receive influenza vaccination as the first line of prot ection of the public. Seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination can be cost saving to health care facilities by decreasing absenteeism, improving patie nt outcomes, decreasing error rates, increasing quality of care, and decreasing personal and organizat ional expenditures. Voluntary programs to increase HCP influen za immunization rates ha ve not resulted in adequate immunization levels. Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-5 Filed 10/28/09 Page 30 of 30EXHIBIT 2 of 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-7 Filed 10/28/09 Page 1 of 3 October 23, 2009 Dear Administrator: In August 2009 the State Hospital Review and Planning Council (SHRPC) adopted on an emergency basis 10 NYCRR Subpart 66-3, requiring ce rtain health care facility personnel to be vaccinated with influenza vaccines. I am writing t o inform you of my determination pursuant to Section 66-3.2 of those regulations that supplies o f seasonal and 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines are not adequate and that such vaccines are not rea sonably available. Therefore, I hereby suspend the requirement for the health care personn el to be vaccinated against both influenza viruses for the current influenza season (through A pril 1, 2010). On October 14, 2009, the Centers for Dise ase Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an update on the availability of the 2009 trivalent se asonal influenza vaccine. According to the CDC, 114 million doses of seasonal vaccine will be brought to market in the U.S. The CDC update stated that \"Because the total number of dos es that will be made this year is approximately the same as the number of doses that were actually administered last year, an increase in demand cannot be met this season.\" The Department of Health (DOH) has received numerous calls from hospitals, other regulated faci lities, county health departments and members of the public about difficulty in obtaining seasona l influenza vaccine. The national vaccine ordering website indicates that the major influenza vaccine distributors have little or no vaccine available to order. According to the CDC, manufact urers are not able to produce additional 2009 seasonal influenza vaccine. Supplies of monovalent 2009 H1N1 influenz a vaccine have become available from the federal government in the last three weeks. Federa l planning scenarios for H1N1 vaccination programs at the time SHRPC adopted Subpart 66-3 sho wed that 120 million doses of vaccine would be available by the end of October and 200 mi llion doses would be available by the end of November, almost twice the number of doses of seaso nal vaccine usually administered. More concrete projections, made available by CDC just pr ior to the opening of the federal H1N1 vaccine ordering and distribution program, estimate d a total of 52.5 million doses available by October 30 and 84.9 million doses available by Nove mber 27. However, as of this date, CDC is estimating only 27.7 million doses available by Oct ober 30 and 65.9 million doses by November 27, representing a 47% and 22% reduction respective ly. These circumstances set up a dynamic wher e health care personnel covered under the regulation might compete for vaccine with persons w ith underlying risk factors for adverse outcome of influenza infection. In a situation whe re the choice to vaccinate is between health care personnel and persons at risk, I have always h eld that patients take precedence. Maintaining the health care personnel vaccination requirement w ould delay persons in need from being vaccinated. For these reasons, I have determined t hat there will not be sufficient supplies of either vaccine to meet the intent of the regulation in the 2009-2010 influenza season. Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-7 Filed 10/28/09 Page 2 of 3 The most important consideration driving the need for the regulation requiring health care personnel influenza vaccination is patient safety. Patients in hospitals and other health care settings have the right to expect that they will no t be infected by their health care worker with a preventable disease which could be fatal. I believ e that New York's experience with mandatory influenza vaccination for health care personnel in 2009 will have a positive impact on the health of New Yorkers this year. The current emergency reg ulation mandating influenza vaccinations for health care workers will expire on November 11, 2009, and a second emergency regulation would not have the desired effect during the curren t H1N1 influenza season or the expected seasonal outbreaks expected later this year and in early 2010. Therefore, no new emergency regulations will be promulgated. Instead, the DOH i s advancing a permanent regulation requiring health care personnel in these settings to be vacci nated. Draft regulations will be published soon for a period of public comment. Sincerely, Richard F. Daines, M.D. Commissioner of Health Case 1:09-cv-01924-RBW Document 8-7 Filed 10/28/09 Page 3 of 3 "}
