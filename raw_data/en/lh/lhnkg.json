Influenza virus 1.1 Epidemiology Influenza viruses are the major cause of respiratory infection disease. They are mainly divided into four genera: influenza A, influenza B, influenza C and influenza D. Influenza A viruses (IAV) are further divided into many different subtypes on the basis of the different types of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) expressed on the virus surface [1]. To date, 18 subtypes of HA and 11 subtypes of NA have been found in humans and natural reservoirs such as wild aquatic birds and swine [2,3]. Some type A viruses may cross the species barrier and can occasionally cause pandemics in humans. Influenza B viruses are mainly circulating in humans and are divided into two different lineages, Victoria and Yamagata [4]. Annual mutations in IAV and influenza B viruses circulating in humans are correlated with annual epidemics. Influenza C viruses rarely circulate in humans, and only cause mild symptoms in children [5]. Recently, influenza D virus has been found in swine and cattle [6,7]. Annual influenza epidemics and occasional pandemics cause a big burden on human health. Annual seasonal influenza virus infection, caused by type A or type B viruses, can affect 5-10% of people worldwide, resulting in severe illness among 3-5 million people and around 290,000 to 650,000 deaths [8]. Occasional pandemics, normally caused by transmission of a novel influenza virus from the natural reservoir to humans, are often associated with high morbidity and mortality. In the last century, four pandemics happened: in 1918 (Spanish flu, H1N1), 1957 (Asian flu, H2N2), 1968 (Hong Kong flu, H3N2) and 1977 (Russian flu, H1N1). These four pandemics caused more than 50 million deaths [9]. The most recent influenza pandemic, the Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, was caused by a swine virus. It is estimated that as many as 284,500 people succumbed to this virus during the first wave of infection [10,11]. Besides that, influenza also causes considerable economic losses. It has been reported that its annual economic burden in the United States is $87.1 billion [12]. In addition, some other influenza viruses circulating in animals, such as H5N1 and H7N9, occasionally cross the species barrier and are reported to cause a high degree of mortality in humans [13]. Due to their limited transmission ability between humans, these viruses cannot cause pandemics in humans right now. However, some other reports have shown that certain mutations in the HA and polymerases of these viruses could make airborne transmission of H5N1 virus possible [14]. 1.2 Biology of influenza viruses Introduction and scope of this thesis 11 Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and are RNA viruses with a negative sense, single-stranded genome. There are eight RNA segments in IAV. These eight RNA segments encode at least 17 proteins the most prominent being: HA, NA, nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein 1 (M1), matrix protein 2 (M2), RNA polymerase acidic protein (PA), basic protein 1 (PB1), basic protein 1-F2 (PB1-F2), basic protein 2 (PB2), non-structural protein 1 (NS1), non-structural protein 2 (NS2; also known as nuclear export protein, NEP), and PA-X [15-17]. Fig 1: Structure of influenza virus. The figure represents the structure of influenza A virus with 8 RNA segments located inside the virus particle. (Figure cited from Nature Reviews (2018) 4:3). The influenza virus is normally spherical in shape, with a diameter of 80-120 nm [1,18]. The envelope of the virion is composed of an external lipid membrane, derived from infected cells. On the surface of the membrane, influenza glycoproteins such as HA and NA project like spikes. These glycoproteins are abundantly present on the virus surface. M2 protein also traverses the lipid membrane, however only with some copies [18]. Inside the virion envelope, a matrix of M1 protein encloses the viral core in which each segmented RNA together with multiple NP molecules and a single, trimeric polymerase complex (comprised of PB2, PB1 and PA proteinase) a viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex [1,19]. Like vRNPs, NS2 is also found inside the M1 matrix. PB1-F2 and NS1 are not found in viral particles and can only be found in virus-infected cells. 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 10 09-10-18 09:111Chapter 1 10 1.

This may be due to the mechanisms responsible for their evolution. As RNA viruses, viral genomes incur high mutation frequency during virus replication. Meanwhile, due to a lack of \"proofreading\" capacity of the viral RNA polymerase, these generated mutations cannot be corrected. This can result in the accumulation of these mutations in the viral genome. Some of these mutations are silent or generate stop codons. However, some may occur in the antibody binding site of a virus protein such as HA. By accumulation of these mutations, an HA protein can \"drift\" from one form to another, meaning that it cannot be recognized by influenza-specific antibodies induced by previous influenza infections or vaccinations. This mechanism for the evolution of influenza viruses is called antigenic drift [20]. The novel strains generated by antigenic drift can cause seasonal epidemics. Secondly, as a segmented RNA virus, IAV can acquire some genome segments, such as HA and NA, from a different subtype of influenza virus. When humans or animals are infected with different human and animal viruses, the gene segments of different influenza viruses can be exchanged, resulting in the generation of a 'reassorted' virus. This phenomenon is called antigenic shift [1]. If there is no pre-existing immunity in humans against this shifted strain, and the shifted strain transmits easily from human to human, it can cause a pandemic, as was the case in 2009 for the pandemic (pdm) H1N1 virus. Fig 2: Influenza antigenic drift and shift. Antigenic shift is shown by change in the RNA segments of virus, while antigenic drift is shown by change in the colour of HA head from red to green. (Figure cited from Nature Reviews (2018) 4:3). Introduction and scope of this thesis 13 2. Current influenza vaccines Vaccination is the most effective strategy to protect humans against influenza virus infection. Traditional seasonal influenza vaccines are trivalent inactivated vaccines (TIV) that cover the two circulating IAV virus strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and one influenza B strain. However, surveillance studies have reported that two antigenically distinct influenza B types circulate in the environment. They belong to the B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineages. Therefore, quadrivalent vaccines (QIV) with two A strains and two B strains are now licensed. To determine which strains of influenza virus should be used in these vaccines, the World Health Organization (WHO) has established a global influenza network to monitor the influenza viruses circulating in the world. Every February (for the northern hemisphere) and September (for the southern hemisphere), influenza virus strains are reviewed to detect the virus strains circulating at that time. Based on the strains circulating, the WHO tries to predict the strains which are likely to circulate in the next influenza season. After prediction, these selected strains are cultured in fertilized chicken eggs for seasonal vaccine preparation. It takes months for these new vaccines to be available for humans. Licensed influenza vaccines are predominantly classified into two different groups: inactivated influenza vaccines and live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV). Inactivated influenza vaccines include whole inactivated virus, subunit, split, virosome and virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines. Whole inactivated influenza virus vaccine (WIV), produced by the inactivation of live influenza virus, was the first influenza vaccine used in humans [21]. Because of the side effects induced by WIV, it has been abandoned since the advent of split and subunit vaccines [22]. Improvements in the production and purification of WIV have decreased WIV-induced side effects, making this vaccine acceptable for use again. Split and subunit vaccines, consisting respectively of a mixture of all the viral proteins and of the surface proteins HA and NA only, were initially developed to overcome the side effects induced by WIV. Virosomes are reconstituted viral membrane envelopes which consist only of the membrane lipids with incorporated surface proteins of influenza virus. This type of vaccine is commercially available in some European countries [23,24]. A clinical study showed that virosome vaccination mainly induces an antibody immune response with comparable titers to those induced by subunit vaccines in humans [25]. VLP vaccines can be produced by co-expression of influenza proteins in insect cells, mammalian cells or plants [26,27]. Pandemic influenza VLP vaccines have been tested in clinical trials and have shown a good level of safety [27]. Annual inactivated influenza vaccines contain 15 \u00b5g of HA protein from each virus strain and are administrated parentally. 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 12 09-10-18 09:121Chapter 1 12 1.3 Evolution of influenza viruses Even when belonging to the same subtype, influenza viruses are genetically diverse.

Virosomes are reconstituted viral membrane envelopes which consist only of the membrane lipids with incorporated surface proteins of influenza virus. This type of vaccine is commercially available in some European countries [23,24]. A clinical study showed that virosome vaccination mainly induces an antibody immune response with comparable titers to those induced by subunit vaccines in humans [25]. VLP vaccines can be produced by co-expression of influenza proteins in insect cells, mammalian cells or plants [26,27]. Pandemic influenza VLP vaccines have been tested in clinical trials and have shown a good level of safety [27]. Annual inactivated influenza vaccines contain 15 \u00b5g of HA protein from each virus strain and are administrated parentally. 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 13 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 1 14 This type of vaccine is recommended for children of more than 6 months of age, the elderly and individuals with high-risk conditions [28]. However, only a modest effect of these vaccines is observed in the elderly; use of high-dose vaccines, containing 60 g HA of each strain, is one of the strategies to overcome the low immunogenicity of the current vaccines in this age group. Adjuvants are another strategy to improve the immunogenicity of these vaccines and to spare the antigen used in vaccines. MF59, an oil-in-water emulsion containing squalene, Tween 80 and sorbitan trioleate, has been licensed for human influenza vaccine. It is thought that MF59 can increase the immunogenicity of vaccines by activating antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [29]. MF59 has been shown to increase the immunogenicity of seasonal influenza vaccine in the elderly and in children [30]. In addition, MF59 also been used in a vaccine against 2009 pdmH1N1 virus [31]. Another oil-in-water emulsion, AS03, has also been used as an adjuvant. AS03 contains a surfactant, polysorbate 80, and two biodegradable oils, squalene and DL-- tocopherol, in PBS. It has been shown that the presence of -tocopherol in AS03 enhances the immunogenicity of the vaccine by activating the innate immune system, particularly monocytes, and subsequently increasing antigen uptake and presentation [32]. AS03 is licensed in H5N1 prepandemic and H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines. It has been reported that AS03- adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine not only induces a higher antibody immune response against a homologous virus strain in the vaccine compared to nonadjuvanted vaccine, but also induces cross-clade immunity to heterologous strains [24]. Similarly, AS03-adjuvanted 2009 shows higher immunogenicity than nonadjuvanted H1N1 vaccines [33]. However, it has been reported that an increase in the incidence of narcolepsy was found in children and adolescents who were vaccinated with AS03-adjuvanted Pandemrix vaccine during the pandemic in 2009 and 2010 [34]. Current LAIV are produced by reverse genetics using predicted HA and NA genes together with a cold-adapted virus backbone. This backbone limits the replication of LAIV to a temperature below 33 \u00b0C, resulting in replication in the upper respiratory tract but not the lower respiratory tract [35]. When administered intranasally, LAIV can be detected from a nasal wash up to 7 days post-vaccination but is rarely isolated longer than 14 days post-vaccination in children [25]. This vaccine is only licensed for healthy individuals aged 2 to 49 or 59 years of age in the US and Canada, respectively. However, in Europe, LAIV is only recommended for children 2 to 18 years of age. A single dose of LAIV is recommended for healthy individuals 9 to 49 years of age and healthy children 5 to 8 years of age who have previously been immunized with an influenza vaccination. Two doses of LAIV are recommended for healthy children 5 to Introduction and scope of this thesis 15 8 years of age receiving influenza vaccine for the first time [36]. It has been reported that LAIV is 92% efficacious at preventing antigenically matched influenza in children [36]. Recently, only poor efficacy of LAIV has been observed in children against the influenza A H1N1 and drifted H3N2 strains. Thus, use of LAIV as a human vaccine was not recommended in the USA in 2016 and 2017. Yet, the problems with low immunogenicity now seem to be solved and the vaccine is again recommended since January 2018. These (adjuvanted) vaccines mainly provide protection by inducing strain-specific neutralizing antibodies. However, virus strains which have undergone antigenic drift or antigenic shift cannot be recognized by those strain-specific antibodies. Thus, these vaccines have to be updated annually. The efficacy of these vaccines is dependent on prediction of the strains which might circulate in the next flu season. Although many methods have been used to optimize this prediction, precise prediction remains difficult [37]. In fact, failure of the predicted strains to match the circulating strains occurs quite often for seasonal influenza vaccine, in these cases current vaccines show poor effectiveness. When a pandemic caused by antigenic shift is emerging, it will take around 6 months to prepare and distribute a pandemic influenza vaccine to humans, which is too late for a vaccine to provide protection during the first wave of the pandemic [38]. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a universal influenza vaccine which can induce cross-protective immunity to variant influenza strains. 3. Immune responses induced by live virus infection Natural influenza virus infection induces a potent antibody and cellular immune response against influenza virus infection. It has been reported that prior infection with live virus can provide heterologous or heterosubtypic protection against drifted virus or shifted virus in animals [39,40] In the following part, we will discuss these protective immune responses induced by live virus infection. Although the exact cross-protective mechanisms are not yet fully understood, identifying these immune responses induced by live virus infection is important for the development of novel vaccines that could provide cross-protection. 3.1 Mucosal immune responses induced by influenza virus infection Considering that the upper respiratory tract (URT) is the primary site for influenza virus infection, antibody responses induced by live virus infection in this place may play an important role in protection against influenza virus infection.Secretory IgA (S-IgA) is the major antibody isotype detected at the mucosal site. It has been reported that S-IgA can prevent the pathology induced by virus infection in the URT [41]. Moreover, adoptive transfer of S-IgA to na\u00efve mice 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 14 09-10-18 09:121Chapter 1 14 This type of vaccine is recommended for children of more than 6 months of age, the elderly and individuals with high-risk conditions [28].

Yet, the problems with low immunogenicity now seem to be solved and the vaccine is again recommended since January 2018. These (adjuvanted) vaccines mainly provide protection by inducing strain-specific neutralizing antibodies. However, virus strains which have undergone antigenic drift or antigenic shift cannot be recognized by those strain-specific antibodies. Thus, these vaccines have to be updated annually. The efficacy of these vaccines is dependent on prediction of the strains which might circulate in the next flu season. Although many methods have been used to optimize this prediction, precise prediction remains difficult [37]. In fact, failure of the predicted strains to match the circulating strains occurs quite often for seasonal influenza vaccine, in these cases current vaccines show poor effectiveness. When a pandemic caused by antigenic shift is emerging, it will take around 6 months to prepare and distribute a pandemic influenza vaccine to humans, which is too late for a vaccine to provide protection during the first wave of the pandemic [38]. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a universal influenza vaccine which can induce cross-protective immunity to variant influenza strains. 3. Immune responses induced by live virus infection Natural influenza virus infection induces a potent antibody and cellular immune response against influenza virus infection. It has been reported that prior infection with live virus can provide heterologous or heterosubtypic protection against drifted virus or shifted virus in animals [39,40] In the following part, we will discuss these protective immune responses induced by live virus infection. Although the exact cross-protective mechanisms are not yet fully understood, identifying these immune responses induced by live virus infection is important for the development of novel vaccines that could provide cross-protection. 3.1 Mucosal immune responses induced by influenza virus infection Considering that the upper respiratory tract (URT) is the primary site for influenza virus infection, antibody responses induced by live virus infection in this place may play an important role in protection against influenza virus infection.Secretory IgA (S-IgA) is the major antibody isotype detected at the mucosal site. It has been reported that S-IgA can prevent the pathology induced by virus infection in the URT [41]. Moreover, adoptive transfer of S-IgA to na\u00efve mice 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 15 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 1 16 has been shown to provide protection against challenge with a homologous virus. These studies indicate that IgA does play an important role in protection against influenza. This may be due to the fact that S-IgA is a neutralizing antibody. It has been reported that IgA in nasal secretions can neutralize the HA of influenza virus [42,43]. A previous study showed that immunization with WIV confers partial cross-protection against drifted strains in wild-type mice; however, no cross-protection is observed in pIgR knockout mice (S-IgA deficient mice) [44]. This study suggests that S-IgA could also provide cross- protection against IAV infection. Moreover, adoptively transferred S-IgA protects na\u00efve mice against a drifted strain of IAV infection [45], which confirms the cross-protective capacity of S-IgA against IAV infection. Another study by Asahi et al showed that S-IgA antibody induced by a strain of influenza B virus infection provides cross-protection against infection with different strains of influenza B virus [46]. However, the mechanism responsible for cross- protection of S-IgA against influenza A and B virus infection remains unknown. Interestingly, a recent study by He et al showed that anti-HA stalk antibodies (such as 6F12 and KB12) with human IgA backbones exhibit stronger neutralization ability than antibodies with human IgG backbones [47]. Moreover, another study, by Muramatsu et al, showed that when targeting the same epitope, IgA antibody exhibits greater capacity to cross-bind to different strains of influenza virus than IgG antibody in vitro. Electron microscopy in the latter study revealed that IgA may provide protection by suppressing the release of virus from infected cells [43]. In addition, a recent study showed that polymeric S-IgA, with a quaternary structure, exhibits stronger neutralizing ability against influenza virus than dimeric S-IgA [48]. These studies suggest that the structure of S-IgA antibody may be correlated with its cross-protective potency against influenza virus infection. In summary, S-IgA antibody can provide (cross-)protection against influenza virus infection. Although the exact mechanism responsible for cross-protection against influenza virus infection is not yet clear, its ability to contribute to cross-protection highlights the importance of developing an influenza vaccine which can induce a strong S-IgA antibody response. 3.2 Serum antibody immune responses induced by influenza virus infection The serum antibody response plays an important role against influenza virus infection. Like influenza vaccines, live virus infection mainly induces neutralizing antibodies. These neutralizing antibodies predominantly mediate protection through blocking attachment of the virus to the target cell surface [49]. Most of these neutralizing antibodies target the variable part Introduction and scope of this thesis 17 of HA protein, providing no cross-protection against drifted or shifted strains. Neutralizing antibodies against the conserved stalk regions of HA have also been detected. These anti-HA stem neutralizing antibodies provide cross-protection [50]. In addition, it has been reported that adoptively transferred serum, in the absence of neutralizing antibody, also provides cross- protection against different strains of influenza virus infection in an animal model [51], which indicates that non-neutralization antibodies may play an important role in cross-protection. Non-neutralizing antibodies may mediate protection via Fc antibody-dependent (reviewed in [56]). Among these mechanisms, ADCC may be the most important one responsible for cross-protection. NK cells play an important role in ADCC. ADCC occurs when CD16 receptor expressed on NK cells binds with the Fc portion of IgG antibodies (IgG1 and IgG3) bound to antigens on virus-infected cells. This binding induces the activation of NK cells and the release of granzyme B and perforin, resulting in DNA fragmentation and apoptosis of the virus-infected cells. Activation of NK cells can also induce secretion of antiviral cytokines such as IFN- and TNF- which have important antiviral activity. Non-neutralizing antibodies have been shown to provide some degree of cross-protection against influenza virus infection [57,58]. Non-neutralizing antibodies predominantly target conserved regions of influenza virus proteins. Of the 17 proteins encoded by influenza, few are conserved between different strains. It has been reported that 55 sequences of 9 to 58 amino acids located in PB1, PA, PB2, NP and M1 proteins are conserved in 80-100% of avian and human IAV isolates [59]. Non-neutralizing antibodies against these conserved sequences have the potential to provide cross-protection against different virus strains. Viral antigens, considered to induce a cross-protective antibody immune response, are discussed below. HA stem region HA protein comprises two regions, a head (HA1) region that is highly variable in amino acids between different strains, and a stem (HA2) region that is conserved (51-80% homology between subtypes) between different strains. This indicates that the epitopes located in the conserved HA2 regions are promising targets for the development of cross-protective antibodies. Anti-HA stem antibodies can be detected following live virus infection by seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 virus in humans and in mice, though at a low level [60,61]. A large amount 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 16 09-10-18 09:121Chapter 1 16 has been shown to provide protection against challenge with a homologous virus. These studies indicate that IgA does play an important role in protection against influenza. This may be due to the fact that S-IgA is a neutralizing antibody.

Although the exact mechanism responsible for cross-protection against influenza virus infection is not yet clear, its ability to contribute to cross-protection highlights the importance of developing an influenza vaccine which can induce a strong S-IgA antibody response. 3.2 Serum antibody immune responses induced by influenza virus infection The serum antibody response plays an important role against influenza virus infection.

Anti-HA stem antibodies can be detected following live virus infection by seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 virus in humans and in mice, though at a low level [60,61]. A large amount 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 17 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 1 18 of anti-HA stem antibodies is found in individuals infected by pdmH1N1 influenza virus [61]. These anti-HA stem antibodies cannot be found in individuals vaccinated with inactivated influenza vaccines [61]. It has been reported that many HA stem-reactive antibodies bind broadly against many influenza virus strains and different subtypes. These anti-HA stem antibodies can provide cross- protection by different mechanisms. First, these stem-reactive HA antibodies can bind to HA presented on the virus, and may be taken up together with the virus into cells; then, these antibodies can prevent the fusion of viral membrane with endosome membrane [62]. Second, HA proteins on virus particles have to be cleaved into HA1 and HA2 subunits to acquire infection ability. Many stem-reactive antibodies can bind to the cleavage site of HA0 and subsequently prevent cleavage to HA1 and HA2 by protease, thus preventing maturation of HA [63]. Furthermore, anti-HA stem antibodies can also clear virus-infected cells via ADCC or ADCP [50,52,64]. NA Like influenza HA protein, NA is also a surface glycoprotein. Compared to antibodies against HA, relatively little attention has been given to anti-NA antibodies. A recent study showed that an antibody to NA is also an independent correlate of protection [65]. NA protein can be divided into four different regions: an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, a thin hypervariable stalk and a global head domain (the enzymatic active site). The enzymatic active site is conserved among different subtypes, which indicates that anti-NA antibodies targeting the conserved enzymatic active site have the potential to induce cross- protective immunity [66,67]. Anti-NA antibodies can be generated by natural infection and vaccination. A recent study by Chen et al showed that natural virus infection induces NA- reactive B cells at a frequency similar to or greater than that of HA-specific B cells; however, influenza vaccines poorly induce NA-reactive B cells [68]. Moreover, in line with previous publications, it has also been reported that these anti-NA antibodies induced by prior natural influenza virus infection are correlated with cross-protective immunity in humans [68,69]. In mice, experimental infection with pdmH1N1 can also induce cross-reactive NA antibodies to H5N1 influenza virus [70]. These studies confirmed that natural influenza virus infection induces antibodies against NA which can provide cross-protection. Moreover, one group has reported that an NA antibody against the conserved epitope of NA is able to inhibit enzymatic activity of N1 to N9 of influenza A subtypes as well as NA of influenza B strains from both lineages [71]. Introduction and scope of this thesis 19 Anti-NA antibodies may provide protection by blocking NA enzyme activity to prevent the release of virus progeny from virus-infected cells. Anti-NA antibody bound to the NA expressed on the surface of virus-infected cells may help the clearance of virus-infected cells by NK cells via ADCC [67]. In addition, one study has speculated that anti-NA antibodies may interfere with the binding of HA to virus receptors expressed on the cell surface, thus preventing infection [72]. M2 protein The integral membrane protein M2 is present in the form of a homo-tetramer and forms a pH- regulated proton channel which is involved in virus uncoating in the endosome and in virus maturation in the Golgi apparatus [73]. M2 also controls the movement of H+ ions into the virion interior, which causes dissociation of the M1 protein from the RNP core, resulting in the release of vRNPs into host cells [74]. M2e, the extracellular domain of the M2 protein, consists of only 23 amino acids and is highly conserved and abundantly expressed on the surface of virus-infected cells, which makes it an attractive target for influenza virus antibodies to induce cross-reactive immunity. Nevertheless, anti-M2e antibody is poorly induced and has short durability following influenza virus infection in humans [75]. This is probably due to the low level of expression of the protein on the virus surface or reduced immunogenicity compared to HA and NA proteins. In a mouse model, primary infection with influenza virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934; PR8) induced a weak anti-M2e antibody immune response [75]; however, the anti-M2e antibody response increased after a second infection with a mutant PR8 strain [76] and then significantly increased after a third infection with H3N2 virus [75,77]. It has been reported that seroprevalence of anti-M2 antibodies increases with age. This may be due to the fact that humans are frequently infected by different influenza subtypes with increasing age. Recently, a robust recall antibody response to M2 was observed in individuals with pre-existing anti-M2 response after pandemic H1N1 virus infection [78]. These experiments indicate that an anti-M2e antibody response can be induced by influenza virus infection and can be boosted by different strains of virus infection. It has been shown that these anti-M2e or anti-M2 antibodies are cross-reactive to different strains of influenza virus [78-80]. These cross-reactive antibodies can mediate cross-protection to influenza virus infection in animal models; however, their contribution to protection in humans is still not clear. 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 18 09-10-18 09:121Chapter 1 18 of anti-HA stem antibodies is found in individuals infected by pdmH1N1 influenza virus [61].

These cross-reactive antibodies can mediate cross-protection to influenza virus infection in animal models; however, their contribution to protection in humans is still not clear. 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 19 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 1 20 Understanding the mechanism of cross-protection induced by anti-M2 antibodies is critical for vaccine development. The protection offered by anti-M2 antibodies is mainly mediated by cell- targeting activity but not virus neutralization activity [80]. A previous publication showed that Fc receptors are required for anti-M2e antibody to provide cross-protection [81]. Thus, a possible mechanism to mediate protection may be ADCC or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) [83-85]. NP protein Influenza NP protein is abundantly expressed in the inside of virus particles and is highly conserved. After infection, NP protein can be expressed on the surface of virus-infected cells in vitro or epithelial cells of the airway of influenza virus-infected mice, and serves there as a suitable target for anti-NP antibodies [84,85]. Anti-NP antibodies can be found in human and animal serum samples after IAV infection [51,75,86,87]. Moreover, a second and a third heterosubtypic strain infection can also boost anti-NP antibody response in mice [75]. These virus infection-induced anti-NP antibodies are cross-reactive to different strains of influenza virus [51,87]. Passive transfer of a large amount of anti-NP antibodies can induce cross-protective immunity to heterosubtypic influenza virus infection in mice [90,91]. These studies suggest that anti-NP antibodies may play an important role in cross-protection. However, how anti-NP antibodies contribute to cross-protection is still not yet clear. It has been reported that the Fc receptor on leukocytes is crucial for cross-protective immunity induced by NP antibodies [89]. A recent publication by Jegaskanda et al showed that NP antibodies can crosslink Fc receptors and activate NK cells [90]. These findings suggest that anti-NP antibodies may mediate cross-protection against different strains of influenza virus via ADCC. 4. T-cell immunity induced by influenza virus infection 4.1 Primary T-cell immune response Besides antibody immune response, influenza virus infection also induces CD4 and CD8 T-cell immune responses. Decades ago, a publication by Wells et al showed that nude mice (T cell- deficient mice) are more susceptible to influenza virus infection than wild-type mice due to higher lung virus titers, lung pathology and mortality [91], which suggests that primary T-cell immune response plays an important role against influenza virus infection. Epithelial cells located in the respiratory tract are the main targets for influenza virus infection. Once infected with influenza virus, these epithelial cells start to produce inflammatory Introduction and scope of this thesis 21 cytokines such as Some of these cytokines attract dendritic cells (DCs) to the site of infection, where these cells become activated. These activated DCs capture viral antigens and mature into APCs [92]. DCs can capture viral antigens via two distinct pathways. The first pathway is through the direct infection of APCs by influenza virus. After influenza infection, viral antigens can be synthesized in the cytosol of APCs. Proteasomes in the cytosol degrade viral proteins into small peptides. After transportation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), these small peptides are presented on MHC class I molecules. Then, these MHC class I peptide complexes are transferred to the surface of the APCs. The second pathway is through phagocytosis of virus particles or infected dead cells. Viral antigens are degraded into small peptides in endosomes/liposomes and presented on MHC class II molecules. In this process, some viral antigens can also be presented on MHC class I molecules, known as cross-presentation [93]. After that, these DCs migrate to drain lymph nodes within 48 h post-infection, where they can activate influenza-specific T cells. Through engagement of MHC-peptide complexes with T-cell receptors (TCRs) located on na\u00efve CD4 T cells, those na\u00efve CD8 and CD4 T cells, respectively, circulating in the secondary lymphatic organs are activated. 4.1.1 Primary CD8 T-cell immune response Na\u00efve CD8 T cells circulate in secondary lymphoid organs, where they survey for foreign antigens. Once activated, CD8 T cells start a process of proliferation and differentiation, resulting in the production of a large amount of CD8 effector cells in lymph nodes [92]. These effector CD8 T cells start to migrate to lung tissue around day 6 post-infection and can provide immediate protection from virus infection. On day 10 post-infection, virus in the lungs is almost cleared, and effector CD8 T cells peak [94]. Decades ago, a study by Bender et al showed that 2M(/) mice also exhibit delayed viral clearance and increased mortality compared to 2M(+/) mice after virus infection [95]. This study suggests that primary CD8 T cells play an important role in the defense against influenza virus. CD8 T cells can provide protection by a combination of different mechanisms. First of all, when TCRs on influenza-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) on virus-infected cells, CTLs can produce cytotoxic molecules such as perforin and granzymes. Perforin can form pores in target cells, which facilitates 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 20 09-10-18 09:121Chapter 1 20 Understanding the mechanism of cross-protection induced by anti-M2 antibodies is critical for vaccine development.

These virus infection-induced anti-NP antibodies are cross-reactive to different strains of influenza virus [51,87].

These studies suggest that anti-NP antibodies may play an important role in cross-protection. However, how anti-NP antibodies contribute to cross-protection is still not yet clear.

First of all, when TCRs on influenza-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) on virus-infected cells, CTLs can produce cytotoxic molecules such as perforin and granzymes. Perforin can form pores in target cells, which facilitates 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 21 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 1 22 granzymes to go inside virus-infected cells and then initiate their apoptosis [96]. Secondly, TCR engagement of MHC-peptide complexes can enhance the expression of the death domain receptor FasL on CTLs. FasL then promotes the apoptosis of virus-infected cells by binding with Fas protein expressed on these cells [96]. A recent study showed that another receptor, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRIAL), expressed on CD8 T cells also contributes to apoptosis of virus-infected cells by the interaction of TRIAL with its ligand (DR5) [97]. Thirdly, CD8+ T cells can also produce a variety of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF- and IFN- [98]. These cytokines play an important role in controlling virus infection [99]. These enhanced CD8 effector T cells in the lung also have the potential to induce lung pathology due to inflammation. Thus, these potent CD8 effector T cells should be downregulated after virus clearance. To do this, CD8 effector T cells can also express IL-10, a potent negative factor of inflammation [100]. In this way, potent CD8 effector T cells balance the protection and lung damage induced by inflammation. 4.1.2 Primary CD4 T-cell immune response Like CD8 T cells, na\u00efve CD4 T cells also circulate in secondary lymphoid organs. Once activated by viral antigen presented on APCs, CD4 T cells start to proliferate and acquire antiviral effector functions, and then migrate to the infection site. The differentiation of CD4 T cells is primarily determined by the cytokine environment in which they are formed. Depending on the production of signature cytokines, IFN-, IL4 and IL17, CD4 T cells can be divided into three different subsets: T helper 1 (Th1), Th2 and Th17 cells. Influenza virus infection can generate Th1 and Th2 responses but is biased towards Th1 immune response. After infection, virus-specific Th1 cells mainly produce IFN-, TNF and IL-2. Th1 cells enhance proinflammatory cellular immunity and provide protection against lethal influenza virus infection. Th2 cells mainly produce IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. The main function of Th2 cells is to promote non-inflammatory immune responses and induce the production of antibodies. However, Th2 cells are not protective against lethal influenza virus infection [101]. Th17 T cells have also been detected in mice infected by influenza virus [102]. Th17 cells mainly produce IL-17 and IL-22. The roles of Th17 cells against influenza virus infection are not well understood. Most recent studies have focused on the role of IL-17 signaling during influenza virus infection. A study by Wang et al reported that IL-17 signaling can provide protection against a high level of pathogenic H5N1 virus infection, which is correlated with B- cell recruitment to mouse lungs [103]. However, some other studies have reported that IL-17 Introduction and scope of this thesis 23 signaling may contribute to immunopathology during influenza virus infection [102]. A study by McKinstry et al directly investigated the role of Th17-producing CD4 T cells during influenza virus infection. This study showed that adoptively transferred Th17 CD4 T cells can protect mice from a low lethal dose of PR8 virus infection, and this protection is independent of IFN-, B-cell helper function, perforin-mediated cytotoxicity and IL-17A [104]. In addition, IL-22 produced by Th17 T cells plays an important role in tissue repair (reviewed in [105]). Influenza virus infection also results in the generation of antigen-specific T follicular helper T cells (Tfh) [106]. Instead of circulating in peripheral sites, Tfh cells mainly stay at the boundaries of B-cell zones within lymph nodes. It is thought that Tfh cells play an important role in germinal center formation, isotype switching, affinity mutation of antibody response and memory B-cell formation [102]. Tfh cells can also express IFN- and IL-4, thus stimulating the production of Th1-related IgG2a and Th2-related IgG1 antibodies in mice. However, whether these cells can form a memory phenotype remains unknown. 4.2 T-cell memory immune response After clearance of the virus in the lungs, most effector T cells undergo apoptosis. Only around 5-10% of them form long-living memory cells. Upon reinfection with the same pathogen, these memory T cells undergo a strong clonal expansion and differentiate into effector T cells quickly to provide protection. Memory cells are heterologous in terms of phenotype. Based on the expression of CCR7 and CD62L on the cell surface, memory T cells can be divided into two different subtypes: low CCR7- and CD62L-expressing effector memory T cells (Tem) and high CCR7- and CD62L- expressing central memory T cells (Tcm). Tem mainly circulate between the blood and nonlymphoid tissues. During antigen recognition, Tem can rapidly provide protection like new effector cells. Tcm predominantly circulate in the secondary lymphoid organs by using CCR7 and CD62L to cross endothelial venules. Tcm cells have also been found accumulated in the bone marrow [107]. Upon antigen recognition, Tcm cells undergo a rapid and robust proliferation and differentiation and then migrate to the site of infection. Recently, another subtype of memory T cell, resident memory T (Trm) cells, was identified based on the expression of CD103 and CD69. After clearance of influenza virus in the lungs, these lung Trm cells remain in the lungs instead of returning to the circulation. It has been reported that the precursors of Trm cells are Tem cells [108]. The importance of memory CD8 T cells during influenza virus infection has been studied in 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 22 09-10-18 09:121Chapter 1 22 granzymes to go inside virus-infected cells and then initiate their apoptosis [96]. Secondly, TCR engagement of MHC-peptide complexes can enhance the expression of the death domain receptor FasL on CTLs. FasL then promotes the apoptosis of virus-infected cells by binding with Fas protein expressed on these cells [96]. A recent study showed that another receptor, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRIAL), expressed on CD8 T cells also contributes to apoptosis of virus-infected cells by the interaction of TRIAL with its ligand (DR5) [97]. Thirdly, CD8+ T cells can also produce a variety of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF- and IFN- [98]. These cytokines play an important role in controlling virus infection [99]. These enhanced CD8 effector T cells in the lung also have the potential to induce lung pathology due to inflammation. Thus, these potent CD8 effector T cells should be downregulated after virus clearance. To do this, CD8 effector T cells can also express IL-10, a potent negative factor of inflammation [100]. In this way, potent CD8 effector T cells balance the protection and lung damage induced by inflammation. 4.1.2 Primary CD4 T-cell immune response Like CD8 T cells, na\u00efve CD4 T cells also circulate in secondary lymphoid organs. Once activated by viral antigen presented on APCs, CD4 T cells start to proliferate and acquire antiviral effector functions, and then migrate to the infection site. The differentiation of CD4 T cells is primarily determined by the cytokine environment in which they are formed. Depending on the production of signature cytokines, IFN-, IL4 and IL17, CD4 T cells can be divided into three different subsets: T helper 1 (Th1), Th2 and Th17 cells. Influenza virus infection can generate Th1 and Th2 responses but is biased towards Th1 immune response. After infection, virus-specific Th1 cells mainly produce IFN-, TNF and IL-2. Th1 cells enhance proinflammatory cellular immunity and provide protection against lethal influenza virus infection. Th2 cells mainly produce IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13.

However, Th2 cells are not protective against lethal influenza virus infection [101]. Th17 T cells have also been detected in mice infected by influenza virus [102].

The importance of memory CD8 T cells during influenza virus infection has been studied in 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 23 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 1 24 animals. It has been reported that adoptively transferred memory CD8 T cells can protect mice from influenza virus infection [109]. Memory CD4 T cells can provide protection against influenza virus infection by different mechanisms [110]. The best-known function of CD4 T cells is to provide help for B cells via the production of cytokines and costimulatory signals, which not only facilitate B-cell activation and differentiation but also assist with isotype switching to generate protective neutralizing antibodies. Another important role for memory CD4+ T cells is to provide help in the generation of effector and memory CD8+ T cells [105]. In addition to providing help for B cells and CD8 T lymphocytes, CD4 T cells also induce protective immunity through intrinsic mechanisms. Firstly, like CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells can directly kill influenza virus-infected cells in a perforin-dependent manner [111,112]. Secondly, memory CD4 T cells can provide protection by secretion of cytokines such as IFN- themselves to attract the innate cells to the infection site [110,113]. 5. Targets of the T-cell immune response: potential for cross-protection Influenza virus encodes at least 17 proteins, as mentioned above. Each of these proteins may contain lots of different peptide epitopes. Despite this, cellular immunity is reported to focus on only a limited number of epitopes. This phenomenon is called immunodominance. Knowing which peptides are likely to be immunodominant would be helpful for understanding cellular immunity against influenza virus infection. To understand the peptides presented in human MHC class I molecules, some studies directly eluted peptides from purified peptide-MHC class I complexes and then analyzed these peptides by sequencing or mass spectrometry [114]. Based on this method, it was reported that most of the influenza peptides presented on human MHC class I molecules are derived from conserved internal viral proteins [115]. Recently, a systematic screening approach, which is more accurate and robust compared to the elution- based method, has been used to identify the immunodominant peptides against influenza virus. With this approach, overlapping peptides from influenza proteins are used to stimulate human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which shows that immunodominant epitopes are located predominantly in M1 and NP proteins [116]. Sandt et al reported that virus-specific CD8 T cells induced by seasonal influenza virus infection show considerable cross-reactivity to H7N9 virus [117]. Moreover, the 18% from M1 and 16% derived internal proteins; for IAV are recorded in IEDB, only 30% of which are derived from conserved proteins Introduction and scope of this thesis 25 (16% from NP and 14% from M1). It has been reported that conserved proteins, such as M1 and NP, are the immunodominant targets for CD4 T-cell immunity [116,118,119] Collectively, these studies show that most of the predominant peptides presented by MHC class I and II molecules during an influenza infection are derived from conserved influenza proteins, implying that CD8 and CD4 T cells recognizing these peptide epitopes have the potential to provide cross-protection against different strains of influenza virus. 6. Memory T cells are important for cross-protective immunity Many studies have shown that memory CD8 T cells induced by live virus infection play an important role in cross-protection against different strains of virus infection [120]. Kreijtz et al reported that prior H3N2 influenza virus infection protects mice from H5N1 virus challenge [121]. Guo et al showed that the depletion of memory T cells (CD4 or CD8 T cells) induced by H3N2 virus infection significantly impairs cross-protection against pdmH1N1 virus infection in mice [40]. Hillaire et al demonstrated that adoptively transferred memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, but not B cells, induced by prior H3N2 virus infection are responsible for cross-protection against pdmH1N1 virus infection in mice. Besides that, researchers have also found that CD8 T cells induced by seasonal influenza virus infection can clear pdmH1N1 virus infection in macaques [122]. Consistent with these findings in animals, some studies in humans have also identified the cross-protective potential of CD8 T cells. By stimulating human PBMCs with overlapping IAV peptides, it was found that CD8 T cells generated by seasonal IAV infection can cross-react with H5N1 variant, pdmH1N1 variant or H3N2 variant [116]. Moreover, Sridhar et al reported that a higher frequency of pre-existing T cells to conserved CD8 epitopes is correlated with less severe illness during pdmH1N1 virus infection in humans [123]. Another study, by Wang et al, also reported that memory CD8 T-cell immunity is correlated with recovery from H7N9 infection in humans [124]. Besides memory CD8 T cells, memory CD4 T cells induced by live virus infection also play an important role in cross-protection. It has been shown that CD4 T cells specific for conserved epitopes induced by seasonal live virus infection provide cross-protection against H1N1pdm09 in mice [125]. Depletion of CD4 T cells before influenza virus re-challenge results in reduced cross-protective immunity [40]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the presence of memory cross-reactive CD4 T cells is correlated with cross-protection against 2009 virus infection in humans [126]. 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 24 09-10-18 09:121Chapter 1 24 animals.

Cooperation between cross-protective immune mechanisms As mentioned above, cross-reactive antibodies, cross-reactive CD4 T cells and cross-reactive CD8 T cells are involved in cross-protection against different types of influenza virus infection. However, the extent to which these cross-reactive immunities contribute to cross-protection is not yet clear. Recent studies indicate that these cross-reactive immune mechanisms cooperate to provide optimal cross-protection. Non-neutralizing antibodies in combination with virus-specific memory CD8 T cells can provide cross-protection against heterosubtypic influenza virus challenge [58,88] A study by Laidlaw et al showed that influenza-specific CD8 T cells or non-neutralizing antibodies alone are ineffective at providing cross-protection, but virus-specific CD8 T cells and non- neutralizing antibodies together elicit effective cross-protection [58]. Moreover, the study by Wu et al even indicated that influenza-specific lung CD8 Trm, but not Tcm, cells cooperate with provide optimal cross-protection [127]. However, how non- neutralizing antibodies cooperate with memory CD8 T cells to provide protection remains unknown. In the first study, the authors demonstrated that the cooperation may be dependent on alveolar macrophages or other lung phagocytes. Hillaire et al showed that adoptive transfer of both memory CD4 and memory CD8 T cells to na\u00efve mice can provide better cross-protection against pdmH1N1 virus infection than adoptive transfer of memory CD4 or CD8 T cells alone. Depletion of memory CD8 T cells and memory CD4 T cells together results in more severe weight loss than depletion of memory CD8 or memory CD4 T cells alone upon pdmH1N1 virus challenge in mice [40]. These studies indicate that memory CD4 T cells together with memory CD8 T cells provide better cross-protection then each of them alone. This makes sense because we already know that memory CD4 or CD8 T cells can provide cross-protection alone by different mechanisms. Besides that, memory CD4 T cells, compared with primary CD4 T cells, can induce a faster and more robust B-cell antibody response due to the expression of CD40L and the secretion of cytokines like IL-4 and IFN- [128]. Another study indicated that memory CD4 T cells can also promote the recruitment of memory CD8 T cells to the site of infection to control early virus infection by increasing local expression of CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) ligands [129]. It has also been hypothesized that memory CD4 T cells can accelerate na\u00efve CD8 response to virus infection through more rapid licensing of APCs and through faster production of cytokines like IL-2 [102]. Introduction and scope of this thesis 27 Interestingly, Carragher et al showed that polyclonal NP antibodies can protect T cell-sufficient \u00b5MT mice but not T and B cell-deficient Rag1/ mice from influenza virus infection [88]. This study indicated that non-neutralizing antibodies also cooperate with other na\u00efve lymphocyte cells to provide cross-protection against influenza virus infection. However, it is still not yet clear how these na\u00efve lymphocyte cells cooperate with non-neutralizing antibodies to provide cross-protection. Collectively, many different mechanisms can provide cross-protection against influenza virus; therefore, it is difficult to attribute cross-protective immunity in vivo to a single mechanism. Recent studies indicate that these cross-reactive immunities cooperate to provide cross- protection. Although how these cross-reactive immunities cooperate is not yet clear, an influenza vaccine that could induce cross-reactive antibodies, cross-reactive CD4 T-cell immunity and cross-reactive CD8 T-cell immunity would be a promising approach for the development of a universal influenza vaccine. 8. Scope of this thesis In the previous, we listed cross-protective mechanisms induced by live virus infection. To what extent these cross-protective immune responses contribute to cross-protection is so far unknown. The aim of the studies described in this thesis was to understand the different cross-protective immune mechanisms induced by live virus infection and vaccination, to determine their respective role in protection from infection by diverse influenza virus strains, and to elucidate how these immune responses can be induced, enhanced or altered. A detailed knowledge of these aspects will allow us to better understand how different immune mechanisms contribute to cross-protection and further guide the design of novel \"universal\" influenza vaccine. Indeed, in our studies, we already developed novel \"universal\" candidate vaccines and evaluated them in animal models. In chapter 2 , we compare the cross-reactive immune responses against H1N1pdm09 virus evoked by sequential infection with seasonal virus with those induced by sequential vaccination with WIV or SU vaccine derived from these viruses in mice, through which we would like to determine which immune response is essential for cross-protection. Large amounts of WIV are required to induce cross-reactive CTLs. To reduce the dose of WIV used in vaccination, some adjuvants are used to increase the cellular responses induced by WIV vaccination. However, when adjuvanted with alum, only an antibody immune response can be induced [130]. An adjuvant which could enhance the generation of cellular immune response 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 26 09-10-18 09:121Chapter 1 26 7.

Scope of this thesis In the previous, we listed cross-protective mechanisms induced by live virus infection.

The aim of the studies described in this thesis was to understand the different cross-protective immune mechanisms induced by live virus infection and vaccination, to determine their respective role in protection from infection by diverse influenza virus strains, and to elucidate how these immune responses can be induced, enhanced or altered. A detailed knowledge of these aspects will allow us to better understand how different immune mechanisms contribute to cross-protection and further guide the design of novel \"universal\" influenza vaccine. Indeed, in our studies, we already developed novel \"universal\" candidate vaccines and evaluated them in animal models. In chapter 2 , we compare the cross-reactive immune responses against H1N1pdm09 virus evoked by sequential infection with seasonal virus with those induced by sequential vaccination with WIV or SU vaccine derived from these viruses in mice, through which we would like to determine which immune response is essential for cross-protection. Large amounts of WIV are required to induce cross-reactive CTLs. To reduce the dose of WIV used in vaccination, some adjuvants are used to increase the cellular responses induced by WIV vaccination. However, when adjuvanted with alum, only an antibody immune response can be induced [130]. An adjuvant which could enhance the generation of cellular immune response 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 27 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 1 28 would benefit the cross-protection induced by WIV vaccination. In chapter 3 , the main objective was to carry out a head-to-head comparison of liposome- and protein-based adjuvants along with WIV vaccines to assess cross-protection in mice and select the best candidates based on their performance in terms of cross-protection provided and cross-reactive immune responses induced by these vaccine candidates. In chapter 2 , our results indicate that both antibody immune response and cellular immune response are required for better cross-protection. In chapter 4 , we developed a modified influenza virosome vaccine consisting of the membrane proteins of influenza virus with toll- like receptor 4 ligand monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) incorporated in the membrane, and conserved influenza NP protein conjugated on the membrane. We investigated whether these modified virosomes could favor the activation of APCs and facilitate access of NP protein to the MHC class I pathway, and then successfully induce CTLs in mice. Immune responses in mice differ to those in humans. Difference in the immune response between mice and humans makes the direct translation of these findings in mice to humans challenging. A recent study even indicates that the immune response in laboratory mice is different to those in wild mice. Moreover, sequential infection with herpes viruses, influenza and a helminth can shift the immune response in laboratory mice to that in wild mice. Furthermore, sequential infection in laboratory mice reduces antibody production after vaccination against yellow fever virus. These studies indicate that infection history can alter the pre-vaccination status of laboratory mice and subsequently influence the immunogenicity of vaccines. Thus, in chapter 5 , we determined whether infection of laboratory mice with Streptococcus pneumoniae could influence the immune response induced by WIV vaccination. Compared with mice, the cotton rat is a good model to study the pathogenesis of influenza infection. Although the cotton rat has also been used as an animal model to study the effectiveness of influenza vaccine, viral titer in the lungs is the only parameter used for vaccine evaluation. To determine whether some other parameters could be used to determine the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in cotton rats, in chapter 6 we vaccinated cotton rats with WIV, and then challenged them with pdmH1N1 virus. Lastly, in chapter 7 , we summarize and discuss the results obtained in this thesis. Introduction and scope of this thesis 29 References [1] Bouvier NM, Palese P.

In chapter 3 , the main objective was to carry out a head-to-head comparison of liposome- and protein-based adjuvants along with WIV vaccines to assess cross-protection in mice and select the best candidates based on their performance in terms of cross-protection provided and cross-reactive immune responses induced by these vaccine candidates. In chapter 2 , our results indicate that both antibody immune response and cellular immune response are required for better cross-protection. In chapter 4 , we developed a modified influenza virosome vaccine consisting of the membrane proteins of influenza virus with toll- like receptor 4 ligand monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) incorporated in the membrane, and conserved influenza NP protein conjugated on the membrane. We investigated whether these modified virosomes could favor the activation of APCs and facilitate access of NP protein to the MHC class I pathway, and then successfully induce CTLs in mice. Immune responses in mice differ to those in humans. Difference in the immune response between mice and humans makes the direct translation of these findings in mice to humans challenging. A recent study even indicates that the immune response in laboratory mice is different to those in wild mice. Moreover, sequential infection with herpes viruses, influenza and a helminth can shift the immune response in laboratory mice to that in wild mice. Furthermore, sequential infection in laboratory mice reduces antibody production after vaccination against yellow fever virus. These studies indicate that infection history can alter the pre-vaccination status of laboratory mice and subsequently influence the immunogenicity of vaccines. Thus, in chapter 5 , we determined whether infection of laboratory mice with Streptococcus pneumoniae could influence the immune response induced by WIV vaccination. Compared with mice, the cotton rat is a good model to study the pathogenesis of influenza infection. Although the cotton rat has also been used as an animal model to study the effectiveness of influenza vaccine, viral titer in the lungs is the only parameter used for vaccine evaluation. To determine whether some other parameters could be used to determine the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in cotton rats, in chapter 6 we vaccinated cotton rats with WIV, and then challenged them with pdmH1N1 virus. Lastly, in chapter 7 , we summarize and discuss the results obtained in this thesis. Introduction and scope of this thesis 29 References [1] Bouvier NM, Palese P.

Here we investigated whether sequential immunization with antigenically distinct influenza vaccines can also provide cross-protection. To this end, we compared immune responses and protective potential against challenge with A(H1N1)pdm09 in mice infected sequentially with seasonal A(H1N1) virus followed by A(H3N2) virus or immunized sequentially with whole inactivated virus (WIV) or subunit (SU) vaccine derived from these viruses. Sequential infection provided solid cross- protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 infection while sequential vaccination with WIV, though not capable of preventing weight loss upon infection completely, protected the mice from reaching the humane endpoint. In contrast, sequential SU vaccination did not prevent rapid and extensive weight loss. Protection correlated with levels of cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies of the IgG2a subclass, general increase of memory T cells and induction of influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Adoptive serum transfer experiments revealed that despite lacking neutralizing activity, serum antibodies induced by sequential infection protected mice from weight loss and vigorous virus growth in the lungs upon A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge. Antibodies induced by WIV vaccination alleviated symptoms but could not control virus growth in the lung. Depletion of T cells prior to challenge revealed that CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, contributed to cross-protection. These results imply that sequential immunization with WIV but not SU derived from antigenically distinct viruses could alleviate the severity of infection caused by a pandemic and may improve protection to unpredictable seasonal infection. Keywords: sequential vaccination, cross-protection, antigenically distinct influenza virus, immune mechanism, non-neutralizing antibody Cross-protection through sequential flu vaccination 39 Introduction Influenza A virus (IAV) infections remain a worldwide public health threat. Influenza vaccination is the most reliable strategy to control annual epidemics and irregular pandemics[1]. Current inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) primarily induce strain-specific antibodies against the two major virus surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). However, these strain-specific antibodies cannot provide protection against antigenically drifted and antigenically shifted strains. When a pandemic strain emerges, it takes around six months to develop and distribute a new vaccine[2], which is too late for a vaccine to provide effective protection during the first pandemic wave. Thus, a cross-protective vaccine that could provide immediate protection against unpredicted influenza virus strains is urgently needed. Live virus infection has been shown to provide some degree of cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in animal models[3-8] and in humans[9,10]. However, the exact mechanisms involved in cross-protection remain elusive. Cross-reactive antibodies against conserved regions of viral proteins, such as the HA stalk, the M2 ectodomain (M2e) and NP, induced by (sequential) live virus infection, correlate with cross-protection[3,11-13]. Some anti-HA stalk antibodies can directly neutralize influenza virus particles in vitro [14]. However, most of these antibodies target antigens that are expressed on the surface of infected cells and then provide cross-protection via a Fc receptor dependent mechanism[14-16]. Besides antibody responses, cross-reactive T cells induced by live virus infection have also been demonstrated to correlate with cross-protection[5,6,17]. Cytotoxic CD8 T cells can recognize internal, conserved epitopes across different virus strains. In animal models, CD8 T cells induced by live virus infection have been shown to prevent A(H5N1) or A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection[18]. On the other hand, CD4 T cells specific for conserved epitopes have also been shown to provide protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 in mice[19,20]. These CD4 T cells could provide cross-protection through different mechanisms, including help for B cells, help for CD8 T cells and direct cytotoxic activity (reviewed in [21]). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in humans that the presence of memory cross-reactive CD4 or CD8 T cells is correlated with or virus infection[9,22,23]. Vaccination with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) did not provide protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection and was even found to be associated with enhanced disease in observational studies from Canada in humans[24-28]. In animal models, published studies indicate that vaccination with IIV could induce detectable levels of cross-reactive antibody 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 38 09-10-18 09:122Chapter 2 38 Abstract Sequential infection with antigenically distinct influenza viruses induces cross-protective immune responses against heterologous virus strains in animal models. Here we investigated whether sequential immunization with antigenically distinct influenza vaccines can also provide cross-protection. To this end, we compared immune responses and protective potential against challenge with A(H1N1)pdm09 in mice infected sequentially with seasonal A(H1N1) virus followed by A(H3N2) virus or immunized sequentially with whole inactivated virus (WIV) or subunit (SU) vaccine derived from these viruses. Sequential infection provided solid cross- protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 infection while sequential vaccination with WIV, though not capable of preventing weight loss upon infection completely, protected the mice from reaching the humane endpoint. In contrast, sequential SU vaccination did not prevent rapid and extensive weight loss. Protection correlated with levels of cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies of the IgG2a subclass, general increase of memory T cells and induction of influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Adoptive serum transfer experiments revealed that despite lacking neutralizing activity, serum antibodies induced by sequential infection protected mice from weight loss and vigorous virus growth in the lungs upon A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge. Antibodies induced by WIV vaccination alleviated symptoms but could not control virus growth in the lung. Depletion of T cells prior to challenge revealed that CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, contributed to cross-protection. These results imply that sequential immunization with WIV but not SU derived from antigenically distinct viruses could alleviate the severity of infection caused by a pandemic and may improve protection to unpredictable seasonal infection. Keywords: sequential vaccination, cross-protection, antigenically distinct influenza virus, immune mechanism, non-neutralizing antibody Cross-protection through sequential flu vaccination 39 Introduction Influenza A virus (IAV) infections remain a worldwide public health threat. Influenza vaccination is the most reliable strategy to control annual epidemics and irregular pandemics[1]. Current inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) primarily induce strain-specific antibodies against the two major virus surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). However, these strain-specific antibodies cannot provide protection against antigenically drifted and antigenically shifted strains. When a pandemic strain emerges, it takes around six months to develop and distribute a new vaccine[2], which is too late for a vaccine to provide effective protection during the first pandemic wave. Thus, a cross-protective vaccine that could provide immediate protection against unpredicted influenza virus strains is urgently needed. Live virus infection has been shown to provide some degree of cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in animal models[3-8] and in humans[9,10]. However, the exact mechanisms involved in cross-protection remain elusive. Cross-reactive antibodies against conserved regions of viral proteins, such as the HA stalk, the M2 ectodomain (M2e) and NP, induced by (sequential) live virus infection, correlate with cross-protection[3,11-13]. Some anti-HA stalk antibodies can directly neutralize influenza virus particles in vitro [14]. However, most of these antibodies target antigens that are expressed on the surface of infected cells and then provide cross-protection via a Fc receptor dependent mechanism[14-16]. Besides antibody responses, cross-reactive T cells induced by live virus infection have also been demonstrated to correlate with cross-protection[5,6,17]. Cytotoxic CD8 T cells can recognize internal, conserved epitopes across different virus strains. In animal models, CD8 T cells induced by live virus infection have been shown to prevent A(H5N1) or A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection[18]. On the other hand, CD4 T cells specific for conserved epitopes have also been shown to provide protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 in mice[19,20]. These CD4 T cells could provide cross-protection through different mechanisms, including help for B cells, help for CD8 T cells and direct cytotoxic activity (reviewed in [21]). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in humans that the presence of memory cross-reactive CD4 or CD8 T cells is correlated with or virus infection[9,22,23]. Vaccination with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) did not provide protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection and was even found to be associated with enhanced disease in observational studies from Canada in humans[24-28]. In animal models, published studies indicate that vaccination with IIV could induce detectable levels of cross-reactive antibody 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 39 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 2 40 against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, yet, no cross-protection was observed[29-31]. The exception is a recent study showing that non-neutralizing antibody induced by IIV could cause activation of influenza-specific CD8 T cells by promoting antigen presentation[32]. If a broader immune response could be induced by the currently available influenza vaccines, it would benefit humans against novel virus infection. Compared with a single virus infection, sequential infection with antigenically distinct live viruses was found to provide broader cross-protection[7,8,11]. This is because the second infection can cause a quick recall immune response to epitopes shared between the two viruses. It has been shown that sequential influenza virus infection can boost antibody responses to the shared HA stalk region[11,33]. Sequential immunization with antigenically distinct vaccines has also been used as a strategy to induce a broader immune response against influenza virus in animal models[34]. However, most of these studies were focused on the cross-protective immune response induced by genetically modified vaccines[35-38]. Little is known about the protective potential of sequential immunization with conventional inactivated vaccines derived from different seasonal influenza virus strains. In case of a pandemic, such a vaccination strategy could be a first means of intervention until a pandemic vaccine becomes available. In this study, we assessed the cross-protective immune responses induced by sequential infection with A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) virus, or sequential immunization with whole inactivated virus (WIV) or subunit (SU) vaccine derived from these viruses in a mouse model. Sequential infection provided robust cross-protection which was mediated by non-neutralizing, cross-reactive antibody and CD8 effector memory T cells (TEM). Partial cross-protection was provided by sequential vaccination with WIV and was associated with CD8 central memory T cells (TCM), and to a minor extent, with cross-reactive antibodies. In contrast, sequential vaccination with SU vaccine induced low levels of cross-reactive serum antibodies and no T cell immunity against A(H1N1)pdm09, and did not provide cross-protection. These results imply that in case of a new pandemic, sequential immunization with WIV but not subunit vaccines derived from different seasonal virus strains could mitigate disease severity until a pandemic vaccine becomes available. Cross-protection through sequential flu vaccination 41 Materials and Methods Virus and vaccines Influenza virus strains A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1)(PR8), X-31, A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 were grown in embryonated chicken eggs, and the virus preparations were titrated on MDCK cells and in mice. Whole inactivated virus vaccines was produced from PR8, X31 and X-181 (HA and NA proteins from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 and internal proteins from PR8) by treatment with -propiolactone. PR8 subunit (SU) vaccine and X-31 SU were prepared from PR8 and X- 31 WIV, respectively, as described before [39]. Vaccination, challenge and sample collection Female 6-8 weeks old CB6F1 mice) were purchased from Envigo, The Netherlands, and rested for at least one week. Mice were housed under SPF conditions in standard polycarbonate cages (5 animals per cage) with standard rodent bedding and cardboard cylinders as cage enrichment. Prior to the start of the experiment, animals were randomly allocated to the different treatment groups. All animal experiments were approved by the Central Committee for Animal Experiments CCD of the Netherlands (AVD105002016599). All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen. Group sizes were determined using Piface software such that a power of at least 80% was reached. Naive mice (n = 15) were immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) with 15 \u00b5g of PR8 WIV (containing 5 \u00b5g of HA) or 5 \u00b5g of PR8 SU vaccine. Alternatively, mice were anesthetized and infected intranasally (i.n.) with a sublethal dose (103 TCID 50) of PR8 virus (live virus = LV). Four weeks after immunization or infection, mice were i.m. immunized with 15 \u00b5g of X-31 WIV or 5 of X-31 SU or i.n. infected with a sublethal dose of (103 TCID 50) X-31 virus. Mice injected twice with PBS i.m. with 28 days interval served as negative control (Table 1). Four weeks after the second infection or immunization, 5 mice of each group were sacrificed for determination of infection- or vaccine-induced immune responses. The other 10 mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and challenged i.n. with 104.4 TCID50 of H1N1pdm09 A/California/7/2009 in 40 \u00b5l PBS. Three days post infection, 5 mice were sacrificed for determination of immune responses and lung virus titers.

These viral strains were selected to reflect a heterosubtypic exposure history in humans. The cross-protective capacity of sequential infection or sequential immunization was determined by challenging the mice with virus A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09. After A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge, mice in the sequential SU vaccination group showed similar weight loss as mice in the PBS control group and developed severe symptoms, necessitating euthanasia on day 6 or 7 post challenge (Fig. 1 A, B). Mice that were sequentially vaccinated with WIV showed a similar trend of weight loss as mice in the PBS control group until day 6 post infection. Yet, from day 7 post infection onwards, WIV immunized mice recovered and none of the mice reached the humane endpoint. In the sequential infection group, mice showed no or only minor weight loss after challenge and none of them needed to be sacrificed. On day 3 post-challenge, lung virus titers in the sequential SU vaccination group did not differ significantly from those in the PBS control group (Fig. 1C). In the sequential WIV vaccination group, lung virus titers were decreased by 0.9 log 10 as compared to the PBS group (p = 0.03). Sequential infection resulted in a significant decrease of the lung virus titer by 2 log 10 relative to the control group (p = 0.015). These data demonstrate that sequential immunization with WIV, although being less effective than sequential infection with live virus, provided a certain level of cross-protection against heterologous infection. In contrast, sequential SU vaccination did not provide cross-protection. Cross-protection through sequential flu vaccination 47 Figure 1. Weight loss and survival rate of immunized mice after A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge . Na\u00efve mice (n=10) were sequentially infected with sublethal doses of two different strains (PR8 and then X31) of live virus (LV) with 28 days interval or were sequentially immunized with vaccines (WIV, SU) derived from these virus strains and then challenged with virus A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09. After challenge, mice (n=5) were monitored daily for weight loss (A) and survival (B) for a period of 14 days. On day 3 post-challenge, lung virus titers in 5 mice/group were determined by titration on MDCK cells (C). * p<0.05, Mann-Whitney U test. The dashed line represents the limit of detection. Sequential infection, WIV and SU vaccination induce distinct cross-reactive antibody immune responses To explore the immune mechanisms involved in protection from weight loss and lung virus growth upon challenge, A(H1N1)pdm09 cross-reactive antibody responses induced by sequential infection with PR8 and X-31 or immunization with PR8 and X-31 derived vaccines were determined. Sequential infection induced around 20 times more cross-reactive IgG antibody than sequential WIV vaccination and approximately 75 times more cross-reactive IgG antibody than sequential SU vaccination (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2A). With respect to the subtype profile of the IgG antibodies, sequential infection and WIV vaccination induced a Th1-type antibody response. The average ratio of serum IgG2a to IgG1 concentration was 3 for mice sequentially infected by live virus, compared with 1.5 induced by sequential WIV vaccination. In contrast, sequential SU vaccination induced a similar amount of IgG1 antibody as induced by sequential WIV 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 46 09-10-18 09:122Chapter 2 46 Results Sequential infection, WIV and SU vaccination show different levels of cross-protective capacity against H1N1pdm09 influenza virus infection To investigate the cross-protective immune response induced by sequential infection or vaccination with antigens from different influenza virus strains, we sequentially infected mice with PR8 and X-31 influenza virus or sequentially vaccinated mice with WIV or SU vaccines derived from these viruses.

In contrast, sequential SU vaccination induced a similar amount of IgG1 antibody as induced by sequential WIV 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 47 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 2 48 vaccination but no IgG2a (Fig. 2B). However, cross-reactive antibodies, irrespective of whether induced by sequential infection or immunization, did not neutralize A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (Fig. 2C). With respect to mucosal antibodies, only sequential infection was found to induce cross- reactive IgA antibody against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in the nose (Fig. 2D). Figure 2. Cross-reactive antibody immune response induced by sequential infection or immunization. On day 28 post the second infection or immunization, serum samples and nasal washes were collected from the mice described in the legend to Fig. 1. Anti-H1N1pdm09-specific IgG were detected by ELISA. Microneutralization assay was used to determine the neutralizing ability of these antibodies towards A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (C; n=5). Anti-H1N1pdm09 IgA antibody levels in nasal washes were determined by ELISA (D; n=5). Data of individual animals (A, B, C) are depicted or mean values \u00b1 SEM (D) are given, **, p<0.01, ***, p<0.001. Mann-Whitney U test. The dashed line represents the limit of detection. In order to reveal the target protein(s) of the observed cross-reactive antibodies we first performed a pseudovirus-based assay to detect antibodies to the HA stalk domain. This assay uses a chimeric HA as antigen, with an H11 globular head, and an H1 stalk. The chimeric particles were effectively neutralized by the CR6261 mAb control which binds to the H1 stalk. However, no antibodies reacting with the H1 stalk were observed in any of the experimental groups (data not shown). Next, we examined anti-NA antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The mice from the sequential infection group and 4 out of 5 mice from Cross-protection through sequential flu vaccination 49 the WIV vaccination group developed anti-NA antibodies, while only 2 out of 5 mice from the sequential SU vaccination group did so and levels of anti-NA antibody were low (Fig. 3A). Next, anti-M2e antibody titers were determined by coating conserved M2e peptide onto 96- well ELISA plate. Anti-M2e antibodies were only found in the sequential infection group (Fig. 3B). We also analyzed the presence of cross-reactive antibodies against conserved internal proteins in serum using recombinant NP from HK68 (H3N2), which shows 90% of sequence homology with NP from A(H1N1)pdm09. Sequential infection and WIV vaccination induced similar though somewhat variable amounts of anti-NP antibodies (Fig. 3C). As expected, no anti-NP antibody was found in the sequential SU vaccination group. Figure 3. Cross-reactive antibodies against conserved proteins induced by sequential infection or immunization. Mice were primed and boosted as described in the legend to Fig 1. Serum samples were collected 28 days post boost (day 0) or 3 days post-challenge (day 3). (A) Antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 NA protein on day 3 post-challenge were determined by ELISA. Anti-M2e (B) and Anti-NP (C) antibodies titers were determined by ELISA. Data represent mean values \u00b1 SEM. These data indicate that sequential infection induced broader and higher amounts of cross- reactive non-neutralizing antibodies than sequential WIV vaccination, while SU vaccination induced only antibodies against hemagglutinin and to a limited extent against neuraminidase. Moreover, responses to live virus and WIV were dominated by IgG2a while responses to SU consisted exclusively of IgG1 antibodies. Sequential infection, WIV and SU vaccination induce different memory T cell immune response Apart from cross-reactive antibody response, cellular immune responses also play an important role in cross-protection. We first evaluated the overall memory T cell responses in spleen and lungs from mice after sequential infections or vaccinations. None of these immunization strategies could significantly enhance the number of memory CD4+CD44+ T cells (p = 0.28) (Fig. 4A). However, numbers of memory CD8+CD44+ T cells were significantly enhanced in spleen (p = 0.028) and lung (p = 0.015) of sequentially infected mice compared with mice of 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 48 09-10-18 09:122Chapter 2 48 vaccination but no IgG2a (Fig. 2B). However, cross-reactive antibodies, irrespective of whether induced by sequential infection or immunization, did not neutralize A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (Fig. 2C).

Mice were primed and boosted as described in the legend to Fig 1. Serum samples were collected 28 days post boost (day 0) or 3 days post-challenge (day 3). (A) Antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 NA protein on day 3 post-challenge were determined by ELISA. Anti-M2e (B) and Anti-NP (C) antibodies titers were determined by ELISA.

We first evaluated the overall memory T cell responses in spleen and lungs from mice after sequential infections or vaccinations. None of these immunization strategies could significantly enhance the number of memory CD4+CD44+ T cells (p = 0.28) (Fig. 4A). However, numbers of memory CD8+CD44+ T cells were significantly enhanced in spleen (p = 0.028) and lung (p = 0.015) of sequentially infected mice compared with mice of 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 49 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 2 50 the unvaccinated group (Fig. 4B). Also, sequential WIV vaccination enhanced memory CD8+CD44+ T cell numbers, however, only in spleen was significance reached (p = 0.02) (Fig. 4B). No increase in the number of memory CD8 T cells was found in the sequential SU vaccination group. Interestingly, while the CD8 memory T cell population in sequentially infected mice consisted of CD62L negative TEM as well as CD62L positive TCM, the majority of memory CD8 T cells from the sequential WIV vaccination group was CD62L positive (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that sequential infection and sequential immunization with WIV are capable of stimulating CD8 memory responses while immunization with SU is not. For detection of influenza specific T cells, splenocytes from sequentially infected or sequentially immunized mice were stimulated overnight with WIV, and IFN production was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining. In live virus infected mice, percentages of IFN producing CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells in spleen and lung were significantly higher than in mock immunized mice (Fig. 5A,p < 0.05). Moreover, around 90% of these IFN-producing CD8 T cells were effector memory cells (data not shown). Also in WIV immunized mice, enhanced percentages of IFN positive CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells were found, yet lower than in the LV group. Significance as compared to PBS control animals was reached only for CD4+ T cells in spleen. Figure 4. Memory T cell immune responses after sequential infection or immunization. Of the mice described in the legend to Fig. 1, 5 animals/group were sacrificed 28 days after the second infection or immunization and spleen and lung were collected.

The influenza-specific CD8 T cells induced by infection or immunization were also enumerated by ELISPOT after stimulation of splenocytes with NP 366-374 (ASNENMDAM) from PR8 virus (the as well as X-31 virus). NP-specific CD8 T cells were detected in the WIV and the sequential infection group, but numbers were around 12 times higher in the latter (Fig. 5B, p = 0.008). Next, we assessed the cross-reactivity of these NP- specific CD8 T cells to A(H1N1)pdm09 NP by staining with tetramers containing the ASENENMETM epitope (from A(H1N1)pdm09 virus). No tetramer positive CD8 T cells were observed in these groups of mice (Fig. 5C) while tetramer positive cells were readily detected in blood of mice infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Figure 5 .

Also, sequential WIV vaccination enhanced memory CD8+CD44+ T cell numbers, however, only in spleen was significance reached (p = 0.02) (Fig. 4B).

(B) On day 28 post the second infection/immunization, NP366-374 of PR8 virus was used to stimulate mouse splenocytes and IFN- producing CD8 T cells were enumerated 52 determined by tetramer assay. Lymphocytes from the blood sample of mice (n=2) infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus served as positive control. Serum antibodies induced by sequential infection are sufficient to provide cross- protection but antibodies induced by WIV vaccination are not Our data show that sequential infection and sequential immunization with WIV could provide protection against severe symptoms upon infection with an A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. To determine the contribution of cross-reactive antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge, serum from sequentially virus infected, WIV vaccinated or PBS control mice was passively transferred to naive mice one day before A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge. Serum from mice vaccinated with WIV derived from A(H1N1)pdm09 virus served as positive control. Mice receiving serum from mice immunized with A(H1N1)pdm09 WIV (positive control, neutralizing titer 330) via adoptive transfer did not show weight loss upon A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge (Fig. 6A) and lung virus titers in these animals were decreased by more than 2 logs compared to the titers in the PBS control group (Fig. 6B, p < 0.01). Similarly, mice receiving serum from the sequential infection group showed no or only mild weight loss. Interestingly, despite the fact that the transferred serum did not contain any neutralizing antibodies, lung virus titers in this group were decreased to the same low level as in mice which had received serum from A(H1N1)pdm09-immunized mice containing neutralizing antibodies. Also serum from the sequential WIV vaccination group provided partial protection; 4 out of 5 mice receiving this serum showed no or mild weight loss, while one mouse went down quickly. Yet, lung virus titers in the WIV vaccination group, though slightly lower, did not differ significantly from those in PBS-treated controls (p = 0.22) (Fig. 6B). These data indicate that non-neutralizing antibodies induced by sequential infection were as effective as neutralizing antibodies induced by A(H1N1)pdm09 WIV vaccination in providing protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge. However, non-neutralizing antibody induced by sequential WIV vaccination were not sufficient to provide full cross-protection. Memory T cells induced by sequential live virus infection or WIV vaccination are involved in cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge To determine the contribution of T cell immune responses to cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, we used CD4 or CD8 specific antibodies to deplete T cells before and during A(H1N1)pdm09 challenge. On day 6 post-challenge, we confirmed that 95% Cross-protection through sequential flu vaccination 53 of CD8 T cells or 96% of CD4 T cells in mice spleen were depleted by this treatment (data not shown). Mice in the PBS mock vaccination group, no matter whether treated with PBS, CD4 depletion antibody or CD8 depletion antibody, showed continuous weight loss after A(H1N1)pdm09 Figure 6. The cross-protective potential of antibodies induced by sequential infection or immunization. Mice (n=5) were primed with PR8 virus (103TCID 50) or PR8 WIV (15\u00b5g) (103TCID 50) or X-31 WIV (15\u00b5g). Mice primed and boosted with PBS served as negative control and mice primed and boosted with A(H1N1)pdm09 WIV (15\u00b5g) served as positive control. Sera from these mice were collected 4 weeks after boost, pooled and injected into na\u00efve mice one day before challenge with A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Body weight loss (A) was monitored daily for 6 days. Virus titers in the lung tissue (B) on day 6 post-challenge were determined by titration on MDCK cells. **, p<0.01, Mann-Whitney U test.

In contrast, mice in the sequential infection group were protected from weight loss and showed low or undetectable lung virus titers (Fig. 7A, LV). Depletion of CD4 T cells in these mice had no effect on protection. Depletion of CD8 T cells in the sequential infection group had some effect on protection from weight loss; on day 6 post A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge 3 out of 6 mice had lost > 6.5 % weight while in non-depleted mice the most severe weight loss was 2.1% and was observed in a single mouse only (Fig. 7A, LV). In addition, lung virus titers were about 1.5 log 10 higher in the CD8-depleted mice than in non-depleted 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 52 09-10-18 09:122Chapter 2 52 determined by tetramer assay.

Mice (n=5) were primed with PR8 virus (103TCID 50) or PR8 WIV (15\u00b5g) (103TCID 50) or X-31 WIV (15\u00b5g). Mice primed and boosted with PBS served as negative control and mice primed and boosted with A(H1N1)pdm09 WIV (15\u00b5g) served as positive control. Sera from these mice were collected 4 weeks after boost, pooled and injected into na\u00efve mice one day before challenge with A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Body weight loss (A) was monitored daily for 6 days. Virus titers in the lung tissue (B) on day 6 post-challenge were determined by titration on MDCK cells. **, p<0.01, Mann-Whitney U test.

In contrast, mice in the sequential infection group were protected from weight loss and showed low or undetectable lung virus titers (Fig. 7A, LV). Depletion of CD4 T cells in these mice had no effect on protection. Depletion of CD8 T cells in the sequential infection group had some effect on protection from weight loss; on day 6 post A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge 3 out of 6 mice had lost > 6.5 % weight while in non-depleted mice the most severe weight loss was 2.1% and was observed in a single mouse only (Fig. 7A, LV). In addition, lung virus titers were about 1.5 log 10 higher in the CD8-depleted mice than in non-depleted 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 53 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 2 54 control mice of the sequential infection group; yet, virus titers were still significantly lower than in non-immunized mice. In the WIV vaccination group, depletion of CD4 or CD8 T cell did not significantly alter the weight loss compared with mock depletion but a strong trend towards less weight loss was observed in mice depleted for CD4 T cells as compared to non-depleted mice of this group (P = 0.054, Fig. 7A, WIV). Depletion of CD4 T cells decreased and depletion of CD8 T cells increased lung virus titers by about 1 log as compared to non-depleted animals on day 6 post challenge but these trends did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 7B, WIV). Moreover, virus titers in WIV-immunized CD8 T cell-depleted mice were of the same magnitude as those in the PBS mock vaccination group. These data above suggests that CD4 memory T cells were most likely not involved in cross- protection while CD8 memory T cells induced by sequential infection or WIV immunization contributed decisively to cross-protection. Figure 7. The cross-protective potential of CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells induced by sequential infection or immunization. Mice were primed with PR8 virus (103TCID 50) or PR8 WIV (15\u00b5g) and virus (103TCID 50) or X-31 WIV (15\u00b5g). Mice primed and boosted with PBS served as control. Anti-CD4, anti-CD8 T cell depletion antibody or PBS were injected intraperitoneally into mice on day -1, 1 and 3 of A(H1N1)pdm09challenge.

Cross-protection through sequential flu vaccination 55 Discussion To determine whether sequential immunization with antigenically distinct traditional vaccines could provide cross-protection, mice were sequentially immunized with WIV or SU vaccines derived from PR8 and X-31 viruses and then challenged with an A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Another group of mice was sequentially infected with sublethal doses of PR8 followed by X-31 prior to A(H1N1)pdm09 virus challenge. We demonstrate that sequential infection provided solid cross-protection which was correlated with cross-protective antibodies and CD8 TEM cells. Sequential vaccination with WIV provided partial cross-protection which also correlated with induction of cross-reactive antibodies and CD8 T cells. Yet, sequential SU vaccination did not provide cross-protection. Neither sequential infection nor sequential immunization resulted in induction of antibodies capable of neutralizing A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Yet, substantial amounts of cross-reactive non- neutralizing antibodies were induced. Previous publications have shown that non-neutralizing antibodies, for example anti-HA stem antibodies, can be induced by sequential infection with antigenically distinct viruses and may provide cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus infection[11,12]. In contrast to these findings, no anti-HA stem antibodies were found in this study. This may be due to the fact that the two virus strains (PR8 and X-31) used for infection/immunization belong to two different phylogenetic groups. The HA-stem regions from PR8 and X-31 virus show low similarity, which might have impaired boosting of HA- stem reactive B cells induced by PR8 through exposure to X-31. Nevertheless, we found cross- reactive antibodies against other conserved proteins in this study. Anti-M2e, anti-NP and anti- NA antibodies were induced by sequential infection and, although to a lesser extent, by sequential WIV immunization. In contrast, sequential SU immunization induced only very moderate amounts of anti-NA antibodies cross-reactive with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Since no neutralizing antibodies were found, the cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies likely are the reason for the cross-protection observed in the serum adoptive transfer experiment. Non-neutralizing antibodies can provide cross-protection via Fc receptor dependent mechanisms (reviewed in [44]). Interestingly, control of lung virus growth by non-neutralizing antibodies evoked by sequential infection with PR8 and X-31 was as effective as by neutralizing antibodies evoked by A(H1N1)pdm09 WIV. Even in absence of antigen-specific T cells, neutralizing antibodies are thus not crucial for protection, suggesting that non-neutralizing antibodies maybe more important for cross-protection than generally thought. Interestingly, recent studies revealed that in humans antibodies cross-reacting with different influenza virus 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 54 09-10-18 09:122Chapter 2 54 control mice of the sequential infection group; yet, virus titers were still significantly lower than in non-immunized mice.

Depletion of CD4 T cells decreased and depletion of CD8 T cells increased lung virus titers by about 1 log as compared to non-depleted animals on day 6 post challenge but these trends did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 7B, WIV). Moreover, virus titers in WIV-immunized CD8 T cell-depleted mice were of the same magnitude as those in the PBS mock vaccination group. These data above suggests that CD4 memory T cells were most likely not involved in cross- protection while CD8 memory T cells induced by sequential infection or WIV immunization contributed decisively to cross-protection.

Interestingly, recent studies revealed that in humans antibodies cross-reacting with different influenza virus 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 55 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 2 56 strains are common and that these antibodies are effectively enhanced by vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccines[45,46]. Hillaire et al and Guo et al have shown that one dose of serum from virus-infected animals could not provide cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in mice[5,6], while Fang et al have shown that four doses of serum could provide cross-protection[3]. These studies imply that the amount of non-neutralizing cross-reactive antibodies may also play an important role in cross-protection. In the present study, cross-reactive antibody titers evoked by sequential WIV immunization were 20-fold lower than those evoked by sequential infection. We thus speculate that antibodies induced by WIV immunization, though in principle cross-protective as indicated by our data, were not present in sufficient amounts to confer complete protection. Although sequential infection and sequential WIV immunization induced virus-specific IFN- producing CD4 T cells, depletion of CD4 T cells in this study did not influence the cross- protection, neither in the sequential infection group nor in the sequential WIV vaccination group. These results contrast with previous findings which indicate that CD4 T cells might play a role in cross-protection[5,6,21]. Hillaire et al reported that na\u00efve mice that received T cells (a mixture of CD4 and CD8 T cells) induced by a single A(H3N2) (HK68) virus infection acquired better cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection than na\u00efve mice that received purified CD8 T cells only[6]. Another study by Guo et al reported that depletion of CD4 T cells induced by a single X-31 virus infection impaired the cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in mice[5]. In this study, not only CD4 T cells, but also robust cross-reactive antibodies and CD8 T cell immune responses were induced by sequential infection. These antibodies or CD8 T cells alone could significantly reduce the virus titer in mice lung in the absence of CD4 T cells. We conclude that CD4 T cell are not essential for cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 during infection in this mouse model. CD8 T cells play an important role in cross-protection. In the present study, depletion of CD8 T cells induced by sequential WIV immunization resulted in lung virus titers similar to those in PBS mock vaccinated mice, implying that CD8 T cells are important for cross-protection induced by sequential WIV immunization. These results agree with those reported by Furuya et al who showed that WIV (prepared by -irradiation) did not provide cross-protection against heterologous virus infection in mice defective in CD8 T cells [47]. Another study by Budimir et al also has shown that depletion of CD8 T cells induced by 2 doses of WIV abolished the cross-protection against heterologous virus challenge[48]. Depletion of CD8 T cells in the sequential infection group prior to A(H1N1)pdm09 challenge had a significant though moderate Cross-protection through sequential flu vaccination 57 effect on lung virus titers. This result implies that in the sequential infection group CD8 T cells do play a role in cross-protection, but team up with other mechanisms, eg antibodies (Fig. 5), to provide full protection. Our findings are also in line with previous publications which demonstrate that CD4 T cells or antibody immune responses are required to cooperate with CD8 T cells for providing optimal cross-protection in live virus infected mice[5,17,49]. The that PR8 NP 366-374 epitope -specific CD8 T cells elicited by PR8 and boosted by X-31 virus or WIV could not recognize the corresponding A(H1N1)pdm09 NP 366-374 epitope. This result is in line with previous findings demonstrating that X-31 NP 366- 374 epitope cannot be recognized by A(H1N1)pdm09 NP-specific CD8 T cells[50]. However, Guo et al have reported that influenza NP and PA proteins from PR8 and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus share many conserved epitopes[50]. It is possible that influenza-specific CD8 T cells against these shared conserved epitopes induced by sequential infection or WIV immunization provided cross-protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus infection. Different phenotypes of memory CD8 T cells show different capacities in cross-protection, for example Wu et al have shown that CD8 TCM induced by influenza virus infection are not required for cross-protection[17]. In the present study, we found that sequential infection mainly induced CD8 TEM. This result is in line with previous findings in mice and humans reporting that a single influenza infection predominantly induces influenza-specific CD8 TEM cells[51][52]. CD8 TEM have been shown to be associated with a fast recall immune response to the infection site, thus providing immediate cross-protection[51]. Interestingly, we found that sequential WIV immunization was more likely to induce CD8 TCM. These cells have shown high proliferation ability in secondary lymphoid organs but to provide delayed cross- protection[53]. Thus, we propose that CD8 TEM in lung and spleen induced by sequential infection provided immediate local antiviral effects, resulting in solid cross-protection. In contrast, CD8 TCM in spleen induced by sequential WIV immunization provided delayed antiviral effects in the lung, resulting in partial cross-protection. In summary, sequential infection with antigenically distinct viruses provided solid cross- protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. Yet, sequential immunization with antigenically distinct SU failed to provide cross-protection. Intriguingly, sequential immunization with antigenically distinct WIV provided partial cross-protection by a mechanism involving cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies as well as CD8+ T cells. These results imply that sequential immunization with WIV prepared from antigenically 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 56 09-10-18 09:122Chapter 2 56 strains are common and that these antibodies are effectively enhanced by vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccines[45,46].

Using WIV as basis we assessed the relative efficacy of different adjuvants by carrying out a head-to-head comparison of the protein-based adjuvants CTA1-DD and CTA1-3M2e-DD and evaluated whether one or more of the adjuvants could induce broadly protective immunity. Mice were immunized with WIV prepared from A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus administered intramuscularly with or without CAF01 or intranasally with or without CAF09, CTA1-DD or CTA1-3M2e-DD, followed by challenge with homologous, heterologous or heterosubtypic virus. In general, intranasal immunizations were significantly more effective than intramuscular immunizations serum IgG, mucosal IgA result, intranasal immunizations with adjuvanted vaccines afforded strong cross-protection associated with less clinical symptoms and control of lung viral load. Mechanistic studies indicated that non-neutralizing IgG antibodies and CD4 T cells were responsible for the improved cross-protection while IgA antibodies were dispensable. The best cross-protection was stimulated by CAF09 and CTA1-3M2e-DD, with the latter also providing CD4 T cell- dependent reduction of lung virus titers. Thus, intranasally administered WIV in combination with effective mucosal adjuvants appears to be a promising candidate for a broadly protective influenza vaccine. WIV and mucosal adjuvants as broadly protective flu vaccines 65 Introduction Vaccination is the cornerstone for the prevention of influenza[1]. Current influenza vaccines predominantly mediate strain specific protection by eliciting neutralizing antibody responses to the globular head region of hemagglutinin (HA), one of the surface glycoproteins of the virus. They do not provide strong heterosubtypic immunity against strains not included in the vaccine [1,2]. Moreover, antigenic drift and antigenic shift regularly lead to the emergence of new strains that are responsible for recurrent epidemics and pose a serious pandemic threat, such as pandemic H1N1(2009) and the potentially pandemic H5N1, H7N9, H10N8 or H5N6 [3-6]. There is therefore an urgent need for universal or broadly protective vaccines against influenza. Whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccines contain all the viral proteins and retain the conformation of native virus particles and as such make a promising basis for a universal influenza vaccine. Moreover, WIV has an intrinsic ability to activate innate immune responses, e.g. antigen presenting cells via Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) signaling [7]. Although WIV was the first vaccine to be used, it was later replaced by split and subunit vaccines that were considered safer [8], despite WIV being superior to both at inducing immune responses in mice and na\u00efve human beings [7,9-12]. Interest has recently refocused on WIV vaccines as studies have shown them capable of inducing a certain degree of cross-protection upon parenteral and mucosal vaccination [3,13-16]. However, a large amount of antigen was required to achieve protection and/or virus challenge was only performed shortly after immunization in these studies [16]. One approach to reduce the dose of WIV needed would be to use adjuvants that might also improve the breadth of the immune responses [17-19]. In this study, we decided to compare the liposome-based adjuvants CAF01 and CAF09 CTA1-3M2e-DD, since these adjuvants have previously been successfully used with several vaccine candidates, including influenza vaccines [20,21,30-37,22-29]. The cationic adjuvant formulations, CAF01 and CAF09, are liposomes 6,6'-dibeheneate as an immunomodulator and is stabilized and (MMG)-1 immunomodulator [20,31]. CAF01 and CAF09 have been shown to generate strong T cell and antibody responses, especially high IgG2a responses for CAF01 [20,21,28]. CAF09 is furthermore capable of inducing potent CD8+ T cell responses against protein and peptide based antigens [24,28,31]. CAF01 can be administered parenterally while CAF09 is administered intraperitoneally or used as 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 64 09-10-18 09:123Chapter 3 64 Abstract Adjuvanted whole inactivated virus (WIV) influenza vaccines show promise as universal influenza vaccine candidates.

CTA1-DD is a fusion protein consisting of the enzymatically active A1 subunit of cholera toxin and a dimer of an Ig binding element from Staphylococcus aureus protein A. It targets the cells of the innate immune system which results in strongly enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses [34-36]. Contrary to whole cholera toxin the mucosal CTA1-DD adjuvant is safe and non-toxic as found in non-human primates and it does not accumulate in the olfactory bulb and nerve following intranasal administration and, hence, cannot cause Bell's palsy [38]. CTA1-3M2e-DD harbors an insert of three copies of the exterior domain of the M2 protein of influenza virus, M2e [33,37]. We compared these adjuvants head-to-head to assess potency in stimulating cross- reactive and cross-protective anti-influenza intranasally (i.n.) with A/PR/8 WIV with or without the different adjuvants and 2 weeks after the final immunization mice were challenged with homologous A/PR/8, heterologous A(H1N1)pdm09 or heterosubtypic X-31 virus to assess protection and several immune parameters. We observed that i.n. administered WIV with the mucosal adjuvants conferred much stronger cross-protection than parenterally administered WIV with or without adjuvant. Studies into the significance of different immune mechanisms for protection revealed that non-neutralizing serum antibodies and CD4 T cells were important for cross-protection while IgA, even when present in high levels, did not play a critical role. Thus, WIV i.n. administered in combination with effective mucosal adjuvants provided the strongest cross-protection against heterosubtypic influenza virus infections and appears to be a promising candidate for a broadly protective influenza vaccine. WIV and mucosal adjuvants as broadly protective flu vaccines 67 METHODS Viruses and vaccines . Live influenza viruses A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), and A/PR/8/34 viruses) were cultured on embryonic chicken eggs and were titrated on MDCK cells and in CB6F1 mice. Whole inactivated virus vaccines (WIV) were prepared from these viruses by inactivation with and the HA content was determined by single radial diffusion assay. Adjuvants. The liposomal adjuvants CAF01 and CAF09 were produced as described previously [39]. The dose for both adjuvants was 300 \u00b5g per 50 \u00b5l for i.m. and 300 \u00b5g per 40 \u00b5l for i.n. administration. For both protein adjuvants, CTA1-DD and CTA1-3M2e-DD, the concentration was 5 WIV. Dulbecco's CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 (DPBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as a diluent. Animal experiments All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Groningen (IACUC-RUG, DEC 6923), or the Central Committee for Animal Experiments CCD of the Netherlands (AVD105002016599), the IACUC of the National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls (NIBSC), Potters Bar, UK, or the IACUC of the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. , The Netherlands. Adjuvant comparison study. Female C57Bl/6 x Balb/c F1 (CB6F1) mice aged 6-8 weeks were purchased from Envigo (The Netherlands). The mice were distributed randomly into groups of six and housed in individually ventilated cages (IVC) at the animal facility, receiving standard water and diet. Group sizes were determined using Piface software aiming at a power of 80%. Mice were vaccinated three times with 0.5 \u00b5g HA of A/PR/8/34 (with or without the adjuvants) on days 0, 10 and 20 as described in Table 1. Mice from groups 1-3 received 50 \u00b5l PBS or vaccine via the intramuscular route (i.m.), administered as 25 \u00b5l per hindlimb. Mice from groups 4-7 received respective vaccines via the intranasal route (i.n.) in a volume of 40 \u00b5l, divided between the two nostrils. Vaccination and virus challenge were carried out under Isoflurane/O 2 anesthesia. Three weeks after the 3rd vaccination (day 41), 6 mice from each group were sacrificed to determine vaccine-induced immune responses. The remaining mice were challenged with 104.4 TCID 50/mouse of chosen on bais of titration experiments in CB6F1 mice). Six mice from each experimental group were sacrificed on day 3 post challenge to assess protection against virus replication in the lungs. The remaining 6 mice were followed until day 10 post challenge to assess clinical symptoms such as weight loss, ruffled fur and activity.

We compared these adjuvants head-to-head to assess potency in stimulating cross- reactive and cross-protective anti-influenza intranasally (i.n.) with A/PR/8 WIV with or without the different adjuvants and 2 weeks after the final immunization mice were challenged with homologous A/PR/8, heterologous A(H1N1)pdm09 or heterosubtypic X-31 virus to assess protection and several immune parameters. We observed that i.n. administered WIV with the mucosal adjuvants conferred much stronger cross-protection than parenterally administered WIV with or without adjuvant. Studies into the significance of different immune mechanisms for protection revealed that non-neutralizing serum antibodies and CD4 T cells were important for cross-protection while IgA, even when present in high levels, did not play a critical role. Thus, WIV i.n. administered in combination with effective mucosal adjuvants provided the strongest cross-protection against heterosubtypic influenza virus infections and appears to be a promising candidate for a broadly protective influenza vaccine. WIV and mucosal adjuvants as broadly protective flu vaccines 67 METHODS Viruses and vaccines . Live influenza viruses A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), and A/PR/8/34 viruses) were cultured on embryonic chicken eggs and were titrated on MDCK cells and in CB6F1 mice. Whole inactivated virus vaccines (WIV) were prepared from these viruses by inactivation with and the HA content was determined by single radial diffusion assay. Adjuvants. The liposomal adjuvants CAF01 and CAF09 were produced as described previously [39]. The dose for both adjuvants was 300 \u00b5g per 50 \u00b5l for i.m. and 300 \u00b5g per 40 \u00b5l for i.n. administration. For both protein adjuvants, CTA1-DD and CTA1-3M2e-DD, the concentration was 5 WIV. Dulbecco's CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 (DPBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as a diluent. Animal experiments All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Groningen (IACUC-RUG, DEC 6923), or the Central Committee for Animal Experiments CCD of the Netherlands (AVD105002016599), the IACUC of the National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls (NIBSC), Potters Bar, UK, or the IACUC of the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. , The Netherlands. Adjuvant comparison study. Female C57Bl/6 x Balb/c F1 (CB6F1) mice aged 6-8 weeks were purchased from Envigo (The Netherlands). The mice were distributed randomly into groups of six and housed in individually ventilated cages (IVC) at the animal facility, receiving standard water and diet. Group sizes were determined using Piface software aiming at a power of 80%. Mice were vaccinated three times with 0.5 \u00b5g HA of A/PR/8/34 (with or without the adjuvants) on days 0, 10 and 20 as described in Table 1. Mice from groups 1-3 received 50 \u00b5l PBS or vaccine via the intramuscular route (i.m.), administered as 25 \u00b5l per hindlimb. Mice from groups 4-7 received respective vaccines via the intranasal route (i.n.) in a volume of 40 \u00b5l, divided between the two nostrils. Vaccination and virus challenge were carried out under Isoflurane/O 2 anesthesia. Three weeks after the 3rd vaccination (day 41), 6 mice from each group were sacrificed to determine vaccine-induced immune responses. The remaining mice were challenged with 104.4 TCID 50/mouse of chosen on bais of titration experiments in CB6F1 mice). Six mice from each experimental group were sacrificed on day 3 post challenge to assess protection against virus replication in the lungs. The remaining 6 mice were followed until day 10 post challenge to assess clinical symptoms such as weight loss, ruffled fur and activity. The humane 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 67 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 3 68 endpoint was set to a loss of 20% of the original weight from the day of challenge. Additionally, for the mechanistic experiments, a score sheet was used to follow the animals. Parameters such as weight loss, appearance (degree of ruffled fur, hunched back) and behavior of the animals (slow movements, difficulty in walking, circling, response to external stimulus) were recorded. These parameters were given scores from 1-4 for least to most severe. A cumulative score for a given day of 10 was considered to be the humane endpoint.

Mice were then challenged with 105.5 TCID 50/mouse of heterosubtypic X-31 virus one day post adoptive transfer. Serum samples from mice immunized with A/PR/8/34 WIV and challenged with A/PR/8/34 live virus WIV and mucosal adjuvants as broadly protective flu vaccines 69 were used as positive control. Animals were followed for 14 days and clinical symptoms were assessed using the scoring system described above. CD4 T cell depletion. Anti-CD4 antibody (200 \u00b5g/injection, clone GK 1.5 (Bioceros, Utrecht, The Netherlands)) was used for in vivo CD4 depletion, which was assessed by staining with FITC-labeled anti-CD4 (clone RM 4.4, Thermo Scientific). Female CB6F1 mice (aged 6-8 weeks) were immunized as described above (groups 1, 4, 5, 7 from Table 1) followed by a heterosubtypic challenge with X-31 virus (105.5 TCID 50/mouse). Mice were injected intraperioneally with the anti-CD4 antibody one day before, one day and seven days after challenge. Six animals/group were sacrificed on day three post challenge for assessment of lung virus titers while the remaining animals were followed for 14 days for clinical symptoms using the scoring system described above. IgA knockout experiment. IgA knock-out mice (IgA KO; Balb/c background, males and females) were obtained from Margaret Conner, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, US and bred at EBM in Gothenburg, Sweden. The mice were immunized as described in Table 1, groups 1, 4, 5 and 7 and challenged with X-31 virus on day 41. Female Balb/c mice were used as wild-type (wt) controls. Clinical symptoms were assessed for 14 days using the scoring system described earlier. Sample collection from mice Before sacrifice, blood was drawn by cheek puncture for determining IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibody titers. Nasal and lung washes were taken using 1 ml PBS (pH 7.4) with Complete\u00ae protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Almere, The Netherlands) for determining IgA titers. Lungs were collected in 1 ml complete EPISERF medium (100 U/ml penicillin, 100mg/ml streptomycin, 12.5 ml of 1 M HEPES, 5 ml of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate for 500 ml medium, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Stadsmeer, The Netherlands) for determination of viral load. Spleens were collected in 1 ml Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) complete medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Stadsmeer, The Netherlands) containing v/v FBS 2- mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands) to assess cellular immune responses. Lung virus titration Virus titration was performed as described previously [40]. Briefly, the lungs were homogenized in 1 ml EPISERF medium and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 minutes to collect the supernatant. These supernatants were used to infect the MDCK cells with serial two fold dilution of the lung supernatants to determine lung virus titers as described before [40].

Assessment of antibody responses Titers IgA, antibodies were determined in blood serum samples taken on day 41, i.e. the day of challenge. IgA was determined in mucosal samples immediately after sample collection. ELISAs were performed as described previously using WIV prepared from each of the challenge viruses, subunit vaccine prepared from X-31, NP protein, or M2e protein for coating [41]. To determine whether the serum antibodies were (cross-)neutralizing, microneutralization assays were performed virus as described previously.[42] LoD for IgG was determined by calculating the log 10 of the 1st dilution while LoD for MN titers was calculated using Log 2 of the 1st dilution. Multifunctional T cell assay To assess the contribution of influenza-specific T cells in protection, a multifunctional T cell assay was performed which involved staining for All reagents, buffers and antibodies were purchased from eBioscience, The Netherlands. Spleens collected in IMDM complete medium were immediately processed and single cell suspensions were obtained using GentleMACS C tubes and GentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, Leiden, The Netherlands). Cell suspensions forced through a cell strainer (BD Bioscience, Breda, The Netherlands) NH KHCO 3, 0.1mM EDTA). Cells were re-stimulated with a A/PR/8/34, for X-31 (University Medical Center Leiden, The Netherlands) in the presence of co-stimulatory anti-CD28 antibody for 16 hours. For each mouse, non-stimulated control cells were used to measure the baseline expression of the cytokines. After 12 hours of incubation, protein transport inhibitor (Thermo Scientific, The Netherlands) was added to stop the transport of proteins out of the Golgi apparatus. Cell stimulation cocktail containing PMA-ionomycin (Thermo Scientific, The Netherlands) was used as a positive control stimulant. Next day, cells were washed once with FACS buffer and stained for surface markers (anti-CD3-Alexa-fluor 700, anti-CD4-FITC, anti-CD8a PerCP-efluor720, all purchased from Thermo Scientific, The Netherlands) for 45 minutes at 4\u00b0C, followed by rinsing with cold PBS and staining with the fixable viability dye eFluor 780 for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. After two washes with FACS buffer, WIV and mucosal adjuvants as broadly protective flu vaccines 71 cells were fixed with fixation buffer and then permeabilized with FACS permeabilization buffer (Thermo anti-IL4 APC, Thermo Scientific) were added to the cells and incubated for 45 minutes. Ultracomp beads (Thermo Scientific, The Netherlands) were used to prepare compensation controls. Events were acquired on an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (Tree Star) was used for analysis. Statistics. For statistical analysis of intercellular cytokine levels, the number of cytokine positive and cytokine negative cells in the stimulated cell populations were compared with paired unstimulated controls using MIMOSA (Mixture Models TNF, IL4 [43]. discovery rate of q0.01 was accepted. A Chi-Squared test was used to compare the number of responders between groups. P-values 0.05 were considered significant.

To assess the protective efficacy of the tested vaccines, challenged mice were followed for weight loss and clinical symptoms for a period of 10 days or until they reached the humane endpoint. Percent weight loss was calculated (Fig. 1a-1c) and survival curves were plotted to indicate dead animals during the follow-up period (Fig. 1d-f). Furthermore, to assess viral loads in the lungs, mock vaccinated and WIV vaccinated animals were sacrificed three days after homologous, heterologous or heterosubtypic virus challenge (Fig. 1g-i). Upon A/PR/8/34 challenge, all mock immunized mice reached the humane endpoint (>20% weight loss) and had to be sacrificed. Mice from all groups immunized three times with WIV, with or without the adjuvants, were completely protected from weight loss following challenge with homologous A/PR/8/34 virus (Fig. 1a, 1d). Furthermore, all but one (with low titer) of the vaccinated mice were completely protected from virus replication in the lungs (Fig. 1g). After challenge with heterologous A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, mock immunized animals gradually lost weight and had to be sacrificed upon reaching the humane endpoint by day 6 or 7. Animals vaccinated with non-adjuvanted WIV i.m. showed some weight loss but all survived until the end of the study. Surprisingly, mice immunized i.m. with CAF01 adjuvanted vaccine lost weight rather rapidly and 2 out of 6 mice had to be sacrificed (Fig.1b, 1e). Animals vaccinated i.n. with WIV alone exhibited little weight loss except for one animal which reached the humane endpoint on day 5. Mice vaccinated with WIV plus mucosal adjuvants presented the best cross- protection against heterologous virus challenge: they showed little or no weight loss and all animals survived (Fig.1b, 1e). Although not significant lung virus titers were somewhat higher in well protected than in unprotected unimmunized mice (Fig. 1h). WIV and mucosal adjuvants as broadly protective flu vaccines 73 Figure 1. Adjuvanted i.n. administered vaccine provides best protection. CB6F1 mice were vaccinated thrice ten days apart with PBS, non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted WIV vaccines. Three weeks after the last vaccination 6 mice/group were challenged with homologous A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (a, d, g), heterologous A(H1N1)pdm09 (b, e, h) or heterosubtypic X-31 (H3N2) viruses (c, f, i).

Sera, nasal and lung washes were collected three weeks after the 3rd immunization for antibody titer assessments, while T cell responses against heterologous A(H1N1)pdm09 and heterosubtypic X-31 virus were determined using spleens of vaccinated animals three days post the heterosubtypic challenge infection. The results of immunoprofiling for the heterologous and heterosubtypic challenge experiments are summarized as heatmaps (Fig. 2a, b) to reveal patterns correlating with protection; the individual data can be found in the supplementary information (Fig. S1 -S5). a b Figure 2. Immunoprofiling against heterologous and heterosubtypic viruses. Animals were vaccinated 3 times with the vaccines indicated in Table 1. After 3 vaccinations, sera, nasal and lung washes and spleens were collected to determine systemic, mucosal and cell mediated immune responses (n=6). Some animals were challenged with heterologous (a) and heterosubtypic (b) virus to determine protection, lung viral load (n=6) and survival (n=6). Generated data was used as an input and conditional formatting was performed in Ms Excel to plot heatmaps. Each column represents one animal. Survival is shown with different color scheme as these are different animals compared to the rest. Dark blue indicates worst survival while light blue indicates best survival. For other parameters, heatmaps ranges from red (lowest response) to green (best response). WIV and mucosal adjuvants as broadly protective flu vaccines 75 Intramuscular immunization with A/PR/8/34 WIV reliably induced neutralizing antibodies against the homologous virus, especially when given with adjuvant (Fig. S1a). By contrast, i.n. immunizations poorly stimulated neutralizing antibodies, even in the presence of adjuvants. Importantly, we found no neutralizing antibodies against heterologous A(H1N1)pdm09 or heterosubtypic X-31 virus irrespective of the immunization route or adjuvant used (Fig. 2a- b, Fig. S1b, c). However, all immunized mice developed serum IgG antibodies reactive with homologous, as well as heterologous and heterosubtypic virus and these titers were of identical magnitude for all three virus strains (Fig. 2a-b, Fig S1d-f). The addition of both IgG1 and IgG2a. CTA1-DD and CTA1-3M2e-DD were comparatively less effective in stimulating IgG and IgG1 and had only minor effects on IgG2a levels (Fig. 2a-b, Fig. S2a-b). Furthermore, we wanted to identify the antigens targeted by the cross-reactive IgG. Use of subunit vaccine for coating revealed that vaccine-evoked, cross-reactive antibodies readily bound to viral surface proteins. These antibodies were found in all i.m. immunized mice, but were present in i.n. immunized mice only when adjuvanted vaccine was used (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S2c). Anti-NP antibodies were detected only in mice vaccinated with WIV plus CAF01 and one mouse from the WIV plus CAF09 group (Fig. 2a, b, S2d). Anti-M2e antibodies induced only by WIV adjuvanted with CTA1-3M2e-DD (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S2e). Vaccination, especially when done with adjuvanted vaccines, therefore induced cross-reactive antibodies which mainly targeted the viral surface proteins. The levels of these antibodies correlated with protection from severe disease, except in the group i.m. adjuvanted with CAF01-adjuvanted vaccine. Determination of influenza specific mucosal IgA revealed that mice from the PBS control group as well as mice i.m. immunized with non-adjuvanted or CAF01-adjuvanted WIV developed no or very low mucosal IgA responses (in nose and lungs) against any of the viruses (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S3 a, b, c). In contrast, all mice i.n. immunized with adjuvanted WIV produced significant levels of specific IgA antibodies in both nose and lungs against all three virus strains, and these levels were significantly higher than in mice i.n. immunized with non-adjuvanted WIV. Therefore, mucosal immunization in the presence of adjuvant was required for successful induction of cross-reactive mucosal IgA (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S3 a, b, c). IgA titers strongly correlated with protection from weight loss (Fig. 2a, b). 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 74 09-10-18 09:123Chapter 3 74 Immuno-profiling reveals strong correlation between survival and serum antibodies, mucosal IgA and IFN+ CD4 T cells To determine which immune mechanisms correlated with the observed cross-protection and to what degree these mechanisms would differ for the different adjuvanted vaccines, various immunological assays were performed. Sera, nasal and lung washes were collected three weeks after the 3rd immunization for antibody titer assessments, while T cell responses against heterologous A(H1N1)pdm09 and heterosubtypic X-31 virus were determined using spleens of vaccinated animals three days post the heterosubtypic challenge infection. The results of immunoprofiling for the heterologous and heterosubtypic challenge experiments are summarized as heatmaps (Fig. 2a, b) to reveal patterns correlating with protection; the individual data can be found in the supplementary information (Fig. S1 -S5). a b Figure 2. Immunoprofiling against heterologous and heterosubtypic viruses. Animals were vaccinated 3 times with the vaccines indicated in Table 1. After 3 vaccinations, sera, nasal and lung washes and spleens were collected to determine systemic, mucosal and cell mediated immune responses (n=6). Some animals were challenged with heterologous (a) and heterosubtypic (b) virus to determine protection, lung viral load (n=6) and survival (n=6). Generated data was used as an input and conditional formatting was performed in Ms Excel to plot heatmaps. Each column represents one animal. Survival is shown with different color scheme as these are different animals compared to the rest. Dark blue indicates worst survival while light blue indicates best survival. For other parameters, heatmaps ranges from red (lowest response) to green (best response). WIV and mucosal adjuvants as broadly protective flu vaccines 75 Intramuscular immunization with A/PR/8/34 WIV reliably induced neutralizing antibodies against the homologous virus, especially when given with adjuvant (Fig. S1a). By contrast, i.n. immunizations poorly stimulated neutralizing antibodies, even in the presence of adjuvants. Importantly, we found no neutralizing antibodies against heterologous A(H1N1)pdm09 or heterosubtypic X-31 virus irrespective of the immunization route or adjuvant used (Fig. 2a- b, Fig. S1b, c). However, all immunized mice developed serum IgG antibodies reactive with homologous, as well as heterologous and heterosubtypic virus and these titers were of identical magnitude for all three virus strains (Fig. 2a-b, Fig S1d-f). The addition of both IgG1 and IgG2a. CTA1-DD and CTA1-3M2e-DD were comparatively less effective in stimulating IgG and IgG1 and had only minor effects on IgG2a levels (Fig. 2a-b, Fig. S2a-b). Furthermore, we wanted to identify the antigens targeted by the cross-reactive IgG. Use of subunit vaccine for coating revealed that vaccine-evoked, cross-reactive antibodies readily bound to viral surface proteins. These antibodies were found in all i.m. immunized mice, but were present in i.n. immunized mice only when adjuvanted vaccine was used (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S2c). Anti-NP antibodies were detected only in mice vaccinated with WIV plus CAF01 and one mouse from the WIV plus CAF09 group (Fig. 2a, b, S2d). Anti-M2e antibodies induced only by WIV adjuvanted with CTA1-3M2e-DD (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S2e). Vaccination, especially when done with adjuvanted vaccines, therefore induced cross-reactive antibodies which mainly targeted the viral surface proteins. The levels of these antibodies correlated with protection from severe disease, except in the group i.m. adjuvanted with CAF01-adjuvanted vaccine. Determination of influenza specific mucosal IgA revealed that mice from the PBS control group as well as mice i.m. immunized with non-adjuvanted or CAF01-adjuvanted WIV developed no or very low mucosal IgA responses (in nose and lungs) against any of the viruses (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S3 a, b, c). In contrast, all mice i.n. immunized with adjuvanted WIV produced significant levels of specific IgA antibodies in both nose and lungs against all three virus strains, and these levels were significantly higher than in mice i.n. immunized with non-adjuvanted WIV. Therefore, mucosal immunization in the presence of adjuvant was required for successful induction of cross-reactive mucosal IgA (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S3 a, b, c). IgA titers strongly correlated with protection from weight loss (Fig. 2a, b). 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 75 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 3 76 We next assessed vaccine-induced T cell responses. In vitro re-stimulation of splenocytes with heterologous or heterosubtypic i.n. immunized with non-adjuvanted WIV developed no or very low levels of IFN-producing CD4 T cells. Mice immunized i.n. with adjuvanted WIV demonstrated enhancement of IFN- producing cells, with CTA1-3M2e-DD being most potent. In addition to IFN, we also measured IL2 and TNF responses in CD4+ T cells, but although restimulation with WIV and peptides increased the numbers of T cells producing these cytokines, the percentages were low and no significant differences between immunized and mock-immunized animals were observed (results not shown). The large majority of vaccine-specific CD4 T cells produced IFN, while very few cells were multifunctional, also producing other cytokines (Fig. S5). In contrast to CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells were not induced at significant numbers by any of the vaccines (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S4c, d). In conclusion, IFN-producing CD4 T cells were the only T cell population induced and their numbers were enhanced significantly by adjuvanted WIV administered i.n. Protection from weight loss correlated well with the number of IFN- producing CD4 T cells (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S4a, b). Dissecting the mechanisms of protection From the heatmaps it can be deduced that protection from heterologous and heterosubtypic virus challenge correlated with serum IgG antibody titers (with the exception of the CAF01 group), mucosal IgA, and CD4 T cells. We next performed a series of experiments in order to determine whether any of these factors was critical for protection from heterosubtypic virus infection. For these experiments we focused on CAF09 and CTA1-3M2e-DD as the most successful adjuvants from the previous experiment and used PBS and non-adjuvanted WIV as controls. Figure 3. Serum antibodies induced by mucosally adjuvanted WIV might induce cross-protection. Serum was WIV, WIV+ in na\u00efve mice (n=6) via the i.p. route. One day after passive immunization animals were challenged with heterosubtypic X-31 virus. Animals from WIV and mucosal adjuvants as broadly protective flu vaccines 77 the positive control group received PR8 immune sera and were challenged with homologous A/PR/8/34 virus. Then the mice were followed for survival (a) and clinical symptoms (b) assessed using a score form based on weight, appearance and behavior. To assess if serum antibodies can mediate cross-protection, mice were passively immunized via the i.p. route with serum collected from animals i.n. administered with PBS, WIV, WIV+CAF09 or WIV+CTA1-3M2e-DD. One day later they were challenged with heterosubtypic X-31 virus. Animals which received A/PR/8 immune serum followed by a homologous challenge with A/PR/8 served as positive control group. Mice were followed daily for clinical symptoms using a score sheet which takes into account weight loss, appearance (ruffled fur, hunched posture), and behavior (slow movements, responsiveness to triggers etc). We found that A/PR/8 immune serum completely protected mice against A/PR/8 infection. Serum from mice i.n. immunized with A/PR/8 WIV without adjuvant could not provide protection against infection with heterosubtypic X-31 virus and the mice transfused with this serum exhibited high clinical scores and reduced survival (Fig. 3a, b). By contrast, serum from mice immunized with WIV plus CAF09 or CTA1-3M2e-DD protected effectively and clinical scores were reduced by 50% compared to unprotected control mice. Thus, non-neutralizing serum IgG antibodies cross-protection against heterosubtypic X-31 virus. Figure 4. CD4 depletion does not affect protection but affects virus growth. Mice (n=12/group) were vaccinated thrice i.n. with PBS (a, e), non-adjuvanted (b, f), WIV+ CAF09 (c, g) or WIV+ CTA1-3M2e-DD (d, h) followed by heterosubtypic challenge. On day -1, 1 and 7 relative to the challenge, anti-CD4 antibody or PBS was i.p. administered in vaccinated animals. Mice were followed 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 76 09-10-18 09:123Chapter 3 76 We next assessed vaccine-induced T cell responses. In vitro re-stimulation of splenocytes with heterologous or heterosubtypic i.n. immunized with non-adjuvanted WIV developed no or very low levels of IFN-producing CD4 T cells.

In contrast to CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells were not induced at significant numbers by any of the vaccines (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S4c, d). In conclusion, IFN-producing CD4 T cells were the only T cell population induced and their numbers were enhanced significantly by adjuvanted WIV administered i.n. Protection from weight loss correlated well with the number of IFN- producing CD4 T cells (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S4a, b). Dissecting the mechanisms of protection From the heatmaps it can be deduced that protection from heterologous and heterosubtypic virus challenge correlated with serum IgG antibody titers (with the exception of the CAF01 group), mucosal IgA, and CD4 T cells. We next performed a series of experiments in order to determine whether any of these factors was critical for protection from heterosubtypic virus infection. For these experiments we focused on CAF09 and CTA1-3M2e-DD as the most successful adjuvants from the previous experiment and used PBS and non-adjuvanted WIV as controls. Figure 3.

Serum from mice i.n. immunized with A/PR/8 WIV without adjuvant could not provide protection against infection with heterosubtypic X-31 virus and the mice transfused with this serum exhibited high clinical scores and reduced survival (Fig. 3a, b).

Thus, non-neutralizing serum IgG antibodies cross-protection against heterosubtypic X-31 virus. Figure 4. CD4 depletion does not affect protection but affects virus growth. Mice (n=12/group) were vaccinated thrice i.n. with PBS (a, e), non-adjuvanted (b, f), WIV+ CAF09 (c, g) or WIV+ CTA1-3M2e-DD (d, h) followed by heterosubtypic challenge. On day -1, 1 and 7 relative to the challenge, anti-CD4 antibody or PBS was i.p. administered in vaccinated animals. Mice were followed 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 77 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 3 78 for 14 days for survival (a-d) and clinical symptoms (e-h). Dotted lines in e-h indicate the humane endpoint. Six animals/ group were sacrificed on day 3 post challenge to determine lung virus titers (Fig. 4i). LoD is indicated by dashed line. Mock depletion is presented by filled symbols with - and CD4 depletion is represented by open symbols with +. Virus titers are represented as log 10 titers /gram of lung with level of significance as *p<.05 calculated using Mann-Whitney U-test. Next, we studied the role of CD4+ T cells in protection. Depletion of CD4 T cells was achieved through anti-CD4 Mab-treatment of the mice and resulted in reduction of CD4 T cell numbers in peripheral blood by >95%. We found that CD4 depletion did not affect survival (Fig. 4b-d) or clinical scores (Fig. 4e-h) upon X-31 virus infection in the well immunized animals. Yet, CD4 T cell depletion had a dramatic effect on lung virus titers in animals immunized with WIV and CTA1-3M2e-DD while all other immunization protocols showed comparable lung virus titers irrespective of CD4 depletion (Fig. 4i). Therefore, CD4 T cells, appeared to play an important role in protection against heterobsubtypic challenge only in the CTA1-3M2e-DD group. Finally, we addressed whether cross-reactive local IgA antibodies impacted on resistance against infection in the i.n well immunized mice by repeating the immunization/challenge experiment in IgA KO mice. In line with reports in literature, we found that mock-immunized IgA KO mice were more susceptible to influenza infection than mock-immunized wt Balb/c mice, demonstrated by higher clinical scores and the necessity for euthanasia.[44] Wild-type Balb/c mice immunized with non-adjuvanted WIV demonstrated reduced clinical scores as compared to non-immunized Balb/c mice but this was not the case for IgA KO mice indicating a role for IgA in protection. (Fig. 5a, e) (Fig. 5b, f). When immunized with WIV and any of the mucosal adjuvants, wt and IgA KO mice developed protective immunity and survived the challenge infection (Fig.5c, d, g, h). Clinical scores of IgA KO mice immunized with CAF09 adjuvanted vaccine were higher than those of wt mice (Fig. 5 g). Mice immunized with CTA1- 3M2e-DD adjuvanted WIV developed the lowest clinical scores with little difference between wt and IgA KO mice (Fig. 5 h). These results suggest that local IgA antibodies exerted some protection from severe disease but were not critical for survival in this model. WIV and mucosal adjuvants as broadly protective flu vaccines 79 Figure 5. IgA antibodies are not critical in cross-protection. IgA KO mice and Balb/c mice were vaccinated thrice i.n. with PBS (a, e), non-adjuvanted WIV (b, f), WIV+CAF-09 (c, g) or WIV+CTA1- 3M2e-DD (d, h) followed by heterosubtypic challenge. Then the mice were followed for survival (a- d)) and development of clinical symptoms (e-h) for a period of 14 days.

In addition, we dissected which immune parameters contributed to protection and to what extent these would be vaccine-specific. The results indicate that i.n. administered WIV combined with a mucosal adjuvant provided enhanced cross-protection compared to WIV i.m. administered with or without adjuvant and i.n. WIV. and IFN- producing CD4 T were significantly higher for mice i.n immunized with WIV plus adjuvant than for the other less well protected groups. Whereas, non-neutralizing serum IgG antibodies and CD4 T cells were clearly contributing to protection our experiments in IgA KO mice were less conclusive, but there was a trend towards a protective effect of local IgA on the clinical symptoms. Mucosal immunization has been shown to be superior to parenteral immunization for stimulating local immunity and resident memory T cells in the lung [45-47] and to provide cross-protection against heterosubtypic virus challenge [14,48]. In agreement with these studies, we found that i.n immunization with adjuvanted WIV afforded stronger cross- protection than parenteral immunizations. This was the case even though serum anti-viral IgG levels appeared quite comparable for mice i.m. or i.n. immunized with adjuvanted vaccines. Upon heterologous infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, clinical symptoms and survival correlated poorly with virus replication in the lungs while for heterosubtypic infection with X- 31 virus we observed a clear correlation between clinical scores and lung virus titers. There is evidence that the kinetics of virus replication differ for the two virus strains with H1N1pdm09 peaking on day 7 and X-31 virus peaking on day 3. We determined lung virus titers on day 3 post infection which might have been optimal for X-31 virus but too early for A(H1N1)pm09 virus [49,50]. Adjuvanted WIV vaccines induced significantly higher systemic immune responses compared to non-adjuvanted WIV. Interestingly, the levels of serum IgG antibodies reacting with homologous, heterologous and heterosubtypic WIV in ELISA assays were rather similar, suggesting that most of the IgG antibodies induced by immunization with WIV were cross- reactive. This is in line with recent observations in humans that also indicate that many influenza-specific antibodies, whether measured before or after vaccination, are cross-reactive [51,52]. Although serum antibodies induced by they could WIV and mucosal adjuvants as broadly protective flu vaccines 81 not neutralize heterologous and heterosubtypic virus in vitro , which was according to expectations [42,53]. Nevertheless, when transferred to na\u00efve animals these antibodies provided partial protection against X-31 challenge. It has been shown that anti-influenza antibodies can mediate cross-protection via non-neutralizing mechanisms such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis, or complement mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) [54-57]. Which of these mechanisms, if any, is involved in protection afforded by WIV adjuvanted with CAF09 or CTA1-3M2e-DD remains to be elucidated. Vaccination with WIV plus mucosal adjuvants also led to remarkably enhanced levels of cross- reactive local IgA in the lungs and nose of mice. IgA has been shown to be more cross-reactive than IgG [58,59]. Moreover, Maurer et al have recently shown that IgA antibodies can also neutralize influenza virus in an antigen-aspecific manner by providing sialic acid in the glycosylated Fc part which serves as a decoy receptor not only for influenza virus but also for other viruses using sialic acid as a receptor [60]. However, in our study adjuvanted i.n. administered WIV completely protected IgA KO mice from reaching the humane endpoint upon heterosubtypic challenge, similar to wt Balb/c mice. Neverthelss, we cannot exclude that local IgA antibodies exerted some protective function, as reflected in the higher clinical scores in immunized and challenged IgA KO mice compared to the wt mice. Whether local IgA plays a role in cross-protection induced by i.n. administered adjuvanted WIV or not is controversial. For example, Zhang et al [61]. showed that i.n. immunization with a CTB/CT-adjuvanted subunit vaccine stimulated equally efficient control of virus growth in wt and IgA KO mice. Yet, using mice deficient in the poly Ig receptor and thus unable to transport IgA across the respiratory epithelium, Asahi et al demonstrated that mucosal IgA is critical, in particular for protection from heterologous virus challenge [62]. IFN-producing cross-reactive CD4 positive T cells increased significantly upon mucosal vaccination, especially in mice immunized with WIV plus CTA1-3M2e-DD. This could be due to the fact that M2e contains an MHC class II restricted CD4 helper epitope [33]. CD4 depletion shortly before and after challenge did not affect survival, but impaired the control of lung virus growth in animals vaccinated with WIV plus CTA1-3M2e-DD, indicating a role of CD4 T cells in controling virus growth rather than controlling clinical symptoms and in turn survival. CAF09-adjuvanted WIV did not induce significant numbers of CD4 T cells and accordingly, depletion of CD4 T cells during infection did not affect clinical scores or lung virus titers. We did not observe IFN-producing CD8 T cells induced by vaccination. This was somewhat unexpected since at least CAF01, CAF09, and CTA1-DD are known to support induction of CD8 T cells [24,28,31,63]. Failure to detect CD8 T cells in our experiments might be because 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 80 09-10-18 09:123Chapter 3 80 DISCUSSION In this study, we compared liposome and protein adjuvants head-to-head to assess their relative efficacy in inducing cross-reactive immunity in mice, when combined with i.m. and i.n. administered WIV.

Failure to detect CD8 T cells in our experiments might be because 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 81 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 3 82 they were indeed absent or because we missed them due to the timing of the experiments. We assessed CD8 T cell responses on day 25 after the last immunization, by which time the cells were already through the retraction phase and the numbers might therefore have been too low to detect. Furthermore, we used intracellular cytokine staining, a method which allows simultanous determination of multiple cell populations and cytokines but is not as sensitive as ELISPOT assay for the detection of CD8 T cells. Despite the fact that we did not find them, we cannot categorically rule out that CD8 T cells contributed to protection. It is known that lung tissue resident memory (TRM) CD8 T cells have an important role in protection from influenza infection [64,65]. These cells might indeed have been induced in our experiments, but as parts of the lungs had to be used for other purposes and the remaining tissues were insufficient for isolating the required numbers of lymphocytes, we were unable to investigate them. Follow up studies will address this issue. Although WIV plus CAF01 induced the highest levels of cross-reactive antibodies, mice in the respective experimental group showed severe clinical symptoms and reduced survival upon challenge. One thing which distinguished the CAF01 vaccinated mice group from the other groups was the induction of anti-NP antibodies. In a pre-clinical study in pigs by Ricklin et al, NP vaccination led on the one hand to a strong immune response but on the other hand induced lung inflammation, and immunized pigs were not protected.[66] In murine models the situation is not entirely clear. Although it has been shown that anti-NP antibodies can confer resistance to influenza virus infection [67-69] (contrary to our results), a previous study from our group demonstrated that mice vaccinated with NP adjuvanted with MPLA (which developed NP- specific antibodies) showed a more rapid weight loss in the initial phase of infection than mock vaccinated mice [70]. Furthermore, animals receiving a virosomal vaccine without NP showed fewer signs of illness compared to mice receiving a virosomal vaccine with NP. The results of our head-to-head comparison of different vaccines underline that mucosal immunization with adjuvanted WIV is indeed a promising approach for developing a broadly protective influenza vaccine. Several immune mechanisms appear to contribute to cross- protection induced upon mucosal vaccination with adjuvanted WIV and optimal protection seems to require a combination of different mechanisms.

However, influenza NP protein alone cannot induce CTL immunity due to its low capacity to activate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and get access to the MHC class I antigen processing pathway. Methods: To facilitate the generation of NP-specific CTL immunity we developed a novel influenza vaccine consisting of virosomes with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligand monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and the metal-ion-chelating lipid incorporated in the membrane. Results: In vitro , virosomes with incorporated MPLA induced stronger of APCs unadjuvanted virosomes. Virosomes modified with DOGS-NTA-Ni showed high conjugation efficacy for his-tagged proteins and facilitated efficient uptake of conjugated proteins by APCs. Immunization of mice with MPLA-adjuvanted virosomes with attached NP resulted in priming of NP-specific CTLs while MPLA-adjuvanted virosomes with admixed NP were inefficient in priming CTLs. Both vaccines induced equally high titers of NP-specific antibodies. When challenged with heterosubtypic influenza virus, mice immunized with virosomes with attached or admixed NP were protected from severe weight loss. Yet, unexpectedly, they showed more weight loss and more severe disease symptoms than mice immunized with MPLA-virosomes without NP. Conclusions: Taken together, these results indicate that virosomes with conjugated antigen and adjuvant incorporated in the membrane are effective in priming of CTLs and eliciting antigen- specific antibody responses in vivo .

Introduction Influenza A virus infections cause considerable mortality and morbidity to the human population during seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. Depending on the sequence of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) carried on the surface of the virus particle, influenza A virus can be divided into various subtypes. During seasonal epidemics, caused by H1N1 or H3N2 viruses, 5-10% of the worldwide population is infected, resulting in 3-5 million people suffering from severe illness and up to 500,000 deaths per year[1,2]. During the last influenza pandemic caused by H1N1pdm virus in 2009, it was estimated that the overall cumulative incidence of infection was 24% and as many as 284,500 people succumbed to H1N1pdm-related illness[3,4] Additionally, avian influenza viruses, such as H7N9 and H5N1, are also reported to cause high mortality in humans yet do not transmit efficiently from human to human[5,6]. Vaccination is the primary strategy to prevent influenza virus infection. Currently, licensed influenza vaccines include whole inactivated influenza virus, split virus, subunit and virosomal vaccines[7]. These vaccines mainly induce influenza strain-specific antibodies which can bind to the virus surface proteins, HA and NA. However, due to the high variability of HA and NA the vaccines need to be reformulated each year to match the circulating influenza virus strains but still they are unable to protect against newly emerging strains. An influenza vaccine which can induce cross-protective immune responses to diverse influenza virus strains is therefore urgently needed. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) to conserved influenza virus antigens, such as nucleoprotein (NP), are required for optimal cross-protective immune responses [8-10]. Influenza virus- specific CTLs can clear virus-infected cells and subsequently stop virus replication and virus spread in the body. Therefore, inducing CTLs to conserved influenza virus protein is an attractive approach for eliciting cross-protective immunity against various influenza virus strains. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) play a key role in priming CTL responses 11. Priming of CTLs by non-replicating vaccines and by pathogens which do not infect APCs directly, relies on a mechanism called cross-presentation[12]. Cross-presentation requires uptake by APCs of sufficient amounts of antigen which can enter the MHC class I processing and presentation pathway as well as proper activation of the APCs to trigger physiological processes involved in cross-presentation [11,12]. A conserved protein, such as NP, alone is thus ineffective in 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 92 09-10-18 09:124Chapter 4 92 Abstract (CTLs) to conserved internal influenza antigens, such as nucleoprotein (NP), is a promising strategy for the development of cross- protective influenza vaccines.

A conserved protein, such as NP, alone is thus ineffective in 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 93 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 4 94 inducing CD8+ T cell immunity due to its low capacity to reach the MHC class I processing pathway and its inability to activate APCs [13,14]. Uptake of antigen by APCs can be facilitated by use of a delivery system. Influenza virosomes are reconstituted viral membrane envelopes which consist only of the membrane lipids and the surface proteins of influenza virus. Virosomes retain the cell binding and membrane fusion abilities of the live virus. Due to these properties, virosomes can deliver encapsulated cargo to the cytosol of APCs and subsequently induce CTL responses[15]. However, only limited amounts of protein can be encapsulated into virosomes when adding the protein during virosome reconstitution[16]. Moreover, due to a lack of adjuvant virosomes are inefficient in activating APCs and thus in triggering cross-presentation, which limits the induction of CTL immunity[17]. Increasing the amount of antigen associated with the virosomes and adding an adjuvant to enable APC activation and thus improve cross-presentation may significantly enhance the induction of CTLs. In this study, we used two strategies to modify influenza virosomes to overcome the above- mentioned drawbacks. Firstly, a nickel-chelating lipid was incorporated into the lipid bilayer of influenza virosomes. The presence of nickel-carrying lipids facilitates binding of large amounts of histidine (his)-tagged protein to the surface of lipid-based carriers [18]. Secondly, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), a Toll-like ligand, was incorporated into the virosomal membrane[19]. TLR 4 engagement on APCs not only results in activation of the cells but can also promote cross-presentation[20,21]. These novel 'all-in-one' influenza virosome particles, with his-tagged NP attached to the membrane and incorporated MPLA, were tested in vitro and in vivo. MPLA-adjuvanted virosomes as cross-protective flu vaccine 95 2. Material and Methods 2.1 Material Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), 1,2-dihexanoylan-glyero-3-phosphocholine succinyl] (DOGS-NTA) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 2.2 Expression and purification of his-tagged recombinant proteins Recombinant pET32a-NP and pET32a-EGFP plasmids were generated by inserting the NP gene derived from A/Hongkong/2/1968 (H3N2, called HK68 in the following) or the gene encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) into vector pET32a (Merck Millipore, Germany). The recombinant plasmids were transfected into competent E. coli AD494 (Merck Millipore, Germany) and the cells were cultured in LB broth supplemented with ampicillin and kanamycin. When an OD 600 of 0.8 was reached, 0.5 mM isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to induce the expression of the his-tagged proteins. His-tagged proteins were purified by Ni-chelate affinity resin (Merck Millipore, Germany). Briefly, BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Merck Millipore, Germany) with 6 M urea was used for lysis of transfected E.coli . Ni-NTA resin was equilibrated with binding buffer (0.1 M HEPES, 0.5 M NaCl) and then incubated with E.coli lysate at 4 oC overnight with rotation. The resin column was then washed twice with washing buffer (0.1 M HEPES, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole). Then, 1.8 ml of elution buffer (0.1 M HEPES, 0.5 M NaCl, 400 mM imidazole) with 6 M urea were added and incubated with the column at room temperature for 10 min. After that, the eluted samples were collected and the presence of his-tagged protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% gel stained with Coomassie blue. The purity of the proteins was more than 90% (supplementary Figure S1). An endotoxin removal resin column Thermo Fisher, Germany was used to remove residual endotoxin from these proteins. Determination of residual endotoxin revealed that 99% of endotoxin was removed by this procedure. After that, proteins were dialyzed against HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; 5 mM HEPES, 3 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, PH 7.4) to remove imidazole and urea. The concentrations of the proteins were determined by micro-Lowry[22]. The purified proteins were stored at 4oC until use. 2.3 Influenza virus and cell culture 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 94 09-10-18 09:124Chapter 4 94 inducing CD8+ T cell immunity due to its low capacity to reach the MHC class I processing pathway and its inability to activate APCs [13,14].

The purified proteins were stored at 4oC until use. 2.3 Influenza virus and cell culture 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 95 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 4 96 A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1, Biologicals (Weesp, the Netherlands). A/HongKong/2/1968 (H3N2, HK68 in the following) virus for mouse challenge was kindly provided by Guus F. Rimmelzwaan (Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). by incubation with 0.1% - propiolactone (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Geel, Belgium) in citrate buffer (125 mM sodiumcitrate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 8.2) at 4\u00b0C with rotation. RAW-BlueTM cells were purchased from InvivoGen (InvivoGen, USA) and maintained according to the manufacturer`s protocol. 2.4 Preparation of modified influenza virosomes Influenza virosomes were prepared from inactivated NC99 influenza virus according to the protocol published before with some modification[23,24]. Briefly, DOGS-NTA-Ni or DOGS- NTA, dissolved in chloroform, were mixed with MPLA, dissolved in ethanol, at a ratio of 100 nmol DOGS:100 \u00b5g MPLA. The solvents were dried under a stream of nitrogen and the lipid film was further dried under vacuum in a SpeedVac centrifuge for 3 h. Meanwhile, inactivated influenza virus was disrupted with 0.1 mM DCPC in HBS and the nucleocapsid was removed by ultracentrifugation. The supernatant containing the viral surface proteins and membrane lipids (1 \u00b5mol phospholipids) was collected and was incubated with the dried film of lipid (containing MPLA and DOGS lipids) at room temperature for half an hour on ice. Tubes were inverted every 5 min to dissolve the lipid mixtures. Modified virosomes were reconstituted by removal of DCPC by dialysis against HBS buffer overnight with Slide-A-Lyzer Mini Dialysis Devices (10K MWCO) (Thermo Fisher, Germany). The buffer was changed on the second day for another 4 hours of dialysis. Non-incorporated material was removed from the virosomes on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (10-30-50%, w/v). Subsequently, the sucrose in the virosomes was removed by dialysis against HBS. The concentration of virosomal proteins was determined by micro-Lowry. These modified virosomes were kept at 4oC until further use. The composition of and the nomenclature for the different virosome preparations used in the following are described in supplementary Table 1. 2.5 Characterization of MPLA incorporation To evaluate the incorporation of MPLA into the virosomes, the mouse macrophage reporter cell line RAW-BlueTM was with flu vaccine 97 (105/well) in a 96-well plate overnight at 37oC in a 5% CO 2 incubator. QUANTI-Blue (Invivogen, USA) was added to 40 \u00b5l of the supernatant. After 10 min incubation at room temperature, the absorbance at 650 nm was measured in an ELISA reader. Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma-Aldrich Chemie (CpG ODN; Eurogentec, Maastricht, The Netherlands) were used as positive controls. 2.6 Conjugation of his-tagged protein to modified virosomes Plain virosomes without (V Ni-) and with (100-800 \u00b5g) at room temperature for 30 minutes with rotation. The conjugation of his-tagged EGFP with virosomes was analyzed by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation on a 10-30-50% sucrose gradient. The gradient was centrifuged in a TLS55 rotor at 35000 rpm for 90 minutes. Subsequently, fractions of the gradient were analyzed for protein and fluorescence by ELISA reader (BioTech, USA). The fractions containing virosomes with attached his-tagged EGFP were collected and the sucrose was removed as before. The purified virosomes with attached his-tagged EGFP (V Ni+-EGFP, M/V Ni+-EGFP in in the following) were quantified by micro-Lowry and kept at 4oC until use. The binding of his-tagged NP to modified virosomes (100 \u00b5g virosomal protein + 100-400 \u00b5g NP) was performed as above. The purified virosomes with attached his-tagged NP (V Ni+-NP, M/V Ni+-NP in the following) and the mixture of virosomes with unattached his-tagged NP (V Ni- + NP, V Ni-/M + NP in the following) were quantified by micro-Lowry and kept at 4oC until use. 2.7 Uptake of free and virosome-conjugated EGFP by APCs RAW-BlueTM cells were used to determine the uptake of his-tagged proteins as follows. V Ni+- EGFP was prepared by incubating his-tagged EGFP (0 \u00b5g, \u00b5g, 2.5 \u00b5g or 5 V (1 as Free his-tagged ((0 \u00b5g, \u00b5g, 2.5 \u00b5g or V were then incubated with RAW-BlueTM cells (5x105/tube) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Cells were washed with FACS buffer (PBS with 2% FBS) 3 times and analyzed on a FACS CaliburTM BD II flow cytometer. Data was analyzed by Kaluza\u00ae Flow Cytometry Analysis Software. 2.8 Vaccination 4 96 A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1, Biologicals (Weesp, the Netherlands). A/HongKong/2/1968 (H3N2, HK68 in the following) virus for mouse challenge was kindly provided by Guus F. Rimmelzwaan (Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). by incubation with 0.1% - propiolactone (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Geel, Belgium) in citrate buffer (125 mM sodiumcitrate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 8.2) at 4\u00b0C with rotation. RAW-BlueTM cells were purchased from InvivoGen (InvivoGen, USA) and maintained according to the manufacturer`s protocol. 2.4 Preparation of modified influenza virosomes Influenza virosomes were prepared from inactivated NC99 influenza virus according to the protocol published before with some modification[23,24]. Briefly, DOGS-NTA-Ni or DOGS- NTA, dissolved in chloroform, were mixed with MPLA, dissolved in ethanol, at a ratio of 100 nmol DOGS:100 \u00b5g MPLA. The solvents were dried under a stream of nitrogen and the lipid film was further dried under vacuum in a SpeedVac centrifuge for 3 h. Meanwhile, inactivated influenza virus was disrupted with 0.1 mM DCPC in HBS and the nucleocapsid was removed by ultracentrifugation. The supernatant containing the viral surface proteins and membrane lipids (1 \u00b5mol phospholipids) was collected and was incubated with the dried film of lipid (containing MPLA and DOGS lipids) at room temperature for half an hour on ice. Tubes were inverted every 5 min to dissolve the lipid mixtures. Modified virosomes were reconstituted by removal of DCPC by dialysis against HBS buffer overnight with Slide-A-Lyzer Mini Dialysis Devices (10K MWCO) (Thermo Fisher, Germany). The buffer was changed on the second day for another 4 hours of dialysis. Non-incorporated material was removed from the virosomes on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (10-30-50%, w/v). Subsequently, the sucrose in the virosomes was removed by dialysis against HBS. The concentration of virosomal proteins was determined by micro-Lowry. These modified virosomes were kept at 4oC until further use.

Cells were washed with FACS buffer (PBS with 2% FBS) 3 times and analyzed on a FACS CaliburTM BD II flow cytometer. Data was analyzed by Kaluza\u00ae Flow Cytometry Analysis Software. 2.8 Vaccination 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 97 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 4 98 Animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines provided by the Dutch Animal Protection Act and the protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee (DEC) of the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG). Six to eight weeks old female C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice (Envigo, The Netherlands) were separated into 5 groups of 12 mice. Mice were intramuscularly immunized with 25 \u00b5l vaccine in each hind leg on day 0 and day 21 under isoflurane anesthesia. Vaccines included \u00b5g virosomal protein with 10 \u00b5g his-NP) or free NP protein alone (10 \u00b5g his-NP). PBS served as negative control. On day 28, mice were challenged by intranasal administration of 103 TCID 50 of HK68 virus in 40 \u00b5l of HBS under isoflurane anesthesia. On day 31, 6 mice in each group were sacrificed and serum samples, lung tissues, and spleen tissues were collected for further experiments. The remaining mice were monitored daily for 14 days to assess disease symptoms and potential recovery. 2.9 Elispot assays Influenza NP-specific IFN- producing cells in spleen were determined using an Elispot kit (eBioscience, the Netherlands) according to the manufacturer`s protocol. Briefly, 96 well Multiscreen PVDF filter plates (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts) were activated with 50 \u00b5l of 70% ethanol for 2 min and then washed three times with PBS. Anti-mouse IFN- capture antibodies were added to the plates and incubated at 4oC overnight. On the next day, the plates were washed three times and blocked with DMEM medium with 10% FBS for 2 hours at room temperature. Subsequently, splenocytes were added (5 x 105/well) with or without 5 \u00b5g/ml of NP peptide (ASNENMDAM; a H2-Db-restricted epitope of NP H3N2 virus) and then incubated at 37oC in IMDM complete medium overnight. After overnight incubation, plates were washed 5 times and IFN- producing cells were detected by using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-mouse IFN- antibodies. Spots were detected by using an ACE staining kit (Sigma, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and counted by AID Elispot reader (Autoimmune Diagnostika GmbH, Strassberg, Germany). The number of antigen-specific IFN- producing cells was calculated by subtracting the number of spots detected in the unstimulated samples from the number in stimulated samples. 2.10 Virus titration in lung tissue Lung tissue collected at day 3 post challenge was homogenized in 1 ml of PBS and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 minutes. Supernatants were collected, aliquoted and stored at -80oC until MPLA-adjuvanted virosomes as cross-protective flu vaccine 99 use. Lung virus titers were determined by infection of MDCK cells in 96-well plates with serial dilutions of the lung supernatants as described before[25]. 2.11 ELISA and microneutralization assay Serum antibodies against the surface proteins of HK68 virus and antibody against NP protein were detected by ELISA as previously published [24]. Briefly, 0.3 \u00b5g of HK68 subunit vaccine prepared as before or 0.3 \u00b5g of his-tagged NP protein was coated on 96-well plates overnight in 100 \u00b5l of coating buffer (0.05 M carbonate bicarbonate, pH 9.6-9.8). Then, plates were blocked with 200 \u00b5l of 2.5% milk powder solution in coating buffer for 45 min at 37\u00b0C. A series of two-fold diluted serum samples was then added to the plate and incubated for 1.5 h for 37 oC. Subsequently, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody and incubated for 1 h at 37oC. O-phenylene-diamine(OPD) was used as a substrate to react with HRP. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u00b5l of 2 M H 2SO 4. The plates were then read at 492 nm. IgG titers were calculated as the log value of the reciprocal of the dilution of serum sample corresponding to an OD492nm to 0.2. Microneutralization (MN) assay was performed as described previously[25]. 2.12 Statistics Differences between read-outs of two different vaccination groups were analyzed using Mann- Whitney U test. Survival difference was determined by log-rank test. P< 0.05 was considered as significantly different. 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 98 09-10-18 09:124Chapter 4 98 Animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines provided by the Dutch Animal Protection Act and the protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee (DEC) of the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG).

Results 3.1 Incorporation of MPLA enhances the APC-activating capacity of modified virosomes MPLA has been tested as adjuvant because it can activate APCs through engagement with TLR4 expressed on the cell surface. We first determined whether the modified influenza virosomal vaccines can activate APCs utilizing the RAW-BlueTM cell line which stably expresses all TLRs (except TLR5) and contains a were cultured with either influenza virosomes only (V), virosomes with incorporated MPLA (M/V), DOGs-NTA-Ni (V Ni+), or the TLR agonists CpG and LPS. As shown in Fig 1, the TLR ligands LPS and CpG, activated the NF- b signaling pathway resulting in the production of SEAP. M/V also strongly activated the RAW-BlueTM cells. In contrast, virosomes without MPLA (V, V Ni+) failed to activate NF- b signaling. These results demonstrate that MPLA was successfully incorporated into virosomes enabling the virosomes to activate APCs in vitro . Moreover, V Ni+ did not activate RAW-BlueTM cells indicating that presence of DOGs lipids alone is insufficient for activation of APCs. Figure. 1 Bioactivity of modified virosomes in vitro RAW-Blue cells were co-cultured with the indicated virosome preparations or with TLR ligands. After overnight incubation, SEAP activity in the supernatant was detected by QANTI-Blue. Representative of two independent experiments. Data represents mean O.D. values \u00b1 SEM. ***p<0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test. 3.2 His -tagged protein is conjugated to modified virosomes To assess the conjugation of his-tagged protein to modified virosomes we incubated his-tagged EGFP with different types of modified virosomes. The presence of the histidine residues MPLA-adjuvanted virosomes as cross-protective flu vaccine 101 provides a tag that can bind with Ni+ chelating lipid. After mixing his-tagged EGFP with Ni+ of to these modified virosomes was determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. When incubating his-tagged EGFP with virosomes Ni (V Ni-), the fluorescence of his- tagged EGFP was mainly detected in the top fraction while virosomal protein was mainly detected in the middle fraction of the gradient (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, virosomal and fluorescent protein migrated to the same fractions of the gradient when his-tagged EGFP was incubated with V Ni+ (Fig. 2 B). This indicates that the presence of Ni+ is crucial for the conjugation of his- tagged protein to virosomes. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2 C, after incubating his-tagged EGFP with M/V Ni+, protein and fluorescence signal also migrated together to the same fractions of the gradient, which demonstrates that incorporation of MPLA into virosome did not interfere with the conjugation of his-tagged protein to membrane-incorporated DOGS-NTA-Ni. To determine the binding capacity of M/V Ni+ for his-tagged protein, a fixed amount of M/V virosomes was incubated with different amounts of his-tagged EGFP as indicated in Material & Methods. The conjugation of his-tagged protein to the virosomes was then analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Protein and fluorescent signals from different fractions of the sucrose gradient showed that all the his-tagged EGFP co-migrated with the virosomal protein to the same fraction of the sucrose gradient when the ratio of virosomal protein to his- tagged EGFP was 1:2 or 1:4 (Fig 2 D and E). In contrast, a strong fluorescent signal was found in the top fractions of the gradient when the ratio of virosomal protein : EGFP was 1:8, indicating that only part of the his-tagged EGFP was conjugated to M/V Ni+ under those conditions (Fig 2 F). M/V Ni+ showed similar conjugation capacity for his-tagged NP protein. At virosomal protein: NP ratios of 1:2 and 1:3 all NP was bound to the virosomes but at a ratio of 1:5 NP started to appear in the top fraction of the gradient (supplementary Figure S2). Taken together, M/V Ni+ showed high conjugation efficacy for his-tagged proteins. 3.3 Modified virosomes facilitate the uptake of conjugated his-tagged protein by APCs We hypothesized that conjugation of a protein to influenza virosomes will facilitate its uptake by APCs. The uptake of his-tagged protein by APCs was determined by incubating M/V Ni+- EGFP or free EGFP protein with RAW-BlueTM cells and quantification of internalized EGFP by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig 3, after 1 h incubation, free EGFP was not internalized efficiently by RAW-BlueTM cells. However, EGFP conjugated to virosomes was readily taken up by RAW-BlueTM cells, as indicated by a marked increase in mean fluorescence intensity. 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 100 09-10-18 09:124Chapter 4 100 3.

Subsequently, free his-tagged EGFP protein was separated from conjugated Ni+ (100 E: 400 \u00b5g, F: 800 \u00b5g) of his-tagged EGFP room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, free his-tagged EGFP protein was separated from conjugated EGFP on a sucrose gradient by ultracentrifugation. The absorbance at 280 nm and the fluorescence of each fraction were determined by ELISA reader as described in Material & Methods. The solid line represents the absorbance of protein in each fraction at 280 nm while the dashed line represents the fluorescence of his-tagged EGFP. Data representative of three independent experiments. Moreover, higher amounts of the M/V Ni+-EGFP resulted in more uptake by APCs. These results indicate that conjugation of his-tagged protein to virosomes enhances antigen uptake by APCs. MPLA-adjuvanted virosomes as cross-protective flu vaccine 103 Figure. 3 Uptake of free EGFP or conjugated EGFP by APCs in vitro RAW-BlueTM cells were incubated with various amounts of free EGFP (A) or modified virosome (M/V Ni+) with conjugated EGFP (B) at 37oC for 1 hour and then the uptake of EGFP was analyzed by flow cytometry. 3.4 Virosomes with associated NP induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NP-specific antibodies We next evaluated the immunogenic properties of the modified virosomes in vivo . We hypothesized that attachment of NP and incorporation of MPLA into virosome would facilitate the cross-presentation of NP thereby allowing induction of NP-specific CTLs which could aid in protection from virus challenge. Moreover, immunization with modified virosomes with NP was expected to induce NP-specific antibodies. Modified virosomes were prepared from NC99 (H1N1) while NP protein was derived from HK68 (H3N2). C57BL/6 mice were primed and boosted with either M/V Ni- + NP, M/V Ni+-NP, free NP mixed with MPLA or M/V on day 0 and day 21. Control animals received PBS. To identify NP-specific IFN- producing cells against HK68 NP, the NP 366-374 epitope (ASNENMDAM) present in HK68 NP but absent from NC99 virus was used to stimulate mouse splenocytes. As indicated in Fig 4 A, only M/V Ni+-NP induced significant numbers of NP-specific IFN- producing T cells while the number of NP-specific CTLs found after immunization with M/V Ni- + NP, M/V Ni+ or free NP protein mixed with MPLA was not significantly different from the number observed in PBS control mice. To detect NP-specific antibody responses, mouse serum samples taken 3 days post challenge were analyzed by ELISA. As shown in Fig 4 B, NP-specific antibody titers in each of the NP- vaccinated groups (M/V Ni- + NP, M/V Ni+-NP were significantly higher than 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 102 09-10-18 09:124Chapter 4 102 Figure. 2 Conjugation ability and binding capacity of modified virosomes for his-tagged EGFP A-C: Modified virosomes (100 V Ni+ (B), and M/V Ni+ (C), were mixed with his- tagged EGFP (100 \u00b5g) at room temperature for 30 min.

As indicated in Fig 4 A, only M/V Ni+-NP induced significant numbers of NP-specific IFN- producing T cells while the number of NP-specific CTLs found after immunization with M/V Ni- + NP, M/V Ni+ or free NP protein mixed with MPLA was not significantly different from the number observed in PBS control mice. To detect NP-specific antibody responses, mouse serum samples taken 3 days post challenge were analyzed by ELISA. As shown in Fig 4 B, NP-specific antibody titers in each of the NP- vaccinated groups (M/V Ni- + NP, M/V Ni+-NP were significantly higher than 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 103 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 4 104 in the PBS control group. Moreover, M/V Ni- + NP and M/V Ni+-NP vaccination induced higher levels of NP-specific antibodies compared to vaccination with MPLA-adjuvanted free NP. Figure. 4 Immunogenicity of modified virosome in vivo . C57BL/6 mice were immunized either with the mixture of free NP with virosome mixture of NP with MPLA, or PBS on day 0 and day 21. On day 28, mice were challenged intranasally with 103 TCID 50 of HK68. On 3 days post challenge (day 31), NP-specific CD8 T cell immunity in splenocytes was determined ex vivo by ELISPOT (A). NP- specific IgG in serum was analyzed by ELISA (B). Data represents mean \u00b1 SEM (n=4). * p<0.05, ** p<0.005. NS, not significant. 3.5 Virosomal vaccines induce cross-protective immunity against virus infection Next, the protective potential of the modified virosome vaccines against heterosubtypic virus infection was determined. Mice were vaccinated twice as described above with modified NC99 (H1N1)-derived virosomes with admixed or attached HK68 NP, with HK68 NP + MPLA or with plain virosomes and were subsequently challenged with a lethal dose of HK68 (H3N2) virus. After virus challenge, five out of six mice in the PBS control group developed severe symptoms and lost more than 20% weight (humane endpoint) necessitating euthanasia on day 7 or 8 post infection (Fig. 5 A, B). Mice that were immunized with the mixture of NP protein and MPLA showed more rapid weight loss than mice in the PBS control group, but three mice in this group started to recover from day 5 post infection onwards. In the M/V Ni- + NP vaccinated group, four out of six mice showed rapid weight loss as observed in the NP + MPLA group. However, these mice started to recover from day 7 post infection and none of the mice needed to be sacrificed. MPLA-adjuvanted virosomes as cross-protective flu vaccine 105 In the M/V Ni+-NP vaccinated group, one out of six mice had to be sacrificed on day 5 post infection. The other five mice started to recover by day 6 or day 7 post infection after a period of moderate weight loss. Surprisingly, in the M/V vaccinated group, mice only showed mild weight loss (around 10%) and all mice recovered quickly. Determination of virus in lung tissue on day 3 post-infection revealed almost identical mean virus titers of about 10log 4.5 for all experimental groups (Supplementary Fig.3). Thus, infection and initial virus growth were not affected by any of the vaccines. To explore the possible mechanisms responsible for cross-protection, sera collected on day 3 post infection from vaccinated mice were evaluated for antibodies recognizing HK68 virus. As shown in Fig.6 A, MPLA-adjuvanted virosomes derived from NC99 virus readily induced IgG cross-reactive with HK68 surface proteins (HA + NA) in an ELISA assay. However, these antibodies were unable to neutralize HK68 virus particles (Fig. 6 B). Figure. 5 Weight loss and survival rate after heterosubtypic challenge Mice (n=6) were vaccinated and challenged as described in Fig 4. After challenge, mice were monitored daily for weight loss (A) and survival rate (B). Loss of more than 20% of original weight was considered as humane endpoint. Differences in survival were analyzed by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Taken together, these results indicate that virosomes with conjugated NP could elicit the production of NP-specific CTLs and NP-specific antibodies. However, NP-specific immunity was not required for protection from severe disease symptoms upon challenge and might even have resulted in immunopathology. Thus, immunization with (NP) virosomes protected mice against infection with heterosubtypic HK68 virus by a so far non-identified mechanism. 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 104 09-10-18 09:124Chapter 4 104 in the PBS control group.

MPLA-adjuvanted virosomes as cross-protective flu vaccine 107 4. Discussion In this study, we developed a novel virosomal influenza vaccine, aiming to enhance the generation of influenza-specific CD8 T cell responses against the NP antigen. To this end, MPLA and DOGs-NTA-Ni lipid were incorporated into the lipid bilayers of influenza virosomes. In vitro , M/V strongly activated exhibited high conjugation ability to his-tagged EGFP or NP protein and significantly enhanced the uptake of his-tagged protein by APCs. Furthermore, while virosomes with admixed or conjugated NP induced equal levels of NP-specific antibodies, only virosomes with conjugated NP mounted an NP-specific CD8 T cell response. Yet, upon live virus challenge NP-specific immunity was not required for protection since MPLA-adjuvanted virosomes without NP provided the best protection. Activation of APCs is a prerequisite for efficient induction of CTLs by cross-presentation. We found that virosomes with incorporated MPLA exhibited a stronger ability to activate RAW- BlueTM cells than plain virosomes. Incorporation of MPLA into membranous delivery systems has been described before. A study reported that incorporation of MPLA into virosomes derived from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) strongly enhanced the ability of the virosomes to activate mouse APCs[19]. Another study reported that incorporation of MPLA into glycoliposomes not only induces DC maturation, but also enhances cross-presentation of liposome-conjugated tumor antigen to CD8 T cells[26]. Activation of APCs by membrane- incorporated MPLA induces the expression of co-stimulatory molecules on the cell surface and increases cytokine release[19,26,27] thereby enabling efficient generation of CD8 T cell immunity. Next to proper activation of APCs, an important prerequisite for the induction of CTLs by non- living vaccines is the delivery of sufficient antigen to the cells. Antigen delivery depends on adequate loading of antigen in or on the delivery device and efficient uptake of the loaded delivery device by APCs. We show that incorporation of DOGS-NTA-Ni into influenza virosomes significantly enhanced the conjugation of his-tagged EGFP or NP to virosomes (Fig 2). DOGS-NTA-Ni was earlier shown to significantly increase the association of therapeutically active his-tagged peptides to liposomes without influencing the biological function of these peptides[18]. Another study reported by Masek et al demonstrates that DOGS- NTA-Ni facilitates the attachment of his-tagged heat shock protein from Candida albicans (hsp90-CA) onto liposome[28]. We used DOGS-NTA-Ni lipid for the first time with virosomes which have a membrane that is densely covered with viral surface proteins. Nevertheless, 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 106 09-10-18 09:124Chapter 4 106 Figure. 6 Cross-reactive activity of vaccination induced antibody against HK68 virus Mice (n=6) were vaccinated and challenged as described in Fig 4.

DOGS-NTA-Ni was earlier shown to significantly increase the association of therapeutically active his-tagged peptides to liposomes without influencing the biological function of these peptides[18]. Another study reported by Masek et al demonstrates that DOGS- NTA-Ni facilitates the attachment of his-tagged heat shock protein from Candida albicans (hsp90-CA) onto liposome[28]. We used DOGS-NTA-Ni lipid for the first time with virosomes which have a membrane that is densely covered with viral surface proteins. Nevertheless, 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 107 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 4 108 presence of DOGS-NTA-Ni allowed the conjugation of large amounts of protein to the virosomes indicating that the presence of the viral surface proteins did not sterically hinder binding of his-tagged protein. Originally, passive encapsulation was used to generate protein- or peptide-carrying influenza virosomes[16,17]. However, only approximately 225 ovalbumin (OVA) molecules could be encapsulated per virosomal particle using this technique[16]. In contrast, we estimate that one particle of DOGS-NTA-Ni-containing virosomes could conjugate with about 27500 4 \u00b5g EGFP/ \u00b5g virosomal protein) or to 3 \u00b5g NP/ \u00b5g virosomal protein). Thus, the incorporation of DOGS- NTA-Ni facilitated binding of approximately 50 times more NP protein than could have been achieved by passive encapsulation. Interaction of antigen and delivery system is important for the uptake of antigen by APCs and induction of antigen-specific CTLs. We demonstrate that the of his-tagged EGFP to the membrane of M/V Ni+ significantly enhanced the uptake of the protein by APCs. Our results are in line with those reported by Soema et al who show that encapsulation of M1 peptide in virosomes strongly increased the uptake of the peptide by DCs in vitro [17]. Another study demonstrates that loading melanoma tumor antigen gp100 peptide to MPLA-incorporating glycoliposomes to CD8 T cells[26]. In vivo experiments confirmed our concept that modified virosomes combining activation of APCs with efficient antigen delivery have the potential to effectively activate CD8 T cells. Indeed, we observed that M/V Ni+-NP induced NP-specific CD8 T cells while free NP with MPLA or M/V Ni- + NP did not or to a much lower extent. In contrast, induction of NP-specific antibodies was independent of conjugation of NP to virosomes. Different vaccination strategies have been developed to generate influenza-specific CD8 T cells. These strategies include DNA vaccine, viral vector vaccine, peptide vaccine and others [for review see[29] ]. Conserved T cell epitopes present in peptide vaccines or expressed by DNA vaccines or viral vector vaccines could induce influenza-specific CD8 T cells in vivo. Yet, so far the number of CD8 T cells that could be induced by these vaccines in humans was very moderate (reviewed in [30]). Accordingly, in some cases, eg the MVA-NP+M1 vaccine and the peptide vaccine Multimeric-001, the vaccine is not used alone but rather as in combination with or as priming for immunization with conventional inactivated influenza vaccine (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT03300362)[31]. Compared with these vaccination strategies, M/V Ni+-NP, consisting of virosomes which present the viral surface MPLA-adjuvanted virosomes as cross-protective flu vaccine 109 proteins and harbor conserved NP, have the potential to induce not only influenza-specific CD8 T cells but also cross-reactive antibodies. In line with others working on CD8 T cell inducing influenza vaccines we hypothesized that CTL induction by virosomes would result in mitigation of disease symptoms upon infection by allowing rapid virus clearance. M/V Ni+-NP immunization indeed provided a certain level of cross-protective immune response against heterosubtypic (HK68) virus infection. Yet, a similar level of cross-protection was achieved with M/V Ni- + NP which did not induce significant NP- specific CD8 T cells. This result implies that NP-specific CD8 T cells were not crucial for cross- protective immunity afforded by the virosomes. Moreover, immunization with M/V in the absence of NP provided the best cross-protection against heterosubtypic virus infection, suggesting that antibodies or T helper cells recognizing HA or NA were responsible for the observed mitigation of disease symptoms. No neutralizing antibodies against the challenge virus were detected, but non-neutralizing antibodies against the surface proteins (HA+NA) and NP protein were present in the vaccinated animals. It is possible that these non-neutralizing antibodies provided cross-protection for example via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)[32]. It is striking that the presence of NP-specific immunity seemed to have a negative rather than a positive effect during the initial phase of the infection: mice immunized with NP/MPLA showed a more rapid decline in weight than PBS control mice and mice immunized with virosomes with admixed or conjugated NP were less well protected than mice receiving virosomes without NP. The reason for this phenomenon is not clear. We consider it unlikely that the observed immunopathology was caused by NP-specific CTLs as CTLs recognizing the immuno-dominant NP 366-374 epitope not induced by NP + MPLA and M/V Ni- + NP. It remains elusive whether NP-specific antibodies or T helper cells or both were responsible for the observed enhanced disease symptoms. In conclusion, we developed \"all-in-one\" influenza virosomes, with MPLA and DOGS-NTA- Ni incorporated in the membrane and NP protein conjugated on the surface. These \"all-in-one\" virosomes could activate APCs and enhance the uptake of NP protein by APCs in vitro and favored the generation of NP-specific CD8 T cell responses in vivo . Although NP-specific CTLs were not involved in heterosubtypic cross-protection in this study, our results provide a basis for the use of MPLA-adjuvanted influenza virosomes containing DOGS-NTA-Ni lipid as platform for a universal influenza vaccine. 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 108 09-10-18 09:124Chapter 4 108 presence of DOGS-NTA-Ni allowed the conjugation of large amounts of protein to the virosomes indicating that the presence of the viral surface proteins did not sterically hinder binding of his-tagged protein.

However, recent studies show that SPF mice may have an immature immune system compared with wild mice or mice infected with specific pathogens. The immature immune system may affect the antibody response after vaccination. In this study, we determined whether infection of SPF mice with a specific pathogen, here Streptococcus pneumoniae , prior to immunization could affect the immune response induced by a whole- inactivated influenza virus (WIV) vaccine. Infection of SPF mice with up to 105 CFU of S. pneumoniae did not cause any clinical symptoms or weight loss but did reliably induce antibody responses. One week after immunization with WIV, influenza-specific IgG antibodies were significantly lower in S. pneumoniae pre-infected mice compared with PBS-treated mice, but this difference was gone at two weeks post immunization. Moreover, with respect to IgG subtype profile of the antibody response, we found slightly increased IgG1 levels but significantly decreased IgG2a levels in S. pneumoniae pre-infected mice compared to PBS mock-infected mice. These results indicate that previous infections can have profound effects on vaccine-induced immune responses. SPF mice are thus not a good model to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines in a natural situation. One (or multiple) infection(s) of SPF mice with common pathogens prior to immunization may provide a better model for vaccine evaluation. Key words : vaccination, whole-inactivated influenza virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae , antibody immune response S.pneumoniae infection affects flu vaccination 117 Introduction During vaccine development, preclinical studies have to be performed to select the most promising vaccine candidate to be tested in clinical trials. These studies have traditionally been performed in mice. There are several reasons why mice are a good animal model to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccine candidates. First, mice can be produced in short time, are cheap in price and of housing and are easy to handle. Second, reagents are available for detailed investigation of the immune response in mice after vaccination [1]. Third, selection of different mouse strains allows the evaluation of different types of vaccine-induced immunity. For example, BALB/c mice are prone to develop a Th2-type immune response with high antibody titers while C57BL/6 are more prone to develop Th1-type immune responses with strong cellular immunity[2]. Besides that, genetically modified mice, such as knockout mice and transgenic mice, are also available to elucidate mechanisms of protection[3,4]. Although some promising vaccine candidates have been identified by using mouse models, the direct translation of the findings in mice to humans has been questioned. One of the most important reasons may be that mice used for vaccine evaluation are normally specific pathogen- free (SPF). However, some recent publications suggest that SPF mice may have an immature immune system, compared with wild mice or those infected with specific pathogens[5-7]. It was shown that an immature immune system was associated with significantly impaired effectiveness of yellow fever vaccine[5]. The aim of this study was to determine whether bacterial infection, such as by S. pneumoniae, prior to immunization could influence the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in SPF mice. To this end, we infected mice first with S. pneumoniae via the intranasal route and four weeks later we vaccinated the mice with influenza WIV by the intramuscular route. S. pneumoniae infection as such had no effects on the well-being and weight of mice. However, S. pneumoniae infection delayed the antibody response after vaccination with WIV and changed the antibody response from an IgG2a-dominated to an IgG1-dominated phenotype. These results imply that prior infections can profoundly change the immune response to vaccination. 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 116 09-10-18 09:125Chapter 5 116 Abstract Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice are used to evaluate the effectiveness of a new vaccine before it comes to the market.

Animals were maintained on standard feed and autoclaved water in a specific pathogen free (SPF) facility of Shantou University Medical College. For bacterial infection and influenza vaccination study, mice were kept in microisolator cages, which were equipped with HEPA filter under ABSL2 conditions. All procedures were performed according to the guidelines approved by institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All studies were approved by the ethical committee of Shantou University Medical College, China. Bacteria and influenza vaccine Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotype 19F, ATCC 49619) was purchased from Guangdong culture collection center, Guangzhou, China. The purchased bacteria were stored at 80\u00b0C in skim milk media. For recovery, bacterial from frozen stock were cultured by two successive passages on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Colonies from the second passage were cultured in trypticase soy broth under 5% CO 2 at 37\u00b0C overnight. Finally, 2 mL of the bacterial suspension was grown in 8 mL of trypticase soy broth and incubated for 4 to 5 h (reaching to early-log phase) until O.D 600 of 0.8. After that, the bacteria were collected and stored at -80oC for infection of mice. Bacterial titers (CFU/ml) were determined by inoculating 10-fold serial dilutions of bacteria on blood agar plates. Whole inactivated influenza vaccine (WIV) derived from A/PR/8/1934 (PR8 in the following) was kindly provided by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), Potters Bar, UK. Bacterial infection and WIV immunization Mice were anesthetized with 400mg/kg of Avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol, sigma) by i.p. injection as before[8]. Different doses S. pneumoniae (103,104 or 105 CFU) were inoculated intranasally in 50 \u00b5l PBS. Weight loss, morbidity and mortality of mice were recorded daily for two weeks and mice were to be sacrificed when they had lost 20% in total or 10% in one day of their original body weight. After 30 days post-infection, mice were immunized intramuscularly with 25 \u00b5l of PR8 WIV (corresponding to 2.5 \u00b5g of total protein) vaccine in each hind leg (5 \u00b5g of WIV per mouse in total). Serum samples were collected on day 0 (before WIV immunization), 7, 14 and 21 post-immunization by cheek puncture under anesthesia. S.pneumoniae infection affects flu vaccination 119 ELISA For detection of IgG antibody against S. pneumoniae in serum samples, ELISA plates (Nunc Maxisorp, USA) were coated with 200 \u00b5l diluted whole S. pneumonia cells (equal to OD 600 of 0.05) in coating buffer (0.05M carbonate bicarbonate, pH 9.6-9.8) overnight at 37oC. Then, plates were blocked with 200 l of 2.5% milk powder solution in coating buffer for 45 min at 37oC. Two-fold diluted serum samples were then added to the plate and incubated for 1.5 h at 37oC. Subsequently, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody for 1 h at 37oC. O-phenylene-diamine (OPD) was used as a substrate to react with HRP. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 l of 2M H 2SO 4. The plates were then read at 492 nm. For detection of IgM, IgG, IgG1 or IgG2a antibody against PR8 virus in serum samples, ELISA plates (Nunc Maxisorp, USA) were coated with 0.3 \u00b5g/ well of PR8 WIV overnight at 37 oC.

Three groups of BALB/c mice were infected with different dose (103, 104 or 105 CFU) of S. pneumoniae, respectively. PBS mock-infected mice served as negative control. During two weeks after infection, mice were observed daily for clinical symptoms and weight change. None of the infected mice showed weight loss, not even the mice which were infected with 105 CFU of S. pneumoniae (Fig.1) . Also, no other clinical symptoms were observed in these mice. Figure 1. Streptococcus pneumoniae infection did not cause weight loss of mice. Different doses (103, 104, 105 CFU/mouse) of S. pneumoniae were inoculated (n=5). PBS mock-infected mice (n=5) served as negative control. After infection, mice were monitored daily for weight loss. On day 30 post-infection, serum samples were collected from the infected mice. Serum antibody titers against S. pneumoniae were determined by ELISA. As shown in Fig 2, antibodies against S. pneumoniae were found in all three groups of bacteria-infected mice while no antibodies were found in mock-infected mice. Moreover, the antibody titer against S. pneumoniae was positively correlated with bacterial inoculation titer. These results indicate that the selected S. pneumoniae strain, serotype 19F, can infect mice but that the infection proceeds asymptomatically for an inoculum of up to 105 CFU.

Total anti-PR8 IgM and IgG was determined in serum on day 0, 7 and 14 post-vaccination. S. pneumoniae -infected and control mice exhibited equivalent IgM antibody responses at all time points after vaccination (Figure 3A). In contrast, anti-PR8 IgG antibody titers were lower in the mice that infected by 104 or 105 CFU of S. pneumoniae than in PBS-treated mice on day 7 post vaccination (Figure 3B). However, on day 14 post vaccination the levels of anti-PR8 IgG antibody were similar for S. pneumoniae -infected mice and PBS-treated mice (Figure 3B). With respect to the subtype profile of the IgG antibodies, we found significantly increased anti- PR8 IgG1 antibody titers in mice pre-infected with 104 or 105 CFU of S. pneumoniae -infected mice compared to PBS-treated mice and mice infected with 103 CFU (Figure 4A). However, 5 out of 6 mice in the groups that infected with 104 or 105 of S. pneumoniae had no IgG2a at all whereas the IgG2a titers in the PBS group and the group infected with 103 were high (Figure 4B). These results demonstrate that infection with S. pneumoniae not only reduced the generation of influenza-specific IgG antibodies, but also skewed the antibody responses to a Th2 phenotype. S.pneumoniae infection affects flu vaccination 123 Discussion In this study, we determined whether S.pneumoniae infection of SPF mice could influence the effectiveness of influenza vaccine. To this end, we infected mice with S. pneumoniae intranasally first and 4 weeks later vaccinated those mice with PR8 WIV. We found that even 105 CFU/mouse of S. pneumoniae did not cause symptomatic infection in mice. However, we detected anti- S. pneumoniae antibody in the serum of all infected mice, which indicates that the infection as such was successful. Moreover, we found that infection with S. pneumoniae delayed the IgG antibody response to a subsequent vaccination against influenza and skewed the response to a Th2-like phenotype. The absence of clinical symptoms in mice infected with S. pneumoniae (ATCC 49619, serotype 19 F) has been described before. Previous publications showed that clinical strains belonging to serotypes 9, 14, 19 and 23, are avirulent in mice[10,11]. A study by Zuluaga et al also showed that all mice survived an infection with S. pneumoniae serotype 19F, with only some bacterial growth in the lungs[12]. These studies suggested that this serotype can cause infection in mice, but these are mild or asymptomatic. Our findings are in line with these findings: we detected antibodies against S. pneumoniae in the serum sample of all infected mice; yet, no weight loss or other signs of disease were detected, indicating that S. pneumoniae caused asymptomatic infections in this study. We found that infection with S. pneumoniae prior to immunization with WIV delayed the vaccine-evoked IgG antibody response, indicated by significantly lower IgG titers in prior infected than in mock-infected mice on day 7 post-immunization but equal titers on day 14. An effect of prior infection on immune responses to vaccination are also reported in a recent publication by Reese et al which shows that co-infection of laboratory mice with viruses, such as herpesviruses, influenza, and a helminth resulted in reduced antibody responses after vaccination with yellow fever virus vaccine[5]. Another study by Beura et al reported that pathogen exposure could alter the composition of the innate and adaptive immune systems of laboratory mice[6]. Together with these studies, we speculate that the infection history could alter the antibody immune response against unrelated antigens. This observation is important when evaluating vaccines in animal models. Interestingly, we found that prior infection with S. pneumoniae slightly increased Th2-type (IgG1) antibody titer upon WIV vaccination significantly decreased Th1-type (IgG2a) antibody titer compared to PBS-infected mice, indicating that S. pneumoniae impaired the 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 122 09-10-18 09:125Chapter 5 122 Figure 4. Prior infection of mice with Streptococcus pneumonia skewed antibody response to Th2 type after vaccination with influenza WIV Mice were infected and immunized as described in the legend to Fig. 1. WIV-specific IgG1 (A) and IgG2a (B) responses in serum samples collected on day 7 post-immunization from each group (n=3 or 4) were determined by ELISA. Next, to determine whether a prior infection with S. pneumoniae has an effect on the immune response to an influenza vaccine, S. pneumoniae -infected or PBS mock-infected mice were vaccinated with PR8 WIV.

It has been reported that Th1- type antibody (IgG2a) responses exhibit superior ability to prevent virus infection in vivo than Th2-type (IgG1) antibody response, by Fc receptor-dependent mechanisms[14]. Thus, we speculate that the reduced Th1-type antibody response in S. pneumoniae -infected mice could impair (cross-)protection against a following influenza virus infection. Potential mechanisms for how S. pneumoniae prior infection alters immunity induced by influenza WIV vaccine are not clear yet. A recent publication by Abolins et al shows that highly pathogen-exposed wild mice exhibit reduced cytokine responses to pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs) compared with laboratory mice, indicating that pathogen exposure history may impair PAMP-induced pathways[7]. A study by Geeraedts et al shows that TLR7, a pattern recognition receptor which can sense single stranded RNA, plays an important role in the magnitude and phenotype of the antibody immune response to influenza WIV vaccination[13]. Thus, we speculate that S. pneumonia infection may have inhibited the cytokine production by innate cells triggered by TLR7 stimulation resulting in reduced Th1- type antibody immune responses to WIV vaccination. A limitation of this study is that we did not investigate whether S. pneumoniae prior infection could influence WIV-induced protection against virus challenge. This issue should be clarified in future experiments. Another limitation of this study is that we do not know whether S. pneumoniae prior infection could alter the T cell immunity induced by WIV vaccination. Previous publications indicate that T cell immune responses also correlate with protection against virus infection in animal models and in humans[15,16]. In summary, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of influenza vaccine determined in SPF mice might not reflect the situation in real life since previous infection history, such as S. pneumoniae infection, can profoundly influence vaccine effectiveness. A mouse model which could directly reflect the pathogen exposure history in humans is required for better translation of findings in animals to humans.

Disease symptoms and course of the infection have been studied in detail. Cotton rats have also been used to evaluate influenza vaccines. However, information on advantages and disadvantages of using this model and on points to consider while exploiting this model for influenza vaccine evaluation is limited. Here we show with whole inactivated virus (WIV) influenza vaccine that a single intramuscular immunization with a dose of 0.5 \u00b5g was immunogenic in cotton rats. Administration of a booster dose significantly increased the humoral immune response. To evaluate protective efficacy, cotton rats were challenged with a clinical isolate of H1N1pdm virus. Non-vaccinated animals were highly susceptible for the infection, presented with high lung virus load on day one and three post challenge and half of the animals succumbed quickly without showing signs of sickness reliably predicting the rapid death. In contrast, vaccinated cotton rats had low or undetectable lung virus titers and two out of four animals of the 0.5 \u00b5g group survived the challenge. In spite of low lung virus titers and less pronounced induction of IFN upon challenge, most vaccinated animals showed increase in breathing frequency though in some cases this increase was of shorter duration than in non-vaccinated animals. Our data suggests that cotton rats are a suitable animal model for influenza infection and vaccine evaluation but careful fine tuning of the experimental parameters is required. Key words: Cotton rats, whole inactivated virus (WIV) influenza vaccine, humoral immune response, virus challenge, lung viral load, breathing frequency. Cotton rat model for flu vaccine evaluation 129 Introduction Cotton rats ( Sigmodon hispidus ) have been used as a small animal model for respiratory virus infections such as human parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles virus, human metapneumovirus and as well as for influenza virus infection and pathogenesis studies [1-7]. All these respiratory viruses can easily replicate in cotton rats and induce pathogenesis similar to that in humans. Unlike mice, cotton rats are susceptible to clinical isolates of influenza virus without prior adaptation of the virus [4,8,9]. Indeed, cotton rats have been infected successfully with a broad range of clinical influenza virus strains[4,6,10]. Upon infection, cotton rats show easily quantifiable disease symptoms like increased breathing frequency, reduced body weight and decreased body temperature[11,12]. Despite the positive results with cotton rats as a model for influenza infection, there is so far limited information on the performance of influenza vaccines in cotton rats. Early studies evaluated the effect of infection-induced immunity on subsequent challenge with homologous or heterologous virus strains [13,14]. Later the studies were extended to UV-inactivated virus, seasonal trivalent split vaccine and more recently recombinant adenovirus vaccines and AS03- adjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic influenza vaccine [11,12,15-17]. Some of these studies report on reduced increase in breathing frequency (BF) in immunized versus na\u00efve cotton rats upon challenge[13] [15]. Some studies investigated additional parameters like lung virus titers and lung pathology and/or determined induction of antibodies. However, none of the studies gives a complete description of clinical symptoms like changes in weight and temperature. Moreover, none of the studies describes evaluation of vaccines against H1N1pdm virus, a clinically highly relevant virus which is still in circulation. The aim of this study was to obtain more detailed insight in the advantages and disadvantages of cotton rats for the evaluation of influenza vaccine candidates against a clinically relevant virus. To this end, we immunized cotton rats once or twice with different doses of a whole inactivated virus (WIV) influenza vaccine derived from a H1N1pdm vaccine strain and challenged the animals with a clinical isolate of H1N1pdm. Antibody titers in immunized animals correlated with vaccine dose and were boosted by a second immunization. Upon challenge, some animals of the non-immunized control group and the low dose immunization group succumbed quickly without prior overt signs of their poor condition. In the surviving immunized animals, lung virus titers on day one post challenge were strongly reduced as compared to titers in control animals. Yet, immunization had limited effects on clinical symptoms like tachypnea and disease parameters or on induction of cytokines and Mx1 in the 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 128 09-10-18 09:126Chapter 6 128 Abstract Cotton rats have successfully been infected with clinical strains of influenza viruses without pre-adaptation of the virus like required for mice.

Cotton rat model for flu vaccine evaluation 131 Materials and Methods Vaccine and virus NIBRG-121, a vaccine strain produced from A/California/7/2009 virus, was obtained from NIBSC (Potters Bay, UK) and grown in embryonated chicken eggs. The virus was inactivated by overnight treatment with 0.1% -propiolactone (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) in citrate buffer (125 sodiumcitrate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 8.2) at 4\u00b0C to produce whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccine. Inactivation was followed by dialysis against HNE buffer (145 mM NaCl, 5 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, sterilized by autoclaving). Inactivation of the virus was verified by inoculation of MDCK cells and the amount of protein was determined by micro-Lowry assay. A clinical isolate of H1N1pdm (isolate E9-6714) was provided by the Department of Clinical Virology, UMCG. The virus was diagnosed by qPCR as being similar to A/California/7/2009 virus. This virus will be called A/Cal/Gro in the following. The virus was further amplified on MDCK cells, titrated in cotton rats and was used as challenge virus. Virus titer was determined by viruses) used for determination of cross-reactive IgG ELISA were kindly provided by NIBSC, UK. Cotton rats and immunization All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Groningen (IACUC-RuG), The Netherlands. Outbred female cotton rats at an age of 10-12 weeks were purchased from Harlan Laboratories, USA. The animals were housed in individually ventilated cages with two cotton rats per cage. All the cotton rats were injected with implantable electronic ID transponders (Bio Medic Data Systems Inc (BMDS), Delaware, USA) subcutaneously (s.c.) for individual identification and temperature measurement. The weight of the cotton rats ranged between 120 and 150 grams during the challenge phase. A sample size of 4 animals per group was based on the literature[13,19,20]. The study comprised two independent experiments the details of which are described in Table 1. Cotton rats were vaccinated via the intramuscular (i.m.) route with 100 \u00b5l vaccine distributed over the hind limbs. Four weeks after the single immunization in Experiment 1 or the 2nd immunization in Experiment 2, cotton rats were challenged with A/Cal/Gro, 5*107 TCID50 in 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 130 09-10-18 09:126Chapter 6 130 lungs.

Virus titer was determined by viruses) used for determination of cross-reactive IgG ELISA were kindly provided by NIBSC, UK. Cotton rats and immunization All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Groningen (IACUC-RuG), The Netherlands. Outbred female cotton rats at an age of 10-12 weeks were purchased from Harlan Laboratories, USA. The animals were housed in individually ventilated cages with two cotton rats per cage. All the cotton rats were injected with implantable electronic ID transponders (Bio Medic Data Systems Inc (BMDS), Delaware, USA) subcutaneously (s.c.) for individual identification and temperature measurement. The weight of the cotton rats ranged between 120 and 150 grams during the challenge phase. A sample size of 4 animals per group was based on the literature[13,19,20]. The study comprised two independent experiments the details of which are described in Table 1. Cotton rats were vaccinated via the intramuscular (i.m.) route with 100 \u00b5l vaccine distributed over the hind limbs. Four weeks after the single immunization in Experiment 1 or the 2nd immunization in Experiment 2, cotton rats were challenged with A/Cal/Gro, 5*107 TCID50 in 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 131 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 6 1 and 1*107 TCID50 in Experiment 2. Inoculation doses were chosen on basis of the literature (Blanco et al., 2013) and were tested in cotton rats prior to the immunization/challenge experiments. The virus in a volume of 100 \u00b5l was distributed over both the nostrils using a pipette. Both vaccination and challenge were carried out under 5% isoflurane/O 2 anaesthesia. The two non-treated control animals in Experiment 2 received neither vaccination nor challenge. For Experiment 1, various clinical symptoms were assessed and the animals were sacrificed three days post challenge. For Experiment 2, one day after the challenge half of the cotton rats from the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups were sacrificed for the assessment of lung virus titers and systemic immune responses. The remaining animals were followed for ten days for assessment of clinical symptoms. Assessment of clinical symptoms and sample collection After challenge, cotton rats were followed daily for determination of changes in weight, temperature and breathing frequency for three days in the 1st experiment and ten days in the 2nd experiment. Animals were weighed by catching them into a pre-weighed cardboard roll. Weight loss of 10% in one day or 15% from the day of challenge were considered as criteria for the humane endpoint. Ten days post challenge the remaining cotton rats were sacrificed. Breathing frequency (BF) was measured by plethysmography as described previously [21]. Briefly, the animal was placed in a 1,500 ml air-tight but transparent tube of a whole-body plethysmograph which was connected to a pressure transducer. The frequency of pressure changes inside the tube was recorded and displayed as breaths per minute (bpm). A mean BF of an animal was then calculated from a minimum of four steady regions lasting for at least 15 seconds. For many of the animals, if they breathed at a constant rate we even recorded breathing for a minute or more consecutively. Maximal variation between the readings was +/- 5 to 10 breathes/minute, thus about 1-3%. Temperature was measured while the animal was restrained in the cardboard container using a DAS-7008/9 detector for s.c. injected electronic ID transponders (BMDS, Seaford, USA). Blood was drawn on the day(s) of immunization, the day of challenge and the days of sacrifice. Serum was separated and stored at -20\u00b0C until assessment of IgG, neutralizing (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies. A small part of the same lung was stored in RNAlater (QIAgen, The Netherlands) for cytokine profiling by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cotton rat model for flu vaccine evaluation 133 Lung virus titration Equally sized parts of the lungs were collected in 1 ml complete EPISERF medium (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and were homogenized, centrifuged and the supernatants were used for determination of viral load in the lungs as described previously [18]. Virus amounts are represented as log 10 titer per ml of medium. Limit of detection (LoD) was calculated using the 1st dilution made; negative samples were assigned a value corresponding to half of the LoD value for calculation purposes. IgG and IgA ELISA IgG ELISA was performed by coating ELISA plates (Greiner Bio One, Alphen a/d Rijn, The of A/PR/8, or X-31 WIV in coating buffer (17.8 mM Na2CO 3, 22.5 mM NaHCO 3, pH9.6) overnight at 37\u00b0C. ELISA was done as described previously [22]. IgG titers were calculated as log 10 of the reciprocal of the sample dilution corresponding to an absorbance of 0.2 at the wavelength of 492 nm. Limit of detection (LoD) was calculated using the 1st dilution made and the negative samples were given half the value of the LoD value. Microneutralization assay (MN) and Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) Serum samples taken on the day of the 2nd immunization, the day of challenge and ten days post challenge were assessed for MN and HI antibodies against A/California/2009 virus using a previously described protocol [22,23] respectively. Titers are presented as log 2 HI titers for individual cotton rats. Limit of detection (LoD) was calculated using the 1st dilution made and the negative samples were given half the value of the LoD value.

GAPDH was used 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 133 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 6 134 as a house keeping gene. PCR cycling conditions were set as 10 min 95 \u00b0C followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec 95\u00b0C and 1 min 60\u00b0C on an Applied Biosystems' StepOnePlus real time PCR system. SYBR green ROX-mix used was from Westburg (Leusden, Netherlands). For analysis, mean CT values of GAPDH per sample was subtracted from the mean CT values of the cytokine for the same animal to calculate delta CT values. Delta delta CT values were then calculated by subtracting delta CT of the non-treated cotton rats from delta CT of the vaccinated and non-vaccinated cotton rats that were challenged and killed on day one and day ten post challenge. The fold change was then calculated. Cytokines are represented as log 2 fold change in vaccinated and non-vaccinated cotton rats with respect to non-treated cotton rat. Statistics The statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software with which the graphs were plotted as well. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to test if the differences between two groups i.e. vaccinated and non-vaccinated cotton rats, with respect to different parameters were significant. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Cotton rat model for flu vaccine evaluation 135 Results Effect of a single immunization on clinical symptoms after virus challenge. In order to assess the effect of vaccination on disease symptoms and lung virus growth, in a first experiment cotton rats were i.m. injected with a single dose of either PBS, 0.5 \u00b5g, 1 \u00b5g or 5 \u00b5g WIV followed by homologous challenge with a dose of 5x107 TCID 50 H1N1pdm 30 days later. Upon challenge clinical symptoms like weight loss, breathing frequency and temperature were assessed for three days in vaccinated and non-vaccinated cotton rats. Two animals from the PBS control group were found dead on day three post challenge. The two remaining cotton rats from the PBS group did not show considerable weight loss on day one post challenge, however their weight reduced over the next two days (Fig. 1A). Two cotton rats from the 0.5 \u00b5g WIV group were found dead on day two post challenge, the other animals from this group did not show much weight loss (Fig. 1B). Animals from the 1 \u00b5g and 5 \u00b5g WIV groups lost no or little weight (Fig. 1C and 1D respectively). The two remaining animals from the PBS control group showed a slight drop in temperature (Fig. 1E). Temperature was not affected by the virus infection in the animals from the 0.5 \u00b5g, 1 \u00b5g and 5 \u00b5g WIV groups (Fig. 1F, 1G and 1H respectively). All four cotton rats from the PBS control group presented with a significant increase in breathing frequency (BF) on day two post challenge and then BF started to normalize (Fig. 1I). Also, all the animals in the 0.5 \u00b5g WIV group showed increase in breathing frequency on day two (Figure 1J). While two of the animals in the 1 \u00b5g WIV group demonstrated a marked and sustained increase in BF post challenge, the remaining two animals presented with only moderately increased BF which returned to normal values by day three (Figure 1K). Cotton rats in the 5 \u00b5g WIV group also showed increased breathing on day 1 post challenge. However, on day two, BF in these animals started to decrease and was significantly lower than the BF in the mock-immunized control animals on day two (*p = 0.0286). For 3 of the 4 animals the BF came to the baseline on day three (Figure 1L). Hence, breathing frequency was the most sensitive parameter of infection in the used cotton rat model. In conclusion, immunization with a sufficiently high dose of WIV prevented infection-induced death of the cotton rats but provided limited protection against clinical symptoms. Some of the control animals and of the 0.5 ug WIV group died rapidly without prior overt signs of distress. 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 134 09-10-18 09:126Chapter 6 134 as a house keeping gene.

Effect of a single immunization on clinical symptoms after virus challenge. Cotton rats mock- immunized with PBS or immunized once with 1 \u00b5g WIV or 5 \u00b5g WIV and challenged on day 30 with 5*107 TCID 50 of homologous A/Cal/Gro were followed for three days and weight (A-D), temperature (E-H) and breathing frequency (I-L) were recorded. Discontinued line with X symbol indicates dead animal. Effect of a single immunization on lung virus titers. To assess the effect of the immunization on virus growth, immunized and PBS treated animals were sacrificed three days post challenge to evaluate lung virus titers. Since two animals from each the PBS treated and the 0.5 \u00b5g WIV groups were found dead before day three virus titers could not be retrieved from them. The two surviving cotton rats from the PBS group showed titers of 103.2/ml and 103.5/ml, respectively. Of the surviving animals from the 0.5 \u00b5g WIV group one had a low virus titer of 102.8/ml while the other had no detectable virus in the lung. Animals vaccinated with 1 \u00b5g or 5 \u00b5g WIV were all free of virus in the lungs three days post infection (Fig. 2). No virus was found in the nose of any of the animals. Thus, even a single vaccination resulted in restricted virus growth in the lungs upon challenge. Cotton rat model for flu vaccine evaluation 137 Fig.2. Effect of a single immunization on lung virus titers. The surviving cotton rats from the experiment described in the legend to Fig. 1 were sacrificed three days post challenge and lung virus titers were determined. Virus titers for individual cotton rats and the mean titers per experimental group are depicted. LoD for the virus titers is indicated at 0.3 with a dashed line and negative samples are assigned a value corresponding to half of the LoD. Systemic immune response after a single vaccination. To assess the systemic immune response induced by WIV, serum IgG titers were evaluated by ELISA on the day of immunization and the day of challenge. On the day of immunization all cotton rats were sero-negative for influenza (data not shown). On the day of challenge, all vaccinated cotton rats had developed antibodies with a titer of 103 or higher. Compared to IgG titers induced by 0.5 \u00b5g WIV, significantly higher IgG titers were induced by 1 and 5 \u00b5g WIV (Fig. 3). Yet, the differences were rather small (about 2.5 fold). Thus, all vaccine doses induced robust serum IgG responses upon a single vaccination. Effects of prime/boost vaccination on clinical symptoms post challenge. Since a single immunization protected from virus growth but not from clinical symptoms we next assessed whether the protection provided by WIV could be improved by giving a booster vaccination. For this purpose, in the 2nd experiment cotton rats were vaccinated twice with 1 \u00b5g NIBRG-121 WIV with a 21-day interval. 30 days after the 2nd vaccination, the cotton rats were challenged with 1x107 TCID 50 of homologous A/Cal/Gro. The lower challenge dose compared to the 1st experiment was chosen in order to slow down the disease process. Upon challenge, animals were followed daily for ten days for changes in weight, temperature and breathing frequency. 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 136 09-10-18 09:126Chapter 6 136 Fig.1.

The lower challenge dose compared to the 1st experiment was chosen in order to slow down the disease process. Upon challenge, animals were followed daily for ten days for changes in weight, temperature and breathing frequency. 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 137 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 6 138 Fig.3. Systemic immune response after a single vaccination. Serum IgG responses were evaluated 30 days after a single immunization with the indicated amounts of WIV. IgG titers are presented as log 10 titers for individual cotton rats with means per group (n=4). LoD is indicated at 2 with a dashed line and significance is represented as *p<0.05. Despite of the five-fold lower virus challenge dose, two of the four mock-vaccinated cotton rats were found dead in the cage on day three and four post challenge. The remaining two cotton rats from the control group displayed minor weight loss but survived until the end of the follow- up period (Fig.4A). Cotton rats vaccinated twice with 1 \u00b5g WIV lost some weight on day two post challenge (Fig.4B) and thereafter the weights were stable till sacrifice. Interestingly, two control cotton rats which were neither vaccinated nor challenged also lost also some weight over time (Fig.4 C) and did not regain it, which might suggest that daily handling caused a stress response affecting eating or drinking behavior. Temperature was not affected in the infected animals except for one of the mock-vaccinated cotton rats which showed a decline in temperature one day before death (Fig. 4D-F). All of the mock-vaccinated cotton rats showed a significant increase in BF between the day of challenge and day two post challenge, indicating successful infection (Fig. 4G). One of the four cotton rats reached a BF of around 460 and was found dead two days later. Cotton rats vaccinated with 1 \u00b5g WIV also presented with significantly higher BF on day two post challenge as compared to the day of challenge (Fig. 4H). There was no statistically significant difference in BF between mock-vaccinated and vaccinated animals in this experiment (p=1.0000). After day two, BF started to return to normal. Non-treated cotton rats did not show Cotton rat model for flu vaccine evaluation 139 much change in the breathing frequency compared to their baseline breathing frequency (Fig.4I). Effect of prime/boost vaccination on lung virus titers after challenge. One day post challenge, half of the animals from the vaccinated and the mock-vaccinated group were sacrificed to evaluate the viral load in the lungs. Lungs of the sacrificed cotton rats were homogenized and the supernatants were used for determination of the TCID 50 in MDCK cells. All cotton rats from the mock-vaccinated group had virus in their lungs, with a mean titer of 105.51/ml (Fig.5). In contrast, out of four immunized cotton rats, two did not show detectable virus and the remaining two showed reduced titers (101 and 103.8) as compared to the virus titers in non-vaccinated cotton rats (lowest titer: 104.4). Thus, vaccination provided significant protection (p=0.0294) from virus growth in the lungs as observed in the previous experiment. Fig.4. Effects of prime/boost vaccination on clinical symptoms post challenge. Cotton rats were injected with PBS, immunized twice with 1 \u00b5g WIV, or were left untreated. 30 days after the 2nd immunization immunized and mock-immunized animals were challenged with 1*107 TCID 50 of homologous virus, non-treated animals were again left untreated. After challenge, 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 138 09-10-18 09:126Chapter 6 138 Fig.3. Systemic immune response after a single vaccination.

IgG titers are presented as log 10 titers for individual cotton rats with means per group (n=4). LoD is indicated at 2 with a dashed line and significance is represented as *p<0.05. Despite of the five-fold lower virus challenge dose, two of the four mock-vaccinated cotton rats were found dead in the cage on day three and four post challenge.

Temperature was not affected in the infected animals except for one of the mock-vaccinated cotton rats which showed a decline in temperature one day before death (Fig. 4D-F). All of the mock-vaccinated cotton rats showed a significant increase in BF between the day of challenge and day two post challenge, indicating successful infection (Fig. 4G). One of the four cotton rats reached a BF of around 460 and was found dead two days later. Cotton rats vaccinated with 1 \u00b5g WIV also presented with significantly higher BF on day two post challenge as compared to the day of challenge (Fig. 4H). There was no statistically significant difference in BF between mock-vaccinated and vaccinated animals in this experiment (p=1.0000). After day two, BF started to return to normal. Non-treated cotton rats did not show Cotton rat model for flu vaccine evaluation 139 much change in the breathing frequency compared to their baseline breathing frequency (Fig.4I).

One day post challenge, half of the animals from the vaccinated and the mock-vaccinated group were sacrificed to evaluate the viral load in the lungs. Lungs of the sacrificed cotton rats were homogenized and the supernatants were used for determination of the TCID 50 in MDCK cells. All cotton rats from the mock-vaccinated group had virus in their lungs, with a mean titer of 105.51/ml (Fig.5). In contrast, out of four immunized cotton rats, two did not show detectable virus and the remaining two showed reduced titers (101 and 103.8) as compared to the virus titers in non-vaccinated cotton rats (lowest titer: 104.4). Thus, vaccination provided significant protection (p=0.0294) from virus growth in the lungs as observed in the previous experiment. Fig.4.

Cotton rats were injected with PBS, immunized twice with 1 \u00b5g WIV, or were left untreated. 30 days after the 2nd immunization immunized and mock-immunized animals were challenged with 1*107 TCID 50 of homologous virus, non-treated animals were again left untreated. After challenge, 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 139 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 6 140 animals were followed for weight loss (A-C), change in temperature (D-F) and breathing frequency (G-I). Discontinued line with X symbol indicates dead animals. IgG responses after prime/boost vaccination and challenge. To measure the systemic immune response induced by immunization and/or infection, IgG ELISA was performed on the serum samples taken on the days of immunization (d0, d21), day of challenge (d50) and ten days post challenge (d61) from vaccinated as well as mock- vaccinated cotton rats. Fig.5. Effect of prime/boost vaccination on lung virus titers after challenge. 30 days after the 2nd vaccination cotton rats were challenged with 107 TCID 50 homologous A/Cal/Gro by i.n. administration. One day post challenge, lung virus titers were determined by TCID 50. Virus titers of individual animals and the mean virus titer per experimental group are depicted. Lung virus titers from the vaccinated cotton rats are compared with the lung virus titers from mock vaccinated animals and significance is represented as *p<0.05. LoD for the virus titers is indicated at 0.3 with a dashed line. IgG titers were determined against homologous NIBRG-121. None of the animals showed any IgG titers in the beginning of the experiment (data not shown). Cotton rats from the 1 \u00b5g WIV group developed IgG titers of around 103.8 (Fig.6A) after the 1st immunization on day 21 which increased significantly after the 2nd vaccination. Interestingly, IgG titers further increased significantly upon challenge indicating a booster by the infection itself. For non-vaccinated cotton rats, there was no serum IgG on the day of challenge (Fig. 6B), but ten days post challenge virus-specific IgG was readily detectable in the two surviving animals confirming successful infection. Cotton rat model for flu vaccine evaluation 141 To assess the cross-reactive potential of these IgG antibodies, ELISA was performed against heterologous A/PR/8 H1N1 and heterosubtypic X-31 H3N2. All with 1 \u00b5g WIV showed IgG responses to A/PR/8 but titers were about 1 log lower than those against the homologous virus (Fig. 6C). Two of the four vaccinated cotton rats showed also IgG to X-31 (Fig. 6D). Yet, responses to this heterosubtypic virus were much lower than responses to the homologous virus or were even below the detection limit. Fig.6. IgG responses after prime/boost vaccination and challenge. Serum samples collected on day 0, after the 1st vaccination (d21), on the day of challenge (d50) and 10 days post challenge (d61) were used for determination of IgG titers. IgG ELISA was performed for sera of (A) vaccinated cotton rats and (B) non-vaccinated cotton rats. Cross reactive IgG against A/PR/8 H1N1 (C) against measured in d50 serum samples. IgG titers from the day of challenge are compared with the IgG titers on day 10 post challenge (also with day 0 for the vaccinated cotton rats).

Assessment of functional potential of systemic antibodies by HI and MN upon prime/boost vaccination. To assess the functional potential of the serum IgG, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) using homologus NIBRG-121. In line with the IgG antibody responses, HI (Fig. 7A) and MN (Fig. 7B) antibodies were induced after two vaccinations with 1 \u00b5g WIV and increased further after challenge.

For non-vaccinated cotton 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 141 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 6 142 rats, HI (Fig. 7C) and MN (Fig. 7D) antibodies were undetectable before challenge but were present 10 days post challenge although at lower levels than in vaccinated animals. Fig. 7. Assessment of the functional potential of systemic antibodies by HI and MN assays Serum samples were collected at the 2nd vaccination (d21), day of challenge (d50), and 10 days post homologous challenge (d61) and functionality of the IgG was measured by HI and MN for vaccinated (A,B) and non-vaccinated cotton rats (C,D). HI and MN antibody titers against NIBRG-121 virus are represented as log 2 titers.

LoD for the MN titers is indicated at 4.32 and LoD for the HI titers is indicated at 2.58, both indicated with a dashed line. We also checked for the cross-neutralizing potential of serum antibodies against A/PR/8 H1N1 and X-31 H3N2 virus. However, despite the presence of cross-reacting antibodies detected by ELISA these antibodies could not neutralize the heterologous and heterosubtypic viruses (results not shown). Cotton rat model for flu vaccine evaluation 143 Effect of prime/boost vaccination on infection-related expression of Mx and cytokine genes in the lung. To evaluate the effects of vaccination on expression of infection-related genes in lungs upon challenge, qRT-PCR was performed on mRNA isolated from lung tissue, mRNA derived from lungs of non-treated cotton rats was used to set the baseline expression. Mx proteins can inhibit virus replication and have been described to be strongly induced in the lungs of influenza-infected cotton rats [24,25]. Infection clearly led to increased expression of Mx1 1 day post challenge in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated cotton rats which had returned to normal or even less than normal levels by day 10 (Fig. 8 Mx1). On the contrary, Mx2 was strongly downregulated (around 5-fold) in cotton rats from both groups on day 1 post challenge (Fig. 8 Mx2), but reached baseline levels again by day 10. There was no difference in expression of Mx1 and Mx2 between non-vaccinated and vaccinated animals. Another response to influenza infection in cotton rats is the upregulation of cytokine expression [19]. We observed that infection led to increased expression levels, particularly of IFN, IFN, IL1 and IL6 on day 1 post challenge. By day 10 expression of these cytokines had declined again though not in all cases to baseline (Fig. 8 IFN, IFN, IL1, IL6). While expression of afore mentioned cytokines clearly peaked shortly after infection and then declined again, expression of IL4 and IL12 did not show such a trend (Fig. 8 IL4, IL12). Vaccination did not have significant effects on cytokine expression. Only for IFN there was a trend to lower expression in vaccinated animals and IL4 expression was higher in 3 out of 4 vaccinated animals as compared to non-vaccinated animals on day one post challenge. 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 142 09-10-18 09:126Chapter 6 142 rats, HI (Fig. 7C) and MN (Fig. 7D) antibodies were undetectable before challenge but were present 10 days post challenge although at lower levels than in vaccinated animals. Fig. 7. Assessment of the functional potential of systemic antibodies by HI and MN assays Serum samples were collected at the 2nd vaccination (d21), day of challenge (d50), and 10 days post homologous challenge (d61) and functionality of the IgG was measured by HI and MN for vaccinated (A,B) and non-vaccinated cotton rats (C,D). HI and MN antibody titers against NIBRG-121 virus are represented as log 2 titers.

Effect of prime/boost vaccination on gene expression in the lungs upon infection. Cotton rats were (mock-)immunized, boosted and challenged as previously described. On day 1 and day 10 after virus challenge cytokine mRNA expression in lungs of the animals was assessed by qRT-PCR with gene specific primers using the housekeeping gene GAPDH as reference. Cotton rat model for flu vaccine evaluation 145 Discussion In this study, we set out to get more insight into the pros and cons of using the cotton rat model for influenza vaccine evaluation, especially by closely monitoring the clinical symptoms in vaccinated cotton rats upon challenge. To this end, we immunized the animals with WIV derived from an H1N1pdm vaccine strain and subsequently infected them with a clinical isolate of H1N1pdm. We demonstrate that all immunized animals developed a humoral immune response against the virus strain. Above a dose of 0.5 \u00b5g antigen, a single immunization as well as prime/boost immunization had clear-cut effects on lung virus titer and survival but rather moderate effects on clinical symptoms upon challenge. Among the clinical parameters studied (weight loss, temperature, breathing frequency), we found that breathing frequency was the most sensitive parameter of infection. In contrast to previous studies we used outbred cotton rats and found variation among the animals acceptable [6,11,12,14,26]. Moreover, the cotton rats used in our studies were fully grown when challenged (age at challenge ~20 weeks) as indicated by the fact that even non- infected animals did not gain weight during the study period. In previous studies, the age of the animals is often not well indicated but the fact that non-infected or protected animals gain about 30 g of weight during a 14-day study period indicates that the animals used were still juvenile [25]. We observed that young animals are much more susceptible to influenza infection than older ones (unpublished observations), thus age is an important parameter to consider in experimental design. We could readily detect virus in the lungs of the animals 1 or 3 days after virus inoculation confirming that the infection was successful. Some of the infected animals were found dead without having shown severe clinical symptoms during the last check-up. Autopsy revealed that these animals had massive inflammation of the lungs. Obviously, the animals can cope rather well even with severe infection but at a given moment deteriorated very quickly. From our observations, we did not get the impression that the sudden deterioration observed in some animals was related to the infection dose as it was observed for different virus doses. A possible explanation could be the virulence of this particular virus strain compared to other H1N1 viruses. Although, the challenge dose was reduced in the 2nd experiment we still saw this rapid deterioration indicating the higher virulence. We observed no or very little effect of the infection on weight and temperature in our experiments. This is in line with Blanco et al who previously reported that infection with 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 144 09-10-18 09:126Chapter 6 144 Fig 8. Effect of prime/boost vaccination on gene expression in the lungs upon infection. Cotton rats were (mock-)immunized, boosted and challenged as previously described.

Although, the challenge dose was reduced in the 2nd experiment we still saw this rapid deterioration indicating the higher virulence. We observed no or very little effect of the infection on weight and temperature in our experiments. This is in line with Blanco et al who previously reported that infection with 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 145 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 6 146 H1N1pdm does not cause overt weight loss and/or drop in temperature in cotton rats, in contrast to infection with other influenza virus strains like H5N1, H3N2, and H9N2 [25]. H1N1pdm infection led, however, to a marked increase in the breathing frequency of the animals, which had not been reported earlier for this virus strain. The peak of increased BF was on day 2 post challenge which correlates with the peak of lung histopathology on day 2 as reported by Blanco et al [25]. Increased BF as prominent disease symptom in cotton rats has also been described for other influenza virus strains and is thought to be caused by damage of epithelial cell layers and the resulting difficulties in breathing might cause death[15] . When investigating gene expression in the lungs of infected cotton rats we found among others an upregulation in the IFN and Mx1 mRNA indicating induction of an antiviral response. Increased expression of IFN and Mx1 has been reported earlier [19,20,25,27] . IFN mediates antiviral responses against influenza by induction of Mx genes and other response modifiers [28]. In cotton rats, IFN expression was found to correlate with replicating virus in the lungs [24]. Interestingly we observed a strong down-regulation in Mx2 mRNA on day 1 post challenge in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals. It is known that Mx2 plays an important antiviral role in the response to infection by hanta virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and La Cross virus, but does not contribute to antiviral responses against influenza in cotton rats and mice [27,29,30] . Down-regulation of Mx2 in our study might be the result of the general shut down of host gene expression observed in influenza-infected cells [31,32]. In agreement with the results of Ottolini et al we also observed induction of IFN, IL6, and IL1 on day 1, coinciding with virus replication in the lungs [19]. IFN is a hallmark of early virus infection and known to play an important role in controlling virus replication in the lungs [28] . IL1 does not play a direct role in influencing influenza infected cells but it can recruit CD4+ T cells to the site of infection, while Il-6 is thought to be necessary for the resolution of influenza infections[33,34]. With respect to vaccination, we observed that a single injection of WIV was sufficient to induce a humoral immune response. A booster vaccination did increase the serum antibody titers significantly, yet, the increase in titers was moderate. Upon infection, the vaccinated animals showed a significantly reduced lung virus titer as compared to control animals. Moreover, all animals vaccinated with 1 or 5 \u00b5g WIV survived the challenge while half of the control animals died. Thus, immunization with WIV was successful in inducing protective immune responses in cotton rats as was earlier reported for immunization with trivalent split and adenovirus-based vaccines [12,26]. Despite the fact that 0.5, 1 and 5 \u00b5g WIV induced comparable antibody titers, Cotton rat model for flu vaccine evaluation 147 half of the animals from the 0.5 \u00b5g WIV group died. This likely indicates that, along with the antibodies, T cells are playing a role in protection of these animals. There is one previous publication showing evidence that memory T cells can contribute to protection [6]. Other potential mechanisms include NA (Neuraminidase) inhibiting antibodies or HA and NA specific antibodies at the mucosal surfaces. Despite the overt effects of vaccination on lung virus titers several observations indicate that vaccination did not result in sterilizing immunity: (i) the breathing frequency in immunized and challenged cotton rats was only slightly lower than in challenged control animals, (ii) infection- induced cytokine production in the lungs was hardly affected, and (iii) the virus infection boosted the vaccine-induced antibody responses. Possibly, virus was still replicating in the nose of immunized and challenged cotton rats and caused enhanced breathing and cytokine induction and provided antigen for B cell stimulation. It has been shown earlier that lung virus titers are more readily controlled by vaccination than nose virus titers [12]. We conclude that under the conditions used in our experiments complete protection was not achieved indicating that the vaccine dose was suboptimal. Increase of vaccine dose and/or use of a different administration route might further improve vaccination outcome. Our results confirm that cotton rats are a suitable model for influenza infection and can be useful for the evaluation of vaccine candidates. However, the model has clear limitations and to use it successfully a number of aspects have to be considered. ( i) The age of the animals is very important. During previous studies we observed that young animals (about 10 weeks) are highly susceptible to influenza virus and their weight drops rapidly upon infection. In contrast, older animals (more than 20 weeks) are rather resistant to infection (unpublished data). (ii ) Disease progression in cotton rats is very rapid as compared to mice which deteriorate more gradually. Cotton rats, upon infection show either little symptoms or die rapidly. In both experiments described in this paper, some non-vaccinated cotton rats were found dead by day 3 or 4, sometimes without showing severe symptoms before. The virus dose used for challenge should therefore be chosen carefully and frequent monitoring of infected animals is indicated to prevent unnecessary suffering. ( iii) The choice of virus strain is also very critical as it determines the clinical symptoms elicited and thus the read-out parameters to be used. As mentioned above, H1N1pdm infection does not affect weight and temperature of cotton rats in contrast to other strains like H5N1, H3N2, and H9N2 [25] . (iv) Even if the experimental conditions are controlled as carefully as possible there might be some variation in disease 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 146 09-10-18 09:126Chapter 6 146 H1N1pdm does not cause overt weight loss and/or drop in temperature in cotton rats, in contrast to infection with other influenza virus strains like H5N1, H3N2, and H9N2 [25].

This could be particularly the case for outbred animals which we chose intentionally as a model closer to the human situation. In conclusion, use of cotton rats for determination of vaccine efficacy with respect to amelioration of clinical symptoms requires careful fine-tuning of the model as mentioned above. Nonetheless, being small, affordable and susceptible to clinical influenza virus isolates cotton rats have their place among the clinically less relevant inbred mouse model and the expensive ferret model for the evaluation of influenza vaccine candidates.

This could be particularly the case for outbred animals which we chose intentionally as a model closer to the human situation. In conclusion, use of cotton rats for determination of vaccine efficacy with respect to amelioration of clinical symptoms requires careful fine-tuning of the model as mentioned above. Nonetheless, being small, affordable and susceptible to clinical influenza virus isolates cotton rats have their place among the clinically less relevant inbred mouse model and the expensive ferret model for the evaluation of influenza vaccine candidates.

A ''universal'' vaccine which confers cross-protection against multiple influenza subtypes and strains is urgently needed. Although recent studies suggest that non-neutralizing antibodies and T cell immunity may play an important role in cross-protective immunity[2,3], there are still many unanswered questions related to cross- protective vaccines. For example, which mechanisms are required for optimal cross-protection? Are these cross-protective immune mechanisms induced by current influenza vaccine? If not, how could current vaccines be improved to enhance their cross-protective effectiveness? If we are going to develop a novel \"universal\" influenza vaccine, which immune responses are essential for it? Moreover, considering most of these studies are performed in animals, how to translate these findings to humans? The work presented in this thesis contributes to a better understanding of cross-protective immune mechanisms, to determine their respective role in protection from infection by diverse influenza virus strains, and to elucidate how these immune responses could be induced, enhanced or altered. Cross-protection induced by infection or vaccination In humans, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm2009) outbreak, it was observed that children and younger people showed higher infection rates than middle-aged adults and old people[4]. Serological studies demonstrate that antibodies which can react with the novel H1N1pdm09 virus were already present in adult or old people before the 2009 pandemic [5]. It is possible that old people were previously infected by antigenically similar H1N1 influenza virus strains. Another possibility may be that those cross-reactive antibodies against the novel 2009 virus in adults and elderly people were induced by multiple infections over time (during their early life). Recent studies show that sequential infection with antigenically distinct virus strains results in increased generation of cross-reactive and potentially cross-protective antibodies against the conserved HA stem region[6]. Meanwhile, it has been reported that sequential infection with different strains of influenza virus could also shift the CD8 T cells immune response in mice[7]. These results indicate that in contrast to infection with a single virus strain, sequential infection with divergent influenza virus strains can induce a cross- reactive immune response against shared antigen(s) which may contribute to a certain level of cross-protection. Summarizing discussion 153 To understand the cross-protective immune responses induced by sequential live virus infection, in chapter 2 , mice were sequentially infected with antigenically distinct virus strains, PR8 and X-31, to mimic the infection situation in humans. In addition, we immunized mice with whole inactivated influenza virus (WIV) vaccines or subunit (SU) vaccines derived from these two strains of virus. Through analyzing the cross-protective immune response induced by sequential live virus infection in mice, we wanted to figure out which immune responses are required for optimal cross-protection. Furthermore, through comparing the different mechanisms induced by multiple live virus infection and WIV vaccination, we attempted to determine if the effectiveness of cross-protection induced by current influenza vaccines could be enhanced. Our results show that sequential infection with PR8 and X-31 virus provided solid cross- protection against H1N1pdm09 viral infection. Cross-protection was mediated by non- neutralizing, cross-reactive antibodies and CD8 effector memory T cells (TEM). Partial cross- protection was provided by sequential vaccination with WIV and was associated with CD8 central memory T cells (TCM) and to a minor extent with cross-reactive antibodies. In contrast, sequential vaccination with SU vaccine only induced a minimal amount of cross-reactive serum antibodies and no T cell immunity against H1N1pdm09 and could not provide cross-protection. Notably, we found that non-neutralizing antibodies induced by sequential infection provided effective cross-protection. This contrasts with previous publications that serum antibodies induced by single live virus infection cannot provide cross-protection[8,9]. A recent study by Nachbagauer et al. reported that secondary exposure to divergent virus strains from the same HA group can induce higher levels of cross-reactive antibodies than a single infection[10]. This may be because the second infection could enhance the generation of cross-reactive antibody against shared antigens. Thus, we speculate that sequential infection may specifically enhance the generation of non-neutralizing antibodies against conserved proteins which then may be responsible for cross-protection. Indeed, in our study substantial amounts of cross-reactive antibody against M2e and NP were found in the sequential infection group. Several parameters could explain the lower cross-protective activity of antibodies induced by sequential WIV or SU vaccination compared to sequential infection. We observed that cross- reactive antibody titers induced by sequential WIV immunization were around 20-fold lower than those evoked by sequential infection. Another possible explanation may be that cross- reactive antibodies induced by sequential WIV vaccination showed a narrower binding spectrum than those induced by sequential infection, since e.g. anti-M2e antibodies were only induced in the sequential infection group. Therefore, we speculate that the lower magnitude and 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 152 09-10-18 09:127Chapter 7 152 Background Influenza viral infections are a serious threat to human health, resulting in about 290,000 to 650,000 deaths globally each year[1].

Besides that, DiLillo et al reported that mice which received the IgG2a (Th1-type) form of 6F12 bNAb (targeting to HA stem) showed minimal weight loss whereas mice which received the IgG1 (Th2-type) form of 6F12 bNAb showed significant weight loss similar to that of mock- treated mice[11]. This indicates that Th1-type antibodies exhibit stronger cross-protective capacity than Th2-type antibodies. Sequential SU vaccination only induced a limited amount of cross-reactive antibody which was of the Th2-type. This may also partly explain why sequential SU vaccination cannot provide cross-protection. Understanding how non-neutralizing antibodies induced by sequential infection provide potent cross-protection would benefit the development of cross-protective vaccines. It has been reported that non-neutralizing antibodies can provide cross-protection by a number of Fc- receptor dependent mechanisms, including complement-mediated lysis[12,13], antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP)[14,15] and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)[3,16,17]. The ability of influenza vaccines and live virus infection to induce ADCC- Abs has been investigated. Two doses of TIV (subunit vaccine) immunization could not induce ADCC-Abs, whereas H1N1 or H3N2 live virus infection could induce robust ADCC-Abs in animal model[18]. To some extent, these results are in line with our findings, since non- neutralizing antibodies induced by sequential infection provided cross-protection whereas non- neutralizing antibodies induced by sequential WIV only showed a minor effect. We still do not know which mechanisms are responsible for the cross-protection provided by these non- neutralizing antibodies. Future work should be performed to improve our understanding about these mechanisms. Knowledge about how these non-neutralizing antibodies could be effectively induced is essential for the development of cross-protective vaccines. In addition to cross-reactive antibody immune responses, recent studies show that cross- reactive T cells are also correlated with cross-protection in humans and animals[8,19,20]. In our study, it is noted that sequential virus infection induced large amounts of cross-reactive CD8 T cells in lung and spleen and these cells had mainly an effector memory phenotype (TEM). This result is in line with previous findings that a single influenza infection mainly induces influenza-specific CD8 TEM cells[21]. Interestingly, sequential WIV vaccination was found to induce a limited amount of cross-reactive CD8 T cells, but these cells were found only in the spleen and had a central memory phenotype (TCM). It makes sense that sequential SU immunization could not induce cross-reactive CD8 T cell immune response, since there are no Summarizing discussion 155 conserved proteins present in SU vaccines. Depletion of CD8 T cells in sequentially infected mice resulted in enhanced lung virus titers compared to those in sequentially infected non- depleted mice. This result indicates that CD8 T cells induced by sequential infection do play a role in cross-protection. Similarly, depletion of CD8 T cells induced by sequential WIV immunization resulted in lung virus titers similar to those in PBS mock vaccinated mice, implying that CD8 T cells are also important for cross-protection induced by sequential WIV immunization. These results agree with previous findings that CD8 T cells induced by WIV were responsible for cross-protection against heterologous virus infection in mice[22-24]. Nevertheless, some questions remain to be answered. For example, do different phenotypes of memory CD8 T cells show the same cross-protective potential? Previous publications have shown that CD8 TEM cells are associated with a fast recall immune response to the infection site, thus providing immediate cross-protection whereas CD8 TCM cells have high proliferative capability in secondary lymphoid organs but provide delayed cross-protection[21,25,26]. These findings may partly explain why sequential infection provides full cross-protection, but sequential vaccination only could provide partial cross-protection from day 5 post infection in our study. Further studies should be performed to understand the different contribution of these cells to cross-protection. As indicated in chapter 1, a new phenotype of memory CD8 T cells, lung resident memory CD8 T cells, were found in animals and humans[27,28]. It has been reported that these cells were required for optimal cross-protection in animals[29,30]. Another recent study stresses that tissue resident CD8 T cells in the nasal rather than the lung epithelium are the most important cells for cross-protection[31]. A published study by Zens et al showed that lung resident memory CD8 T cells can be induced by LAIV[32]. Whether lung resident memory CD8 T cells can also be induced by WIV vaccination should be investigated in future studies. In summary, we found that sequential infection with different live influenza virus strains induced non-neutralizing antibodies and cross-reactive CD8 T cells. Each of these mechanisms alone was of sufficient magnitude to provide cross-protection. Although non-neutralizing antibodies and cross-reactive CD8 T cells induced by sequential WIV vaccination also contributed to cross-protection, neither of them alone was strong enough to provide a significant protective effect. Thus, in chapter 3 , we tested whether cross-protection could be enhanced by adding adjuvants such as CAF01, CAF09, CTA1-DD and CTA1-3M2e- DD to WIV vaccine. We hypothesized that a universal vaccine should induce both significant 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 154 09-10-18 09:127Chapter 7 154 narrower spectrum antibodies induced by sequential WIV vaccination compared to sequential infection may be responsible for their lower cross-protective activity. Besides that, DiLillo et al reported that mice which received the IgG2a (Th1-type) form of 6F12 bNAb (targeting to HA stem) showed minimal weight loss whereas mice which received the IgG1 (Th2-type) form of 6F12 bNAb showed significant weight loss similar to that of mock- treated mice[11]. This indicates that Th1-type antibodies exhibit stronger cross-protective capacity than Th2-type antibodies. Sequential SU vaccination only induced a limited amount of cross-reactive antibody which was of the Th2-type. This may also partly explain why sequential SU vaccination cannot provide cross-protection.

The ability of influenza vaccines and live virus infection to induce ADCC- Abs has been investigated. Two doses of TIV (subunit vaccine) immunization could not induce ADCC-Abs, whereas H1N1 or H3N2 live virus infection could induce robust ADCC-Abs in animal model[18]. To some extent, these results are in line with our findings, since non- neutralizing antibodies induced by sequential infection provided cross-protection whereas non- neutralizing antibodies induced by sequential WIV only showed a minor effect. We still do not know which mechanisms are responsible for the cross-protection provided by these non- neutralizing antibodies. Future work should be performed to improve our understanding about these mechanisms. Knowledge about how these non-neutralizing antibodies could be effectively induced is essential for the development of cross-protective vaccines. In addition to cross-reactive antibody immune responses, recent studies show that cross- reactive T cells are also correlated with cross-protection in humans and animals[8,19,20]. In our study, it is noted that sequential virus infection induced large amounts of cross-reactive CD8 T cells in lung and spleen and these cells had mainly an effector memory phenotype (TEM). This result is in line with previous findings that a single influenza infection mainly induces influenza-specific CD8 TEM cells[21]. Interestingly, sequential WIV vaccination was found to induce a limited amount of cross-reactive CD8 T cells, but these cells were found only in the spleen and had a central memory phenotype (TCM). It makes sense that sequential SU immunization could not induce cross-reactive CD8 T cell immune response, since there are no Summarizing discussion 155 conserved proteins present in SU vaccines. Depletion of CD8 T cells in sequentially infected mice resulted in enhanced lung virus titers compared to those in sequentially infected non- depleted mice. This result indicates that CD8 T cells induced by sequential infection do play a role in cross-protection. Similarly, depletion of CD8 T cells induced by sequential WIV immunization resulted in lung virus titers similar to those in PBS mock vaccinated mice, implying that CD8 T cells are also important for cross-protection induced by sequential WIV immunization. These results agree with previous findings that CD8 T cells induced by WIV were responsible for cross-protection against heterologous virus infection in mice[22-24]. Nevertheless, some questions remain to be answered. For example, do different phenotypes of memory CD8 T cells show the same cross-protective potential? Previous publications have shown that CD8 TEM cells are associated with a fast recall immune response to the infection site, thus providing immediate cross-protection whereas CD8 TCM cells have high proliferative capability in secondary lymphoid organs but provide delayed cross-protection[21,25,26]. These findings may partly explain why sequential infection provides full cross-protection, but sequential vaccination only could provide partial cross-protection from day 5 post infection in our study. Further studies should be performed to understand the different contribution of these cells to cross-protection. As indicated in chapter 1, a new phenotype of memory CD8 T cells, lung resident memory CD8 T cells, were found in animals and humans[27,28]. It has been reported that these cells were required for optimal cross-protection in animals[29,30]. Another recent study stresses that tissue resident CD8 T cells in the nasal rather than the lung epithelium are the most important cells for cross-protection[31]. A published study by Zens et al showed that lung resident memory CD8 T cells can be induced by LAIV[32]. Whether lung resident memory CD8 T cells can also be induced by WIV vaccination should be investigated in future studies. In summary, we found that sequential infection with different live influenza virus strains induced non-neutralizing antibodies and cross-reactive CD8 T cells. Each of these mechanisms alone was of sufficient magnitude to provide cross-protection. Although non-neutralizing antibodies and cross-reactive CD8 T cells induced by sequential WIV vaccination also contributed to cross-protection, neither of them alone was strong enough to provide a significant protective effect. Thus, in chapter 3 , we tested whether cross-protection could be enhanced by adding adjuvants such as CAF01, CAF09, CTA1-DD and CTA1-3M2e- DD to WIV vaccine. We hypothesized that a universal vaccine should induce both significant 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 155 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 7 156 cross-reactive antibody immune responses and CD8 T cells immune responses. To test this hypothesis, thus, we developed a virosome-based vaccine which induces not only cross-reactive antibodies but also cross-reactive CD8 T cells. In chapter 4 , we evaluated the cross-protection induced by this vaccine in mice. Adjuvants enhance the cross-protection In chapter 2, we gained more insight into the kind of immune responses that are capable of controlling heterologous influenza infection. It was key to understand how to manipulate innate immune responses using different adjuvants and/or delivery routes to enhance these cross- protective immune responses. In chapter 3, we therefore compared the liposome-based adjuvants (CAF01 CTA1-3M2e-DD) head-to-head to determine their relative efficacy to enhance the cross-protection induced by WIV vaccination. Our results show that i.n. immunization with CAF09-, CTA1-DD- or CTA1-3M2e-DD-adjuvanted WIV provided with WIV or WIV plus CAF01-adjuvant. Moreover, WIV combined with a mucosal adjuvant not only provided cross- protection against heterologous but also against heterosubtypic virus infection. We further found that non-neutralizing serum IgG, mucosal IgA and IFN-producing CD4 higher for WIV with mucosal adjuvants than for non-adjuvanted vaccines. Mechanistic experiments revealed that non-neutralizing serum antibodies and CD4 T cells were involved in the observed cross-protection while IgA antibody seemed to play only a minor role. We found that i.n. immunization with WIV plus mucosal adjuvant induced around 10 times more non-neutralizing antibodies than WIV alone. In chapter 2, we also found that sequential infection induced around 20 times more non-neutralizing antibodies than sequential WIV vaccination. This result indicates that the antibody titers in WIV plus mucosal adjuvant group were of similar magnitude as those in the live virus infection group (in chapter 2). This observation could explain why non-neutralizing antibodies induced (in chapter 3) by WIV plus mucosal adjuvant provided cross-protection. Taken together, our results imply that adding adjuvant to significantly enhance the generation of non-neutralizing antibodies may be a strategy to improve the cross-protective potential of WIV. In chapter 2 we concluded that CD4 T cells are not essential for cross-protection. This might be because large amounts of non-neutralizing antibodies and cross-reactive CD8 T cells were present. These antibodies or CD8 T cells alone could significantly reduce the lung virus titer Summarizing discussion 157 even in the absence of CD4 T cells. In chapter 3 , although depletion of CD4 T cells resulted in increased virus titers only in the WIV plus CTA1-3M2e-DD group, this result still indicates that CD4 T cells can contribute to a decrease in the virus titer in mice. This fits with the high numbers of influenza-specific CD4 T cells detected in this group and indicates that CD4 T cells can contribute to cross-protection when present in high numbers. This finding is in line with previous observations that memory CD4 T cells induced by live virus infection provided cross- protection in mice and humans[8,9,20] Therefore, instead of increasing CD8 T cells, specifically enhancing the generation of cross-reactive CD4 T cells by adjuvant might also improve the cross-protective capacity of WIV. In the literature and in our own study, vaccination with WIV plus mucosal adjuvants led to remarkably enhanced levels of cross-reactive local IgA in lungs and nasal mucosa of animal[33-35]. It has been shown that IgA antibody contributes to cross-protection to influenza[36,37]. However, in our study IgA KO mice were protected from heterosubtypic challenge to a similar extent as wildtype BALB/c mice. This indicates that local IgA did not play a crucial role in cross-protection induced by i.n. administered adjuvanted WIV. These results underline that immunization with WIV plus mucosal adjuvant activates a range of cross-protective immune responses. Exploiting new adjuvants thus paves the way for the development of a \"universal\" influenza vaccine. Novel modified virosomes induce cross-protection Current research on universal influenza vaccines is mainly directed at targeting conserved proteins of the influenza virus. Aside from broadly-protective neutralizing antibodies, cross- reactive T cells are also considered to be an important component of future influenza vaccines[38]. In chapter 2, we confirmed that both cross-reactive antibody and cross-reactive CD8 T cells are required for optimal cross-protection. However, effective cross- reactive CD8 T cells against conserved epitope of influenza virus is challenging due to the low capacity for conserved proteins entering the cytosol of APCs. Influenza virosomes are reconstituted membrane envelopes which contain only the membrane lipids and the surface proteins of virus[39,40]. Virosomes were demonstrated to be an efficient delivery system for peptides to induce CD8 T cells in previous studies[40-42]. In these studies, conserved peptides were associated or encapsulated into virosomes[40,41]. However, the 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 156 09-10-18 09:127Chapter 7 156 cross-reactive antibody immune responses and CD8 T cells immune responses. To test this hypothesis, thus, we developed a virosome-based vaccine which induces not only cross-reactive antibodies but also cross-reactive CD8 T cells.

Virosomes were demonstrated to be an efficient delivery system for peptides to induce CD8 T cells in previous studies[40-42]. In these studies, conserved peptides were associated or encapsulated into virosomes[40,41]. However, the 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 157 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 7 158 association or encapsulation rates of peptides is extremely low, which limits the amount of CD8 T cells induced by these virosomes. In chapter 4 , we developed a modified influenza virosome with DOGs-NTA-Ni lipid and TLR4-ligand MPLA incorporated in the membrane. DOGS-NTA-Ni lipid has been used to facilitate the association of his-tagged peptides to liposomes[43]. To our knowledge, it is the first time that DOGs-NTA-Ni is used in influenza virosomes. We found that presence of DOGS-NTA-Ni allowed the conjugation of large amounts of his-tagged proteins onto the virosomes. Previously, free proteins or peptides were directly encapsulated into influenza virosomes[44] which resulted in encapsulation of only around 225 ovalbumin (OVA) molecules per virosomal particle. In our study, we estimate that one DOGs-NTA-Ni-containing-virosome could be conjugated with around 12000 molecules of NP, indicating that incorporated DOGs-NTA-Ni could facilitate association of about 50 times more NP than could be achieved by passive encapsulation. These results imply that DOGs- NTA-Ni could be a promising linker for the conjugation of his-tagged proteins to delivery systems. In addition, MPLA was incorporated into the DOGs-NTA-Ni-containing-virosomes. In vitro, MPLA significantly enhanced the activation of APCs. A published study shows that incorporation of MPLA into glycoliposomes induced significantly higher cross-presentation of a peptide 280-288 ) compared to soluble MPLA mixed with glycoliposomes[45]. Based on these findings, future studies should be designed to determine whether incorporated MPLA could increase the cross-presentation of NP protein. Moreover, Kamphuis et al reported that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) virosomes with incorporated MPLA significantly skewed the immune response towards a Th1 phenotype[46]. As indicate before, Th1 immunity exhibited higher cross-protective capacity than Th2 immunity. On basis of these studies and our own observations, we speculate that incorporated MPLA could enhance the cross-protective capacity by activation of APCs, enhancing the cross-presentation of conserved antigens and skewing the immune response to a Th1 phenotype. MPLA would thus be a promising adjuvant for the development of cross-protective influenza vaccines. We found that virosomes with attached NP induced a higher amount of NP-specific CTLs than virosomes with mixed NP, but these two vaccinations exhibited similar cross-protective capacity against heterosubtypic influenza virus infection. This result indicates that NP-specific CTLs may not be crucial for cross-protection in this study, and another mechanism may be involved. A study by Carragher et al showed that adoptively transferred anti-NP antibody could provide cross-protection against heterologous virus infection[47]. Anti-NP antibody induced Summarizing discussion 159 by virosomes with attached NP or mixed NP may contribute to the observed cross-protection. Previous studies showed that cross-reactive antibodies targeting the HA stem region and conserved part of NA can play an important role in cross-protection[48-50]. This could partly explain why virosomes without NP also provided cross-protection in our study. Collectively, we speculate that cross-reactive antibodies against HA, NA and NP proteins may be responsible cross-protection in our study. In summary, we developed an \"all-in-one\" vaccine with incorporated adjuvant and attached conserved NP proteins. This \"all-in-one\" virosome vaccines could induce not only cross- reactive CTLs against conserved proteins of influenza virus, but also cross-reactive antibodies against conserved influenza proteins. These \"all-in-one\" virosomes could be exploited as a platform to induce potent cross-protective immunity against influenza virus infection. Prior infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae alters immune responses Most of our understanding of cross-protection induced by prior infection or vaccination comes from experiments performed on specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice. However, whether such cross-protective responses reflect those in free-living organisms remains unknown. By analyzing the gene expression in the blood of mice, recent publications showed that the immune response in na\u00efve SPF mouse is different from the immune response in pet mice and wild mice[51,52]. Moreover, co-housing SPF mice with pet mice resulted in an increase of highly differentiated effector memory cells in SPF mice, which indicates that exposure of SPF mice to pathogens alters the immune response of these mice[51]. Furthermore, Reese et al reported that sequential infection of SPF mice with common pathogens, such as herpesviruses, influenza virus, or helminths, significantly changes the immune response and subsequently influences the immune response induced by vaccines[53]. These studies indicate that pre-existing immunity induced by exposure to different pathogens can influence the effectiveness of vaccines in animal models. A new mouse model which can better reflect the complicated immune response induced by previous infection in humans would be desirable for evaluation of (universal) influenza vaccines. Thus, as a part of this dissertation, in chapter 5 , we investigated whether previous infection of mice with Streptococcus pneumonia could alter the immune response induced by WIV vaccination in SPF mice. SPF mice were first infected with Streptococcus pneumonia intranasally and then vaccinated with PR8 WIV intramuscularly. We found that total anti-PR8 IgM was similar in Streptococcus pneumoniae -infected and mock-infected mice on day 7, 14 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 158 09-10-18 09:127Chapter 7 158 association or encapsulation rates of peptides is extremely low, which limits the amount of CD8 T cells induced by these virosomes.

SPF mice were first infected with Streptococcus pneumonia intranasally and then vaccinated with PR8 WIV intramuscularly. We found that total anti-PR8 IgM was similar in Streptococcus pneumoniae -infected and mock-infected mice on day 7, 14 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 159 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 7 160 and 28 post vaccination. However, total anti-PR8 IgG was lower in Streptococcus pneumoniae - infected mice than in mock-infected mice on day 7 post vaccination, but not on day 14 and day 21 post vaccination. Moreover, anti-PR8 IgG2a antibody was lower and anti-PR8 IgG1 antibody was higher in Streptococcus pneumoniae -infected mice compared to mock-infected mice on day 7 post vaccination. Reese et al reported that co-infected mice and SPF mice exhibited equivalent antibody responses early after vaccination against yellow fever virus (YFV-17d), but by day 34 total anti-YFV-17D IgG was lower in co-infected mice compared with SPF mice. Reese also observed a lower antibody titer in co-infected mice but that the kinetics were different. Our results indicate that prior exposure to Streptococcus pneumoniae not only inhibits the generation of influenza-specific IgG but also skews the immune response to a Th2 type at the early stage of vaccination at the beginning of vaccination. However, whether these skewed immune responses could influence the protection against live virus infection remains unknown. In the literature, besides antibody immune responses, T cell immune response are also correlated with protection against influenza virus infection. As indicated before, influenza- specific T cells immune response can be induced by whole inactivated influenza vaccines[22,23]. It remains to be investigated whether prior infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae alters the T cell immunity induced by WIV vaccination. The influence of the microbial environment on the T cell composition of the immune system in mice was tested by Beura et al [51]. They found that lower numbers of memory CD8 T cells were present and were almost entirely comprised of cells with a central memory phenotype in SPF mice. Greater numbers of memory CD8 T cells were found in pet store mice or wild mice. Moreover, by analyzing the T cell immune response in blood and nonlymphoid organ, they found that there are almost no tissue-resident memory T cells in SPF mice. In contrast, wild mice or pet store mice showed effector-memory and tissue-resident memory T cells . Another study by Abolins et al confirmed these findings[52]. Collectively, these studies indicate that (co-)infection by specific pathogens may shape T cell immunity in SPF mice. Whether such shifted pre- vaccination T cells immunity could influence the generation of influenza-specific T cell immunity induced by WIV vaccination with respect to phenotype and amount should be clarified in future studies. A cotton rat model for evaluation of WIV Although mice are widely used to evaluate the protective potential of novel influenza vaccines, the translation of the findings in mice to humans has been questioned. One of the reasons may Summarizing discussion 161 be that most of the strains of influenza viruses isolated from patients need to be adapted to achieve effective infection in mice. Using these pre-adapted strains for the evaluation of influenza vaccine in mice cannot reflect the protection against the circulating virus in humans. Thus, other animal models which can be directly infected by clinical strains of influenza should be developed to evaluate the effectiveness of influenza vaccine. Cotton rats have been used as a model to study the pathogenesis of influenza[54,55]. One reason for this was that adaptation of human influenza strains is not required for virus replication and the development of disease in cotton rats. Intranasal infection of un-adapted human influenza viruses results in viral replication in the lower and upper respiratory tract in cotton rats. The kinetic of virus replication in cotton rats is similar to that observed in humans who were experimentally infected by wild type virus[56]. Moreover, it has been observed that virus could be cleared from the noses of cotton rates by 6 days post-infection[54]. These similarities between cotton rats and humans make cotton rats a suitable model for study of influenza infection. Recently, cotton rats also have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of influenza vaccines but lung virus titer was the only parameter evaluated[57,58]. Are there any other parameters that correlate with the clinical symptoms caused by virus challenge after vaccination in cotton rats? In chapter 6 , we immunized cotton rats with a single high dose or two moderate doses of WIV. Clinical parameters, such as weight loss, temperature and breathing frequency, were monitored daily. Corroborating previous results[59], we found that WIV vaccination could induce high amounts of antibodies and lung virus titers were significantly reduced. These results are in line with previous publications[57]. Notably, we found that virus challenge significantly increased the breathing frequency of cotton rats. Moreover, the increased breathing frequency started to return to baseline in WIV-vaccinated cotton rats on day two post challenge. We therefore demonstrated that the clinical symptoms caused by influenza challenge could be reduced by WIV vaccination in cotton rats. This result indicates that breathing frequency could be a potential indicator for the protective efficacy of the vaccine. We found that antibody immune responses induced by WIV vaccination were correlated with protection in cotton rats. However, in mice, it has been reported that cellular immunity also plays an important role in (cross-)protection against influenza virus infection. Thus, we speculate that cellular immunity may also contribute to protection in cotton rats. A previous publication by Eichelberger et al supports this hypothesis[60]. In that study, they found that primary infection of cotton rats with influenza virus resulted in the accumulation of CD4 T cells 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 160 09-10-18 09:127Chapter 7 160 and 28 post vaccination.

Moreover, the increased breathing frequency started to return to baseline in WIV-vaccinated cotton rats on day two post challenge. We therefore demonstrated that the clinical symptoms caused by influenza challenge could be reduced by WIV vaccination in cotton rats. This result indicates that breathing frequency could be a potential indicator for the protective efficacy of the vaccine. We found that antibody immune responses induced by WIV vaccination were correlated with protection in cotton rats. However, in mice, it has been reported that cellular immunity also plays an important role in (cross-)protection against influenza virus infection. Thus, we speculate that cellular immunity may also contribute to protection in cotton rats. A previous publication by Eichelberger et al supports this hypothesis[60]. In that study, they found that primary infection of cotton rats with influenza virus resulted in the accumulation of CD4 T cells 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 161 09-10-18 09:12Chapter 7 162 in the BAL fluid. In contrast, a large population of T cells that were CD4 negative (most possibly CD8 positive) were present in the BAL fluid of cotton rats following secondary infection with a heterosubtypic virus. Moreover, these cells were most prevalent when the challenge virus shared the same internal antigens with the primary virus, suggesting that these cells may be CD8 T cells directed against conserved epitopes. However, in how far cellular immunity contributes to protection in cotton rats remains elusive. Future studies should be performed to determine if T cell immunity is induced by vaccination in cotton rats. In summary, cotton rats could be a suitable model for studies of influenza virus infection and the evaluation of influenza vaccines due to several reasons. Although there are several immune parameters that remain to be characterized in cotton rats, our study indicates that breathing frequency could be a potential indicator of the protective efficacy of WIV and other vaccines. Concluding remarks and future perspective Through comparing the different cross-protective immune mechanisms induced by sequential live virus infection and immunization, we conclude that cross-reactive antibodies, cross- reactive CD8 T cell immunity and CD4 T cell immunity are required for optimal cross- protection but neither of them is crucial for cross-protection. WIV vaccination can also induce non-neutralizing antibody and cross-reactive CD8 T cells but with lower amounts of antibodies and different phenotypes of CD8 T cells compared with live virus infection. Adding liposome-based adjuvant (such as CAF09) or protein-based adjuvant (such as CTA1- DD or CTA1-3M2e-DD) to WIV enhanced the cross-protection in mice. Moreover, intranasally administered WIV plus mucosal adjuvants induced higher cross-protection CAF01 administered intramuscularly. Non-neutralizing antibodies and cross-reactive CD8 T cells can be induced by our novel \"all- in-one\" influenza virosomes. Thus, \"all-in-one\" virosomes have the potential to be exploited as a \"universal\" influenza vaccine. All these experiments (and those of others) have been performed in mice which have 2 drawbacks: 1) they are SPF and 2) they are not susceptible to clinical virus isolates. SPF mice are not a good animal model for the evaluation of influenza vaccine, because prior infection by unrelated pathogen, such as Streptococcus pneumonia, resulted in altered antibody immune response induced by WIV vaccination. Cotton rats are susceptible to clinical influenza isolates and could be exploited as a suitable model for the evaluation of influenza vaccines. Breathing Summarizing discussion 163 frequency of cotton rats could be a potential indicator of the protective efficacy of the vaccine. Yet, this animal model still cannot reflect the complicated infection history in humans. Taken together, our findings indicate that to provide optimal cross-protection against influenza, a 'universal' cross-protective vaccine which could induce non-neutralization antibody response, cross-protective CD4 and CD8 T cell responses is required. Moreover, a better animal model which could reflect the real infection history of humans is also needed. The studies described here have focused on the cross-protective adaptive immunities, such as non-neutralizing antibodies, CD4 and CD8 T cells, against influenza A viruses in animal models. In recent years, increased evidence suggested that the magnitude of the adaptive immune response can be altered by the innate immune system[61]. Yet, which subsets of innate immune cells would be needed and how these immune cells influence the adaptive immune response during influenza virus infection/vaccination remains unclear. In the literature, it has been demonstrated that the innate immune system also play an important role in sensing vaccine and adjuvants [62]. Therefore, in future studies, understanding how to manipulate innate immune responses using influenza vaccine and adjuvants so as to generate appropriate adaptive immune response is important to further guide the development of \"universal' influenza vaccine. Emerging evidence suggests that innate immune cells also cooperate with certain adaptive immune responses for effective cross-protection. Different kinds of innate immune cells, such as NK cells, macrophage, neutrophil or other monocytes, are required for cross-protection relying on non-neutralizing antibodies [3]. By binding via Fc receptors to antibody-opsonized infected cells, innate immune cells can clear virus-infected cells by different mechanisms. Laidlaw et al reported that depletion of alveolar macrophages (and possibly other alveolar phagocytes) resulted in increased morbidity compared to mock depleted mice, indicating non- neutralizing antibodies, CD8 T cells and macrophages/lung phagocytes synergize to provide better cross-protection [38]. Future universal influenza vaccines should thus aim at simultaneous induction of antibody and cellular immunity. It will also be of interest to understand the synergizing mechanism of innate immunity and adaptive immunity to provide better cross-protection. 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 162 09-10-18 09:127Chapter 7 162 in the BAL fluid.

Appendices 175 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I still remember the first day when I came to Groningen around five years ago and Jos\u00e9 brought me to my room and UMCG, from where I started my PhD journey. Time is flying. Now I am almost at the end of this Journey. When I look back, I realize that the completion of my PhD journey would be impossible without many people along this journey. First, I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Anke Huckriede. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to do my PhD in your group. Dear Anke, you are the best supervisor I have ever met. You are always supportive and optimistic. Whenever I feel frustrated with my projects, you always encourage me and help me solve the problems in my experiments. You always motivate and push me in a nice way. I enjoy working with you. Thanks for teaching me how to give a presentation and how to write a paper patiently. Besides that, you are helpful in my daily life. I will always remember that the bedclothes you and Marijke brought for me at the first week when I arrived in Groningen. I would like to thank Amber. When I was a master student, you were already my 'supervisor' and friend. Thanks very much for your help at the beginning of my research. After coming back from Groningen, I am happy to see you again in Shantou. You were still very enthusiastic to help me design experiments at that time. After you found a new job in Canada, you were still willing to help me with my thesis writing. Thank you so much. I wish you and your family have a good time in Canada. I also thank another supervisor David Kelvin, although you are too busy to help me. I would like to thank Toos, Jolanda S. Aalen and Iza for your questions and suggestions during my presentations. I would like to express my gratitude to Jolanda O for helping me with all the paper work and lots of good suggestion related to my life in Groningen. I also would like to thank the assessment committee, Prof. dr. C. McCormick,Prof. P. Heeringa and Prof. dr. E. Hak. Thanks for your evaluation of my thesis and suggestions to improve the quality of my thesis. Dear Marijke, you were so helpful during my study in Groningen. Thank you for training me to produce virosome and help me figure out all the problems in the lab. Besides that, you are so nice to help me solve the problems in my life. I will always remember that you and Harry came to my place and showed me how to use wash machine in my room. Thanks very much for your help. I really like the food you and Harry prepared at your place, especially the Chinese fondue. 15850-Dong_BNW.indd 174 de essentieel is.
