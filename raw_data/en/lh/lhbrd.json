Throughout his lifetime, Christ Jesus responded to those desires by preaching the gospel of God's kingdom and by healing the sick and those who had lost their way. He taught his followers how to be Christian healers, too. How can we heal like Jesus did? It starts with a childlike faith in God's constant goodness and love, and a wholehearted yearning to understand the spiritual laws of God that govern all of us. When these laws become tangible to us, and good seems more natural and real to us, healing follows. This Science of Christian healing was discovered by Mary Baker Eddy, who wrote the book Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures. Her Bible-based textbook on spiritual healing has helped people around the world experience health and solutions to all types of suffering. Living and sharing this spiritual, scientific method of healing based on Jesus' teachings is the continuing mission of this Church. We invite you to explore Christian Science healing today. You'll see how anyone can benefit from this practical, prayer-based approach to improve their lives. "}
