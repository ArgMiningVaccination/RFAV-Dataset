This system works in coordination with our cardiovascular and immune system to aid in circulation of our interstitial fluid. It is also considered an essential part of our circulatory system. Lymph nodes are the primary \"organs\" that comprise the lymphatic system, with up to 700 throughout the body. There is no pumping mechanism, like in our heart, to keep things flowing smoothly. The pressure created from the movement of our muscles keeps fluid flowing smoothly.

Lymphatic massage This is a special form of massage targeted towards your lymph system. It is very light pressure as the system is mostly superficial with specific movements to stimulate the system. Studies have shown it can vastly improve circulation and aids in pushing waste back into the bloodstream. We have a certified massage therapist at our center if this sounds interesting to you. 3. Dry brushing This is an ancient Traditional Chinese Medicine practice and is commonly taught in Ayurvedic medicine. Take a coarse, dry bristle brush and brush your legs, arms, and torso in the direction of your heart. This assists in the movement of lymph and blood which will help clear out built up toxins.
