Booster doses help protect against getting very sick from COVID-19 including against hospitalization and death. | | What is the difference between a \"three-dose primary series\" and a \"booster dose\"? | | A 'three-dose' primary series refers to a series of three doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to make up a primary series offered to those who are immunocompromised or vulnerable. A third dose is added to the standard \"primary vaccine series\" to improve the immune response and establish an adequate level of protection for those who did not develop immunity or did not develop an optimal immune response after a 2-dose primary series. In short - a primary series for most healthy people remains 2-doses, and for these people, a third (booster) dose is offered to boost the immune system. A three-dose primary series is offered to those who are immunocompromised to ensure they have an adequate immune response and are protected. |Do I need a booster dose if I had COVID-19 recently and have some natural immunity?| | | COVID-19 vaccination, including booster doses, are recommended for everyone regardless of previous COVID-19 infection. Review the booster eligibility |How soon can I get a booster dose after a COVID-19 infection or suspected infection?| | | People who have had a previous COVID-19 infection are still recommended to receive a booster. It is recommended to wait for six months (168 days) after symptoms started or after testing positive (if no symptoms were experienced) before receiving a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine. However, people may receive their booster when they have Vaccine receipts |How do I get a copy of my 'vaccine receipt' after I have been vaccinated?| | | After each dose of the COVID-19 vaccine that you get, you will be able to log into the You will need the following to log into the provincial portal: A green photo health (OHIP) card (you will need the numbers from the front and back of the card, expired cards will be accepted) Your date of birth Your postal code that is associated with your health card | | Can Ottawa Public Health upload vaccine exemptions documents to the Verify Ontario app, so I can use my QR code to show proof my medical or clinical exemption? | | Any person who has a medical exemption to COVID-19 vaccines will need a provincially issued digital QR Code to access certain businesses and settings that voluntarily require proof of vaccination. Medical exemptions to obtain the QR code can only be granted by physicians and nurse practitioners licensed in Ontario. Once proper documentation is received from a physician or nurse practitioner Ottawa Public Health can generate the QR codes. As per provincial guidance, true medical exemptions are expected to be infrequent and should be supported by expert consultation. Further information is available for | | Can I update my vaccine receipt with my chosen name? | | Trans and non-binary people living To request this change online, complete this Please bring original copies of the following documentation with you to request this change in person. Scanned copies of the following original documents will be accepted for online submissions: Accessibility |Am I eligible for in-home vaccination?| | | |How do I make a request if I require disability-related accommodations?| | | If you require additional disability-related accommodations, please fill out this Should you need assistance in completing the accommodation request form, please contact Ottawa Public Health at 613-691-5505. Novavax (Nuvaxovid) COVID-19 vaccine |What is a recombinant protein subunit vaccine?| | | A recombinant protein subunit vaccine is a type of vaccine that uses harmless and purified proteins of the virus to trigger an immune response in the body. The immune response means our body will recognize and fight the virus if ever exposed. Some protein subunit vaccines, such as Novavax, also have adjuvants. An adjuvant is a substance that is added to the vaccine to help create a stronger and longer lasting immune response. These types of vaccines cannot cause COVID-19. They only use small, purified pieces of proteins to trigger the immune response, and do not contain the virus itself. Protein subunit vaccines are already used for other vaccine preventable diseases, such as the Hepatitis B vaccine. |Eligibility for the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine| | | The mRNA vaccines remain the recommended vaccine to offer to eligible individuals. Individuals receive the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine if they Please see | | How can I get the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine? | | You cannot book through the provincial portal. Booking will be through your local public health unit. Use |Common side effects of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine| | | It is common to have temporary side effects after getting vaccinated. At the injection site: General symptoms: |What information is there regarding Myocarditis and or pericarditis following vaccination?| | | The clinical trial data shows that there have been mild cases of myocarditis and or pericarditis reported after receiving the Novavax Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccine. According to the For more information see | | Please see the According to NACI, the safety and efficacy of Novavax Nuvaxovid have not been established in the following populations: Informed consent should include discussion that there is currently limited evidence on the use of the Novavax Nuvaxovid in these populations, while there is evidence on the safety profile and effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in these populations based on real world use with large numbers of individuals. NACI will continue to monitor the evidence and update recommendations as needed. | | Are there any contraindications or special precautions for the Novavax vaccine? | | At the time of approval, there are no known serious warnings or precautions associated with the Novavax Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccine. Allergy to ingredients in a vaccine or its container is considered a contraindication. A potential allergen found in the Novavax vaccine is polysorbate 80. This is found in several medical preparations like vitamin oils, tablets, anticancer agents, and also in cosmetic products. For a full list of ingredients please see Vaccines received outside of Canada, Ontario or Ottawa, or through a Federal program |I have received one or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine while in a different province or country.

If your submission is not approved, you will receive an email from Ottawa Public Health with further instructions to re-submit with corrections and/or omissions. Pregnancy and COVID-19 Vaccines |I am pregnant. Should I get the COVID-19 Vaccine?| | | COVID-19 vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (including booster doses) is strongly recommended during pregnancy. Getting vaccinated, as soon as possible, is the safest choice to protect yourself and your baby from the known risks of COVID-19 infection. Several studies have shown that receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccines right before and/or at any stage of pregnancy has no impact on pregnancy outcomes. |What are the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination for you and your baby?| | | Getting the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine helps prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and complications from COVID-19 infection. |What are the side effects of receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine?| | | Pregnant and breastfeeding individuals who receive the mRNA (Comirnaty/Pfizer-BioNtech or Moderna) vaccines experience the same side effects of vaccination as non-pregnant individuals. |What if I am planning a pregnancy?| | | There is no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines have any effect on your fertility or chances of becoming pregnant. Fertility treatment is not a medical reason that prevents you from getting vaccinated. Safety |I am concerned about reports of myocarditis or pericarditis following the COVID-19 vaccine. What information is there?| | | Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle. Pericarditis is an inflammation of the lining around the heart. Symptoms can include: There have been reports of myocarditis and/or pericarditis after immunization with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in Canada and internationally. Cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis occur more often in people under 30 years of age, more often in males than in females, and more often after a second dose of an mRNA vaccine than after a first or booster dose. The risk of myocarditis/ pericarditis is rare, and events usually occur within a week after vaccination and mostly have been mild with a quick recovery. According to the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI): For people aged 5 to 29 years receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine primary series: NACI further states that the known risks of COVID-19 illness (including complications like myocarditis/pericarditis) outweigh the potential harms of having an adverse reaction following mRNA vaccination, including the rare risk of myocarditis or pericarditis which despite hospitalization, is relatively mild and resolves quickly in most individuals. People aged 30 years or older can receive either mRNA vaccines (Comirnaty/Pfizer-BioNtech or Moderna) to start or continue the mRNA vaccine primary series given that this age group has a lower risk of vaccine-associated myocarditis/pericarditis. People 18 years of age and older can receive a booster dose with any available mRNA COVID-19 vaccine as to date, there has not been a difference between Pfizer and Moderna in terms of the risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis following booster doses. The majority of reported cases have been mild with individuals recovering quickly, normally with anti-inflammatory medication. Get medical attention immediately if you develop any of the following symptoms: | | Can getting a COVID-19 vaccine affect menstruation or fertility? | | It is not clear if the COVID-19 vaccine can affect your periods. But getting sick with COVID-19 can affect your periods. Studies looking at whether there is a link between menstrual cycles and the COVID-19 vaccine are underway. As per the Fertility, the ability to get pregnant, is not affected by vaccines. During the years that someone could get pregnant, precaution should be taken with certain live virus vaccines. This is because of theoretical risk to the fetus, not because fertility could be affected. An example of a live virus vaccine is the measles vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccines in use are not live virus vaccines. There is no biological reason to believe that the current COVID-19 vaccines would impact someone's fertility. The U.S. has safety data of over 35,000 pregnant women who received COVID-19 vaccine. This data has not identified any safety concerns with getting an mRNA vaccine within 30 days of conception. NACI has recommended that you do not need to avoid pregnancy after vaccination with an mRNA vaccine. An individual may receive all doses for which they are eligible during the course of a pregnancy. Male fertility: millions of men worldwide have received the COVID-19 vaccines. There is no evidence to date that shows that getting a COVID-19 vaccine could lead to fertility loss. We do know that all vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccines, can cause a brief fever in some people. Significant fever from any cause (e.g., if you get the flu) may have a temporary impact on sperm count and quality. But, this effect is only temporary. Some studies have shown that if you get COVID-19, it may affect the quality of your sperm. It is unclear how long this effect lasts. | | | | If you or someone you are supporting has a needle fear, phobia or anxiety, community clinic staff can support.

Most people with COVID-19 get better in a few weeks. Some take longer to recover or have problems during recovery. Anyone can experience post-COVID-19 health conditions (also referred to as long COVID, long-haul COVID, post-acute COVID-19, long-term effects of COVID, or chronic COVID). This includes people who did not have symptoms while they had COVID-19. Every person is different. Preventing post-COVID conditions / 'long-COVID': According to the Symptoms of post-COVID-19 health conditions can be new or ongoing and last weeks or months following a COVID-19 infection. Some of these symptoms can include: Post-COVID-19 health conditions appear to be less common in children and adolescents. Symptoms in children and adolescents are similar to those experienced by adults. The causes and treatments for each person who has longer-term health problems will be different. The long-term effects of COVID-19 infection are still being studied. Have a discussion with your health care provider about your personal situation if you are having problems during your recovery. For more information on post-COVID-19 health conditions, please visit: | | How can I reduce the risks of COVID-19 transmission in indoor spaces? | | Exhaled breath, whether from breathing, speaking, singing, shouting, etc., contains a variety of sizes of particles - respiratory droplets or aerosols - some of which are big enough that they fall quickly to the ground. Some of which are small enough that they can stay in the air for various lengths of time. COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through direct contact into the mouth, nose, or eyes with the exhaled respiratory droplets or aerosols which carry the virus from an infected person. Ventilation indoors with fresh air provides an important additional layer of protection. Ventilation with fresh air should be improved whenever possible, e.g., bringing in more fresh air through a properly maintained ventilation system or by opening windows and doors. Reducing the risk of transmission while indoors by wearing a mask or face covering and ensuring a distance of two metres (six feet) from those outside your household, continue to be important basics. Poor ventilation in indoor spaces is linked to increased transmission of respiratory infections, particularly if the space is small. Transmission of COVID-19 has been linked with enclosed spaces, including from people who are infected but are not showing any symptoms of illness. Even when keeping a distance of two or more metres, people should wear a mask if spending time in an enclosed airspace with people not from their household. The longer you are exposed to someone else in an enclosed space, the higher your chances are of breathing in that person's exhaled respiratory droplets. The safest approach is to wear a mask at all times when you are in the same room with someone not from your household. |How do heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems affect the transmission of COVID-19?| | | A well-maintained HVAC system may help reduce transmission of COVID-19 by exchanging indoor air, into which people have exhaled, with fresh outdoor air and by filtering recirculated air. Because of mechanical and structural complexity and cost, improved ventilation may need to be a longer-term goal, though adjustments to maximize air exchanges and filtration efficiency within the specifications of the existing HVAC system should be made as soon as possible. If possible, consult an HVAC professional to determine: There are also quicker added interventions, such as portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration units but purchase and operating costs must be considered. Note, however, that within a single room, the air blown around by air conditioners or fans may increase the distance over which a virus can be transmitted. To help prevent blowing air from areas in which there may be virus into other areas and to reduce the concentration of virus particles in these areas: Please note that air conditioners and fans also require regular maintenance, such as: Please note: Ventilation must never be considered the main or only means of risk reduction: masking, distancing, barriers, and hand hygiene have more immediate and reliable results. Allergies, side effects and precautions |Can people with severe allergies to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine receive the vaccine?| | | As per the Ministry of Health COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance, people with known allergies to components of the COVID-19 vaccine may speak with a physician or nurse practitioner to determine whether and how they should receive a COVID-19 vaccine. The physician or nurse practitioner can help create a vaccination care plan to ensure you receive the vaccine safely. If you have a known severe allergic reaction to a component in one of either the Moderna Spikevax or Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNtech) vaccines and can't interchange your subsequent dose, you will be able to receive the appropriate vaccine at one of our clinics. Visit the | |[American Sign Language - What are the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines?](/en/public-health-topics/covid-19-resources-in-american-sign-language.aspx#sideeffects) The most frequent side effects are injection site pain, fatigue and headache. Some people who got the vaccine in trials also reported muscle pain, chills, joint pain and fever. These symptoms were usually mild or moderate and went away within a few days. These are all expected reactions to vaccines because of the immune response. They are very similar to those reported following the seasonal influenza vaccination. You can find more information on the side effects for each vaccine on the [Health Canada website](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines.html). If someone experiences an adverse event following immunization, they should report it to a healthcare professional (e.g., family doctor). An adverse event following immunization (AEFI) is an unwanted or unexpected health effect that happens after someone receives a vaccine, which may or may not be caused by the vaccine. Public health surveillance of AEFIs is important for timely detection of rare vaccine safety issues. For more information visit the [OPH page on AEFI reporting](/en/professionals-and-partners/influenza-vaccine-information-for-health-professionals.aspx#Report-of-adverse-events-following-immunization-AEFI). Expected side effects for each vaccine product are listed on the vaccine product monograph; common side effects could be found under 'Side effects and risks'. Healthcare professionals should complete the [Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/A/2020/aefi-reporting-form.pdf?la=en) Form and send it to the local public health unit. New Online Reporting Option for AEFIs We are pleased to announce an online portal for submitting AEFI reporting securely in PDF format: [https://secureforms.ottawapublichealth.ca/vaccines/AEFI-Submission-EN](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecureforms.ottawapublichealth.ca%2Fvaccines%2FAEFI-Submission-EN&data=04%7C01%7CAndres.Acero%40ottawa.ca%7C859a7ef0eba34b594a5508d9af88933f%7Cdfcc033ddf874c6ea1b88eaa73f1b72e%7C0%7C0%7C637733823377909254%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=nD82yhg%2BA%2BjH7f594ALfEI5sdHMuWFOd6YnY%2BrDAkeU%3D&reserved=0) This provides another option, in addition to reporting by fax to: 613-580-9660. Can I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I recently got another vaccine or if I am due for another vaccine? NACI [recommends](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/recommendations-use-covid-19-vaccines/summary-updates-september-28-2021.html) that COVID-19 vaccines may be given at the same time as, or before or after other vaccines for anyone 6 months of age or older. This includes live, non-live, adjuvanted, and non-adjuvanted vaccines. There are no specific safety concerns when routine vaccines are given at the same time or within days of each other. Please note that there could be stronger, temporary side effects when a COVID-19 vaccine and another vaccine are given at the same time or within days of each other.
