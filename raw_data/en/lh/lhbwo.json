Grantee's failure to maintain or submit evidence of insurance coverage, as required, is a material breach of this Contract. If Grantee loses insurance coverage, fails to renew coverage, or for any reason becomes uninsured during the Term, Grantee shall immediately notify the State. All insurance companies providing coverage must be: (a) acceptable to the State; (b) authorized by the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance (\"TDCI\"); and (c) rated A- / VII or better by A.M.

If the deficient underlying policy is for a coverage area without aggregate limits (generally Automobile Liability and Employers' Liability Accident), Grantee shall provide a copy of the umbrella insurance policy documents to ensure that no aggregate limit applies to the umbrella policy for that coverage area.

At any time, the State may require Grantee to provide a valid COI. The Parties agree that failure to provide evidence of insurance coverage as required is a material breach of this Contract. If Grantee self-insures, then a COI will not be required to prove coverage. Instead Grantee shall provide a certificate of self-insurance or a letter, on Grantee's letterhead, detailing its coverage, policy amounts, and proof of funds to reasonably cover such expenses.
