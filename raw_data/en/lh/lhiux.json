Vaccines have saved countless lives and improved the health of people all over the world. Sartorius technology supports the production of traditional vaccines and emerging technologies such as recombinant vaccines. This is helping the industry to address both global endemic diseases and less predictable, but potentially devastating, localized outbreaks. More than ever, people around the world need access to vaccines produced to rigorous standards of quality but at low cost. Flexible production facilities are needed that will allow capacity to be modulated easily. Increasingly vaccine manufacturers are seeking to construct and operate these facilities in locations across the globe to shorten delivery times and cold chain supply networks. Vaccine Development for SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus Causing COVID-19 Pandemic Solutions to Fight the Coronavirus Outbreak The current Coronavirus outbreak is creating serious health and economic impact in the entire world as it spreads at unprecedented speed. Many private and public companies, and funding organizations are putting a significant amount of effort to develop a vaccine that could stop the spreading of the virus, thus saving thousands of lives. In such times speed is of essence and vaccine manufacturers will be looking for agile and responsive partners like Sartorius.
