Practice -Based Learning, October Amended: August 15, 201 9 AANMC | 1717 K Street NW, Suite 900, Washington D.C. 20006 | www.AANMC.org 3 The purpose of the document is to describe the required core competencies of a graduate from an accredited naturopathic doctoral program in order to align curriculum, define expectations of graduates, and inform stakeholders regarding the education of physicians/doctors who practice naturopathic medicine. The expectation is that this document will se rve to guide current and future programs of naturopathic medical education. Introduction Naturopathic Medicine is a distinct primary health care profession that combines the traditions of natural healing with the rigors of modern science. Naturopathic physicians/doctors (NDs) are trained as primary care providers who diagnose, treat and manage patients w ho have acute and chronic conditions, while addressing disease and dysfunction at the levels of body, mind and spirit. NDs concentrate on w hole patient wellness through health promotion and disease prevention, attempting to find the underlying cause of the patient's condition. NDs care for patients of all ages and genders. They provide individualized , evidence -informed therapies , applying the least harmful and most effective approaches to help facilitate the body's inherent ability to restore and maintain optimal health. A resurgence of interest in naturopathic medicine in North America in the 1970s resulted in rapid growth and maturation of the naturopathic profession to where it is today. As of 2019 , there are seven accredited institutions of higher learning offering naturopathic degrees across North America. The Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME) is the accredit ing body for these programs. Graduates of CNME accredited naturopathic medical programs receive a Naturopathic Doctoral designation (ND) and are eligible to take the entry to practice examination . The Association of Accredited Naturopathic Medical Colleges (AANMC) and its Council of Chief Academic and Clinical Officers (CCACO), recognized the need for agreement among the AANMC member schools on clinical expectations for graduates of CNME -accredited naturopathic medical programs. As such, CCACO and AANMC em barked on examination of current clinical expectations and the creation of a unified baseline for clinical competenc e of the naturopathic medical graduate. In August of 2012, CCACO agreed to embark on the creation of naturopathic clinical competencies for the accredited institutions. In July 2013, academic and clinical deans from each CNME accredited institution developed a draft document, after which time CCACO convened a taskforce of representatives from the accredited naturopathic medical programs and the executive director of the AANMC. This subgroup met regularly for six months, and received input from CCACO, stakeholders and advisors in the broader medical and educational communities to create the first draft of the naturopathic clinical competency document. The document then received input from the naturopathic community and final approval from CCACO and the AANMC Board of Directors. The process for review and revision of the Competencies was initiated in 2018. The following report constitutes cons ensus among AANMC members on the clinical competencies for the naturopathic medical graduate. AANMC | 1717 K Street NW, Suite 900, Washington D.C. 20006 | www.AANMC.org 4 Core Principles The practice of naturopathic medicine is guided by six core principles .1 First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere): The ND follows three guidelines to avoid harming the patient: Uses methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects; Uses the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; avoid when possible the harmful suppression of symptoms; and Acknowledges, respects, and works with individuals' self -healing process. The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae): The ND recognizes an inherent self -healing process in people that is ordered and intelligent. The ND acts to identif y and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment this inherent self -healing process. Identify and Treat the Causes (ToIle Causam): The ND seeks to identify and remove the underlying cause(s) of illness rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. Doctor as Teacher (Docere): The ND educates patients and encourages self -responsibility for health. The ND also recognizes and employs the therapeutic potential of the doctor -patient relationship. Treat the Whole Per son: The ND treats each patient by taking into account individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, the ND encourages individuals to pursue their personal spir itual development. Prevention : The ND emphasizes the prevention of disease by assessing risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease, and by making appropriate interventions in partnership with the patient to prevent illness. The Seven Areas of Competence for the Naturopathic Medica l Graduate: Medical Assessment and Diagnosis Patient Management Communication and Collaboration Professionalism Career Development and Practice Management System -based Practice Practice -based Learning, Research and Scholarship 1 The core principles are d efined by American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) and endorsed by the Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors (CAND).
