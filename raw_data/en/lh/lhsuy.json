Ayurveda is the ancient tradition of natural medicine developed in India for the benefit of humanity. | | Ayurveda is the ancient science of life, revealed by the Sages of India. From the deepest knowledge of the nature of the body, mind, soul, and nature, recommendations were given for health, happiness, and spiritual realization. Ayurveda is a holistic system which heals body, mind, and soul. It spiritual remedies are used to treat all sorts of conditions including the root cause of disease: prajna paradha, or \"the disconnection from knowledge\" for the individual soul of its true divine nature. The attentive practice of an Ayurvedic lifestyle not only provides the tools for healing the body and mind, but also frees the soul from the bonds of the world and uplifts it to its highest divine potential. | | This is a brief documentary about Swamiji's work with Ayurveda filmed by Ian Mabley. | | Our Ayurvedic Botanical Garden We maintain a collection of Ayurvedic herbs and native Appalachian and European medicinal herbs.
