The naturopathic doctor treats the whole person by taking all of these factors into account, not seeing them as simply related to a single organ or body part. All parts are interrelated and must be seen as such for true healing to be possible. Naturopathic medicine is a complete system of medicine based on drug-free approaches including herbal medicine, homeopathy, natural anti-microbials, hormone balancing therapies, vitamin/ mineral therapy, amino acid therapy, detoxification and energetic medicine. This natural approach allows for profound healing of the body and return of health and balance, without the invasiveness and potential side effects of drug therapy and surgery. It also allows for the prevention of chronic disease through the application of good nutrition, exercise and other health regimens. Over and above the tools that naturopathic doctors use, what really sets naturopathic medicine apart is its philosophy. Naturopathic medicine seeks to find the underlying cause of disease, not seeking to simply mask symptoms. Herbs and other \"natural\" remedies can also be used to suppress or mask symptoms just as well as drugs (and often are to give relief while underlying issues are addressed), but this is not in keeping with the naturopathic philosophy, which is to find the root cause and address that, so that symptoms naturally resolve on their own. Naturopathic medicine is founded on the healing power of nature, which means that the body will correct itself, rebalance itself - in medical terms, return to homeostasis - if the obstacles to healing are removed. So often the role of the naturopathic doctor is to identify and remove those obstacles. Naturopathic doctors engage the patients as partners in their own care, and adopt a team approach. They educate their patients in their health concerns and encourage them to take responsibility for their healing path. Naturopathic doctors have comprehensive training in medical sciences, including western medicine and pharmacology. In many states, naturopathic doctors prescribe hormones and medications. Hence naturopathic medicine combines the latest in medical science with age-old traditions of healing, giving every patient the best success in restoration of health, and prevention of illness thereby achieving optimal health goals.
