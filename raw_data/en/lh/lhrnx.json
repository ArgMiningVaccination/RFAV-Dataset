As Raghudas has taught us, Thus, we honor one spirit through multiple world wisdom traditions, one heart in a diversity of individual expression and one consciousness in Earth and her varied life forms. We practice simplicity by living humbly and sustainably upon our Mother Earth and express our love as a healing community rooted in the teachings of Ayurveda. Recognizing that health of the individual and the family rests upon the health of the Earth, we are devoted to earth-healing practices centered upon the five sacred elements: earth, water, fire, air and space. We seek to sustain nature in all our daily choices, including housing, food production, transportation, healthcare and energy use. Meeting our needs with simplicity and making our offerings of spiritual practices and Ayurveda accessible to all, we reach out to nourish those who are socially disenfranchised or economically disadvantaged. In the spirit of connectedness, we welcome seekers of all walks of life into our family of the heart. "}
