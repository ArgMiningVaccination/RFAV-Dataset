Type of Change by Detailed Occupation, 2018 SOC .................................................... 265 Introduction The 2018 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system is used by federal statistical agencies to classify workers and jobs into occupational categories for the purpose of collecting, calculating, analyzing, or disseminating data. User s of occupational data include government program managers, industrial and labor relations practitioners, students considering career training, jobseekers, career and employment counselors, educational institutions, and employers wishing to set salary scales or to locate to a new facility. Federal agencies use the SOC system to collect occupational data. The implementation of the 2000 SOC meant that for the first time, all major occupational data sources produced by the f ederal statistical system provid ed data that are comparable, greatly improving the usefulness of the data. The 2018 SOC continues to serve this purpose and has been revised to improve data collection and reflect the current occupational structure of the United States . The SO C classifies all occupations in which work is performed for pay or profit. The SOC covers all jobs in the national economy, including occupations in the public, private, and military sectors. All f ederal agencies that publish occupational data for statistical purposes are required to use the SOC to increase data comparability across federal programs. State and local government agencies are strongly encouraged to use this national system to promote a common language for categorizing and analyzing occupations. To faci litate classification and presentation of data, t he SOC is organized into a tiered system with four levels, ranging from major groups to detailed occupations. As in the 2000 and 2010 SOC, the 2018 SOC contains 23 major groups which are broken into min or groups. In the 2018 SOC there are 98 minor groups. Each minor group is broken into broad occupations , of which there are 459. There are, at the highest level of specifi cation , 867 detailed occupations. Detailed occupations with similar job duties, and i n some cases, similar skills, education, and/or training , are grouped together in the SOC . Each worker is cla ssified into only one of the 867 detailed occupations based on the tasks he or she performs. Overview of SOC Manual 2018 The SO C Manual 2018 is available in electronic format only. This Introduction describes the history of the SOC, the revision process, and coding structure. It also provides answers to frequently asked questions. The full 2018 SOC system showing the different levels of aggregation, a s well as the occupation titles, definitions , and illustrative examples, is available from https://bls.gov/soc/2018/major_groups.htm. Other downloadable materials related to the 2018 SOC can be found on the SOC website at https://www.bls.gov/soc. 1Historical background The Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) manual was first published in 1980, but was rarely used. The Office of Management and Budget ( OMB) created the SOC Revision Policy Committee (SOCRPC) to revise the SOC for 2000 , with the purpose of creating a system of classification that would allow all government agencies and private industry to produce comparable data. Com pleted in 1998, the 2000 SOC resulted from 4 years of research by the SOC RPC and workgroups composed of members of more than 15 government agencies. The SOCRPC used the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS) Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) occupational classificatio n system as the starting point for the new SOC framework. Begi nning in 2006, OMB published notices in the Federal Register to solicit public comment, questions, and suggestions for the 2010 SOC. Based on these comments, the Standard Occupational Classification Policy Committee (SOCPC) formulated recommendations to OMB. Working with the SOCPC, OMB made its final decisions on the 2010 SOC, published these decisions in the Federal Register in January 2009, and then published final definitions for all detailed 2010 SOC occupations in the SOC Manual 2010. The SO C Manual 2018 replaces the 2010 editi on, and will be adopted by all f ederal agencies that use the SOC Manual 2010. Revi sion p rocess for the 2018 e dition OMB first met in 2013 with the SOCPC, which includes representatives from the following agencies: oDepa rtment of Labor , Bureau of Labor Statistics oDepartment of Labor, Employment and Training Administration oDepartment of Commerce, Census Bureau oDepartment of Defense, Defense Manpower Data Center oDepartment of Education, National Center for Education Statistics oDepartment of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics oEqual Employment Opportunity Commission oDepartment of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and ServicesAdministration oNational Science Foundation, National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics oOffice of Personnel Management oOffice of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs To in itiate the formal 2018 SOC revision process, OMB and the SOCPC requested public comment in a May 22, 2014, Federal Register notice ( 79 FR 29620-29624) on: othe proposed revision to the 2010 SOC Classification Principles othe intention to retain the 2010 SOC Coding Guidelines 2othe intention to retain the 2010 SOC Major Group structure oproposals for the correction, change, or combination of 2010 SOC detailed occupations oinclusion of new detailed occupations The comment period for the May 22, 2014, notice closed on July 21, 2014. To ca rry out the bulk of the revision effort, the SOCPC created eight workgroups composed of agency staff to examine occupations in the following major groups: Mana gement; Business and Financial Operations; and Legal Occupations (codes 11- 0000, 13-0000, and 23-0000) Computer and Mathematical; Architecture and Engineering; and Life, Physical, and Social Science Occupations (codes 15 -0000 through 19-0000) Community and Social Service; Healthcare Practitioners and Technical; and Healthcare Support Occupations (codes 21-0000, 29-0000, and 31-0000) Education, Training, and Library; and Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media Occupations (codes 25- 0000 through 27-0000) Protective Service; Food Preparation and Serving Related; Building and GroundsCleaning and Maintenance; Personal Care and Service; Sales and Related; and Office and Administrative Support Occupations (codes 33-0000 through 43-0000) Farming, Fishing, and Forestry; Construction and Extraction; Installation, Maintenance, and Repair; and Transportation and Material Moving Occupations (codes 45-0000 through 49-0000 and 53-0000) Production Occupations (code 51-0000) Military Specific Occupations (code 55-0000) The w orkgroups were charged with reviewing comments received in response to the May 22, 2014, Federal Register notice and providing recommendations to the SOCPC. Guided by the Classifica tion P rinciples , the SOCPC reviewed the recommendations from the workgroups and reached decisions by consensus. OMB announced the proposed new structure in a Federal Register no t ice on July 22, 2016, ( 81 FR 48306-4 8310). OMB, in conjunction with the SOCPC, reviewed and carefully considere d the comments received in response to this notice in the process of making its final decisions. The final 2018 occupation changes were announced i n a Federal Register notice on November 28, 2017 (82 F R 56271-56273). Future of the SOC The SOCPC will continue to serve as a standing committee after electronic publication of the SOC Manual 2018, in order to perform maintenance functions such as recommending clarifications of SOC definitions, place new occupations within the existing structure, and update title files , including the Direct Match Title File . Deve loped for the 2010 SOC, the Direct Match Title File lists associated job titles for almost all detailed SOC occupations. Each of t hese titles direct ly matches to a single SOC detailed 3occupation (i.e. one- to-one mappings, where all workers with the job title listed in the Direct Match Title File are classified into exactly one detailed SOC occupation code). All f ederal agencies that use the SOC will adopt the Direct Match Title File, although some may maintain separate program- specific title files. The Direct Match Title File allow s data users to compare occupational infor mation for these titles across f ederal statistical agencies. The S OCPC will continue to update the Direct M atch Title File on a regular basis. Interested parties may suggest additional job titles to the SOCPC by emailing SOC@bls.gov. Instructions for submitting your recommendation, and other files related to the Direct Match T itle File, are available at https://www.bls.gov/soc . 4What's n ew in the 2018 SOC In c omparison w ith the 2010 S O C, t he 2018 SO C had a net gain of 27 detailed occupati ons and 1 minor gr oup. T he ne t number of br oad occupatio ns fell by 2 and t he num ber of maj or gr oups remained unchanged. Th e 2018 S OC system cont ains 867 de tailed occupations, aggregated into 459 broad occupations. In turn, the SOC combines these 459 broad occupations into 98 minor groups and 23 major groups. Of the 867 occupations in the 2018 structure, 382 remained completely unchanged from the 2010 SOC, 356 had at least a definition change, 131 had at least a title change, and 115 had at least a code change. Most of the definition changes (254) were edi torial revisi ons o r clarificati ons tha t did not change occupationa l content. Therefore, no substanti ve change oc curred f or about 88 percent of the de tailed occupati ons i n the 2010 SOC. Occupationa l areas with significant r evisions and addi tions i ncluded oInform ation technology (minor group 15-1200 Computer Occupations) and oHealthcare (major groups 29- 0000 Healthcare Practitioners and Technical Occupations and 31-0000 Healthcare Support Occupations) The s eve n detailed occupations in Table 1 moved from one major group in the 2010 SOC to a different major group in 2018 and received new 2018 SOC codes as a result. Table 1. Detailed occupations that moved from one major group to another 2018 SOC code 2018 SOC Title 19-5011 Occupational Health and Safety Specialists 19-5012 Occupational Health and Safety Technicians 27-3092 Court Reporters and Simultaneous Captioners 31-1122 Personal Care Aides 47-5022 Excavating and Loading Machine and Dragline Operators, Surface Mining 47-5044 Loading and Moving Machine Operators, Underground Mining 53-7065 Stockers and Order Fillers The mi nor group \"Occupational Health and Safety Specialists and Technicians\" (19-5000) moved into major group \"Life, Physical and Social Science Occupations\" (19 -0000) from its former location as a broad occupation, \"Occupational Health and Safety Specialists and Technicians\" (29 -9010 in the 2010 SOC) in the major group \"Healthcare Practitioners and Technical Occupations\" (29 -0000). Four detailed occupations moved across minor groups: \"Teaching Assistants, Postsecondary \" (25-9044, \" (29- 1292, formerly 29-2021), \" Computer Numerically Controlled Tool Operators \" (51-9161, formerly 51-4011), and Computer Numerically Controlled Tool Programmers (51-9162, formerly 51-4012). 5The major group level title for \"Education, Training, and Library Occupations\" (25-0000) changed to \"Educational Instruction and Library Occupations\" to clarify that not all per sonnel at education institutions should be placed in major group 25-0000 (e.g. school principals are in major group 11-0000), and that other types of instructors, such as flight instructors (who are included in \"Aircraft Pilots and Flight Engineers\" (53-2010) and corporate trainers (who are included in \"Training and Development Specialists\" (13-1151), exist outside of major group 25-0000. The m inor group code for \"Computer Occupations\" (15-1200, formerly 15-1100) was changed to highlight the impact of the many changes made to the detailed occupations within that group on time series analysis. The minor group code and title, as well as the broad occupations included, changed with the creation of \"Home Health and Personal Care Aides; and Nursing Assistants, Orderlies, and Psychiatric Aides\" (31 -1100, formerly 31-1000), which \"Personal Care Aides\" (31 -1122, formerly 39-9021). Seve nty detailed occupations are new to the 2018 SOC. The 32 detailed occupations in Table 2 resulted from splitting existing detailed 2010 SOC occupations into more than one detailed 2018 SOC occupation. Table 2.

Other occupations that resulted from combining existing 2010 detailed occupations are shown in Table 4. Table 4.

A complete list of the codes deleted from the 2010 SOC is available at: https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/home.htm . 8Classification p rinciples The SOC Classification P rinciples form the basis on which the SOC system is structured. 1. The S OC covers all occupations in which work is performed for pay or profit, including work performed in family-operated enterprises by family members who are not directly compensated. It excludes occupations unique to volunteers. Each occupation is assigned toonly one occupational category at the most detailed level of the classification. 2.Occup ations are classified based on work performed and, in some cases, on the skills, education and/or training needed to perform the work. 3. Worke rs primarily engaged in planning and the directing of resources are classified in management occupations in Major Group 11-0000. Duties of these workers may includesupervision. 4. Super visors of workers in Major Groups 13-0000 through 29-0000 usually have work experience and perform activities similar to those of the workers they supervise, andtherefore are classified with the workers they supervise. 5. Worke rs in Major Group 31-0000 Healthcare Support Occupations assist and are usually supervised by workers in Major Group 29-0000 Healthcare Practitioners and Technical Occupations, and t herefore there are no first -line supervisor occupations in Major Group 31-0000. 6. Worke rs in Major Groups 33-0000 through 53-0000 whose primary duty is supervising are classified in the appropriate first- line supervisor category because their work activities are distinct from those of the workers they supervise. 7.Appre ntices and traine es are classified with the occupations for which they are being trained, while helpers and aides are classified separately because they are not in training for the occupation they are helping. 8. If a n occupation is not included as a distinct detailed occupation in the structure, it is classified in an appropriate ''All Other\" occupation. ''All Other'' occupations are placed inthe structure when it is determined that the detailed occupations comprising a broadoccupation group do not account for all of the workers in the group, even though suchworkers may perform a distinct set of work activities. These occupations appear as the lastoccupation in the group with a code ending in ''9'' and are identified in their title byhaving ''All Other'' appear at the e nd. 9.The U .S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau are charged with collecting and reporting data on total U.S. employment across the full spectrum of SOCMajor Groups. Thus, for a detailed occupation to be included in the SOC, either the Bureauof Labor Statistics or the Census Bureau must be able to collect and report data on thatoccupation. 10.To maximize the comparability of data, time series continuity is maintained to the extent possible. 9Coding guidelines The following SOC coding guidelines are intended to assist users in consistently assigning SOC codes and titles to survey responses and in other coding activities. 1. A wor ker should be assigned to an SOC occupation code based on work performed. 2. When w orkers in a single job could be coded in more than one occupation, they should be coded in the occupation that requires the highest level of skill. If there is no measurable difference in skill requirements, workers should be coded in the occupation in which they spend the most time. Workers whose job is to teach at different levels (e.g., elementary,middle, or secondary) should be coded in the occupation corresponding to the highes t educational level they teach. 3. Dat a collection and reporting agencies should assign workers to the most detailed occupation possible. Different agencies may use different levels of aggregation, depending on their ability to collect data . 4.Work ers who perform activities not described in any distinct detailed occupation in the SOC structure should be coded in an appropriate ''All Other'' occupation. These occupations appear as the last occupation in a group with a code ending in ''9'' and areidentified by having the words ''All Other'' appear at the end of the title. 5. Workers in Major Groups 33-0000 through 53-0000 who spend 80 percent or more of their time performing supervisory activities are coded in the appropriate first-line supervis or category in the SOC. In these same Major Groups (33 -0000 through 53- 0000), persons with supervisory duties who spend less than 80 percent of their time supervising are coded with the workers they supervise . 6. Lic ensed and non- licensed workers performing the same work should be coded together in the same detailed occupation, except where specified otherwise in the SOC definition. 10SOC c oding structure The occupations in the SOC are classified at four levels of aggregation to suit the needs of various data users: major group, minor group, broad occupation, and detailed occupation. Each lower level of detail identifies a more specific group of occupations. The 23 major groups , listed below, are divided into 98 minor groups, 459 broad occupations, and 867 detailed occupations. 2018 SOC major g roups Code Title 11-0000 Management Occupations 13-0000 Business and Financial Operations Occupations 15-0000 Computer and Mathematical Occupations 17-0000 Architecture and Engineering Occupations 19-0000 Life, Physical, and Social Science Occupations 21-0000 Community and Social Service Occupations 23-0000 Legal Occupations 25-0000 Educational Instruction and Library Occupations 27-0000 Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media Occupations 29-0000 Healthcare Practitioners and Technical Occupations 31-0000 Healthcare Support Occupations 33-0000 Protective Service Occupations 35-0000 Food Preparation and Serving Related Occupations 37-0000 Building and Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance Occupations 39-0000 Personal Care and Service Occupations 41-0000 Sales and Related Occupations 43-0000 Office and Administrative Support Occupations 45-0000 Farming, Fishing, and Forestry Occupations 47-0000 Cons truction and Extraction Occupations 49-0000 Installation, Maintenance, and Repair Occupations 51-0000 Production Occupations 53-0000 Transportation and Material Moving Occupations 55-0000 Military Specific Occupations Some users may require aggregations other than the SOC system built on these m ajor groups. Further details on alternate occupational aggregations and approved modifications to the SOC structure are provided in the following section, Approved modifications to the structure . Major groups are broken into minor groups, which, in turn, are divided into broad occupations. Broad occupations are then divided into one or more detailed occupations, as follows: 29-0000 Healthcare Practitioner s and Technical Occupations 29-1000 Health Diagnosing or Treating Practitioners 29-102 0 Dentists 29 -1022 Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons 11o Major group codes end with 0000 (e.g., 29-0000 Healthcare Practitioners and Technical Occupations). o Minor groups generally end with 000 (e.g., 29-1000 Health Diagnosing or Treating Practitioners )\u2014the exceptions are minor groups 15-1200 Computer Occupations, 31- 1100 Home Health and Personal Care Aides; and Nursing Assistants, Orderlies, and Psychiatric Ai des, and 51-5100 Printing Workers, which end with 00. o Broad occupations end with 0 (e.g., 29 -1020 Dentists ). o Detailed occupations end with a number other than 0 (e.g., 29-1022 Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons ). Each item in the SOC is designated by a six -digit code. The hyphen between the second and third digit is used only for clarity . (See figure 1). Figure 1. As shown in figure 2, \"All Other\" occupations ( and \"Other \" or \" Miscellaneous\" occupations), whether at the detailed or broad occupation or minor group level, contain a \"9\" at the level of the \"All Other\" occupation . Minor groups that are major group \"All Other\" occupations end in 9000 (e.g., 33-9000, Other Protective Service Worker s). Broad occupations that are minor group \"All Other\" occupations end in 90 (e.g., 33-9090, Miscellaneous Protective Service Workers). Detailed \"All Other\" occupations end in 9 (e.g., 33-9099, Protective Service Workers, All Other). 12Figure 2. If there are more than nine broad occupations in a minor group (e.g., 51-9000 Other Production Occupations); or more than eight, if there is no \"All Other\" occupation (e.g., 47-2000 Construction Trades Workers), then the code xx-x090 is skipped (reserved for \"All Other\" occupations), the code xx-x000 is skipped (reserved for minor groups), and the numbering system will continue with code xx-x110. The \"All Other\" broad occupation is then code xx-x190 or xx-x290 (e.g., 51-9190, Miscellaneous Production Workers). The structure is comprehensive, and encompasses all occupations in the U.S. economy. If a specific occupation is not listed, it is included in an \"All Other\" category with similar occupations. Detailed occupations are identified and defined so that each occupation includes workers who perform similar job tasks as described in C lassification P rinciple 2 . Definitions begin with the duties that all workers in the occupation perform. Some definitions include a sentence at the end descr ibing tasks workers in an occupation may , but do not necessarily have to perform, in order to be included in the occupation. Where the definitions include tasks also performed by workers in another occupation, cross- references to that occupation are provid ed in the definition. Figure 3 identifies the eight elements that appear in detailed SOC occupations. All six -digit detailed occupations have a (1) SOC code , (2) title, and (3) definition. All workers classified in an occupation are required to perform the duties described in (4) the first sentence (s) of each definition that do not start with \"May.\" Some definitions also have a (5) \"May\" statement, a (6) \"Includes\" statement, and/ or a (7) \"E xcludes\" statement. Almost all occupations have one or more (8) \"I llustrative E xamples.\" Illustrative examples are job titles classified in only that occupation, and were selected from the Direct Match Title File . 13Figure 3 . The \"May\" statements describe tasks that workers in that occupation may\u2014but are not required to \u2014 perform in order to be classified with Survey Researchers. The \" Includes\" statement identifies particular workers who should be classified with Survey Researchers. The \" Excludes\" statement indicates other detailed occupations that may be similar to Survey Researchers and clarifies that workers who fall into those occupations should be excluded from Survey Researchers. 14Approved modifications to the structure Agencies may use the SOC or parts of the SOC at varying levels of the system . For example, data may be collected at the broad occupation level in some areas and at the detailed level in others. Occupations below the detailed level The coding system is designed to allow SOC users desiring a delineation of occupations below the detailed occupation level to use a decimal point and additional digit(s) after the sixth digit. For example, Secondary School Teacher s, Except Special and Career/Technical Education (25 - 2031) is a detailed occupation. Agencies wishing to collect more particular information on teachers by subject matter might use 25 -2031.01 for secondary school science teachers or 25 - 2031.02 for secondary school mathematics teachers. Additional levels of detail also may be used to distinguish workers who have different training or years of experience. OMB recommends that SOC users needing extra detail should employ the structure of the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration's Occupational Information Network (O*NET). For more information, see https ://online.onetcenter.org . Higher levels of aggregation Some users may wish to present occupational data at higher levels of aggregation than the SOC major groups. To meet this need and t o maintain consistency and comparability across datasets, BLS recommends that either the intermediate or the high- level aggregations presented in t ables 5 and 6 should be used for data tabulation purposes. Table 5. Intermediate a ggregation to 13 groups , 2018 SOC Intermediate aggregation Major groups included Intermediate aggregation t itle 1 11-13 Management, Business, and Financial Occupations 2 15-19 Computer, Engineering, and Science Occupations 3 21-27 Education, Legal, Community Service, Arts, and Media Occupations 4 29 Healthcare Practitioner s and Technical Occupations 5 31-39 Service Occupations 6 41 Sales and Related Occupations 7 43 Office and Administrative Support Occupations 8 45 Farming, Fishing, and Forestry Occupations 9 47 Construction and Extraction Occupations 10 49 Installation, Maintenance, and Repair Occupations 11 51 Production Occupations 12 53 Transportation and Material Moving Occupations 13 55 Military Specific Occupations 15Table 6.

For example, an agency might report the detail of at least one occupational category at a particular level of the SOC structure but must aggregate the other occupations at that level. In such cases, the agency may adjust the occupational categories so long as these adjustments permit aggregation to the next higher SOC level. In such a situation, agencies must distinguish such groups from the official SOC aggregation. If agencies choose this option, they must obtain approval from the SOCPC for their proposed aggregation scheme. 16Frequently asked questions 1. How do the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau determine if they can collect and report on an occupation? (See Classification Principle 9.) The B ureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) develops estimates of occupational employment and wages, by wage and salary workers in nonfarm establishments in its Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) Survey. This survey collects information from business establishments sampled by industry and geographic area. The information provided by employers on their workers' job titles and job descriptions must be distinct and sufficient to classify into a single occupation. If employers do not provide information to classify workers into a proposed occupation, that occupation would not be collectable for the OES program. BLS looks at the definition, and at the size and dispersion of (estimated) employment, in determining whether it can collect and report data on an occupation. If the occupation is widely dispersed across areas and/or industries, employment in an occupation must be sizeable to be reliably measured. If the occupation is highly concentrated in a single industry or area, smaller levels of employment can be reliably measured. The Census Bureau develops estimates of occupational employment of the population with its household-based Current Population Survey (a joint program with BLS) and American Community Survey. As with the BLS collection procedures , the Census Bureau is concerned about the size and dispersion of employment in an occupation in determining if it can collect and report reliable data on that occupation. In addition, the Census Bureau considers whether the respondents to its household surveys, who may provide information for themselves as well as for other household members, are likely to report the job titles and job activities associated with an occupation accurately and completely. Household survey respondents tend to give general or informa l, rather than specific or technical, occupational titles. For example, a household survey respondent may report \"doctor,\" rather than \"pediatrician .\" This makes it difficult for the Census Bureau to report on such specialized occupations. 2. What is the di fference between an occupation and a job? When reviewing and evaluating individual proposals, the SOCPC considered the degree to which a proposed addition relates to a job rather than an occupation. In many cases, job titles intrinsically represent jobs, rather than true occupations as defined in the SOC. Specifically, a job is a set of work activities performed by an individual. The exact set of activities varies depending on the size and organization of the establishment and is often, but not always, unique to that individual worker. An occupation is a grouping of a number of individual jobs. Thus, an occupational definition is a collective description of a number of similar individual jobs performed, with minor variations, in different establishments. O ccupational classification schemes such as the SOC organize millions of jobs into discrete occupations on the basis of their similarities as determined by the schemes' classification principles. For example, in the 2018 SOC, workers with the job title \" Coronary Care Unit Staff Nurse\" are classified in the 2018 SOC occupation \" Registered Nurses (29 -1141).\" Likewise, workers with the job title \"Automotive Fuel Injection Servicer\" are classified in the 2018 SOC occupation Automotive Service Technicians and Mechanics (49 -3023). 17 3. Why doesn't every job title have its own code in the SOC? Occupational classification schemes examine and organize the millions of jobs and tens of thousands of job titles in the economy into occupations based upon their similaritie s as determined by the scheme's classification principles. The organizing principle of the SOC system is work performed rather than job title so there are many fewer occupation codes in the SOC than there are jobs in the economy. 4. What is the difference between the SOC Classification Principles and the Coding Guidelines? The SOC Classification Principles form the basis on which the SOC system is structured. The Coding Guidelines are intended to assist SOC users in consistently assigning SOC occupational codes to survey responses. 5. Who uses the SOC? Government agencies that collect and publish occupational statistical data use the SOC. See FAQ number 6 for more detail. At the f ederal level, these agencies and programs include: Department of Commerce Census Bureau Department of Defense Department of Education Department of Health and Human Services Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Projections Program Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey National Compensation Survey National Longitudinal Surveys Occupational Employment Statistics Occupational Health and Safety Statistics Occupational Requirements Survey Employment and Training Administration Employment Standards Administration Department of Transportation Bureau of Transportation Statistics Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for Veterans Analysis and Statistics Equal Employment Opportunity Commission National Sc ience Foundation National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics Office of Personnel Management 6. Where can I get information on the occupations in the SOC? 18Depending on the type of information you are seeking, you may obtain information from sever al agencies: a) The Bureau of Labor Statistics ' Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program produces cross-industry occupational employment and wage estimates for the nation , all states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, metropolitan areas, metropolitan divisions, and nonmetropolitan areas. (S ee https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm). OES also publishes national industry- specific occupational employment and wage esti mates for sectors and three -, four- , and selected five- digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industries. For assistance with these data, contact the OES program at (202) 691-6569 or send an email to oesinfo@bls.gov. Industry- specific occupational data for s tates are available from BLS as a research data set. Metropolitan and nonmetropolitan area industry data may be available from the s tate workforce agencies by contacting the individual s tate or s tates for which information is needed. Contact information for the s tate workforce agencies is available at https://www.bls.gov/bls/ofolist.htm . b) The Bureau of Labor Statistics' Employment Projections (E P) program produces 10- year projections of employment by occupation and industry for the nation as a whole. BLS national projections are shared with state workforce agencies to produce state and local area projections. In addition, EP publishes two career information publications that provide narrative descriptions of occupations: the Occupational Outlook Handbook (https://www.bls.gov/ooh) and Career Outlook (https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook). For more information about these data and publications, visit https://www.bls.gov/emp or contact the program at ep-info@bls.gov or (202) 691-5700. c) The Bureau of Labor Statistics ' National Compensation Survey (NCS) program provides comprehensive measures of job requirements and occupational compensation. Its Occupational Requirements Survey (ORS) component gathers job- related information regarding physical demands, environmental conditions, mental and cognitive demands, and vocational preparation requirements at the detailed occupational level. It's Compensation Levels and Trends component publishes changes and levels of labor costs, as well as the incidence and provisions of employer-provided benefits, by worker and establishment characteristics. The OES and NCS are combined to produce the Bureau's Modeled Wage Estimates, which provide annual estimates of average hourly wages for occupations by selected job characteristics and within geographical locations. For more information, see the main program pages at https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ , https://www.bls.gov/ors/, and http://www.bls.gov/mwe or call (202) 691-6199, or email NCSInfo@bls.gov. Correspondence may be sent to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics National Compensation Survey, 2 Massachusetts Ave., NE., Room 4160, Washington, DC 20212-0001. d) The Current Population Survey (CPS), a joint program of the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, uses the Census occupational classification system, which is derived from the Standard Occupational Classification. CPS data series are available on this classi fication beginning with the year 2011. The 2010 Census occupational classification was introduced with CPS data for January 2011 and replaced an earlier version that was based on the 2000 19SOC. Historical data were not revised. As a result, CPS occupational data beginning with January 2011 are not strictly comparable with earlier years. The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes national-level estimates of occupational employment, unemployment, and earnings with demographic detail from the CPS. The CPS homepage on the BLS website is at https://www.bls.gov/cps/home.htm ; contact information for the BLS CPS program can be found at https://www.bls.gov/cps/contact.htm . e)The U .S. Census Bureau publishes occupational data annually, collected through the American Community Survey (ACS), for the nation , all s tates and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all counties and places with populations of at least 65,000. The CensusBureau also publishes 5- year ACS data for all geographies in the United States and Puerto Rico. Census 2020 will collect, classify, and publish occupational data for Guam, AmericanSamoa, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Otherhousehold surveys publish occupational data at varying levels of detail and geography.Standard tabulations are available through the American FactFinder athttp://www .factfinder. census.gov. Information about occupation coding and written reports on occupational trends can be found at https://www.census.gov/people/io/. For additionalinformation, contact the Census Bureau's Question and Answer Center athttp://ask.census.gov or contact the Call Center at (301) 763- INFO. f)The D epartment of Defense publishes data that cross- reference military occupational codes of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard with civilian equivalentoccupations. Additional information on available data products can be obtained athttps://www.dmdc.osd.mil ; or by writing to Director, Defense Manpower Data Center, 1600 Wilson Blvd., Suite 400, Arlington, VA 22209-2593. g)The National Center fo r Education Statistics (NCES) uses the SOC to code occupational data on a national sample of adults in its Adult Training and Education Survey, which examinesadults' attainment of professional certifications and licenses and their participation in work-experience programs. The SOC is also used in the National Teacher and Principal Survey to code the employment of elementary and secondary teachers prior to their entry to teachingand after they leave teaching. NCES also uses the SOC to code staff at postsecondaryeducation institutions, collected through the Integrated Postsecondary Education DataSystem. Finally, NCES conducts various longitudinal studies that follow high school andcollege students into their working years and uses the SOC to classify thei r occupations. Data, reports, and other products based on these data collections are available athttp://nces.ed.gov. h) The E mployment and Training Administration's (ETA) Occupational Information Network (O*NET) system is a comprehensive database of occupational competency profiles. ETAsponsors the development, updating, and dissemination of O*NET information through agrant with the North Carolina Employment Security Commission. The O*NET system isbased on the SOC system and also provides information on additional detailed occupationswithin a n SOC category in selected instances. The O*NET Content Model of occupational descriptors is the foundation for a series of survey questionnaires that go out to incumbentworkers in various occupations, which form the basis for the O*NET occupational 20competency profiles. The O*NET system is the successor to the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, which was last published by the Department of Labor in 1991. O*NET information is availabl e at https ://online.onetcenter.org and also as a downloadable database from the O*NET Resource Center: https ://www.onetcenter.org/database.html . For more information, contact O*NET Customer Support at onet@ncmail.net or contact the Department of Labor at o-net@dol.gov. You can also write to the O*NET project director at Office of Workforce Investment, Employment and Training Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, FPB Room S 4231, 200 Constitution Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20210. i)The E qual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) uses SOC occupational classifications, and equivalent Census occupational classifications, to create broadercategories as part of the Commission 's data survey and enforcement programs. Under the survey program, employer workforce information is collected periodically from privatesector firms o n the Employer Information Report (EEO-1) and public sector employers on the State and Local Government Report (EEO- 4). More information may be obtained at https://www.eeoc.gov. j)The N ational Science Foundation (NSF) National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) website provides access to the Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), a comprehensive and integrated system of information about theemployment, educational, and demographic characteristics of scientists and engineers in the United States. It is intended for both policy analysis and general research, having features for both the casual and more intensive data user. More information may be obtained from theSESTAT at https ://www.nsf.gov/statistics/sestat . 7. Whom should I contact if I have a question about the SOC? For que stions about how the SOC is used in specific programs, contact the program. For specific questions about the SOC you may call the SOC information line at 202- 691-6500 or send an email to SOC@bls.gov. 8.Why are there different levels of detail in the SOC? The f our-tiered levels in the SOC enable users to choose the level or levels of detail corresponding to their interest and ability to collect data on different occupations. Users needing different levels of detail will still be able to compare data at the defined levels. Approved modi fications to the structure allow for alternative levels of aggregation. 9. Why ca n't I find my job title in the SOC? This manual lists occupations that include workers with many different job titles. It does not attempt to provide an exhaustive list of job titles. Often , a job title can be found in more than one occupation or occupational group (ex. \"Team Supervisor\") . When a job title is found in only one occupation, it may be included in a list of additional titles called the Direct Match T itle F ile, which is available at https ://www.bls.gov/soc. If your title is not listed, you may email 21SOC@bls.gov to suggest its inclusion. Instructions for submitting your recommendation, and other files related to the Direct Match Title File , are also available on that website. 10.Whi ch occupations in the SOC cover \"professionals\"? The 2018 SOC does not classify or identify workers using the term \"professional.\" The SOC covers all workers who work for pay or profit and does not cover occupations unique to volunteers. The SOC does not use other similar terms such as \"white collar,\" \"blue collar ,\" \"skilled ,\" or \"unskilled .\" The SOC was created solely for statistical purposes (S ee FAQ number 12.), and the classification structure is not intended to rank or group occupations by education, credentials, earnings, or any other similar user -defined indicator of status. However, government agencies or private users may define and use various terms to suit their own purposes. For example, the Employment and Training Administration 's O*NET program classifies occupations into 1 of 5 \"job zones,\" based on data regarding the levels of education, experience, and training needed for work in an occupation, ranging from \" little or no \" to \"extensive\" preparation. A detailed report on the procedure for using O*NET survey data and other information to assign job zones to O*NET occupations is available at: http://www.onetcenter.org/reports/JobZoneProcedure.html. 11.Why are supervisors of workers in Major Groups 13-0000 through 31-0000 not listed? Where should they be classified? Super visors of workers in Major Grou ps 13-0000 through 29-0000 are classified wi th the occupations they supervise because they generally have the same type of training, education, and experience as the workers they supervise. Classification Principle 4 states that these supervisors are classified with the workers they supervise. Supervisors of workers in Major Group 31-0000 are usually classified in Major Group 29-0000. See Classification Principles 5. 12. How a re workers classified into occupations under the SOC system? Can the SOC provide classification determinations for nonstatistical purposes, such as prevailing wages? The S OC Coordinating Team is often asked about coding occupations for reasons that are not statistical in nature, such as for prevailing wage determinations. The SOC was developed for use by federal statistical agencies to classify workers into occupationa l categories for the specific purpose of producing statistical data. The SOC Coordinating Team can provide guidance that is in accordance with the 2018 SOC Classification Principles and Coding Guidelines . However , this guidance is solely to help users of statistical data find workers who perform a specific set of work activities or to help statistical data collectors. The SOC Coordinating Team cannot make official classification determinations for nonstatistical p urposes, such as prevailing wages. It is up to customers using the SOC for nonstatistical purposes to review the detailed definitions for the SOC codes and determine the best match, in light of their own program and policy purposes. Such users are not limited to following the SOC classification principles and guidelines used by federal statistical agencies. For example, users may develop their own policies concerning workers that meet the definition of two or more occupations. 22Under the SOC system , workers are classified into occupations based on their job duties, not their job titles. Workers with the same title may be classified in different occupations, based on their individual job duties. The best way to proceed is to look at the various definitions for the SOC codes and determine which best matches the work being performed. Starting with the major group level, you can examine more and more specific groups from minor groups to detailed occupations. Definitions are available only at the detailed occupati on level, which is indicated by a code ending in a number other than 0. Workers who do not perform activities described in any distinct detailed occupation are included in an appropriate (\"All Other \") occupation. The \"All Other\" occupations appear as the l ast occupation in a group and are indicated by a code ending in the number 9. More information on using the SOC to classify workers can be found in the 2018 SOC Classification Principles and Coding Guidelines. The Classification Principles form the basis o n which the SOC system is structured. The Coding Guidelines are intended to assist users in the federal statistical agencies in consistently assigning SOC codes and titles to survey responses and in other coding activities. Warranting specific m ention are Classification Principles 1 and 2, as well as Coding Guideline 2. Classification Principle 1 states that \"Each occupation is assigned to only one occupational category at the most detailed level of the classification.\" Classification Principle 2 states that \"Occupations are classified b ased on work performed and, in some cases, on the skills, education, and/or training needed to perform the work.\" Coding Guideline 2 states that \"When workers in a single job could be coded in more than one occupation, they should be coded in the occupation that requires the highest level of skill. If there is no measurable difference in skill requirements, workers should be coded in the occupation in which they spend the most time.\" The 2018 S OC was designed solely for statistical purposes. Although it is likely that the 2018 SOC also will be used for various nonstatistical purposes (e.g., for administrative, regulatory, or taxation functions), the requirements of government agencies or private users that choose to use the 2018 SOC for nonstatistical purposes have played no role in its development, nor will OMB modify the classification to meet the requirements of any nonstatistical program. Consequently, the 2018 SOC is not to be used in any administrative, regulatory, or tax program unless the head of the agency administering that program has first determined that the use of such occupational definitions is appropriate to the implementation of the program' s objectives. 13. Wher e can I find how the 2018 SOC relates t o the 2010 SOC? The official crosswalk s can be found at https://www.bls.gov/soc. Occupations are crosswalked from the 2018 SOC to the 2010 SOC and from the 2010 SOC to the 2018 SOC. 14.Whe n will f ederal statistical agencies begin using the 2018 SOC in survey collection? Feder al statistical agencies will begin using the 2018 SOC for occupational data they publish for reference years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. However , it is important to note that for some programs, full implementation of the 2018 SOC will occur in stages , as sufficient data are needed to produce estimates at the full level of occupational detail. Contact an agency or 23program directly for specific information on implementation. A schedule of implementation dates for programs within the Bureau of Labor Statistics will be available at https://www.bls.gov/soc. 24Acknowledgements SOCPC Members Laurie Salmon , Bureau of Labor Statistics, Chair Kristina Bartsch , Bureau of Labor Statistics, former acting Chair Dixie Sommers, Bureau of Labor Statistics , former Chair Paul Bugg, Office of Management and Budget Melissa Chiu, Census Erich Cromwell, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Jennifer Day, Census Joseph Donovan, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Keenan Dworak -Fisher, Bureau of Labor Statistics Romella El Kharzazi, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Pam Frugoli, Employment and T raining Administration Frank Gallo, Employment and Training Administration Margaret Glos, Health Resources and Services Administration Kerry Gruber, National Center for Education Statistics Don Haughton, Employment and Training Administration Lisa Hudson, National Center for Education Statistics Carrie Jo nes, Bureau of Labor Statistics Nimmi Kannankutty, National Science Foundation Robert LaJeunesse, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Lynda Laughlin, Census Kerrie Leslie, Office of Management and Budge t Teri Morisi, Bureau of Labor Statistics Jennifer Park , Office of Management and Budget Jennifer Pirtle, Employment and Training Administration Sabrina Ratchford, National Center for Education Statistics Steve Reardon, Defense Manpower Data Center Tara Ri cci, Office of Personnel Management Marc Rosenblum, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Ed Salsberg, Health Resources and Services Administration Hossain Eftekhari-Sanjani, Bureau of Transportation Statistics Hilery Simpson, Bureau of Labor Statistics Elvira Sisolak, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission George Stamas, Bureau of Labor Statistics Renee Toback, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Michelle Washko, Health Resources and Services Administration Michael Wolf, Bureau of Labor Statistics 25Workgroup Chairs Melissa Chiu, Census Jennifer Day, Census Keenan Dworak -Fisher, Bureau of Labor Statistics Lisa Hudson, National Center for Education Statistics Carrie Jones, Bureau of Labor Statistics Nimmi Kannankutty, National Science Foundation Lynda Laughlin, Census Hilery Simpson, Bureau of Labor Statistics Steve Reardon, Defense Manpower Data Center Michelle Washko, Health Resources and Services Administration SOC Coordinating Team Charlin Caster, Bureau of Labor Statistics.

2018 SOC 241242Appendix B : Crosswalk from the 2018 SOC to the 2010 SOC Appendix B matches every detailed occupation from the 2018 SOC with the corresponding previous 2010 SOC code(s) and title(s). A double hashtag (##) after the occupation code and title in the first column means that the occupation in the second column makes up only part of the occupation in the first column; that is, the double hashtag 2018 SOC occupation has been created from multiple 2010 SOC codes (i.e. merge of existing detailed occupations). Likewise, a single hashtag (#) after the occupation code and title in the second column means that the occupation in the first column makes up only part of the occupation in the second column; that is, the single hashtag 2010 SOC occupation has been divided into multiple new occupations (i.e. breakout of existing detailed occupation). Each occupation with the (# ) or ( ##) notation appears multiple times in the chart. For example, as shown below, the 2018 SOC occupation 25- 4022 \" Librarians and Media Collections Specialists (##)\" (with two hashtags) was created from two 2010 SOC occupations: 25-4021 Librarians and 25-9011 Audio- Visual and Multimedia Collections . The 2010 SOC occupation; 11-2031 \"Public Rel ations and Fundraising Managers (#) \" (with one hashtag ) was divided into two occupations in the 2018 SOC: 11-2032 Public Relations Managers and 11-
