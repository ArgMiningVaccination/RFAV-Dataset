The youth not only took part in equine activities and discussions but also assembled, decorated and potted 50 live succulent plants that were accompanied by notes and cards of encouragement and positivity for patients at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton's Cancer Center and Infusion Center. In addition to participating in the compassionate activity, a few of the youth personally delivered the gifts to the Cancer Center. \"During the recent omicron surge, our healthcare workers went above and beyond during an extraordinarily difficult time. Their commitment to their patients and the community was incredibly gratifying and is representative of the extraordinary dedication of our RWJBarnabas Health workforce.\" BARRY H. OSTROWSKY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RWJBARNABAS HEALTH \"As we faced many new challenges earlier this year, the entire team at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton, including those in nonclinical roles like dietary, environmental services, security, pastoral care and volunteers\u2014 even while managing their own health\u2014continued to serve our patients, their families and loved ones with hard work, dedication and quality care, and I couldn't be more proud.

RWJUHH_Calendar_Spr22_Final_10.5.indd 7RWJUHH_Calendar_Spr22_Final_10.5.indd 7 3/7/22 9:07 AM3/7/22 9:07 AMTo learn more about interpreter services at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton, visit www.rwjbh.org/rwj-university-hospital-hamilton/patients-visitors/special-services/interpreter-services. A new technology has been implemented across RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) that breaks down language barriers, eases communication between patients, families and providers, and furthers the health system's mission to overcome health disparities. Known as MARTTI (My Accessible Real-Time Trusted Interpreter), the technology was implemented at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton in October 2021. It provides 24/7 access to medical interpreters in more than 250 languages. MARTTI devices resemble IV carts with 12-inch tablets attached and are easily wheeled anywhere they are needed\u2014from the registration desk or triage area to the bedside or physical therapy session. At any point of care, limited English- proficient (LEP) patients and families can feel confident they will understand key information about a condition, a treatment or ongoing medical needs, and have the ability to speak up and accurately communicate. \"The MARTTI system helps create a comfort zone for the patient and family, and ultimately improves the patient experience,\" says Jill Anderson, MBA, Vice President, Patient Experience at RWJBH. \"We want to make sure LEP community members feel connected with our staff and feel the compassion we bring to patient care,\" Anderson continues. \"Improving communication has numerous benefits for our limited English-proficient patients and families, including increased patient safety.\" A GROWING NEED Trends indicate increased need for interpretation services across RWJBH. About one-third of New Jersey residents speak a language other than English at home. Nearly 4 million interpretation minutes\u2014a measure of demand for interpretation services\u2014were used across the RWJBH system in 2020, an increase of more than 22 percent from the previous year. About 100 languages have been interpreted, with Spanish the most frequent. MARTTI can help LEP patients and families as soon as they enter RWJBH inpatient and outpatient facilities. The patient or a family member can point out their country of origin on the MARTTI screen and choose from a list of languages. An on-screen medical interpreter will then converse with them in the patient's native language. Requests for MARTTI carts at RWJBH have exceeded expectations. Initial estimates were for between 200 and 250 devices, but by the end of January 2022, more than twice that many had rolled out. Patient response has been enthusiastic. \"Patients love it, and the staff has raved about it from both a clinical and safety perspective,\" Anderson says. Seth Rosenbaum, MD, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at RWJUH Hamilton, and Clinical Assistant Professor, Department of Medicine, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, says many of his patients require translation services. \"Having MARTTI available for use is a tremendous asset to both our patients and staff,\" Dr. Rosenbaum says. \"It allows our staff to effectively communicate to our patients in their primary language, making them feel more comfortable during some of their most difficult times. MARTTI also helps drive the high-quality care that we provide on a daily basis to everyone here at RWJUH Hamilton.\"The MARTTI video system helps RWJUH Hamilton providers communicate with a patient and family using a live interpreter.

If you or a loved one needs treatment for cancer, here's what you should know: FACT #1 You don't have to travel to a nearby city, such as New York or Philadelphia, to access a clinical trial. As New Jersey's only National Cancer Institute-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, together with RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH), offers a wide range of clinical trials, many of which aren't available elsewhere. Patients may participate in a clinical trial either at an RWJBH hospital near where they live or at Rutgers Cancer Institute. \"We've integrated cancer care so that we're putting the standards and expertise of an NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, as well as clinical trials, in all 12 hospitals in the RWJBH system,\" says Howard Hochster, MD, FACP, Director, Oncology Research for RWJBH, and Associate Director, Clinical Research, for Rutgers Cancer Institute. FACT #2 Clinical trials have led to significant advances in treatment. Treatments developed through these trials have helped tens of thousands of patients. For example, Rutgers Cancer Institute: Was the first to offer trials with specific immunotherapy drugs that worked for many skin cancers, especially Merkel cell carcinoma. Participated in a trial for a first- line colon cancer treatment that led to excellent responses for a number of patients, making them eligible for potentially curative surgery. Has pioneered immunotherapy treatments resulting in better management of many cancers, including renal cell cancer and bladder cancer. \"When I started out treating colon cancer 25 years ago, we had only one drug available, and it dated back to the 1960s,\" says Dr. Hochster. \"Since that time, we've developed three new chemotherapy drugs and five new targeted drugs for colon cancer, and all of them were developed through clinical trials. Now people are living with colon cancer, on average, four times as long as they used to.\" FACT #3 Clinical trials are not a last resort. \"It's important for people to understand that enrolling in a clinical trial is often an option for a first-line or early treatment,\" says Dr. Hochster. \"These trials are a way for us to give patients the latest treatments before they're widely available. They offer tomorrow's treatments today.\" To determine whether a patient would be best suited for a clinical trial or for standard care, each individual case is evaluated by a multidisciplinary team of cancer experts from throughout RWJBH and Rutgers Cancer Institute. Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBH currently offer approximately 270 different clinical trials.

Her son took her to the emergency department, where an electrocardiogram determined that there was a problem with the electrical signals in her heart. The next morning, doctors implanted a pacemaker. \"Her diagnosis was clearly aided by her having an Apple Watch,\" says the woman's cardiologist, Gary Rogal, MD, Medical Director for RWJBarnabas Health Cardiovascular Services and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. \"I believe wearable digital devices that measure heart rhythm will become a major addition to the diagnostic tool kit for cardiologists.\" Who should wear one of these devices? The short answer: people whose doctors recommend it. \"Wearable cardiac devices are very handy tools, but you have to be selective about how you use them,\" says Dr. Rogal. THE HEART'S RHYTHM The main value of wearable cardiac technology lies in its ability to detect cardiac arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, Dr. Rogal explains. These \"Call your doctor,\" said the message on the 87-year-old woman's Apple Watch. A regular walker and exerciser, the woman wasn't feeling right, so she'd PARTHO SENGUPTA, MD GARY ROGAL, MD LISTENING TO YOUR HEART RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 11 Healthy Together | 10 10System_CardiacWearables_Spr22_final_10.5.indd 10 3/4/22 3:21 PM3/4/22 electrical signals that coordinate the heart's beats don't work properly. In turn, the heart can't pump blood effectively. Symptoms of arrhythmia include a fluttering in the chest, shortness of breath, fainting, dizziness or a feeling that the heart is racing or beating too slowly. The symptoms may be brief or long-lasting, and they can indicate a condition that's anywhere from harmless to life-threatening. \"If I'm concerned about arrhythmia based on what the patient is telling me, but just can't nail down the diagnosis, I might suggest that a patient use a wearable cardiac device,\" says Dr. Rogal. \"The decision should be made along with a physical exam and a knowledge of the patient's medical history and symptoms. If there's no real reason to have one, wearing the device could do nothing more than make a patient anxious.\" NEW TOOLS An early form of wearable cardiac technology, the Holter monitor, has been around for decades. This device uses electrodes (small, plastic patches on the skin) to record the electrical activity of the heart. \"A patient can wear a Holter monitor for 24 to 48 hours or even longer,\" Dr. Rogal explains. \"The reality is, though, that some patients have arrhythmias once every few weeks or even every few months, and a Holter monitor could miss that,\" he says. \"That's the type of thing a smartwatch would pick up.\" Dozens of wearable devices are on the market today. Examples include: KardiaMobile, a pocket-sized portable EKG machine that allows patients to put their fingers on sensors and share the results with their doctor. The MCOT Patch System, which monitors the heart rhythm for two weeks via a sensor on the patient's chest. Other digital cardiac devices, which must be implanted by a physician, are also coming into wider use. Examples include: A device called CardioMEMS, which monitors pulmonary artery pressure and sends the results to a team of clinicians. A loop recorder, a device smaller than a USB flash drive, that's placed just underneath the skin near the breastbone. It can continuously record a patient's heart rhythm for up to three years. \"If a patient calls me and says, 'Hey, I'm feeling funny, a little lightheaded,' I can interrogate the loop recorder and see what the heart rhythm was during that symptom,\" says Dr. Rogal. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE The key to the success of these technologies lies in artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014the ability of a computer to compare an individual's data against that of thousands of other patients and flag information that may be significant. \"AI allows information to be provided to the care team in a very nuanced way,\" says Partho Sengupta, MD, Chief of the Cardiology Service Line at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) and Chief of the Division of Cardiology at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. \"The device will only send an alert if it thinks the data is moving in the wrong direction and the patient is not doing well, as opposed to a steady stream of data, which can be overwhelming.\" The cardiology team at RWJUH meets regularly with doctors in the community to discuss the digital transformation of cardiology and consider innovations for treatment. Dr. Sengupta and his colleagues are conducting several clinical trials, including one for an armband that can monitor multiple physiological signals and offer personalized recommendations for a patient's care. \"For the future of cardiology, our overall concept is that care starts in the patient's home and ends at home, with the hospital and the clinic only points along the way,\" Dr. Sengupta says. \"In order for us to connect the whole journey, we need to have the ability to continuously monitor a patient's health. \"It's like how we use a GPS to help us on a road journey,\" he says. \"Now it's time to take that approach and apply it to our health journeys.\" Whoever your heart beats for, our hearts beat for you.

When the second one hit, crowds of people looked frantically for a way out of lower Manhattan. \"We were the first boat to start evacuating,\" Moyet recalls. \"We were facing a stampede.\" He worked until 3 a.m. the next day, transporting people away from danger. For the next year and a half, he continued to work in the Ground Zero area, shuttling federal agents, policemen, firemen and workers from throughout the country to lower Manhattan. Some two decades later, Moyet himself needed help. In January 2018, he sought care for what he thought was a severe cold with a cough that wouldn't stop. \"My doctor told me it was COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease],\" he says. Long- term lung problems are an unfortunate reality for many 9/11 first responders, who breathed in massive amounts of smoke, dust and fumes. On Sept. 11, 2001, Tony Moyet began his workday the same way as he had for the previous five years, by transporting about 300 commuters per trip from Hoboken to the World Financial Center in Manhattan on a NY Waterway ferry. \"That morning, though, when I dropped off a set of passengers, I saw the gaping hole in the North Tower, with flames coming out of it,\" Moyet recalls. \"I radioed [then NY Waterway port captain] Michael McPhillips and told him to send boats down in case we THE FREEDOM TO BREATHE THIRUVENGADAM ANANDARANGAM, MD JESUS GOMEZ-ABRAHAM, MD Two decades after 9/11, double lung transplant recipient Tony Moyet visits the NY Waterway ferry.

By spring 2020, he had developed end- stage COPD/emphysema and end-stage advanced pulmonary disease. He needed inhaled oxygen 24 hours a day; he couldn't climb stairs or sleep without it. \"He told me, 'Doc, I just need two more years to see my daughter graduate from high school,'\" says pulmonologist Thiruvengadam Anandarangam, MD, Division Chief, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center (NBI). \"I told him that we're hoping we can give him enough time to see her graduate and also to walk her down the aisle someday.\" Moyet's best hope to extend his life was a double lung transplant. \"At the time, he was on 17 medications and medical management wasn't providing any more relief,\" says transplant surgeon Jesus Gomez-Abraham, MD, Associate Surgical Director of Lung Transplantation at NBI and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. Dr. Gomez-Abraham added Moyet to the lung transplant database on Friday, July 2. While the average lung transplant patient waits four months for a match, and even longer when a double lung transplant is required, Moyet's care team found his match the very next day. \"That was amazing\u2014 very unusual,\" Dr. Anandarangam says. \"He was listed on Friday. On Saturday, we found a donor in a neighboring state. I traveled there to look at the organs, and they matched Tony's size and blood type perfectly.\" On Sunday, July 4, Dr. Gomez-Abraham performed the double lung transplant. Eighteen days later, Moyet returned home. BREATHING EASIER His fast recovery, say his doctors, was driven by his determination to get better. \"When I saw him just before the transplant, he was already in better shape than the last time I had seen him,\" Dr. Gomez-Abraham says. \"He had done what he needed to do to improve his nutrition, and was doing pulmonary rehabilitation and physical therapy to increase his chance of better results.\" Moyet credits his caregivers at NBI for their guidance and persistence. \"After the transplant, I had to learn to walk and move all over again,\" he says. \"My nurses pushed me to keep going, even on days I didn't want to walk. They were dressed in blue; I called them my Blue Angels. They're the sweetest people in the world.\" Just two months after his double lung transplant, Moyet, 65, was taking walks again with his wife, Arlene, and 15-year- old daughter, Sophia. \"I don't need oxygen, and my lungs are working great,\" he says. He commemorated the 20th anniversary of 9/11 by joining a group chat hosted by the World Trade Center Health Program. And he's planning for a bright future, including a possible trip to Europe. \"My doctors are great people\u2014miracle workers,\" Moyet says. \"They cared so much and saw me in the hospital every day. It was a great team that put me all back together again.\"THE FREEDOM TO BREATHETony Moyet with his family at NBI's cardiothoracic ICU, several days after his lifesaving lung transplant surgery. SPECIAL CARE FOR SERIOUS LUNG PROBLEMS People with the most complex lung conditions rely on the Advanced Lung Disease and Transplant Program at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center (NBI), the only lung transplant program in New Jersey. Who is a candidate for a lung transplant? \"The majority of patients have end-stage COPD and emphysema,\" says Jesus Gomez-Abraham, MD. \"Other possible candidates are those with cystic fibrosis or pulmonary fibrosis as well as those with certain congenital cardiac diseases.\" Candidates at NBI are evaluated through a multidisciplinary approach that includes surgeons, pulmonologists, cardiologists, gastroenterologists and others. What is life like after a lung transplant? \"Patients will increase their lung function capacity up to 60 to 90 percent,\" says Dr. Gomez-Abraham. \"Once the transplant has settled in, the majority of patients do not need oxygen. They can go to the mall, go to the beach, go to the family reunion, go back to work. The lung transplantation gives them the freedom to develop a normal life.\" To learn more about transplant services at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, call 888.724.7123 or visit www.rwjbh.org/lungtransplant.

Initial tests may include blood work, an electrocardiogram and more. The patient will also undergo a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he or she is a candidate for one of the program's levels of treatment: Inpatient treatment in a 14-bed unit that offers psychological, medical, nursing and nutritional care. Partial hospitalization, up to five days a week, with three hours of therapy per day. Intensive outpatient services, up to three days a week, with three hours of therapy per day. The program offers weekly support groups for patients and for family and friends. \"Our programs are in- person, not virtual, because that human interaction is so important in connecting with patients,\" Corey says. \"So many people tell us, 'I just don't want to talk to a computer screen.'\"To learn more about RWJUH Somerset's nationally recognized Eating Disorders Program, call 800.300.0628 or visit www.rwjbh.org/eatingdisorders.Being quarantined at home, not being in school for extended periods, not seeing friends or playing organized sports: The restrictions of the pandemic have been keenly felt by adolescents. Pandemic-related stressors seem to be behind a recent dramatic increase in reported symptoms of eating disorders\u2014 binging, purging, drastically reduced caloric intake\u2014as well as a doubling of hospitalizations for those issues. \"The kids we're seeing are much more medically compromised and much more entrenched in the behaviors than we've seen in the past,\" says Lynn Corey, LCSW, CEDS/S, CETP, Clinical Manager of Behavioral Health Outpatient Services at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset. \"The pandemic has made the eating disorders worse, because so much of teens' lives feels out of their control,\" explains Corey, who works with the RWJUH Somerset Eating Disorders Program. \"An eating disorder is really not about food; it's a maladapted coping mechanism. Food becomes used as a means of giving themselves power over their lives. \"Moreover,\" Corey continues, \"when teens aren't in school, there are fewer eyes on them\u2014school nurses, guidance counselors and teachers\u2014to notice changes and collaborate with parents.\" GETTING HELP If a parent is worried about a child's eating habits, a trip to the primary care provider is a good first step, Corey says. \"If the pediatrician feels things aren't looking good, that can open the door for parents to set up an evaluation with our program.\" Thanks to its hospital affiliation, the RWJUH Somerset program is COPING WITH EATING DISORDERS: TIPS FOR FAMILIES Express honest affection, verbally and physically. Teach children to communicate with assertiveness so they can resist inappropriate messages from their peers, the media and others about weight. Do not demand weight gain or berate a family member. Develop a dialogue about personal issues other than food and weight. Get support and educate yourself through books, professional help and talking with other families.

Healthy Together | PB | Spring 2022 RWJBarnabas Health | PM3/4/22 3:35 PMYou're trying to quit smoking. You really want a cigarette. What do you do? Pills, medications and patches can help a person overcome a nicotine addiction. But equally important is to have support from the people in your life\u2014loved ones, colleagues, healthcare providers\u2014and from trained counselors who understand just how challenging the journey can be. The free Nicotine and Tobacco Recovery Program offered by the RWJBarnabas Health Institute for Prevention and Recovery (IFPR) employs a full range of tools to quit smoking, including counseling and support groups. Last summer, the program unveiled a new support option: a text-based service known as the Tobacco Recovery Concierge. The service offers real-time support via texting for moments when triggers or cravings are strong. \"In these cases, we can offer tips for a behavior change that they can make to help the craving subside, such as going for a walk, having a drink of water or doing breathing and relaxation exercises,\" explains Monica Hanna, MPH, CHES, NCTTP, Assistant Director of the Nicotine and Tobacco Recovery Program. \"Research has shown that cessation counseling and support can double a person's chances of success when quitting nicotine,\" she says. \"This new service allows us to tailor messages to patients for whatever they're going through at the moment.\" NOT JUST A HABIT Powered by GoMo Health, the Tobacco Recovery Concierge provides regular motivational and educational messages based on where a person is in his or her quit journey. These scheduled messages might include a link to a website where people share their stories, or to a calculator for figuring out exactly how much a person will save by quitting nicotine. For times when participants need immediate support, they can text one of a number of keywords such as \"craving,\" \"mood,\" \"relax\" or \"meet.\" Responses might include motivational messaging or a link to login information for IFPR Zoom meetings. A chat feature is also available through a HIPAA-secure portal. The program, which began in July 2021, has served more than 200 people so far and gets about 30 new signups each month, Hanna says. Quitting nicotine can be as hard as quitting heroin or cocaine, research shows. On average, people try to quit smoking five to seven times before they quit for good. \"Our goal is to break down the stigma of nicotine addiction. Even healthcare providers too often regard it as a bad habit,\" Hanna says. \"Instead, we approach it the same way we would treat a chronic disease such as diabetes or heart failure. We help patients deal with the physiological effects. And we know that when we combine that approach with counseling, a person's chances of success are much greater. No one should feel like they have to make this journey alone.\" A NEW SERVICE PROVIDES CUSTOMIZED SUPPORT. The Nicotine and Tobacco Recovery Program includes nicotine replacement therapies, recommendations on prescription smoking medication, and individual and group counseling. The program, funded by the New Jersey Department of Health Office of Tobacco Control, Nutrition and Fitness, is offered free of charge by the RWJBarnabas Health Institute for Prevention and Recovery in Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, Somerset and Union counties.

It consists of adults with full- time jobs under age 40 who participate in the hospital's governing structure, serve as a resource to leadership, often go on to future board memberships and participate in fundraising. YPG recently completed a $150,000 pledge over two-plus years to The Cancer Center at RWJUH Hamilton, together with Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, the state's only NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Fundraisers included All in Good Taste, Paint the Bar Pink and Family Movie Night events. \"Although the group is very much about supporting the hospital through fundraising events and pledges, it's also a networking and social group, with YPG events hosted by members,\" says Jessica Alleman, Director of Development, RWJUH Hamilton Foundation. \"They're very tight-knit.\" COMMUNITY LEADERS Eight new members joined the 30-person group in December 2021. Dugan took a two-year term as Chair after joining the group two years earlier. Applicants submit r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and interview with a nominating committee. \"We have a waiting list to be part of this,\" Alleman says. \"As we elected our most recent members, I already had four new people looking to get on next year.\" \"It's mutually beneficial for members in terms of career growth,\" Dugan says. \"A lot of young professionals haven't sat in a board meeting before, so learning about things like rules and procedures, hospital operations or how to talk to a donor can contribute to career education on top of the benefits of networking.\" Members who \"age off\" at 40 often interview for RWJUH Foundation or hospital boards or committees, volunteer at events or join the Community Impact Alliance (CIA), formerly the Auxiliary. Current CIA president Lindsay Jenkins is a former YPG member. Others play roles in state and local government and administration, medicine, law, business organizations, nonprofits and other community leadership positions. Many former members stay in close touch. \"The fact that YPG members continue to help grow the community and are mainstays in local organizations is a testament to the quality of the program and the success of the group as a whole,\" Dugan says. \"The people in this group are some of the most inspiring, selfless, philanthropic, empathetic people I've met in my life.

Knowing these values helps physicians assess your risks in more detail. 3 Walk regularly. Physical activity such as walking at a brisk pace for 30 minutes a day can lower your risk for cardiovascular disease by helping to control blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, blood sugar and other factors. 4 Eat heart-healthy foods. Give priority to fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains. Minimize red meat and processed meats, as well as saturated fats and sugar. Avoid overeating, as heavy meals have been associated with heart attacks. 5 Quit smoking. After one year, you'll have cut your risk of coronary disease by 50 percent.

To connect with a top cardiovascular specialist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton, call 888.724.7123 or visit www.rwjbh.org/heart. Mahmoud S. Ghusson, MD, understood more than 25 years ago the importance of having state-of-the-art cardiac care available locally at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton. \"Starting the cardiac catheterization lab at that time was a dramatic advance for Hamilton Township,\" says Dr. Ghusson, a long-time cardiologist with RWJUH Hamilton. \"Before that, patients who needed procedures such as angioplasty and stenting for a heart attack would often need to go to hospitals in Philadelphia. Offering lifesaving cardiac services from multidisciplinary cardiovascular experts close to home provided better, faster, safer and more convenient care for patients in our community. That continues to be true today.\" COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES \"Ever since our hospital began providing advanced cardiology a quarter century ago, our team has worked collaboratively to expand our cardiology services and achieve the highest levels of quality and efficacy,\" says Richard Freeman, Chief Executive Officer of RWJUH Hamilton. \"Our continually advancing capabilities further ensure that patients local to Hamilton don't have to leave our community to get the highest level of interventional cardiology care.\" Comprehensive cardiology services at RWJUH Hamilton include diagnostic catheterization, simple and complex angioplasty, imaging such as nuclear stress tests and echocardiograms, heart failure treatment, management of abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac rehabilitation. \"Our state-of-the-art providers help advance RWJUH Hamilton's goal of being a high-reliability organization in which every activity is performed at the highest level of excellence every time,\" Freeman says. \"Being a high-reliability organization improves every measure of quality, including safety, access to care, collaboration among providers and patient satisfaction.\" Patients at RWJUH Hamilton also have access to highly advanced care for higher-risk scenarios such as heart transplants through other RWJBarnabas Health hospitals. \"Being part of the same health system allows shared access to records and close relationships with collaborating providers who can continue the same high level of care we initiate at RWJUH Hamilton,\" Dr. Ghusson says. \"With our expertise and resources, we're continuously stepping forward in providing advanced cardiac care that's good for patients and good for the community.\"WORLD-CLASS CARDIAC CARE Richard Freeman, President and CEO, and Mahmoud S.

These early cancers generally don't affect life span at all.\" Yet many cancers are found at later stages or involve a complex mix of factors that affect care. And care itself can consist of a number of options from a range of specialists in multidisciplinary teams. \"Cancer care is increasingly personalized,\" says Deborah Toppmeyer, MD, Chief Medical Officer and Director of the Stacy Goldstein Breast Cancer Center at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and breast medical oncologist at The Cancer Center at RWJUH Hamilton. \"But it often starts with an abnormal mammogram.\" Once you're found to have an abnormal mammogram, here is what you and your cancer team may do next. It's hard to overstate the impact of regular mammograms. \"They are amazing screening tools,\" says Firas Eladoumikdachi, MD, Breast Surgical Oncologist at Rutgers Cancer Institute YOUR MAMMOGRAM LOOKS ABNORMAL.

The ordering physician (typically your primary care doctor or obstetrician/gynecologist) will review the report and discuss the findings further with the mammographer. The doctor will also look for physical signs like a lump or nipple discharge. You may need more imaging to get a clearer picture. GET A BIOPSY. If additional focused mammogram views continue to look suspicious, a breast surgeon or radiologist will perform a minimally invasive needle biopsy to obtain tissue samples for analysis. You may need surgery and/or other treatment if the biopsy finds cancer or high-risk cells\u2014 or if benign findings seem inconsistent with what is seen on your imaging studies, to assure that there is not an underlying malignancy that was not found on initial biopsy. MAKE A PLAN. You and your cancer team decide on the best course of treatment based on your priorities and what doctors recommend for optimal care. \"Decisions entail back-and- forth conversations between you and your providers about options, pros and cons,\" Dr. Eladoumikdachi says. This is called shared decision making. A multidisciplinary tumor board consisting of doctors such as surgical and medical oncologists, radiologists, genetic specialists and plastic surgeons reviews your mammogram and biopsy results to develop an appropriate treatment plan. CONSIDER SURGERY. Typically a diagnosis of localized breast cancer requires surgery. Options include lumpectomy to remove the tumor and nearby tissue but preserve the breast or a mastectomy to remove the entire breast. For women at significantly increased risk of developing a subsequent breast cancer (for example, women who have a variant of significance in a gene that predisposes to breast cancer), double mastectomy may be considered. You may have more options if cancer appears to be in the early stages. For example, lumpectomy may also require radiation treatment, while mastectomy for early-stage cancer may allow you to skip radiation. STAGE THE CANCER. Samples taken from lymph nodes will help reveal if cancer has spread beyond the breast. RECEIVE ADDITIONAL THERAPIES. Based in part on these findings, your breast cancer team will determine whether you need systemic treatment such as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, other targeted therapies or a combination. Radiation to consolidate local control may also be considered depending on the type of surgery, lymph node status and tumor size. UNDERGO BREAST RECONSTRUCTION. Many women undergo breast reconstruction at the time of mastectomy or following completion of systemic and local therapy. Many options are available to discuss with a plastic surgeon who works closely with the breast surgeon. Conversations before surgery help the surgical team plan an optimal course of reconstructive treatment. ENROLL IN A CLINICAL TRIAL. Through RWJUH Hamilton's partnership with Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, the state's only National Cancer Institute- Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, patients have access to clinical trials that can provide advanced treatment options. \"Clinical trials can provide access to novel therapies, new options for surgery, different methods of radiation therapy and more,\" Dr. Toppmeyer says. \"Through the participation of women and men in clinical trials, we have changed the natural history of breast cancer, both in early and advanced disease. If patients did not participate in clinical trials, we would not have made the extraordinary advances that we've seen, not only in breast cancer but other cancers as well.\" To learn more about the cancer care team at RWJUH Hamilton headed by Malini Patel, MD, Director of Medical Oncology, visit www.rwjbh.org/rwj-university-hospital-hamilton/treatment-care/cancer. ARE YOU AT RISK OF BREAST CANCER? Factors like these can influence your chances of developing breast cancer. Family history: Risks are higher if a first-degree relative such as a mother or sister, or multiple family members on either side have had breast cancer. Breast makeup: Dense breasts are more likely to develop breast cancer or evade cancer detection on mammograms. Age: The older you are, the more likely you are to develop breast cancer, especially after age 50, when most breast cancer diagnoses are made. Ethnic background: Breast cancer is often more aggressive in African American women, whose lower screening rates also result in more cancers being detected at relatively advanced stages. Inherited genetic mutations related to breast cancer such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 are also more common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Reproductive history: Having your first menstrual period before 12 or starting menopause after 55 both increase your risk for breast cancer because they increase lifetime exposure to estrogen.

GET READY FOR ACTION Before going on a run or starting competitive play, engage in five to 10 minutes of light, dynamic-movement activity that activates muscles and improves joint motion. That will increase your body temperature, engage muscles, boost blood flow, improve mobility and stimulate the nervous system, all of which lower the risk of injury. \"People tend to think static stretching helps prepare for activity, but you want muscles to be active, not relaxed,\" Stevens says. \"Focus on dynamic warm-up.\" As a part of their community-based athletic training partnerships, certified athletic trainers at RWJBarnabas Health have developed a three-phase dynamic warm-up system that can be taught to sports teams, coaches, organizations, workplaces and performance artists.

WORK OUT SAFELY Start with light, simple challenges and gradually build to more intense or complex workouts. If you're not sure where to start or how to progress, ask for guidance from a private fitness coach or Warmer air and longer days make spring a great time to increase outdoor physical activity\u2014if you do it without triggering aches and pains that hobble you or hold you back. \"People often hit the ground running after the long winter and want immediate results,\" says Pamela Randolph, PT, DPT, MBA, FACHE, Director of Rehabilitation Services at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton. \"They do too much too soon and end up injuring themselves.\" Golf is a common example where \"too much too soon\" can lead to problems. \"The golf swing involves rapid motion of the spine, hips and shoulders,\" YOUR BEST PERFORMANCE YET PAMELA RANDOLPH, PT, DPT, MBA, FACHE RAMP UP FOR SPRING ACTIVITY AND AVOID INJURY WITH THESE EXPERT STEPS.The season awaits: Bill Rue, former Chair, RWJUH Hamilton Board of Directors, tees up at the 2021 Foundation Golf Outing.

Allow your body to rest between bouts of an activity or the days on which you performed a specific exercise to let muscles recover and build strength or endurance. \"Vary your workouts so you don't do the same thing every time, which helps avoid overuse injuries,\" Dr. Randolph says. SEEK HELP FOR INJURIES \"If you feel any pain or something doesn't feel right, ease up on the activity,\" Stevens says. \"Don't assume pain will improve or won't get worse.\" It's a red flag if pain doesn't quit or keeps coming back. \"You need to determine why it continues,\" Stevens says. \"A mechanical issue may need to be corrected.\" In these cases, consider having a physician, physical therapist or athletic trainer evaluate you. Depending on the problem, rehabilitation such as skilled physical therapy may be a key to your recovery. \"RWJUH Hamilton offers physical therapy services at seven locations where we can help recondition you and make sure nothing serious is going on so you can be cleared to resume activity,\" Dr. Randolph says. EASE BACK FROM REHAB Make sure you go to all physical therapy appointments and follow through with prescribed exercises at home. \"Compliance is key,\" Stevens says. \"You might only see a physical therapist one to three times a week, so what you do outside of therapy is critically important in maintaining the progress you make during your session.\" Don't rush recovery, and follow physical therapists' advice on best exercises. \"Each physical therapy program is individual and tailored to the person and their needs,\" Dr. Randolph says. MAINTAIN HEALTHY HABITS Stick to healthy foods, but don't deny yourself less-than-perfect favorites in moderation. \"Talk to a dietitian for individual guidance based on your health history,\" Stevens says. \"Portion control may matter more than being super strict about what you're eating.\" Get ample sleep. \"If you're not recovering overnight, that can affect metabolism and your energy level during workouts,\" Stevens says. Boost your motivation to exercise by understanding why it's important to you\u2014whether your goal is to play with children, be more social or deal with a disease like diabetes. If motivation flags, find an activity you can share with other people. \"It's easier to do something you don't necessarily love when surrounded by people you enjoy who provide support or have a similar mission,\" Dr. Randolph says.

But you can be the best version of yourself on the links this year with help from a new program at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton. \"I have three major goals for participants,\" says Nick Cifelli, PT, DPT, CSCS, TPI, who conducts the program: \"Increase mobility and strength; increase swing speed, power and distance; and prevent injury.\" Dr. Cifelli is certified by the Titleist Performance Institute, which employs innovative technologies and a holistic approach to help golfers improve performance. \"The program uses a 16-point, head-to-toe screening to assess your ability to move and how it's linked to your swing,\" Dr. Cifelli says. Tests calculate swing speed with radar, analyze swings using motion-capture video and assess power by having you handle medicine balls and do jumps. Individualized programs help boost performance by improving a swing's force, distance and time. \"If you manipulate one, two or all three of those, you improve power,\" Dr. Cifelli says. \"Whether you want to reduce pain, improve your game, play longer or overall feel better, we can help you meet your goals.\" Nick Cifelli, PT, DPT, CSCS, TPI (right), is certified by the Titleist Performance Institute for a new golf program at RWJUH Hamilton. \"PEOPLE TEND TO THINK STATIC STRETCHING HELPS PREPARE FOR ACTIVITY, BUT YOU WANT MUSCLES TO BE ACTIVE, NOT RELAXED.
