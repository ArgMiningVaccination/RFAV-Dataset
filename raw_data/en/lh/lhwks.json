Although the treatment is different andtakes more time when compared to conventional western medicines, homeopathy medicines are quite effective for long-term cure. Also, homeopathy focuses on the entire body instead of treating only one part. It believes that all parts of a human body are connected, and hence, treating one part means treating the whole body. Considering the importance of homeopathy in the field of medicine, World Homeopathy Day is observed on 10th April every year in the memory of Dr Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy. The treatment is also covered under health insurance, so you need not worry about the expenses. Let's take a look at the many health benefits of homeopathy 1. Helps manage anxiety and depression: Poor mental health often leads to anxiety and depression and these can be difficult to deal with. While conventional medications can suppress the symptoms and help to a certain extent, they are addictive and create psychological dependence. However, homeopathy works differently. Instead of suppressing the symptoms, homeopathy focuses on healing the condition completely. Although this may take more time, it certainly proves to be beneficial in the long run. 2. Helps treat asthma: Asthma is a chronic condition in which the airways become inflamed and narrow. It also leads to excess mucous production, chest pain, breathing issues, cough and wheezing. While traditional medicines and inhalers can help, they must be used regularly or whenever one notices symptoms. On the other hand, homeopathy medicines can completely root out asthma if you take the prescribed ones as per the doctor's instructions. A homeopathic practitioner focuses on the cause of the condition and prescribes medicines to promote your body's ability to heal. 3. Helps chronic conditions: Chronic conditions can affect your quality of life and make things increasingly difficult as days pass by. Although traditional medicines can suppress the symptoms, they do not cure the condition completely. However, homeopathy addresses conditions at the root level and promotes healing. Before prescribing medicines, homeopathic practitioners askmultiple questions about the patient's lifestyle, medical conditions, behaviour and more, and then recommend medicines accordingly. Since the treatment of certain chronic conditions can be expensive, make sure you take health insurance to cover your medical bills. 4. Helps promote weight loss: If you are overweight, you can take the right homeopathy medicines and lose weight. However, homeopathy medicines are not like the typical weight loss pills. When you go to a homeopathic practitioner, they will consider different factors before prescribing the right medicines. For instance, the doctor will ask about your everyday diet, digestive health and emotional wellbeing as these factors can lead to weight gain. 5. Helps boost immunity: Homeopathy medicines are increasingly used by many to strengthen their immune system. Unlike the common immunity-boosting pills in allopathy, homeopathy has no generic medicines to boost immunity. When you meet a homeopathic practitioner, they will prescribe an individually selected medicine to strengthen your immune system. 6. Helps treat epidemic conditions: Homeopathy can effectively treat epidemic conditions as well. In fact, this form of treatment has been used since the time of Hahnemann. The founder of homeopathy reportedly used Belladonna to treat scarlet fever.Today, homeopathy is commonly used for certain endemic conditions, such as chickenpox, flu and viral fever. Conclusion Homeopathy is a simple and natural form of medicine that offers many health benefits. It is reportedly gentle and rarely causes any side effects. Hence, when prescribed by a qualified homeopathic doctor, the medicines can be taken by people of all ages.
