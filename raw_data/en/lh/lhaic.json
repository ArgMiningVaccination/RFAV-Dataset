Dougherty: A Pioneer in the Selection ofCaenorhabditis elegans as a Model Organism Howard Ferris*,1and W. F. Hieb *Department of Entomology and Nematology, University of California, Davis, California 95616, andCenter for Nutrition and Metabolism, Children 's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, California 94609 ABSTRACT Ellsworth Dougherty (1921 -1965) was a man of impressive intellectual dimensions and interests; in a relatively short career he contributed enormously as researcher and scholar to the biological knowledge base for selection of Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism in neurobiology, genetics, and molecular biology. He helped guide the choice of strains that were eventually used,and, in particular, he developed the methodology and understanding for the nutrition and axenic culture of nematodes and otherorganisms. Dougherty insisted upon a concise terminology for culture techniques and coined descriptive neologisms that were justi ed by their linguistic roots. Among other contributions, he re ned the classi cation system for 1) made signif- icant contributions to the foundations of the areas of science that would eventually evolve into molecular genet- ics, neurobiology, and the genome projects. The year 2015 isthe 50th anniversary of his death. Building on observationsand insights from as far back as the mid-19th century, theprimary core of Dougherty 's contributions to science was his recognition of the value of rhabditid nematodes, particularlyCaenorhabditis spp., as biological models for studies in ge- netics and many other aspects of biology. He emphasized the importance of culturing the nematodes in the absence of other organisms to facilitate appropriate studies. Those in-sights drove his intensive efforts to develop chemically de-ned media, and his collaborative studies on mutants and genetic recombination in nematodes. He reasoned that, ifthe phenotypic expressions of physiological and develop-mental mutations in multicellular organisms were to be un-derstood unequivocally, it would be necessary to remove or control all extrinsic sources of variability. Among other things, it would require explicit identi cation of the charac- teristics of the diet. That became the driving force of hisresearch for more than 20 years of his scienti c career and strongly in fluenced his students and colleagues. A brilliantman who apparently became depressed as a result of pro- fessional and personal disappointments, Dougherty ended his own life on December 21, 1965, at the age of 44. Personal History and Attributes Born July 21, 1921, Dougherty was raised and educated in Berkeley, California. Other than some international collab-orations such as a Guggenheim Memorial Fellow between 1947 and 1950, he spent his career in the San Francisco Bay area. Recognized by his peers as a genius who was deeplyinvested in the ideals of scholarship, Dougherty achieved hisAB degree in Zoology at age 18, PhD at age 22, and MD in1946 at age 25. His interests in nematodes and micro-metazoa were already evident when, at the age of 21, hebecame a member of the American Society of Parasitologistsand the Helminthological Society of Washington. At various times he was also a member of the European Society of Nematologists and the American Microscopical Society andwas a charter member of the Society of Nematologists(Corliss 1966; Hansen 1966). His PhD dissertation at theUniversity of California, Berkeley, was on the biology ofanimal-parasitic strongylid nematodes (Dougherty 1944). During his career, he was elected Fellow of the AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science and of the New York Academy of Sciences. Revered and admired by students, collaborators, and supporters, Dougherty was an \"out of the box \"thinker, pas- sionate about his science, and a person who did not always Copyright \u00a9 2015 by the Genetics Society of America doi: 10.1534/genetics.115.178913 1Corresponding author: Department of California 95616.

Ina tribute, parasitologist George Jackson (1966) wrote of theexperience of an interaction with Dougherty: Pinned down by the man 's eyes, you were told the comma, the colon, and the omission of your papers better than you could remember. You were dissected but not discarded. An exchange of letters followed, you reread his works, tookexception here and there, but were amazed at the morphology and biochemistry, classi of primitive organisms and humandisease. If the choices of his topics were diversi ed and skilled, so were his attacks as natural historian and exper- imental scientist, medical practitioner, scholar and teacher, neologist and author. A proli c correspondent, Dougherty 's archived les in- clude letters to B.G Chitwood, G. Osche, L.H. Hyman, E.W.Mayr, and other luminaries of the time challenging conceptsof evolutionary relationships among micrometazoa and onmatters of terminology. He corresponded with MauriceWilkins and Linus Pauling regarding his ideas on DNAreplication (Dougherty 1957 -1964, 1961). When more formal attire was appropriate in a profes- sional setting, Dougherty invariably sported a bow-tie. One of the unique activities of this interesting man on a personallevel was that, probably originating as a childhood fascina-tion, he amassed a large collection of rst editions of books by L. Frank Baum on the Wizard of Oz . Dougherty was an early member of the Wizard of Oz Club in San Francisco. Hecollected Baum books extensively in the 1950s and 1960s.After his death, his collection was sold successively among private collectors and nally donated to the University of San Francisco, where it is held in the Department of SpecialCollections at the Gleeson Library ( http://ozclub.org ). While working on his PhD at the University of California at Berkeley, he met his China-born wife, Ching-yi Dougherty,who was doing graduate work at Mills College in Oakland,California. The couple married in 1944, being forced totravel to Seattle, Washington, to marry because California still had anti-miscegenation la ws at that time. The Doughertys had one son, Brian Shao-lin, born in 1949. Ching-yi Doughertywent on to become Senior Lecturer of Mandarin Chinese atthe University of California at Santa Cruz. She retired in1981 and passed away October 13, 2009 at the age of 96(Van Den Abbeele 2009; http://news.ucsc.edu/2009/10/ 3317.html ). The Ching-Yi Dougherty Reading Room in the library at U.C. Santa Cruz is named in her honor. A student of languages \u2014French, German, Russian, Chi- nese, Japanese, Latin, and Greek \u2014Dougherty commented on and discussed with nomenclatorial commissions details of the names of species and higher taxa (Dougherty 1951c;Corliss and Dougherty 1955; Dougherty and Allen 1958),even challenging Chitwood (1957), through the Commis-sion on Zoological Nomenclature, on the use of the term\"nema \"(Dougherty 1958a,b). He was frustrated by the am- biguity of terms, such as \"pure culture \"and \"sterile media, \" used in the culture and maintenance of microorganisms. He introduced more speci c terms that became neologisms in general usage, often drawing on earlier literature. For ex-ample, the term \"axenic \"was used by Baker and Ferguson (1942) and \"gnotobiotic \"was introduced by Reyniers et al. (1949); Dougherty introduced xenic, monoxenic, dixenic,etc., as unambiguous descriptors of the numbers in gnotobiotic culture, and oligidic, holidic,and meridic as descriptors of the level of knowledge of the precise chemical constitution of the media (Dougherty 1953a, 1959, 1960; Corliss 1966). In dealing with the need to describe the structure of nuclei for his revision of the Protista, Dougherty drew onsome rather rare French publications that divided the groupinto the procaryotes (those without a de nite nucleus and individual mitochondria) and the eucaryotes (those witha nucleus and mitochondria) (Chatton 1925, 1937/1938; Lwoff 1932; Katscher 2004). Interestingly, one of the few copies of Chatton 's 1937/1938 book that exist worldwide is in the U.C. Berkeley library (Katscher 2004), but it is un-certain whether Dougherty used that particular volume asa reference source. He proposed the term \"prokaryon \"for bacterial nuclei not bound by a membrane and \"eukaryon \" for membrane-bound nuclei of other \"primitive \"organisms (Dougherty 1957). From that evolution of de nitions the terms \"prokaryote \"and \"eukaryote, \"originating with Chatton (1925), came into general use in modern biology. Professional Career The breadth of Dougherty 's interests in biology and medicine was vast. Coincident with his various research activities andappointments, between 1952 and 1961 he was a practicing physician in internal medicine with the Kaiser Permanente Medical Group in Oakland, California, with particular con-cern for the special problems of young people. He pursuedand obtained funding that would facilitate the achievementof his research passion. A cursory examination of his resumereveals a lack of permanence and a bewildering array offellowships, appointments, and af liations at least during the early part of his research career. From archived letters to granting agencies and colleagues, it is clear that he was frequently concerned about the availability and security offunding to support his research. At times he supported the Figure 1 Ellsworth C. Dougherty. 992 H. Ferris and W. F. Hiebwork with income derived from his appointment as a physi- cian (Dougherty 1957 -1964). The central locus of his career was always in and around the University of California at Berkeley. During a 1947 -1948 National Cancer Institute P ostdoctoral Fellowship, he worked in the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, which was directed by E. O. Lawrence, the 1939 Nobel Laureate inPhysics. As a result of that af liation, he appreciated the potential of radioisotopes and contributed extensively toan early text (Dougherty 1949). Between 1947 and 1949on a Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship, he was associatedwith colleagues at the Universities of Paris and Lyon and theKerckhoff Laboratories of Biology of the California Institute of Technology. Later, he negotiated with directors of the Radiation Laboratory at U.C. Berkeley for access to an un-used structure, the old goat barn in Strawberry Canyon, anarea later developed into athletic facilities, where he estab-lished a laboratory for his work on nematode nutrition. In 1957 he established the Laboratory of Comparative Biology, which was the founding unit of the Kaiser Founda-tion Research Institute, in Richmond, California, and was the director of that institute between 1957 and 1962 (Cushing 2012). During that period he collaborated withMary Bell Allen on pigmentation and the biochemistry ofalgae (Dougherty and Allen 1956, 1958; Dougherty et al. 1957; Allen et al. 1959). Interestingly, in 1958 he invited B. G. Chitwood, another genius scholar of the micrometazoa,particularly nematodes, to join the institute as a consultant biologist, Chitwood was at the Institute for 3 years, and it was surely a time during which intellects clashed and sparks flew (Taylor and Esser 1972; Thorne 1972)! Dougherty 'ss e p - aration from the Kaiser Foundation Research Institute was notcordial, and it became necessa ry for communication with for- mer administrators and colleagues to be conducted throughintermediaries (Dougherty 1957 -1964). Sponsored by the National Science Foundation in collab- oration with the U.S. Antarctic Research Program, Dougherty participated in three expeditions to McMurdo Sound, Antarc- tica, in 1959 -1960 and 1960 -1961 to study biodiversity of the microfauna of the Taylor Dry Valley and other areas.Microfaunae of several freshwater environments were sur-veyed, and species of nematodes, rotifers, tardigrades, andcollembolan were documented ( e.g., Dougherty et al. 1960; Dougherty and Harris 1963). The study extended into thesuccessful culture and determination of the nutritional requirements of Antarctic organisms (Dougherty 1964a,b). Commemorating his contributions to the success of thoseexpeditions, Mount Dougherty, a 2789-m peak at latitude282.717, longitude 161.083 in the Queen Elizabeth Range of Antarctica, was named for him ( http://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Mount_Dougherty ). Across the years, Dougherty was sequentially associated with departments of the U.C. Berkeley: Zoology, Physiology, and Medical Physics and, between 1961 and 1965, with Nutritional Sciences. In his Curriculum Vitae documentdated May 25, 1964, he indicated that he had held theposition of Specialist in Nu trition since 1961 and Lec- turer in Nutrition since 1962 in the Department of Nutri-tional Sciences at U.C. Berkeley. Both were nontenure-trackpositions (Dougherty 1964c). Recorded memory differs ondetails of those appointments prior to his death. One version suggests that differences of opinion among factions of the faculty resulted in loss of his position and contributed tohis depression and, ultimately, his suicide (Nicholas 1984;Brown 2003). However, in the introduction of his disserta-tion, W.F.H., Dougherty 's last graduate student indicated that at the time of his death Dougherty held the positionof Director of the Laboratory of Comparative Nutrition in theDepartment of Nutritional Sciences (Hieb 1971). Also, W.F.H. recalls some disagreement in the Nutritional Sciences Depart- ment about the focus on nutritional requirements of an in-vertebrate model system. A Brief History of Research on Nematode Genetics Ideas on the potential of nematodes for use in geneticsresearch were not original or unique to Dougherty, Nigon, and their colleagues. As is common in the evolution of knowledge, the progression of \"standing on the shoulders of giants \"applies here because ideas regarding the use of nem- atodes as model organisms for studying genetics, embryol-ogy, and development were evolving much earlier. Theinvestigations of Theodor and Marcella Boveri on the fertil-ization, cell division, and early embryonic development ofhorse ascarids (Boveri 1888, 1895) led to the chromosome theory of heredity (Satzinger 2008). The Boveris had built on the pioneering work of Van Beneden and colleagues onthe embryology , extensively by Schneider (1866), \u00d6rley (1886),and others. The embryological stages and fate of the threegerm layers in rhabditid nematodes were described at theend of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries by Goette (1882), Ziegler (1895), and Neuhaus (1903); post- embryonic growth and molting were studied by Maupas(1899). German and French workers continued to makemajor contributions. Early research on the reproductivestrategies, cytogenetics, and embryonic and post-embryonicdevelopment of (1922), Belar (1924), Honda (1925), 1946, 1949; Nigon and Dougherty 1949a,b; Nigon and Brun 1955) studied the hermaphroditic and sexual forms of re-productive biology of the rhabditids, which were to be im-portant characteristics in the selection of these organisms asbiological models. T h eb i o l o g y ,l i f eh i s t o r y ,e c o l o g y ,t a x o n o m y ,a n ds y s t e m a t i c s of the rhabditid nematodes had been progressively docu-mented by Reiter (1928) and, more recently, by Sudhaus (1976) and Andr\u00e1ssy (1983). Schneider (1866) reported the existence of a life stage with a cuticle differing from that inother stages; he considered this form to be a molting stage Perspectives 993but was uncertain of its role. According to Maupas (1899), P\u00e9rez (1866) recognized an \"encysted and indicated that larvae easily encysted at the end of the second stage. Experimentally, Maupas (1899) deter-mined that it was always the same life stage that entered encystment when nutrients were lacking. He noted that encysted nematodes survive for weeks and are often a dis-persal stage; he showed that emergence from the encystedstage occurred following nutrient enrichment. Later, Fuchs(1915), in his description of rhabditids associated with barkbeetles, coined the term \"dauerlarva \"for this persistent or enduring \"encysted \"stage. Contributions of Dougherty Dougherty was a visionary and a proli c researcher. Much of his early research with nematodes, before he focused onaxenic culture and nutritional requirements of bacteria-feeding forms, was on the taxonomy of animal parasiticspecies. Early in his career he met George Beadle andEdward Tatum and was intrigued by their work on the biochemical genetics of Neurospora and the one gene -one enzyme hypothesis. Recognizing the potential of applyingthe advances in biochemical genetics to the micrometazoa,particularly the Nematoda, the rationale for his goal ofdeveloping chemically de ned media was that such tech- niques would be invaluable in understanding the physio-logical and developmental phenotypes of mutants andultimately in understanding th eir genetic basis. Progress through many years of research in his laboratory was pub- lished as abstracts of reports given at scienti c meetings of many of the professional societies to which he and hiscolleagues belonged ( e.g., Dougherty and Keith 1951; Dougherty and Hansen 1956a,b), in short papers in Sci- ence and Nature (Dougherty 1950, 1951a), or in more extensive reports as the work developed ( e.g.,D o u g h e r t y et al. 1950; Dougherty 1951b, 1953b; Dougherty and Keith 1953; Dougherty and Hansen 1956c, 1957a,b; Hansen and Dougherty 1957). Progress of his work andthat of others in the e l do fn u t r i t i o na n dc u l t u r eo fm i c r o - m e t a z o aw a sc o l l a t e di nd e t a i li ne x t e n s i v ep r o c e e d i n g so fsymposia that he organized (Dougherty et al. 1959, 1963; Nicholas et al. 1959). Essentially, Dougherty was in the right place at the right time to recognize and communicate the potential of rhabdi- tid nematodes, including those that would become classi ed asCaenorhabditis spp., in evolving elds of biology. The combination of his foresight, enthusiasm, and passion casthim among the catalysts for selection of the model organismto be used in the many studies and advances that followed.Both Chandler (1924) and Dotterweich (1938) had recog-nized the potential of rhabditid nematodes as candidates forstudies in genetics. The attributes of this group of nematodes as models for the evolution of modern genetics were devel- oped and summarized in a letter to Nature by Dougherty and Calhoun (1948b) several years prior to the description of thestructure of DNA (Crick and Watson 1953) and before the subsequent evolution of molecular genetics and molecularbiology generally (Figure 2). The insights in the letter werereinforced by the work of Nigon and Dougherty (1949a,b) andof Nigon on modes of reproduction in free-living nematodes (Nigon 1949). The important characteristics of rhabditid nematodes listed by Dougherty and Calhoun (1948b) include thefollowing: 1. Easily cultivated on nutrient agar in the presence of bac- teria as a resource; 2. Small size, short life cycle;3. Relative constancy of a few hundred somatic nuclei allowing determination of the effects of mutations atthe cellular level; 4. Few chromosomes and diverse sex patterns that offer a wide range of opportunities for detection, manipula- tion, and study of mutations, for example: (a) some spe-cies dioecious with similar numbers of females andmales, others hermaphroditic with few males and yetothers parthenogenic; (b) hermaphrodites with XX andmales XO chromosome complements; 5. The potential for culture in chemically de ned media that would provide the opportunity to study physiological mutants. Research on Caenorhabditis elegans and Other Nematodes Dougherty 's direct involvement and contribution to the sub- sequent advances in neurobiology and developmental biology,particularly the future work centered on Caenorhabditis elegans , was fueled by the fortuitous discovery of a rhabditid nematode on the campus of Stanford University in Palo Alto,California, by Margaret Briggs Gochnauer, in 1944. Gochnauerused the nematode, which she identi ed as Rhabditis sp., in her MS studies of its lifecycle in association with bacteria and in various culture media devoid of other organisms(Briggs 1946). She went on to use this species in studieson the effects of antibiotics (Gochnauer and McCoy 1954),which later became relevant in the development of axenicculture methods. Dougherty had actually begun to work on nematode nutrition with the sexually reproducing Rhabditis pellio (Dougherty and Calhoun 1948a). When he became aware that the nematode studied by Margaret Briggs Gochnauerwas a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite, he realized that theimpact of variability resulting from genetic recombinationwould be reduced by such a genetic system, so he switchedhis studies to that species. Briggs (1946) reported that thenematode could not be sustained in the absence of bacteriaor even on dead bacterial cells; living bacteria were a neces- sary food source. However, survival of individuals was greater on some bacteria-free media than on others. BriggsGochnauer had attempted to culture the nematode on 12 994 H. Ferris and W. F. HiebGram-negative and 10 Gram-positive bacteria. Six of the Gram-negative but only one of the Gram-positive bacteriasupported the nematode in monoxenic culture (Briggs1946). Dougherty wondered about the differences amongthese bacteria. Later, Dougherty and Victor Nigon described the nematode used by Briggs Gochnauer as Rhabditis briggsae (Dougherty and Nigon 1949). A related species was earlier described andnamed Rhabditis elegans by Maupas (1900) who collected it from rich humus soil in Algeria (Fatt 1961); the two specieswere subsequently placed in the subgenus Caenorhabditis by Osche (1952). The subgenus was elevated to genus rank byDougherty (1955a); its name is a blend of Greek and Latin (Caeno , recent; rhabditis ,r o d ;t h es p e c i cn a m e elegans is derived from elegant). Dougherty 's collaboration with Nigon under the auspices of his Guggenheim Fellowship at theUniversity of Paris and later at the University of Lyon wasan important period in creating the groundwork for Caeno- rhabditis as a model system. The collaboration of Dougherty and Nigon led to further understanding of the reproductionpatterns of Rhabditidae; their work included experiments attempting to hybridize C. briggsae and C. elegans and the discovery of a dwarf mutant form of C. briggsae (Nigon and Dougherty 1950a,b). Two strains of C. elegans were used in the early studies. The Bergerac strain was collected in March 1944 by VictorNigon from the garden of his home in Bergerac in the south-west of France. The following month he took the nematodesto the University of Paris where he re-initiated his thesis research that had been interrupted by the war (M.-A. F\u00e9lix, personal communication). Nigon identi ed the nematode as R. elegans in that it conformed to the original description by Maupas (1900) (Nigon 1949; Riddle et al. 1997). The Bergerac strain was used in the studies by Nigon and his colleaguesand students in France (Nigon and Dougherty 1949a,b;Nigon and Brun 1955; Dion and Brun 1971). The Bristolstrain was isolated from mushroom compost near Bristol, England, and was used in a short course on agricultural nematology taught in 1956 by L. N. Staniland of the NationalAgricultural Advisory Service, London (Nicholas et al. 1959; Nicholas 1984). Staniland was an applied nematologist; hepublished extensively on the nature and control of a varietyof nematode problems between 1926 and 1967, includingdamage associated with rhabditid swarming in mushroombeds. The Bristol strain has been the most important in the explosion of activity on C. elegans in molecular genetics and developmental biology. Warwick Nicholas was Lecturer in the Department of Zoology at the University of Liverpool from 1955 until 1960.In 1957 and 1958 he was on leave as a Traveling Fellow ofthe British Medical Research Council (MRC) funded bya Rockefeller grant. During the tenure of the fellowship, heworked with Dougherty and Eder Hansen in the Laboratory of Comparative Biology, a part of the Kaiser Foundation Research Institute at U.C. Berkeley. Nicholas took the Bristolstrain of C. elegans with him to California where Doughertyhad previously obtained the Bergerac strain from Nigon. Both strains were established by Nicholas in monoxenic cul-ture on nutrient agar with Escherichia coli as a food source in Dougherty 's laboratory in 1957 (Nicholas and McEntegart 1957; Nicholas et al. 1959; Dougherty 1960; Fatt 1961). In unsuccessful attempts to between ele- gans andC. briggsae , Nigon (1949) and Nigon (1949a,b) discovered that greater proportions of males wereproduced at elevated temperatures but that the fertility ofmales produced at higher temperatures was decreased. TheBergerac strain of C. elegans becomes infertile at temperatures above 18 /C176while the Bristol strain can be cultured at temper- atures up to 25 /C176, although males will not copulate below 20 /C176 (Fatt and Dougherty 1963; Nicholas 1984). In perhaps the rst study in the Nematoda of the genetics of a physiological character, Dougherty 's student, Helene Fatt, conducted mat- ing experiments between males and hermaphrodites of the Bergerac and Bristol strains of C. elegans . From their initial studies, they concluded that t he heat sensitivity gene seg- regated as a simple Mendelian recessive and that it wasautosomal rather than sex-linked, but their later research indicated that at least thre e genes are involved (Fatt, 1961, 1966, 1967; Fatt and Dougherty 1963). Those experimentsprovided a valuable example of the potential for genetics studies with the nematode. During the early nutrition and neurobiology work in several laboratories, there was confusion and mis-identi cation of cultures of C. briggsae and C. elegans . The two species are distinguished morphologically by the pattern of rays in the male bursa, but this is a dif cult character to use in organisms in which males are rare. In the mid-1970s,graduate student Paul Friedman at U.C. Riverside, after get-ting inconsistent results while testing antibiotics on C. briggsae and C. elegans , developed the diagnostic criteria based on isozyme electrophoresis for separating the two species(Friedman et al. 1977). The combination of Brenner 's (1974) paper on the genetics of C. elegans and the mis- identi cation of cultures resulted in many laboratories restricting their studies to C. elegans (Riddle et al. 1997). Linkages and Connections Consider the chain of events associated with the Dougherty - Nicholas -Brenner conduit of information, ideas, and cul- tures that was facilitated by the Traveling Fellow Rockefeller grant to Nicholas. Sydney Brenner was the mover and shaker at the MRC unit for research on the Molecular Struc-ture of Biological Systems at Cambridge, UK, and was de-bating the next steps in translating the successes of Watsonand Crick into a greater understanding of \"life. \"In 1954, Brenner visited U.C. Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology ( http://library.cshl. edu/personal-collections/sydney-brenner ). It is not known by the authors if he became acquainted with the nematode work during those visits, but it is at least an interesting co-incidence that Dougherty had current or recent af liations Perspectives 995with both institutions at that time. Based on the work of Dougherty, Nigon, and their colleagues, Brenner initiallyproposed to use C. briggsae as his model organism and in- dicated that in his proposal to the MRC in 1963 (Brenner1988). He established cultures of nematodes from his owngarden and from soil samples collected by colleagues. One of those cultures, established with nematodes collected froma compost heap in June 1964, was designated N1 (whereNi n d i c a t e s \"Nematode \"). The culture of N1 was not a Caenorhabditis but was identi ed as Mesodiplogaster lheritieri Figure 2 The letter to the jour- nal Nature by Dougherty and Calhoun (1948b) detailing the potential for use of rhabditidnematodes in genetics research.Note that the letter predates the erection of the subgenus Caeno- rhabditis by Osche (1952) and its elevation to genus level by Dougherty (1955a).

After discussions with Dougherty during a visit to U.C. Berkeley,Brenner switched his interest from C. briggsae toC. elegans (Brenner 1974; Riddle et al. 1997; Brown 2003). In a letter to Dougherty dated October 11, 1963, Brenner requested a culture of C. elegans .T h ec u l t u r eo ft h eB r i s t o ls t r a i n , originally collected by Staniland, which Dougherty sent toBrenner was designated N2 (Ankeny 2001; Friedberg 2010)(Figure 3). for the switch from C. briggsae toC. elegans are now somewhat obscure, but perhaps the most appealingis Brenner 's reported quip that he considered C. elegans to be more photogenic (Davies 2002). More likely is that Dougherty pointed out differences in the growth rates of the two species (F\u00e9lix 2008) and possibly the advanta-geous behavioral attributes of the Bristol strain of C. ele- gans , which were later associated with the npr-1 gene. Individuals with the npr-1 gene do not clump or burrow into an agar medium, thus greatly facilitating microscopicobservation of behavioral and developmental phenomena.Since the gene does not occur in C. elegans populations isolated in nature, it is possible the npr-1 is a spontane- ous mutation that occurred during prolonged culture inDougherty 's laboratory (McGrath et al. 2009). Virtually all the studies on C. elegans genetics and development have been done with the N2 Bristol strain that SydneyBrenner established from the culture he obtained fromEllsworth Dougherty. The impo rtance of the early studies by Dougherty and colleagues is recognized in Brenner 's landmark paper (Brenner 1974). In association with the early realizations of the scienti c value of nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis , Dougherty set out to develop a chemically de ned culture medium (Dougherty and Calhoun 1948b; Nicholas 1984). In studiesdecades earlier, Conte (1900), Reiter (1928) and Clapham(1930) had shown that the morphometrics of these nematodeswere affected by the nutritional nature of the culture medium. Through myriad experiments, Dougherty and colleagues developed a chemically de ned medium composed of 19 essential and nonessential amino acids, 13 vitamins, sixgrowth factors, ve nucleotides, nine salts, and glucose as an energy source (Buecher et al. 1966; Hieb 1971). How- ever, the medium would not support reproduction ofC. briggsae without small additional amounts of substances of unde ned chemical characteristics as supplied, for exam- ple, by chick embryo, liver proteins, and human plasma (Dougherty et al. 1959; Nicholas et al. 1959; Sayre et al. 1963; Hieb 1971). Determination of the chemical identity of the nal necessary components proved dif cult (Nicholas 1984). Af- ter Dougherty 's death, the work on nutritional requirements ofC. briggsae , and eventually on other nematode species, was continued by various colleagues, their students, and as- sociates (Hansen and Berntzen 1969; Buecher et al. 1970; 1977).

The unde ned components of the me- dium were determined to be an iron porphyrin and a sterol.T h ei r o np o r p h y r i nc o u l db es u p p l i e db ye i t h e rah e m eprotein or unbound hemin and Nicholas 1984). One of Dougherty 'sl a s t publications was as co-author of an abstract with W.F.H.(Hieb and Dougherty 1966), who attempted to counselhim through his descent into depression. Dougherty sawW.F.H. as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who would carry on the nutritionwork. Although nematodes can be successfully cultured on various formulations of an axenic holidic diet, populations grow rather slowly and their maintenance in monoxeniccultures with E. coli cultures is usually preferred and has been used in most C. elegans research (Stiernagle 1999). The cul- ture of rhabditid nematodes has continued to be of interestand importance with the evolution of the commercial appli-cation of the genera Heterorhabditis and Steinernema as bi- ological control agents of insect pests. Interestingly , when produced in axenic culture, these nematodes are generally less infective of their insect prey than when produced inmonoxenic culture (Ehlers et al. 1997), and sophisticated mon- oxenic bioreactor systems have been developed (Chavarr\u00eda-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. 2011). However, the conventional wisdom is that nematodes are the only animals for which there isa totally synthetic de ned medium in which they are able to reproduce continuously. Dougherty 's experiences while working on the pigmenta- tion and biochemistry of algae led to a proposal for a phy-logeny of the Protista that included the Monera (bacteriaand blue-green algae), Mesoprotista and Meta-protista (eukaryotic algae, fungi, and Protozoa) (Doughertyand Allen (1960). He also explored his interests in the evo-lution of sexual reproduction and suggested that the Protistashould be an important group for determining its origins (Dougherty 1955b, 1956). Dougherty corresponded exten- sively with 1955 Nobel Laureate Joshua Lederberg, acontemporary and Tatum. The preserved corre-spondence ( http://pro les.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Series/ 735) includes letters in which Dougherty inquired about mechanisms of genetic recombination among bacteria, par-ticularly E. coli ,a n de x p l a i n e dh i so w no b s e r v a t i o n sa n d ideas. Lederberg invited Dougherty to spend a month in his laboratory at the University of Wisconsin to further discuss the ideas and approaches to testing them. Doughertyresponded to the invitation by explaining that he had usedup all his vacation time, had no funding, and was support-ing his research on salary from his \"day job \"as a Kaiser Permanente physician! He published his hypotheses and observations on the origin of sexuality during thesame period (Dougherty 195 5b, 1956). During the latter part of his career, Dougherty expanded his work on nutri- tion and culture to other organisms, including Rotifera,Tardigrada, Turbellaria, and Perspectives 997enchytraeid annelids (Dougherty 1957 -1964; Dougherty et al. 1963). Impacts on Biological Research The characteristics of rhabditid nematodes, as pointed out by Dougherty and Calhoun (1948b) (Figure 2), and byothers both earlier and later, were substantiated and provedinvaluable in the work of Brenner, his colleagues, and suc-cessors. The MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cam-bridge, UK, and the establishment of the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center at the University of Missouri in Columbia provided loci for the interaction and productivity of myriadworm specialists, many of whom probably knew nothing of Dougherty. Their activities contributed to the detailed doc-umentation of many aspects of the biology and behavior of C. elegans . The nematode was the rst multicellular organ- ism to have its genome fully sequenced, and the success ofthat genome project greatly in fluenced interest, attention, funding, and understanding of the potential of the humangenome project (Lewin 1990; C. elegans Sequencing Consortium 1998; the genomesequence of C. briggsae , the nematode found by Margaret Briggs Gochnauer, described by Dougherty and Nigon, and used by Dougherty for nutritional studies, was also com- pleted (Stein et al. 2003). Through studies of the life history Figure 3 A letter from Dough- erty to Brenner accompanying the requested axenic culture of the Bristol strain of C. elegans (Wellcome Library; original heldby Cold Spring Harbor Labora- tory Archives and Genentech Center for the History of Molec-ular Biology and Biotechnology).

Hieband habits of Caenorhabditis in nature has come the under- standing that these nematodes are rarely found in soil butrather are inhabitants of decaying fruits and other vegeta-tion and are often dispersed by snails (F\u00e9lix and Braendle2010; Kiontke et al. 2011). Recognition of the association with decaying vegetation has led to the recent description of 16 new species in the genus on the basis of combinations ofmating, morphological and molecular evidence, and thenaming of a species discovered in rotting fruit in Kerala,India, as C. doughertyi (F\u00e9lix et al. 2014). The successes associated with the selection of C. elegans as a model system have resulted from a combination of de-sign and luck (Hodgkin 1989), but many of the attributes that have been important are among those rst detailed by Dougherty and Calhoun (1948b). Among the attributes arethat the nematode is small, anatomically simple, easy toculture, and easy to manipulate genetically because of itsreproductive strategies and that it has the full range of dif-ferentiated cell types of more complex organisms. The ge-nome is the smallest of those known for the Metazoa, whichfacilitated construction of its complete physical map (Sulston and Brenner 1974; Coulson et al. 1988). The nematode is viable after storage in liquid nitrogen, which permits preser-vation of the pedigree parentage of any mutant line; it isamenable to electron has transparent permit high-resolution Nomarski microscopy ofliving individuals. Finally , there was important backgroundknowledge available from the work of Dougherty , Nigon,and others that facilitated selection of C. elegans above other candidate organisms and accelerated Brenner 's (1974) devel- opment and description of morphological and behavioral mutantlines (Hodgkin 1989). Consider the linkages and connections in and after Dough- erty 's rather short career. His thin king and research activities were variously in fluenced by his meeting and interaction with four Nobel Laureates \u2014E.O. Lawrence, G.W. Beadle, E.L. Tatum, and J. Lederberg. Subsequently, his work and insights directly in fluenced the science of three other Nobel Laureates and, less directly, two others who worked on or withC. elegans : the 2002 prize in Physiology and Medicine of J.E. Sulston, H.R. Horvitz, and S. Brenner; the 2006 prize in Phys-iology and Medicine of A.Z. Fire and C.C. Mello and 2008prize in Chemistry of M.L. Chal e(http://www.nobelprize. org/nobel_prizes/lists/all/index.html ). Major advances in our understanding of living systems have resulted from the eld of science in which Dougherty so insightfully participated; important applications in medicine are continuing to emerge. Final Thoughts There are few remaining who have living memory ofEllsworth Dougherty. Although intrigued by the nature,activities, and contributions of the man, H.F. never met him. Their careers overlapped by only a few years. W.F.H. provided a wonderful direct link to the history but, even forhim, some details have faded. Every stone turned over inresearching this article revealed fascinating information, both direct and tangential to the theme; many led to otherstones to turn over, always with recognition of the constraintof maintaining focus. We hope that, whatever the gaps maybe, our account will revive recognition of the work of this now largely forgotten pioneer. Literature Cited Allen, M. B., E. C. Dougherty, and J. J. A.
