New technologies and investments are expanding access to childhood vaccines, bednets, and other lifesaving interventions, driving steep declines in child mortality. Promising new vaccines and therapies for diarrheal disease, malaria, pneumonia, and other health threats have the potential to increase both life expectancy and quality of life. Mobile technology has reached the most remote corners of the globe, revolutionizing everything from health education to vaccine stock management. PATH is harnessing the power of these innovations in pursuit of a bold ambition: to redefine the boundaries of what is possible in global health. Our vision is unwavering\u2014a world where innovation ensures that health is within reach for everyone. Our strategy is dynamic, channeling the tremendous potential of inventive ideas, new resources, groundbreaking collaborations, and cutting-edge discoveries into better health and opportunity for all. This is innovation in motion. Driving transformative innovation From pioneering research to proven, on-the-ground delivery strategies, we accelerate smart ideas and bring lifesaving innovations to scale, connecting evidence-based solutions with the tens of millions of people who have the fewest resources and the greatest need. We work in more than 70 countries and across nearly 200 projects to drive fresh thinking and new approaches to health technologies and systems, commercial markets, and community engagement. Our \"innovation pipeline\" of nearly 200 technologies and products accelerates the best ideas from prototype, testing, and validation to pilot introduction and national scale-up. In these pages, you'll learn about some of our most compelling accomplishments of 2012 that directly or indirectly touched the lives of more than 118 million people. These milestones include work to advance new vaccine and drug candidates for diarrheal disease, pneumococcal disease, and malaria; prevent HIV infection, cervical cancer, and meningitis A; and expand access to new contraceptive options and safe water.Innovation in motion From PATH's president and board chair Steve Davis President and CEO Molly Joel Coye, MD, MPH Chair, Board of DirectorsDirectly or indirectly benefitting from our work118 million people $313 million PATH's 2012 revenue1,100+ Number of PATH staff 192Technologies and products in our innovation pipeline 47,000 145Policies, strategies, and guidelines we worked to influence across 46 countriesHealth care providers, policymakers, advocates, and others we trained2012 PATH by the numbersAccelerating our impact PATH draws strength from our heritage of innovation and our proven track record of delivering high-impact tools, technologies, and strategies to transform global health.

Our work is fueled by nearly 1,800 individual donors, foundations, corporations, and institutions\u2014key collaborators in our work to turn bright ideas into breakthrough solutions. We are profoundly grateful for this support. With our diverse network of partners, PATH is driving innovation that saves lives through far-reaching, long-lasting health solutions for families and communities. With your continuing support and collaboration, we will transform lives and open the doors of opportunity to new generations. Thank you for your commitment to global health. Steve Davis President and CEOMolly Joel Coye, MD, MPH Chair, Board of Directors TAKING ON TOP CHILDHOOD KILLERS Helped 14 countries introduce rotavirus or pneumococcal vaccines. Advanced a vaccine candidate to protect kids from pneumococcal disease. Helped 15,000 Cambodian families use microloans to buy water filters.In 2012, PATH and our partners:DIARRHEAL DISEASE/ PNEUMONIA2012 milestones Getting vaccines from the manufacturer to a child's arm Achieving universal access to vaccines for pneumonia, diarrheal disease, and other health threats demands a smart and efficient supply chain to manage, store, and deliver vaccine supplies. Through project Optimize, a partnership between WHO and PATH, we worked to design and test solutions that ensure lifesaving vaccines find their way to the children who need them most, including more efficient vaccine packaging and labeling, streamlined supply chain design, and improved cold chain equipment. Two examples of our work follow. Boosting on-time vaccination In Vietnam, on-time vaccination rates increased markedly following a pilot project that introduced a digital immunization registry to track children due for vaccination. Our software program reduced the time health workers spent recording immunization data by hand and sent text message reminders to mothers when their children were due for shots. Better vaccine stock management In South Sudan, we tested a cloud-based logistics management system that uses mobile phones to manage vaccine stocks. County stock managers replaced paper-based records with mobile phones to register vaccine stock transactions and submit restocking orders. National and state managers used real-time data to track supply and demand and make ordering and delivery decisions. We also explored the use of battery-free vaccine refrigerators and hybrid solar-electric systems to maintain the cold chain in rural health outposts, and electric vehicles and specially equipped trucks to streamline vaccine delivery. The projects helped build the evidence base for global vaccine supply innovations, with some now poised for national expansion. Key partners: Government of the Republic of South Sudan; Logistimo; Vietnam's National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, National Expanded Programme on Immunization; UNICEF; WHO. Key funder: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Technology innovations Photos (previous and right) PATH/Eric BeckerHistoric dual vaccine launches in Africa Ghana and Tanzania made history by introducing both pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines, the first time two vaccines have been introduced simultaneously into the national immunization programs of countries eligible for support from the GAVI Alliance. PATH helped highlight these landmark introductions by documenting preparations, providing advocacy and communications support, and managing global media coverage of the launches. We also promoted Malawi's introduction of rotavirus vaccines. A PATH-designed strategic vaccine forecasting platform is now used by GAVI to predict supply and demand and improve vaccine introduction and distribution. Key partners: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Johns Hopkins University; ROTA Council; UNICEF; World Health Organization (WHO). Key funder: The GAVI Alliance.Stopping a deadly threat The completion of a phase 1 trial of a whole- cell vaccine candidate against the most common cause of severe pneumonia yielded promising results that support continuing clinical development, with additional research planned in Kenya. If successful, this vaccine would provide broad, affordable protection against pneumococcal disease for children in the developing world. Key partner: Boston Children's Hospital. Key funder: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.Two-in-one approach saves lives Our trailblazing work in Cambodia on an integrated approach to treat diarrheal disease and pneumonia yielded such convincing results that the country is fast-forwarding to national scale-up, with plans to reach more than 1.6 million children by 2014. In the rural district where we launched a pilot project, cases dropped dramatically after we trained health workers and parents to recognize and treat both health threats. Contributions from individual PATH supporters played a pivotal role in helping us expand this promising approach. Key partners: Cambodia Ministry of Health; National ARI-CDD Program of the National Maternal and Child Health Centre; UNICEF. Key funders: UNICEF; individual contributors.A new drug to beat diarrhea Our investigational new drug to treat acute secretory diarrhea will proceed into the next round of studies in Bangladesh following the successful completion of two phase 1 clinical studies in the United States. The drug could become the first synthetic drug of its kind to reduce fluid loss, shortening both the duration and severity of symptoms. Key partner: BioFocus. Key funder: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Community access to zinc Families in Kenya now have over-the-counter access to zinc, which can cut the duration and severity of diarrhea. We are working with provincial and district leaders to ensure this national policy change translates into broader community access and fewer deaths. Key partner: Kenya's Division of Child and Adolescent Health. Key funder: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.User-friendly water filters If everyone had access to safe water and basic sanitation services and hygiene practices, almost 90% of diarrheal deaths could be prevented. To reach families with safe water, PATH developed design guidelines now being used by three Chinese manufacturers selling low-cost household water filters and compatible filter elements. Using creative, market-based strategies that include microfinance loans and commercial partnerships, we have helped bring safe drinking water to hundreds of thousands of low-income consumers in Asia and Africa. Key partners: Melinda Gates Foundation; Laird Norton Family Foundation; individual contributors.Pneumonia and diarrhea are leading killers of the world's children, jointly responsible for nearly one-third of all child deaths before five years of age and claiming about 2 million lives annually. PATH tackles both threats with a coordinated strategy that brings together vaccine research and introduction, drug development, and innovative approaches to prevention and treatment, including expanding access to safe drinking water.WHEN FAMILIES ARE HEALTHY, COMMUNITIES ARE, TOO.FAMILY HEALTH2012 milestones Vaccinated 48 million+ people against meningitis A. Pledged to deliver up to 12 million doses of an injectable contraceptive for women over four years. Reached 200,000 children with nutritionally enhanced Ultra Rice\u00ae grains.In 2012, PATH and our partners: Accurate diagnosis to ensure the right treatment Technology innovations Effective treatment for illness and disease starts with an accurate diagnosis\u2014a difficult task in low-income settings where high- tech labs, reliable electricity, and specialized training often are not available. PATH works to accelerate and introduce affordable, easy-to- use diagnostic technology and screening tests to deliver fast and accurate results in detecting cancer, diabetes, and infectious diseases. Screening for cervical cancer The care HPV test, which detects the primary cause of cervical cancer, is now on sale in China and will soon be available in India and other countries. The test was developed by PATH and QIAGEN for use in even basic health clinics and can be used on vaginal samples self- collected by women without a pelvic exam. The test gives low-resource countries a new, cost- effective way to launch cervical cancer screening and treatment programs. Detecting diabetes Half of people with diabetes don't know it, and many of them are in developing countries. PATH is working in Cambodia, India, Mexico, and Tanzania to evaluate new technologies and screening strategies to identify and treat people with the disease, including a rapid diagnostic test to screen pregnant women for gestational diabetes that does not require fasting. Private support helped advance our work through field studies of promising diabetes screening products. In Cambodia, we are assessing a program that relies on peer educators to deliver low-cost, sustainable diabetes screening and care services. Our work in diagnostics also includes developing or advancing affordable tests for the rapid detection of HIV, malaria, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), and neglected tropical diseases. Key partners: Instituto P\u00fablica; Madras Diabetes Research Foundation; MoPoTsyo; QIAGEN, Inc.; University of Washington Department of Laboratory Medicine. Key funders: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Department of Biotechnology, India; Medtronic Foundation; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering; USAID; individual contributors.Ten nations, 100 million+ protected More than 100 million people across ten African countries have now received the lifesaving protection of a new vaccine against deadly meningitis A, with 48 million vaccinated in 2012 alone. The MenAfriVac\u00ae vaccine was developed through a partnership between PATH and WHO, in collaboration with Serum Institute of India Ltd. The vaccine also became the first in Africa approved for transport and storage outside the traditional cold chain, helping health workers reach people in remote areas. Key partners: Serum Institute of India Ltd.; WHO; ministries of health in Africa; three dozen global collaborators. Key funders: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Michael & Susan Dell Foundation; individual contributors. New contraceptive tool for women An estimated 215 million women worldwide want to prevent pregnancy but do not use or have access to modern methods of family planning. PATH is paving the way to introduce a new contraceptive option for women\u2014a popular injectable contraceptive adapted for delivery in the Uniject injection system developed by PATH. The medication is contained in a prefilled plastic bubble for easy delivery, potentially expanding the cadre of health workers who can provide the injections. PATH helped lead research in Africa and coordinated pilot introduction planning among global and country partners. Individual contributors provided funding to help jump-start pilot introduction. Key partners: FHI 360; Pfizer, Inc. Key funders: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; The Frankel Foundation; UK Department for International Development; United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA); US Agency for International Development (USAID); The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; individual contributors.Combating women's cancers With the burden of breast and cervical cancer shifting toward low-income countries, PATH is working to expand access to screening and prevention strategies. In Peru, we developed a community breast health project that screened more than 5,800 women for breast cancer and trained dozens of health providers, fueled by donations from individual contributors providing critical seed money. The project led to a planned national expansion of the model in 2013. In Uganda, the government is gearing up for a national immunization campaign against the primary cause of cervical cancer after a PATH-led project generated evidence on the best ways to introduce the vaccine\u2014a project now informing the work of governments across Africa, Asia, and Latin America to prevent cervical cancer deaths. Key partners: Government of Uganda; Peru Ministry of Health; Peru National Cancer Institute; Regional Cancer Institute in Trujillo. Key funders: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Norwegian Cancer Society/Norwegian Breast Cancer Society; Susan G. Komen for the Cure\u00ae; individual contributors.Better nutrition in every bite To combat malnutrition, we helped develop innovative distribution models to increase access to rice fortified with vitamins and minerals using PATH's Ultra Rice\u00ae fortification technology. Fortified grains are being integrated into large-scale food assistance programs in Burundi and Cambodia, commercial retail channels in Brazil, and small- scale distribution channels in Vietnam. Gifts from individual donors helped us evaluate the health impact of fortified rice in African children. In India, we helped establish high-quality manufacturing of fortified grains for a World Food Programme pilot project that will reach 98,000 children in 2013.

Key funders: Abbott Fund; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; US Department of Agriculture, Foreign Agricultural Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture; individual contributors. Speaking out for mothers and children Essential maternal health medicines can treat and prevent the leading causes of maternal deaths. PATH developed a targeted policy agenda for global and national decision-makers to increase women's access to these medicines, which cost less than US$1 per dose. Advocacy efforts led by PATH also helped safeguard access to childhood vaccines in a global treaty limiting mercury in the environment. We worked with partners to inform and influence key decision-makers, who agreed to exclude vaccines containing the preservative thiomersal from regulation. Key partners: GAVI Alliance; International International; UNFPA; UNICEF; USAID. Key funder: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Healthy families need tools and medicines to protect women during pregnancy, childbirth, and later in life. They also need childhood vaccines, good nutrition, and contraceptive options for family planning.

Advanced a vaccine candidate that cut malaria episodes by 1/3 in a trial with African infants. Paved the way to ensure stable supplies of the top malaria drug through production of a key drug ingredient. In 2012, PATH and our partners:Lifesaving drugs to protect the most vulnerable Technology innovations Our new drug development program, which grew out of our affiliation with OneWorld Health, expands our capacity to deliver integrated strategies to reduce the toll of malaria, as well as neglected tropical diseases and diarrheal disease. A new tool to fight malaria The high cost and volatile supply of the key ingredient in the most effective malaria treatment can put the drug out of reach for those most at risk. We worked with partners to develop a semisynthetic version of artemisinin to supplement fluctuating botanical supplies and began producing it in 2012. Production is set to expand to up to 60 tons by 2014, providing a more dependable supply of this lifesaving drug for malaria patients. Tackling neglected tropical diseases Visceral leishmaniasis is a neglected infectious disease endemic in 79 countries that is transmitted through the bite of sand flies, causing swelling of key organs, anemia, and death if left untreated. The antibiotic Paromomycin Intramuscular Injection (PMIM), developed by our drug development program to treat the disease, was registered by the government of Nepal. We also completed a phase 3(b) clinical trial of the therapy in Bangladesh, supporting efforts to register PMIM in that country and contributing to a national elimination strategy for the disease. We also worked to improve diagnosis and control of helminth (intestinal worm) infection, especially among children in India. Key partners: Amyris, Inc.; Gland Pharma; governments of Bangladesh Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh; Jharkhand State Department of Health; Sanofi; University of California, Berkeley. Key funders: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; UBS Optimus Foundation. Accelerating development of malaria vaccines The world's most advanced malaria vaccine candidate cuts malaria episodes by one-third among African infants (about 270 cases averted per 1,000 infants) and by one-half among toddlers (about 750 cases averted per 1,000 toddlers) over the first year of follow-up, according to results from a phase 3 trial in seven African countries. Depending on final results of the RTS,S trial, a WHO policy recommendation may occur in 2015, paving the way for African nations to decide whether to use the vaccine as part of their immunization programs. Key partners: GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines; scientists in seven African countries. Key funders: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; individual contributors.Scaling up diagnosis and treatment PATH is leading a new project to expand the diagnosis and treatment of malaria and other febrile illnesses in Africa. Through increased use of diagnostic testing, appropriate treatment, and improved laboratory services, MalariaCare aims to cut the burden of malaria by half in a population of 450 million people in Africa. Key partners: Medical Care Development International; Population Services International; Save the Children. Key funder: USAID.Stamping out malaria transmission PATH is working with national malaria control programs to target the malaria parasite village by village. Our three-step approach combines better data through rapid reporting of malaria cases, testing and treating of entire communities, and improved surveillance systems to track remaining infections. In Zambia, we helped train more than 1,100 workers in this approach in 2012. Ethiopia and Senegal are also laying the groundwork for malaria elimination, with Ethiopia creating malaria elimination learning districts and Senegal using smartphones to report malaria data while conducting community-wide test-and-treat campaigns. Evidence of their progress is driving financial and political commitments to malaria elimination even at a time of fiscal constraint. Key partners: Governments of Ethiopia, Senegal, and Zambia; Roll Back Malaria Partnership. Key funders: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; individual contributors.Despite remarkable progress in the past decade, malaria still exacts a terrible price from children, families, and communities, killing an estimated 660,000 people each year\u2014most of them young children in sub-Saharan Africa. PATH is mounting an attack on malaria from all sides: expanding the use of lifesaving tools and developing new strategies to create malaria-free communities; accelerating vaccine development; advancing diagnostic technologies; and creating a new, stable supply of the most effective drug treatment. Our ultimate goal is within reach\u2014to eliminate malaria altogether. New diagnostics for malaria elimination To support malaria elimination, PATH is identifying and analyzing the unique technical requirements and market needs for diagnostic technologies to detect remaining reservoirs of infection among people who may not show symptoms. Our work will provide countries, donors, and developers with evidence about cost-effective diagnostic tools and tactics as they focus on elimination strategies.
