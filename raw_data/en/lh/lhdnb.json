For the first time, people with Medicare's prescription drug coverage will pay no deductible and will not be responsible for any cost-sharing for ACIP-recommended vaccines, including shingles vaccine, Tdap, and travel vaccines. Similar benefits take effect on October 1, 2023, for adults insured by Medicaid (those eligible for both traditional and expansion Medicaid coverage) and a small number of young adults covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program. Between now and October 1, state Medicaid programs not already in compliance will revise their Medicaid vaccine policies to implement the new law. [CMS guidance](https://www.amcp.org/sites/default/files/2022-09/IRA-InsulinVaccines-Memo-09262022.pdf?utm_source=MagnetMail&utm_medium=email&utm_term=ajarville@ebglaw.com&utm_content=2022%2009%2028%20NewsBreak&utm_campaign=AMCP%20Sept.%2028%20NewsBREAK) notes that a Part D enrollee may still be required to pay some or all of the costs of a vaccine given to them if it is not recommended by ACIP for use in adults or is administered to a child younger than age 19 years. If ACIP recommends a new vaccine for adults during the plan year, Part D plan sponsors must require no cost-sharing for any applicable vaccine claims with dates of service after the recommendation is issued. Out-of-network claims also are required to be $0 for an ACIP-recommended adult vaccine.

CMS also interprets the term \"recommended\" to mean all categories of ACIP recommendations: routinely recommended, recommended only based on shared clinical decision-making, recommended for use only for people with specific risks (such as those with certain medical conditions), and recommended for circumstances that are not mentioned on the Adult Immunization Schedule for routine immunization (e.g., travel). [Medicare Part D plans](https://www.cms.gov/outreach-and-education/medicare-learning-network-mln/mlnproducts/downloads/vaccines-part-d-factsheet-icn908764.pdf) cover all vaccines that are commercially available, reasonable and necessary to prevent illness, and not covered by Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B vaccines (including influenza and pneumococcal vaccines) have been given to adult beneficiaries without cost-sharing for many years. This important new Medicare Part D benefit removes financial barriers to vaccination for millions of people age 65 years and older: share the news with your patients, colleagues, and friends. Encourage those with Medicare Part D to get the vaccines they need today.

This extensive set of clinical questions and answers addresses CDC COVID-19 recommendations and clinical considerations and connects readers with CDC resources. Updates incorporate policy changes made since September 8, such as booster dose recommendations for children who begin the series as early as age 6 months and the limited use of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine as a first booster dose for some adults. Immunize.org also revised its four-page job aid, [Checklist of Current Versions of U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Guidance and Clinic Support Tools](https://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3130.pdf) on January 5. The updated checklist provides new dates for the \"Ask the Experts COVID-19\" web page and CDC's MMWR index on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness and safety. Immunize.org updates this checklist at least monthly, prominently indicating when it was last updated at the top of the page. Now is a good time to verify that you are using the most current resources in your practice. In addition to updating its \"Ask the Experts: COVID-19\" content, Immunize.org has also retired educational content related to CDC's special recommendations for infection control during vaccination that were first made in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those recommendations are no longer in effect; CDC has resumed its routine recommendations for infection control and vaccine administration. Use of masks to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses in vaccination clinics should be based upon professional judgment in the specific circumstances or institutional policy. In response, Immunize.org updated its \"Ask the Experts: Administering Vaccines\" web page and retired the educational resource \"Protective Measures for Vaccinating During the Pandemic,\" as well as the web page entitled \"COVID-19 and Routine Vaccination.\" Related Links Newly updated \"65+ Flu Defense\" website offers resources for healthcare professionals serving older adults Confident recommendations for influenza vaccine from healthcare providers are powerfully persuasive. To assist you in maximizing protection for your patients, Immunize.org, in collaboration with CSL Seqirus, updated the [65+ Flu Defense](https://www.influenza-defense.org/) website. Older adults are at increased risk of severe influenza and COVID-19 illness, including hospitalization and death, especially if they are not up to date on these vaccinations.

Influenza activity on downward slope but remains high; keep encouraging vaccination Now is the best time to vaccinate anyone not yet protected from influenza this season. CDC's [Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report, FluView](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm), provides a valuable snapshot of influenza activity state-by-state. Influenza Surveillance For week 52, ending December 31, CDC's [Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report, FluView](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm), reports that nationwide, 5.4% of outpatient visits were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat (i.e., influenza-like illness [ILI]). This exceeds the national baseline of 2.5%. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating; the relative contribution of influenza virus infection to ILI varies by location. So far this season, 74 children have died from influenza-associated causes. Influenza Vaccination Dashboard CDC's [Weekly Flu Vaccination Dashboard](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-dashboard.html) shows that vaccination coverage for all children age 6 months to age 17 years is similar to coverage in December 2021, but 4.2 percentage points lower than in December 2020. Current pediatric vaccination rates among states and DC varies widely, from 24.6% to 70.4%; national coverage is 47.5%. Most children are still enduring this influenza season without the benefit of vaccination. CDC recommends everyone age 6 months and older get annual influenza vaccination. \"Vaccines.gov\" offers [VaccineFinder](http://www.vaccines.gov/), a service of Boston Children's Hospital, to help people find influenza and COVID-19 vaccines for any age group.

Related Links [Back to top](#Top) January is Cervical Health Awareness Month; promote the importance of HPV vaccination January is [Cervical Health Awareness Month](https://www.nccc-online.org/cervical-health-awareness-month/), a great time to share the importance of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. Almost all cervical cancer cases (99%) are linked to infection with high-risk HPV strains, an extremely common virus transmitted through intimate contact. CDC recommends routine HPV vaccination for all children at age 11 or 12 years and the series may be started at age 9 if preferred. Vaccination is also recommended for all people age 13 through 26 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the vaccination series. Children with normal immune systems who receive their first dose before turning age 15 require only two doses; anyone vaccinated at age 15 and older requires three. Adults age 27 through 45 years who are not already vaccinated may decide to get the HPV vaccine after speaking with their clinician. Protect your patients from cervical cancer, and many other HPV-related cancers, by recommending, promoting, and offering the HPV vaccine.
