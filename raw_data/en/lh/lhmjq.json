Do you want to be healed without all the drugs and side effects? Then consider chiropractic care as an alternative modality. Alternative medicine is fast emerging as a serious option. It provides a natural, gentle and holistic approach to healing. Three common alternative medicine modalities to consider are: Chiropractic Care - DC - Doctor of Chiropractic [Doctors of Chiropractic are highly qualified professionals](https://www.nuhs.edu/academics/college-of-professional-studies/chiropractic-medicine/), having an in-depth understanding of the human body. [Chiropractic care](https://americanchiropt.com/services/chiropractic-therpay/)is considered\"alternative medicine.\" Choosing the right one for you can be a daunting task. - Chiropractic works with the healing process by looking at the way the brain is communicating with the body through the nervous system - Chiropractors look care and approach it as a holistic system. - They do not ever just randomly crack the bones. They first assess the problem area, then relax the muscles around it, and perform careful and gentle spine realignment that may be causing muscle and nerve issues. - Chiropractor care uses spinal manipulations (adjustment) to assist joint and back pain. - Adjustments can actually help far more than just backache however. Spinal adjustments relieve more than back pain, they work on chronic headaches and migraines through relieving the pressure that vertebrae place on the nerves and muscles. - They also deal with [muscle pains through massage](https://americanchiropt.com/services/myofascial-release/)and stretching exercises. - Research has found that as far as alternative medicine is concerned, chiropractic patients have significantly less recurring symptoms than standard western medicine patients. Homeopathy - Homeopathy is based on the concept that \"like cures like\". In other words, it is possible to heal a symptom in a person by giving them minute portions of the same thing that made them sick. - Homeopathic remedies are excellent at solving chronic symptoms that western medicine has failed to cure. - Many who use this alternative medicine swear by it and never use any other remedies for their health issues. Naturopathic Medicine - ND - Naturopathic Doctor - The philosophy of naturopathy rests on the premise that the body will innately try to heal itself. By supporting this healing, long term solutions can be found to both chronic and temporary conditions. - When presented with a person who is sick, a naturopath will look for the root cause of the disease, no matter whether it is in the mind, body or spirit. - They use a range of treatment techniques ranging from nutrition and herbal medicine to the use of homeopathic remedies. Aside from these common alternative medicine practices, there are a wide range of other approaches that are slowly emerging into the mainstream. Some of these include acupuncture, Chinese medicine, kinesiology to name a few. Ultimately each person must find the system that works best for them.
