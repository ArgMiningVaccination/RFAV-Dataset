We have all experienced a moment when we seemingly become transported in time by discovering a scent from our past. There are also aromas we encounter that can immediately provide a feeling of well-being, motivation or comfort. At Nature's Oil, aroma is our passion and we have consciously curated over 500 unique scents to help you create an experience that is uniquely yours. The Science Behind Scent The nostalgic connection we experience when indulging our senses isn't just a coincidence. Our olfactory response is linked directly to the emotional center of our brain, controlling our memories, mood, behavior, and emotions. The moment we encounter that aroma from the past we immediately take a personal and unique journey down memory lane. | || | ORGANIC ESSENTIAL OILS Simply the best! At Nature's Oil we recognize that essential oils are only as good as the plant they are distilled from. With the U.S leading the world in banning toxic pesticides, we recognize the need to source certified organics. By using USDA certified organic essential oils, we make sure that the farming, distilling, brokering and filling process all follow the same exhausting standards that the USDA has instituted for the organic program regardless of the plants country of origin. This ensures every part of the supply chain including the farmers are regularly audited and held to the same unwavering standards that we hold ourself to. The process is not cheap, it's not easy, but it does make us stand out from nearly every other essential oil brand on the market. | | FRAGRANCE OILS Fragrance is more than a smell, it's a memory that's uniquely yours. For this reason we have thoughtfully crafted hundreds of premium fragrance oils that can connect you to a person, place, emotion or event from your past thru the sense of smell. The right fragrance can immediately transport you down memory lane providing the feeling of well being, motivation or comfort. Let us be a part of that journey. At Nature's Oil, we take our job very seriously! We understand and appreciate the powerful connection between the sense of smell and memories and emotions.
