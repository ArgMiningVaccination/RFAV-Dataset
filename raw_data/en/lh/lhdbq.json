But looked at on the background of traditional and new knowledge it does not seem nearly as preposterous. On the contrary, if you really look at it, it is the logical development of our modern knowledge away from the 'focus high-tech' to the 'focus human being'. Today we can be certain that this idea is correct. The goal of our analysis was to use different cut crystals on certain reflex zones of the human body and to stimulate the self-healing properties. Natural crystals did not seem fit for this purpose due to very specific reasons. Peter Mandel had the intention of imbuing artificial (amorphous) blank crystals with distinct holographic patterns and colors. The realization of this idea required a long and extremely costly effort, which was greatly supported by the Swarovski corporation in Wattens near innsbruck/ Austria. There a crystal activator and the facetted crystals were manufactured precisely according to Peter Mandel's blueprints. The treatment with the crystals consists of two different approaches: The crystal therapy positions the activator and the facetted crystals on specific areas of the skin. Crystal Puncture uses small crystals that contain a hologram and attaches them to exactly defined points on the skin. We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.
