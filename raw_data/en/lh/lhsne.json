Mr. B URTON . The Committee on Government Reform will come to order. A quorum being present, we 'll start our business. I ask unani- mous consent that all Members ' and witnesses ' written and open- ing statements be included in the record. Without objection, so or-dered. I ask unanimous consent that all articles, exhibits and ex-traneous or tabular material referred to be included in the record.Without objection, so ordered. Today we 're going to focus on the Government 's program for com- pensating families that experience vaccine injuries. We spent about2 years conducting oversight on Federal vaccine policies. We 've looked at these issues from almost every angle. We 've looked at the issues related to vaccine safety. Much more research needs to bedone in this area. We 've looked at conflicts of interest in vaccine policymaking. The Department of Health and Human Services hasa real problem in this area that we don 't believe they 're addressing. Today we 're going to look at the National Vaccine Injury Com- pensation Program. It was created by Congress to compensate fam-ilies when their children are injured by vaccines. Is it working theway Congress intended? I think the answer is no. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 to make a few preliminary points about the vaccines in general. First, vaccines are an important part of our public healthsystem. They 've saved millions of lives. They 've helped wipe out crippling diseases. We want children to be protected against infec-tious diseases. Nothing this committee does should be interpretedas anti-vaccine. Second, we want vaccines to be as safe as possible. No matter how good our vaccines are, there 's always room for improvement. The oral polio vaccine saved thousands of children from a cripplingdisease. It was a good public health tool in its time, but it was notperfect. It had a high rate of adverse events. By doing the research,a new and better vaccine was developed. Today, we 're getting the same public health benefit with far fewer side effects with the poliovaccine. Not enough research is being done in this area. Mercury is a good example. For decades, vaccine manufacturers have used mer-cury preservatives in vaccines. In the past, maybe the benefits out-weighed the risks. But today, there 's a consensus that mercury, no matter how small the quantity, does not belong in vaccines. Thetruth is, we just don 't know what the health effects of mercury are, because the research hasn 't been done. We know that some forms of mercury cause neurological disorders. There are some groups of scientists that believe that Alzheimer 's and autism are in part caused by the mercury in the vaccines. Iwant all the Members of Congress to know that the vaccine thatthey're getting for the flu has mercury in it. It 's called thimerosal. That 's a preservative, and some scientists believe it does cause, is a major contributing factor to neurological disorders. When you goover and get your shot, all you have to do is look at the packageinsert, because it does have mercury in it. I'm not saying you shouldn 't get a flu shot. But I think you should be aware that there 's a growing body of evidence that the mercury does contribute to Alzheimer 's and other diseases of that type. And it 's in the vaccine. Not enough research has been done to tell us if the mercury pre- servatives used in vaccines are related to neurological problems.But as I said, there 's a growing number of scientists that believe it is. The Institute of Medicine said that a connection is biologicallyplausible, but there 's not enough research to know. And we need to do more research to make sure. When those of us who have really looked at these issues call for more research, and when we say that we should err on the side ofcaution, I hope we won 't be accused of trying to scare the public. We shouldn 't bury our heads in the sand when it comes to vaccine safety. The best way to give the American people confidence is todo the research so we can tell the people that their vaccines areas safe as possible and most effective products are as safe as pos-sible. The third point I want to make is this. We know that no matter how safe a vaccine is, a very small number of people are going tobe injured. That 's a fact. That 's why Congress created the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, to provide compensation to familieswhen their children are injured. My colleague, Mr. Waxman, whoI'm very happy is on the committee, because he is very familiar VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May issue, he wrote the bill that created this program 15 years ago. And he deserves a lot of credit for that. At the time, vaccine manufacturers were faced with a lot of law- suits. They were threatening to leave the market. So that wouldhave adversely affected people who needed those vaccines. The sta-bility of our vaccine supply was in question. Mr. Waxman and oth-ers stepped in and created this program, and it took a lot of fore-sight. The program had three basic goals. The first goal was to pro-tect vaccine manufacturers from lawsuits. That was successful. The second goal was to stabilize the supply of vaccines in this country. Again, that was a success. The third goal was to providecompensation to families in a generous way without tying them upin court for years. And on this point, the program has not lived upto expectations. This system was designed to be generous to families whose chil- dren were suffering crippling injuries. It was meant to provide com-pensation quickly, without a lot of legal fighting. On close calls, thefamilies are supposed to get the benefit of the doubt. That 's not the way the program has been working today. It had some successes, but it 's also had some failures. If you talk to fami- lies who have been tied up in this system, it sounds like this pro-gram has become every bit as adversarial as the tort system it re-placed. Cases drag on for 6 or 8 or 10 years. The GAO said thatthe average case takes 2 years to complete. A third of the cases take more than 5 years. The Government hires teams of medical witnesses to try to disprove families ' cases. All of the Government 's expenses are paid out of the trust fund. Families are not reimbursed for their expenses for years. We 're talking about middle class families who are already paying tens ofthousands of dollars every year to take care of severely injuredchildren. We're supposed to be helping these people. But if you talk to some of these families, they feel like they 've been put through the wringer by their own Government. We have some clear evidence ofoverzealous conduct on behalf of the Government. In the case of theSword family, which we 're going to hear about today, the Special Master called the Justice Department lawyer 's tactics egregious: ''Respondent 's argument of independent corroboration from the records is especially egregious in a situation such as the instantcase in which death occurs within 4 hours of vaccination. '' In the Zuhlke family, one of the special masters recused himself from the case because he became so frustrated with the Govern-ment representative. In a case cited in our committee report lastyear, the Special Master apologized to the family for the Govern-ment 's conduct: ''In the special master 's view, respondent 's coun- sel's abrasive, tenacious, obstreperous litigation tactics were inap- propriate in a program that is intended to be less adversarial. '' We have three families here today who are going to talk about their struggles under this program. I 'd like to talk about each one of these cases in detail because they 're all so compelling. But I don't want to make our witnesses wait any longer than is nec- essary. Let me just use the Zuhlke case as an example. Janet Zuhlke 's daughter received her pre-kindergarten vaccinations in 1990. Ra- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 severe reaction almost immediately. Within 6 hours, she was vomiting and she had fever, severe headaches and pain in hereyes that made her scream. Within 3 weeks, she was in criticalcondition and she had to be medevaced to the hospital at the Uni-versity of Florida. Today Rachel is mentally retarded. She had periodic bouts of blindness. She has neurological breakdowns that confine her to awheelchair and she 'll need care for the rest of her life. A team of medical specialists diagnosed her case as a vaccine-relatedencephalopathy. That 's a condition that 's on the vaccine injury table. If you suffer a ''table injury '' you 're supposed to get com- pensation almost automatically. Well, that 's not what happened to the Zuhlkes. This case has dragged on for 9 years. The Zuhlkes still haven 't received one penny from the program. The Department of Justice and HHS spent years trying to prove that Rachel 's illness was caused by a strep infection. This case dragged on so long, they went through three special masters. As Isaid earlier, one special master recused himself from the case be-cause the Government would not settle. The Zuhlke family finallywon their case in July of this year, more than 9 years after theyfiled their petition. But they 're still probably a year away from receiving any com- pensation. For them, the second of the process is just kicking in.There 's a long period of negotiations to determine exactly how much money they 're entitled to receive. Janet Zuhlke 's already spent over $25,000 out of her own pocket to care for her daughterand to try to win this case. And that was a table injury. This was supposed to be one of the easy cases. Now, not every family has had an experience this bad. But this is not an isolated incident. You hear about these cases over andover again. It 's just wrong. Put yourself in their shoes. You have a child who suffers a terrible injury, maybe you have a child whodied like Harold Sword did. That takes a terrible emotional toll onyour family. You 're faced with hundreds of thousands of dollars in expenses, and on top of that, you have to fight the Government,with all of its resources, for years to try to get any help. Somewhere along the way, this program lost its way. The govern- ment collects an excise tax on vaccines so it can take care of fami-lies like the Zuhlkes and the Swords and the Rogers. The Govern-ment has $1.7 billion in this trust fund, and it 's growing every year. These families are supposed to get the benefit of the doubt.They 're supposed to be treated with compassion. But instead, they have to fight the Government for years to get any help at all. Now, the Justice Department and HHS deserve some credit. They 've recognized that there are some problems. They 've even backed some reforms that the Congress has not yet approved.They 've supported a longer statute of limitations, and that 's good. They 've supported legislation to authorize interim payments to families when they win the first phase. And that 's good. These are reforms Congress should enact immediately. Congressman Weldon,on our committee, Dr. Weldon, has introduced legislation that ad-dresses these problems and many others. It 's a good bill and I 'm VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May it, and I want to thank Dr. Weldon for his hard work on this issue. But the most important reform does not require legislation. It re- quires the Justice Department to take a long, hard look at the wayit does business in this area. And that goes for HHS, too. Theyhave to use some common sense. Close calls are supposed to go tothe families. The Government is not supposed to fight them toothand nail. Some of these cases don 't even look like close calls, and yet the Government fights them for years. That has to stop. Let me conclude by saying this. Vaccinations are important. We wanted children to be protected against childhood diseases. Weshould keep trying to make vaccines safer. Most kids who get vac-cinated do just fine; but there are cases where children are injured,adults as well. And those are terrible, terrible situations for thefamilies. Instead of treating them like opponents, we have to starttreating them with a little more compassion. That 's what Congress intended when we created this program, and that 's what Mr. Wax- man intended when he supported and sponsored the legislation.And that 's what we want to see happen. I want to thank Mr. Sword, Ms. Zuhlke and Mr. Rogers for being here today. We 'll be very interested in what you have to say. And I also want to thank the representatives from the Justice Depart-ment and HHS for being here. I hope they can offer us some en-couragement that they want to address these problems I just men-tioned. And with that I yield to Mr. Waxman.[The prepared statement of Hon. Dan Burton follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Gilman has to go to the White House, and I 'd like to let him go before me. Mr. B URTON . Go ahead, Mr. Gilman. Mr. G ILMAN . Thank you, Chairman Burton. I want to thank Ranking Member Waxman for yielding me this time. I welcome the panelists and I want to thank Chairman Burton for arranging this hearing, which is so important to so many of ourpeople throughout the Nation. Chairman Burton and RankingMember Waxman, you 're to be commended for your concern about these important problems. We look forward to hearing from thepanelists As our committee continues to examine the effectivenessof the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. In 1986, when Mr. Waxman farsightedly had the Congress adopt the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, it intended to providefair compensation to any individuals harmed by vaccines whilemaking certain that the vaccine manufacturers would continue tosupply and create safe vaccines to the American public. Instead,this program, jointly administered by the Department of Justiceand HHS, has regrettably become bogged down in litigation, withcases lasting years, as our good chairman has noted, facing numer-ous levels of appeal before any final decisions are made. This program initially, as Mr. Waxman introduced it, was de- signed to provide fair, expedited compensation to those who mayhave suffered any vaccine injury. During my years in the Congress,I've been contacted by a number of families in my district, all of whom have experienced varying levels of difficulty and delays withtheir claims before the compensation program, ranging from beingforced to engage in long, drawn-out court battles to outright denialof the claims due to administrative changes in definitions and incriteria. One such example, Mr. Chairman, is Tommy Sansone, Jr. The family of Tommy Sansone, Jr., a former constituent and a police of-ficer, has been trying to receive compensation for the lingering anddevastating effects of a DPT vaccine he received when he was only6 months old. His family attempted to file a claim immediatelyafter the son developed a severe, chronic seizure disorder less than2 weeks after receiving the vaccine. Regrettably, they were toldthat before a claim can be filed, the family needs to spend morethan $1,000 in non-reimbursable vaccine related expenses beforedoing so. Since Tommy was covered by his father 's insurance plan, it took several months before Sansone 's met that monetary requirement. By that time, however, the criteria for the DPT vaccine had beenchanged, eliminating seizures from the table of related side effects.For 10 years, a substantial percentage of those with brain damageand other symptoms were recognized to be DPT injuries. But by1985, the year in which Tommy 's claim was made, it was no longer recognized. These new definitions have had unintended consequences, using criteria that is so strict that the restitution fund pays fewer claimsthan ever before, despite the fact that there 's over $1.7 billion, cap- ital B, $1.7 billion, in that fund today. As a result, families of chil-dren like Tommy find it virtually impossible to win a claim in theVaccine Injury Compensation Program, another unintended con- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 was over 6 years ago, and thousands of dollars in medical expenses later. Congress envisioned that the National Vaccine Injury Compensa- tion Program would be simple, would be straightforward and morestreamlined to avoid unnecessary typical litigation. But somehowthe congressional intent has been lost along the way. Tommy faces a lifetime of crippling seizures and mounting medi- cal expenses, in addition to the emotional strain on him and hisfamily. Hopefully, this hearing will lead to necessary adjustmentsto the program and finally help children like Tommy receive thecompensation to which they are entitled. Mr. Chairman, again I thank you for conducting this hearing, and Mr. Waxman, we thank you for adopting this measure ini-tially, but hopefully we can get it back on the right track. Thankyou, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Gilman, you might take a look at Dr. Weldon 's legislation, because he has a bill that might help correct some ofthat. Mr. G ILMAN . Thank you. I look forward to looking at it. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Waxman. Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for holding this oversight hearing on the vaccine compensation program. I feela certain sense of pride as the author of that bill 15 years ago.There have been some successes with that legislation that are un-deniable, and I think we 're going to hear some questions raised today about problems in the way the vaccine compensation systemhas been implemented. Let me give some background and put this in perspective. In 1987, when Congress passed the Vaccine Injury Compensation Act,pharmaceutical companies were threatening to leave the businessof manufacturing childhood vaccines, citing among other reasons,that the increased litigation was driving them out of producingthese vaccines. The United States was facing the very real possibil-ity that we would experience a resurgence of devastating illnesseslike polio, which is a debilitating and often fatal disease that in-fected as many as 20,000 people in some years, or measles, a dis-ease that continues to kill 900,000 people worldwide even today. So in response to this potential public health crisis, Congress cre- ated the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The purpose of theprogram was threefold. First, to be a no-fault program to com-pensate people from the rare but sometimes serious side effects ofvaccines. Let me underscore that. When you immunize large num-bers of people, there are going to be some rare cases of adverse con-sequences, very serious adverse consequences. And we have to ac-knowledge that reality there. In that case, we decided that we must compensate those people. We mandate the vaccinations, for the most part, for all the childrenin this country, as a public health preventative. So if somebody 's injured, we ought to make sure that person is compensated. Wedon't take away their right to sue. But we have a compensation system that offers them an alternative to going into court. Our second objective was to lower the number of lawsuits against vaccine companies in order to encourage these companies to stayin the business. And of course, to ensure that we had a healthy do- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May vaccines. And the third purpose of the bill was to allay parents ' concerns about vaccine safety so that parents would continue to have their children vaccinated. Now, in most respects this program is working. Immunization rates are high. We rarely see outbreaks of vaccine preventable dis-ease like polio or measles. While some vaccine manufacturers haveleft the vaccine business, they cannot cite liability as a reason forleaving. And finally, people seem generally satisfied with theawards they get under the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The act Congress passed allowed people to reject their awards and sue the vaccine manufacturers once they had gone through theprogram. Very few people have gone to court. Most have receivedcompensation through the compensation system and have beenquite satisfied with it. Today, we 're going to hear from some people who went through the compensation system and did not receive an award to com-pensate them. We are to try to understand why that took place.There seems to be a greater litigiousness on the part of the Depart-ment of Justice. I 'd like to know why. The purpose of the program was not to replace the tort system with an adversarial litigiousframework, but to move to a more reasoned source for resolving theclaim and compensating those who are entitled to be compensated. Now, there is the question, about whether injuries that people have suffered are related to the vaccine? Because if you have peo-ple come forward and say, well, I had a vaccination and then I hadsome terrible result, but you can 't show that it was related to the vaccine, that 's not the purpose of the vaccine compensation system to award people money if there 's no connection between the two. So one of the issues that we have to look at is, what is the stand- ard of proof. Well, we have a table of known reactions to some ofthese vaccines, rare, but they do occur. And in that situation, weprovide automatic compensation for those who are suffering fromwhat 's called table injuries. But then you have people who have adverse effects that are not listed. And should they be compensated and what burden of proofwould they have in order to make their case to the committee thatdecides the issue. And the present law says that they have to havea preponderance of evidence to show that their injuries were relat-ed to the vaccine. Mr. Weldon has suggested, in his legislation, that we have a jus- tifiable belief standard. As I understand the standard he set inplace, would be to change the burden of proof requirement from thetraditional preponderance of the evidence standard to submittingevidence sufficient to justify a belief by a fair and impartial individ-ual that petitioner 's claims are well grounded. Now, that 's a very different and lower standard. We ought to take a look at it and examine it. I was impressed by the fact thatthe Bush administration representatives today are going to tell usthat they feel very uneasy with that standard. They feel it moves us away from science, a scientific evaluation of the connection be-tween the injury and the vaccine. They feel that it 's too low a standard and would compensate people who wouldn 't otherwise be compensated. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 have to say, I 'm a liberal Democrat. I like to see people compensated if they 're hurt. But if you open this thing too wide open, if anybody comes in and has a claim, and they can just say,I can show that a person should be convinced that there 's a rela- tionship between my injury and the vaccine, then maybe that willopen things too broadly. So I want us to look at that issue. We've heard complaints about the program. Specifically today we're going to hear from people who feel they weren 't fairly treat- ed. But we 've also heard complaints, other complaints, specifically about the statute of limitations, the fact that the program doesn 't allow for interim payments for attorneys costs, the length of timeit takes to resolve cases, and the difficulty of resolving off-table in-jury cases. So I 'm pleased we 're going to hear from people who can shed some light on these issues. Their insights as we look at theirexperiences will help us understand how this program can be im-proved. I'm also pleased that we are going to hear from the administra- tion because they 've expressed support for certain changes in the program, including increasing the statute of limitations and allow-ing for interim payments to petitioners ' attorneys for their costs. I think those are obvious important steps in easing the burden ofparents to get compensation for vaccine injuries, and I look forwardto working with this administration and my colleagues in the Con-gress in making some of these changes. But as we discuss this vaccine injury program, we have to be mindful that it 's impossible to separate the issue of the Vaccine In- jury Compensation Program from the issue of vaccine supply. Thisis why I, along with Senator Kennedy and Senator Frist, amongothers, have asked the General Accounting Office to study why vac-cine companies are leaving the business. Currently, the United States is experiencing shortages of child- hood vaccines. My office has gotten calls from doctors who cannotget tetanus vaccine, even for their high risk patients. And there arespot shortages of the DTAP vaccine, which protects kids againstdiphtheria, pertussis, or whooping cough, as well as against teta-nus. These are serious childhood diseases. We don 't want a resur- gence of them in the United States. Some providers are also experi-encing shortages of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which protectschildren against diseases caused by pneumococcal bacteria, includ-ing meningitis, which can be fatal. So I think we want to find out what 's going on in that area, why we are facing these shortages. There 's also an issue of the flu vaccine. On average, 20,000 peo- ple nationwide die from the flu yearly. Secretary Thompson is urg-ing people to get flu vaccines this year, because the symptoms fromthe flu are the same as from anthrax. However, we currently don 't have enough flu vaccine to immunize everyone. Finally, now that we 're facing actual bioterrorism, there 's an in- creasing concern specifically about our supplies of smallpox and an-thrax vaccines. There is an anthrax vaccine, there is a smallpoxvaccine. I 've read media accounts of doctors being flooded with phone calls form people saying they want to take these vaccines.At this time it would not be prudent to have universal vaccinationagainst smallpox or anthrax. However, I 'm sure it would be very VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May the public to know that if we needed them, we had adequate supplies of these vaccines. So we ought to be simplystockpiling and manufacturing at a very fast rate both vaccines. And let me point out that there 's something that sometimes comes with being around a long period of time. When I first gotelected to Congress, in 1974, in 1975 my first year here, the Fordadministration believed that we were facing a worldwide epidemicof what was known as the swine flu. And they immediately movedforward to have every American immunized against this swine flu. Well, people lined up to be immunized. What they didn 't recog- nize, and we always have to keep in mind, is that when you havemass immunization, there are going to be some adverse events. Sosome people, intending to prevent this swine flu from attackingthem, came down with some very serious side effects that we didn 't anticipate. Guillain-Barre syndrome, which caused paralysis in in-dividuals, was creeping up in numbers as a result of this mass im-munization. So I say that to point out, when people say, well, whydon't we have everyone vaccinated for anthrax or everyone vac- cinated for smallpox, that we have to be very concerned about theincrease in the adverse events, serious adverse events. And wehave to balance the risks and the benefit. It turned out, we never did get that swine flu epidemic. But we did get some of those terrible side effects. In the case of childhood vaccines, we know that without immuni- zations on a mass scale, we will get a resurgence of those diseases.That 's why we need to have mass immunizations. But if we 're going to have some of those rare terrible adverse events there aresome adverse events that are not as serious, but those serious ad-verse events ought to be the basis for compensation. And that wasthe purpose for this compensation system. I mention these specific examples of vaccine supply problems to remind us that the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program servesa very important function in helping to ensure the security of thevaccine supply. Making sure we have adequate supplies of vaccineis a public health priority, especially now with the looming fear ofbioterrorism. Our goal should be to further shore up our fragilevaccine infrastructure with safe, effective vaccines and to reassurethe public that if they do suffer from the rare but very real sideeffects of vaccines, that they will be fairly and quickly com-pensated. I want to thank all the witnesses for being here today. Unfortu- nately, what happens often in our congressional day is that wehave many things scheduled at the same time. When I was chair-man of the Health and Environment Subcommittee, I could sched-ule the hearings to fit my schedule, and I could plan to be therethroughout the hearing. Now I 'm experiencing what the majority used to experience when they were in the minority, our day is notup to us to schedule, it 's up to those other committee chairmen and those on the floor to set where we have to be. Today I find myselfhaving to be at a number of places at the same time. I want to assure all the witnesses that if I 'm not here personally, I will review their testimony. My staff is here to hear them and wewill work with our colleagues in trying to figure out how to makethose necessary changes in the vaccine compensation program to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May goals we had 15 years ago, and the goals we still have today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me this time to make this lengthy statement. [The prepared statement of Hon. Henry A. Waxman follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 Well, as the author of the legislation, I think you probably know as much or more about this than anybody, and weappreciate what you 've done and hopefully what you can help us do in the future. Mr. Horn.Mr. H ORN. Mr. Chairman, I commend you for getting these cases, and I would suggest that we move on and get to questioning andnot opening statements. Mr. B URTON . Do you yield your time, then? Mr. H ORN. Yes. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Kucinich. Mr. K UCINICH . I want to say briefly, first of all, I too have a si- multaneous committee hearing going on, and I 'm one of the Demo- crats who is needed over there. I 'm going to try to come back to this hearing. But I want to say that for those who are here to testify, I think that it 's important for the country to hear what you have to say. The efforts that have been made by Mr. Waxman, to assure thatif injuries do occur there will be compensation, is something thatI think this Congress needs to be mindful of with respect to themoral obligation of Government to compensate people if they areinjured through participating in a Government mandated program,or a program that Government is advocating wide subscription bythe public. Certainly in this era, vaccinations take on an even greater con- cern with the mass public. I think that for those of you who havehad families and loved ones, particularly who have suffered an in-jury, it pains me as a Member of Congress to even have thethought that our Government could be engaging in litigation tocontest legitimate claims. And it 's something that ought to concern everyone here. So I appreciate your presence here. I know that along with Mr. Waxman, I 'm going to be following very carefully the results of the testimony today. I look forward to the proceedings. And I thank theChair for calling the hearing. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Kucinich. Dr. Weldon.Dr. W ELDON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to just say that normally I wholeheartedly endorse the sentiments of Mr. Horn at hearings. I think it 's important that we get to the testimony as quickly as possible. However, I want to just make two important comments. No. 1, I want to welcome Janet Zuhlke, we 're going to hear testimony from her. She 's a courageous lady. The chairman has outlined some of the details of her ordeal. I 'm sure she 'll be going into that in more detail in her testimony. And I hope one of the things that wecan get at in this hearing is why does it take so long for some ofthese cases to work through the system. The other point I want to make is I was practicing medicine when the original bill was passed. I want to commend the rankingmember, Mr. Waxman. It was, I think, a badly needed piece of leg-islation. And at the time, from my perspective, it was a well craftedpiece of legislation. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 one of the fundamental problems with the system is that, and no offense to my attorney friends on the committee, it 's just that we 've allowed attorneys the opportunity to manage a lot of this. I think changing the burden of proof provisions in law is need-ed. I 'm certainly open to discussions of modifying my language. I 'm quite pleased that the administration has endorsed many of theprovisions in the bill. And I just want to point out that my bill is definitely very bipar- tisan. It is supported by a very broad spectrum of Members of theHouse of Representatives. Any piece of legislation that could haveChairman Burton, myself, Jerry Nadler and Barney Frank on thesame piece of legislation has to be correctly labeled as a bipartisanpiece of legislation. And frankly, I think if we all sit down and try to work through some of the details on this issue, in good faith, we should be ableto get this bill marked up in Commerce and possibly pass it out ofthe House of Representatives on suspension. There 's pretty broad based agreement, I think, that some changes need to be made. So I'm looking forward to the testimony of all our witnesses, and certainly my constituent from Satellite Beach, Janet Zuhlke. AndI yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Weldon. Ms. Watson, did you have a comment?Ms. W ATSON . No, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Cummings. Mr. C UMMINGS . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. This committee has held several hearings on the issue of vaccina- tions, adverse reactions to vaccinations, the Vaccine Injury Com-pensation Program, vaccinations for our military personnel andFDA regulations of vaccines. The purpose of today 's hearing is to review the Department of Justice 's and the Department of Health and Human Resources ' implementation of the Vaccine Injury Com- pensation Program. I fully believe in vaccinations. Vaccines are responsible for the eradication of some diseases that are common in this country. Fur-ther, in light of recent events, there has been increased talk of vac-cinating lab technicians, public health workers, law enforcement of-ficers, clean-up crews and even postal workers as the threat of an-thrax exposure widens. Congress adopted the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which established the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Theprogram was established for three main reasons. One, to fairly andquickly compensate children who were injured by vaccines; two, todecrease litigation filed against vaccine manufacturers in order toencourage them to stay in the vaccine market, thus ensuring a suf-ficient vaccine supply; and three, to reassure parents so that theywould continue to immunize their children. Mr. Chairman, I believe the program is working as Mr. Waxman, the author of the original legislation in Congress intended when itpassed it in 1986. Of course, there are some people not fully satis-fied with the program. Perhaps the statute of limitations is tooshort and perhaps it does take too long to compensate claimants. However, the program has been successful in its policy goals of ensuring vaccine supply and establishing a program for individuals VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May childhood vaccines. Congress was respon- sive to growing concerns of fears about vaccine safety and the vac-cine preventable diseases by creating a no-fault compensation pro-gram for people who were injured by vaccines that are part of theroutine childhood immunization schedule. Finally, Congress needs to continue its role to guarantee the safety of vaccines and to ensure that the goals of the program aremet in the future. Besides holding hearings on this very importantissue, the committee and Congress can update their Web sites andother forms of communication for easy access to information. Novaccine is perfectly safe, but vaccines are responsible for preventingthe spreading of infectious diseases and in some cases, eliminatingthem altogether. Disease prevention is the key to public health. Parents need to be fully informed of the possible adverse effects and alternate im-munization schedules. This can be accomplished by their healthcare personnel or through useful Web sites and timely communica-tion. I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses today. I know that they are all moving in the right direction and I thank themfor being here. With that, I yield back.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Cummings. Mrs. Davis.Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just to show that we work in a bipartisan manner, I have three committee meetings going on at 11 o 'clock. So I will have to excuse myself, and I have to apologize that I won 't get to hear the panel. But I will come back to the hearing as soon as I can. Mr. B URTON . We 'll give you information on the hearing as well. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Duncan. Mr. D UNCAN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Very briefly, I want to first of all thank you for calling this very important hearing. I have some great concern about these vaccina-tions. I remember Shay Beaker, a woman coming to see me at aconstituent day in Lenore City, TN, and telling me about her sonwho was perfectly healthy until he was close to 1 year in age, andshe took him for a DPT vaccination. At the time she came to seeme, he was 2 years old, weighed 22 pounds, had continuous convul-sions and seizures, projectile vomiting and all sorts of horriblethings on a daily basis. The Dyer family from Knoxville, TN, came to me and told me about their son, Andy Dyer, who 's now 10 years old. When he was 2, he received a DPT vaccination and his family has been unableto get compensation, although there were 600 incidents from hisbatch 78 claims from his lot, 44 of them in Tennessee, including3 deaths. This is a young boy who can 't walk, can 't talk, requires full time care, on a 24 hour basis. His family was told that his 48hour symptoms were not severe enough, although he stopped suck-ling, he started continually flicking his ear and having small sei-zures right after this vaccination. So I have great concern, and I 'm looking forward to hearing from these witnesses. I think this is a program that is crying out for re- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May based on what I 've heard from my constituents and from other people from around the country. So I look forward to the tes-timony of the witnesses, and I thank you for allowing me to be partof this hearing. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Duncan. Ms. Norton, do you have an opening comment?Ms. N ORTON . Mr. Chairman, only to say that I think this is an important and timely hearing that you 're holding. At a time when terrorism must cause us to encourage people to participate, espe-cially as to children, and programs that provide needed vaccines,compensation in case of a mishap is very important. But I hope that given the fact that we are probably going to see more and more children and more and more adults facing the ne-cessity to take vaccines, I hope that this war we are in will spurus into more research, so that whatever fear there is of those vac-cines that have caused problems to a few will not become a moregeneralized fear at a time when frankly, we can 't afford that kind of fear. But part of the reason for that fear is that these vaccines are not always as perfected as they might be. I think our country has donean extraordinary job, given the small number of injuries anddeaths which in fact come out of vaccinations. Medical science isnot perfect, and science is not perfect. But we have certainly gonevery far in using vaccines to protect our own public. Now as we hear that it may become necessary once again to vac- cinate people against smallpox, and we know that there are, for avery small number of people, some serious side effects, we need towork harder than ever on making sure that those side effects areconquered and disappear, particularly when it comes to somethinglike smallpox. We can 't afford to have people saying against the smallpox, sorry, I don 't want that vaccine. Because as we learned, one person unvaccinated can do great harm. But the only way to instill confidence is not only to say to people, don't worry, if something happens, if your child dies, if your child is incapacitated, then there 's compensation for you. That 's the least we can do. We ought to use what we 're going through now to do the kinds of stepped up research that will take away the fear, be-cause we have reduced almost entirely the side effects and cer-tainly the serious side effects or death from vaccine injury. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for this important and timely hearing. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Ms. Norton. Mr. Schrock.Mr. S CHROCK . Mr. Chairman, I concur with Mr. Horn 's opinion about opening statements, because we have to vote. I 'm ready to hear the panel members. I 'll have no opening statement. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Schrock. Mr. Clay, do you have any comments?Mr. C LAY. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. It 's a privilege to meet with the committee today. I especially welcome the parents and spouses who are witnesses today. It is noted that all of the parents and spouses on the panelhave family members who have suffered adverse effects as a result VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May Additionally, I welcome all other witnesses of the panels. Mr. Chairman, my No. 1 focus, while I am in office, is children. I'm a father, as you are, and I 'm especially grateful that you extend that parental concern through this committee. This hearing exam-ines the injury compensation program and has the purpose of fairlyand quickly compensating children who are injured by vaccines todecrease litigation against manufacturers, so as to encourage themto stay in the vaccine market. Overall, the vaccine injury program has worked well. There are still some areas of concern within the program that must be ad-justed. We know that the program is not perfect. The intent of thishearing today is to address those areas that need adjustment. Andat this point, Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to enter thisstatement into the record. Mr. B URTON . Without objection, so ordered. Thank you, Mr. Clay. [The prepared statement of Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay follows:] VerDate I apologize to the panels, we will get to you just as quickly as this vote is concluded. We have a vote on the floor, sowe will recess the committee and be back here in about 10 or 15minutes and we 'll go to the first panel immediately upon our arriv- al. Thank you. We stand in recess.[Recess.]Mr. B URTON . The committee will come to order. I'd like to now have the first witness panel, Mrs. Janet Zuhlke, Mr. Harold Sword and Thad Rogers, please come to the witnesstable. It's customary that we swear in our witnesses, so would you raise your right hands, please? [Witnesses sworn.]Mr. B URTON . Be seated. I think Dr. Weldon wants to introduce you, Ms. Zuhlke, so we 'll let you speak after he returns. He 's on his way back. So we 'll start with Mr. Rogers. Do you have an opening statement, Mr. Rogers?If you could, we want to ask questions, so if you could keep yourstatements as close to 5 minutes as possible, we 'd appreciate it. But go ahead, take your time. Mr. Rogers. STATEMENTS OF THAD ROGERS, AUBURN, AL; HAROLD SWORD, COLUMBUS, OH; AND JANET ZUHLKE, SATELLITEBEACH, FL Mr. R OGERS . I'm glad we finally got to be here, because you all kept postponing everything on us, and we finally got to make it. My name is Thad Rogers, and my wife was \u2014her life was de- stroyed by a tetanus shot \u2014tetanus vaccine. Before the vaccine, my wife bowled, coached basketball and softball, and played tenniswith our daughter. She was just a normal, healthy human being. She did the motherly thing, drove our son and daughter to activi- ties they were involved in, basketball, softball, soccer, tennis, BoyScouts and Girl Scouts. She did all the household activities like awife would do. We also fished as a family, we did everything to-gether as a family. My wife had a vaccine on February 15, 1991. During the summer of 1991, she became unable to drive or do any kind of householdwork. I had to start taking the kids to the activities and learn howto do housework and cook and do everything else most husbandsdon't know how to do. At this time, my wife 's health was getting worse. Her body was just deteriorating. We took our last family vacation in the summer of 1996. Ever since then, she has not been able to get out of bed by herself orbasically leave the house. She 's in diapers. And right now, she 's on a catheter, because she 's on a special air bed. Someone has to be with her around the clock to feed her, give her medicine, change the diaper, empty the catheter bag. Since 1997, she 's had bed baths, hasn 't been able to take a full bath basically since she 's been sick. And my kids, they help take care of my wife when I 'm at work. Our daughter is in her 4th year of college and our son is in his 2nd year. Soon they 'll be starting their own lives, and like I said, they help me take care of her. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May 2001, my wife got a bed sore. She 's been in a special air bed since then, has not been out of it since January. The bedsore requires dressing twice a day to twice a week, whenever it 's necessary. Generally, life with her has been extremely hard. Iguess you 'd say she 's real hard to get along with because of the ill- ness. She snaps at everybody, this, that and the other. It 's just been hard, it really has. That 's all. [The prepared statement of Mr. Rogers follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Did you want to make any comment, Mr. Rogers, about the compensation fund at all? Did you receive anything fromthe compensation fund, for the damage that was done by the vac-cine? Did you receive any money from them? Mr. R OGERS . We have not received anything. Mr. B URTON . Have you applied for that? Mr. R OGERS . We filed in 1994. Mr. B URTON . What happened? Can you just tell us a little bit about that? Mr. R OGERS . Well, you go through the process, and we had a phone conference with a special master and different lawyers. Butin June 2000, we got word that the court concluded that my wifewas entitled for help. But of course, they needed to know, I guessyou'd say like dollars and cents, what was required to take care of her. Because I 've been taking care of her out of my pocket the whole time, except for the insurance part. And in September 2001, the case was appealed. And we haven 't heard anything since then. Mr. B URTON . OK, we 'll ask you some questions about that in just a few minutes. Mr. Sword.Mr. S WORD . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Harold Sword. I am a lifetime resident of Ohio, a product of Ohio schools and colleges, a veteran of the U.S. Navy,father of six and grandparent of nine. Following the Navy I serveda 6-year union apprenticeship, attended school while raising myfamily and I have worked for 40 years in the newspaper printingindustry. Before I begin, I would like to thank the committee for its work and attention to vaccine injury. I would also like to say that I haveno bias against vaccine as a medical treatment as long as it is safe.When vaccine produces something other than safe, I think we areall diminished. I'm here to discuss vaccine injury because my daughter, Natalie Nicole Sword, died of vaccine injury on her birthday at 3 monthsof age on May 13, 1975, just 4 hours after a childhood DPT vac-cination as part of a normal 3 month exam by her doctor. At thetime of Natalie 's death, there were no requirements to warn par- ents of adverse vaccine reactions, despite 30 years of documentedmedical knowledge and research going back into the 1940 's of the dangers. We were told, ''she will be sleepy and that is normal. '' Consequently, after leaving the doctors ' office, on the trip home that included a quick stop for ice cream and to pick up a grapevine, we drove near or past seven hospitals and nearly a dozenother emergency medical sites on the route home. Natalie neverawoke from the deepening slumber that started around noon whilestill in the doctor 's office. Unconcerned with the slumber, we al- lowed her to sleep next to us in a bassinet before discovering Nat-alie not breathing and blue. During our frantic efforts to revive Natalie, I spoke twice to her doctor by phone, commenting to him, ''there was something in that shot that caused a reaction. '' Just 4 hours after his examination of Natalie, her doctor 's immediate response to me was denial, saying, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May be the vaccine, call me as soon as you get to the hospital. '' The hospital offered no opinion on cause after talking to the doc- tor upon our arrival in the unequipped county sheriff 's emergency vehicle through miles of major highway construction. That denialcontinued in a meeting to review the cause of death with Natalie 's doctor 2 weeks later, following the autopsy. Sadly, and outrageously, 30 years after a published article on the vaccine deaths of twin boys in the 1940 's, Natalie had died a simi- lar death without warning. Who is at risk, how to know, and isthere ever a ''morally acceptable '' risk of death or injury to any child, even as a well intended protection, but especially withoutever knowing of the risk? Yet, completely ignoring the vaccine, we were told by the doctor that performed the autopsy, the coroner, physician and publichealth officials that the cause of Natalie 's death was something that we had never heard of called SIDS, sudden infant death syn-drome. Webster 's dictionary describes SIDS as being an unknown cause. However rare, effected families have both a right and a real need to know the truth about vaccine problems. Morality and law shouldrequire accurate reporting of cause in public records when vaccinescould be a factor in any injury or death, and information should beprovided on the vaccine injury program. More accurate reportingalone could help reduce costs and controversy in the vaccine injuryclaims. In Natalie 's case, it was 15 years before we even started to learn the truth, and then it was a result of chance, when a co-workerwho was deaf noticed a wire story of a deadline for filing vaccineinjury claims as we worked on the next newspaper edition. Priorto that article, I knew nothing about a vaccine injury program. Ihad lived with my suspicions, attending SIDS support groupsalone, because Natalie 's mother had a whole different approach to her grief. I found SIDS logic did not work for me. Although I had strong doubts about the ''SIDS cause of death '' ruling, I had not sought legal counsel. Filing suit seemed to be an impossible option becauseof the SIDS ruling. I did not want to complicate our grief, did notwant to hurt the doctor, feeling that nothing we could do wouldbring Natalie back. I now suspect many people have reacted that way, contrary to Government agency adversarial attitudes toward those who man-aged to discover the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and fileclaims. Once we found the program late in July, I collected the in-formation and suit was filed near the end of the deadline. However, the suits were separated into two classes by time, and there were many suits filed in the pre-1988, creating a huge back-log of cases. From the outset, that volume was a problem for every-one. How that was handled was to wait for the system to get to your case. By the end, for our claim and others, it became an un-even legal field, because attorney fees and expenses for expert wit-nesses and awards all remained under a cap of mid-1980 dollars,and inflation eroded all three. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 attorney fees and expert witnesses allow- ance created limits on resources for claimants that were in the sys-tem for the longest time and also altered the equality of the awardfor those who had to endure to the end. Meanwhile, as far as Iknew, there were no similar limits on Government 's ability to con- test claims. Could that happen again if mass vaccines had to occurfor any reason? While time and adversity were problems for the claimants due to the specific limits, time and adversity became a windfall for whatbecame the other side. For my family, there developed a clear senseof a ''betrayal of trust '' by our Government 's agents as time passed. Advocates and other claimants I came in contact with believed Gov-ernment was supposed to conduct the Vaccine Compensation Pro-gram as adversarial, timely and generous. That was not the wayit was handled by my experience, nor was it the experience of somethat I heard of. In Natalie 's case, years went by, hearings came and went, and adversity grew as Government experts came with several otherpossible alternate causes of death that did not agree, not even withone another. It seemed like any answer except vaccine was a pos-sible cause of death and a reason to litigate further, because theycould. Neither the circumstances nor the valid evidence nor the ex-perts opinion that were paid for by the program were of any valuein resolving that adversity and served at best only to keep theclaim alive within that system. As more time passed, the more hearings, the more experts, the more adversity, the more inflation eroded both the resources to con-tinue the claims and the original value of the awards, Governmentagents had the budget resources and could just run out the clock.In our case, we struggled to come up with the money rather thanto lose the claim. At one point late in the process, we had to unex-pectedly change expert witnesses due to problems unrelated to theclaim. We had to sacrifice quickly and come up with retainermoney for that replacement expert witness. We lost over $1,000 onthe first retainer, money we were never able to recover. By that time we were single parents with split custody, and struggling with post-divorce finances. For both of us, it was a lotof money to fly and lodge separately in order to attend and testifyin Boston, and later to attend the appeals court hearing here inWashington. Once the appeals court ruled, and mercifully therewas not a further appeal, the judgment was paid within a reason-able time. By the end, I am sure Natalie 's claim went well over the vaccine injury program 's limit on both attorney costs and expert witness costs. I paid $10,000 from my portion of the judgment award forexperts we used. I 'm sure I paid only a portion of those expenses and none of the attorney firm 's real costs. Yet when I asked, our attorney, Ron Homer, declined saying, ''you've been through enough, that money should belong to you and your family. '' I feel all things combined created something other than what was intended in good faith by Congress. I doubt those disadvan-tages or disparities for claimants were due to any valid intent onthe part of Congress; but they may suggest ongoing oversight. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 does occur, I can tell you from expe- rience the last thing a family needs is a misguided lack of informa-tion or a complicated ordeal, compounded by adversity. What fami-lies do need is a reliable safety net. For my family, however, theoutcome will not be happily ever after. I will always wonder thetrue effect Natalie 's death had statistically or otherwise on our family. Not long after the vaccine injury claim was filed, Natalie 's moth- er became despondent and expressed feelings of hopelessness. Un-expectedly, we separated. During the counseling that followed, shewas diagnosed with depression. But in denial, she declined treat-ment. A domestic meltdown followed, with problems especially forthe children. I 'm old enough to know that there have been many factors in those matters. But in families, there can be complicatedsocial side effects surrounding vaccine injury that have little to dowith the original event, affecting entire families for a long time. We are urged by the origins of faith and morality to ''love our neighbor. '' In fact, we are told in Scripture that ''love is the law 's fulfillment. '' I urge each of you to consider carefully and tenderly the lives of those who are touched by vaccine injury and this vac-cine injury program. Again, I appreciate the opportunity to share this information with you. In my daughter 's memory, I pray it contributes some- thing useful and helps all of us somehow. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Sword follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 you, Mr. Sword. Dr. Weldon, do you want to introduce Ms. Zuhlke?Dr. W ELDON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to again welcome Janet Zuhlke for coming here. We 're all looking forward to your testimony. I think it 's very important, and I commend you for your willingness to come and provide the infor-mation about your experience with the vaccine injury program. Mr. B URTON . Ms. Zuhlke. Ms. Z UHLKE . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Congress- man Weldon. I appreciate the opportunity to be here. My name is Janet Zuhlke. I was invited here today concerning my daughter, RachelAnne. Rachel was adversely affected by her immunization at theage of 5. Rachel will be 17 this December. She suffers from sei-zures, mental retardation. I must bathe my daughter, take care ofall of her personal needs, dress her, help her with feeding. Rachel was declared eligible for compensation in June of this year. We are now in the life care planning evaluation process. Thecircumstances surrounding her injury are basically the same. Itwas Thursday, March 1, 1990. Rachel again was 5 years old. I hadtaken her to see her pediatrician, Dr. Richard O 'Hern, as a well child, so that she could receive her DPT and OPV immunizations. Within 6 hours of her immunizations, she was displaying alarm- ing symptoms that were unknown to me, specifically, vomiting andcomplaining of severe eye pain. Fever and soreness at theinjectionsite were also present, but those were not unusual to meas a parent. Rachel is my middle child, I have an older daughterand a younger one as well. This was just different. On Friday, March 2nd, I phoned the doctor 's office, expressing concern about the vomiting and the eye pain. I was told it was un-related to the vaccines and to give the office a call on Monday ifher symptoms had not subsided. Over the weekend, Rachel 's vomiting had stopped, but she was still complaining of severe eye pain, and she had become lethargic,very abnormal for Rachel Anne. I was concerned with Rachel 's lack of energy and the issue of the persistent eye pain, so much so thatwhen the doctor 's office opened on Monday, I was waiting at their door with my daughter. Rachel was seen by a nurse practitioner who diagnosed strep throat. There were no signs being exhibited of sore throat, runnynose, enlarged lymph nodes. She still had a low grade temperature.Again, a misdiagnosis. Over the next 20 days, Rachel became much more lethargic and complained continuously of eye pain. The severity of her conditionbecame so apparent to me that I phoned Dr. O 'Hern on that Sun- day night, and he agreed to meet us in the emergency room at ourlocal facility. Upon completing his examination of Rachel, he toldme that something was affecting her central nervous system, thatshe would need to be admitted and tests would need to be per-formed. During that time, a barrage of questions came to me concerning could the child have ingested any household chemicals, pharma-ceuticals, etc. It became more apparent in discussion with her pedi-atrician that the symptoms were the same as she presented on the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May acuteness. Rachel was air evacu- ated to Shand 's Hospital at the University of Florida in critical con- dition. The way I learned about the NVIC program was through Dr. O'Hern. He apparently had checked with the drug manufacturers concerning the lot numbers on the serums that my daughter wasgiven. He was told that there were no other reported cases. It wasat that time that he informed me of the NVIC. Rachel 's diagnosis then and to date has continued to maintain itself as post vaccineencephalitis. Filing the claim, I found an individual named Mr. Clifford Shoe- maker out of Vienna, VA. I read an article in a newspaper by afamily that had been affected as well. The mother was graciousenough to speak with me and give me this gentleman 's name. Mr. Shoemaker has been representing Rachel since 1991, when herclaim was filed. Although Rachel is eligible, she has not received any compensa- tion for her injuries. All expenses have been out of pocket, from myfamily. And as you stated in your opening, sir, I am now goingthrough receipts and trying to obtain this information so that I canbe compensated for my out of pocket. In the first 5 years alone, andagain, I 'm almost going into my 11th year now, I have documented bills showing over $25,000. Again, I was asked about observations regarding the effective- ness of this program. I also have great respect for immunizing yourchildren. I still to this day think that is a very valuable thing thatwe must do. I have never fought through a drug manufacturer, norhave I had any sort of confrontation with Dr. O 'Hern. I think he was doing his job. I think Rachel was given a drug that she shouldhave been given, I just feel very badly that it turned out as trag-ically as it did. In addition to the regular medical exams, Rachel has had at least 30 medical emergencies which include numerous air evacuationsand critical care. Every visit and incident that my daughter hasundergone, I have had to provide to the Department of Justice in-formation concerning those admissions. And as you can imagine,over time, she would have an episode, if you will, of one neuro-logical dysfunction or another and we would get past that, I wouldsubmit that information and my child would neurologically failagain, and I then had to go back through and again provide infor-mation concerning that particular episode. It has been a never end-ing story. She still has problems. She still requires hospitalizations, and I still to this day am required to submit all medical records and in-formation to the Department of Justice. It 's time consuming and it is not cost effective. I have had issues where I have been in con-versation with, I 'll give an example of delays. Over the years there have been many, many deadlines given. I 've been in status con- ferences with the special masters. Again, my daughter has hadfour. During one of these specific conferences, the Department of Jus- tice was not prepared and they requested an extension of time.These extensions are not for days or even weeks. These extensionswere for months at a time. I found that unacceptable. We could go VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May easily without anything being done. And yet we 'd come back to the status conference and again, the individual was allowedto have another deadline. I got so exasperated at one point, and again, I 'm speaking to the special master, I didn 't show much grace. I was very upset, I voiced my opinion, when is a deadline a deadline. I was not given an an-swer on that question. The ongoing impression I had and still have is that the Depart- ment of Justice made little effort to prepare for these deadlines.Since they were never challenged or commanded to do so, theyknew the delay would be granted. There was never any sense ofurgency and even after rescheduling, the DOJ often was still notprepared. Again, I find that unacceptable. I would like to say, of the four special masters, Rachel had one, the first was for 5 or 6 years. The next was for 2 to 3. She 's had two in the last 2 years. May I mention names, sir? It 's Chief Spe- cial Master Golkowitz, actually, that was extremely helpful to myfamily. For the first time in many, many years, I felt like possiblyseeing a light at the end of the tunnel. He was the gentleman youreferred to before that had to recuse himself. He actually came tome after the very first hearing, which was supposed to be a medi-ation hearing, where the parties had come together on the assump-tion that we are going to agree. We went through the whole day, got finished, and the DOJ said, sorry, we offer you no settlement. He was incensed, to say theleast. He found me in the lobby, you know what his words were,you repeated them before. He was ashamed. He was absolutelyashamed of how everything had transpired, and told me that hewas sorry, but he was no longer impartial to be able to help me.He was no longer impartial. So we were passed on to a fourth special master who this gen- tleman is Master Hastings. Master Hastings has finally helped myfamily to a conclusion. And I 'm very grateful. The adversarial aspects of this I think are just sad. I think Ra- chel has been treated basically like a criminal, like she 's done something wrong, which is not the case. In spite of the early diag-nosis that Rachel had experienced, severe central nervous systemdamage, specifically post vaccine encephalitis, the DOJ attorney re-peatedly attempted to suggest alternative theories of the cause ofher injuries. At one point, one of the experts for the DOJ actuallystated that it must have been a virus that was in the community. In June 1999, Rachel 's pediatrician, a doctor who has been with her since birth, gave a deposition. That same day, her pediatricneurologist also gave his deposition. Both physicians gave un-equivocal testimony that it was their medical opinion that Rachel 's injuries were directly caused by her vaccine. Yet in spite of thattestimony, the DOJ attorney recommended to the third specialmaster that the Government offer nothing. The adversarial process continues to this day. We are now in the life planning process. A life planner has come in for Rachel Anne.She has commenced the evaluation and the estimation of Rachel 's lifetime care costs. The DOJ has appointed another life planner,who I have still not heard one word from. The young lady has comeforward on Rachel 's behalf to help. She 's prepared, she 's ready. I VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May heard a word from the DOJ. I don 't have an appoint- ment time set up. I have nothing. And this is November 1st, andthis process has been ongoing since July. Not even a phone call.Again, I find that unacceptable. The best evidence of the adversarial process, I think, is in the last line of the decision of the special master. He stated that Ra-chel's eligibility is ''a table injury encephalopathy. '' That is essen- tially the same diagnosis that was made 11 years ago by her pedia-trician and ongoing immunologists and neurologists at Shand 's Hospital. In my opinion, the DOJ 's mission is to investigate crime, pros- ecute criminals and enforce the law. Litigation is their primarytool. The NVICP is based on a medical determination. I don 't think the DOJ is the correct agency to make medical determinations. Based on my experience, I do not believe the program is working as Congress intended. I 've read the proposed changes to the cur- rent law, and I very much support those proposed changes. In addi-tion, I have three recommendations. I think a total time line forthe entire eligibility determination process to be resolved, a fixeddeadline, is needed. I think we need to redefine the goals for theprocess, ensure those goals include a sense of urgency and a totalfocus on making a compassionate medical decision. And again, as Harold was explaining, you 've got to understand, it does not just affect the child. It affects the entire mechanics ofyour whole family. My 15 year marriage also fell apart from a unitthat I thought was very strong. My other two children have suf-fered as well, not being able to do the things, possibly because ofwhat their sister 's needs were. And I, sir, have not taken a family vacation with my children in 11 years, because there 's not the money to do that. Because I have spent every dime on Rachel 's medical needs. And again, to this day, have not received one pennyin reimbursement. My third recommendation, and I 'll be finished, I think you should create a regular independent oversight to ensure that the processis achieving the intent of providing a fair, expeditious and generousoutcome to the families. Again, I appreciate the opportunity to be here and for the efforts that you are making for families like mine and for the other peoplethat have graciously appeared today. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Zuhlke follows:] VerDate Thank you. I want to thank all three of you. I know it's very difficult for you to be here and for you to testify about your family 's problems. I can assure you that we will be overseeing the Justice Department on a regular basis as long as I 'm the chairman. I don 't know about my colleagues, but I will be talking to people at the Justice Department, including, when Mr. Ashcroft gets sometime, with the tragedy that 's going on here, facing the country, to discuss this as well. Let me start with you, Ms. Zuhlke. In his written testimony, which we have before us, and we 'll hear from Mr. Harris in a little bit, Mr. Harris says that most of the people who complain aboutthe program are people who lost their cases. He says, ''I believe it is the denial of scientifically unsupported petitions that may giverise to complaints about the program. '' Did you win your case?Ms. Z UHLKE . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . How long did it take? Ms. Z UHLKE . 10 years. Mr. B URTON . You mentioned the complaints about the program, so I'll skip that. Have you talked to other families with similar complaints? Ms. Z UHLKE . No, sir. I personally do not know other families with children who have been affected. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Sword, did you win or lose your case? Mr. S WORD . We finally won our case on appeal. Mr. B URTON . So they fought you all the way through to the ap- peals process? Mr. S WORD . Yes. Mr. B URTON . How long did that take? Mr. S WORD . We filed the claim when I discovered the information in the fall of 1990. And the final hearing for the appeals was inthe spring of 1999, and we were paid in August 1999. Mr. B URTON . So it took over 9 years? Mr. S WORD . Yes. Mr. B URTON . What kind of complaints do you have about the pro- gram? Mr. S WORD . I don 't think it 's compassionate enough. I think truthfully that the States need to be comfortable with mandatingthese vaccines. And I think that the public needs to be assuredthat the vaccines are both safe and if there is a rare reaction, thatthere is a mechanism there as a safety net for them to turn to. One other thing I would say is, I don 't think there 's enough infor- mation provided to families about either the dangers of vaccines,or I don 't think there 's enough provided about the options available to them when some kind of a question about a vaccine incidentdoes occur. And I also think there 's a problem with public records and the reporting that goes on in those areas. Mr. B URTON . Have you talked to any other families that have similar complaints? Mr. S WORD . I went to a vaccine conference here in Washington sponsored by the National Vaccine Information Center in, I thinkit was September 1997. I met many families at that conference.Since then, I 've talked also with people in the State of Ohio, there is an advocacy organization in the State of Ohio, and I was asked VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May the Ohio Legislature when they were considering man- dating Hepatitis B. I told our story basically. And I met people that ranged from people with children to people that were adults. I heard a story about a volunteer fireman whowas similarly affected and couldn 't get a medical diagnosis. Many of these people are left in limbo. As I said in my testimony, I thinkmany people either don 't know or simply don 't approach the pro- gram for a variety of different reasons. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Rogers, I know the Government is now appeal- ing your case. But when the special master made his decision lastyear, did you win or lose? Mr. R OGERS . Won. Mr. B URTON . You won? OGERS . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . But the Government, the Justice Department, is appealing your case? Mr. R OGERS . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . How long did it take before you won initially? Mr. R OGERS . Like I said, we started February 15, 1994. Mr. B URTON . So it took almost 6 years? Mr. R OGERS . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . What kind of complaints would you have about the program? Mr. R OGERS . Well, when we had heard about the program, I live next door to Auburn University. I went to their library, I call it thelittle green book, the one that Mr. Waxman had sort of designed.We read it from cover to cover. It sounded pretty interesting, espe-cially the part like when you file it, and then a year after that, ev-erything is taken care of. Well, this is not true, sir. It is not true at all. Even though my wife went through the table of the injury process with the tetanusshot, she fell in that table of what would happen if the vaccine wasbad. But there 's a lot of misinformation in that book that we just didn't understand. And like I say, it 's just taking entirely too long. Like I say, they tell you when you file, it should be over within ayear of the process. Mr. B URTON . And it 's taken 6 years? Mr. R OGERS . Yes, sir. It 's not. Mr. B URTON . But the special master, and the initial decision was that she be compensated and you be compensated for her injury? Mr. R OGERS . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . And the Justice Department has appealed it? Mr. R OGERS . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . OK. I see that my time has expired. Mr. Tierney. Mr. T IERNEY . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for having these hearings. I want to thank all of you for testifying. Any of usthat have lost family know how difficult it is. I have to tell you, I am appalled at just thinking what you 've been through in terms of time, whether your claim was ultimatelyrejected or allowed. The amount of time that you 're talking about is just incomprehensible. I 've done product liability cases in half the time of what you 're talking about, the conclusion. So you have my sympathies on that. I look forward to later testimony and laterhearings and then some legislation, perhaps, something that re- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May that aspect without getting into who 's right or who 's wrong. It 's just beyond comprehension. Let me start from left to right if I could. Ms. Zuhlke, you had an attorney named Mr. Shoemaker? Ms. Z UHLKE . That 's correct. Mr. T IERNEY . Was he an experienced attorney in matters of this kind? Ms. Z UHLKE . Apparently, he was. Again, I found an article in our local newspaper, a family that had been affected. I tracked themdown and spoke with the mother who again provided me with in-formation concerning Mr. Shoemaker. Mr. T IERNEY . He was aggressive on your behalf, he was a good advocate? Ms. Z UHLKE . I believe so, yes, sir. Mr. T IERNEY . And you have no complaints about his perform- ance? Ms. Z UHLKE . No, sir, I don 't. Mr. T IERNEY . And he didn 't cause the delays of which you com- plained? Ms. Z UHLKE . Not that I am aware of. Mr. T IERNEY . Mr. Rogers, did you have an attorney? Mr. R OGERS . Yes, sir, I sure do. Mr. T IERNEY . And was he experienced in matters of this kind? Mr. R OGERS . Very. Mr. T IERNEY . And did he cause any of the delays or problems that you had in getting attention to your claim? Mr. R OGERS . No, sir. He wanted to get as much information as possible before he could really go before anybody. But the onlyproblem with finding attorneys for this situation, to my under-standing, this is like a specialized field, you just don 't go to your local bar association. He did, and they said, they got the program,but they said, we can 't handle anything like this, it 's way above our head. So Mr. Ron Homer is my attorney from Boston. And we finally got in touch with him and said he has been dealing with this thelast few years. Mr. T IERNEY . Well, if he 's from Boston, I can tell you, he 's prob- ably a good guy. [Laughter.] Mr. Sword, you also had an attorney with some experience?Mr. S WORD . Actually, I had a series of attorneys. I began with an attorney that I had a relationship with for a number of yearsin the community. They were part of a firm that is recognized asbeing one of the better law firms in the central part of Ohio. Theydid a referral to a firm in Chicago that had the case for, I don 't know, maybe a year or two. There were some problems within thatfirm and the case ended up also in Ron Homer 's firm in Boston when it was sent back to the firm in Columbus. And they located Ron Homer, and I can tell you without hesi- tation that is excellent representation. I would recommend him toanyone. Mr. T IERNEY . Have you been able to get any assistance in com- pensating your counsel during this period of time? Mr. S WORD . Actually, the limits were the limits. As far as I know, I provided staff with a copy of a letter that was sent to me VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May did settle that stated that the actual costs of the law firm was probably twice, over twice the allowable limit. They said it wasover $60,000 and the cap was $30,000. So they lost a considerable amount of money on that case. In ad- dition to that, we went well over the expense allowances, and Ipaid additional expense allowances out of awards as I agreed to be-fore the case was actually resolved. I agreed to go ahead and dothat. Mr. T IERNEY . In terms of your expert witnesses, am I right in as- suming that all of you relied on your counsel to identify and engageexpert witnesses on your behalf? Mr. S WORD . I did. Mr. T IERNEY . Mr. Rogers, you did the same? Mr. R OGERS . Yes, sir. Mr. T IERNEY . Ms. Zuhlke, of course you did the same? Ms. Z UHLKE . Absolutely. I didn 't know where to go. Mr. T IERNEY . Ms. Zuhlke, let me ask you something. I 'm curious from your comments. You indicated that the last two masters thatyou had were good and you were happy to have their assistance. Ms. Z UHLKE . Yes, sir, that 's correct. Mr. T IERNEY . What did they do that made them better than the first two? What were the differences and why were you unhappywith the first two masters? Ms. Z UHLKE . I think they moved things along, that was basically, I had a sense of, let 's get going. Mr. T IERNEY . Progress? Ms. Z UHLKE . Right. And I didn 't have that, again, the first was John Edwards, who no longer is with the DOJ, I believe he 's with HHS. Useless, basically, sir. Mr. T IERNEY . I think from your testimony it was pretty clear that you thought that they were getting continuances without mak-ing any particular showing for extraordinary need for more time? Ms. Z UHLKE . That 's correct. Mr. T IERNEY . Was that your experience, Mr. Rogers? Mr. R OGERS . Well, in my wife 's case, we had to have the phone conference deal with the special master, Government and our law-yer, everybody there. See, my wife is a registered pharmacist. Sheknows more, I 'm not trying to be insulting, more than any physi- cian in this whole country. She knows every drug, the whole nineyards, everything. And she just was sitting there laughing thewhole time at the explanations they were giving of what was wrongwith her, which didn 't make any sense. The things that they were saying is not possible of what happened to her. Now, she 's not a dummy, she understands every medical term, everything. Because a pharmacist is about as close to being a doc-tor as you can get. It was just comical the way they were tryingto bullskate us with her problem. It just wasn 't very professional. Another thing, the doctor that the Government had diagnosed her kind of like as having MS, which they treated her as, being shedoesn 't have it. I always thought a physician had to at least look at her or touch her to give a diagnosis. You don 't give a diagnosis on the telephone. I mean, that 's\u2014even though he was giving his ex- pert testimony, a physician should at least look at you, or at leastmeet you or something. You just don 't do it over the telephone. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May I want to thank all three of you. My time is up, but I do appreciate how difficult it was for you. We 're very grateful that you came here today. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Tierney. We look forward to work- ing with you on this. Dr. Weldon.Dr. W ELDON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Janet, in your negotiations that are underway, will you be able to get any compensation for lost wages? Ms. Z UHLKE . No, sir. Dr. W ELDON . Can you give us some kind of an impression of how this tragedy has affected your ability to work, how much lost wageshave you incurred? I know you 've had a lot of out of pocket ex- penses. Can you give us a feeling for how much you 've lost because you haven 't been able to work? Ms. Z UHLKE . Well, obviously, that would be in the thousands, sir. When Rachel Anne winds up in the hospital, it can be for 2 to 3weeks at a time. And I am her primary caregiver. I do stay withthe child. And again, I 'm away from home. I 've got to make ar- rangements for my other two children to either stay with family orfriends. I did lose my job over this. I was a dental assistant with ex- panded duties. And I had worked for 15 years for a pedodontist,which is a children 's dentist. And Dr. Vann had to let me go, un- derstandably. I was unemployed for probably throughout 1990. Itwas just a hellatious year, just back to back issues for RachelAnne. Then I went to work for my family, who showed me grace.And even on a Friday when I might not be there, because I wasup at the hospital with Rachel, a check would be put into my ac-count to cover my family 's needs. My mother has cancer and my parents sold the business in No- vember of this past year, a business that we had had for 23 years.I went back into the dental field, I 'm working as a surgical assist- ant now to a maxillofacial oral surgeon. And again, I 'm working on a part-time basis. Rachel Anne is picked up at the end of my driveway by a special bus that takes her off to school and I have to make sure that she 's taken care of. And again, I have no help. I don 't have respite care or anybody else that comes in to help with meeting her needs. I 've got to be there to get her off of the bus. Dr. W ELDON . So when the settlement is finally reached, and you're in the negotiations phase for that, it will be for her care, you get nothing? Ms. Z UHLKE . That 's correct. Dr. W ELDON . You said in the written testimony, I 'm not sure if you mentioned this, that you had a life planner come in and theDOJ life planner has not contacted you yet? Ms. Z UHLKE . That 's correct. Dr. W ELDON . But you made a very interesting statement in your written testimony. You said the DOJ life planner that 's been as- signed your case is ''known in the trade to be confrontational and to under-value costs. '' Can you explain to the committee how you were provided that information? Ms. Z UHLKE . Yes. VerDate of that information you received? Ms. Z UHLKE . Yes, sir. The information came through Rachel 's at- torney. They have had to deal with this individual through theDOJ before. So they have past experiences with her. Also, the indi-vidual that has been employed now by myself, and again throughCliff Shoemaker, to come in as the life care planner on Rachel 's be- half, gave me a heads up, so that I would have a clear understand-ing of what I was coming up against. And now it 's the nickel and dime you to death. For every dime that Rachel 's physicians will say to the life care planner will be necessary to meet my daughter 's needs, apparently the DOJ side will come in and say, no, 2 cents is going to cover that. So now thisis going to be another ongoing battle, is the way I perceive it. Ihave great faith in the people that have taken care of Rachel 's needs at this point. I have no reason not to take them at their wordon this level. Dr. W ELDON . Were you advised by your counsel how long this process normally takes to come to an agreement? And does thishave to go before the special master as well? Ms. Z UHLKE . I was not given a timeframe, and yes, it does now again have to go back in front of a special master and anotherhearing. Dr. W ELDON . And another hearing? Ms. Z UHLKE . Correct. Dr. W ELDON . You have no idea how long this will take? Ms. Z UHLKE . No, sir. I anticipated at least a phone call by now, with at least scheduling some sort of a timeframe. Because again,I've got to organize Rachel 's teachers, the guidance counselors have all of her IEPs, individual education plans, so they can track hercourse, make arrangements with her PCP so that his time is free,which I 've already done that for Ms. Arnold. Dr. W ELDON . PCP? Ms. Z UHLKE . Primary care physician. Dr. W ELDON . Would you explain to the members what that is? Ms. Z UHLKE . I'm sorry. A PCP is a primary care physician. Dr. W ELDON . So the doctor has to get involved with the life care planner? Ms. Z UHLKE . Absolutely. Because he is her care giver. And he understands where she 's been, where she 's at and where she 's going. Dr. W ELDON . So you 've already gone through this whole process with your life care planner, and now you have to go through thisagain with all the parties involved? Ms. Z UHLKE . Yes, sir. Dr. W ELDON . The pediatrician and everybody? Ms. Z UHLKE . Yes, sir. Dr. W ELDON . OK. I see that my time is expired, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . We 'll stay with this panel for a while, if you have additional questions. Mr. Duncan.Mr. D UNCAN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me first of all say that my wife and I have four children, and I think anyone who 's ever had children at least greatly sym- pathizes with each of you and what you 've been through. I can also VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May I think it 's almost criminal, or should be, that you 've been put through all these years of having to deal with the bureaucraticdelays and so forth. I know there are exceptions to almost everything, but you know, State courts, despite having much heavier workloads, usually con-clude cases in about half the time on average that the Federal Gov-ernment does. And you know, we see all the time that the least ef-ficient way to handle anything is to have the Federal Governmenthandle it. But I think it 's very sad that people are put through years and years and years of dealing with this program. I think you all should know, too, that most Federal judges and most Federal hearing officers and special masters almost alwaysrule in favor of the Government, because that 's usually the easiest way to deal with things. So you have won big victories, I think, inhaving rulings in your favor. But you know, thinking back to when my children were small, we got all these vaccines, and I had never heard anything aboutthese problems. I think that almost all parents, I would say 99.9percent of parents, don 't know about these things and are con- vinced that they 're doing something good for their children. And I know that it must be especially hard for you all to take, what hap-pened to you, because I 'm sure that you thought you were doing what you should have been doing for your children to make themhealthier. Do you all think that enough is being done now to ensure these vaccines are safe? Do you have an opinion about that? Have youread research, anything about that? Mr. Sword. Mr. S WORD . Well, as I commented in my testimony, there was about 30 years between the time of the first reports of the twindeaths in the mid-1940 's and the time that my daughter died of vaccine injury. My understanding is, there have been many, manydeaths since then. It was my understanding that, I believe it wasan acellular vaccine was developed for pertussis in the early 1980 's, perhaps in Japan. I may stand corrected if I have that informationwrong. But it was not available in this country for a considerableamount of time, and then it was only available as an option. So I don 't think there is enough research, and I don 't think there is enough really known about the problems with vaccine injury andthe experience. Because it just simply isn 't well reported. Mr. D UNCAN . I think the overwhelming majority of the American people don 't even know that this program exists today. And I won- der, I 've seen where there have been 6,000 claims filed. I wonder how many thousands of others there are that have been told thatit was not the vaccine or they didn 't figure it out. Do you all think that's happened or that there are a lot of people who don 't know about this? What do you say about that, Ms. Zuhlke? Ms. Z UHLKE . I think that 's factual. I think people aren 't aware of it. I didn 't know anything about it until Rachel 's pediatrician put me onto this path. And again, I have three children. I must saythat I heard Mr. Sword 's comments before, my children now are past the immunization aspect. So I 'm probably not as informed as I should be in helping other people. I am aware of the fact that at Dr. O 'Hern 's office, Rachel 's physi- cian, everybody that comes in with a child is required to read this VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May that gives all symptoms, side effects, adverse reactions, and they must initial each page, that they have understood clearlywhat could happen to their child. That information is then docu-mented and put into each child 's chart. I think that is extremely helpful. Mr. D UNCAN . Mr. Sword. Mr. S WORD . My suspicion is that this may very well begin in the medical training process, both for doctors and nurses, and that itmay very well be that there is not enough sensitivity on the partof the medical community and the training process to adequatelyensure that either the medical providers or the patients are ade-quately informed in an appropriate way. Not so as to scare people,but to treat them with the care that they really need and to pro-vide to them the information and caution that 's necessary in order to prevent a lot of these things from going well beyond where theymight otherwise go. Mr. D UNCAN . Finally, let me just mention, we 're going to hear on the next panel a witness who will say that the Justice Departmenthandles these cases in a cooperative and non-adversarial fashion,and that they 're much more cooperative than other similar types of cases. I take it none of you have found that to be true, is thatcorrect? Ms. Z UHLKE . That 's correct. And I 'd like to be on that panel in- stead of this one. Mr. D UNCAN . Do you think that some of these companies, that there 's some big money behind some of these companies that produce these vaccines? I mean, so often what we find in thesethings is the money that 's behind it, in other words, they convince the medical establishment that something is good because they 're making huge profits out of it. Do you think that enters in at all? Or why do you think they say the companies are getting out of the vaccine business now, thechildhood vaccine business? Have you looked into that at all? Mr.Sword. Mr. S WORD . I have not looked into that. But I always had the feeling from the people that I came in contact with, and from theattorneys that I came in contact with that there was a giant stand-ing in the shadows of this whole thing, and that that giant had alot of influence. On the other side of that, you have children, youhave a variety of different kinds of people that are mandated as acondition of employment to take these vaccines. You have police-men, firemen, doctors, nurses and so forth who are all, so you havethis balance here. And the Government has to in some way sortthat out. But quite frankly, I just don 't think that the absence of some kind of oversight because of the presence of these vaccine manufac-turers, the possibility of revolving door, and as the chairman statedin his opening statement, the conflicts at the Government agencies,that there could ever be a resolution to this without some kind ofongoing congressional oversight to this. Mr. D UNCAN . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Judge. Let me ask you a question, Mr. Sword. You said that initially somebody said your daughter died of SIDS? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 . That 's correct. And that was a common diagnosis of cause of death, as my understanding was. There were a lot of thesecases that were misdiagnosed from the very beginning as beingSIDS. Mr. B URTON . We have known throughout the country that there were a lot of children that died from SIDS and there 's been some concern that those may not have been just normal ways for chil-dren to die, but that they were as a result of vaccines that weregiven to the children. I think we ought to take a look at that andsee if we can find any statistical data to find out when childrenwho die with SIDS got vaccinations and the proximity of that timeto their death, just to have some statistical data. So can we checkinto that? Let me ask you a couple of questions, Ms. Zuhlke. In his written statement, Mr. Harris, who will be on the next panel, says the Jus-tice Department lawyers are cooperative and non-adversarial. Iknow you 've answered this a little bit. He says the Justice Depart- ment undertakes its responsibilities in a more cooperative mannerthan would be expected from defendants in civil litigation. He alsosays, I do not believe that the manner in which the VICP cases areprocessed has become more adversarial. In fact, I believe it 's quite to the contrary. And would you once more tell me, each one of you, what you think about that statement? Ms. Z UHLKE . Well, sir, I don 't think I can really tell you what I think about that statement, but I don 't think it 's factual. Mr. B URTON . I think you just did. Ms. Z UHLKE . OK, sir. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Rogers. Mr. R OGERS . Well, this whole situation is really hard to under- stand. But I really wish my wife could have come and you couldreally hear it from the horse 's mouth. Because it 's really hard to interpret everything she 's going through. And one thing, I don 't really think the public really knows about this. They just take stuff for granted. I just think a lot of peopleare getting the runaround on this. We 're just not getting anything professional out of it. Mr. B URTON . We 'll try to make sure the public knows more about it. Mr. Sword.Mr. S WORD . I guess it 's depending on how you define cooperative and how you define non-adversarial and so forth and so on. In mycase, I thought it was rather adversarial, to a fault. Other casesthat I 've heard of, similar kinds of things, I 've heard statistics that somewhere around the area of two-thirds of the claims were re-jected for pertussis deaths. So I think on the whole, there may be some effort on the Govern- ment 's part to do that. But I don 't think they 're doing nearly enough, if they are, and they should make a better effort in goodfaith. Mr. B URTON . Ms. Zuhlke, did you ever observe a special master lose his temper or lose his patience with a Justice Department law-yer? Ms. Z UHLKE . Yes, sir. VerDate me what happened. Ms. Z UHLKE . That was in the second hearing. Mr. B URTON . What did he say? Ms. Z UHLKE . I'm sorry, sir, I cannot give it to you verbatim at this point. But some comments were made, and special master didget a little incensed over it. One thing that does stick in my mindis, at the end of that particular hearing, and again this is the sec-ond hearing, the attorney for the DOJ said, ''oh, by the way, there is a piece of evidence that we don 't have. '' And it turns out this piece of evidence he had desired, he 'd known about for 9 years. And now at the end, literally the end, the closure of that hearing, I alsolost my temper. Mr. B URTON . He asked for evidence that had been known for 9 years? Ms. Z UHLKE . Yes, sir, and he said parts of it were not available, it had to do with slides of my daughter 's brain tissue, because she 's had two open brain biopsies. And he was stating that part of thatmaterial had never been received. And the special master wantedto know, well, what took you so long to come up and say some-thing. Now is a very inappropriate time and you may not continuewith trying to obtain that. And the hearing was closed. Mr. B URTON . I'd like to maybe, if you can give us the name of that attorney, I 'd like to check on that. Ms. Z UHLKE . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Sword, did you find the Justice Department to be cooperative and non-adversarial in your case? Mr. S WORD . I didn 't feel that they were cooperative. I felt that it was, they came with three different causes of death that didn 't agree with one another. We got into the hearing in Boston and theyhad an expert there who kept nodding out in the first part of theproceedings. As she proceeded into her testimony, this woman kind of led to a fantasy testimony, that if there had been the technology at thetime of Natalie 's death that existed now, she could have made a different diagnosis. And I don 't know how you deal with that kind of a fantasy when you 're talking about facts and when you 're talk- ing about what was available in the records and so forth. I kind of sat back in my chair and I started to listen to this, and quite frankly, it upset me so bad that I had to leave the room. Ileft the room. Mr. B URTON . So you don 't think she had the expertise necessary to actually make comments? Mr. S WORD . I think some of these people come in there, and they make their living doing adverse testimony, quite frankly. Mr. B URTON . How about you, Mr. Rogers? Mr. R OGERS . Well, I know they 've got their job to do, but it 's\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Well, you were in meetings with these people. What kind of response did you have in the meetings? Mr. R OGERS . Well, we just did not understand what they were going after. I mean, I know my wife being an adult, which is totallydifferent than a child having this problem, they kept going back tothings that had happened to her years prior to anything. Like shehad vertigo at one time, they said, well, if you have a tetanus shot VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May vertigo, you 're going to have MS and blah, blah, blah, which is not really true. With her expertise as far as medicine, she just didn 't believe half the stuff they were telling us. But the special master, evidentlyshe's got a lot of medical knowledge, because she knew exactly what was going on. But she was supposed to have been the decid-ing factor in all this. Mr. B URTON . My time 's just about up. Did you think that the Government was trying to disprove your case? They weren 't trying to work with you? Were they working with you or were they tryingto disprove your case? Mr. R OGERS . I really believe they were just trying to disprove it. They just didn 't believe it was true. Mr. B URTON . How about you, Mr. Sword? Mr. S WORD . I don 't think there was any question that was what was at the core of what motivated them. They were attempting asdesperately as they could to disprove that case. Mr. B URTON . Ms. Zuhlke. Ms. Z UHLKE . Same exact thing. That 's exactly my words. That works for me. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Tierney, do you have any questions? Mr. T IERNEY . No, thank you. They 've been through enough. Thank you. Mr. B URTON . I think that suffices. If you have any additional comments you 'd like to make to the committee, we 'd like to have those. We 're going to have, when we come back from votes, we 've got a series of votes, we 're going to have the other panel from the Justice Department and HHS. If you 'd like to stay around, we might solicit some comments from you at the conclusion of their re-marks. And with that, we stand in recess until the fall of the gavel, which should be in just a few minutes after the final vote. I thinkhave two or three votes. So it will probably be half an hour beforewe get back. [Recess.]Mr. B URTON . I again call the committee to order. We'll now hear testimony from the second witness panel. Thomas Balbier and John Euler, would you please approach the committeetable? Oh, Mr. Harris, excuse me. Mr. Harris. [Witnesses sworn.]Mr. B URTON . Which one of you replaces Mr. Euler? I guess Mr. Harris does. Do you have opening statements? We 'll start with you, Mr. Balbier. STATEMENTS OF THOMAS E. BALBIER, JR., DIRECTOR, NA- TIONAL VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM, AC-COMPANIED BY GEOFFREY EVANS, MEDICAL DIRECTOR,AND DAVID BENOR, OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL;AND PAUL CLINTON HARRIS, SR., DEPUTY ASSISTANT AT-TORNEY GENERAL, CIVIL DIVISION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OFJUSTICE Mr. B ALBIER . Good afternoon, Mr. Burton. VerDate and members of the committee, I 'm very pleased to be here this morning to talk to you about the National VaccineInjury Compensation Program. The National Vaccine Injury Com-pensation Program provides a unique service to families sufferingthrough one of the most difficult experiences imaginable. It makesa system available through which families can receive financialhelp quickly, while still preserving their rights to file suit in thetort system. The program significantly reduces, but cannot eliminate, the ten- sion and adversity inherent with any litigation process for resolv-ing claims. I heard members discuss earlier this morning that Iwould be coming here and talking about a system that was non-adversarial. You will not hear me say that. I 've been saying for years that the system is designed to be less adversarial than thetort system that people otherwise would have to go through. Andit is. I was asked specifically to address three major issues in my testi- mony this morning. They are complaints that the statute of limita-tions is too narrow and excludes families from the program, com-plaints that the inability to make interim payments to petitionersplaces them at a disadvantage, and complaints that the programhas, in general, become too litigious and adversarial. We have attempted to address these issues through a wide vari- ety of methods. In June 1999, a draft bill entitled the ''Vaccine In- jury Compensation Program Amendments of 1999 '' was sent to Congress. This proposed bill contains specific legislative proposalsthat addressed each one of these issues noted above. I also heard earlier a recommendation that there should be an independent group to provide oversight for the compensation pro-gram. That group exists. Those recommendations came from thatgroup. We developed the proposals based on recommendations fromthe Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, comprised ofmedical professionals with expertise in pediatrics, attorneys, in-cluding those representing families filing claims under the pro-gram, and equally important, parents of children injured by veryrare, but serious adverse reactions to childhood vaccines. One of these proposals would extend the current statute of limi- tations from 3 years for injury claims and 2 years for death claimsto 6 years for those claiming injury or death resulting from a cov-ered vaccine. Another proposal would permit the interim paymentof litigation costs after a determination that the petitioner is enti-tled to compensation. Another would allow compensation for familycounseling and costs to families related to establishing a guardian-ship or a conservatorship. Other proposed legislative changes would address the rule- making process for changes to the vaccine injury table. Currently,the process for changing the table requires a period of 180 days forpublic comment, including the opportunity for a public hearing.During the last public hearing for proposed changes to the table,no member of the public attended the hearing. Decreasing thelength of time for public comment and eliminating the mandate fora public hearing will enable the program to make needed changesincluding the addition of injuries to the vaccine injury table in amore efficient manner. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 proposals. The statute of limi- tations is extended, potentially enabling more families to seek com-pensation. Also, the proposal recognizes and attempts to ease someof the financial burdens of petitioners. It is critical to rememberthat although the program is far less adversarial than the tort sys-tem, which it was designed to replace, it was established for a veryspecific group of intended beneficiaries. The program encourages anyone who believes they have a condi- tion caused or significantly aggravated by childhood vaccine to filea petition for compensation. Petitioners ' rights, as you heard, are vigorously advocated by their attorneys, who are paid reasonableattorney fees and costs, regardless of whether petitioners are com-pensated, so long as there is a reasonable basis for the claim andit is brought in good faith. However, the program was never intended to serve as a com- pensation source for a wide range of naturally occurring illnessesand conditions, which unfortunately affect many of our children. I also was asked to discuss changes to the vaccine injury table. We have amended the table twice so far, in 1995 and 1997. I spokeextensively to those changes when I testified before in front of thiscommittee. We 've now begun the process of making further changes to the vaccine injury table. The most important of these changesis to add intussusception, the telescoping of the intestine, as an in-jury associated with the rotavirus vaccine. Rotavirus is a childhoodvaccine licensed by the Food and Drug Administration in August1998. A series of reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event ReportingSystem found that some infants developed intussusception after re-ceiving the vaccine. The VAERS system, as we call it, is a signalingsystem that has been set up to monitor adverse events. The Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention, based on this signal thatwe received from the VAERS system, then recommended thathealth care providers and parents postpone the use of rotavirusvaccine while we looked into this further. Shortly thereafter, themanufacturer voluntarily withdrew the vaccine from the market.After consulting with our Advisory Commission on Childhood Vac-cines, we published a notice in the Federal Register on July 13thof this year. The notice would add intussusception as a table injuryusing criteria based on scientific data currently used by HHS andthe Department of Justice for recommendations to the court oncompensation. Already, four claims of intussusception associatedwith the rotavirus have been compensated. In addition, we have taken steps to ensure that potential claim- ants are notified about their ability to file a claim with the pro-gram. We have developed a press release which was distributed onJuly 25th. We participated in a conference call with State and ter-ritorial health officials, asking them to notify all who had reportedintussusception following rotavirus immunization, and we sent afollowup letter also. We 've been publicizing this change on our Web site and through our outreach efforts. All indications are that the program is working very much as in- tended by Congress. The process of determining whether, and atwhat level, compensation should be awarded will always involveconflicting opinions and a natural tension. There will always be VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May that can be improved, and we continue to try to im- plement initiatives to address these areas. The program has always been open to advice from all interested parties, and mechanisms are in place to ensure that varied inter-ests of families, health care professionals, attorneys and the vac-cine industry are represented in a regular public forum. The Advi-sory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, with its widely diversemembership, brings good balance and perspective and has been in-strumental in identifying program improvements that have consen-sus support. The ACCV was established by the act, and I quote from the act, to ''advise the Secretary (of HHS) on the implementation of the pro- gram. '' That 's very broad oversight responsibility. The diverse body has provided constant oversight of the operation of the program,advised the Secretary on each and every modification of the vaccineinjury table, also as required by statute, and has made numerouslegislative and administrative recommendations over the yearsaimed at improving the operation of the program. The ACCV developed and approved legislative proposals that I mentioned previously. The Department remains committed to mak-ing this program and to making ongoing improvements to the pro-gram, so that children and families can reap the benefits of theprogram in, ''the most efficient and fair manner possible. '' Thank you once again for allowing me to come here today to tell you about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. I 'll be pleased to answer any additional questions you may have.Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Mr. H ARRIS . Good afternoon, Chairman Burton and members of the committee. I 'd like to thank you for this opportunity to appear before you this afternoon on behalf of the administration. So that I may limit my remarks, I request that my full written statement and our views letter to you, Mr. Chairman, dated Octo-ber 17th, be entered into the record. In the early 1980 's, Congress faced a looming public health crisis concerning injury from immunizations which involved complex,fiercely debated medical issues overlaid with the emotion of per-sonal loss and tragedy in individual cases. I 've sat through the prior panel, and we 've heard testimony to this effect this morning. In order to stabilize our Nation 's supply of vaccines and promote our universal vaccination policy to combat childhood disease, Con-gress established the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Peti-tioners are afforded under this program a more streamlined systemof recovery with free counsel provided in each case, in which theirmeaningful participation in the process is assured. This supply of life saving vaccines is protected and a safer, better system of vaccines is currently being developed. Vaccines have im-proved the lives of millions of Americans. This program has beena cornerstone of the Nation 's ability to achieve these important ob- jectives. The Justice Department 's role is to implement the statute and to uphold the provisions of the act. By design, this is a program rooted in science. Congress set forth specific eligibility criteria based on the most current and accuratescientific evidence available. We at the Justice Department ensurethat fair compensation is provided to those who meet the eligibilitycriteria determined by Congress and that the vaccine injury trustfund is protected against claims that do not meet this standard. Over the past 5 years, approximately half of all cases have been compensated. The use of alternative dispute resolution has in-creased threefold in the last 2 years. We have initiated efforts tofurther expedite case processing by organizing a group of specialmasters, members of petitioners ' bar, parents and HHS staff to re- view and revise the court 's guidelines for practice. We have supported many legislative proposals that will benefit petitioners, such as an extension of the statute of limitations, andpayment of interim litigation costs, as described in greater detailin our letter to the chairman. We rarely, rarely appeal cases to theCourt of Federal Claims, and even less frequently to the Court ofAppeals for the Federal Circuit. Of the 5,400 cases resolved since 1988, 109 cases have been ap- pealed to the Federal Circuit. The Government has appealed only13 of those cases. Most significantly, since 1993, we 've appealed only one case to the Federal Circuit, and that was 3 years ago, in1998. In consideration of all this, I simply cannot agree with any sug- gestion or accusation that the program has become more litigious. It simply has not. Rather, I think it has become less so. The lan-guage of the act calls for a less adversarial, expeditious and infor-mal proceeding. The Justice Department has gone to great lengthsto fulfill this congressional objective. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 with the court and opposing counsel in developing creative and novel approaches to resolving each claim. As such, theJustice Department has developed a cooperative atmosphere tomove cases along. Our initiatives have contributed to promoting anatmosphere of cooperation among all parties involved. Admittedly, some cases are prolonged or drawn out for various reasons. And you 've heard stories again from families today that il- lustrate such cases. Resolution of cases simply cannot always be ac-complished as quickly as we would prefer. There exists an obvioustension between efficiency and the important principle of due proc-ess. The issues can be difficult and complex. For example, in the enti- tlement phase, the concept of causality can be difficult to prove, asthe Institute of Medicine recognizes, not the Justice Department.The arousal of one 's suspicion that a vaccine might be the cause of an adverse event that occurs within hours, days or weeks follow-ing the receipt of the vaccine is natural and understandable. Butthe mere fact that B follows A does not mean that A caused B. It is for this reason that the act requires scientific evidence that the injury is related to the vaccine, and forbids payment of com-pensation based on the claims of a petitioner alone. We cannot ig-nore the statutory criteria or the consensus of the scientific commu-nity on medical causation issues. With regard to determining compensation to be awarded, Con- gress has set forth a detailed list of categories of compensableitems. The amount sought is frequently in excess of several milliondollars. While often time consuming, the key is that the programprocess is far more thoughtful and tailored as compared with otheralternatives. The goal is no less than establishing a custom tailoredplan of lifetime medical care, and in as many as 90 percent of thecases, this is an issue settled by the parties. In short, I firmly believe that the program is working as de- signed. As with any Government program with specific criteria,there will be applicants who are dissatisfied, even among thosewho are awarded compensation. The debate and the emotion inthese cases will never be eliminated, understandably. But an effi-cient mechanism is in place to address these difficult issues. Todate, almost 1,700 families have been compensated nearly $1.3 bil-lion. This is an outstanding measure of this program 's success. The truth is that these families would have stood little if any chanceof obtaining any relief in the traditional tort system. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I thank you again for this opportunity and I 'll be pleased to answer your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Harris follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 have been filed? Mr. H ARRIS . In the life of the program, there have been roughly 6,000 cases filed. Mr. B URTON . And how many did you settle? Mr. H ARRIS . 5,400 have been adjudicated, and how many have been settled, I couldn 't give you that number. Mr. B URTON . I think you just gave a figure there of 1,000 some- thing, wasn 't it? Mr. H ARRIS . We have paid compensation to 1,700 families. Mr. B URTON . So less than a third have received compensation. Mr. H ARRIS . In the early part of the program, clearly, less, there was a tendency not to pay petitioners. But that percentage hasgone up, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Ah. But there was a tendency not to pay. Mr. H ARRIS . Yes. And we worked closely with your \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . How long have you been doing this, Mr. Harris? Mr. H ARRIS . How long have I been on the job, sir? Mr. B URTON . Yes. Mr. H ARRIS . Since July of this year, sir. Mr. B URTON . Well, where did you get all this expertise? It 's kind of amazing that you have all the answers so quickly, and you 've just done it since July? Mr. H ARRIS . Yes, sir. I do my homework. Mr. B URTON . Oh, OK. That 's very good. I appreciate the opening statements, but what I didn 't hear was any meaningful discussion of what we heard this morning. What do you think about the threefamilies that were here this morning? Mr. H ARRIS . Well \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . I mean, obviously you 've only been on the job 3 or 4 months. Mr. H ARRIS . Clearly. Mr. B URTON . So maybe you didn 't study these three cases, but they've been going on from 6 to 10 years. Mr. H ARRIS . Actually, I have studied those. Mr. B URTON . Well, then, why were they paid, if there was no merit to their case? Mr. H ARRIS . Two of the cases, as you recognized, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, are cases that are still pendingand\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Why are they pending? Mr. H ARRIS . I cannot comment on specific circumstances of open cases. Mr. B URTON . But they 're being appealed, right? Mr. H ARRIS . Two of the cases this morning are being appealed, that's correct. Mr. B URTON . For a layman like myself, tell me, a special master says they should be paid, right? Mr. H ARRIS . Correct. In certain cases. Mr. B URTON . Yes. And then if the Justice Department doesn 't agree, then they appeal it? Mr. H ARRIS . Correct. Mr. B URTON . I see. Mr. H ARRIS . Rarely. Very rarely do we appeal. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Well, we had two of those cases this morning, did we not? Mr. H ARRIS . That 's correct. Which is why what we heard this morning, as emotionally tragic as those cases are, they 're not a rep- resentative sample of what we deal with. Let me throw out somenumbers. 300 \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Let me just interrupt you real quickly. You say they're not representative of what you deal with, and yet you said there 's been over 6,000 cases filed and you gave compensation to less than a third of that. Now, the thing that 's interesting is, and I'll be happy to bring you and Mr. Balbier back here every week or every month if you like and bring three or four more people inand have them testify again and again and again about the short-comings of the system. I 'll be very happy to do that if you guys want to spend the rest of your life before my committee. I don 't have any problem with that. But I see no reason to do that, because we had three examples this morning. What I can 't understand is, why these people have been judged to be in compliance with the statute and should bepaid, one of them is being compensated, and the other two, the spe-cial master agreed, one of them I think had three or four specialmasters, but it has been agreed, and yet the Justice Departmentdecides to appeal the case. Mr. H ARRIS . Mr. Burton, I 'd like to answer the question about appeals. Because one might get the impression that our tendencyis to appeal. And that is not the case. Of the 335 cases that have been appealed to the Court of Federal Claims in the history of the program, for entitlement or damagesissues, the Department has only appealed 57 times. All the otherappeals have been by petitioner. It 's important to know that. Mr. B URTON . What happened on those 57 cases? Mr. H ARRIS . What happened in each case? Mr. B URTON . I mean, how many were settled in favor of the Jus- tice Department and how many were not? Mr. H ARRIS . I'd be happy to get that information for you. Mr. B URTON . Well, wait a minute. You said you 've been studying this issue. Fifty-seven cases have been appealed and you don 't know how many you guys won or lost? Mr. H ARRIS . We have that information but I 'm not a statistician and I can 't spit out every \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . But that 's very important. Mr. H ARRIS . It is important, and I 'd be happy to get that infor- mation. Mr. B URTON . Because if the Justice Department is appealing these cases and you 're not winning, it may be an indication that some of these, the special master may know what they 're doing. And they may be cases that shouldn 't be dragged out for months and years while these people suffer. Let me ask a few questions here. Ms. Zuhlke, she didn 't lose her case. Mr. Sword didn 't lose his case. Mr. Rogers hasn 't lost his case. Do you think that those complaints that you heard this morn-ing were just sour grapes? Mr. H ARRIS . Well, I would respectfully have to say that a charac- terization that they haven 't lost the case would be unfair, because VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May are still pending. And I do not think it 's sour grapes. I think it 's horrible what has happened to these families, and the problem in each of these cases, given the complexities of the medi-cal and scientific issues involved, overlaid with the emotion, is thatno matter how efficient our process is, and respectful of due processrights, given the fact that there is collateral repercussions to theinjuries that are involved, you heard breakup of families, that nomatter how much we compensate these cases, people are going tobe dissatisfied. Mr. B URTON . Let 's go through the process. We have a special master that 's appointed by the court, right? Mr. H ARRIS . Correct. Mr. B URTON . And the special master goes into all the details, looks at the medical evidence, listens to the testimony and every-thing else, and the special master makes a decision, is that correct,after studying the issue, and hearing all the testimony? Mr. H ARRIS . That would be correct, sir. Mr. B URTON . OK. So the special master makes a decision. In sev- eral of those cases, they had more than one special master. Andyou heard the outcomes. The special masters in all three casesagreed that compensation should be paid. You in two cases havedecided to appeal those cases. And those cases have been going onfrom 6 to 10 years. Mr. H ARRIS . Right. And the answer to your question is, there are occasions where we do not agree with the special master. But thereare rarely occasions we don 't agree with the special master that we feel so strongly to take these cases on appeal. In the last 4 years,we've only taken six cases on appeal. There are currently about 700 cases pending. So any impression that we are just willy-nilly takingcases to appeal in an overzealous litigious fashion would be unfair. Mr. B URTON . Excuse me, now, Ms. Zuhlke 's case is not being ap- pealed. And the Sword case was appealed but you lost. So two ofthe three \u2014\u2014 Mr. H ARRIS . Correct. Mr. B URTON [continuing]. Have been appealed, but they 've been settled. So the third one is the only one that 's on appeal now, right? Mr. H ARRIS . I said two were appealed, correct. Mr. B URTON . Two were appealed but you lost one of them, right? Mr. H ARRIS . One of the cases is still pending. One we lost, the Sword case is a closed case. Mr. B URTON . You lost. Mr. H ARRIS . Correct. We appealed that case from the special master to the Court of Federal Claims. Mr. B URTON . Does it bother you when you appeal a case like that and you lose? Does it bother you that you dragged a case on for6 or 8 years? And when Congress passed this, you know, you statedthe intent of Congress, I was here. I was one of the people that wasinvolved in the decisionmaking process to pass that legislation. Andit was our intent to make this much less adversarial for people whohad to go through the trauma of having a child or a sibling or awife or husband injured. And that 's why we got the drug companies off the hook, so they wouldn 't be sued and have endless litigation, so they could produce these pharmaceutical supplies. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May intention of Congress, as I recall, because I was here, and you've only been there 3 or 4 months, was that we make this very, a lot less adversarial. As I said, I 'll be happy to bring before this committee as many people as you want. I could bring maybe 50,100 people at different times to tell you about situations like weheard this morning. So for you to give the impression to this committee and to the Congress that there 's not a lot of problems out there, there are a lot of problems. And we haven 't brought the attorneys before the committee who have handled these cases. The thing about the at-torneys is, they 're limited, I think it is, to $30,000? Mr. H ARRIS . That is incorrect. Mr. B URTON . How much are they limited to? Is there any limit? Mr. H ARRIS . They 're limited in retrospective cases. But if the cases are not retrospective, meaning the injuries are post-act cases,there is no limit. Mr. B URTON . Well, we had the one case, we heard about a while ago, where the attorney worked for almost 10 years and was given$30,000. Mr. H ARRIS . Mr. Sword 's case. Mr. B URTON . Yes. Mr. H ARRIS . That was a retrospective case. Mr. B URTON . Well, I understand. But the point is, if you 're trying to get a counsel, a legal counsel, to take on a case like this, andthey have to spend 5, 6, 7, 8 years trying to get the case resolved,a retrospective case like you 're talking about, there aren 't many at- torneys that are going to do that, because they 're not going to do it on a pro bono basis, that means no cost basis. They 're going to want a fee. And $30,000 for 10 years on a retrospective case isnothing. Mr. H ARRIS . Mr. Chairman, I couldn 't agree more. But unfortu- nately, we have to abide by what the act tells us we have to abideby. Mr. B URTON . Ah. Mr. B ALBIER . Mr. Burton, I might add that the deadline for filing retrospective claims expired more than 10 years ago. So the cap onattorney fees in cases has not been a problem at all for the pro-gram for well over 10 years. That only applies to the vast majorityof claims that were filed for injuries that occurred prior to 1988,when the program went into effect. Mr. B URTON . Let me get back to that. My time has expired and Dr. Weldon 's been very patient as well as Mrs. Davis, so I 'll let them have some time. Dr. Weldon.Dr. W ELDON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can either of you gentlemen tell me if you 'll be sending some- body down to do the life care plan on Janet Zuhlke 's daughter, Ra- chel? She 's been waiting since July. Is that handled by your office, Mr. Balbier, or you, Mr. Harris? Mr. H ARRIS . I think the policy typically is we don 't assign a life care plan provider until we 've received the life care plan from the petitioner. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 She has sent it to you. In light of the fact that her case has been going on for 12 years, can you get somebody downthere before Thanksgiving? Mr. H ARRIS . Thom, do you want to \u2014\u2014 Mr. B ALBIER . Representative Weldon, one of the initiatives that came out of our advisory commission was the idea that we coulddevelop life care plans using one life care planner for both parties.That is for both the petitioner who has filed a claim, and the Gov-ernment who has to implement the statute. In the cases where we 've been able to use what we call a joint life care planner, that has tremendously helped the resolution ofthe case. And we 've been using them for many years. However, that 's at the beginning of the damages process. If the family and their attorney agrees with the concept of using one lifecare planner, it goes very, very quickly. Dr. W ELDON . Well, we heard testimony from her, she 's lost a job, she can 't work, she 's had tremendous out of pocket expenses, it 's been going on for 12 years, she hasn 't heard a word since July. I 'm just asking you a simple question, can you ask somebody in youroffice to call her and set up an appointment to get the life careplanner down there? You can 't answer that question? Why not? Mr. B URTON . Are you asking that question of Mr. Balbier? Dr. W ELDON . Yes. Mr. B ALBIER . I'd like to answer that, actually. It does seem like a very simple question. The honest answer is, there may be a lifecare planner on the way right now. I honestly don 't know. No, I can't answer that question. But we can find out. Dr. W ELDON . Who makes the decision? Who decides when some- body goes down to Florida and \u2014cat got your tongue? You 're looking at me like \u2014whose office? Is it Justice or is the vaccine program? Mr. B ALBIER . While the damages negotiations are underway. The Department of Justice trial attorneys handle most of that. We offerassistance wherever possible. And again, there would be no needfor a life care planner to go down there had we been able to go withjust one. That really helps resolve cases quickly. And we 've had many cases resolved that way. Dr. W ELDON . So you 're saying you may accept the plan that she submits rather than send another person down and negotiate theplan? Mr. B ALBIER . Mr. Weldon, what I 'm saying is that \u2014\u2014 Dr. W ELDON . The reason you 're not responding to me, is it be- cause this is all in negotiations? Is that \u2014\u2014 Mr. B ALBIER . Well, as you know, with any case that 's under liti- gation, you can never comment on negotiations. This is litigation.We try to make it a less adversarial process. Dr. W ELDON . Let me just ask you a very bland question. Can you try to expedite this case in the months ahead? Is there a place inyour heart to find a willingness to expedite this case? Mr. B ALBIER . We try to expedite every case. When I first saw, and it was just yesterday, which witnesses would be here testify-ing, which families, I recognized the names. I recognized them, al-though I didn 't know immediately why. When I looked into it, I re- membered that the Zuhlke 's case was one of the lengthiest proceed- ings in the history of the compensation program. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May in the Sword case stand out, when you first see them, you think, why would the Government ever appeal this case. Andthen when I heard of the other witness, that name was also famil-iar, Rogers. That was familiar most recently, because CongressmanBurton asked me about that case. Dr. W ELDON . Let me ask you another question. She has \u2014\u2014 Mr. H ARRIS . I may be able to help you out here, if you 'd like. Dr. W ELDON . OK, go ahead. If you can make it quick. Mr. H ARRIS . Yes. I did not come prepared to discuss specific de- tails of the Zuhlke case, but I can assure you that I will have oneof our attorneys contact her attorney by tomorrow. And I 'll be happy to get back with you on that. Dr. W ELDON . I would like another assurance from you, that you will not seek any retribution against this lady and her family basedon the testimony she has provided here. Mr. H ARRIS . Let me make clear, the Justice Department never seeks retribution. In fact, we find it offensive for folks to character-ize honest Federal Government employees as seeking retributionagainst U.S. citizens who have suffered such a loss, and wewouldn 't do that. Dr. W ELDON . Mr. Harris \u2014\u2014 Mr. H ARRIS . We have never done that and there is no evidence to support that. Dr. W ELDON . You draw your employees from the ranks of the human race. And you may be a very, very nice person, as may beMr. Balbier. But as we all know, dealing with every Federal agen-cy, there are occasionally some people who will do things like that.So I would just ask that you would take some personal interest inthis matter to make sure personally that nothing of that naturehappens. Mr. H ARRIS . I will take a personal interest in this matter, and I can assure you that in any instance where there is an allegationthat our attorneys are acting in any untoward fashion \u2014\u2014 Dr. W ELDON . I'm not saying there 's any allegation. I 'm just, I 'm a little concerned, because she has said some things here that a lotof people would be afraid to say. Mr. H ARRIS . I understand that, and I 'm sensitive to that, and I 'll look into it and make sure that her attorneys are contacted. ButI have to reiterate, there is no tendency on the Justice Departmentofficials to seek retribution against citizens. If you have evidenceinto that, I 'd love to have it. Dr. W ELDON . No, I don 't have any evidence of that. I 'm just being cautious. Thank you. Mr. B URTON . I'll be glad to talk to you about a few cases after we adjourn, because there has been some cases of what I wouldconsider retribution I think you probably ought to be aware of. The other thing I 'd like to say before I yield to Ms. Davis is this. You're going to respond to Ms. Zuhlke 's problem by calling tomor- row. What about the other people that we can bring in, and I 'm sure that there 's probably over 100 or maybe more, that would re- quire the same kind of attention that haven 't received it? Should we give you a list of those so that you can respond to those quickly? Mr. H ARRIS . Mr. Chairman, if you have a list of folks that we haven 't contacted in months, I 'd love to have a list of those folks. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May 're going to get it. Mr. H ARRIS . I appreciate that. Mr. B URTON . I will have that for you. And since you 've been on the job a short time, I think that maybe you are going to be ableto make a difference, and I 'll get you that list. Mrs. Davis.Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Harris, I know you 've only been on the job since July. Mr. Balbier, how long have you been involved in this? Mr. B ALBIER . For a little over 11 years, I 've been the Director of the program. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . So you 're pretty familiar with all three of these cases, then. Mr. B ALBIER . No, I 'm not. I was familiar with the histories. The names were familiar when I first heard of them. And again, thatwas only just yesterday when I saw the witness list. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . But you made a comment a minute ago that based on the facts, you had to wonder why the Justice Depart-ment appealed, I think it was Mr. Sword 's, is who you said. Mr. B ALBIER . Well \u2014\u2014 Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . That was the one, if I 'm not mistaken \u2014\u2014 Mr. B ALBIER . That wasn 't\u2014\u2014 Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . Let me finish. That was the one, if I 'm not mistaken, that they just said that it was appealed and it waslost. So who makes the decision to appeal? Does HHS recommendit or does DOJ look at it and make the determination? Who makesthat determination? Mr. B ALBIER . That 's an excellent question. We make the deter- mination together. However, it 's really up to the Department of Health and Human Services. We are the ones who are responsiblefor administering this program. Our pediatricians are the initial re-viewers of cases after they 're filed. They make recommendations to the court. They first prepare a medical report. And then in cases where we concede they 've met the criteria of the statute, we move immediately to damages negotiations. Andwe've had cases resolved in as little as 97 days. But in cases where they don 't meet the criteria of the statute, that 's where problems arise. People, honest, reasonable people, good families, have verydifferent opinions on injuries that are surrounding the administra-tion of vaccines, and whether they seemingly are caused by vac-cines. And as I said, with the Zuhlke case, I remember that case years ago when we first got a congressional inquiry on that case. Andthat was my reaction, why did we appeal that case? It wasn 't fresh in my memory. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . The Zuhlke case or the Sword case? Mr. B ALBIER . No, the Zuhlke case. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . But did you not say a minute ago when you were talking that on the face of it, you didn 't understand why the Sword case was appealed. I believe that 's what you said. Mr. B ALBIER . OK, I 'm trying to remember what the \u2014\u2014 Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . Mr. Sword. The one that was appealed and was won. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May It's the Sword case, you 're right. It 's the Sword case I 'm thinking of, that 's correct. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . It was appealed, and you lost when you appealed it. So I guess my question is, I 'm assuming then that HHS rec- ommended to DOJ \u2014\u2014 Mr. B ALBIER . That 's exactly how it works. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA [continuing]. To appeal. But you 're with HHS. Mr. B ALBIER . That 's right. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . You just said that when you looked at the facts of the case, you had to wonder why it was appealed. Mr. B ALBIER . I raised the question, why did we appeal. I looked into it and I had a very good answer to that question. My stafffilled me in. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . I'd like to hear it. Mr. B ALBIER . I'd like to be able to tell you that. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . OK. Mr. B ALBIER . That case is in litigation and I can 't. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . I thought you just said it was lost. Mr. B ALBIER . That case is still in litigation. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . Did you not just say that the Sword 's appeal was lost? Mr. B ALBIER . As far as we 're concerned, all these cases are in litigation. And we cannot discuss them. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . Mr. Chairman, I 'm sort of confused here. Mr. B ALBIER . If the gentlelady would yield, as I understand it, they're in litigation not on the outcome but on the amount of com- pensation, is that correct? Mr. B ALBIER . As I said, I cannot discuss these cases, they 're on appeal. I can 't discuss what the issues are in these cases. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . But I believe \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Excuse me. The Sword case you can 't discuss, even though that 's been completed? Mr. B ALBIER . The case actually has not been completed. I don 't believe that case has been paid, has it? Mr. B URTON . The money 's been paid, has it not? Dr. W ELDON . The Sword case is a closed case, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . And you can 't comment on that, Mr. Balbier? You can't comment on the Sword case? Mr. B ALBIER . I did not come here prepared to comment on the Sword case, specifics of that case. As I said, I didn 't know that \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Well, I want you to know that you guys are going to be up here more than you ever dreamed you were going to beup here if you don 't cooperate with this committee. And hiding be- hind a case that you say is ongoing and you can run it on for 8or 10 years is not going to be acceptable. Now, I hope you get usedto looking at me, because you 're going to be up here a lot. And if you don 't want to come, I 'll subpoena you. And if I have to go to Tommy Thompson and have him bring you up here, I 'll do it. This is ridiculous. The gentlelady 's time \u2014I'm sorry. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 OF VIRGINIA . That 's OK, Mr. Chairman. I guess what concerns me, Mr. Balbier, is you 're sitting here stating that you cannot comment on a case, yet you yourself without being askedthe question commented on the case a minute ago when Represent-ative Weldon was speaking. You said that when you looked at thatcase, you couldn 't understand why it was appealed. Mr. B ALBIER . That is correct. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . Then you answered the chairman that the appeal had been lost. So I guess I 've got a real problem as to why you make a comment that you don 't understand why you ap- pealed it \u2014\u2014 Mr. B ALBIER . I got \u2014\u2014 Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA [continuing]. You just answered me that HHS makes the \u2014\u2014 Mr. B ALBIER . I was simply confused between the two cases. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . Well, if you 've got your memory back now, can you tell me why you appealed it? Mr. B ALBIER . I didn 't come here prepared to discuss the merits of that case. Mr. H ARRIS . I might be able to help. Mr. B ALBIER . I don 't have the specifics in front of me. We can, if you would like, we can provide for the record the case history ofthat case and why it was appealed. And the issues involved. Theyare complex. Mr. H ARRIS . I'd like to be able to help answer some of your ques- tions, if you would permit me to do so. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . That would be fine. Mr. H ARRIS . Just to clear up where we are with the three cases that we heard from this morning, the Sword case, to my under-standing, if I recall correctly, is a closed case and payment wasmade on that case, I believe, in August 1999. There 's one case pending on damages, which is the Zuhlke case, and there 's another, the Rogers case is pending on appeal. So if you have questionsabout the Sword case, I think I 'd feel comfortable in answering those questions. If your question is, why was that case appealed, it was appealed because we disagreed with the theory used by the special masterin determining that case, because it was a theory that was not dis-cussed in the litigation process. Because it was not discussed in thelitigation process, we did not have our opportunity to present ourside of her theory. Once the special master made a decision, we tried to introduce evidence that would in effect present our side of what her theoryturned out to be. She decided not to hear that, we appealed to theCourt of Federal Claims. The Court of Federal Claims agreed withthe special master, and we decided not to take it any further. Sothat's where that case ended. I think it would be safe to say that because of the appeals taken in the Sword case it was protracted out over months. However,once the decision was made by the Court of Federal Claims in June1999, payment was made to the family by August of that year. Mrs. D AVIS OF VIRGINIA . Thank you, Mr. Harris. I don 't know if it 's appropriate to make this comment, Mr. Chair- man, but I 'm going to, and you can call me down if I 'm incorrect. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May the petitioners feel an adver- sarial role from the Government, because I felt an adversarial rolefrom you when you responded to me. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B ALBIER . I apologize if you felt that way. That was not my intent. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Platts, I 'm sorry, I didn 't see you. Do you have any questions? Mr. P LATTS . Actually just one to followup, Mr. Chairman. Mrs. Davis, it sounded like, Mr. Balbier, that you have an an- swer. I understand you didn 't come prepared to get into specifics. But it sounded like you have an answer to the question about theappeal when you asked and you looked at it and you were givenan answer, but you didn 't think you could share it, because that was a pending case. Now that we have resolved that is a closedcase, the answer that you apparently wanted to give but thoughtyou couldn 't, it seems like you can now give. So I'd be interested in hearing that answer. Mr. B ALBIER . I think in the Sword case the medical issues were very complex. I had them explained to me very late last night bymy medical staff. And I understood them at the time, and I under-stood why we appealed the case and I understand that there wasconfusion, or misinterpretation of the findings of the medical ex-perts in those cases. And we decided to appeal that case based onthe interpretation of the statute by the special master. Mr. P LATTS . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. W ELDON [assuming Chair]. The Chair now yields to himself 5 minutes for a second round of questions. Mr. Balbier, you said in your testimony that you have done a lot to let people know about the program. Have you done a study ora poll to see what is the level of awareness on the part of the publicof the vaccine compensation program? Specifically, parents ofnewborns. Mr. B ALBIER . We have not done any studies to date to do that. Dr. W ELDON . I would recommend you do so. Because one of the themes I 've heard over and over again is that people hadn 't heard about the program. I think we would be well served to get somesort of measure, objective measure of what the level of awarenessis. It may help us in the Congress to work with your agency toraise the level of public awareness. I also want to say to you that I appreciate the endorsement of many of the provisions of the legislation introduced by Congress-man Nadler of New York and myself, H.R. 1287. Would you be will-ing to commit to sit down with my staff or members of your staffwith my staff to see if we can work out acceptable language to theadministration on some of these reforms that both CongressmanNadler and you and I would like to see moved forward on? Mr. B ALBIER . We 'd be happy to do that. Dr. W ELDON . Thank you. I will have my staff set up a time for that. I personally believe we should be able to pass these reformsin a bipartisan fashion. Mr. Harris, as I understand it, if a family retains an attorney and puts in a claim, it goes before the program and the programhas pediatricians, basically, that analyze the merits of the case, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May the decision is made by the vaccine program managers to deny compensation, it 's turned over to you and then you oppose set- tlement. And if these cases go before the special master, you actu-ally have the ability to bring in experts, is that correct? Mr. H ARRIS . That 's correct. Dr. W ELDON . OK. Mr. H ARRIS . And petitioners, I might add, have that as well. One of the problems that petitioners face, once they pass the eligibilityphase, or the fact that they are eligible for the program, is the ex-pense involved in hiring experts. And we 're sensitive to that. If your bill proposes to provide some fees to help in that, that wouldbe something that we would certainly support. Dr. W ELDON . OK. That was the kind of answer I was hoping to get. That 's a complaint I 've heard over and over again, that some of these attorneys are big-hearted enough to just wait and wait andwait years and years to get their payments. But it 's impossible for them to be paying out for these experts. I was very, very disturbed in reviewing the case of Ms. Zuhlke, these repeated delays from DOJ. No explanation at some of thesehearings why they were asking for continuance. Some of these con-tinuances going on as long as 9 months is what my constituentcomplained to me. The impression I get, just from listening to her,I'm reading between the lines here, it was often just the case, the attorneys were not prepared. I don 't believe that is acceptable at all. You said you took this job in July. What did you do prior to July? Mr. H ARRIS . I practiced law, and I was also a State legislator in the great Commonwealth of Virginia. Dr. W ELDON . Wonderful. I think we 've met before, haven 't we? Mr. H ARRIS . I don 't think so. Dr. W ELDON . Quite all right. You didn 't practice specifically med- ical malpractice or medical defense, did you? Mr. H ARRIS . No, Congressman. My practice was primarily labor and employment law, although I 'm familiar with medical mal- practice issues. Dr. W ELDON . OK. Mr. H ARRIS . I would add that, I would hope that I 'd have, and I think I do, a Congressman who is as interested in representingtheir constituents as obviously you are for Ms. Zuhlke. I would findit unacceptable for a lengthy, unnecessary, unsubstantiated delaysin cases, and I want to assure you that I will look into that. I also think the point that you made about making sure that par- ents are aware of this program is a very good point. For our part,our attorneys and HHS officials, we regularly attend conferences,both in the legal community, and medical community, to try tomake sure that information about the program gets out to the gen-eral public. We distribute packets with information in it. This year, we attended 11 such conferences, and certainly hope to improve on that number next year. But your point about makingsure that families who are not aware of this program become awareof it is a well taken point. To the extent we can help with that kindof outreach, we welcome that opportunity. Dr. W ELDON . Well, the reason I was asking you about your back- ground is, maybe as you were made aware earlier, I 'm a physician. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May medicine for 15 years before I was elected to the House of Representatives. I happen to know the pediatrician pretty wellwho takes care of her daughter. He 's a Duke graduate, he 's a really smart guy. And when she first brought her case to me, I actuallyread the chart. And you screwed up, basically, in my opinion, on this case. Un- less you 've got information that you 're not revealing, dragging this one on for 12 years is really bad. It makes the program look bad,it makes the Congress look bad. And I would highly encourage youto come to an expeditious resolution of this case. I 'm certainly look- ing forward to working with you in the weeks and months ahead,in crafting ways that we can try to improve the program so thatit better meets the needs and intent of Congress. There 's universal agreement that it 's too adversarial. I under- stand your comments, Mr. Balbier, that the way we wrote the law,it's still adversarial. And I accept the responsibility for us to make it less adversarial. I also recognize the importance that it be based on good, quality medical science. Excuse me 1 second. Today we have heard that some of the special masters ' handling of the compensation cases were frustrated, and/or angry about Jus-tice Department conduct. They made comments like embarrassed,they called prosecutors abrasive, tenacious and obstreperous. Theycalled arguments egregious. Obviously you can see why we are con-cerned. Mr. Harris, do you agree with these observations?Mr. H ARRIS . No. I think that our attorneys do the best job they can. They act professionally, they act with compassion in these pro-grams. But they also have a professional responsibility to abide bythe standard and the criteria set by Congress, which is a prepon-derance of the evidence standard, which means that basically, thecase that the petitioners present only has to tilt just the slightestbit in their favor, in which compensation awards are paid. I know that the remarks that you made there from the special master pertaining to one of our attorneys was, I believe, made inthe Marks case. And I would have to put those remarks into somekind of a context, look into the case and I 'd be happy, again, to get back with you with what we discover. But as a rule or somethingthat happens very infrequently, of course not. Every \u2014\u2014 Dr. W ELDON . Well, when comments are made like that by a spe- cial master, it reflects very, very poorly on the Justice Department.I would hope that you would take appropriate action in your newposition to make sure that you do not have attorneys working foryou that would engage in practices that would precipitate thosekinds of comments by a special master. Mr. H ARRIS . I certainly will do all I can to make sure that kind of conduct obviously does not take place within the Department. Ifeel very comfortable at this point in saying that it doesn 't. I be- lieve that, I mean, you have to put comments into perspective. That same special master who derided our attorney was describedas worthless in the prior panel. Dr. W ELDON . Well, I appreciate your sharing that. And I know the special masters are drawn from the human race as well. But VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May made in the Mann case are not unique. There have been other similar types of complaints. I'd like to now yield to the chairman of the committee, the gen- tleman from Indiana, Mr. Burton. Mr. B URTON [resuming Chair]. Thank you very much, Dr. Weldon. I just had a couple of followups on this question. It says, when you have those kinds of comments made in a hearing where thespecial master says that they 're embarrassed, they call the prosecu- tors abrasive, tenacious, obstreperous, do you guys agree withthose comments that they made? Mr. H ARRIS . I don 't agree with those comments, no. Mr. B URTON . Well, you 're pretty new. Do you agree with these comments? Mr. B ALBIER . I don 't know the context in which those comments were made, Mr. Burton. But I 've known most of the trial attorneys at DOJ for quite a long time. There are some newer attorneys, butmost of them have been with the program for quite some time. Andcertainly my experience has been just the opposite. The attorneys come before our advisory commission, too, and have worked with the commission. The advisory commission hashad the opportunity to meet several of the trial attorneys at theDepartment of Justice over the years. They 've been more than co- operative, and I think represent us quite well before the courts. Ifwe had any concerns about the quality of representation, we wouldhave made those concerns known with the Department of Justice.But we 've never had any problems at all. Mr. B URTON . When a special master makes comments like those, do they have any place to go? Is there any review process? I mean,if they 're talking to somebody over there at your Department or Justice Department and they feel like they 've been meeting with people who are arrogant or obstreperous or abusive, where do theygo? Mr. H ARRIS . Certainly when a special master makes those kinds of comments with respect to a Justice Department lawyer, we re-view it, as we did in this case. Mr. B URTON . Who reviews it? Mr. H ARRIS . The director of the department that oversees the vaccine program, and if necessary, I 'll review it myself. But I can tell you that the special master has recently appointed this particu-lar attorney who is the subject of these derisive comments to bechairman of the process group to work very closely with the specialmasters. Mr. B URTON . Well, that sounds like a step in the right direction. Mr. H ARRIS . A quality individual. Mr. B URTON . How does the VICP select expert witnesses? Do you require them to disclose financial ties, either personal or institu-tional, with vaccine manufacturers or other Government agencies,such as NIH? And that 's very important, because we have been, I have subpoenaed the financial records of a lot of people that areon advisory committees over at HHS and so forth, and we havefound some people who are on these advisory committees who aremaking recommendations on vaccines and so forth that have con-flicts of interest. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 one of the fellow on the rotavirus, one of the peo- ple on the advisory panel that Mr. Balbier referred to regarding therotavirus vaccine, he was the chairman of that committee and hehad a lot of stock in one of the companies that made the rotavirusvaccines. And what you didn 't mention was that although the com- pany withdrew the Rotashield from the market, it was becausethere had been so many adverse reactions and it was less than 1year after it had been put on the market, No. 1. And No. 2, there were several people on the advisory panel that had real reservations about that vaccine ever being put into themarketplace in the first place. Nevertheless, the chairman of thatcommittee had financial ties to a pharmaceutical company and itwas put on the market. One child died and several others had se-vere problems. So we 'd like to ask the same kind of question. Do you require these people who are expert witnesses, do you require them to dis-close financial ties, either personal or institutional, with some ofthese vaccine manufacturers? Mr. B ALBIER . Let me try to answer that question, because you asked about the expert witnesses who testify and also about theadvisory commission members. Mr. B URTON . Well, I didn 't ask about the advisory commission members, because I already know. I 've checked. I 've subpoenaed and got their financial records. They didn 't want to tell me that, like you didn 't want to tell us some things, so I sent a subpoena out and I got the records. We have found, and there are financialrecords, a lot of them were incomplete, which we 're still checking on, we have found that they had financial ties to pharmaceuticalcompanies, and we think that might have tainted their judgmentjust a bit. Nevertheless, we 're talking about these expert witnesses right now. Mr. B ALBIER . No, we don 't require that they fill out any conflict of interest forms at all. Mr. B URTON . Why wouldn 't you think that might taint their judgment just a little bit? Let 's say, for instance, I 'll give you an example, let 's say that a person had strong interest in a pharma- ceutical company that manufactured a product. And that productwas the one that we suspected caused an adverse event in a childwho was vaccinated. Would you think that person would be an un-biased witness? Mr. B ALBIER . I would think that something like that probably would come up in court, or it could come up in court proceedings. Mr. B URTON . Not unless somebody asked. I mean, your advisory panels over at HHS, nobody ever asked many of those people, theygot a financial disclosure statement and many of those were com-pletely vacant. There wasn 't anything on it until we checked. So an expert witness that 's testifying, it seems to me logical the first question asked is, do you have any financial ties to the com-pany that manufactured the product that created this adverseevent. Seems like you 'd want to ask that, wouldn 't you? Wouldn 't you? Mr. B ALBIER . Quite honestly, it hasn 't come up. Mr. B URTON . I know it, that 's why I 'm bringing it up now. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May Right. I 'll have to look into that and let you know. I honestly don 't know. I 'm not aware that we require that. I don 't think that we do. Mr. B URTON . Well, I will make a suggestion that you do require it. Because anybody that has a bias, pro or con, on a subject likethat, it should be made public. And if they do have a bias, let 's say, in favor of a pharmaceutical company that may have been sued,now they 're not going to be sued because of the compensation fund, but if you have a company that may have a financial interest inthat product, it seems to me logical you 'd want to know that before you made that person an expert witness. Mr. H ARRIS . I would be happy to work with your staff, Mr. Chair- man, if that 's something that you feel strongly about, which appar- ently you do, to see what we can do to do that. From my own view,if I were an expert influenced by a drug company, I think my tend-ency would be to tell the folks to pay out in every case so that Iwouldn 't be sued in State court. Mr. B URTON . Well, I really ought to show you these advisory committee panel financial statements we have. Because what wefound out was that people, and particularly on the Rotashield vac-cine, the chairman of that committee had stock in the committeethat was manufacturing one of those vaccinations. And he stronglysupported it going into the marketplace. You would think that he would have thought twice about that, wouldn 't you? But he didn 't. In 1993, the Institute of Medicine published a report, Adverse Events Associated With Childhood Vaccines. Evidence bearing incausality recommended that research be conducted to answer thefollowing question: Is the age at which the vaccine is given a factorin adverse events experienced? Are some groups of individualsmore predisposed to experiencing such adverse events than others?Are there common denominators among individuals who have re-ported vaccine injuries to VAERS or filed claims through the VICP? What is the extent to which vaccines can trigger disorders through immune reaction? Are there long latency adverse eventsfollowing vaccinations? Long term studies and biologically plausiblelate onset adverse events? Use of newly devised laboratory tools forvirus detection to determine vaccines that have been historicallyaccepted as safe to detect additional viruses? After this report was published in 1993, what actions did your office take in communicating with other HHS agencies such asCDC and NIH to request these research activities take place? Ithink we 'll address that to you, Mr. Balbier. Mr. B ALBIER . Yes, Mr. Burton. We don 't conduct any research, scientific research, in our program or for that matter, really in ouragency. Research is conducted primarily by NIH, CDC, and ofcourse, the licensing of vaccines is the responsibility of FDA. Mr. B URTON . Let me interrupt you here. What I 'm asking is, this report was published, which would have a direct bearing on a deci-sion that might be made regarding an adverse reaction. So it seemsto me these questions would have to be answered in order for youto make an intelligent decision on an adverse reaction. And sowhat I 'm asking is, after this report was published in 1993, did your office take any action to say to these other agencies, HHS, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May NIH, did you say, hey, have you guys done any research in these areas? Because all of these would have a bearing onwhether or not the adverse reaction was as a result of the vaccina-tion. And if you didn 't do that, I want to know why not. Mr. B ALBIER . All right. There has been quite a bit of research done on adverse events related to vaccines. CDC can discuss thatin much better detail than I can. But what I can tell you is whatwe have done. One of those \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Did you request answers to those questions I just gave you? Mr. B ALBIER . Well, in the one instance that affects our program, and that \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . These all affect your program. Mr. B ALBIER . No, I mean \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . All of these questions I just read, every single one of them would have an impact on the decisionmaking process onwhether or not an adverse event was one that should be com-pensated. And if you have not asked these agencies if they havedone these things and what the results of those studies were, thenyou don 't have the answers. Mr. B ALBIER . No, we work very closely with those agencies and we are \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Let me read those to you again. This is important. Is the age at which the vaccine is given a factor in adverse events experienced? I 'm going to give you this so you can take it with you, because I don 't think you have these answers. Are some groups of individuals more predisposed to experiencing such ad-verse events than others? And have they done any checking onthat? Are there common denominators among individuals who havereported vaccine injuries to VAERS or filed claims through theVICP? What is the extent to which vaccines can trigger disorders through immune reaction? Are there long latency adverse eventsfollowing vaccinations? Can it be over a longer period of time? Dothey lay dormant in somebody? We 're talking right now about an- thrax. There 's some question about whether or not there 's a latency period before these anthrax onsets take place. So that 's something we ought to know. Long term studies and biologically plausible late onset adverse events? Use of newly devised laboratory tools for virus detection todetermine vaccines that have been historically accepted as safe todetect whether or not they 're not safe? So I'm going to give you this. Those are things that need to be looked into before a decision is made. I want to say one more thing, and I see all my colleagues are gone, so I 'm the only one left, so I 'm not going to keep you here any longer than necessary. I have one more question I was askedby one of the families that testified. The lawyers for the Justice Department that are taking on a case that's appealed, they 're paid every week, aren 't they? Or do you get paid every month? Mr. H ARRIS . Yes, Mr. Chairman. VerDate Well compensated, or not as well as you could be, but you 're compensated fairly well. How are the lawyers paid that are on the other side of the issue? Are they paid monthly? Mr. H ARRIS . No, Mr. Chairman. They are paid at the end of the resolution of the cases. But the Department, frankly, supports in-terim payments for experts to help ease the costs. Mr. B URTON . That would include the attorneys? Mr. H ARRIS . I think we would be willing to discuss \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . It doesn 't include the attorneys? Mr. H ARRIS . No. Expert witnesses is what I 'm talking about. Mr. B URTON . But the attorney, he 's the one that 's putting all of his time into the case. If the case goes on year after year after year,what does he do? It ends up being pro bono. He just reaches a pointwhere he says, hey, listen, I can 't help you any more. Mr. H ARRIS . I understand. We have to abide by what the statute requires. And the statute requires that we pay them at the end. Mr. B URTON . Maybe we should pay the Justice Department law- yers at the end, too, what do you think? Mr. H ARRIS . Not a good idea. [Laughter.] Mr. B URTON . Not a good idea? Mr. ARRIS . No. Mr. B URTON . You wouldn 't do it, would you? Mr. H ARRIS . I'm not sure it would make much difference, but \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Oh, I 'm sure, if you can 't put food on the table, you wouldn 't do it. Mr. H ARRIS . My wife would probably strongly disagree with that. Mr. B URTON . OK. I will state that the hearing record will remain open until November 15th, so that we can ask additional questions.We'd like you to submit answers to them. Let me just say this to you. We 're going to have you guys back again very soon. I promise you. We 're going to bring some more people up here and we 're going to ask you to sit there and listen to them. And I 'm going to get you a list of the cases that we talked about earlier, as many as I can find, so that maybe you can follow-up and maybe make their lives a little bit easier and make themfeel like this Government is responding as it should to very difficultsituations that they 're involved in. And I have to tell you one more thing. When you 're in the bu- reaucracy and you 're there for a long time, and you 've been there for a long time, Mr. Balbier, you hear, I 'm not so sure that maybe you don 't become a little callous, not intentionally, but I think you do become a little callous, because you hear so many of these hor-ror stories. I mean, we don 't hear that many, so many of us up here, our heart bleeds for these people. But you hear them everyday. So after a while, whether you realize it or not, maybe you become a little callous. Not intentionally. I 'm not saying you 're a callous in- dividual. But there is an appearance of defensiveness and arro-gance that sometimes comes across to people, and they feel notonly that you don 't care, they feel hopeless. And that 's really sad. So I would just say to you, because you 're going to be there for a while, I 'm sure, I can 't do anything about that, I can drag you up here and beat you over the head. But I can 't get you out of that job, in all probability. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May wish you would think of one thing. When you talk to those people, they 're suffering. They 're hurting inside. They 've got a child or a sibling or somebody that 's really suffering. So when you tell them no or you give them, do it with a heart. Do that for me, eventhough you and I may not like each other, you may not like memuch because I 'm such a hard nose. But if you 'll do that, it would be a real favor to me. Because a lot of these people are suffering. We'll have you back here again and you can hear some more of their stories and we 'll get some more questions answered. And I will submit this to you so you can take a look at that. With that, do we have any other questions? If not, thank you for being here. We stand adjourned. [Whereupon, at 2:04 p.m., the committee was adjourned, to re- convene at the call of the Chair.] [The prepared statements of Hon. Constance A. Morella, Hon. Dave Weldon, and aditional information submitted for IT WORKING AS CON-GRESS INTENDED? WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 12, 2001 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC.

First of all, let me apologize for our late start. We had a vote on the floor, and I 'm sure you understand getting all the Members to the floor and back, it 's kind of difficult sometimes. Mr. Waxman, I understand, will be on his way here pretty quickly,but in order to expedite the hearing, we will go ahead and start. Good afternoon. A quorum being present, the Committee on Gov- ernment Reform will come to order, and I ask unanimous consentthat all Members ' and witnesses ' written and opening statements be included in the record. And without objection, so ordered. I ask unanimous consent that all articles, exhibits, and extra- neous or tabular material referred to be included in the record. Andwithout objection, so ordered. Today we are holding our second hearing on the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. I have made it clear that I believe thisprogram has become entirely too adversarial. After our hearing lastmonth, I think that most of the members of the committee cameto the same conclusion. This is a program that 's meant to help fam- ilies that have a serious problem. These families have children whoreceived serious injuries. They need medical care for the rest of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May and these are families that are traumatized. This pro- gram is supposed to help them get the compensation they deserveand they need. It 's supposed to be fast. It 's supposed to be gener- ous. It 's supposed to be nonconfrontational. What we found instead is a program that 's slow and difficult and highly adversarial. Cases get dragged on for years and years andyears. Government lawyers are sometimes very aggressive. Lastmonth we had three witnesses testify. Two of them were parentsof vaccine-injured children. One was the husband of a woman whowas injured by a tetanus vaccine. They were each tied up in thesystem for over 8 years. The government had spent 8 years tryingto prove that the vaccine did not cause the injury. The Governmentlost each of those cases. Those three people told us about the hard-ships their families had to endure as they went through this proc-ess. They told us about the tens of thousands of dollars they hadto spend out of their own pockets while they waited for the casesto be resolved. They told us about how disillusioned they were withour government. Then we heard from the Justice Department and HHS. There was some suggestion from our government witnesses that thesewere isolated cases. I have a problem with that for two reasons.First, I don 't think it 's true, and second, I don 't think these are iso- lated cases. But, that 's beside the point. We 're not talking about statistics. These are people. They have serious problems. The responses we got at our last hearing were not reassuring in the least. When Dr. Weldon asked Mr. Balbier if someone couldjust pick up the phone and call Ms. Zuhlke, who struggled throughthis program for 10 years after her daughter was injured by a vac-cine, Mr. Balbier apparently had a problem with that. That 's not reassuring. So I said, fine, we 'll meet again in a couple of weeks. We'll bring in three more families. We will see if we can 't convince you that these aren 't isolated cases. They are real people who de- serve to be treated with dignity, and that 's what brings us here today. I intend fully to have a whole series of hearings for next year on a regular basis, and I ask the same people from HHS and Justiceto come in to listen to these horror stories until we get some an-swers that are positive. Today we are going to be hearing from Lori Barton of Albuquer- que, NM; we are going to hear from Tara Dyer of Knoxville, TN;and we are going to hear from Joseph Holder of Denville, NJ. AndI want to thank each of one of them for being here today to tellus about their stories and their problems. At my last hearing in my opening statement, I highlighted the case of Janet Zuhlke because I thought it really explained our frus-trations with the program. Janet 's daughter was injured by a vac- cine in 1990. She is now permanently disabled. She is mentally re-tarded. She suffers from periodic bouts of blindness. At times sheis confined to a wheelchair. It took Janet 10 years to win com-pensation for her daughter because the government tried to proveit was caused by a strep infection. The government still lost. Shestill has not received the money she is entitled to because there aremore hoops to jump through, and it 's now going on 11 years, and that's just wrong. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May want to again highlight one of the cases that are before us. All three deserve to be highlighted, but in the interest of time,I'm going to focus for now on the Barton case because I find it so troubling, and I hope my colleagues from government, the JusticeDepartment and HHS, will listen to this. Lori Barton 's son Dustin received his third DTP shot in 1989. He began to have seizures. His body became rigid. He stopped lookingat things. He became legally blind. In the words of Lori Barton, hewas a different child. He was eventually diagnosed with residualseizure disease, disorder. In 1991, the Bartons filed a petition forcompensation, 11 years ago. Now, I should acknowledge from the outset that this was not an open and shut case. It was complicated by the fact that Dustin wasborn with a condition known as PVL that causes lesions on thebrain. However, that does not excuse the way the Justice Depart-ment handled this case. They had their first hearing in 1993. LoriBarton and her mother testified. They were subjected to severecross examination by the Justice Department lawyer. The lawyertried to pick apart their statements like a hard-nosed litigator. LoriBarton felt like she was being treated like a criminal. The specialmaster overseeing the case called it overkill. Despite that, the Bar-tons won round one. After it took 4 years for them to get to thesecond round, the next hearing, 4 more years. That was in August 1997. Three months later Dustin had a mas- sive seizure, and he died. What started out as an injury caseturned into a death case because it dragged out so long. In 1999,8 years after the Bartons filed their petition, and 2 years afterDustin died, the special master awarded them compensation. But there was one final indignity, and I want you to get this. The Justice Department told the Bartons that they didn 't agree with the decision, and they didn 't want it to be published. They were paying them, but they didn 't want anybody to know about it. They didn't want it published. They didn 't want it to become a precedent that might help other families, and if they didn 't get this agree- ment that it wouldn 't be published, they might appeal the decision and delay the compensation for another year or two. That in theprivate sector would be called blackmail, but the Justice Depart-ment was saying, we 're not going to give you your money even though you have gone through this and your son died, even thoughit has taken 8 or 9 years, but we will give you the money if youdon't publish this; but if you don 't, we 're going to appeal the case. Those are the kind of blackjack tactics that the American people just get sick about, but it happens in our government. And rightnow we 've got our troops fighting overseas for our freedoms and this Republic that we enjoy, and we have government officials beat-ing people over the head like that. That 's not right. Well, the Bartons had been worn down over 8 years. They had lost their son. Lori 's health was not good, so they agreed, and who can blame them. What did Lori have wrong with her? She hadlupus. All the time she was going through this, she was sufferingfrom lupus, and so she was dead tired, and she finally said OK. That 's not how Congress intended for this program to work, and these are not isolated cases. At our last hearing I said that we hadsome clear evidence of overzealous conduct by the government. In VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May of the Sword family, the special master called the Justice Department lawyer 's tactics egregious. In the Marks case the spe- cial master called the government 's tactics abrasive, tenacious, and obstreperous. In the Barton case we are seeing the same thing again. I have the transcript of the 1993 hearing. That 's the hearing where the Justice Department lawyer was so brutal in her cross examination.I want to read to everyone what the special master said about theJustice Department lawyer representing the government. This iswhat the special master said, ''In my opinion, counsel for the re- spondent has unfortunately mischaracterized much of the testi-mony and much of the evidence in this case, which leaves the courtto tend to discount some of her closing arguments because, frankly,they are of the characterization that tends to misconstrue facts ina way that gives lawyers a bad name. '' They 're talking about the Justice Department. They were giving the lawyers a bad name because of the way they were handling thecase. He went on, ''Frankly, I believe counsel has been inaccurate and has jumped to conclusions that are not supported by the recordand, in such a way, does somewhat of a disservice to the court. '' These are our government lawyers.Now, that 's not how Congress meant this program to work. Each time we see those comments from a special master, it gets harderand harder to believe that they 're isolated incidents. I want to wrap up without taking too much more time, but there are a couple final points I want to make. The Zuhlke case involvedencephalopathy. The Barton case involved a residual seizure dis-order. These are conditions that everyone agrees are related to vac-cines. They were listed in the table of injuries that Congress cre-ated. These are supposed to be easy cases; yet they took 8 yearsor more to decide, and they caused a lot of heartaches for thosefamilies. We have very few table cases being filed today, and this is due in part to the new DTaP vaccine, but it also is due in large partto the changes to the table of injuries. Almost half of the injuriesthat the program compensated were for injuries that were removedfrom the table of injuries by HHS. The cases being filed today aremuch more difficult. Today 's cases involve complications related to the tetanus shot and the hepatitis B vaccine. They involve Thimer-osal, which contains mercury, and autism and speech and planningdelays. These are very difficult questions, and scientific research iswoefully inadequate. If the system we put in place couldn 't handle the easy cases, how on Earth is the system going to handle thesehard new cases? One thing that 's for sure is that we need more research on vac- cine safety, and we can 't wait. In the case of autism we used to have 1 in 10,000 children that were inflicted with autism. Nowthroughout the country it 's 1 in 500. In some parts of the country it's 1 in 200 or less. We have an absolute epidemic, and we need to get on with finding out the reasons why. We can 't wait, and the Federal Government needs to take the lead to make sure it 's done. I also want to point out that I am very concerned about this busi- ness of the government pressuring families not to have the deci- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 don 't know if Mr. Waxman was here when we were talking about this, but we had a case decided because the gov-ernment said they would go ahead and pay the person after thechild had died, after 10 years of litigation, if they wouldn 't publish it because they didn 't want to set a precedent, and they literally were beating them over the head, and the woman who was themother had lupus, and she agreed because she was simply worndown, and she is going to testify today. We're waiting for that information from the Justice Department that we have talked about, but the reason for it is very clear. Thegovernment doesn 't want other families to benefit from those prece- dents when the government loses while the government is sup-posed to be helping these families, not putting obstacles in theirpath, and when we get to our second panel I 'm going to have some very pointed questions about that. My final point is this. At our last hearing we heard some graphic testimony about injuries that were caused by vaccines. We 're going to hear the same kind of testimony today, and it 's important that we hear these stories, but we don 't want to scare people into not having their kids vaccinated. Vaccines save lives, and vaccines in-juries are rare. We would like them to be even more rare, andthat's why I 'm so serious about pushing for more research. We also want this: When a family has a child who has been in- jured by a vaccine, we want them to get the compensation they de-serve and not have to wait 10 or 12 years until the child dies andto be beaten over the head by the Justice Department and the peo-ple who are supposed to be protecting our liberties. We want themto be treated with dignity and respect. We owe that to the Zuhlkes,and the Bartons, and the Dyers and the Holders. We owe it to allthe other families who suffer from this kind of a crisis. I 'm not say- ing that the Justice Department has handled every case badly, butI want what I 'm sure the Attorney General wants, and that is for every case to be handled with a little compassion. I want to thank our witnesses for being here today, and I look forward to all their testimony, and I 'm planning to introduce legis- lation to try to fix these problems and, hopefully CongressmanWaxman and I can work together to get that problem solved. AndI look forward to working with Dr. Weldon, who will be here short-ly, who 's working on this, and with Mr. Waxman and others. The hearing record will remain until December 27, and I now yield to Mr. Waxman. [The prepared statement of Hon. Dan Burton follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for raising these points. There are few strategic resources more important toour Nation 's health than a reliable and safe supply of vaccines. By preventing illness, vaccines reduce the spread of disease and elimi-nate the need of costly and potentially dangerous treatments. It isindisputable that immunizations have saved tens of thousands oflives in our country and millions more around the world. Fifteen years ago the supply of vaccines in the United States was vulnerable. At that time pharmaceutical companies were threaten-ing to leave the business of manufacturing childhood vaccines, cit-ing among other things litigation costs as their reason for leaving.The United States was facing the very real possibility that wewould experience a resurgence of such devastating illnesses aspolio and measles, a disease that killed 450 Americans in each yearof my childhood. In response to this potential public health crisis,Congress created the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in1987. The purpose of the program was threefold: first, to be a no-fault program to compensate people who suffer from the rare, but some-times serious side effects of vaccines; second, to lower the numberof lawsuits against vaccine companies in order to encourage themto stay in the vaccine business and thus to ensure a healthy domes-tic supply of vaccines; and, third, to allay parents ' concerns about vaccine safety so that parents continue to have their children vac-cinated. Now nearly 15 years later it is again time to pay attention to the vaccine supply. The good news is that immunization rates are high,and we rarely see outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases likepolio or measles. While some vaccine manufacturers have left thevaccine business, they cannot cite liability as a reason for leaving.People seem generally satisfied with the awards they get under theVaccine Injury Compensation Program. The act Congress passedallowed people to reject their awards and sue the vaccine manufac-turers. Once they have gone through the program, very few peti-tioners have followed this route. However, there are also causes for concern. Several weeks ago the Federal Government reported shortages of vaccine to protectagainst the devastating disease of diptheria, tetanus, whoopingcough and certain common forms of severe pneumonia and men-ingitis. In addition, serious delays have been noted in delivery ofvaccines against influenza, chickenpox, measles, mumps, rubella,and hepatitis B. These vaccine problems are not due to concernsabout litigation. Nonetheless, the lives of thousands of Americanchildren and adults are in jeopardy. Congress must be prepared to act in order to shore up the vac- cine supply. I expect that the House of Representatives will soonpass a bill to combat bioterrorism. This legislation authorizes mil-lions of dollars for the stockpiling of a vaccine against smallpox.Such an effort is essential, but it is important to keep in mind onekey fact. Smallpox will only threaten American lives if an evil ter-rorist uses the virus to attack us. For many other infectious dis-eases, no terrorist needs to lift a finger for the health of our chil-dren to be threatened. Simple neglect of our vaccine supply willcause epidemics and claim lives around the country. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 focus on the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. It needs to be as fair and efficient as possible. Today we will hearabout the problems with the program and discuss possible solu-tions, and I 'm pleased that we will hear today from families with direct experience with this system. I'm also pleased we will be hearing today from the administra- tion. The administration has expressed support for certain changesin the program, including increasing the statute of limitations andallowing for interim payments to petitioners ' attorneys for their costs. These will be important steps in easing the burden of par-ents that get compensation for vaccine injuries, and I look forwardto working with the administration on these changes. I want to comment on the point that Mr. Burton made a minute or two ago about the fact that after some settlements, people weretold not to discuss their complaint. I don 't know the facts of the case he cited, but I do know that there are many, many lawsuitsfor tort that are settled with the demand by the defendant that inexchange for the settlement, that all the facts be kept quiet. I thinkthat's wrong. I don 't think facts ought to be kept quiet. I don 't think they ought to be under seal. After all, to keep facts from get-ting out means that other people won 't have the benefit of the in- formation that could prevent the same thing happening over andover again to others. Litigation may be a lawsuit between privateparties, but there is a broader public interest, and we shouldn 't allow the records to be sealed and information withheld when thatinformation can benefit other people. I thank Chairman Burton for focusing attention on the need for a fair and efficient vaccine compensation system. I thank the wit-nesses for appearing today, and I look forward to their testimony. Mr. G ILMAN [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Waxman. [The prepared statement of Hon. Henry A. Waxman follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 M ORELLA . Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I am pleased that Chairman Burton is holding this hearing to continue to examine inmore detail the effectiveness of the National Vaccine Injury Com-pensation Program. I welcome the witnesses today. I appreciatetheir coming and look forward to hearing their testimony. I alsolook forward to learning more about this program and its responseand its service to our citizens. I believe that our Nation 's vaccine program is first and foremost about the protection of our citizens and their health. Today manymore Americans are looking at vaccines as a major accessoryagainst the threat of bioterrorism. We as a Nation need to have inplace a vaccine program that all Americans can trust. We need tohave confidence in all aspects of all vaccine programs. We need tobe confident in the production of vaccines and need to ensure thatthose who deserve to be compensated for injuries suffered from thevaccines are compensated in a fair and just manner. As a member of this committee, I want to ensure that all vaccine programs operate in a manner that Congress intended, so it is withthis objective in mind that I look forward to the testimony of thewitnesses, and, Mr. Chairman, I thank you. I yield back whatevertime was allotted me. Mr. G ILMAN . Thank you, Mrs. Morella. [The prepared Constance A. UMMINGS . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Vaccinating children against infectious diseases has been one of the most effective public health initiatives ever undertaken in theUnited States. Vast nations have reduced vaccine-preventable dis-eases by more than 95 percent. Unfortunately vaccination programs carry a human cost. The U.S. Government acknowledges that a vaccine can have severe sideeffects, including death or disabling conditions requiring lifetimemedical care. Other conditions that may be associated with vac-cines include autism, neurological injuries, seizures, and a numberof autoimmune disorders. These reactions can be devastating to aneffective family. As a result, in 1986, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act established a Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to compensateindividuals or families of individuals who had been injured bychildhood vaccines whether administered in the private or publicsector. Over the years I believe the Vaccine Injury CompensationProgram has achieved its policy goals of providing compensation tothose injured by rare adverse events, liability protection for vaccinemanufacturers and administrators, and vaccine market stabiliza-tion. It has succeeded in providing a less adversarial, expensiveand time-consuming system of recovery than the traditional tortsystem that governs medical malpractice, personal injury and prod-uct liability cases. More than 1,500 people had been paid in excessof $1.18 billion since the inception of the program in 1988. However, there are certain aspects of the program that should be reviewed regularly. For example, to reserve the integrity of the pro-gram, it is essential to continue relying on scientific evidence whenmaking additions or changes to the table listing the conditions thatcan be compensated through the program. Science-based changesor additions including new vaccines should be made promptly. Much of the ongoing research as well as the development and ap- propriate supply of vaccines are benefits of the program. Before theprogram was in place, many vaccine manufacturers stopped pro-ducing certain vaccines due to potential liability issues. As a result,vaccine supplies dwindled, endangering the health and safety ofthe Nation 's children. The program, the only Federal no-fault sys- tem, has made it possible to continue vaccine production and re-search in order to improve existing vaccines and develop new ones.Vaccine safety research must continue to be a top priority, includ-ing working to eliminate adverse reactions. I want to thank the witnesses for being with us today, and I look forward to hearing their testimony. I yield back. Mr. G ILMAN . Thank you, Mr. Cummings. [The prepared Elijah E. Mr. D UNCAN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and first I want to thank Chairman Burton for his calling this hearing today and forhis heartfelt concern about this issue. At our last hearing a fewweeks ago on this same subject, I told about a woman who hadcome to see me, a constituent today, in Lenoir City, TN, who toldme that she had taken her perfectly healthy small son to get a DPTshot and the severe horrible reactions that he had following thatshot and the fact that he was now 2 years old and weighed 22pounds and had continual seizures all day and all night long, pro-jectile vomiting, and all sorts of horrible things. And then later I met one of my constituents, Mrs. Tara Dyer, who I also mentioned at the last hearing, and I 'm pleased that Mrs. Dyer and her family are here today. She is here with her husbandand her three children, Kaylee, Kelsee and Andy. Mrs. Dyer is heretoday to share with the committee the story of her son Andy, wholed a perfectly normal life up until the time he received his firstDPT shot. Shortly after receiving this routine vaccination, Mrs.Dyer began to notice changes in Andy 's physical and emotional be- havior, which she will discuss in depth today. Like so many of the witnesses we have before us on this, the Dyers are frustrated with the current National Vaccine InjuryCompensation Program. After filing for compensation in 1995, theDyers had to wait until 1999 to find out they had been denied com-pensation under this program. To me as well as many people,Andy 's case was and is one that should have been a clear case for compensation. Andy 's vaccine came from a batch that was associ- ated with 78 adverse events and 3 deaths; 44 of those events camesolely from the State of Tennessee. I share the frustration felt by the Dyer family. The National Vac- cine Injury Compensation Program has become nothing more thananother giant government bureaucracy that is not operating in thespirit in which Congress envisioned. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you for conducting this hearing, and I think it 's a very important topic, and I hope that we can lead to improvements because it is such a sad thing, as Isaid at the previous hearing, when parents take their children forsomething that they think is an absolutely wonderful thing forthem to do for their health and then have the kinds of things hap-pen that we heard about at our last hearing and we will hear aboutfrom our witnesses today. And I also want to welcome my constituent Mrs. Dyer to our hearing today. Thank you very much. Mr. G ILMAN . Thank you, Mr. Duncan. We look forward to hear- ing Ms. Dyer 's testimony. [The prepared statement of Hon. John Duncan follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 T IERNEY . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you and I want to thank Chairman Burton for having this hearingtoday. I understand the Federal Government sets up systems, ourjudicial system, obviously, to the Constitution and this system withthe best intentions. The intentions are to solve and resolve issuesand problems that our population has. We don 't always get it right, and I share the frustration of many people here that this particularsystem that was set up had all of the best intentions and has re-solved for a lot of people some of the issues, but as for some, obvi-ously, appears to be missing the mark. The testimony we heard in our previous hearing on this subject was moving and was also troubling. In each of the cases the wit-nesses described how they waited for years for compensation whilethe Justice Department seemed to be obstructing their efforts, andfor this reason I 'm glad that we 're going to have the opportunity to hear again some more of the possible changes that are needed. The program, the compensation program, was created to provide assistance to individuals. Last month we learned that this is notquite the less than adversarial system that we hoped it would be,and it is looking more like the traditional tort system that is cum-bersome, it is long in process, it is very adversarial. When the committee first reported out this particular piece of legislation, it indicated that it chose to provide compensation to allpersons whose injuries meet the requirements of the petition in thetable and whose injuries cannot be demonstrated to be caused byother factors. But the testimony that we 've heard recently and the testimony we are going to receive again today seem to indicatequite clearly that the Department of Justice does not always seemto have followed the committee 's intent. We heard from families of several individuals who described years of what they believed wasstonewalling. It was followed by subsequent appeals by the Depart-ment of Justice. For those families it took an unacceptably longamount of time to be compensated. I think the testimony of our witnesses today may surely be fur- ther evidence that the individuals we heard from last month werenot merely telling us about anecdotal evidence, but something thatis real. The Department continues to claim that these cases are notrepresentative about the manner in which they treat most vaccineinjury compensation cases, but the data that was provided by theDepartment shows that the majority of cases that have been ap-pealed for which the initial decision favored the petitioner also hadthe appeal resulting in favor of the petitioner. That strongly sup-ports that the claims we heard last month indicating that the De-partment of Justice is being overly and perhaps wrongly adversar-ial. There are a number of other improvements that are needed in this compensation program, and I think I look forward to examin-ing all of them. I 'm pleased that there seems to be some areas of consensus among members of the committee on both sides, includ-ing support for the payment of interim fees to attorneys workingon behalf of claimants. I think we should be able to find a way tomake that change quickly to begin to properly defray the families ' obligation to their counsel while they are pursuing these matters. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May may not, Mr. Chairman, be able to stay for all of the tes- timony, it will be taken down and will be available for us to read. I think, as I said earlier, it is important for this committee to hear the circumstances. I regret that these families have had tolive under these circumstances and just pledge that this committeewill work together to try to resolve this so that others will at leastbenefit from your experience. Thank you. Mr. G ILMAN . Thank you, Mr. Tierney. Mr. Horn. Thank you, Mr. Horn.I would like to welcome the panelists and thank Chairman Bur- ton for holding this hearing today. We look forward to hearing fromthe witnesses as our committee continues to examine the effective-ness of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. In1986, when Congress passed legislation introduced by the rankingminority member, Mr. Waxman, it intended to provide fair com-pensation to individuals harmed by vaccines while ensuring thatthe vaccine manufacturers would continue to supply and createsafe vaccines for the American public. Instead the program has be-come bogged down in litigation in cases lasting years, facing nu-merous levels of appeals before any final decisions are made. During my years in the Congress, I have been contacted by many families, all of whom experience varying levels of difficulty withtheir claims before the compensation program ranging from beingforced into long, drawn-out court battles to outright denial ofclaims due to changes in definitions and criteria. One such example is Tommy Sansone, Jr. Tommy 's family has been trying to receive compensation for the lingering devastatingeffects of a DPT vaccine he received when he was just 6 monthsold. His family tried to file a claim immediately after their son de-veloped a severe chronic seizure disorder less than 2 weeks afterreceiving the vaccine. Regrettably they were told that before aclaim could be filed, the family needed to spend more than $1,000in nonreimbursable vaccine-related expenses before they can filesuch a claim, and since Tommy was covered by his father 's insur- ance plan, it took several months before the Sansones met thatmonetary requirement. By that time, however, the criteria for theDPT vaccine had been changed, eliminating seizures from the tableof related side effects. For 10 years a large percentage of those withbrain damage and other symptoms were recognized to be DPT inju-ries, but by 1995, the year in which Tommy 's claim was made, it was no longer recognized. Those new definitions have had unin-tended consequences, using criteria that is so strict that the res-titution fund pays fewer claims than before despite the fact thatthere 's over $1.7 billion in that fund today. As a result, the families of children like Tommy find it virtually impossible to win a claimagainst a vaccine injury compensation program. That was over 6years ago and thousands of dollars in medical expenses later. Congress envisioned that the program would be a simple one, would be straightforward and more streamlined than typical litiga- tion. Somehow congressional intent was lost along the way. Tommyfaces a lifetime of crippling seizures and mounting medical bills inaddition to the emotional strain on him and his family. Hopefullythese hearings will lead to a necessary adjustment to the program VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May finally help children like Tommy receive the kind of com- pensation to which they are entitled.

STATEMENTS OF LORI BARTON, ALBUQUERQUE, NM; TARA DYER, KNOXVILLE, TN; JOE HOLDER, BAYONNE, NJ;CLIFFORD SHOEMAKER, LLP, ARLINGTON, VA; AND ROBERT BLOCK, M.D., CHAIRMAN, ADVISORY COMMISSION ON CHILD-HOOD VACCINATIONS, TULSA, OK Ms. B ARTON . My name is Lori Barton, and I 'm here speaking on behalf of my son Dustin. Dusty was born on July 14, 1988, slightlypremature, apparently normal, with Apgar scores of 8 and 8. Heand I went home after 3 days. He developed normally, lifting hishead, recognizing favorite items, learning to rock, roll from stom-ach to back and finally at 5 months starting to rock on his handsand knees as babies do before they begin to crawl. He had his DPT shots as scheduled at 2, 4 and 6 months, Sep- tember 15, 1988; November 16, 1988; and January 18, 1989. Afterhis first DPT vaccination, he cried for 24 hours straight until hewould exhaust himself to sleep for a few minutes at a time. Beforethe second DPT I asked the doctor, Dr. Marek, who was our familydoctor, about this reaction to his first vaccine. He said it was a nor-mal reaction and, ''He's fine now. '' Besides, is it was, ''the law that required the vaccines, '' which I found out later was not exactly true. So we gave him the second DPT. This time was much worse. His continuous screaming lasted for at least 2 days, with weeks ofintermittent bouts of screaming. He had begun to roll over fromstomach to back and could no longer do this. The doctor said thescreaming was colic, and that it was probably a fluke that he hadrolled over and would do it again real soon. My mother baby-sat Dustin while I worked and was going to take Dusty for his third DPT shot. She and I talked about both ourreservations regarding this shot, and she was going to ask if it wasabsolutely necessary he receive it. I told her she could ask, but Itrusted this doctor and said if he said he needed the shot, then wewould have to go ahead and give it to him. This was January 18,1989. That night Dustin began to exhibit what I then called shivers. I called my mom, and she told me to phone the doctor. Dustin wasjust stiff. The doctor told me that Dusty probably had a low-grade VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 had developed a habit out of these shivers. This time, though, there was no crying, and Dustin was unusually quiet.From 24 hours after the third DPT shot until 11 months of agewhen he began physical therapy, he was virtually without move-ment except during his shivers, which I later found out were sei-zures. We finally started taking Dustin to other doctors. We took him to a pediatric ophthalmologist because he was no longer looking di-rectly at us, who told us Dusty was legally blind. He went fromseeing and laughing at fans on the ceiling to barely seeing brightlycolored objects right in front of him. Our initial doctor, Dr. Marek, testified against us at the first evi- dentiary hearing. The special master found him to have, ''selective memory. '' She also asked him if he wrote everything in his medical records. He said only if he deemed them medically necessary. Thespecial master then asked him if he would write down the wordsof a hysterical mother or grandmother, which is what he had calledus. His answer was no. I accidentally found out about the compensation system and the VAERS. I was in a support group for parents of disabled children,and one of them showed me some information on a group calledDPT, Dissatisfied Parents Together, which I joined. They sent mea law firm directory, and from there I picked a lawyer and wrotehim a letter. This case was filed on November 15, 1991. Elizabeth Kroop, the Department of Justice attorney, was assigned this case for the re-spondent. The first evidentiary hearing was held 2 years later onSeptember 28 and 29, 1993. At that time the Justice Departmentattorney treated me and my witnesses, my mother and two friends,as if she were prosecuting a criminal trial and we were the crimi-nals. She was rude and actually cruel to my mother, insinuatingthat she was not a good caretaker of Dustin. At one point she al-most had my mother in tears, and in walked our old doctor, Dr.Marek, who had to testify right then. So my mother had an over-night reprieve. All I could tell her was to not let the Justice De-partment attorney get to her. We didn 't do anything wrong. The next day my mom did much better. At the end of the hearing, thespecial master berated Ms. Kroop for her treatment of us, as youheard in Chairman Burton 's opening statement. It was found at that hearing that Dustin did have a table time injury from his third DPT shot, and he had a resulting seizure dis-order from this injury. After agonizing delays, I even commented to family and friends that the government was waiting for Dustin to die so they wouldonly have to pay a death benefit. The second hearing finally occurred on August 7, 1997. This was the hearing of the expert witnesses. Again during this hearing theJustice Department attorney was very abusive toward me and evencalled me a liar because she asked when Dustin became a patientof his current neurologist. I gave her the date that we actually be-came \u2014began a doctor/patient relationship with him. She brought out this paper and showed the date was earlier than I had said.I had taken Dustin to this neurologist about a year before for a sec-ond opinion and had forgotten about that. Through the rest of the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May would comment on my credibility because of that one incident. Closing arguments were to be scheduled for a later date, but on Friday, October 24, at about 9 p.m., my husband and I put Dustinto bed. Before going to bed myself, I checked on all three of ourboys. Dusty was sound asleep on top of his blankets, which iswhere I had put him earlier. I covered him with his blankets andleft the room. He was sleeping soundly, snoring a little, as usual,and breathing fine. It was about 12:15 a.m., October 25, 1997. Early on October 25, Dillon, my 5-year-old, woke me to fix break- fast. I got up, dressed, and fixed cereal for Dillon and Shane, my10-year-old. I began to fix Dusty 's breakfast because he normally was awake by this time, and even if he wasn 't, he would awaken while we were fixing his breakfast. When I didn 't hear him, I went to his room. The time was approximately 6:25 a.m. The first thingI noticed was that his blankets were all wrapped around his legs.This was very unusual as he didn 't normally move much in his sleep, especially his legs. He did not have much muscle control orstrength in his legs. He was facing away from the door, so I wentaround to the other side of the room and squatted down beside himto wake him. When I touched Dustin 's face, it was cold. I ran into my bedroom to grab the cordless phone, screaming for Kevin to get up. I dialed the speed dial number for my mother andsaid, come over, I have to call 911. I hung up and dialed 911 asKevin began to give Dustin CPR. I gave directions to the emer-gency service and then took over the CPR. Within 5 minutes theparamedics arrived. My mother and father were there 2 minuteslater. We were at the hospital by 6:50 a.m., and Dustin was pro-nounced dead 10 minutes later. The staff at the hospital believedhe had died about 3 hours earlier. The ER doctor said that she be-lieved Dustin to have died of a seizure and that an autopsy wasn 't necessary, although Dustin 's pediatrician felt that we should have one done as she had not seen Dustin since January or February ofthat year because he had been so healthy. Before he died, Dustin was making great progress. He could walk short distances with his walker, crawl wherever he wanted to go,and speak well enough for family and friends to understand. After receiving the death certificate showing the cause of death as seizures, I filed a motion to recaption and convert the case toa death claim. About this time I also heard from Dustin 's neurologist and the pathologist who did the autopsy saying that the Justice Depart-ment attorney did her best to intimidate them as well. This wasJanuary 1998. At this time a new Justice Department attorney,Mike Milmoe, was assigned Dustin 's case. Dustin 's attorney, Bob Moxley, informed Mr. Milmoe that I had been diagnosed withcerebritis as a result of my lupus, and the doctors told me I hadlittle time left to live. After Mr. Milmoe was granted many moredelays, the final arguments were heard. Special Master French filed her published decision on May 2, 2000. The respondent fileda motion to reconsider, which was granted. The final decision wasfiled June 1, 2000. This final decision was again in our, the peti-tioners ', favor, only it came with a condition. The respondent prom- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 file another appeal in this case if we agreed the decision be unpublished. I agonized over this decision as that meant no other family would be able to cite this case in any of their proceedings, but in the endmy fatigue won out. I was mentally and physically exhausted andwas also quite ill. I didn 't think I could make it through another 10 years of appeals and motions. Luckily my lupus has gone intoremission and is no longer a major threat to my life. I also didn 't want Dustin 's lawyer, Bob Moxley, to go through an- other 10 years of working on our case without getting paid, and Ihad already borrowed thousands of dollars in expert witness andattorney expenses from Dustin 's grandparents. I felt after 10 years of work, his attorney deserved to be paid as well as all four ofDustin 's grandparents. I believe the attorneys should be paid in increments after it is proven that the case is not fraudulent. I also believe that familieswhose cases drag on for years should receive moneys for thoseyears their cases were in the system. Even if the child should dieduring the process, the family has been fighting with the govern-ment to get help for their child while doing it all along. I also believe there should be a limited number of extensions and delays granted to each party. I believe that doctors should be welleducated on what to look for in vaccine adverse reactions. I 'm sure Mr. Milmoe 's tactic of published versus unpublished must be legal, but to me it was extortion. I initially filed this claim so if any money were ever to come of it, it would help Dusty when he needed it, but that never hap-pened. It took almost 10 years to settle this, and Dustin died in theprocess. It seems to me the government got what it was waitingfor, a death benefit. I often wonder if the case had not dragged on for so many years, if Dustin 's outcome would have been different. He would have had the money to seek treatment and therapies outside of Albuquerquethat his insurance would not cover. Maybe one of those could havesaved his life. Mr. B URTON [presiding]. Thank you, Ms. Barton. [The prepared statement of Ms. Barton follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 I had read your story before, so I apologize for not being here at the beginning of your testimony, but I want you toknow we are very sympathetic to the problem you had, and yoursis another story that we shouldn 't have to hear. We just shouldn 't have to hear. Ms. Dyer.Ms. D YER. Good afternoon. My name is Tara Dyer. I 'm the moth- er of three, Kaylee, who is 14; Kelsee, who is 12; and Andy, whois 9. I 'm here on behalf of my son Andy, who at 2 months of age suffered brain damage as the result of a required vaccination. Andy was a perfectly healthy baby at birth with Apgars at 9 and 10 respectfully. The first 2 months of his life were uneventful. Hewould respond happily to his surroundings, laughing and gigglingwhen spoken to, tracking with his eyes, kicking with his arms andlegs when recognizing familiar faces, and he had a very hearty ap-petite. On August 28, 1992, I took Andy in for his first DPT vaccine. As I did with his sisters previously, I gave him Tylenol beforehand tohelp with any fever that might incur. After his first shot, he beganto show symptoms that were unknown to me to be associated withvaccines. The first thing that I remember that was different withAndy 's shot was that he cried much louder and longer than did his sisters. By the time the nurse came to tell us we could leave, hehad virtually cried himself to sleep. He slept all the way home andapproximately 3 hours thereafter. He completely missed a feeding,and I was sure that when he awoke, he would be starved. However,upon awakening, he seemed to have difficulty sucking, and my as-sumption was that he was still sleepy. We were told that beingsleepy after the vaccination is normal. Andy continued to run a mild temperature, sleep more than usual, and not eat as he normally did. After about 48 hours, his fever broke. Yet he seemed more quiet and much more lethargic than before. On September 2nd, I took Andy to his pediatrician for a sched- uled well baby visit. The doctor felt Andy was all right. During September 3rd through the 14th, Andy developed symp- toms which to me appeared to be cold related. He appeared to behaving difficulty breathing, as if he had a stuffy nose. He was noteating well, and this I associated with having the difficulty breath-ing. Then we noticed Andy flicking his ear occasionally. At first we thought that he was just playing with his ear. Then we noticedthat he was doing this cuffing and flicking several times a day. At this time I believed that Andy had possibly developed an ear infection. I took Andy to the doctor again and told him the thingsAndy was doing. The doctor diagnosed him with an upper res-piratory infection. He was put on antibiotics and Dimetapp. Within days the flicking of the ear episodes turned into a com- plete stiffening of the body along with the flicking of the ear. Wevideotaped this and took it to the doctor. He was then diagnosedwith a seizure disorder. It is now known that the difficulty breath-ing, not wanting to suck and the cupping and flicking of his earwere all effects of neurological damage taking place, not an upperrespiratory infection. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 next 2 years, we were seen by several specialists to try and find out why Andy was having these uncontrollable sei-zures. There was no history of seizures in our family. During thistime, his seizures continued, as did his delayed development. Neverduring these 2 years was there a mention that there could be a re-lationship between his shot and the brain injury. Shortly after Andy 's second birthday, a friend mentioned that she had seen a show on vaccines and children with seizures andother disorders. This is when I began to research Andy 's vaccine. The first vaccine Andy received was Lederle 322914. I found that there was a suspicious clustering of events with this vaccine. Thislot contained 78 events with 3 deaths; 44 of the 78 were from Ten-nessee, as were the deaths. All of these occurred between February1992 and June 1993. It is known that vaccine lots manufacturedby Lederle, which have the same first three digits, are all from thesame bulk of vaccine. Therefore, his lot contained a reported \u2014 again, I just say reported \u2014total of 246 events and a total of 12 deaths. This is substantial evidence that my son received a badbatch of vaccine. Why after so many deaths and events was this still being given to our children? Because the FDA says there is no trigger numberfor a recall. The lot distribution number, including the number ofdoses per lot, is confidential. Can you believe this? The lot distribu-tion number is confidential? To this day, we still do not know howmany doses and how many adverse events occurred. At the age of 3 12, Andy was diagnosed as having a seizure dis- order and being severely developmentally delayed. He could walk,but communication was very limited. At this time, he developedliver failure due to the anticonvulsant he was taking. He was ina coma for 8 weeks, and when he came out, he had lost all neuro-logical function, except for the ability to breathe on his own. We were told that he would never walk, talk, or eat orally again. We were told that he was blind and that he was deaf as well, allof this stemming from a required DPT vaccination. My experience with the Vaccine Compensation Injury Program was not a pleasant one. First of all, I believe this program was in-tended to be generous, user-friendly, fair and expedient. It fails inall of these areas. We filed for compensation in July 1995. We were denied com- pensation in August 1999. Going into the hearing after being as-signed Special Magistrate Millman, we felt prejudiced against be-fore ever even starting. She is quoted as saying in the WashingtonPost, ''when I have to refuse an award, it is hard, but I know thesechildren's basic needs are going to be taken care of either way. Itis not like the ancient days when they just threw you off a cliff.'' How dare this government official imply that it won't bother her not to grant an award for a vaccine injury, we should be happy ourchild is just not being disposed of? And, as far as basic needs, thesechildren need much more than food, clothing and shelter. There isthe therapies, medications, special equipment. There is wheelchairlifts, ramps, adapted bathrooms and beds. The list goes on. As my husband and I get older, we worry as to what will happen when physically or mentally we can no longer care for Andy. Aswith our healthy children, we want these injured children to live VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May best circumstances possible and be the best and most that they can be. We hear daily of awards being given to cancer victims or their families because of cigarette smoking. These are people who madethe decision to smoke, even though they were misled as to the dan-gers of tobacco, but these same people are justifiably compensatedfor their injuries. Why can 't our children be compensated for injuri- ous, mandatory vaccinations? Why are they receiving nothing? One reason is because the timetable is next to impossible to meet unless yours is a child who dies. Many symptoms are delayed andappear not to be life threatening. Is your child extremely sleepy, or are they actually suffering, ''a significant change in mental status? '' Is your child playing with his ear, or is this, ''repetitive move- ment of the part of his body a seizure? '' Is my new child just not hungry, or is there difficulty sucking, quote, an injury to the neurological function? These were signs my son showed, yet I did not know how to rec- ognize a severe vaccine reaction so that I could report it to the doc-tor, and I believe many parents have received to the same. Had thefacts been given to parents whose children received the contami-nated vaccine, parents could have been spared much wasted effort,and the child could have been committed to earlier and more mean-ingful treatment. We were told that, in order to receive compensation, injuries should have been indicated within 72 hours. How could this havepossibly been done if we didn 't even know it was the vaccine until nearly 2 years later? Second, it has been stated numerous times the burden of proof is on the petitioner. We are continually put in the position to provethat there was not some other cause. One, my child was normal at birth and until his first vaccine was developing normally. Two, he immediately showed signs of a reac-tion after the vaccine. Three, the vaccine itself showed to be a hotlot. Four, after many tests and no other explanation, Andy 's neu- rologist believed the vaccine to be the cause. We know of no other children unaffected who partook of this bad batch of vaccine. As far as we are concerned, 100 percent of thosewho were immunized by this bad batch were affected. This is morethan substantial proof. If you have a glass of water and 100 kidstake a drink and 100 get sick, there is something wrong with thatglass of water. The standards need to be changed and made retroactive. Much of the testimony given in these cases is more than required in anormal court of law. I have read that the NVCP was, ''not intended to serve as a compensation source for a wide range of naturally oc-curring illnesses and conditions. '' If this is the case and a petitioner has given substantial evidence that this was not a naturally occur-ring illness, the burden of proof should now be on the government to prove that it was not the vaccine. If this drug were an automobile, a car seat, a toaster, a toy, how much more aggressive action and remedy would be taken againstthe manufacturer in favor of the damaged individual? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 a qualified attorney who is willing not to receive compensation until the claim is settled is very hard. These attor-neys are required to cover all costs incurred for medical experts,copying charges, mailing charges, telephone communications, etc.,severely taxing theirs and the petitioner 's resources, while the gov- ernment attorneys receive regular pay, pay increases and otherbenefits and are able financially to access an unlimited amount ofresources. This makes for a very uneven legal playing field. Additionally, that can drag out the process, discouraging and stretching the petitioner 's resources to impossible limits. Do any of you know what it is to watch day in and day out a child who lives and moves essentially in only two dimensions onthe floor, have a 9-year-old who has never experienced runningthrough the grass, hitting a ball, stubbing his toe, telling his par-ents and family members that he loves them or requesting a giftfrom Santa? Realize that your child will always have to wear dia-pers, realize that your child will never participate in a team event,date, attend a prom or bring home a report card, or see a lonelychild in a corporate-produced solitary confinement, while that cor-poration thrives on the pain and deaths of children? Is it too much to ask that once a drug such as this is found to be deadly, its use is immediately stopped, participants notified,causes determined and corrected and injured children com-pensated? In closing, thousands and thousands of children are injured or die each year due to vaccines. However, I wonder how many morelike me are out there who do not know and maybe still do not knowthat their child 's death or injury was vaccine-related? And how many doctors are not reporting these events? I believe the truenumber of injured children is much higher, and these injuries donot just affect the child but the whole family. There is depression,resentment from other children for time taken away from them andtension between the husband and wife. But there is also good that comes from such a tragic event \u2014an appreciation for the small things, a hug or a touch, the voice ofsomeone saying I love you. It is often in the very midst of adversi-ties that we experience God 's love, the kindness of a neighbor, the prayers of a church family and a peace that could only comethrough faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. My prayer is that Andy 's story can make a difference, and I thank you for the opportunityto share it. God bless you all. [The prepared statement of Mrs. Dyer follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 I would like to have the information on that lot number that you can 't get. I will subpoena that today. We will sub- poena that, and if the company does not give us that information,I will have \u2014was it Lederle? Mrs. D YER. Lederle. Mr. B URTON . We will subpoena the president of the company be- fore the committee to ask us why they would not give us that infor-mation. And you said, to your knowledge, every child that got ashot from that lot was adversely affected? Mrs. D YER. It has not been proven to me otherwise. Mr. B URTON . I see. OK. I want you to know that, in defense of some of the doctors and maybe because of their own carelessness,many of them don 't know what is in these shots. Every Congress- man that is concerned about the flu vaccine, about getting the flubecause of anthrax, we 're all going over to the doctor 's office here at the Capitol, and we 're all getting flu shots, and what no Con- gressman knows or very few knows is that the shots we 're getting contains mercury, mercury, a toxic substance that they won 't even allow in topical dressings, and scientists all around the world in-cluding Canada have told us that mercury, even as a topical dress-ing, has adverse effects. But as a shot \u2014given in a shot as a pre- servative, that it can cause \u2014it is a contributing factor to autism and Alzheimer 's. A lot of us are older guys here in the Congress, and we 're getting shots we don 't even know contains mercury because it is called thi- merosal, and I don 't know why the FDA doesn 't do something about that. We 've talked to them until we 're blue in the face, and we'll ask them about that again at later hearings. You 'll hear about that, guys, again. You 'll be back up here again. But it really is kind of troubling that we 're not getting answers to these questions. Be sure to give me that lot number, and we will subpoena that today. Mr. Holder.Mr. H OLDER . Thanks very much for having me here. It was kind of short notice. I 'm real glad I could make it. I'm here on behalf of my son, Brandon Holder; and please let the record show I 'm from Bayonne, NJ. Anyway, Brandon was born on January 7, 1992. His Apgar was a 9 and 10. He was injured when he was 512months old on July 10, 1992, from his second DPT vaccination; and his first seizure oc-curred 6 hours later, which was a generalized seizure. We found out about NVIC by chance in April 1993 when Bran- don was hospitalized for multiple seizures. A woman whose childwas in the same room informed us of the NVIC at this time. There was a lot of difficulty finding an attorney who would han- dle the case, but we finally located Tom Gallagher in August 1994.The claim was filed in October 1994 and resolved in July 2000, atotal of 6 years from beginning to end. Throughout this period, Brandon 's development regressed daily. Medical bills piled up. His mother quit her job to care for him.Bankruptcy was filed, and I worked three jobs to make ends meet. We helplessly watched as the seizures gradually changed Bran- don from a brilliant child who could say his ABCs, count to 20, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May to the flag and meet most of his milestones to a child who has a limited vocabulary and the mentality of a 2-year-old. Upon the settling of the case, a lump sum was put into an irrev- ocable trust for Brandon by the laws that govern the State of NewJersey. Several things were outlined in Brandon 's life care plan as to how this money should be spent. One example of this was finan-cial assistance toward a home in light of our past monetary prob-lems due to Brandon 's condition, the logic being that with all of our lost time and wages that it was fair to assume that, being produc-tive individuals, we would have achieved home ownership by thistime. A specific amount was outlined, and to date the bank holdingthe trust has denied our request for assistance based on the lawsthat govern New Jersey. Basically, New Jersey law states that you must go to court to prove you need the assistance, while the Federal Government hasalready acknowledged and made provisions for the assistance thatis required within the life care plan. Keep in mind this is just oneexample of how difficult it is to access the money. The flaws in this program are to me very plain.First and most important for the child is the amount of time that case takes to settle results in lack of quality, early intervention forthe injured child and financial difficulty for most parents. I believethat had the case been settled in a more timely fashion, Brandonwould have been able to get sufficient early intervention from qual-ity professionals, and he may not have regressed as drastically. The second one is the inability of the Federal Government to ful- fill the terms of its settlement because of the laws that dictateState government. You should not have to prove your need forsomething to the State that has already been approved on a Fed-eral level. And if one of the primary purposes of this program is to provide fair and expedited compensation, I can agree that the settlementwas fair but far from expeditious. Claimants are left to suffer foryears before receiving compensation and then years after trying tojustify to their State government that which was already promisedby the Federal Government. And that is pretty much all I 've got. Thank you. Mr. D UNCAN [presiding]. All right. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Holder. [The prepared statement of Mr. Holder follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Mr. S HOEMAKER . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I 'd like to say that I 'm honored to be on the panel today with Dr. Block, who, as many of you know, is retiring aschairman of the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccinations;and I think we all should thank him for his role in that capacityand the work that he has done over the years. And I 'm honored to be with you today on that. I'm even more honored to be on the panel with the parents of Brandon and Andy and Dustin. These are stories that, unfortu-nately, I hear every day of my life. I brought along some of themembers of my office, and I 'd like them to stand up, if you don 't mind, please. These are some of the people that hear these storiesevery day of their lives, too, and I think they were entitled to behere today. Today, we represent over 400 children and adults in the Vaccine Compensation Act, and I think Dr. Block and I will agree on a lotof things here today. One is that adverse reactions to vaccinationsare rare. Vaccinations have done more for public health in thiscountry than \u2014I can 't say how many things. Clean water, vaccina- tions \u2014there are a few things that we can point to \u2014antibiotics \u2014 that have done a lot for this country. So both of us agree that thesevaccine adverse reactions are rare, but when they happen to yourchild, that is 100 percent. That is very real. There was something in Dr. Block 's testimony that I would like to read \u2014and he 's going to be reading it to you. He says, speaking for myself, I think it is sad that a child allegedly injured by a vac-cine can turn to the program for compensation, but a child injuredby a vaccine-preventable disease may have little or no access to ap-propriate care and no source for financial resources to support thatcare. I know what he 's talking about there, because the year I was born, my sister had polio. There was no program to pay for her ex-penses. There was no vaccine to protect her. So polio vaccinationhas been a very important thing in this country, and I recognizethat. But I think my sister would be the first person to say thatZachary Strain who lives up in Syracuse, NY, deserves the benefitsof this program. At 2 months of age, Zachary was given oral polio vaccination. Today he is paralyzed from the neck down, on a respirator for lifebecause he has polio from that vaccine. Now this was after the rec-ommendations had already been changed saying that they shouldgive the kill virus vaccine first. I don 't know why he was given an oral polio vaccine at 2 months, but he was, and today he 's para- lyzed from the neck down. And that little boy is a beautiful child. He is so smart. He 's been living with nurses all of his life. He has a personality that is yearsolder than him. He flirts with the nurses. But for the rest of hislife, he will be paralyzed and on a respirator. And my sister, whohad no compensation program when she developed polio, would bethe first to say that Zachary Strain needs to be taken care of. A little bit of an update on Rachel Zuhlke, who is our client. Ra- chel is back in the hospital, I 'm sorry to say. She is still having continuing problems. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May working now actively on the life care plan, because, as you pointed out, we did win the compensation in that case, the en-titlement portion of that case. There were a lot of reasons why Rachel 's case was delayed over the years. Some of them were my fault. Some of them were not myfault. Every time we 'd get ready to go to a hearing, Rachel would end up back in the hospital. Then we would have to go get morerecords and provide more records to the experts. But the important thing to understand about Rachel 's case is the treating doctors all said this was postvaccinal encephalopathy. Dr.Rick O 'Hearn in Dr. Weldon 's district, a great pediatrician, a won- derful man, said this is a postvaccinal encephalopathy. JohnSleasman, the head of immunology at Shands, who I think TimWestmorland knows, said this is postvaccinal encephalopathy. This wasn 't a case that should have ever been challenged, but it was. Experts were hired. So we had to hire experts and bring themin, and the expenses of these cases are unbelievable. There came a point in time when the government wanted to have all of the radiological films in that case. It would have cost $5,000or $6,000 to produce those films. I said I don 't have the money. At first, the government was going to pay for it. Then they said, no. No, we can 't do that because if we do it in this case it will set a precedent. We 'll have to do it in all the other cases. So I said to my client, I don 't have $5,000. I 'm representing hun- dreds of people. I don 't have \u2014you know, you can 't squeeze blood out of a turnip. I don 't have it. So she went and put $5,000 on her credit card to pay for those films to be sent. I don 't know how much money Mrs. Zuhlke spent over the years helping us to finance that case because I couldn 't pay the expenses. For me as an attorney, that is embarrassing. But do the math. We represent 400 children in the program. At $150 apiece for filing those cases, that is $60,000. If it only costsme $500 apiece to get the medical records, that is $200,000. If Ionly pay one expert $1,000 to get a report in each of those cases,that is $400,000. I have a half a million dollars outstanding in ex-penses in these cases. I have no more to give. I don 't care if this program is adversarial. Make it adversarial, but give us the resources to fight the battle. Give us the money tobe able to pay for the experts, to do things that I know need to bedone to win these case. I can win them, but I can 't win them with- out resources. I'm getting $190 an hour in this program. My colleagues who are out there in contingent fee litigation think I 'm an idiot. They think I'm crazy. But the reason I 'm still in this program is because of people like this. These are saints. They live day in and day out with dev-astated children. I could bring you videotapes that would make youbawl, because we see them every day. I saw one this morning, achild violent, throwing things around the room, his parents trying to control him. I can 't take that very much longer. I don 't care if it is adversarial. Give us the resources. There are three things that I asked for in September 1999. None of them have been done. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May paper I write is not going to be for Congress. It is going to be for the American Trial Lawyers Association magazine, sayingtort reform is dead. It does not work. Any child can go out thereon the street and be injured in an automobile accident, and theydon't have to file a lawsuit until they 're 18 years of age or older. And yet every day I get phone calls from people saying, 4 yearsago, 5 years ago my child was injured. And I have to sit there andexplain to them, I 'm sorry, the Federal Government won 't let you make a claim because it is more than 3 years from the onset ofyour symptoms. I know that some of you on this panel are lawyers. Read 51 Am. Jur. 2d Limitations of Actions, section 178 and 747. They are onthe front page. Every State in this Union has a tolling provisionfor minority, every State. This program, it 's 3 years from the onset of symptoms. It doesn 't matter if the parents didn 't find out about the fact that the vaccine caused the injury. It doesn 't matter that they didn 't find out about the program until it 's too late. They 're out of luck. And you know what 's even better? There is a vicious decision from the Federal Court of Appeals saying there is no equitable toll-ing in this program. There is no excuse for not filing on time. Now there 's a case out of New Jersey, the McDonald case, say- ing, well, I 'm sorry, if you didn 't file in that program soon enough, then you can 't file a State civil action either. So these kids cannot only not file in the program, they can 't go file a civil action either, if the McDonald case holds up. This has got to be changed. There is a glaring inequity in the program, that if you do nothing else, change the statute of limita-tions to what every State in this Union allows. Any complaint, anyobjection to doing that has been answered by all 50 State legisla-tures in the country. You can 't say, well, the proof is going to go away. It 's going to be hard to get evidence years later. If that 's true, it works against the claimants, not against the respondent,because we have the burden of proof. You can 't make any arguments against this. It 's already been ar- gued in all 50 legislatures, so do it. The second thing I 've asked for is a different burden of proof. I would invite you to look at page 6 of my testimony, because theChief Special Master has given you the language for legislation.He's a judge. He can 't legislate. But in the Stephens case, which is on page 6, I point out what he is proposing as a burden of proof. Work with the Chief Special Master. He 's a judge hearing these cases. He is inviting you. He is giving you this decision, saying, leg-islate it. I can 't. It's right there. I was encouraged to be at the ACCV meeting chaired by Dr. Block on December 5th, and the American Academy of Pediatricsmade a proposal about a new burden of proof which I thought wasvery promising, and I think Dr. Block will agree with that, that Ithink this is something where progress can be made. You have to understand, this compensation program is the model that is being used for distribution of funds, the September 11funds. This is the program that is being used. I don 't think it 's going to be run the same way for that. I hope the lawyers up inthe Eastern District of New York who are running this program VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May Special Master that 's been assigned to this is going to run it a little differently, but I 'll be anxious to see what happens with that program. The third thing that I 'm not even going to argue about, because nobody wants to hear a lawyer complain about fees. Nobody wantsto hear it. I 've written what I think about interim fees and costs. I don 't care what you do with fees. You know, you can deal with my wife. She 'll come up here and talk to you about fees. But cost, give us the cost to prosecute the cases. The chairman referred to thimerosal. The Institute of Medicine in Cambridge had a meeting, and they came back and said it 's bio- logically plausible that thimerosal in these vaccines \u2014and the amount was tremendous the kids were getting \u2014has caused neurodevelopmental disorders in some of these children. So it 's bio- logically plausible. And they 've recommended studies. Do you know how long it 's going take to do those studies \u20142 to 5 years at a mini- mum. So don 't put pressure on the Special Masters to rush me through the program. Don 't focus on how long it takes to get through the program. Focus on the reasons why it takes time to get through theprogram. The reasons why these cases don 't get through the pro- gram faster is because of the burden of proof, because we don 't have interim fees and costs so we can prosecute the cases. If you want to make the system move smoothly, do those two things. If you want it to be fair to all people, pass that statute oflimitations. Put it in there. It 's got to be done. I would also like to say \u2014I think it was Mr. Horn mentioned Tommy Sansone. Tommy Sansone 's father is a New York City po- liceman. He has a private bill that 's been on this Hill for some time. I would ask you to pass it. We represented the Sansone fam-ily. We 've brought them up here. We 've come to the Hill with him. When Moynihan was here, we were in his office. The Sansone billneeds to be passed. It 's a private bill. I had a call today, this morning before I came here, from a lady down in the western part \u2014I didn 't even know we bordered Ten- nessee, but she 's down close to Tennessee. And she said that she and six of her friends, nurses in a hospital, 6 years ago receivedhepatitis B vaccinations, all the same lot and everything else.There were seven of them. All seven of them developed MS-like dis-ease. One of them recently died. Now, I intend to investigate that. If I have to find Erin Brockovich and make her work for free, we 're going to investigate that and find out what happened out there. But there is a case where I have to say to her, ''ma'am, I can 't bring your case in this program. Because in August 1997, hepatitisB vaccine was added to the program, and your case could havebeen filed, but it had to be filed before August 1999. Sorry. It 's too late.'' I answer these questions every day.Thank you. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 We are working on some legislation to try and correct some of those things right now. And regarding thatprivate bill, I 'll have to know more about that. They 're very dif- ficult to get passed, but we 'll take a look at that. [The prepared statement of Mr. Shoemaker follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Block. Dr. B LOCK . Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I am delighted to have been invited here to discuss myobservations as Chair of the Advisory Commission on ChildhoodVaccines, on the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program,and to offer observations regarding the effectiveness of the pro-gram. I would like to thank Chairman Burton and also Mr. Wax-man for their continuing interest in the program and the healthand welfare of our children. As a pediatrician, I provide care for patients and their families; and as the Chair of an academic department, I teach pediatrics toyoung physicians in training. I have personal vivid memories ofwatching children severely disabled or dying of diseases that arenow preventable by vaccines. It is doubly difficult for me to watchtoday as a child suffers from one of those diseases, knowing thatsuch suffering could have most likely been avoided. I appreciated your comments, Chairman Burton, when you said vaccines are important parts of our public health system and wewant children to be protected against infectious diseases. Some will make the argument that vaccines exact a toll on chil- dren and, in rare instances, they do. Medicine cannot always be anexact science. There are no guarantees in medicine, just as thereare no guarantees in life. Mr. Chairman, you also said in your opening remarks at the pre- vious hearing that although the oral polio vaccine was a good pub-lic health tool in its time, it wasn 't perfect. If perfection is to be our goal, no government program, no vaccine, no part of medicalscience will ever achieve that goal. I have no doubt that the establishment of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was one of \u2014if not the \u2014major rea- son that we generally have an adequate supply of vaccines today.There is no doubt in my mind that the program works well, butwith some adversity or differences of opinion, especially in the non-table injury cases. However, I have been continually impressedover the last 3 years with the efforts of HHS and DOJ to decreasethe adversarial process. I have seen a continuing effort to achievethat goal. At the last ACCV meeting, we had the opportunity to discuss two very pertinent topics related to this committee 's concern that the program was too adversarial. The first was a proposal from theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics on an alternative standard for ad-judication of claims for non-table injuries. The second was a pres-entation by members of your staff on legislation that is currentlybeing drafted. We were pleased to see that most of the rec-ommendations that the ACCV made in 1999 were included in thedraft legislation. As former Chair of the ACCV, I hope that in thefuture the Commission can be a point of focus for discussions onvaccine-related issues, allowing the ACCV to collect the best infor-mation from which to advise the secretary. As a pediatrician, I envision the time when this program is not needed to the extent it is today. Because we might all agree, basedon reliable data, that we have vaccines that have extremely rareadverse events and because we have a national health care system VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May care for all of our disabled children, regard- less of the cause of their disability. Speaking for myself, or having been spoken for, I think it is sad that a child allegedly injured by a vaccine can turn to this programfor compensation, but a child injured by a vaccine-preventable dis-ease may have little or no access to appropriate care and no sourcefor financial resources to support that care. I have listened with concern to the stories told here today by par- ents who I don 't believe represent the majority of parents who have dealt with the program but who have perceptions of their experi-ences we should not ignore. I watched video clips presented by your staff of similar parent presentations at the ACCV meeting last week. I find it difficult torespond to perceptions, when the actual facts of a case are not pre-sented by both parties. But based on 3 years of experience with theACCV, I do feel these cases, while compelling, are isolated, unusualand emotional representations of a definite minority of cases com-ing through the program. Based on my personal conversations withand reports presented to the ACCV by past and current parentmembers of the Commission and presentations by petitioners ' at- torneys and on data reviewed at each meeting by the ACCV, I be-lieve the program works quickly and generously in most cases. I know that I speak not only for myself but also for the next Chair of the ACCV when I say that we welcome the opportunityto continue working with the public, with professional organiza-tions and with Members of Congress to continuously improve theNational Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and to ensure asafe future for our children. It is difficult, Mr. Chairman, to listen to accounts from parents whose lives and whose children 's lives have been affected the way these parents today have had to experience and some of the par-ents that you listened to before. You share now a common experi-ence with my everyday life, but the children that I hear about andcare for are not vaccine injury children but are children with dis-abilities and other illnesses that have nothing to do with the pur-pose of today 's hearing. I would go back to my statement that I am concerned that we have a program, maybe perhaps needing improvement, to helpthese families and would hope that some day we won 't have to argue about these things because their needs would be covered bythe same program that would cover all the children in this country. I want to thank you for the opportunity to express my views on the importance of the program and the ACCV and the critical rollthey will continue to play in preserving the health of our children.More dialog with the ACCV will only benefit us all. I'll be happy to answer questions later. [The prepared statement of Dr. Block follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Let me start off the question period by making a comment. I was never really too concerned about breast cancer until my wife became a victim, and she 's very ill right now. And then you start looking into it, and you start realizing that things that couldbe done or should be done or haven 't been done. My granddaughter received a hepatitis B shot, and within 3 hours she quit breathing. She was rushed to the hospital, and mydaughter gave her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and, thank God,she survived. Now there are those who say that had nothing to dowith the hepatitis B shot, but the people at the hospital truly be-lieved it. It was a problem. My grandson \u2014and I only have two grandchildren. My grandson, he received nine shots in 1 day, and we found out that the thimero-sal that was in those shots included mercury, and within a veryshort time he became autistic, running around himself, banging hishead against the wall, cupping his hand, screaming and holleringincessantly, and before that he was normal. Now, you know, there will be people who say those are just coin- cidences, but it happened to me personally, my granddaughter andmy grandson. We used to have 1 out of every 10,000 children \u2014and they could have been off in the statistics on that, it may have been 1 in9,000 \u2014but they estimated 1 in 10,000 children were autistic. But now it 's fact \u2014fact that 1 in 500 nationwide are autistic, and in some parts of the country \u2014it approaches 1 in 200 in the Northwest of this country. We 've got data to prove that. Now when I listen to pediatricians and doctors who say, you know, we 're doing everything that can be done and there 's no indi- cation that the vaccines are causing this. Then what is causing it?My grandson got about 50 times what the normal amount of mer-cury that a child would have or an adult would have in 1 day innine shots, and he became autistic almost immediately. And yet,you know, the people at CDC and FDA and HHS all say, you know,there is nothing that can prove that. We can 't prove that. But I can tell you, 1 in 500 kids nationally are autistic. You know, that ispretty bad when it used to be 1 in 10,000. That is a pretty big in-crease, 20 times increase. So, you know, we have some real problems with that. And as I said before, I would say most doctors don 't know thimerosal con- tains mercury, because the Capitol Hill physician, who is one of thefinest men and nicest doctors I know, Admiral Issold over there,when I said, do you know that these vaccines have mercury inthem? He says, no, they don 't. And I said, look at this; and I got the insert out and showed him thimerosal. And thimerosal contains mercury as a preservative be-cause they don 't want to have single-shot vials. They put 10 shots in one vial. And the Members of Congress that are getting theseshots don 't even know it. And yet Canadians and scientists from around the world say and they showed us \u2014we had a video here showing that the sleeve that surrounds the nerves in the brain are destroyed by the mercury im-mediately upon a very minute amount of mercury upon contact,and there are scientists all over the place that are saying that Alz- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 autism and other neurological disorders are being caused by the mercury and other substances that are in vaccinesand that are in the environment. So, you know, we really need to take a close look at this. I 'm not denigrating what you said. I 'm just telling you that we need more research, No. 1. No. 2, there needs to be a more humanistic or humane attitude toward these people who are suffering like this. These people arereally suffering. She lost her son, she went through all of this stuff,and yet when you get the CDC and the FDA and the Justice De-partment and they come up here, you know, I don 't know how they defend this stuff. Now, let me ask you a few questions, because we 've got some votes coming up here. After 8 years of fighting to get compensation,the Special Master ruled in your favor, Mrs. Barton, in 1999. Atthat point did the Justice Department ask that your lawyers agreenot to \u2014wanted you to agree not to have that published? That 's what you said in your testimony. Mrs. B ARTON . Yes. Mr. B URTON . Why do you think they did that? Mrs. B ARTON . They didn 't want the case to be cited in any other cases, in any other people coming up \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . So they didn 't want somebody with similar problems \u2014\u2014 Mrs. B ARTON . Right. Mr. B URTON [continuing]. Being able to use that case as a basis for a claim? Mrs. B ARTON . Exactly. Mr. B URTON they were blackjacking you? Mrs. B ARTON . Well, I called it extortion. Mr. B URTON . Well, either way, blackjack, blackmail, extortion, it all amounts to the same thing. Mrs. B ARTON . Yes. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Shoemaker, you 're an attorney who represents lots of families in this program. What is the practical effect of a de-cision that goes against the government not being published? Mr. S HOEMAKER . Any unpublished decision cannot be used as precedent. Mr. B URTON . So if you didn 't agree to this condition, Mrs. Barton, and you insisted that the decision be published, the Justice Depart-ment would have said what? Mrs. B ARTON . Well, it was put to me through my attorney, Mr. Milmoe. The Justice Department attorney said that if I didn 't agree to it being unpublished, that he would file another appeal. Mr. B URTON . And drag it out? Mrs. B ARTON . And drag it out. Mr. B URTON . And you were very sick at that point? Mrs. B ARTON . And he knew that. Mr. B URTON . I see my time is expired. Do you gentlemen have questions at this time? Judge.Mr. D UNCAN . Yes. Mr. B URTON . I'll have more questions later, and let me just say, Judge, before you start, we have about 11 minutes on the clock, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May 'll go to 5 minutes, so we 'll give you your time, and then we'll move. Mr. D UNCAN . OK. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shoemaker, you heard Dr. Block say that it 's his experience that this program has been very quick and generous. Has it beenyour experience that the program has operated very quickly? Wehave a staff memo here that says the program was intended to beless adversarial than civil litigation and was intended by Congressto compensate quickly, easily and with certainty and generosity,and yet all of these cases that I hear about, they seem to take sev-eral years. What is the average length of time and what has beenyour experience in all of these cases you 've handled? Mr. S HOEMAKER . Let me repeat what I said. I don 't think that the problem is a problem of delay. I think the problem is the rea-sons for the delay. In other words, if I am given the resources, ifI am given interim fees and costs so I can finance these cases, soI can pay for things expeditiously, so I can hire the experts I need,I can move these cases through the system much more quickly. I tell all of my clients \u2014for instance, hepatitis B clients, I tell them, look, here 's the situation. If you want to go to a hearing right away, I 'll take it to a hearing right away. But in my opinion, as the state of science is today, we have a good chance of losing. There are two things that have to come together for me to win a case. The science, the medical knowledge has to go up and reacha level where I have enough proof, and I 'm trying to get Congress to reduce the burden of proof so that those two lines will crosssooner rather than later. Mr. D UNCAN . Let me ask you this. I was a plaintiff 's trial lawyer and a judge before I came to Congress, and you know and I knowthat there are certain \u2014there are some members of the profession out there who might take advantage of that if we had some sortof unlimited expense program. So have you come up with or couldyou come up with some type of recommendation on some type ofexpense-type program that you think would have some reasonablelimitations on it? Or have you thought about that? Mr. S HOEMAKER . Yes, sir. As a matter of fact \u2014\u2014 Mr. D UNCAN . What have been your average expenses on one of these cases? Mr. S HOEMAKER . Expenses can vary, but they can certainly ap- proach $5,000 to $10,000, and I 'm not even doing the cases right. I mean, you 've been a trial lawyer. You know how much a case can cost. Mr. D UNCAN . I know about that. Mr. S HOEMAKER . I know how much money I would like to spend on a case. Mr. D UNCAN . Have you made a recommendation? Mr. S HOEMAKER . I was just going to say Congressman Weldon had introduced a bill, H.R. 1287, which I think does address thatissue, and I would encourage anybody to support H.R. 1287 be-cause it does all three things I talked about. Mr. D UNCAN . How do we strike the balance between, you know, what everybody says has been a very effective program and wedon't want to scare people away from having their children vac- cinated yet still educate the public? Because, as I said in my state- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May while ago, it 's a very sad thing that people take their chil- dren in for something that they think is good for them and thenthese things happen. And I think probably all three of these par-ents would tell you they had no idea. Did any of you have any ideathat there would be adverse reactions when you took your childrenin? Mrs. B ARTON . Not at all. After the fact, I 've done a lot of research on vaccine reactions, and there are some kids that are high risk foradverse reactions, and I think that certain \u2014you know, that doctors definitely need to be aware of that especially. What scares me is when they do these big, you know, come to the mall and we 'll vaccinate, you know, 200 children for free, and the doctors don 't know these kids at all and don 't know their medi- cal histories. Mr. D UNCAN . Should we require that pediatricians give out un- derstandable pamphlets after these shots are given, telling parentsthat if they see any of these symptoms that something should bedone? Or what is being done? Mr. S HOEMAKER . Your Honor, that actually already is required. Dr. Block and I were talking about that earlier, that under thestatute there is a provision that says that there 's supposed to be forms developed that are supposed to be given to all the parentswhen their children are vaccinated. The form is supposed to adviseas to the risks, the benefits and so forth. It 's all supposed to say in there that there is this compensation program so that peoplewould be made aware of the program. That 's by statute. That 's al- ready in the program. Mr. D UNCAN . Is that a fairly new thing? Were all three of you given that information? Mr. H OLDER . Back when Brandon got his shot, all we got was that he might have a febrile seizure and he might be uncomfort-able, to give him some Tylenol. I believe that things have changed,from what I understand, to what Mr. Shoemaker is saying. Mr. S HOEMAKER . Actually, it has been there since the beginning of this program, but the problem is there 's no penalty for it. For failure to comply, there 's nothing that says if a doctor doesn 't do it, so what? And a lot of \u2014as Dr. Block and I were talking about, a lot of doc- tors, you 're dealing with a short period of time that you 're dealing with a parent. You don 't have a lot to do as a pediatrician. You know, if you go overboard on this thing, the fear is you 're going to frighten parents. I mean, there are a lot of issues involved in this,as you know. But it is statutory right now. There is no penalty for failing to do it, but there is a statutory provision that says the Secretary isto develop these forms, and they are supposed to be handed out tothe parents at the time, and I think they are even supposed to besigned. I 'm not sure if the signature is required. Mrs. B ARTON . Can I make one comment \u2014\u2014 Mr. D UNCAN . Yes. Mrs. B ARTON [continuing]. To Dr. Block? You stated that there are kids out there with all these other diseases that, you know,that hopefully we 'll be able to help pay for children with all dis- eases. This was something that was mandatory. This was some- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 we were forced to give our children. It 's not like it was just a random luck or luck of the draw or a terrible tragedy thatmy child got this disease. Our children were forced to get thesevaccines. So it 's a little bit different than just a disease that would come about randomly. I believe it is, anyway. Mr. D UNCAN . Well, my time is up, and we 've got to go vote, but I want to thank all of you for being here and this testimony you 've given today. Mr. W ELDON [presiding]. The Chair will now recess this hearing for approximately 10 minutes to give the members time to go voteand return. [Recess.]Mr. B URTON [presiding]. The committee will reconvene and come to order. I want to apologize for the duration. Would the previous panel come back up \u2014Mrs. Barton, Mrs. Dyer, Mr. Holder, Mr. Shoemaker, and Dr. Block. Let's get back to our questioning. Mr. Shoemaker, you 've been a counselor for a long time on these kinds of problems. On Mrs. Bar-ton's case, if they had appealed it and had not settled with her, based upon her not publishing the results, how much longer wouldthat compensation have been delayed? Mr. S HOEMAKER . It could have been years. I mean, an appeal typically goes to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, to a judge first,and then from there it would go on to the U.S. Court of Appealsfor the Federal Circuit; so it could take a considerable period oftime. Mr. B URTON . So you think this was kind of a blackjack tactic that they used? Mr. S HOEMAKER . Well, I actually agree with Mr. Waxman in his comments, because he was saying the same thing that you 're say- ing, that is, that we shouldn 't have any unpublished decisions. It kind of reminds me of the Firestone tire situation, where for yearsplaintiffs ' attorneys were settling those cases under seal so that they couldn 't release \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . People were getting killed, yes. Mr. S HOEMAKER . That 's exactly right. And I don 't think we 're dealing with the same thing here, but it 's important for lawyers, like me, working in the program to have these precedents whenthey are favorable. I think also there 's a digest of opinions that 's used by the claims court that needs to be published on the Web site so that lawyerscan easily research this area. There are a lot of lawyers out therearound the country that maybe have one or two cases in the pro-gram. They can 't possibly know what we know, representing hun- dreds of cases, and they need access to some research so they knowwhat the law is. Mr. B URTON . It's obvious why the Health and Justice Depart- ments didn 't want that published, because of that very reason. We received a letter last night from the Justice Department say- ing that in the Barton case it was in both parties ' interest to have the case unpublished in lieu of appeal. What do you think about that argument?Mr. S HOEMAKER . You 'd have to ask Ms. Barton. Mr. B URTON . What do you think about that, Ms. Barton? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 that one more time? Mr. B URTON . We received a letter last night from the Justice De- partment saying that, in your case, it was in both parties ' interest, yours and the Government 's, to have the case unpublished in lieu of appeal. What do you think about that?Ms. B ARTON . No. The only reason I agreed was just for the fact that\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . They pressured you? Ms. B ARTON [continuing]. That I needed to get it over with. I felt like I couldn 't go through any more appeals. I mean, had we gone through more appeals, I 'm sure that we would have won. It would have kept coming back in our favor. ButI just didn 't feel like I could keep going through it. So maybe they 're saying it was in both parties ' interest because of my illness, because I was sick. They 're saying it was that it was in my best interest to not publish it because \u2014but still it goes back to their saying that they would appeal if I didn 't. Mr. B URTON . You don 't agree? Ms. B ARTON . I don 't agree, no. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Shoemaker, has the Government ever employed this tactic with any of your other clients? Mr. S HOEMAKER . I can 't think of that specific tactic. I had a situ- ation one time where an attorney tried to tie my fees to a settle-ment, and I immediately expressed indignation; and when I didthat, the attorney realized right away that it was inappropriateand, in fairness, backed off and said, no, that wasn 't right. You have to understand that 's not issue today too and this pro- gram \u2014if I were only interested in making fees and making a liv- ing, I would rush these cases through the program. I wouldn 't care if I won or lost because I 'm going to get my fee and expenses any- way. But I can 't live with myself if I do that, and that 's one of the reasons why I want you to lower the burden of proof and give usthe resources so that we can win these cases. Because, Congress-man Burton, I want to assure you of something: The thrill of vic-tory is never as great as the agony of defeat in these cases. It 's not the same thing. Mr. B URTON . Ms. Barton, how did you feel when your lawyer told you that you had to make this kind of a choice, either agree to nothave it published or face appeal? What was your thought? Ms. B ARTON . It was agonizing. It made me feel, like I said, that I was being blackmailed; that I was \u2014it was either, take the money and don 't let anybody else ever be able to use this information again, or don 't take the money and go through years and years more of appeals. Mr. S HOEMAKER . Chairman Burton. Mr. B URTON . Yes, sir? Mr. S HOEMAKER . Could I just raise one issue. You had talked with Ms. Dyer about subpoenaing information about the numbersof doses per lot. Mr. B URTON . In her case in Tennessee, right. Mr. S HOEMAKER . Right. And I think it 's important to understand that we need that data in all cases because there 's no way we can determine whether or not a case is a hot lot unless we know the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May You may have one lot that has 10 reactions re- ported and another lot that has 100 reactions reported; and thatmay be perfectly normal because the one lot may be 10 times asbig, but we don 't know that until we have the numbers of doses per lot. That information we 've been trying to get for years. The manu- facturers say it 's proprietary, which I don 't have any clue why. It doesn 't make any sense \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Let me ask Ms. Dyer, you did contact Merck about this? Ms. D YER. I'm sorry. Say that again. Mr. B URTON . No, it wasn 't Merck. Who was it? Ms. D YER. Lederle. Mr. B URTON . Lederle. You did contact \u2014\u2014 Ms. D YER. I gathered my information through the FDA Freedom of Information branch. Mr. B URTON . I know. But did you contact Lederle about this? Ms. D YER. No, I did not. Mr. B URTON . Whom did you contact who said that this was pro- prietary and wouldn 't give you that information? Ms. D YER. I don 't understand the question. I 'm sorry. Who did I contact? Mr. B URTON . You said that they wouldn 't give you the informa- tion, and we said we 'd subpoena the information on those lots. Ms. D YER. Right. I was told by the FDA when I asked them how many shots come out of a bulk of vaccine, that that was confiden-tial information. Mr. B URTON . And they said they couldn 't tell you? Ms. D YER. Yes. Mr. B URTON . I see. Ms. B ARTON . I was told by Lederle, and I asked the same question \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . And they said the same thing? Mrs. B ARTON . Yes, and \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . That sounds like both the FDA and the companies are trying to protect the company. Ms. B ARTON . What they said is that certain \u2014you know, it just depends. Some lots will have 700 doses; some will have 1,000; somewill have \u2014but it 's confidential as to how many \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . No, I understand. I understand. But it sounds like the FDA is scratching the back \u2014and that probably bothers them for me to say this \u2014scratching the back of those pharmaceutical companies because they 're concerned about the liability exposure. Mr. S HOEMAKER . Your Honor, there is actually information that\u2014we know that the Government has this information because there was an article published, and I can provide that to you,which compared the two manufacturers of hepatitis B vaccine; andit stated that the one manufacturer had four times the rate of reac-tions as the other manufacturer. Interestingly enough, when you go back and look at the data that they submitted, when they were having them tested to approve thevaccines, that same pattern held true. The conclusion of the articlewas that, well, we don 't know why this is, but it probably does not mean anything. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May think it means something if one vaccine manufacturer has a rate of reaction that 's four times greater than another manu- facturer; and to be able to publish that and state that, they hadto know the numbers of doses per lot in order to make that calcula-tion. So that information is available to the Government, not justthe manufacturers. Mr. B URTON . Well, why do you think that the FDA wouldn 't allow a claimant to have information \u2014\u2014 Mr. S HOEMAKER . I think you can talk to NVIC. They have tried to get this information under the Freedom of Information Act.We've tried to get it. It 's been \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Well, what 's your opinion? Why do you think they don 't want to let it out? Mr. S HOEMAKER . I think because if you did it, you 're probably going to find hot lots. You 're probably going to find lots where \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . So why wouldn 't you want the hot lots \u2014\u2014 Mr. S HOEMAKER . I think you want that information \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . I know, but why would the FDA and the manufac- turer not want the hot lots revealed? Mr. S HOEMAKER . I don 't know and I 've been trying to figure out why that would be considered proprietary. I mean, it \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . No. But I mean, assuming that, take the propri- etary out of it, why do you think they wouldn 't want to know? Mr. S HOEMAKER . I can 't speak for \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . You don 't want to speculate about that? Well, I 'll speculate on it. Ms. B ARTON . I think they wouldn 't want any more claims \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Lawsuits or many claims. Ms. B ARTON . Right. Mr. B URTON . Right. I think that 's exactly right, and I 've had a suspicion for a long time that a lot of the people that work at FDAand HHS have direct or indirect ties with pharmaceutical compa-nies, and they protect them; and it 's really sad. And when we look at the financial disclosure forms, we have found people on the advisory committees that make recommenda-tions to the FDA on drugs being put on the market for vaccinationpurposes. We have found conflicts of interest. What was that vac-cine we had? The RotaShield vaccine, the chairman of that advisory committee had stock in a company that was working on the RotaShield virus,a vaccine. And they brought in three people from the FDA, or fourpeople, to vote on that because they didn 't have a quorum present; and they urged them to vote for it, and within a year children haddied. There had been all kinds of problems with it, and it had notbeen properly tested even though there had been concerns \u2014some concerns about it at the advisory committee meeting. But it lookedlike, because the chairman was recommending it, they went aheadwith it. And he had a financial interest. That 's sad. And this brings up a question about these other things like this, these hot lots and the statistical information we 'd like to have, be- cause it sounds like, because of this arrangement, that there arepeople at the FDA that are trying to protect interests that theymay have with pharmaceutical companies, either prospective or inthe past. They may have worked for a pharmaceutical company or VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May working for one or they get benefits from them in one way or the other. And some people may say, that really is a pretty serious charge to level, but I will tell you, I have a lot of friends who are doctors,and it 's a constant thing for the pharmaceutical companies to be spending a great deal of money taking people out and wining themand dining them, who are in governmental agencies, taking themon trips, as well as the doctors themselves who use those products.And so there 's a real interplay there that I think does a disservice to the American people, and that 's one of the reasons why we 're going to have probably about 14 or 15 of these hearings in the nextyear, and the FDA is going to be over here listening to this andasking questions about it. Mr. S HOEMAKER . When you have a couple hours for me to talk about flu vaccine, I 'd be glad to \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . I'll get back to you on that because those of us who were concerned with the anthrax threat \u2014and all of our mail has been taken away from us; we haven 't had mail in the Capitol for 6 weeks now, 7 weeks, and it 's because of the anthrax scare. So we have been told that we should all get a vaccine for \u2014the flu vaccine because the threat is there that we may be exposed to anthrax.And it looks like the flu, and so we have to be able to protect our-selves against the flu so we 'll know what it is if it hits; and so we're all forced to take the vaccine in the form of a shot, and every one of us is getting thimerosal or mercury in that vaccine. We don 't have any choice. And most of the doctors, as I 've said, don 't even know what 's in there. Let me get back to the questions here. Let me go to Ms. Dyer.When Andy and your other children were vaccinated, did your doctor or the nurse tell you there was a chance there would be anadverse reaction and how to recognize it? Ms. D YER. Before we recessed I wanted to say yes, I was given the pamphlet that lists reactions. I don 't remember the exact num- bers, but a one-in-so-many-thousand chance of death, one-in-so-many-thousand chance of seizure. The thing that I disagree with is the fact that a lot of these symptoms appear to be non-life-threatening. Parents, unless youhave a child who has a seizure or you know somebody with a sei-zure disorder, I don 't think that a lot of people realize that just a stare off into one direction could be a seizure, this right here,which is what my son started doing \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . You didn 't recognize that as a problem? Ms. D YER. You don 't recognize that as a seizure \u2014or the doctors \u2014\u2014 Ms. B ARTON . Or the shivers that I said my son was having at night. Ms. D YER. They tell you that a child being sleepy is normal. Mr. B URTON . Let me ask you, were you asked to sign a form stat- ing that you 'd been told your child might have an adverse reaction? Ms. D YER. Yes. Mr. B URTON . But you thought it would be a minor thing? Ms. D YER. Seizure, death, swelling at the injectionsite \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . So you were aware that? VerDate Mr. B URTON . OK. In your testimony you stated that your petition for compensation for your child 's vaccine injury was rejected in 1999. How do you provide for his care now? How do you take care of the financial requirements? Ms. D YER. It's difficult. We have parents that live nearby that help us out quite a bit. My husband is self-employed, and becauseof Andy 's injury, I can 't really work outside the home. We have a church family that helps provide a lot of financial assistance whenwe need it. Mr. B URTON . But you have an unusual financial burden because of that? Ms. D YER. Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . How much extra does it cost to care for Andy each year over that of your other kids? Ms. D YER. With therapies and extra things that he needs that his insurance does not cover, I would guess as much as $9,000 to$10,000 a year. Mr. B URTON . Really? Did you find out about the number of adverse events reported in that lot of vaccine that Andy received? Ms. D YER. I contacted the FDA Freedom of Information branch and\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . So you only got it from the FOA, Freedom of \u2014or FOI? Ms. D YER. Right. And after 2 years and during those 2 years never being told that there was a relationship, a friend of minementioned that she had seen a show on the vaccine and the shots;and so I called his physician and got the information as far as thedrug company name and lot number and called the FDA. Now, when I called the FDA, you were mentioning about how maybe they were scratching each other 's back. I felt really put off. They asked me why I needed that information, has your son al-ready been vaccinated? Well, if he 's already been vaccinated, you don 't need that infor- mation. They did not want to give it to me freely. I mean, I hadto fight for it. Mr. B URTON . Are you aware of whether the FDA ever contacted Lederle about this hot lot, or if they were ever found to be in viola-tion of good manufacturing practices regarding this product? Ms. D YER. Not to my knowledge. Mr. B URTON . So you don 't know if this hot lot \u2014where they had all of these adverse reactions, if the FDA even contacted Lederle? Ms. D YER. Not to my knowledge. Mr. B URTON . I want to subpoena any records that the FDA has regarding Lederle and this hot lot. I want to get the hot lot num-ber, and I want to send a subpoena over to the FDA regarding any correspondence between them and Lederle regarding that. Ms. B ARTON . I know that Dateline did a show that was com- pletely about hot lots on DPT vaccines. Mr. B URTON . I understand that, but the point is \u2014\u2014 VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May I'm just saying that they talked with the FDA and Lederle. So they did a show completely about the hot lots and cer-tain ones. I don 't know if yours was one of them. Ms. D YER. Mine was not one of those. Mr. B URTON . Well, in any event, was all that information ex- posed in that television show? Ms. B ARTON . Not the number of doses, but the hot lots were there. Mr. B URTON . Well, what we want to find out is the number of\u2014\u2014 Ms. B ARTON . Is the number of doses, right. Mr. B URTON . What we want to find out is the number of doses, the number of adverse reactions, whether or not there was any cor-respondence between Lederle and the FDA; and if so, we want tosee it. OK? What 's the long-term prognosis \u2014I need you to pay attention to me now because we 've to get through a lot of work here. I 've got these people from the FDA and the Justice Department that aregoing to have to testify. What is the long-term prognosis ran for Andy?Ms. D YER. Andy 's condition right now, he 's severely develop- mentally delayed. Mentally, he 's at an 18-month-old level. Mr. B URTON . How old is he? Ms. D YER. He's 9. Mr. B URTON . He's 9 and he has an 18-month-old \u2014\u2014 Ms. D YER. He's at an 18-month-old level, mentally. Physically, he is very strong. He 's able to crawl on all fours and actually able to pull himself to a stand, but he will never be a normal child. He willalways require assistance in everything that he does. Mr. B URTON . And I 'm sure you worry about what 's going to hap- pen when he gets older and you get older. Ms. D YER. Yes, sir. He 's 9 years old and weighs 100 pounds now, so\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . I understand. Ms. D YER[continuing]. He 's a big boy. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Holder, we haven 't asked you a great many questions about your situation. Would you like to expand and ex-pound on that a little bit before we change to the next panel? Mr. H OLDER . Were there any specific questions you had? Mr. B URTON . Well, you heard the kind of problems that Ms. Bar- ton and Ms. Dyer had. Do you have any comments regarding theway\u2014I know you mentioned the State in which you live is not liv- ing up to the same standards that other States are, or the FederalGovernment. Mr. H OLDER . Well, no. See, I understand more now and speak to Mr. Balbier that \u2014and I did understand before that the State laws are really trying to protect the interests of the child, but I thinkmy point of contention with that was that you were awardedmoney for specific things, but yet you still had to go through theState again; and with Brandon 's disability and a job and it 's just very hard to try to fight for all of the things that were alreadypromised, once again. Mr. B URTON . But you did get a settlement? Mr. H OLDER . Yes. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 And you 're not dissatisfied with the way you were handled? Mr. H OLDER . I am dissatisfied with the length of time that it took to settle the case. It was a total of 6 years that it took for \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . And during that time you had to have an attorney, you had to pay expenses and all that sort thing, and it was a realburden on the family? Mr. H OLDER . Yes, very much a burden. And again \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Did you recoup any of those moneys that you spent during that 6 years? Mr. H OLDER . Yes. Those moneys for unreimbursed medical and any legal were reimbursed through the lump sum. The most important thing about the length of time, to me, is the impact it has on the child, the additional therapies, professionalhelp, these quality cares that he could have been getting all alongwere not gotten. And my point with that is, I don 't know if it would have made him better, but I never will know if it would haveimproved \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . So if they had moved quicker, you think he might have gotten additional treatment that would have helped? Mr. H OLDER . Absolutely. I believe that to the bone, yes. Mr. B URTON . I think that 's an important point that we need to look at too. Anything else I need to \u2014oh, yes, Dr. Block \u2014\u2014 Mr. H OLDER . There was also \u2014oh, I 'm sorry. Mr. B URTON . Go ahead. Sure. Mr. H OLDER . There was also \u2014in 1998 they did an MRI, and there was a shadow. And the doctor clearly stated on the bottomthat this shadow was because the child had turned his head. Andthe Special Master had tried to just throw it out based on that, im-mediately had it dismissed; and we had to run and get the recordsand say, you know, look, it says this. But they did try to throw itout because \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . There was a shadow where, on his brain? Mr. H OLDER . The shadow \u2014yeah, in the MRI. And the doctor who read it clearly stated, this is because the child moves; and he wasshaking his head, and they \u2014it seemed as if they just chose to ig- nore that little part and \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . So the constant shaking of his head was causing additional damage; is what they were saying? Mr. H OLDER . I'm sorry? Mr. B URTON . The shaking of his head was causing damage or\u2014\u2014 Mr. H OLDER . No, no. He was saying the shadow that was show- ing on his MRI was because he had moved his head during theMRI\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Oh, I see. Mr. H OLDER [continuing]. And the interpretation of the defense was, oh, they looked at the MRI and they said ''shadow, '' but they omitted the part that the doctor said it was because he had movedhis head toward it, trying to get the case dismissed. So that \u2014to me, that is an example of being adversarial and not, you know, having the full information and trying to have it tossedout because of this. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 you did get restitution? Mr. H OLDER . Well, yes, sir. Absolutely. Mr. B URTON . OK. So your main concern is that it took too long? Mr. H OLDER . It took too long, correct. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Block, do you have any opinion on whether the nonpublication of decisions is appropriate? Dr. B LOCK . No, sir. I don 't understand that legal implication at all. Mr. B URTON . Do you think they should be published? Dr. B LOCK . I don 't know what the legal standards would be for that. I would probably have to defer to my lawyer friends for that. Mr. B URTON . I know, but you 're a doctor and you 're a pediatri- cian. Ms. Barton, she was told they would settle her claim if theydidn't publish this. As a pediatrician knowing the kind of problem that she had, do you believe that should be published? Dr. B LOCK . Well, Mr. Chairman, it 's very, very hard to give a specific answer to a case, when I don 't know the details, and to offer a legal opinion. In science, we think all facts should be beforeeverybody. Whether that 's true in the legal arena or not, I just don't know, but it certainly would be true in science. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Well, I want to thank you very, very much. I hope you 'll stay around for just a little bit because we 're going to have the people from the agencies involved to testify now and ask them some ques-tions, and it might be of interest to you and help us in the future. The next panel, we would like to come forward now. Mr. Balbier, Mr. Harris, Mr. Euler, would you please stand so we can have yousworn, please. [Witnesses sworn.]Mr. B URTON . I appreciate your being so patient today. I 'm sorry we have had so doggone many votes. Do any of you have an opening statement you want to make?Mr. Balbier, do you have an opening statement?Mr. B ALBIER . Yes, I do. Mr. B URTON . OK. STATEMENTS OF THOMAS E. BALBIER, JR., DIRECTOR, DIVI- SION OF VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION, OFFICE OF SPE-CIAL PROGRAMS, HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES AD- MINISTRATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMANSERVICES; PAUL CLINTON HARRIS, DEPUTY ASSISTANT AT-TORNEY GENERAL, CIVIL DIVISION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OFJUSTICE, CONCERNING THE NATIONAL VACCINE INJURYCOMPENSATION PROGRAM; AND JOHN EULER, DIRECTOR,NATIONAL VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM, U.S.DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Mr. B ALBIER . Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I 'm pleased to be here this afternoon to talk to you about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. And,first, I would like to thank the members of this committee andChairman Burton, Representative Waxman, and Dr. Weldon inparticular for your interest in the program and your participationin our ongoing efforts to improve the program. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May of Health and Human Services is committed to making this program more expeditious and less adversarial. I amvery encouraged by the recent developments toward this commongoal that have taken place. At the committee 's last hearing on November 1, I was asked if I would be willing to work with this committee and its staff to craftlegislation aimed at improving the operation of the program thatcould receive broad consensus for approval within the legislativeand executive branches of government. In response to that request,I can report that substantial progress already has been made dueto extensive cooperation with committee staff. On November 19, the chairman of the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines wrote a letter to invite Chairman Burton andRepresentative Waxman, or your staffs, to the ACCV 's December 5 meeting to present Chairman Burton 's newly drafted legislative proposal to make improvements to the program. Both of you ac-cepted this invitation and sent your staffs to the ACCV meeting todiscuss your proposed legislation. I would like to thank ChairmanBurton and Representative Waxman for allowing your staff to taketime out of their busy schedules to present this draft bill at theACCV meeting. The ACCV is comprised of nine voting members including three medical professionals, three attorneys and three members of thegeneral public. Two of the medical professional members are re-quired to have expertise in pediatrics; one of the attorneys is re-quired to represent claimants under the program and one attorneyis required to represent a vaccine company. Of the general publicmembers, two are required to be parents of children injured by thevery rare but serious adverse reactions to childhood vaccines. Many of the provisions in Chairman Burton 's draft bill are the same as those proposed by HHS in its proposed amendments sentto Congress in June 1999, but never introduced as a bill. Theseproposals were developed based on strong consensus recommenda-tions of the ACCV and enjoy the support of the current administra-tion. We are looking forward to working very closely with Chairman Burton, Representative Waxman, the Department of Justice, andthe ACCV to make needed improvements to the National VaccineInjury Compensation Program. I'll be pleased to answer any additional questions you may have. Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Balbier. you have an opening statement? Mr. H ARRIS . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . OK. Mr. H ARRIS . Good afternoon, Chairman Burton, Ranking Minor- ity Member Waxman, members of this committee. Thank you forthe opportunity again to appear before you to talk about the Vac-cine Injury Compensation Program. With me this afternoon is JohnEuler, Acting Director of the Torts Branch, which oversees the vac-cine litigation group. So that I may limit my remarks this after-noon and allow more time for discussion and questions, I requestthat my full written statement be entered into the record. In the face of such traumatic personal tragedies as those de- scribed by members of the preceding panel, Justice Departmentlawyers, along with officials from the Department of Health andHuman Services, face the daunting responsibility of carrying outcongressional intent as we implement the statute and uphold theprovisions of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Act. Each claimunder the program has its own personal story. The cases very often involve complex legal and medical issues, but are always overlaid with heavy emotions. Nevertheless, we en-deavor to exercise our responsibility with the highest degree of pro-fessionalism and with the goal that each case is handled in themost efficient and fair manner possible. To attain this goal, we have been and remain firmly committed to working with the Congress, HHS, the court and other interestedgroups, such as the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccinesand petitioners ' bar to make this program the best that it can be. Indeed there are encouraging examples of positive developments inthe program. Today a greater percentage of families is compensated than in the early years of the program 's existence. In each of the past 5 years between 41 percent and 54 percent almost half of all casesadjudicated have resulted in compensation for claimants. In contrast, from 1991 to 1996, fewer than one-third of the cases adjudicated each year were compensated and the other 70 percentwere dismissed. In addition, we have increased our use of alternative dispute res- olution threefold in just the 2 years alone in an effort to resolvemore cases informally without the need for court hearings. Further-more, one of our attorneys recently organized a working group incoordination with the Office of Special Masters. The working groupincludes Special Masters, claimants ' attorneys, a parent, Justice Department attorneys and HHS staff. This group will reevaluateand revise the guidelines for practice under the Vaccine InjuryCompensation Program with the goal of devising procedures to fur-ther expedite case processing. In particular, the group intends tofocus on the process of settling the damages portion of these cases,which is often shown to be a very time-consuming aspect of pro-gram cases. We do recognize this committee 's oversight responsibilities and indeed appreciate your commitment to ensuring that the programoperates fairly and in accordance with congressional objectives.Again, we are pleased to work with the committee and to assist youin carrying out these responsibilities. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 like to remark on the concerns and issues raised by the witnesses on the panel that preceded me. At the Justice Depart-ment we, too, are concerned by comments from individuals such asthose who testified today that indicate that the program has be-come too adversarial. We are also concerned by examples of casesthat have taken too long to process. Having resolved more than 5,400 cases since the inception of the program, we acknowledge that some cases indeed have not beenprocessed as efficiently as possible. Of course, the most difficult as-pect of each individual case is that it involves a person, usually achild, with serious health conditions. Indeed, many of us at the De-partment are parents ourselves and therefore feel tremendous em-pathy and compassion for each claimant and for their family aswell. We know and appreciate the suffering they endure. Regardless of the cause, childhood disease and injury are always tragic. Regrettably, whether a family receives a prompt compensa-tion or whether the case is dismissed because the injury is foundto be unrelated to vaccine, this program simply cannot reverse thefamily 's tragedy or eliminate the inevitable sadness, pain, or anger they understandably experience. Like all cases filed under the program, the three cases described this afternoon are obviously very difficult to hear about. We under-stand that these claimants are disappointed with the process and,indeed, we regret that their experiences were not more positive. Itis important to hear concerns like the ones that have been ex-pressed today so that we may hope to improve the program whereit is possible to do so. Indeed, I have required our attorneys to ei-ther review the transcript or view a videotape of these proceedings. I trust that the committee also has reached out to hear from fam- ilies and practitioners that are pleased with the program. Certainlyit would be unfair to the public to leave the impression that all,or even most, of the families have had bad experiences with theprogram. I understand that the committee has heard complaintsfrom many individuals that your staff has spoken to. But I alsoknow that there are many satisfied program participants as well. I would like to comment briefly on some of the remarks made from the preceding panel beginning with Ms. Barton 's statement regarding her son Dustin 's case. I understand that Ms. Barton is very disappointed with her experience in the program. In fact, wetoo agree that a case should not take 8 years to process. This is not something I came here to defend. Fortunately, the vast majority of cases are handled in far less time. To be sure, theaverage time for processing newly filed petitions is 2 years.Dustin 's case was exceedingly complex medically and procedurally, which resulted in significant delay. As an example, the medical records did not support Ms. Barton 's initial claims that the vaccine was the cause of Dustin 's injury. This made the case difficult from a factual perspective. From amedical standpoint, Dustin suffered from significant structuralbrain abnormalities which were present before he received his im-munization and were known to cause the type of neurological prob-lems he suffered. This case was also complicated by the fact of Dustin 's unfortu- nate and unexpected death in 1997, therefore changing the situa- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 injury case to a death case. Finally, as the Special Master 's decision acknowledged, ''This case met with agonizing delays. The parties had difficulties in obtaining the required expertreports and critical autopsy materials including slides of the brainneeded for expert analysis. '' All parties would have liked for this case to have been processed more quickly than it was. I can assure you and this committee, Mr.Chairman, however, that there was never any intentional delay orneglect by the Department, nor do I believe that it is appropriateto place blame on any of the parties for the length of time it took. Ms. Barton stated that she was treated unkindly by the Depart- ment attorney who handled her case. We absolutely do not condonedisrespectful treatment of claimants, their families, or any otherprogram participants. We regret that her experience with the pro-gram caused her further anguish. I understand that at the hearing very sensitive personal and medical matters needed to be explored to best understand the like-ly cause of Dustin 's condition. While I cannot discuss these matters in further detail, I can understand that it was difficult for all par-ties to address them. Ms. Barton stated that she was required to agree to have her de- cision designated as unpublished in order that the Governmentagree not to appeal her case. I would like to advise the committeethat in every case the final determination of whether a vaccine inthat case will be published or unpublished rests with the presidingSpecial Master. The Government has occasionally sought petitioner 's agreement to jointly request that a Special Master-designated decision is notpublished with the understanding that the Government would notappeal the decision. Those situations arise when we are concernedthat an erroneous decision may adversely impact the program butdo not believe that further litigation is appropriate given the cir-cumstances of each individual case. In some situations, we determine that the interest of all parties may be best served by our agreement to forgo appeal and furtherlitigation and further delay so long as the decision is not published.That was the situation in this case. Although we disagreed withthe Special Master 's evaluation of the factual and medical evidence and believe that the child 's condition and tragic death were caused by a pariventricular leukomalacia [PVL], a condition he was unfor-tunately born with, we agreed to compensate this case without fur-ther litigation if it would be designated unpublished. Ms. Barton 's attorney then joined us in making that request of the Special Mas-ter. Turning to the case involving Ms. Dyer 's son, Andy, I understand that Ms. Dyer was also happy with her experience under the prob-lem. There were two significant issues that complicated this case.First, the claimants required almost 3 years to submit the nec-essary medical reports and expert report and second, the medical records did not support a finding that Andy suffered a table injury. This case illustrates perhaps the most common reason for case delay, the difficulty in acquiring and producing medical records andan expert report. There were 15 court orders in this case setting VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May Dyers to provide these docu- ments. I can assure the committee that the Department did what it could to contribute to swift processing of this case. For example,our initial report was submitted within the 90-day time period es-tablished by the courts. We filed our expert report just 3 weeksafter the Dyers filed their report, and the hearing was held 1 weeklater. Understandably, Ms. Dyer was disappointed with the outcome of the hearing. Although the Special Master heard the Dyers ' testi- mony, she concluded that the medical records were more persua-sive evidence of the events that occurred at the time of the vaccina-tion. The Special Master was convinced, as the medical records in-dicated, that Andy 's condition began over 3 weeks after his DPT vaccination and, importantly, was unrelated to it. The Special Master 's decision to credit the medical records over the Dyer testimony is based on well-established case law, which ex-plains the principle that, ''oral testimony which is in conflict with the contemporaneous documents is entitled to little evidentiaryweight. '' Of course, one role of the Special Master is to resolve difficult factual discrepancies, such as existed in this case, and therefore itis not unusual for a Special Master to rely upon medical recordswhich were prepared by a physician at the time the events are oc-curring. Finally, I would like to address Jim Holder 's comments about his son Brandon 's case. Like the other children described today, Bran- don too, unfortunately, suffered a seizure disorder. One significantissue affecting the processing of this case was evidencing the medi-cal record of a factor unrelated to the vaccine which might explainBrandon 's seizure disorder. However, after the submission of addi- tional documentation, the government conceded Brandon 's entitle- ment to compensation. The claimants required over a year to sub-mit a life care plan and another 6 months to submit supportingdocumentation. Ultimately, the parties cooperated in negotiatingand agreeing upon a life care plan and the Special Master issueda decision based on this plan. Mr. Holder testified that it took him a long time to find an attor- ney to represent him. We are sympathetic to the difficulty of find-ing an attorney. Oftentimes a family 's experience with the program is the first time they have had to work with a lawyer. To helpeliminate the challenge of finding an attorney, the Court of FederalClaims recently compiled a list of more than 100 attorneys fromaround the country willing to represent vaccine act claimants. Weare also pleased to report that nearly 250 attorneys clearly rep-resent claimants in pending cases. Moreover, the program 's out- reach efforts have increased substantially in recent years. As I stated before, many of the claims under the program often involve complex legal and medical issues, which are compounded by a heavy emotional element. Nevertheless, I can assure this com-mittee that our attorneys endeavor to exercise our responsibility toeach claimant, to the families involved and to the goals of this pro-gram with the highest degree of professionalism, with the ultimate VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May each case is handled in the most efficient and fair manner possible. Mr. Chairman, again I thank you and members of this committee for allowing me this opportunity to appear before you again today,and I want to in closing assure the committee that we hear whatyou're saying about the need to have compassion in this program. It is something that I am certainly driving home with the ones thatwork in the program. It is something that I will certainly sharewith my superiors back at the Department of Justice. Thank you.[The prepared statement of Mr. Harris follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Mr. Harris. Mr. Euler, do you have a comment? Mr. E ULER . I have no opening statement, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Do you think that the results of these settlements in these cases should be published, Mr. Harris? If not,why? Mr. H ARRIS . The unpublished situations occur when there is an issue of whether we are going to appeal or not appeal, and thesedecisions are not sealed, as has been previously described. The ef-fect of an unpublished decision basically relates to a lawyer 's abil- ity to cite a case as a credible reference in future cases. In the caseof the Special Master, unpublished decisions just simply would notappear on Westlaw. That is the effect of having unpublished \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Well, if you settle \u2014\u2014 Mr. H ARRIS [continuing]. Opinions. Mr. B URTON . If you settle a case, like you did in the one we 're referring to, the Barton case, why would you object to having thatpublished? Mr. H ARRIS . The \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Because according to her, Mrs. Barton, the settle- ment was based upon it not being published, and if she insisted onit being published, there would be an appeal. So why shouldn 't that be published? Mr. H ARRIS . We didn 't think the case should be published be- cause we thought that the Special Master 's decision in the case was erroneous. Mr. B URTON . Well, then why did you settle? Mr. H ARRIS . Because we have to weigh competing interests here. We can 't further litigate an appeal on the one hand and drag this case out even more. Mr. B URTON . Had you not lost one appeal on this, in that case? Didn 't you lose an appeal on the Barton case initially? Mr. H ARRIS . The case was we handled, if I recall, correctly. Mr. E ULER . There was a motion for reconsideration in the case, which the Special Master did hear, short of the time, and as shementioned, per opinion that we filed before the appeal period hadcome. So she did reconsider the case and then issued another deci-sion which was published at the time. Mr. B URTON . And that decision was? Mr. E ULER . The decision was to compensate. Mr. B URTON . OK. So the first decision was to compensate, and then there was a second decision to compensate? Mr. E ULER . That 's correct. Mr. B URTON . And then you guys decided, the Justice Depart- ment, to appeal it. But you said rather than appeal it and fight thisout, if you don 't publish this, we 'll settle it. Is that right? Mr. E ULER . Well, we didn 't\u2014we said we think this case \u2014well, we were told by our medical adviser that this case is wrongly de-cided and may have programmatic impact. There is a problem \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Let 's take that one step at a time. It would have a programmatic impact. Mr. E ULER . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . Which means that in layman 's language, if that had been published, it would probably increase the amount of liti- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 kinds of cases, right, and it might adversely affect the program? Mr. E ULER . It might \u2014that's right. We take very seriously the sci- entific integrity of the program. Mr. B URTON . Well, what about the Special Master? The Special Master made the decision it should be compensated not once buttwice, and evidently the Special Master, who has legal standingand who also had all the facts in the case concerning the medicalrecords and everything, I assume they talk to experts, the SpecialMaster talked to some experts before he made her, or she made herdecision. But you talked to a different medical expert that didn 't agree and so you decided not to appeal it because you 're good- hearted? Mr. E ULER . There are competing interests, as Mr. Harris said. On the one hand, you 've got a decision that we think is wrong. On the other hand, we 're trying to expeditiously resolve the case so that there isn 't further litigation and the petitioner gets paid. Mr. G ILMAN . Would the chairman yield? Mr. B URTON . I'll be happy to yield. Mr. G ILMAN . I don 't understand withholding erroneous \u2014what you consider to be erroneous decisions from publication. Is this acommon practice in your department? Mr. E ULER . It is not. From what we can tell, we 've had agree- ments not to publish a case perhaps once or twice a year. Mr. G ILMAN . How many cases have been withheld from publica- tion? Mr. E ULER . We don 't know the answer to that. I suspect it would be 8 or 10. Mr. G ILMAN . And does the Department of Justice approve that kind of withholding of information to the public? Mr. E ULER . First off, it 's not withheld except in the sense that it is not published in Westlaw, but \u2014\u2014 Mr. G ILMAN . That is withholding it from the public, is it not? Mr. E ULER . It cannot be cited. Petitioners are free to circulate the decision. It is not sealed. It is not kept secret. Petitioners canin fact do what they will with the decision. We don 't seal settle- ments. What this is is \u2014\u2014 Mr. G ILMAN . Well, except when you tell them that part of the agreement on settlement is they 're not to publicize the settlement and the basis for it. Mr. E ULER . We do that as a way to try to expedite the case, and we suggest that it 's in both parties ' interest. It 's in our interest not to have the case published. It 's in their interest to be done with the\u2014it's in everybody 's interest to be done with the litigation, and this was a tool to try to resolve the \u2014\u2014 Mr. G ILMAN . And has the Justice Department approved that kind of procedure? Mr. E ULER . Yes. Mr. B URTON . Let me ask you a question. Why was this in Mrs. Block 's interest that not be published? Mr. E ULER . It was in her interest \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Why was it in her interest to not have it published? Mr. E ULER . So that the litigation would not continue, so we can get her the money? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 you said to her \u2014\u2014 Mr. E ULER . I did not. Mr. B URTON . Well, whoever it was said to her, Mrs. Block, we 'll settle with you as long as this isn 't published. That 's correct, right? Mr. E ULER . I think \u2014yes. Mr. B URTON . I think if you talk to the average citizen in this country who was dying and who had to go through this for a longperiod of time, who was suffering from lupus, who was very de-pressed and they said, I 'll tell you what we 'll do, we 'll settle this thing as long as you don 't publish it, I think most people would think that was unseemly by the Federal Government. Mr. H ARRIS . I'd like to comment on that, if I could. Mr. B URTON . Let me just tell you one thing. I 'm going to ask for a GAO audit. I want you to know this, Mr. Harris, and we aregoing to have all of these cases reviewed. And if the GAO can 't do it, we 're going to have to spot check these, as well as the cases of these individuals. So all of this is going to be scrutinized by theGAO. I want you to know that. We 're going to be looking over your shoulder on every case that 's been decided and every one that 's coming up. And you can use all the legal technicalities you wantto on why you do this and why you do that and why you don 't want to have things published, but I want you to know this is not goingto end. It 's not going to end, and you 're going to have Democrats and Republicans, whoever is in charge of the Congress, doing this. And I just don 't understand, you talk about compassion, let me just say a couple words here. The Vaccine Compensation Programwould \u2014and I was in Congress, and I voted for it to help the phar- maceutical companies who are afraid of lawsuits, as well as makingsure that people who had this kind of a problem could get a justcompensation without going through tons and tons of litigation andyears of heartache. So I voted for it. I was here. But the VaccineCompensation Program was intended by us in Congress to be a re-medial compensation program, not litigation, as you continue totalk about. We didn 't intend there to be miles and miles and miles of legal wrongdoing going on and for lawyers at the Justice Depart-ment to be second-guessing and third-guessing a Special Masterwho made a decision. In the Barton case, the Special Master who looked at all of the information, the medical information, who studied this case saidthere should be compensation. Then they looked at it again, be-cause there was some concern with the Justice Department. Againthe Special Master said, a lawyer, a judge in this case, should becompensated. But you went to some other expert and said, oh, no,it shouldn 't be compensated, and you said but we will settle it as long as you don 't publish it. That just isn 't right. Mr. H ARRIS . Mr. Chairman, again, I \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Am I misstating what happened? Mr. H ARRIS . Well, I 'd like to state it in my own words, if I could. Mr. B URTON . Sure. Mr. H ARRIS . But I want to say before I do that, I certainly appre- ciate the frustration and the action that you feel, and clearly thatI understand the frustration and the angst of the families and theprogram participants feel. That is what makes our job at the Jus- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May difficult one, because on the one hand we are re- quired to implement the mandates of the statute. As Mr. Cummings said earlier, there is a requirement in the statute that these claims be based on credible medical scientificevidence. The statute also provides the Justice Department in ap-propriate cases the right to appeal cases that we feel are erro-neously decided. That is in the statute. We 're within the statute in doing that, but \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . I understand. Let me interrupt you for just \u2014\u2014 Mr. H ARRIS . Oh, no. Why we want to cut down on litigation, when we do cut down on litigation by doing things that both cutdown on litigation and don 't hurt the program, is so that we can continue to pursue the important national goals of having kids vac-cinated. Mr. B URTON . Well \u2014\u2014 Mr. H ARRIS . And \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON [continuing]. I understand. I understand. Mr. H ARRIS . I think that 's important. Mr. B URTON . But we 're talking about a specific case here. We 'll get to the other cases as time goes by and maybe later today. In the Barton case, you had a judge, a Special Master, who has legal standing, who was assigned to review the case, all the medi-cal records and everything was looked at. And after a great dealof time and study, it was decided to pay the claim. There was aconcern at the Justice Department about differences of opinion, andso they asked it to be rereviewed. It was rereviewed, and so thenthere was a question about, well, we don 't agree with that, because you are evidently talking to some other medical experts, quote-un-quote. Obviously the Special Master had talked to special experts,not once but twice, to make these decisions, and you decided thatyou would appeal the case, even though this had been dragged onad infinitum. If that isn 't an adversarial type operation, which was never the intent of Congress, I don 't know what it is. How many hoops does a parent like that have to jump through? I just don 't understand it. That was not the intent. Now, the legislation had to be writtenin legalese. We had to set up certain things that had to be done,but we did \u2014it's hard to legislate compassion, and if you get law- yers over there who are looking strictly at getting in front of ajudge or a jury or whoever it happens to be to pound their viewsout, it doesn 't serve the purpose of what we were trying to accom- plish in helping both the pharmaceutical companies and the pa-tients and their families. Mr. H ARRIS . I understand, Mr. Chairman. I think, I really do be- lieve that if our attorneys approach these cases in an incompas-sionate way, that they would have appealed this case. The fact thatthey did not appeal this case on one hand and preserved the integ-rity of the program, as we see it, on the other hand is I think atestament to the way that we try to approach these cases and thedifficult balancing situation that we have to apply in each case. Now, we have had on occasion where appeals have gone forward at the petitioner 's request, and the result not be what the petition- ers expected on appeal. And we do not take these kinds of appealsfrequently. This kind of issue in the published versus unpublished VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May we were talking about occurs about twice a year max, and right now about 200-plus cases that we actually resolve eachyear. So it is not something that happens over and over again, but on occasion we do differ with the Special Master, and the statute pro-vides us the right in those cases to have a different person take alook at the case, and of course there is where the tension comes in.If we decide that we want a different person, the Court of FederalClaims, to take a look at the case in this instance, as you heardfrom Mr. Shoemaker, that would probably result in dragging thecase out another 3 years and on the other hand, saying, OK, whilewe don 't agree with the Special Master on this decision, we 'll com- pensate the victims at this point, as long as we can reach an agree-ment that this decision that we view as erroneous is not publishedand later cited as a legal precedent. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Gilman, do you have some comments? Mr. G ILMAN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I still don 't understand the rationale for an unpublished decision. I don 't know of any other court system in our country that has unpublished decisions. Ourcase law is based on precedents, and you suddenly are removingthat opportunity for the law profession to examine prior decisions,and it seems to me that you 're arbitrarily adopting that kind of a procedure. And I have never heard of this in any other agency. Isthere any other agency that follows unpublished decisions? And ifthat be the case, we certainly want to find out about it. Mr. H ARRIS . Mr. Gilman, there are courts throughout the land that do have unpublished decisions, and the effect is the same,which means that attorneys operating in that jurisdiction cannotrely on the unpublished decisions as precedence when they arepracticing in other cases. Mr. G ILMAN . Well, refer us to at least another agency, a Federal agency that has unpublished decisions. Mr. H ARRIS . Frankly, I don 't study other Federal agencies, but this is according to \u2014\u2014 Mr. G ILMAN . This is the first agency that I 've heard that has un- published decisions. Mr. H ARRIS . Yes, sir. I think it 's important to note again that the fact that there are unpublished opinions and published opinions isan issue that is decided by the courts. I believe that this is a ruleof the courts, and I understand that courts are today looking atthis issue of published versus unpublished opinions and may soonoffer some comment on whether this practice that you 're concerned about ought to continue in the future. Mr. G ILMAN . And the court has not approved your unpublished decision at this point. Is that right? The courts have not put theirstamp of approval on unpublished decisions? Is that what you 're telling us, that the issue is now in contention? Mr. H ARRIS . I'm saying that the courts have put their impression on published versus unpublished opinions, and in fact the ultimatedecision in each of these cases is one that is made by the SpecialMaster. So it 's not the Justice Department that decides unilaterally that this case decision is not going to be published. Mr. G ILMAN . Now, let me follow this. We heard testimony that in settling a case, you told the claimant that you would settle the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May the decision being an unpublished de- cision. Didn 't that come from your Department? Mr. H ARRIS . I think that 's mostly correct, except to say that this is not a settlement issue. It 's an issue of whether we 're going to ap- peal, and the issue really is \u2014\u2014 Mr. G ILMAN . Well, no, I 'm not talking about the appeal now. I 'm talking about your conditionality on the settlement. Mr. H ARRIS . It\u2014\u2014 Mr. G ILMAN . That you would settle a case, providing the claim- ant agreed that this would be an unpublished decision. Mr. H ARRIS . Yes, sir. Mr. G ILMAN . That seems to me to be putting a great deal of pres- sure on the claimant, so that the case law in that case would notbe disclosed to other claimants. Mr. H ARRIS . And I would respectfully try to explain again that this really is not a settlement issue. It 's an issue of whether we 're going to appeal a decision that has already been made. In this casethe Special Master made a decision that went against us that wedid not agree with, we strongly disagreed with. And the issuewas\u2014\u2014 Mr. G ILMAN . And because you disagreed with it, you didn 't want it published. Is that correct? Mr. H ARRIS . Correct, because we felt that decision would inter- fere with and adversely affect the program objectives that Congressset forth, which is \u2014\u2014 Mr. G ILMAN . Does that excuse the agency for not publishing it because you felt that it was erroneous? Mr. H ARRIS . I say again, the agency doesn 't publish any opinions. It's the courts that decide whether an opinion is published or not. Mr. G ILMAN . Right. And if you went to the court for a settlement, eventually that would be disclosed that there 's been a settlement, but the court would disclose that. And yet you 're refraining from allowing the court to publish your decision. Mr. H ARRIS . If we went to settlement and we settled a case, of course the courts would disclose that, unless the file was sealed.The only difference between \u2014\u2014 Mr. G ILMAN . Unless you requested it not be disclosed, which you did in this particular case that we heard earlier today. Mr. H ARRIS . What we in effect asked the court was that this deci- sion not be permitted to be used as precedential value in futurecases because we strongly disagree with it, and we thought that itwould undercut the objectives of the act. Mr. B URTON . Would the gentleman yield just a minute? Mr. G ILMAN . I'd be pleased to, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . As I understand it, you sat down with Mrs. Barton and her family, and you said \u2014your Department \u2014here's what we 'll do. We 'll settle this, but you 've got to sign the document, and the agreement is going to be that you 're not going to request that it be published. That was given to the court, and the court decisionthen was this is a settlement, and it 's not going to be published. Right? Mr. H ARRIS . The court 's decision was that \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . But it was signed \u2014it was agreed to and it was signed by her before it went to the court for the court to ratify it? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 counsel, correct. Mr. B URTON . Right. But the point is, it was a suggestion by the Justice Department to the court in writing that she had signed andagreed to, that it would not be published and that she would geta certain amount of money in the settlement? Mr. H ARRIS . Correct and \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . OK. But the point is this, she didn 't want to do that, but in order to get the settlement, you hand the pen to herand you say, look, if you want the money and you don 't want the appeal, then what we want you to do is we want you to sign thisbecause we 're going to give it to the court and it 's going to be an order of the court saying we 're paying this money and we 're re- questing that it not be published and you agree to that. Mr. H ARRIS . The option that the petitioner had in this case was, one, to jointly agree to petition the Special Master, that the deci-sion be unpublished, the erroneous decision. Mr. B URTON . And she signed it and \u2014\u2014 Mr. H ARRIS . It was jointly \u2014that's correct. Mr. B URTON . It went to the court and it was in the court order. It was in the court order then. Mr. H ARRIS . They just reissued the first \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . But I mean the court agreed to it and that was the court order and \u2014\u2014 Mr. H ARRIS . But \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . But the point Mr. Gilman and I are both making, and I think every Member of Congress would make the same thing,every Democrat or Republican, was that she wanted to get thisthing settled. She was sick, had lupus. Her son had died. This hadgone on for ad infinitum. The Special Master on two occasions saidit should be paid. You didn 't agree with that, and so you said, you sign this agreement and we 'll give you the money, and the agree- ment is that you agree that it 's not going to be published and the court will make the agreement that is in law, that the court agreespasses on. Mr. H ARRIS . I would only alter what the \u2014your statement by say- ing that it was totally \u2014that we actually approached this in a more considerate and compassionate way. Mr. B URTON . Really? Mr. H ARRIS . Yes, and I would like to explain. Mr. B URTON . How many years transpired between the first time the Special Master made a decision and you ended up agreeing tothe settlement? How long a period was that? Mr. H ARRIS . I believe it was \u2014the first \u2014if you would repeat that. Mr. B URTON . The Special Master made a recommendation it would be settled. When was that? What date? Mr. E ULER . That was in February. The final decision was issued in June. Mr. B URTON . So it was about 4 or 5 months? Mr. E ULER . Right. Mr. B URTON . And during that time it had been reviewed a second time by a Special Master and you went and reached an agreement? Mr. H ARRIS . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . She was ill during that time, too. She had gone through 6 or 7 years of all this hell, and then she was told, this VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May it is going to be or we 're going to continue to run this thing on for another year, 2, 3, 4 years or however long it takes, and thatis compassionate? Mr. H ARRIS . Well, I would like to explain, if I could. We 're aware of Mrs. Barton 's condition, and obviously sympathetic to what had happened to her son. Congress charged us to administer this pro-gram and to ensure that compensation under this program is basedon credible scientific evidence. That is the charge that we havefrom Congress. Mr. B URTON . Credible scientific evidence. The Special Master said twice there was credible scientific evidence. Mr. H ARRIS . The same Special Master \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Said twice. Mr. H ARRIS [continuing]. Looked at this, and we wanted a dif- ferent level of appeal to \u2014we wanted to take this to the Court of Federal Claims. So it did \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Well, who in the Justice Department had this medi- cal expertise that thought it should be appealed twice after a sec-ond opinion by the Special Master? Do you have somebody overthere that has both a law and medical degree? Mr. H ARRIS . No. Mr. B URTON . Because the Special Master made a decision. You wanted to rereview it. The Special Master reviewed it again. Afterlooking at all the medical evidence and talking to experts, theymade that decision. And then some lawyer over there said, well, wedon't agree with that, so we 're going to get somebody else in the medical profession to review it. Is that correct? Mr. H ARRIS . No. Mr. B URTON . That 's not what happened? Mr. H ARRIS . No, Mr. Chairman. Actually what happens is when there are issues involving very medically complex situations, aswas the case here, because we don 't have \u2014as lawyers don 't have the medical knowledge to make those kinds of determinations, weconsult with a panel of doctors that have expertise in the area thatare nationally renown and have great credentials, and they areconcerned about the program 's objectives, too, that nothing be done or decisions not be published that would hurt the objectives. That 's to say that this kind of vaccine causes this kind of injury, becausethen folks might have a different view about taking the childrento be vaccinated. Mr. B URTON . Do any of those \u2014\u2014 Mr. H ARRIS . So we get that kind of information and rely on that medical expertise. In rare cases, as I said before, 2 out of maybe200 a year, do we take this step. Mr. G ILMAN . Mr. Chairman, if I might reclaim my time, I 'm not going to be able to return. Mr. Balbier, did you on behalf of HHSgo to this kind of conditional settlement without disclosing the pro-hibited disclosure of the case determination? Did you agree to that? Mr. B ALBIER . Mr. Gilman, my understanding is that a \u2014whether a decision is published or not \u2014\u2014 Mr. G ILMAN . No, I 'm just asking you not what you consider, did you agree in this particular case that this decision would not bepublished? Were you consulted, and did you agree to that? Mr. B ALBIER . Yes, sir. VerDate And was it because you 're trying to protect the agency? Is that why you agreed to it? Mr. B ALBIER . We believed that the Special Master made a mis- take in the decision, and this case had not gone to a judge. Mr. G ILMAN . Did you have any other cases of that nature where you have made that agreement? Mr. B ALBIER . There have been very few cases \u2014\u2014 Mr. G ILMAN . And were there other cases where you made such an agreement? Can you answer that yes or no? Mr. B ALBIER . To be real honest, I honestly don 't remember whether a decision would be published or not coming up as a majorissue in terms of whether we would settle a case or not. This case,as I understand it, was not really settled in the way that we nor-mally think of settlements. This was decided by \u2014\u2014 Mr. G ILMAN . Will you provide to our committee the number of cases where you withheld the decisions for publication? Can youprovide us with that following this hearing? Mr. H ARRIS . I don 't think we can provide that information be- cause all of these decisions are reached typically in informal set-tings, where there is no reporter, it 's off the record. And because it's off the record, it 's not reflected in any \u2014\u2014 Mr. G ILMAN . Well, I 'm sure your Department has some record of these cases, and I 'd like to ask you, with the chairman 's indul- gence, that you provide our committee with the number of caseswhere the decisions were not reported. Can you do that? Mr. H ARRIS . I would be happy to. Mr. G ILMAN . And I have one other question. Mr. B URTON . We have about 7 minutes on the clock. Mr. G ILMAN . Yes. One other question. When you see that there 's a bad lot of vaccines based on the cases coming before you, whatdo you do with regard to that? Do you report that to some agency?Do you try to do something to correct the bad lot? What does yourDepartment do once you find there 's a bad lot claimed? Mr. H ARRIS . We handle the legal issues, and maybe HHS is in a better position to answer questions about that. Mr. G ILMAN . Mr. Balbier, what do you do when there 's a bad lot? Mr. B ALBIER . That comes under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration. Mr. G ILMAN . Oh, you mean once you people find there 's a bad lot, you throw up your hands and say that 's another agency? Mr. B ALBIER . No, sir. No, sir. Mr. G ILMAN . Well, what do you do when you find there 's a bad lot of vaccines? Mr. B ALBIER . We have not found that there is a bad lot of vac- cines. Mr. G ILMAN . We just heard some testimony today about a bad lot, and the case is based on a bad lot. Isn 't that correct, Mr. Har- ris? Mr. H ARRIS . The first I heard of the issue of there being a bad lot of vaccine, clearly this is, to say the least, a very, very seriousissue, and someone with proper jurisdiction should look into wheth-er in fact there are. Mr. B URTON . Well, we have that jurisdiction, and we 're issuing a subpoena this afternoon on that. Let me just \u2014I'm going to \u2014 VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 to have to stay for a little bit because we have some more questions for you. I 'll be back in about 10 minutes, but one of the questions I have to ask, Mr. Balbier, do you have any stockor do you have any financial interest at all in any pharmaceuticalcompanies? Mr. B ALBIER . No, sir. Mr. B URTON . You have Mr. B ALBIER . None. Mr. B URTON . Have you ever had any? Mr. B ALBIER . No, sir. Mr. B URTON . Never had any financial interest in any pharma- ceutical company? Mr. B ALBIER . No. Mr. B URTON . Do any of the people that you know of who are in the decisionmaking process at FDA or HHS own stock or have anyfinancial interest of any type in any pharmaceutical company? Mr. B ALBIER . I can 't answer that question. Mr. B URTON . Have we subpoenaed all of those records from \u2014OK. I want to issue a subpoena for all of the financial records of thetop decisionmakers at HHS, too. OK. We'll be back in just a minute. We stand in recess. I 'll be back in about 10 minutes. [Recess.]Mr. B URTON . I know that you gentlemen have been here a long time, so I 'm going to try to not belabor this. I would like to preface my questions. I just have a series of them for the record, and thenwe'll be finished, but I 'd like to say that there 's a great deal of sus- picion, not just from this Congressman but from others about theconnection between pharmaceutical companies and people who aremaking decisions in the various agencies in government, not nec-essarily the Justice Department, but you in the Justice Departmentare relying upon people in the health agencies for some of the deci-sions that you 're making. Now, the RotaShield virus was a concern. It wasn 't something that was really going to be that fatal, but they came up with a RotaShield vaccine, and as I said before, you prob-ably heard me, the RotaShield vaccine was decided to be put intothe marketplace by an advisory commission. Now, the advisorycommission doesn 't make the final decision. It 's made by the FDA. But the FDA has never, ever, that we can find, turned their backon a decision made by the advisory commission. So in effect, theadvisory commission makes the decision. The head of the advisorycommission that put the RotaShield vaccine on the market, thehead of that advisory commission, was a man who owns stock, alot of stock in the company that made the RotaShield virus \u2014vac- cine, was in the process of doing that. There was a concern raisedabout it and not enough testing but they put it in the marketplaceanyway. And the way they did it \u2014I won 't go into all of the de- tails\u2014in a year some children had died. Many others had been ad- versely impacted and they pulled it off of the market. Now, the reason I bring that subject up is I hope you, Mr. Harris and Mr. Euler, at the Justice Department, will take a hard look atthe connection between people at the health agencies who are in-volved in the decisionmaking process, who may have other reasonsfor taking positions that they do, especially in view of the Victims VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May you 've got people out there who are hav- ing their kids dying or become autistic, or whatever the case maybe, and you find that there 's lots of vaccines, that according to \u2014 who was it? Ms. Dyer \u2014that she found out that was a bad lot, and yet that cannot be made public. Why can 't it be made public? Why was 200 or 300 people adversely impacted by that, other thanmaybe they didn 't want that public, because the pharmaceutical company would have a black eye and it might hurt sales and itmight hurt business? It might keep people from making a lot ofmoney. Now, I 'm a free enterprise advocate, big time, you know, but not where health is concerned. If somebody is covering up or hiding in-formation that may adversely impact the people of this country,then we 've got to do something about it. Now, the Victims Com- pensation Fund that we established was supposed to be a way forpeople to get compensation from vaccine injuries without a lot oflitigation, without any litigation really, but nevertheless we 've got- ten into that. But the other end of it was that we were protecting pharma- ceutical companies from liability suits. They said that they couldn 't produce a lot of vaccines in bulk, because they had so many suitsand they wanted to be protected. So we agreed in Congress that wewould provide a mechanism for them to put money into a fund sothere wouldn 't be a lot of litigation, we 'd protect them and we 'd be able to take care of the public at the same time. It sounded likea winner for everybody. It has helped a lot of people, but it hasn 't been perfect, and I still am suspicious and we have found \u2014I have subpoenaed financial documents from people in the FDA, and wehave found that there are conflicts of interest, that people haveowned stock in pharmaceutical companies who were in decision-making positions. And that is something that I hope you 'll look at, because it 's your responsibility at the Justice Department to make sure these things are handled adequately and right, and we 're going to continue to do that, but I think you really \u2014we may dis- agree, but I think you 're sincere that you want to do the right thing to help make sure people are compensated properly. But if this gentlelady from Tennessee found that there was a bad lot and 200, 300 people were adversely affected by this vaccine, shedid not get compensation. She cannot get information, exceptthrough the Freedom of Information Act, and there is a wholebunch of other information that is being withheld. It needs to belooked at, because if there was a bad lot and all those people wereinjured, they ought to be compensated. You see what I 'm saying? Mr. H ARRIS . Yes. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . I hope you 'll\u2014\u2014 Mr. H ARRIS . And I am very sympathetic to your concern here, and I will take your statements back to my boss, who I 'm sure will handle it appropriately. Mr. B URTON . What I 'd like to do is have Beth here and I, when we get this information, share it with you so that you can be a col-league, if you will, in trying to get to the bottom of this and makesure that everybody is being treated fairly. That would really help. Now, Mr. Euler and Mr. Harris, let me ask you real quickly a few questions. Then I 'll let you go have dinner and me, too. You 've VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May Barton 's testimony. My staff discussed this case with you last week. Have you had a chance to review it? Mr. E ULER . Yes. Mr. B URTON . You have had a chance to review it. I'd like for each of you to tell me if you think the Justice Depart- ment handed that case appropriately. Do you think they did? Andyou know we 've talked about this \u2014or talked about this sometime now. Mr. E ULER . Yes, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it. The case was very, very difficult medically. As I think has been pointed out,there was an alternative condition. Mr. Harris was able to pro-nounce the name of that condition, which essentially means a lossof white matter from the brain. So that was the central thing thatmade the case very difficult. In the words of the Special Master, there were agonizing delays which weren 't particularly anybody 's fault. The petitioner had a difficult time getting records. The petitioner filed several motionsfor summary judgment, for example, and then in the middle of thecase where we had this very difficult condition, which our medicalevidence indicated was the real cause of the condition and it wasnot vaccine related, the child died. And as the Special Masterpointed out, that created a new kind of case. It had to be reviewedfrom that sort of standard, and we moved it along as quickly as wecould. Now, I 'm concerned about what was said concerning the cross-ex- amination that occurred at the hearing. We do not condoneconfrontational cross-examination. Mr. Chairman, I hear you onthat. This program has to have a human face, and I 'd like to kind of, if I could, tell you what I try to do about that, if you have justa moment. Mr. B URTON . Sure. No, no. Mr. E ULER . I know we 're all busy. We start with the interview process. When we interview somebody coming into the program, wesay this is different. Not every lawyer can handle this. This is acase that involves injured people who believe more seriously thatthey have an injury. You may have to ask some hard questions, butyou will treat people with compassion, and you will treat them withcourtesy and you will treat them with respect and empathy, be-cause they are in fact people that have had a tragedy, and then thequestion is, can you do that, can you handle that? So that is where it started. We repeat that all the time in the staff meetings. When we showed the staff a tape of your hearinglast time \u2014that was required for all of them to sit down and see the hearing that we had, I think it was in November, so that theycould see what the issues were, so that they could see what theconcerns were. And then if something is brought to my attention,I look into it. Now, the Barton cross-examination was never brought to my at- tention. It was not reflected in the decisions. The Special Masternever personally brought it to my attention, nor did petitioner 's counsel. If they had, I would have looked into it at the time andI would have taken \u2014and I say that because that 's not what we 're about. Mr. B URTON . OK. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 And that 's what I tell my people. Mr. B URTON . Well, the Special Master, though, to my knowledge never relented on the opinion that he had that this should havebeen a paid case? Mr. E ULER . That 's correct. That 's correct. Mr. B URTON . So\u2014and the one thing that was \u2014I'm sure you re- lied at least in part on recommendations from the health agencyas to whether or not this should be appealed? Mr. E ULER . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . Well, in the future when you look at those cases, I hope you 'll be a little \u2014I don 't mean to be suspicious, but I hope you'll be a little interested in whether or not there is an interest to an outside entity that may be involved. Now, if you find casesthat might set a precedent where a vaccine injury might cause re-percussions out there for an investment, a company that has an in-vestment like a pharmaceutical company, you might look at that atleast with a jaundiced eye before you make a decision, becauseafter all of the hearings we 've had and all of the research that we've done, Beth and others, and I am convinced that in some cases, not in all cases, but in some cases there is outside influence,and it 's very unfortunate because it does have an adverse impact on a lot of people. Now, you heard me read the remarks of the Special Master in that case, the Barton case, and you heard Lori Barton state thatshe felt she was being \u2014well, we 've already answered that. In fact, you've already answered that just now. Mr. Harris, you weren 't around back in 1993. You 're much too young for that. And Mr. Euler, were you supervising this office at that time? Mr. E ULER . I was. Mr. B URTON . Oh, you were? Mr. E ULER . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . And this matter was brought to your attention? Mr. E ULER . It was not until now. Mr. B URTON . OK. Well, that answers that question. Do either of you think that it 's appropriate that the 4 years ex- pired between one hearing and the next? That is an awful longtime. Why did \u2014\u2014 Mr. H ARRIS . That is a long time, Mr. Chairman. I would like to\u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . The child may be \u2014you know, the next condition, succumb to it, I mean \u2014\u2014 Mr. H ARRIS . Right. I agree with and concur with everything that Mr. Euler just stated, but as the representative of the administra-tion, I want to assure you that this administration is absolutelycommitted to making sure that your concerns about a compas-sionate program are addressed. And I wasn 't here when these awful things happened to Mrs. Barton as she alleged during thecourse of her case proceedings, and the Department and the admin-istration regrets that any program participant is ever treated inthat way. And we will be certain to take measures in the futureto ensure that this does not happen, because this is not somethingthat we will tolerate in this administration. Mr. B URTON . When we subpoena this information \u2014and I hope you might do likewise, but if you don 't, I will provide this to you VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May get the documentation. But when we subpoena information regarding the Tennessee case that we heard here today, if we cancorroborate what has been said, I 'd like for you to have that so you can look at that and find out why \u2014if that was a bad lot and there were all those adverse events, why those cases weren 't looked at in a little different light, because it wasn 't just this case. But if there were several hundred, like she alleged \u2014I think you said there were 200 or 300. How many? Mrs. D YER. 246. Mr. B URTON . 246 cases and it was from this same lot, the same lot number. That 's something that should really be looked into, and we're going to subpoena that. And if you could do likewise or if you want to wait and we 'll give it to you, we 'd like for you to take a look at that as well. Now, this is a tough question. Do you have any regrets about the Barton case, them having to choose between the opinion unpub-lished or facing that appeal? Mr. H ARRIS . Well, I 'm glad you raised that issue. The regret that I have is that it caused additional trauma to a family that was al-ready traumatized very, very personally in an unfortunate event.That I 'm very sympathetic with. I would like to clarify this distinction between an unpublished decision versus a public decision. An unpublished decision, first ofall, there are courts throughout the land that frequently issue un-published decisions, district courts in Virginia are courts not ofrecord. There are no opinions on that. Second, the Special Mastersunder this program issue unpublished decisions in most of thecases that they decide on. Mr. B URTON . Well, then why did that question even arise? Why would that even come up? If you thought it might not be published,why would you even say this is conditional upon this being an un-published case? Mr. H ARRIS . Because the Special Master had decided to publish. Mr. B URTON . OK. So the Special Master thought it was relevant for future cases, otherwise he wouldn 't have requested it be pub- lished? Mr. H ARRIS . Correct. Mr. B URTON . And so you 've got to look at this. He had two re- views of it. He thought it should be published, because he wantedit to be a precedent? Mr. H ARRIS . Right. Mr. B URTON . And you guys didn 't agree, and you were concerned about that, and so you made the decision. So once again \u2014\u2014 Mr. H ARRIS . I think if we look at this fairly from both sides and go back to the Dyer case or any case where a Special Master makesa decision that is adverse to the petitioners, certainly we wouldn 't want to foreclose their opportunity to appeal, and I don 't think it 's fair as a matter of justice to foreclose the opportunity for us to ap-peal when we 're not satisfied with the Special Master decision. Mr. B URTON . See, we have a difference of opinion, because this was supposed to be a program with a heart, where people who gota just settlement wouldn 't have any concern, but people who didn 't have a just settlement would have the right to appeal. That didn 't necessarily mean in our opinion, and I don 't think any Congress- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 least the ones I talked to, felt like the Justice Department ought to be fighting what was considered a just decision. So you 're saying, well, it ought to be fair on both sides. I think in most casesthat go before a court you 're right, but in this particular case we 're talking about people who need compassion, and we tried to protectthe pharmaceutical companies as well as to show compassion. Sothe way we thought the compassion should be shown \u2014and I re- member all of these issues vividly when the legislation came up \u2014 was that they would get a just settlement. If there wasn 't a just settlement, there would be an appeal process. But I don 't think we envisioned that the Justice Department would be fighting peoplewanting to \u2014you know, when a decision had been reached. Mr. H ARRIS . I understand that, Mr. Chairman, I really do, and I'm sure that our attorneys understand that as well, which is re- flected in the extreme infrequency with which we petition thecourts to make a decision that they 've already decided should be made published to be unpublished. The effect is that an unpub-lished opinion does not have precedential value. It is available tothe public. Mr. B URTON . No. I understand. Mr. H ARRIS . So if someone wanted to find out what happened in this case \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . No. I understand. Mr. H ARRIS [continuing]. They could walk into the court \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . No. I understand. But a Special Master who was a judge in this case and had reviewed the case twice wanted it tobe a precedent setting case, but you didn 't. And where did you get the information that you used in saying that you might appeal itand that you didn 't want it published? You got that information from the health agencies? Mr. H ARRIS . Not just the health agencies. In part, that is true. We get that from the health agencies, but in all fairness, therewere anywhere from three to six cases, PVL cases prior to this one,where Special Masters had decided that this was not acondition \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Caused by vaccination? Mr. H ARRIS . Correct. And so we have to consider that as well. Mr. B URTON . No. I understand, but I hope you 'll at least in the future, when you get these \u2014if there 's a case that 's decided, let 's say by a Special Master, and it 's reviewed by a Special Master and then somebody at the health agency says, well, you know, we don 't agree with that and you ought to take another look, and they tryto convince you that it should be appealed, look at that real thor-oughly because there may be other reasons why. And Mr. Balbier, I have just two questions for you. Did you have a chance to review the Barton case? Mr. B ALBIER . No, I did not. Mr. B URTON . Who in your agency made the recommendation that the case be appealed? Mr. B ALBIER . We \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Didn 't you make a recommendation or discuss this with the Justice Department people? Mr. B ALBIER . At the time the decision was made by the court, is that\u2014\u2014 VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 no, before the court made the decision, didn 't your agency recommend to the people at the Justice Departmentthat were talking about an appeal, didn 't you make some kind of a recommendation or give them some information about this? Mr. B ALBIER . Yes, sir. The way the process works is that 's the very beginning of the process, is that one of our medical officersthat work with the program reviews the case. Mr. B URTON . After the Special Master made a decision? Mr. B ALBIER . Actually before. What we do is we provide rec- ommendations to the Special Master \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . OK. Mr. B ALBIER [continuing]. For decision. Mr. B URTON . Let 's talk about this case. The Special Master, you gave him information, he reviewed it. He said it should be settled.He reviewed it again, because the Justice Department people saidit should be reviewed. Evidently you had not convinced him. Andhe said, yes, it should still be paid. Then you talked to the \u2014or somebody from your agency talked to the Justice Department and said this should be appealed. Is thatcorrect? Mr. B ALBIER . I do not remember the discussions on that particu- lar case. I \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Can you find out? Can you run the traps on that and get the information for us? Mr. B ALBIER . We can look at our records and go back and \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Yeah. I 'd like to find out what exactly transpired. Mr. B ALBIER . I can tell you \u2014yes. Mr. B URTON . And I understand what you 're saying, at the begin- ning you give a recommendation based upon the information youhave to the Special Master, but in this case he made a decision,maybe you didn 't agree with it. The second time he reviewed it he made the decision you may not agree with. I want to find out ifafter that there was a recommendation made that there be an ap-peal directly to the Justice Department. Mr. H ARRIS . I think I can state for certain that HHS as our cli- ent, that the Justice Department work closely with HHS in the de-cision that you 're concerned about, which is whether to stop the litigation, to forego the trauma and the pain and just to cut thisshort and have an unpublished decision. That was jointly discussedin consultation between Justice Department officials and HHS.And it 's my understanding that officials at HHS rely heavily on medical experts that are familiar, in this case with PVL, when theymake \u2014and I know you 're concerned \u2014when they make this kind of a decision. So if the question was was there a consultation, the an-swer is yes. Mr. B URTON . Medical experts, many of whom serve on advisory committees, who have financial interest in the pharmaceutical com-pany, do they have a tainted view when they make those rec-ommendations? Those are things I hope you 'll look at in the future. We normally don 't do this, but Mrs. Barton, did you have some- thing? Mrs. B ARTON . I just wanted to say that the second hearing on August 7, 1997 was the medical expert hearing, and during thathearing PVL, periventricular leukomalacia, was medical expert and the respondent 's medical expert at that hearing during that entire day with the Special Master there.So that was what the entire day was about, was about the PVL. Mr. B URTON . OK. This was prior to the second decision made by the Special Master? Mrs. B ARTON . Yes. This was \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . And he still \u2014\u2014 Mrs. B ARTON . He was still alive, he was still alive at this point. This was the second hearing. Mr. B URTON . OK. All right. Let me ask one more question. Even acknowledging the fact, Mr. Balbier, that there was some com-plicated issues involved, do you think this case was handled appro-priately from the standpoint of the health agencies? Mr. B ALBIER . Well, again, Mr. Burton, we too would like to see the process made more expeditious, as much as it can be. That 's exactly why we 've proposed legislation to try to do that. So our goal has always been to try to get cases processed through the systemjust as quickly as we can. This case did take a long time. I wishit hadn 't. Mr. B URTON . Well, hopefully we 'll\u2014\u2014 Mr. B ALBIER . We 'd like to get them all handled much faster. It 's a common goal that we all have. Mr. H ARRIS . Mr. Chairman \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Let me \u2014I'm sorry, go ahead. Mr. H ARRIS . If I could take a minute to clarify a couple of things on the record, I would appreciate it. Mr. B URTON . Sure. Mr. H ARRIS . There has been much discussion about published and unpublished decisions in the context of a settlement, and Itried earlier to make clear that what we 're talking about here is not a settlement. It 's a decision on whether to appeal. And I think this is important, because in fact we do settle many cases that areprocessed through our program, and in none of those settlementcases is there any provision that the stipulations in the settlementprovision should not be made public. We never do that, and I justwanted to be absolutely clear about that as a \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . But in this case \u2014\u2014 Mr. H ARRIS [continuing]. A practical matter. Mr. B URTON [continuing]. The Special Master wanted it pub- lished but it was a condition of the settlement, according to Mrs.Barton. She had to sign that document saying that she would notrequest it be published in order for her to get that settlement. Mr. E ULER . That there would not have been a document. Mr. B URTON . That there would not be an appeal. Mr. E ULER . There would have just been an informal arrangement between counsel, and we assumed counsel talked to hercounsel \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . That was not in any document given to the court? Mr. E ULER . That 's correct. Mr. H ARRIS . These are informal. Our attorneys sit down with the petitioner 's attorney off the record in an informal setting. There 's no arm-twisting. Mr. B URTON . So there was nothing given to the judge saying \u2014 that was not requested by the Special \u2014\u2014 VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 May A petition to the Special Master is a joint petition that both parties file with the Special Master. Mr. B URTON . And did that document say that there would not be a request for publishing it? Mr. E ULER . Now, even that would have been by an informal sta- tus conference. In other words, the parties would have got on thetelephone with the court and said we both agree that the opinionshould not be published. I don 't think there 's\u2014\u2014 Mr. H ARRIS . There 's no documentation where we \u2014\u2014 Mr. E ULER . So I just want to be \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . There 's no paper trail to that, but the fact is the Special Master would request that it be published had it not beenfor this agreement? Mr. E ULER . We do appreciate your concern. As I mentioned to your staff, this is an issue we hadn 't been aware of before, and we appreciate the concern. Mr. B URTON . In looking at the level of research evidence on a possible causal connection between an injury and a vaccine, doesHHS consider whether or not research was funded by the vaccinemanufacturer, Mr. Balbier? When you 're looking at the level of re- search evidence on a causal connection between an injury and avaccine, does HHS consider whether or not the research was fund-ed entirely or in part by the vaccine manufacturer? Mr. B ALBIER . Not to my knowledge. We don 't look at actually how the research was funded. Most of the research is actuallyfunded by the Federal Government, including \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . But \u2014\u2014 Mr. B ALBIER . Even CDC. Mr. B URTON . But the vaccine manufacturers have funded a lot of this research? Mr. B ALBIER . Indeed they do. Mr. B URTON . And they work with some of the people over there at HHS quite frequently in trying to solve problems, and theywould have a fairly good relationship many times? Mr. B ALBIER . And research is peer reviewed and it 's subject to the requirements of the journal that it 's published in, and they 're the ones that have responsibility for deciding what gets published,whether they 're\u2014and that sort of thing. We don 't get involved in those decisions certainly. Mr. B URTON . Is it true that the Finnish epidemiological study that the HHS uses to discount laboratory research by Dr. Wake-field that there 's no connection between the MMR vaccine and au- tism was funded by the Merck Laboratories, or do you know theanswer to that? Mr. B ALBIER . Well, I certainly have no special expertise in that area, but I can say that what I understand is that it would be abso-lutely impossible to prove from a scientific standpoint any sort ofa negative assertion; so that 's not something that would even be possible in science to prove that any vaccine cannot and absolutelycannot cause any particular injury. Mr. B URTON . Well, but I think that 's not my question. Maybe I didn't state it. I said is it not true that the Finnish epidemiological study that HHS uses to discount laboratory research by Dr. Wake-field that there is no connection between the MMR vaccine and au- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:34 Merck? Do you guys know if it was funded by Merck? Mr. B ALBIER . I'm not aware, sir. I don 't know. Mr. B URTON . Well, I wish you would look into that if you would and give us an answer because according to the information wehave is that it was funded by Merck through this Finnish epide-miological organization and that HHS is using that study as a rea-son to discount a lot of the assertions made by Dr. Wakefield andif it was funded by a pharmaceutical company that has a financialinterest in discounting what he did, it 's something that you guys ought to take a look at, and we 'd like to know about because that 's the information we have. Let me just end up, I don 't know if the gentlemen from HHS and the Justice Department want to apologize to you, Mrs. Barton, forwhat you had to go through but we certainly will and I 'll leave it up to them. And to you, Mrs. Dyer, please forgive me for forgettingyour name, but we will continue to pursue the information. We willissue that subpoena and we will get the information on that lot,and maybe 1 day there will be vindication for you. We don 't know, but we 'll sure look into it. And with that, thank you very much. I'm sure that you, Mr. Balbier, Mr. Harris, and Mr. Euler will all get to know each other a lot better. Maybe I 'll serve cookies and coffee the next time you come up, but we 'll see you soon. Thank you very much. We stand adjourned. [Whereupon, at 6:15 p.m., the committee was adjourned.][Additional information submitted for the hearing record follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 "}
