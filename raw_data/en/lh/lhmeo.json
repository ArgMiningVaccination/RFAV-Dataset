Someone that astonishes you with their knowledge and beauty. Tanmaya has been one of those rare people to me. I have had the great pleasure to know her for 5 years, first as a repeat client in the body detox program, then as colleague. If you are looking to break through your blockages, reset your health and heal body and mind then I encourage you to allow Tanmaya to be your guide. It is without reservation that I give her my highest praise and fully encourage anyone seeking healing to experience any one of her wonderful workshops or clinics.\" - Suvasa, Switzerland \"I booked the Whole Body Detox as I felt I needed support in taking care of my health and if possible, lowering my weight. The process fulfilled my needs and the support I received from Tanmaya and the other members of the group helped me a lot and I came out with renewed determination to heal my body. Doing it in the comfort of my home was very precious as what I learned about the workings of the body, nutrition, nutrients, and how the cleanse will allow me to keep experimenting with all this. I discovered more about my relationship to my body and some false ideas around this issue. I am ready to renew the experience in order to go even deeper and I feel grateful to Tanmaya and PachaMama for this offering.\" - Yael Yacobovitz - Balva, Isreal \"I had the very unique opportunity to participate in a beautiful journey of body cleanse guided by Tanmaya. Tanmaya is a well-qualified professional with an open heart and a special soul, she made everything so welcoming and clear, inspiring and interesting, with her I was willing to experience new things I wouldn't think I had the courage to do. The process was well held and contained, the group was met almost every night and became a group even by the zoom. We were all over the world and it was exciting. It was meaningful and will stay with me as new habits and as an experience melts into my body and mind.\" - M\u00f3nica Andrade, Colombia \"The Online Detox was profoundly healing for me. It revealed a completely new way in which to relate to my body and take care of myself throughout my daily routines. I was able to finally raise my energy levels, just by understanding how I could really nourish my body and my Soul through diet and food choices. I am grateful for this opportunity, which opened a new door towards optimal health in my life!\" - Karen, Belgium \"Taking the opportunity to go through a full-body detox from home felt like a great gift. It empowered me to recognize that I can manage such a process myself in my own daily life with the support of Tanmaya and an online group. The enthusiasm and wisdom about the topic of food inspired me a lot and knowing that we are all going through the same process made me hold on. I am grateful for the experience and inspiration that can serve me again any time in my daily life!\" - Sandy, Canada \"A wonderful week of motivation and healing from the comfort of home. Tanmaya's presence brought the jungle to us, which was such a blessing for those of us who were unable to be in Costa Rica.
