Ayurveda, which is Sanskrit for \"the knowledge of longevity,\", has thousands of years of documented use - primarily on the Indian subcontinent. Ayurveda is guided by two very basic principles: - That our minds and bodies are connected - That our minds have the ability to not only transform but heal our bodies Simply put, Ayurveda fundamentally believes that your mind, body and spirit must be in a constant state of balance. In modern times, Ayurveda principles, practices (such as diet, meditation and massage) and herbal remedies along with the corresponding use of herbs have been integrated into the western world. In fact, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, officially recognizes Ayurveda as an alternative health system.
