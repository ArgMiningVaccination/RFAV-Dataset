WP Work Plan Contract No: W912DR- xiii 1. INTRODUCTION The Work Plan describes the approach for the Munitions and Explosives of Concern (MEC) Remedial Action (RA) of the Fort Indiantown Gap (FIG) Ricochet Area Munitions Response Site (MRS) (FTIG -003-R-01). The Ricochet Area MRS is located in State Game Lands (SGL) 211 in Dauphin and Lebanon Counties, Pennsylvania. 1.1 AUTHORIZATION Weston Solutions, Inc. (WESTON\u00ae) is performing this work for the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) - Baltimore District (CENAB), under the authority of the Multiple Award Military Munitions Services (MAMMS) Contract W912DR -09-D-0006, Delivery Order (DO) 0009. This Work Plan was prepared in accordance with the U SACE Performance Work Statement (PWS) for, dated 9 January 2013, Revision 01. The Army National Guard (ARNG) is the lead agency for investigating, reporting, making cleanup decisions, and conducting cleanup actions regarding MEC at this MRS with support from Pennsylvania Army National Guard (PAARNG). In addition, technical support will be provided by CENAB. 1.2 PURPOSE AND SCOPE As documented in the Final Record of Decision for the Ricochet Area MRS signed on May 26, 2013 (WESTON, 2013a), an RA is necessary to reduce the risk associated with MEC to human health and the environment based on the current and intended future land use. The remedies chosen to achieve the remedial response for the Ricochet Area MRS include the following: Focused surface and subsurface removal of MEC. Containment and controls. Surface removal of MEC will be conducted in 1,334 acres of the Ricochet Area MRS. Focused subsurface MEC removals will be performed at the Cold Spring and Yellow Spring herbaceous openings located within the Ricochet Area MRS. Containment and controls will include unexploded ordnance (UXO) construction support activities for the timber harvesting activities within the Ricochet Area, specifically the construction of access roads, building of log landings, and other soil -moving activities . The UXO construction support activities are not part of this contract with WESTON. Containment and controls will be addressed under the Land Use Controls Implementation Plan (WESTON, 2013b, in preparation). 1.3 SITE DESCRIPTION 1.3.1 Site Location The Ricochet Area (FTIG -003-R- 01) MRS is located in State Game Lands (SGL) 211, Pennsylvania, which is owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and managed by the Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC). The Ricochet Area MRS lies within East Hanover Township in Dauphin County and Cold Spring Township in Lebanon County ( Figure 1 -1). The MRS area is 3,262 acres ( Figure 1 -2). Contract No: southern boundary of the Ricochet Area MRS abuts the FIG Military Reservation property, located in Annville, Pennsylvania, and follows the ridgeline of Second Mountain. The northern MRS boundary follows the southern facing slope of Sharp Mountain. The east and west boundaries correspond to the area documented as Restricted Airspace R5802A or as Rest ricted Area R5802A in the United States (U.S.) Army Garrison Safety Range Regulation (Army Regulation 385- 1) for FIG (URS, 2008). This regulation describes the area as \"a fall area for spent ordnance which ricochets north of Second Mountain\" (U.S. Army Garrison, 1995). 1.3.2 Historical Information In the early 1800s, the area in and around the MRS was used for coal mining and timber harvesting. In the late 1800s, mining operations declined, and recreational development (e.g., hiking, hunting, camping) increased through the early 1900s. FIG was established in 1931 when the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania purchased approximately 18,000 acres as a military training facility for the PAARNG, with training maneuvers starting in 1933. Historical records indicate that surface danger zones extended from FIG into the current area known as the Ricochet Area MRS. The Cold Spring portion of the MRS (referred to as the Cold Spring herbaceous opening) was also used as a firing point and bivouac area. The Ricochet Area MRS was not in tentionally used as a target area for military activities conducted at FIG's operational range areas. The presence of munitions within the Ricochet Area MRS is the result of unintentional overshots and/or ricochets from the former FIG operational ranges us ed from 1933 to 1998. Current FIG range designs incorporate firing angles that prevent ricochets into SGL 211. FIG remained the Army's responsibility until October 1998 when ARNG took control as part of the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure. FIG then becam e an ARNG and Army Reserve training center. 1.3.3 Munitions and Explosives of Concern Specific UXO present at the Ricochet Area MRS include 75 - and 155- millimeter (mm) high explosive (HE) projectiles and 75mm armor piercing (AP) HE projectile. Other munitions th at may be present are detailed in Section 3.2. 1.4 SITE SETTING 1.4.1 Topography The topography of the Ricochet Area MRS is that of the Valley and Ridge System ( Figure 1 -3). Inspection of a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Topographic Quadrangle Map (USGS, 1981) shows the study area is bounded to the north by Sharp Mountain with ridgeline elevations between 1,500 and 1,580 feet (ft) above mean sea level (amsl). Second Mountain, with ridgeline elevations between 1,200 and 1,400 ft amsl, marks the southern boundary of the MRS. Stony Creek is at an approximate elevation of 700 ft and flows from northeast to southwest in the valley between the two mountains towards the Susquehanna River. Contract No: W912DR- 1.4.2 Climate The average annual temperature in this area is 51.3 degrees Fahrenheit (\u00baF), ra nging from a minimum winter mean temperature of 21 \u00baF, to a maximum summer mean temperature of 83 \u00baF. The average annual precipitation is 42 inches, including an average annual snowfall of 32 inches. Wind speed averages vary from 5.9 to 9.5 miles per hour (mph) from the west and northwest (World Climate, 2009; National Climatic Data Center [NCDC], 2009). 1.4.3 Geological and Soil Conditions The Ricochet Area MRS is located within the Valley and Ridge physiographic province and for the most part underlain by Paleo zoic age sedimentary rocks that have undergone extensive faulting and folding. The ridges within the Ricochet Area MRS are predominantly made up of weather -resistant rocks such as sandstone and conglomerates. The valleys between the ridges consist of the l ess weather -resistant rocks such as limestone and shale. The occurrence of bedrock within the valley is typically 5 to 8 ft below ground surface (bgs) (USGS, 1981). Three major geological formations are present at the site: the Pocono Formation, Mauch Chu nk Formation, and Pottsville Formation. Second Mountain is formed by the Pocono Formation, consisting of conglomerates, massive sandstone, shale, and thin lenticular coal. Underlying Sharp Mountain is the Pottsville Formation that consists of conglomerate and sandstone. The Stony Valley consists of thin sandstone, siltstone, limestone, and red shales of the Mauch Chunk Formation (U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA], 2009). Four major soil associations are present across the Kill. The soil in the area can be summarized as being generally thin and rocky. The soil on the steep slopes of the mountains consists mostly of very stony sandy loams with channery subsoil. The valleys contain alluvial materials \u2014from the well -drained stony sandy loams on the foot slope to shaley silt loams found along the streams (USDA, 2009). Based on the U.S. Department of Commerce weather map, frost lines range from 20 to 25 inches bgs. 1.4.4 Hydrology The Stony Creek watershed is primarily within the Ricochet Area MRS and contains three major tributaries to Stony Creek: Rausch Creek, which is not in the Ricochet Area MRS; Yellow Spring in the center; and Rattling Run on the west side of the MRS. Stony Creek flows from northeast to southwest and drains into the Susquehanna River approximately 10 miles to the west of the western boundary of the Ricochet Area MRS. 1.4.5 Current and Future Site Use The Ricochet Area MRS is located in SGL 211. Curre nt land use includes a number of recreational activities, such as fishing, hunting, hiking, running, bicycle riding, snow shoeing, dog sledding, cross -country skiing, snowmobiling, horseback riding, Fall -Drive -Thru, and bird watching. The Horse -Shoe Trail and Appalachian National Scenic Trail are adjacent to the MRS. Non - Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- 1-3 recreational activities within the MRS include trail, game, and forest maintenance performed by PGC employees or their contractors and organizations associated with the other trails . The PG C plan for current and future land use includes continued recreational use, road construction and maintenance, special wildlife area management, timber management, prescribed burns, and preservation area maintenance. Regular maintenance is performed in her baceous openings maintained for wild game such as turkey and deer. These herbaceous openings are located within the Cold Spring Firing Point area (approximately 7 acres) and an open area (approximately 4 acres) within the central portion of the MRS near Yellow Spring. The areas are prepared for planting by using agricultural tractors, plows, and disking. Intrusive depth for this work is estimated at 1 ft. Timber harvests are also periodically conducted within SGL 211. In general, there is a timber harvest every 4 to 5 years, but the frequency or schedule can vary based on timber conditions. The locations of harvests are selected based on timber surveys/inventories to identify manageable timber and areas where potential habitat improvement projects will be c ompleted. Following the selection of harvestable areas, timber harvests are completed in a multiple -phase process. 1.5 WORK PLAN ORGANIZATI ON This Work Plan was prepared following components of the USACE Data Item Description (DID) WERS -001.01, Work Plans (USACE, 2010a) .

Data will work seamlessly with existing systems and protocols, such as Army MAPPER and Army Repository of Environmental Documents. 3.4 MOBILIZATION This task will include mobilization of field staff; equipment (e.g., computers, detectors, vehicles) and consumable materials (e.g., flagging, stakes, spray paint, personal protective equipment [PPE]); setup, maintenance, and testing of equipment and facilities (e.g., personal data assistants [PDAs], computers, all -terrain vehicles, radios); and familiarizing project personnel with the site and with work and safety requirements. Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- 3-1 The site management staff will provide early notification of activities to PGC SGL 211 Land Supervisor and staff, Dauphin and Lebanon County Emergency Management Agency (EMA), and the local hospital. WESTON will communicate work schedules and subsurface removal action locations with USACE and Fort Indiantown Gap range control daily. The SUXOS will attend the FIG range control morning safety briefing each day. Mobilization will be a phased approach and include: First phase of mobilization - Limited project personnel (i.e., site management) will set up site infrastructure, including office trailer, equipment container, lockable storage containers, supplies, and equipment. Second phase of mobilization - Remaining project personnel (i.e., UXO teams) to begin field operations. First with installation of grid system. Additionally the digital geophysical mapping will take place prior to other major field activities. 3.4.1 Site Office Establishment A temporary office space will be established for this task order along Toms Town Road in the range corridor at FIG. This area will also be used to secure equipment and materials and to provide sanitary facilities and office space for WESTON and USACE pers onnel. Phone and Internet connections will be provided to enhance electronic communications and transmit data. In addition, WESTON personnel will coordinate with SGL 211 management to have a storage container and store project equipment on SGL 211 property if necessary. 3.4.2 Site Utilities The Ricochet Area MRS is located in remote, heavily forested areas of SGL 211. Underground utilities are not present in these areas. 3.4.3 Grid Survey Activities and Removal Action Area Delineation A grid system will be established across the removal action area before munitions response activities are conducted. The grid system will span each surface removal area as well as the Yellow Spring and Cold Spring herbaceous openings. The grid system is used to ensure full coverage is achieved in each removal action area and to provide UXO team navigation and results tracking during the course of the project. The grid layout includes the following three primary steps; (1) establish boundary control points, (2) grid corner location survey, and (3) removal action boundary location survey. Each step is discussed in detail below. 3.4.3.1 Establish Boundary Control Points Boundary control points will be placed to accurately identify the bounds of each removal action area. The boundary control points will also confirm that the surveyed boundary entirely overlaps each removal action area. The overlap will ensure full coverage of the removal action areas. Boundary control points will be at selected removal action area boundary locations. Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- sional surveyor by a UXO Technician II or higher performing anomaly avoidance will establish boundary control points. Horizontal control is referenced to the UTM, North American Datum (NAD) 84, with units of U.S. Survey Feet. The location of each boundary control point is presented in Figure 3 -1. A list of boundary control point coordinates is presented in Table 3 -1. A total of 62 boundary control points will be established. Each boundary control point located by the surveyor will be marked by ins talling a 6 - inch steel spike flush with the ground surface. The steel spike will allow for future relocation. The location of the steel spike will be marked by a wooden stake with fluorescent flagging. The wooden stake will have the unique boundary control point ID (see Table 3 -1). If the pre -planned location of a boundary control point needs to be moved due to vegetation, terrain, or subsurface anomaly, the closest accessible removal action boundary location will be selected and the new location added to the project GIS for tracking. 3.4.3.2 Grid Corner Location Survey The grid system will be used to track progress and results and to ensure complete coverage is achieved during the surface and subsurface removal actions. The grid layout is a continuous 200- ft by 2 00-ft alphanumeric grid system and is shown on Figure 3 -2. A list of grid corner coordinates is presented in Table 3 -2. Grid corners associated with the surface removal areas will be reacquired using a Trimble GeoXH 6000 Global Positioning System (GPS) (or similar). Grid corners associated with the subsurface investigations in the herbaceous openings will be surveyed by a Trimble RTK GPS or equivalent laser total station. Corner locations will be marked using a 6 -inch spike that is detectable during the dig ital geophysical mapping (DGM) surveys. Grid corner positions will be marked with a wooden stake denoted by a unique ID (see Table 3 -2). The grid corner location survey team will be escorted by a UXO Technician II or higher. The grid corner location will then be uploaded to the project GIS. Contract No: W912DR- 3.4.3.3 Removal Action Boundary Location Survey Removal action boundary points will be placed to identify the bounds of each removal action area. Removal action boundary locations associated with the surface removal areas wil l be reacquired using a Trimble GeoXH 6000 Global Positioning System (GPS) (or similar). Removal action boundary locations associated with the subsurface removal areas will be reacquired using a Trimble RTK GPS or an instrument with equivalent accuracy. Removal action boundary locations will be marked with a wooden stake denoted by a unique ID. The removal action boundary survey team will be escorted by a UXO Technician II or higher. The removal action boundary locations will be uploaded to the project GI S. Pre-planned removal action boundary locations will be compared against the measured location in the project GIS to determine offsets. Measured locations will also be evaluated against boundary control points. This assessment will determine whether measu red boundaries completely overlap the removal action area boundaries. If measured boundaries do not overlap with removal action boundaries, removal action boundary locations will be adjusted to ensure that 100% coverage of the removal action area is achieved. 3.4.4 Brush Clearing Brush clearing will be conducted within the investigation areas as necessary to perform surface removal grids and DGM activities. Minimal vegetation will be removed to facilitate the surface removal and geophysical activities. There are no plans to remove any trees; however, no trees larger than 4 inches will be removed unless specifically approved by PGC in accordance with the Special Use Permit (see Section 6.3.1). The goal is to collect the necessary data without significant impact to the surrounding environment. Natural debris (i.e., fallen trees) that will interfere with activities will be cut and moved from the areas to be cleared as necessary. Brush clearing will be conducted immediately following the grid survey activities. A UXO Technician II or hig her will escort the brush clearing crew. All areas designated for brush clearance will be approved by ARNG, PAARNG, and USACE prior to any clearing activities. 3.5 GEOPHYSICAL INVESTIG ATION PLAN The Geophysical Investigation Plan details the operating procedu res and quality control (QC) protocols, as well as identifies the appropriate equipment that will be used for the investigations to be performed during the surface and subsurface removal action activities at the Ricochet Area MRS. Contract No: W912DR- ion DGM and analog instruments will be used at the Ricochet Area MRS during the removal action field activities. Full coverage DGM grid surveys using the Geonics EM61 -MK2 will be performed over 11 acres associated with the Cold Spring and Yellow Spring her baceous openings. Full coverage surface removal over 1,344 acres of the Ricochet Area MRS will be performed using the Schonstedt GA- 52Cx magnetic EM61 -MK2 sensor is a high resolution time -domain metal detecto r system manufactured by Geonics. The system transmits a time -varying electromagnetic pulse in the subsurface capable of detecting, with high spatial resolution, ferrous and non- ferrous objects. The EM61- MK2 is battery -powered, consists of air -cored coinci dent transmitter and receiver coils (1.0 x 0.5 meter coils), and operates at a maximum output of 10,000 milliVolts (mV). The transmitter generates a pulsed magnetic field that induces eddy currents in conductive objects within the subsurface. These current s are proportional to the conductive nature of the material below the instrument. When conductive objects are present below the instrument, the amplitude and decay time of the induced eddy currents vary in response to the size, mass, and orientation of the objects. The receiver measures the amplitude of these eddy currents at 216, 366, 660, and 1260 micro- second intervals during the decay period. A single EM61- MK2 sensor will be hand -pulled on a wheel -mounted cart. A GPS antenna/receiver will be mounted ove r the center of the sensor. The receiver captures the real - time differential corrections from a fixed local base station and outputs a National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) GGA (a code used by NMEA that provides 3D location and accuracy data from the GPS unit) message directly into the Allegro Data Logger \u00ae at one -second intervals. Direct interfacing between the GPS and EM61 -MK2 uses a single clock and streams position information directly into the raw MK2 data file. A sampling frequency will be set at no less than 10Hz, resulting in an average sampling rate of between 3 to 4 measurements per linear foot. Measurements of the four time gates of the bottom coil will be digitally recorded and stored in memory using the Allegro Data Logger. The instrument system will be validated using a test strip, as described in Section 3.5.2.1. 3.5.1.2 Schonstedt GA -52Cx The Schonstedt GA -52Cx magnetic locator is a hand -held unit that detects changes in the Earth's ambient magnetic field caused by ferrous metal. Two fluxgate sensors are mounted a fixed distance apart and aligned in gradiometer configuration to eliminate a response to the Earth's ambient field. The magnetic locators generate an audio output and a meter deflection when either of the two sensors is exposed to a disturbance of the Earth's ambient field associated with a ferrous target and/or the presence of a permanent field associated with a ferrous target. Schonstedt detectors will be used by UXO -qualified personnel for all surface removal operations, the reacquisition of DGM anomalies, and as a screening and avoidance tool. Schonstedt detectors will be checked and tested at the instrument verification strip (IVS) each day they are used. Documentation of these checks will be included in the QC log. A sample log is provided in Appendix D . In the event geology is causing ambient noise issues with Schonstedt magnetic locators, WESTON will use the White's XTL detectors. Contract No: -metals detector is a hand -held, two- coil design metal detector that uses the electromagnetic method to detect ferrous and non -ferrous metals. An audible signal sounds when the sensors are swept over conductive material. The volume and frequency of the signal changes as the sensor pinpoints the center of the source body. The instrument sensitivity can be adjusted to increase or decrease the capability to detect small, metallic materials. The instrument's sensitivity will be adjusted as needed to achieve the IVS requirements. 3.5.1.4 Navigation and Positioning Systems Several types of navigation and positioning systems will be used by the project team during the RA. The systems include: Trimble RTK GPS - Increases the accuracy of GPS readings by using a stationary receiver that sends real -time correct ions to the rover (EM61- MK2 full coverage surveys). The RTK -GPS will be used to place grid corner locations and removal action boundary locations associated with subsurface removal areas. The RTK -GPS will also be used for anomaly reacquisition and to plac e IVS and grid seed items. Trimble Robotic Total Station - Used in the event that RTK GPS coverage is inadequate due to canopy cover. Trimble GeoXH 6000 GPS (or similar) - Capable of sub- meter accuracy and will be used for locating grid corner positions and removal action boundary locations associated with surface removal areas. The Trimble GeoXH 6000 GPS will also be used during surface removal activities to capture positions of MEC items discovered. 3.5.1.4.1 Local Navigation Methodology (Line and Fiducial) Line a nd fiducial DGM surveying (using the Cartesian X, Y grid system) may be required in areas of inadequate GPS coverage along the boundaries/wood line around the herbaceous openings. Geo- referencing the geophysical data will be accomplished using the information recorded in a field log/notebook (e.g., start and end of line stations, lane spacing, and fiducial mark intervals) and the information digitally recorded in each geophysical survey data file. An example of line and fiducial navigation is presented in F igure 3 -3. The procedure for collecting geophysical data using the line and fiducial method will include the following: The geodetic coordinates of the grid corners will be used to geo- reference the geophysical data after data collection. The surveyor's ta pes (or graduated static ropes) will be laid out in an east -west or north- south direction as the terrain allows, establishing the baselines. Typically, the southwestern corner of the grid surveyed is assigned a relative coordinate of 0E, 0N. Ropes will th en be laid out between the base lines to establish survey lanes and will provide the geophysical operator with a navigation aid, allowing him or her to Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- 3-6 traverse the line in a linear manner. This setup will allow the geophysical operator to maintain full co verage (no data gaps). Fiducial data markers will be inserted by the operator at intervals not to exceed 20 ft. These markers will be used to accurately locate each data measurement point during the post- processing stages. A 20 -ft fiducial spacing will be used in grids that have an open to moderately level terrain. The Site Geophysicist will dictate a smaller fiducial interval to account for the varying terrain. This decision will be made on- site based on the field conditions and following grid placement. The geodetic coordinates of the grid corners will be used to transform or \"warp\" the Cartesian coordinates and the associated geophysical data to the UTM coordinates in the post -processing step. 3.5.2 Geophysical System Verification The geophysical system verification (GSV) approach will be used to monitor and verify analog and DGM equipment functionality during the geophysical mapping activities. The GSV approach uses an IVS and is a USACE -accepted alternative to the traditional Geophysical Prove -Out (GPO) . The GSV approach capitalizes on the known performance of the geophysical sensors (Naval Research Laboratory [NRL], 2009). It provides the advantage of reallocating resources traditionally devoted to a GPO to support a simplified, yet more rigorous, verification method for geophysical system operations. In addition, it incorporates a blind seeding program to continually monitor production mapping work within the MRS. A description of the blind seeding program is provided in Section 3.5.2.2.The IVS will also be used to test analog instrumentation (Schonstedts). 3.5.2.1 Instrument Verification Strip for EM61- MK2 and Schonstedts The objective of the IVS is to provide a means to verify that the geophysical detection system is operating properly. The IVS will be used to test both the digital and analog equipment. Applicable Instrumentation: The IVS will be used to evaluate the Geonics EM61-MK2, the Schonstedt GA-52Cx, RTK-GPS positioning, and instrument operators performing DGM and analog surveys. The seed items placed w ithin the IVS should be observed in the geophysical data with a signal consistent with the physics -based sensor response curves developed for the EM61- MK2. Location of the IVS: The IVS will be established in an area that is near the project site and equipment storage location and that has been checked and identified as relatively clear of major anomalies. If an area free of anomalies that may interfere with the IVS cannot be found, then digging and removal of the anomaly source may be required. The specifi c location of the IVS will be determined at the start of field operations. The area will be large enough to accommodate the IVS design and procedures and will be consistent with the geophysical conditions of the MRS. If logistics require, more than one IVS may be established. Contract No: W912DR- background survey will be performed using an EM61- MK2 at the proposed IVS location. The results from the background survey will determine the suitability of the site and assist the Site Geophysicist in the placement of the seed items. Seeds will not be placed near existing anomalies. Ambient site noise will be measured and evaluated against sensor response curves to determine the detection depths of the items of interest anticipated for the MRS. Seed Item Placemen t: Following the pre- seed survey, the IVS will be linearly seeded with three medium industry standard objects (ISOs), one small ISO (schedule 80), and one inert item such as a 75mm. The ISO descriptions are listed in Table 3 -3. The seeds will be placed in the IVS and separated by at least 10 ft to prevent overlapping signals. The ISOs will be placed at horizontal orientations. The one small ISO will be placed 5.3 inches bgs. The inert 75mm and three medium ISOs will be placed 12.0 inches bgs. In addition, one large survey nail will be placed at the end of the IVS and buried vertically. Final placement will be at the discretion of the Site Geophysicist and the USACE Quality Assurance (QA) Geophysicist. Figure 3 -4 shows a diagram of the proposed IVS. Seed locations will be surveyed using the RTK GPS or equivalent. The item parameters (i.e., the surveyed location, depth, and orientation) will be recorded and entered into the project database. The start and end points of the IVS will be marked at the surface with wood stakes and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) flags. All IVS seeds will be marked with PVC flags to ensure that the operator traverses directly over the seeds. Test Strip Procedures - DGM: A DGM survey will be performed over the IVS using the EM61- MK2. This pr ocess will be performed twice daily before and after production surveying. The data collected will then be evaluated to determine a seed item response and positioning baseline to compare against production surveys. Response values will also be monitored against the instrument response curves for the ISOs. Test Strip Procedures - Analog: Each UXO technician will traverse the IVS daily prior to starting survey work and at the completion of the work day to verify proper sensor operation. Mid- day tests will be conducted by placing one small ISO on the ground surface. The mid- day test will be used to verify proper sensor operation. If interference is suspected during certain times of the day, or instrument signals and operators notice any type of discrepancy, the n the test strip should be immediately revisited to evaluate operation. The operators will tune the instruments to ensure detection of all seed items. The instruments will be swept side to side while the operator traverses over the seeded line. The SUXOS, UXOQCS, Site Geophysicist, or a designated representative will ensure that each operator clearly verifies proper sensor operation by detecting all items in the strip. Results of each test will be documented by user name and instrument identification. Appendix D provides the analog instrument checkout list, which will be used to document each operator's name, instrument identification, and test strip verification on a daily basis. The checkout list will be maintained in the project file located on -site, and reviewed daily by the UXOQCS to evaluate equipment and operator performance. Contract No: W912DR- The initial results of the IVS will be discussed between the WESTON Project and Site Geophysicist and the USACE QA Geophysicist. The peak responses from the IVS seed items will be plotted against their respective instrument response curves. The blind seed items will also be monitored for positional accuracy and response and compared to the IVS results. All seed item responses should plot higher than the calculated resp onse curve for the least favorable orientation response curve. The average noise values across the unseeded test strip and the geophysical grids will be calculated and monitored during the life of the project. The GSV results will be included for the digit al geophysical data packages. The IVS results will include the following: As-built drawings of the IVS, including depth and orientation of seeded items. Representative photographs of the surrogate ISO seed items (initial results). Color plots of the DGM da ta. Instrument response curves. Seed target list showing comprehensive results. 3.5.2.2 Blind Seed Item Procedures The objective of the blind seeding program will be to provide ongoing monitoring of the quality of the geophysical data collection and the target selection process related to the production survey for the Ricochet Area MRS. DGM survey areas within the herbaceous openings will contain an ISO seed item similar to the items used within the IVS at a frequency of 10% of the surveyed acreage or at least o ne ISO per dataset. The seed locations will be surveyed with RTK GPS or equivalent by the UXOQCS and a UXO technician prior to field work in the area and will be blind to the data collection teams. The depths for seeds should be such that the seed items are easily detectable, approximately 6 inches below ground surface. The location of each seed item will be marked and recorded with RespondFast -UXO Investigation (RespondFast \u00ae) data collection tool, and will be reported along with all other data collected at the end of the field event. After each dataset is collected, the Project Geophysicist will overlay the locations of the blind seeds on the processed data and verify that the detection and navigation data quality objectives (DQOs) are met in the dataset. T he response of each ISO will be compared in relation to the IVS results and the instrument response curves. For analog survey areas, a small ISO will be placed on the ground surface at a rate of one seed per day or one per 3 acres. The seed locations will be surveyed with a Trimble GeoXH 6000 GPS or equivalent (sub- meter accuracy) by the UXOQCS prior to field work in the area and will be blind to the UXO teams. The location of each seed item will be marked and recorded with RespondFast \u00ae, and will be report ed along with other data collected at the end of the field event. 3.5.3 Site Utilities There are no known utilities within the SGL 211. The Pennsylvania One Call Center for public utility notification will be contacted and appropriate procedures will be followed. Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- Manmade Features Potentially Affecting Geophysical Operations Remnants of historic structures with cultural significance are within the Ricochet Area MRS and include: Bed of former Schuylkill and Susquehanna Railroad that parallels Stony Creek. Abandoned shafts associated with coal mining, which occurred during the 1880s; however, these areas are predominantly outside the surface removal areas. Old trails associated with historic lumber operations. Building foundations associated with the historic Cold Spring Resort. With the exception of potential remnant metal (i.e., railroad spikes, tie plates, rail sections) in the old railroad bed, these features are not expected to impact the instrumentation. 3.5.5 Overall Site Accessibility and Impediments The Ricochet Ar ea MRS is located in a remote area with limited access points and is situated between two mountains: Sharp Mountain to the north and Second Mountain to the south. Cold Spring Road provides access to the Ricochet Area MRS from FIG to the south. Hotel Road i s located on the ridge of Second Mountain and will provide access to most of the RA areas. One seasonal road (Old Railroad Grade) runs east to west the entire length of the Ricochet Area MRS and will provide access to the Yellow Spring herbaceous area and analog RA areas. The site is heavily forested with old growth trees and contains several streams and impediments such as steep and rocky areas, dead fall, and wetlands. 3.5.6 Measurement Quality Objectives The geophysical performance criteria provided in Tables 3-4 and 3-5 are based on the most recent version of Performance Requirements for RA Using DGM and Analog Methods (USACE, 2010b). The geophysical quality measurement criteria establish the specific metrics concerning the sensor performance, navigation accuracy, data density, data processing standard, and anomaly selection criteria to meet the minimum goals for the investigation. The metrics will be confirmed or appropriately adjusted based on the Technical Project Planning (TPP) process and the results of the IVS. 3.5.7 Instrument Standardization To verify the instrument accuracy, digital geophysical survey instrumentation will be checked at the beginning and end of each workday based on the tests and frequencies identified in Table 3-6. Dynamic data will be collected over th e IVS daily. Additional function checks may be performed throughout the day, as the operator deems necessary. The data from each system test will be compared with the data collected on previous days. If there is a significant change in the results, the instrument will be rechecked. If the Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- 3-10 difference in the data cannot be accounted for, the instrument will be taken out of service until repaired. 3.5.7.1 Instrument Function Checks Prior to conducting the QC function tests, spot measurements will be taken at various locations around the proposed DGM survey area to identify the most suitable area to establish a QC station. The IVS, static background, static spike, and cable connection tests will be performed daily before and after surveying at the fixed QC station identified from the spot measurements. The QC test statistics will be entered and saved to a database, which will be electronically submitted with each data package. Static Background Test: Performed twice daily to record background response at the \"QC Stand\" to determine whether drift, interference, or equipment malfunction was occurring during the day. Instrument functionality and ambient electromagnetic (EM) cultural noise are the likely sources of non- repeatable readings. Static Spike Test: Performed twice daily to record instrument response over a conductive spike item of appropriate size. The static spike test demonstrates the sensor's sensitivity to a chosen test object, quantifies the instrument response, and documents its ability to collect stable readings. Cable Connection Test: Performed twice daily to test all cable connections. The cable connection test is used to identify mechanical and electrical problems with the EM61 -MK2 instrumentation. Large anomalous spikes within the test da ta indicate poor connectivity between the cables and the field data logger. IVS: The IVS is used to demonstrate the EM61- MK2 instrumentation repeatability and accuracy, and to determine latency. The peak response from the IVS seed items will be plotted aga inst their respective instrument response curves. Seed item responses should plot at or above the least favorable orientation response curve. 3.5.7.2 Corrective Measures One of the main goals throughout the RA will be to achieve and maintain a high standard of dat a quality. This will be accomplished by a vigilant compilation of QC checks and QA reviews on data collection and processing procedures. Any deficiencies identified will require a corrective measure, and a root -cause analysis will be performed to document the issue, analysis, and corrective action. Such root- cause analyses will be submitted to USACE as memorandums. 3.5.8 Records Management The data related to the DGM surveys will be managed using Geosoft Oasis montaj software. Spatial data will be managed using GIS, and will be stored in Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) -compatible GIS file formats, primarily ArcInfo coverages and files. Contract No: The data will be stored in site -specific folders that indicate the individual field efforts, data t ype, and file extension. The DGM data will be submitted in accordance with DID WERS -004.01 (USACE, 2010c). The data will be provided electronically to the USACE QA Geophysicist on compact disc or via the WESTON TeamLink Website and will be backed up on WES TON's internal network and project workstation. 3.5.9 Digital Data Processing 3.5.9.1 Data Storage and Preliminary Processing The digital geophysical data will be downloaded directly from the data -logger to a work station for processing. Sensor manufacturer software (Na vMaker61 and Geonics DAT61) will be used to pre -process, review, and edit the data as necessary; normalize the data to the fiducial control marks; generate profile lines; and convert the DGM data to ( x,y) coordinates for contouring, map generation, and interpretation. 3.5.9.2 Standard Data Analysis The geophysical teams will provide the raw digital data, digital records, and field notes to the Project Geophysicist after the completion of the day's field activities. The digital data will be submitted in an ASCII -delimited file (XYZ) suitable for input into the Geosoft analysis software. The field crews will initially process the data to correct the file names, line numbers, survey direction, start and end line locations, and grid identification. Data spikes artificially induced from cultural interference unrelated to subsurface material will be documented and removed where appropriate. The pre - and post -survey QC data will be reviewed real -time and during the data download to identify any abnormal readings. 3.5.9.3 Advanced Data Processing, Corrections, Digital Filtering and Enhancement Once the initial data processing procedures are complete, Geosoft 's UX -Detect and QC Geophysical Mapping modules will be used to further reduce the data. The following data processes will be performed where appropriate: Instrument Latency: Instrument latency will be corrected based on the lags or time differences observed in anomaly peak positions from the IVS test. Corrections will be applied using an appropriate correction routine that accounts for instrument latency time and sensor velocity. Chevron effects should not be visible in the data maps when plotted at the scales used to detect the smallest amplitude signal for a given MEC/materials potentially presenting an explosive hazard (MPPEH) item. Instrument Drift Correction: A drift correction process will be applied to the EM61- MK2 geophysical data to remove any unwanted signal indicative of instrument drift. In addition to the standard geophysical data processing procedures, the following s tatistics will be calculated for each dataset to ensure that the data collection is meeting measurement quality objectives (MQOs). Contract No: W912DR- Background Noise: The standard deviation will be calculated in areas free of anomalous responses to identify the background noise levels. Along -Track Sampling: The along -track sampling will be evaluated with respect to the mean speed. For the EM61 -MK2, the average along- track sampling will not exceed 0.6 ft between the data points. It is anticipated that the along -track samplin g will average approximately 0.35 ft based on the sampling frequency. Across -Track Sampling: The across -track sampling for the EM61 -MK2 grid survey will not exceed 2.0 ft. Minor data gaps may occur if obstructions exist in the DGM grid. The data gaps due to obstructions will be excluded from this metric; however, data gaps will be cumulatively tracked. 3.5.9.4 Preliminary Anomaly Selection Criteria The Project Geophysicist will use the UX -Detect Blakely Test to perform preliminary anomaly selection from DGM data. The target picks will be compiled into a dig sheet through an anomaly selection process. The Geosoft Oasis montaj UX -Detect software will be used as the DGM processing platform. The anomaly selection process will involve the following steps: Initial targ et selection - An initial cut- off threshold value will be established based on the IVS results. The cut -off threshold value will be determined by evaluating instrument response curves and noise. Targets will include all signals above 5 to 7 times the root mean square (RMS) noise. The WESTON and USACE Geophysicists will evaluate the feasibility of an increase or decrease to the threshold value based upon preliminary field results. Perform a manual review of all targets for validity: Perform manual review of decay profiles for all four channels at all suspect and/or low amplitude anomalies. Remove anomalies not exhibiting response characteristics of buried metallic objects from the target list. This process may be performed using a scripted routine that will find the nearest peak and compare the values for all associated channels in order to compute, identify, and flag negative time constraints. Dummy out known operator and equipment- induced targets. Select appropriate targets. Conduct a manual review of remaining data to center the anomaly response as needed. Add additional QA picks at/or below cut-off threshold. Contract Finalize preliminary target selection after QC check by the Project Geophysicist, create and format database, and generate preliminary target plo t to run classification scheme. All corrected geophysical data and anomaly locations will be exported to a database. Throughout the geophysical survey, the field personnel will use logbooks to record observations such as variances in the background interference/noise when collecting data, and/or note changes in the soil characteristics. Such observations will provide valuable insights during the selection of anomalies in the areas where significant variations in background interference/noise exist. The DGM coverage maps and anomaly results will be presented to the project team, including USACE for review. 3.5.9.5 Dig Sheet Development Following the identification of the potential target anomalies from the geophysical data evaluation listed above, the anomaly locations will be digitized based on the position of the target in UTM Zone 18 NAD coordinates in U.S. Survey Feet on Target Dig Sheets (Appendix D). The Project Geophysicist will assign each anomaly a unique target identifier and will enter the corresponding information for the target into the database. The Dig Sheets will also include the QC target anomalies. At a minimum, the following information will be included in the database for each target anomaly: Unique Target ID and grid/transect ID (e.g., CS -G04-01, {Cold Spring -grid ID -target number}). Unique Polygon ID for the potential discarded military munitions (DMM) burial areas. Easting and northing position. Channel ID. Response amplitude of the peak response. Dig lists will be generated for all anomalies, including any burial pits that may have been identified from EM61- MK2 surveys at Cold Spring or Yellow Spring. Each polygon will have a unique ID that can be input to the target list consistent with the individual anomalies. The GPS waypoints for polygon anom alies will be presented in a separate table. 3.5.9.6 Anomaly Reacquisition and Marking Anomaly reacquisition will be performed once the geophysical and location data are processed. The selected targets will be located in the field using an RTK GPS or the Trimble R obotic Total Station. The geophysical target location will be marked with a non- metallic pin flag with the unique anomaly ID. Potential burial pits will be marked with non- metallic pin flags with GPS waypoint information and placed along the perimeter of t he potential pit. A UXO technician will refine the location prior to excavation using the peak response detected by the handheld all - metals detector. Offsets between the reacquired location and the excavated location will be Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- 3-14 entered into the database. In t he event that the Schonstedt is unable to resolve the DGM anomaly location, the EM61- MK2 may be used in this situation. 3.5.9.7 Anomaly Excavation and Reporting The project team lead will maintain records of all material recovered on the project. These records wil l be kept using the RespondFast electronic data entry program on a hand- held PDA. The data entered into the PDA will be transferred to a computer and project database each day and subsequently loaded into the project GIS so that all anomaly information is contained in the project GIS. 3.5.9.8 Feedback Process The Senior Geophysicist or his designee will review the RespondFast database to assess whether the physical characteristics of the item(s) found are consistent or appropriate relative to the size and amplitude of the detected geophysical anomaly. If it is determined that the item was likely not the entire source of the anomaly, the anomaly location will be reinvestigated using the same instrument as during the initial survey. Anomalies of this type will be tracked separately in the database in the event that future analysis is required. In addition, the information derived from the feedback process of comparing the dig results to the predicted results will be continually evaluated to identify the improvements that can be incorporated into the anomaly selection process. The measured response values will be compared only with the excavated item characteristics. The UXO team will confirm that a reduction in signal exists with the hand -held instrumentation used during the anomaly investigation. 3.6 GEOSPATIAL INFORMATI ON AND ELECTRONIC SUBMITTALS WESTON will be performing location survey activities at the Ricochet Area MRS. All boundary control points will be provided by a contracted Pennsylvania -licensed surveyor. The RTK GPS will be used to mark the location of each of the survey grid corners intended for DGM in herbaceous openings. The Trimble GeoXH 6000 GPS, or equivalent, will be used to locate grid corners in the surface removal areas. The Ricochet Area MRS will have a numeric grid system (see Figure 3 -2) that will be established in GIS to provide control and reference for mapping and excavation activities. If large cultural features are observed in a grid location, the location of the features will be recorded. Data related to the DGM and analog surveys will be managed in WESTON's central database, RespondFast. Spatial data will be managed using GIS, and will be stored in ESRI -compatible GIS file formats, primarily ArcInfo coverages and ArcView shape files. The da ta will be stored in site -specific folders that indicate the individual field efforts, data type, and file extension. All data will be referenced to the UTM Zone 18 projection, NAD 84 datum, with units of U.S. Survey Feet. 3.6.1 Geographic Information System Incorporation MEC surface and subsurface removal action results will be referenced to the geographic coordinates and grid where the item was recovered. File names for the electromagnetic data will be referenced to the grid in which the data were collected. M RS information will be logged using Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- - UXO Investigation field data software for seamless integration into a GIS database. 3.6.2 Plotting The X/Y locations and the descriptions of all MEC, MPPEH, munitions debris (MD), discarded military munitions (DMM), and non- MD items identified during the course of the RA will be recorded electronically on a field computer. All locations will be compiled, tracked, and plotted in a GIS database. In addition to the MEC, MPPEH locations, grid corners, and ina ccessible areas will be stored in the GIS database. Maps will be generated on a weekly basis to track results. The information overlaid on the base maps will include, at a minimum, a point referencing the location of the MEC or MPPEH and the grid ID. Because of the extensive number of points anticipated, all other data (such as northing, easting, anomaly ID, anomaly description, depth) will be recorded in the Dig Sheet ( Appendix D ) and stored in a database for retrieval at a later date. 3.6.3 Mapping The GIS data are being stored and managed using ESRI ArcGIS software, and are spatially referenced to the UTM Zone 18 projection, NAD 84, and U.S. Survey Feet units . Metadata are created for all GIS layers managed by WESTON on this project, and conform to Federal Geographic Data Committee metadata standards. 3.6.4 Electronic Submittal At the close of the project, the DGM data will be submitted in accordance to DID WERS -004.01 (USACE, 2010c). The GIS data will be submitted in non- proprietary Spatial Data Transfer Standard format, as well as in the proprietary format used for the execution of the project, specifically AutoCAD 2000 and ESRI ArcGIS geodatabases. The final DGM data will be submitted in accordance with DID WERS -004.01 (USACE, 2010c) in electronic format on digital video disk. The daily or weekly submittals will be performed via the TeamLink project website. The pertinent in -progress and field GIS data, design drawings, survey data, relational databases, and other related data will be made available online to the government on the project's TeamLink website. The formal GIS data submittals will be made on PC -compat ible compact disk. Each submittal will be accompanied by a freeware viewer application appropriate for reviewing the proprietary formatted GIS data (e.g., ArcExplorer for ESRI format geodatabases). Instructions will be included with each submittal for load ing the data and the viewer application. No other additional software is required, and no data modification is required for viewing the submittal. 3.7 SURFACE AND SUBSURFA CE REMOVAL OPERATION S 3.7.1 Accountability and Records Management for Munitions and Explosives of Concern WESTON will maintain records of all items recovered on the project. These records will be kept using an electronic data entry program on a hand -held PDA. The software program is WESTON's RespondFast - UXO Investigation, which has modules subsurface Contract No: 3-16 recoveries. Data kept are in accordance with the data requirements specified in DID WERS - 004.01 (USACE, 2010c). Data entered into the PDA will be transferred to a computer and the project database each day and subsequently loaded into t he project GIS so that all anomaly information is contained in the project GIS. 3.7.2 UXO Personnel Qualifications Roles and responsibilities of key personnel are provided in Table 2 -1. All UXO personnel will meet or exceed the requirements of DDESB TP 18, Minim um Qualifications for Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) Technicians and Personnel (DDESB, 2004), for their respective project function. The UXOSO/QCS will review and approve all UXO personnel resumes and certifications prior to performing work. 3.7.3 Removal Action Are a Description Surface removal of MEC will be conducted only in a focused area limited to the portions of the MRS with MEC/MD densities greater than 0.5 surface items per acre ( Figure 3 -5). This area is estimated to be 1,334 acres of the Ricochet Area MRS. In addition, all trails running through the MRS will have a surface removal completed. A focused subsurface MEC removal to detection depth will be performed at the herbaceous openings located within the Ricochet Area MRS (see Figure 3 -6). The subsurface removal area is estimated to be 11 acres. 3.7.4 Removal Action Procedures 3.7.4.1 Surface Removal Action Procedures Focused surface removal of MEC includes removal of MEC detected at ground surface either fully exposed or partially exposed using analog detection instruments like the Schonstedt magnetometer that uses flux -gate technology. Leaf litter and detritus will be removed down to the ground surface to investigate anomalies detected. If a detected anomaly is not exposed or partially exposed after moving leaf litter a nd detritus down to ground surface, investigation of the detected anomaly will cease and UXO personnel will continue with surface removal activities. A 6-man or 7 -man UXO team, led by a UXO Technician III, will methodically clear each grid using a method that will provide an overlap of individual lanes. The team members will sweep the grid and mark their progress to ensure there is overlap. The team leader will ensure that 100% coverage is achieved. Upon detection of an anomaly as evidenced by an audible s ignal and visual confirmation of either a fully or partially exposed item, the UXO technician will investigate the anomaly. It is anticipated that minimal brush clearing will be required to facilitate surface removal activities. Based on WESTON's experience at the MRS, equipment operators will be able to extend their metal detectors under and around trees and brush to achieve full coverage surveys. This method has been deemed acceptable on previous removal actions at the Tobyhanna Artillery Range Formerly U sed Defense Site. If necessary, UXO technicians will thin areas of dense vegetation using hand tools to gain access. Natural debris (e.g., fallen trees) that prohibit the detection of surface material will be cut and moved as necessary to gain access. Sens itive Contract No: W912DR- 3-17 habitat and cultural features or obstructions that are observed during the operations will be logged by the UXO teams and presented on the grid maps. The grid layout is a continuous 200- ft by 200- ft numeric grid system with wooden stakes installed at grid corners. The grid boundaries will be established prior to performing surface removal activities. Surface removal surveys will be performed using a Schonstedt GA -52cX following daily QC testing. The following grid survey approach will be performed b y the UXO team: UXO technicians will travel along individual search lanes spaced 5 ft apart (a maximum of 2.5 ft to each side of sweep personnel). A Schonstedt GA -52cX will be used to detect anomalies in a manner to ensure complete coverage within the 5- ft-wide lane for each instrument operator. Each lane will be surveyed to achieve complete coverage within the established grid boundaries. Visual observations will also be made by the team and recorded in RespondFast as each transect is traversed. Leaf litter and detritus will be removed to the ground surface to investigate items. If a metallic item is observed, the UXO technician will investigate the item and remove it. Non-munitions- related debris not movable or too numerous in quantity (i.e., abandoned ve hicles, rail sections, trash piles) will be left in place but inspected for MEC and MD by UXO technicians. Investigation results will be documented in RespondFast. The item location will be recorded using a GPS and transferred to the project GIS. Inaccess ible areas within grids will be noted in RespondFast. 3.7.4.2 Subsurface Removal Action Procedures A focused subsurface MEC removal to detection depth will be performed at the herbaceous openings located within the Ricochet Area MRS. This component includes the removal of MEC detected on the ground surface and to detection depth using DGM instrumentation like the EM61 -MK2 that uses Time -Domain Electromagnetic Induction technology. The EM61 -MK2 sensor can typically detect the type of MEC anticipated to be encountere d at the Ricochet Area MRS from 4 inches to 67 inches bgs. The depth of detection is highly dependent upon site - specific conditions, including munitions item type and size, geology, and overall geophysical conditions. It is anticipated that minimal brush c learing will be required to facilitate subsurface removal activities. If necessary, brush clearing will be conducted. Sensitive habitat and cultural features or obstructions that are observed during the operations will be logged by the geophysical team and presented on the DGM grid maps for evaluation during the target selection process. Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- will be performed once the grid digital geophysical data are processed and approved. The following anomaly reacquisition and investigation approach w ill be performed by the UXO team: The selected DGM anomalies will be located in the field using an RTK GPS or equivalent. The anomaly location will be marked using a non- metallic pin flag with the unique anomaly ID. Multiple pin flags will be used to ma rk the boundary of potential burial pits. A UXO technician will use a Schonstedt GA -52cX to pinpoint the anomaly, and the location will be investigated to determine the anomaly source. Intrusive investigation results will be documented in RespondFast. Off sets between the reacquired location and the actual item location will also be entered into RespondFast. An EM61- MK2 will be used in the event that the Schonstedt GA -52cX is unable to resolve the DGM anomaly location. 3.7.5 Munition with the Greatest The 155mm M107 HE projectile with trinitrotoluene (TNT) filler is the munition with the greatest fragmentation distance (MGFD). The maximum fragment distance of this projectile is 2,894 ft. However, if a munition with a greater fragmentation distance is encountered during operations, then the USACE representative will be notified to determine new quantity -distance (Q-D) arcs in accordance with DDESB TP 16 (DDESB, 2012). Operations will continue, and an amendment to the ESS will be promptly submitted by USACE for DDESB approval. 3.7.6 Minimum Separation Distances The minimum separation distance (MSD) for the MRS is designated in the project ESS. Anomalies will be investigated by UXO teams only when an exclusion zone has been established around the anomaly location. The exclusion zone is based on the MGFD (see Table 3-7). The hazardous fragment distance (HFD) for the MGFD will be used as the exclusion zone distance. No intrusive work will be performed until non- essential personnel are separated from the anomaly location by the HFD. The exclusion zone will be maintai ned by the UXO team until the excavation is complete. If an area cannot be blocked, spotters will alert the UXO team when non- essential personnel need to enter the exclusion zone. In this case, intrusive operations will be discontinued until the non- essential personnel leave the area. Contract No: W912DR- 3.7.7 MEC Removal The following investigation procedures will be used when investigating anomalies: The item will be considered MEC or MPPEH until it is identified. The appropriate exclusion zone ( Table 3 -7) for the MRS will be maintained during excavation. For surface anomalies, leaf litter and detritus will be removed down to the ground surface to investigate items. If a detected anomaly is not exposed or partially exposed after moving leaf litter and detritus down to ground surface, investigation of the detected anomaly will cease and UXO personnel will continue with surface removal activities. For subsurface anomalies, excavation will commence adjacent to the anomaly and will continue until the depth of the anomaly has been reached. Excavations will be continually checked using a Schonstedt GA -52cX to avoid direct contact with the item. The sidewall of excavations will then be expanded to expose the item for inspection and identification. Earthmoving equipment (mini- excavator) may be used when the depth of the item cannot be managed by manual excavation. Excavations will be performed in shallow lifts while UXO technicians perform anomaly avoidance procedures. Mechanical excavations will be used only until the excavation is within 12 inches from the item. Manual excavations will be used to remove the remaining soil cover. The item will be identified only when two qualified UXO technicians have performed an inspection. Field activities at the investigation location will stop when MEC or MPPEH is identified. The item will be marked with pin flags or flagging and the disposal of the item will be coordinated and scheduled for later that same day. If the item is not disposed of that day, the item will be guarded until disposal can be scheduled and performed. If the subsurface contact proves to be MD or non- munitions related, the item will be removed and the hole rechecked with a Schonstedt GA-52cX. When the anomaly has been resolved or the hole is deemed \"clear \" of additional metallic material, the excavation will be refilled and tamped. Restoration procedures are provided in Section 3.8. If an item is discovered to be at depths below 4 ft, the UXO team will conspicuously mark the location with flagging and continue to the next anomaly. The item greater than 4 ft will be reported to the SUXOS for documentation, and the Ordnance and Explosive Safety Specialist (OESS) and project team will be notified to determine appropriate future actions. Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- Storage No MEC wi ll be stored. 3.7.9 MEC Demolition and Disposal WESTON will conduct the demolition activities on an as -needed basis and in accordance with the ESS ( Appendix C ) and the Demolition Operating Procedure ( Appendix E ). The demolition activities will follow the require ments of Technical Manual (TM) 60A -1-1- 31 (USACE, 1994); EM 385-1- 97, Explosives Safety and Health Requirements (USACE, 2013); and applicable ATF, federal, state, and local regulations. MEC and MPPEH will be disposed of in one of three ways: (1) blown- in-place (BIP) (2) transported to a safe area within the MRS to be destroyed, or (3) Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) will respond. Demil by explosive demolition of any item will not occur until it has been positively identified. The SUXOS or designee will notify the USACE OESS, PAARNG Safety Officer, and FIG Range Control who may request EOD support if the following scenarios are encountered during the course of this project: MEC cannot be identified as a conventional explosive. The fuze cannot be identified by type or function. Chemical warfare materiel is suspected. MEC and MPPEH that is not acceptable to move will be BIP within the MRS. MEC and MPPEH that is deemed acceptable to move by the SUXOS and UXOSO, the item will be relocated to the most advantage ous area or the area that will minimize impacts within the MRS. WESTON will coordinate with USACE and local authorities prior to demolition activities. The demolition activities will not commence until all parties on the notification roster have been infor med. The Demolition Notification Roster is provided in Table 3 -8. The designated demolition supervisor will possess a Pennsylvania Blaster's License and will be responsible for all aspects of conducting demolition operations. A minimum of three UXO - qualified personnel, one of whom will be the Team Leader, will conduct demolition operations. Detonations will be scheduled by the SUXOS in conjunction with the USACE OESS on the basis of the weather and logistical considerations. Prevailing weather condition inf ormation will be obtained from a reliable source. These data will be logged before each on -site detonation. The demolition charges will not be primed or connected for electrical firing during the approach or presence of a thunderstorm. Other weather conditions (high winds, dust storms, temperature inversions, low altitude clouds, or cloud coverage of more than 50%) may adversely impact planned demolition operations. The SUXOS will consider these conditions when determining whether or not to conduct demolition operations. If the weather conditions preclude the detonation, WESTON personnel will secure and cover the item with sandbags and properly mark the area, until favorable conditions allow the demolition. The personnel will remain at the MRS as long as the possibility of fire exists as the result of a demolition operation. Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- 3-21 The control of the demolition site must be maintained during the demolition operations. Non- essential personnel, including all residents or workers within the MSD, must evacuate to a safe area. The access roads entering the detonation area will be blocked during the explosive disposal operations to ensure that unsuspecting individuals are not placed in jeopardy by the explosion. The UXOSO and Demolition Team Leader will ensure that the are a is clear of unauthorized personnel and equipment prior to permitting the attachment of the initiation devices to the priming charge. The control of the initiation devices will remain with the Demolition Team Leader until attachment to the firing circuit. An observer will be stationed where there is a good view of the approaches to the demolition site. It will be the responsibility of the observer to notify the Team Leader to suspend firing if a vehicle or person is seen approaching the general demolition site. The demolition materials will be accounted for by the demolition team at all times. Only the estimated amount needed to complete the day's demolition operations will be transported to the work area. Sandbag mitigation may be used for intentional detonations as delineated in the Use of Sand Bags for Mitigation of Fragmentation and Blast Effects due to Intentional Detonation of Munitions, HNC -ED-CS-S-98- 7 (Army, 1998) and Amendment 1 dated February 2011, EM -CX safety advisory dated 7 November 2011, and DDESB Memo of November 29, 2010 Clarifications Regarding Use of Sandbags for Mitigation of Fragmentation and Blast Effects due to Intentional Detonation of Munitions (DDESB, 2010). This engineering control may be applied to mitigate fragmentation and blast hazards to the MSD identified in TP 16 for the item being destroyed. A copy of HNC -ED-CS-S-98- 7, Amendment 1, and the DDESB Memo will be available on -site if this engineering control is applied. Only one MEC item will be destroyed at a time using this tec hnique. The unique demolition sites will be photographed with a digital camera prior to and after firing of the shot, and the photograph(s) will be saved electronically for the Site Specific Final Report. At a minimum after each detonation, the detonation points and general demolition site will be inspected to ensure that a misfire, low order, or kick- out has not occurred. The area where demolition operations are being conducted will remain secured until the SUXOS, in consultation with the USACE OESS and UXOSO, gives the \"all clear.\" In the event of a fire or unplanned explosion, site personnel will be responsible for extinguishing the fire. If they are unable to do so, they will notify the FIG Range Control Fire Desk and evacuate the area. NOTE: Do not attempt to fight explosive fires . 3.7.10 Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard WESTON UXO technicians will classify recovered items as MPPEH, MD, UXO , or DMM. WESTON UXO technicians will inspect MPPEH to determine whether it is material documented as an explosive hazard (MDEH) or material documented as safe (MDAS). UXO, DMM, and MDEH will be disposed of by detonation using the standard demolition procedures outlined in TM 60A-1-1-31 (USACE, 1994) and the Demolition SOP in Appendix E. Contract No: W912DR- 3-22 WESTON ensures that the materials are inspected on the exterior and interior surfaces to be certain that these items do not present an explosive hazard. WESTON employs a four -level process for the inspection of MPPEH. 1. 100% inspection and 100% re -inspection by the UXO team, once by a UXO Technician II and once by the UXO Team Leader (Technician III). Both inspections will include the signatures of the UXO personnel conducting the inspections and the inspection dates. 2. Inspection by the UXOQCS during daily audits of the procedures used by UXO teams for processing MPPEH. 3. The UXOQCS ensures the procedures and responsibilities for processing MPPEH for certification as MDAS are being followed and performs random checks of processed MDAS and metal debris. 4. The SUXOS/UXOQCS is r esponsible for ensuring the Work Plan and the QC Plan detail the specifics of the procedures to be followed to process MPPEH. The SUXOS will perform or witness a 100% re -inspection and sign the DD Form 1348- 1A. The UXOQCS or other technically qualified per sonnel will perform or witness the 100% inspection or an independent QA inspection of processed material using an approved sampling method. Cultural debris and MDAS will be transported to a secure area prior to final disposition off -site. As the material is being loaded, a UXO Technician III will perform a second inspection of the material to ensure it is segregated correctly. When certified and verified as free of explosive hazards, the material collected during the RA will be placed in containers and sealed. Each container will be closed in a manner that requires that the seal be broken to gain access to the interior of the container. The containers will be labeled with a unique identification as follows: USACE/Ricochet/Weston Solutions, Inc./Container D will be used as certification/verification documentation for MDAS. The DD Form 1348- 1A will clearly show the printed names of the SUXOS and USACE OESS, organization, signature, and contractor's home office and field office phone numbers of the SUXOS. The DD Form 1348- 1A will list the following: Basic material content. Estimated weight. Unique identification of each of the container and seal number. Location where the MDAS was obtained. Penn sylvania's Department of Military and Veterans Affairs cultural resources manager will be given the opportunity to assess whether the MDAS and non- munitions related debris have a cultural resources/historical significance and may be donated to the Fort Indiantown Gap Museum or local museums. Remaining non- munitions related debris will be made available to Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- 3-23 Community Interest Group members to give the public the opportunity to claim prior to recycling. Certified MDAS will be transferred to a certified recycling center with the completed DD Form 1348- 1A. The SUXOS will sign the Certificate as follows: \"This certifies and verifies that the material listed has been 100 percent inspected and to the best of our knowledge and belief, is inert and/or free of explosive hazards.\" In accordance with 40 CFR 261.6(a)(3), scrap metal, if recycled, is not subject to Parts 262 -266, or 268, 270, or 124. WESTON will recycle scrap metal generated as a result of necessary removal and will maintain records of recycling. 3.8 SITE RESTORATION Excavation/detonation holes will be backfilled with the soils excavated from the location or additional fill as necessary. 3.9 WORK SCHEDULE Project activities may be performed throughout the year, and intrusive operations are anticipated to run from June through September. The UXO teams will be working up to a 50 -hour work week to ensure that field activities are completed on schedule. Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- Boundary Control Points 18N, Feet.

The UXOQCS is responsible for monitoring site activities affecting quality and for ensuring that these activities are being carried out in accordance with established requirements Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- protocols in this QCP. The UXOQCS is responsible for conducting QC inspections of intrusive and explosives operations for compliance with the established procedures. The UXOQCS will perform daily surveillance of the work activities and issue corrective actions as necessary. The UXOQCS will prepare DQCR documenting QC processes and results. The UXOQCS will perform the inspection process based on definable features of work (DFW) in Section 4.3.1. 4.1.5 Geophysics QC Manager The Geophysics QC Manager is responsible for the quality of the digital geophysical data. Responsibilities include performing reviews of raw and processed geophysical data and audits of geophysical team proced ures, and recommending actions to be taken in the event of geophysical data QC nonconformance. The Geophysics QC Manager will recommend and provide solutions to quality problems. 4.2 PERSONNEL QUALIFICAT IONS AND TRAINING Project staff will be qualified to perf orm the specific tasks they are assigned on the project, as discussed in Section 2 of the Work Plan. At the beginning of the project, personnel will provide their training and qualification records to the UXOQCS for approval. The records will be available on-site and will be reviewed periodically so that current records are maintained. 4.2.1 Qualifications and Training for UXO Personnel UXO- qualified personnel and/or UXO technicians will meet the requirements of DDESB TP -18, Minimum Qualifications for Unexploded Ordnance Technicians and Personnel (DDESB, 2004). Prior to beginning field work or new phases of work, the UXOQCS will review the work processes with project personnel to ensure that they are adequately trained/versed in the phase of work requirements, standards, and procedures. The health and safety training requirements will be documented in the Accident Prevention Plan/Site Safety and Health Plan (APP/SSHP) (see Appendix B ). 4.3 THREE PHASE INSPECTI ON PROCESS The UXOQCS or a designee is responsible for verifying compliance with this portion of the QCP. A three phase inspection (TPI) process will be used to ensure that project activities comply with approved procedures and methods. The TPI process includes a preparatory, initial, and follow- up phase inspection for each project DFW. A final inspection will be performed at the completion of a DFW. The DFWs, inspection descriptions, responsible personnel, and potential failure actions are provided in Table 4 -1. Specific magnetometer inspection methods and failure criteria are presented in Table 4 -2. The TPI process elements are presented in the following sections. 4.3.1 Definable Features of Work DFWs have been developed for each aspect of the project from planning to implementation to reporting. The primary DFWs are as follows: Contract No: 1. Site setup/mobilization of personnel, equipment, and supplies. 2. Grid survey activities. 3. Brush clearing. 4. Geophysical equipment testing and verification. 5. DGM operations. 6. Surface and subsurface removal operations. 7. Demolition/disposal. 8. MPPEH and MDAS accountability. 9. Demobilization. The DFWs, inspection descriptions, responsible personnel, and potential failure actions are provided in Table 4 -1. 4.3.2 Preparatory Phase Inspection The preparatory phase inspection comprises the planning and design process leading up to the field activities. The preparatory phase inspection will be performed prior to initiating each DFW. The UXOQCS or a designee will review the appropriate documentati on to ensure the requirements to carry out each DFW are in place and compliant. The UXOQCS will verify that required planning documentation, including the Work Plan and appendices, have been approved and available for site personnel. Equipment, sensors, a nd materials delivered to the site will be inspected to ensure that they are functional and that all required components are inventoried. Personnel certifications will be reviewed to ensure that appropriate training has been provided and that medical clear ance and licenses are available based on assigned responsibilities and site -specific requirements. The UXOQCS or a designee will determine whether the personnel needed to carry out the DFW are identified, are available, and meet the qualifications of the position and to ensure that positions are filled accordingly. Where site conditions or constraints prohibit carrying out a specific DFW, a UXOQCS will designate personnel to correct or resolve discrepancies. Work plan discrepancies will be corrected and su bsequently verified by the UXOQCS or a designee before beginning the DFW. 4.3.3 Initial Phase Inspection The initial phase inspection will begin at the startup of a DFW. The work performed as part of the DFW will be inspected for compliance with established procedures so that a high level of quality can be obtained from task commencement to completion. The UXOQCS will document the inspection results in the QC logbook that will be transcribed daily to the DQCR. The DQCR will list the DFW(s), QC requirements, and inspection processes performed that day based on the DFW checklist ( Table 4 -1). An example of the QC Report is provided in Appendix D. If the inspection results identify discrepancies between the approved plans and site practices, a discrepancy resolution process will be implemented. The appropriate expert based on discipline (chemistry, safety, munitions) will be engaged to support the Project Manager and project team in resolving discrepancies immediately after they are identified. The ultimate resolution will be Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- 4-3 made by the Project Manager. If the discrepancy cannot be resolved, the nonconformance will be documented in a Corrective Action Request (CAR). A discussion of the CAR process is presented in Section 4.4.4. When an unresolved discrepancy is identif ied as potentially causing a nonconformance, the work activities will be recommended to stop until a resolution can be documented and approved. 4.3.4 Follow -Up Phase Inspection (Surveillance) Scheduled and unscheduled inspections will be performed as part of the follow -up phase. The purpose of these inspections is to ensure that a high level of quality is maintained by monitoring compliance that the project plans and procedures on an ongoing basis. The UXOQCS has primary responsibility for on- site verification o f the work practices in relation to the DFW inspection requirements. However, the SUXOS is also responsible for monitoring performance. The following will be performed for each DFW: Inspections and surveillance to ensure compliance with project plans. Inspections and surveillance to ensure a high level of workmanship is maintained. Inspections and surveillance to ensure log books are complete. Inspections and surveillance to ensure compliance with the inspection frequency and requirements documented in Tabl e 4-1. Checks for the process and procedures used during execution of this Work Plan will be conducted by the Project Manager, SUXOS, UXOQCS, UXOSO, and/or geophysicist. Process integrity is defined as conformance to specifications and requirements in the Work Plan including regulations and standards such as QC metrics established in Section 3. Specific inspection methods and failure criteria are presented in Table 4 -2. These checks will consist of visual observations of the methods used and are part of the Follow- Up Inspections conducted during the performance of each DFW. Results of the follow -up phase inspections will be documented in the UXOQCS log book and summarized in the DQCR. 4.3.5 Final Phase Inspection At the completion of all work associated with a DFW, the UXOQCS will conduct an inspection of the work. The work should be inspected for conformance to plans, specifications, quality, workmanship, and completeness. An itemized list will be compiled that in cludes a summary of work not properly completed, inferior workmanship, and work not conforming to plans and specifications. The list will be documented as a nonconformance in the DQCR with an estimated date for correction of each discrepancy. If the discrepancy cannot be reconciled, a CAR will be prepared as discussed in Section 4.4.4. Following correction of work, a second inspection will be conducted by the UXOQCS to ensure that all deficiencies have been corrected. The inspections and resolutions will be completed within the schedule stated for completion of the entire work, or any particular increment thereof if the project is divided into increments by separate completion dates. Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- 4.4 DOCUMENTING DEFICIENCIES AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS The UXOQCS is responsible for verifying compliance with this QCP through audits and inspections of the DFWs. The Project Manager will also coordinate with the UXO Operations QC Manager as deemed necessary following reviews, audits, and inspections at the project level to confirm t hat work is progressing in accordance with the Work Plan. Discrepancies are to be communicated to the responsible individual and documented in the DQCRs. 4.4.1 Corrective Action Process The Project Manager and UXOQCS are responsible for ensuring that the proced ures for reporting, evaluating, and correcting nonconformance are addressed through the planned QC procedures. The determination of any nonconforming conditions must be supported with objective evidence. The nonconforming conditions will be evaluated and c orrected and may be considered as opportunities to improve the process during the RA. 4.4.2 Continuous Improvement Personnel are encouraged to continuously review their processes and to suggest changes that improve the process; provide benefits; or improve proje ct efficiency, safety, and quality. These suggestions can be submitted either formally through a written memorandum to the SUXOS or to the UXOQCS or informally through verbal discussions at project meetings. 4.4.3 Deficiency Identification and Resolution Personnel have the responsibility to identify and report conditions adverse to quality. The deficiencies will be identified, documented, investigated, and corrected appropriately. The Project Manager and UXOQCS are responsible for evaluating the causes of the deficiencies or the nonconformance and for recommending solutions to correct the deficiency identified. The UXOQCS will be responsible for verifying implementation of the corrective action and for monitoring the effectiveness of the corrective action for each DFW ( Table 4 -1). 4.4.4 Corrective Action Request A CAR can be issued by any member of the project team, including subcontractor personnel. The CAR is also issued by the UXOQCS when a discrepancy is identified that cannot be resolved following the DFW inspection (at any phase). The CAR will be provided to the Project Manager, who will evaluate the request based on input from the UXOQCS and subject matter experts. If the CAR is accepted, the Project Manager will develop a corrective strategy, assign resources, an d specify a schedule for corrective actions. The UXOQCS will verify the effectiveness of the corrective action once it has been implemented and completed. Reoccurring reviews of the CAR will be performed to ensure that the established protocols for correct ive actions are being implemented properly and the desired intent is being achieved. Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- 4-5 As part of the CAR, a root cause analysis will be conducted to identify the factors that led to the problem. Criteria to be considered in the analysis will include personnel qualifications, training, adequacy of procedures, adequacy of equipment, and adequacy of QC inspections and measures. Input will be obtained from field personnel as necessary and technical experts to support the analysis. The nonconformance will be tra ced back to the problem using reverse engineering as applicable. An example of the CAR form is provided in Appendix D . At a minimum, the nonconformance will be documented on the CAR within 24 hours of occurrence. The date when the corrective action will ne ed to be completed and integrated will be discussed with the project team and documented on the CAR and DQCR. 4.4.5 Corrective Action Tracking Each CAR will be tracked with a unique identifier for the duration of the field activities. The review, approval, implementation, and completion dates will be tracked in a tabular format in the project file. 4.4.6 Lessons Learned CARs will be attached to the DQCRs. The intent is to document discrepancies and corrective actions to share lessons learned with the project team. CARs will be made topics of daily tailgate meetings as appropriate to ensure that project staff are aware of the situation and the corrective strategy. 4.5 PROJECT COMMUNICATIO N Daily briefings will be held with the field personnel to review the project activ ities and to discuss technical and safety issues. The SUXOS and UXOQCS will conduct the meetings and ensure that the Daily Summary Report is completed and signed by the field personnel. The UXOQCS may schedule additional meetings to discuss technical and quality issues at any time. The SUXOS will maintain communications with the project management team and report any significant problems or decisions to the Project Manager for assistance. The project QC aspects will also be documented in the UXOQCS Log and DQCR for specific DFWs. 4.5.1 Weekly Project Meeting A project team meeting will be held at least once per week during the RA field activities with the field operations and project management personnel. The meeting will be used to discuss project progress and QC related issues. An agenda will be distributed prior to the meeting.

Explosives Purchase Permit (PADEP). Pennsylvania Blaster's Li cense. 5.3 ACQUISITIONS WESTON will purchase explosives on an as -needed -basis from a licensed commercial vendor for same -day delivery. If same- day delivery is not possible, on- site security will be provided for those MEC items that cannot be demolished the same day as identified. Vendor information will be provided as required. Prior to bringing the explosives on- site to private property, the SUXOS will coordinate with the USACE OESS, ARNG, PAARNG, and FIG and local law enforcement. 5.4 INITIAL RECEIPT For this field effort, a magazine will not be established on- site. Explosives that are delivered to the site will be placed in a Day Box mounted in the beds of a truck and will be used the same day. The following procedures will be adhered to upon initial receipt o f explosive materials (see Figure 5-1): Upon arrival at the site, the SUXOS will escort the vendor/supplier to a designated area for loading/unloading. An individual authorized to receive the explosives will compare the explosives delivery record to the actual quantity delivered prior to accepting custody for the explosives. Once the quantity has been confirmed, the explosive delivery record will be signed and the explosives transferred to and stored in the approved Day Box mounted on the trucks. Explosives will be recorded on a magazine data card, such as DA Form 3020. All material introduced or removed from the Day Boxes will be entered on stack Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- 5-1 cards and explosive records will be updated. If it is determined that there is a discrepancy between the quantit y delivered and the quantity shipped, the following will occur: - The UXOSO will be notified. - The shipment will not be accepted. - The shipper will be contacted immediately to resolve the discrepancy. Note: If the discrepancy cannot be resolved within 24 hours , the local law enforcement agency, ATF, WESTON Program H&S Manager, WESTON MEC QC Manager, and WESTON Project Manager will be notified. All original receipts, shipping documents, or invoices will be retained on -site as part of records management. Copies of the documentation will be provided in the final report as an appendix. 5.5 STORAGE No explosives magazine will be established on -site. All explosives will be consumed the same day received. 5.6 TRANSPORTATION All vehicles transporting explosives will be properly inspected, equipped, and placarded prior to loading the explosives onto the vehicle, in accordance with Section 29 of EM 385-1-1, Safety and Health Requirements Manual (USACE, 2008). The transportation of explosives from the point of receipt to locations requiring demolition operations will be conducted in the following manner: 1. Vehicles will be inspected prior to each use and will be properly placarded. 2. Explosives will be transported in closed vehicles whenever possible. When using an open vehicle, explosi ves will be covered with a flame- resistant tarpaulin (except when loading/unloading) or transported in an approved container. 3. The vehicle engine will not be running, and wheel chocks and brakes will be set when loading/unloading explosives. 4. Beds of vehicles will have dunnage, plastic bed liner, or sandbags to protect the explosives from contact with the metal bed and fittings. 5. Vehicles transporting explosives will have a first aid kit, two 10 -ABC -rated fire extinguishers, and communication capabiliti es. 6. Initiating explosives, such as detonators, will remain separated from other high explosives during loading, unloading, and while on vehicles. Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- 5-2 7. Compatibility requirements will be observed. 8. Operators transporting explosives will have a valid driver's lice nse. 9. Drivers will comply with posted speed limits, but will not exceed a safe and reasonable speed for conditions. 10. Vehicles transporting explosives off-road will not exceed 20 mph. 5.7 DOCUMENTATION Any time explosives are being transported, completed copies of the documents described below will be in the vehicle: Instructions for Motor Vehicle Owners - Emergency Response Information \u2014Only those items that are being transported will be entered on the form (provided in Appendix D) with the applicable quantity/units and weight columns completed. All required data will be entered. Explosives Purchase/Receipt/Transport Authorization List \u2014This list (provided in Appendix D) will be completed to ensure that the pertinent data for personnel transporting explosives are included on the form. As with the other required forms, this form will be part of the transport paperwork. Only the route shown will be used unless there is an emergency or the route is blocked. Motor Vehicle Inspection Checklist \u2014The checklist (provided in A ppendix D) will be completed before explosives are placed in the vehicle and will accompany the shipment. A copy of the current ATF permit/license will be maintained in the field office. 5.8 RETURN OF UNUSED EXP LOSIVES All explosives ordered on an as -needed -basis will be consumed on the same day received. 5.9 DISPOSAL OF REMAININ G EXPLOSIVES All explosives ordered and received will be consumed on the same day received. 5.10 LOSS, THEFT, AND UNA UTHORIZED USE OF EXPLOSIVES Loss or theft of explosives will be reported as stated in 27 CFR on Commerce in Explosives. Table 5 -1 lists the individuals or organizations to be notified upon the discovery of theft or loss of explosives.

The Environmental Protection Plan (EPP) has been specifically developed to document site- specific environmental conditions in and adjacent to the Ricochet Area MRS project work area (located in SGL 211). The EPP addresses the potential impacts that the proposed action may have on the surrounding environment and suggests measures to be implemented during the proposed actions to protect identified environmentally sensitive areas. The goals of the EPP include: Present a methodology to minimize the pollution of air, water, and land resources. Protect identified, site -specific, environmentally sensitive, cultural and/or historical resources. Safely and efficiently execute the RA at the project work area, in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. In addition to the EPP, an SOP was developed ( Appendix F ) to provide guidance for minimizing/eliminating the disruption to special plant and animal species within the Ricochet Area MRS. Before field activities commence, a training will be held for site personnel to revie w the SOP and the EPP. 6.2 EXISTING CONDITION S URVEY Prior to the start of any field activities, an existing conditions survey will be conducted to document and mark natural resources, such as wetlands and species of special concern, which require protection or avoidance. Data collection will commence during survey activities to record the status of initial site conditions for activities, if applicable. This process is intended to by -pass protected areas and to determine existing conditions. A discussion of the existing environmental conditions believed to be present in the Ricochet Area MRS is presented in the following sections. 6.2.1 Biological Resources WESTON will follow the requirements of the Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program (PNHP), formerly known as the Pennsylvania Natural Diversity Index (PNDI), to d etermine whether there may be potential impacts to threatened and endangered and/or special concern species and resources within the Ricochet Area MRS. The term PNDI remains a valid term for the Environmental Review (ER) Tool used to conduct an environmental review. The PNDI tool search results required further review. WESTON submitted a signed copy of the Project Environmental Review Receipt, a project narrative with a Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- the overall project and a USGS 7.5- minute quadrangle with the project boundaries and quad name marked on the map to the following agencies: Department of Conservation and Natural Resource Bureau of Forestry, Ecological Services Section. Pennsylvania Game Commission, Bureau of Land Management. Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, Natural Diversity Section. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Endangered Species Biologist. The estimated response for the environmental review request is a minimum of 30 days. Based on agency responses, the information in this section will be confirmed and updated, if necessary. 6.2.1.1 Plant Communities The Ricochet Area MRS consists primarily of montane hardwood-conifer forests in upland areas, with northern hardwood -conifer forests along the lower slopes (mostly north- facing slopes). These northern hardwood- conifer forests are also often found in small ravines and along stream courses, such as Stony Creek. Forming the major subdominant plant community in the lower slopes of Stony Creek Valley are chestnut ( Acer rubrum ) becomes more significant farther up the slope with the chestnut oak remaining the major subdominant plant. At the ridge tops, the chestnut oaks, striped maple (Acer pennsylvanicum ), domina nt species. 6.2.1.1.1 Federally Threatened or Endangered Species The Ricochet Area MRS does not contain federally listed threatened or endangered plant species. 6.2.1.1.2 Special Status Species American holly ( Ilex opaca ) - Pennsylvania N atural Diversity Inventory (PNDI) listed Threatened Species. The American holly is an evergreen shrub or small tree that grows to 50 ft in height. It can be easily recognized by its semi -thick, evergreen leaves with a sharp spine at the tip and additional spines along the margin. The flowers, which appear in May and June, are unisexual, so that the familiar berry -like fruit, red at maturity, can be found only on female plants. American holly has a distribution from coastal New England south and west into Fl orida and Texas. In Pennsylvania, it is near the northern end of its range, and occurs mostly in the southeastern counties. The species grows on wooded slopes and stream banks . Species. The netted chainfern grows from 1\u00bd to 2\u00bd ft in height, and may form small colonies as a result of the presence of creeping underground stems. The leaves are easily distinguishable into vegetative and fertile types. The vegetative leaves have a typical fern -like appearance, being green, flattened , and divided into 7 to 12 very deep lobes (or distinct leaflets on the lower part of the leaf). The leaf veins are conspicuous and have a net -like or chain -like arrangement, as the common name implies. The fertile leaves of netted chainfern are dark colored, much narrower, not flattened and leaf -like, and have spore - producing structures on their underside. The vegetative leaf of this species resembles the leaf of the sensitive fern (Onoclea sensibilis ), a common species in Pennsylvania, but the lobes in netted chainfern tend to be alternately arranged along the leaf stalk whereas the lobes of sensitive fern tend to be oppositely arranged. The distribution is mainly on the Atlan tic coastal plain from Nova Scotia south and west into Texas and Florida. In Pennsylvania, the species has been documented historically in scattered counties, particularly in the Delaware River drainage. It grows in swamps, seepages, wet woods, boggy wetlands, and along the margins of streamlets. Minniebush ( Menziesia pilosa) - Potential Species of Concern (although not listed in the current PNDI request and response). More common in the southern Appalachians, a relative of the blueberry, the minniebush has a limited distribution in Pennsylvania. Although historically reported from a few counties in western Pennsylvania, this shrub is currently known to occur only in Cumberland, Dauphin, Lebanon, and Schuylkill Counties. The minniebush is also found in high elevations and has distinctive small apricot colored bell -like flowers, blooming in summer. The minniebush was not listed in the PNDI request and response and no minniebush were observed during the RI fieldwork. However, potential forested stream bank habi tat exists for this species within the project area so it is being considered as a potential species of concern. Fact sheets presenting additional information about these three special status species are provided in Appendix F . Photo Wildlife The habitat of the Ricochet Area MRS supports a diverse mix of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and benthic macroinvertebrates, including insects Ricochet Area MRS acts as a migration corridor for hawks on the ridgelines and serves as a wintering and breeding habitat for bluebird species. 6.2.1.2.1 Federally Threatened or Endangered Species The Ricochet Area MRS does not contain federally listed threatened or endangered wildlife species. 6.2.1.2.2 Special Status Species Hand -Maid Moth ( Datana ranaeceps ) -A PNDI listed Special Concern Species, the hand -maid moth has a wing span of 1 to 1 \u00bd inches with dark -brown forewings and light brown hindwings. This moth is known to occur prima rily in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York but may reside in other states. Larvae are known to feed on staggerbushes (Lyonia spp.) as a host plant, and nocturnal adults do not feed. It requires mixed hardwood forests, hardwood -pine mixes, and scrubland- grassland -woodland mixes. Information on behavior and general biology are lacking at this time. Black Dash ( Euphyes conspicua) - A PNDI listed Special Concern Species, the Black Dash has a wingspan of 1 to 1 3/8 inches, is richly colored, has a medium -sized skipper and is best distinguished by its hindwing pattern. In both males and the dark females, both above and below, there is a distinctive vaguely diamond- shape patch of yellow surrounded by the much more extensive darker background. The forewing pattern above in males is dominated by a thick, sooty- black stigma under a patch of yellow. The female's forewing above has a bold crescent of yellow spots, some of them translucent. Its distribution is Southern Ontario, Minnesota, and eastern Nebraska around the southern periphery of the Great Lakes; southern New England south through eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia. Larval food plants consist of Tussock -Sedge ( Carex stricta ), and adults can be found nectaring on flowering plants, and common and swamp milkweeds. The habitat of the Black Dash consists of wetlands where its food plant occurs, including marshy edges, river meadows, and bogs as well as in nearby uplands is a PNDI listed Special Concern Species. Information on behavior and general biology are lacking at this time. Source: unknown photo listed Threatened Species, the Allegheny woodrat ranges in size from 14 to 17 inches in total length (including tail). The fur is brownish-gray with slightly darker coloration in the middle of the back. The belly and paws are white and the sides are buff. The Allegheny woodrat has large ears and a furry, bi -colored tail. Its habitat includes cliff faces, boulder piles, talus slopes, and sometimes limestone caves. Nests composed of shredded plant fibers are found in dry cave entrances, along narrow ledges, and in rock crevices. This sp ecies feeds on nuts, bark, grasses, fruits, and berries. Allegheny woodrats are nocturnal and a relatively shy species. The distribution of the Allegheny woodrat is primarily along the Appalachian Mountains from New York to Georgia and west to Indiana. Timber rattlesnake ( Crotalus h. horridus) - Potential Species of Concern (although not listed in the current PNDI request and response). This snake occurs in the forested, mountainous regions of the Commonwealth. The timber rattlesnake prefers forested areas to forage for small mammals (e.g., mice and chipmunks) and talus, south to southeastern facing rocky slopes for hibernating and other thermoregulatory activities. The timber rattlesnake is threatened by overhunting, poaching, and habitat alteration. The t imber rattlesnake was not listed in the PNDI request and response. However, timber rattlesnakes were commonly found among the scattered boulder areas of the MRS during the RI fieldwork so it is being considered as a potential species of concern. 6.2.1.3 Aquatic Species 6.2.1.3.1 Federally Threatened or Endangered Species Water resources within the Ricochet Area MRS do not contain federally listed threatened or endangered wildlife species. 6.2.1.3.2 Special Status Species One macroinvertebrate, the Allegheny Cave Amphipod ( Stygobromus allegheniensis) , may occur in the Ricochet Area MRS and is a PNDI listed Special Concern Species. Amphipods are small invertebrate species (crustaceans) that inhabit cold water springs, seeps, on hillsides and in caves. Allegheny Cave Amphipod has one of the broadest ranges of any species in the genus. Yet, species is still relatively uncommon. These rare invertebrate species are threatened by habitat destruction and poor water quality. photo source: Cal Butchkowski Contract No: boundaries will be initially delineated spatially on GIS -generated maps using results referenced from the National Wetlands Inventory Report. In the field, project team personnel will carefully observe any grade changes and the presence of sphagnum moss on the ground surface when approaching these wetland areas. When nearing wetland areas, no additional pruning or trimming of vegetation will occur. Rare species, if found, will be avoided and will be documented in the field log. 6.2.3 Water Resources 6.2.3.1 Surface Water The Stony Creek watershed is primarily within the Ricochet MRS and contains three major tributaries to Stony Creek: Rausch Creek (not within the MRS); Yellow Springs in the center; and Rattling Run on the west side of the MRS. Stony Creek flows from northeast to southwest and drains into the Susquehanna River approximately 10 miles to the west of the western boundary of FIG. No natural lakes or ponds exist within the Ricochet Area MRS. The project team will work to cross the stream at existing stream crossovers to minimize impacts to Stony Creek. 6.2.3.2 Groundwater The Mauch Chunk Formation provides the most reliable source of groundwater with high yields capable of supporting public water suppliers and industry. Depths to adequate drinking water supplies for domestic use can usually be reached at less than 200 ft. Groundwater occurrence in the mountains may be associated with old coal mine workings and in the numerous fractures associated with the faults, folds, and jointing of the sedimentary rocks (PADER, 1979). Depth to the groundwater in this region averages 20 ft bgs. Groundwater is not likely to be impacted during the MEC RA. 6.2.4 Cultural and Archeological Resources Many prehistoric and historic archaeological cultural resources are located within the Ri cochet Area MRS footprint. Based on available records, including the St. Anthony's Wilderness website (Via, 2011), these include, but are not limited to, the following: Eleven house foundations west of the Rattling Run tributary associated with the minin g and railroad communities from the 1800s. An American Indian encampment near a spring on the south side of Sharp Mountain (artifacts dated to 4500-5500 BC). Rattling Run includes remnants of a stone inclined plane used for coal transport and structural fo undations, including a well at the top and bottom of the incline. The mines at Rattling Run were in active use from about 1825 to 1850. Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- Spring includes remnants of sawmill machinery near Stony Creek in the area of the Yellow Spring tributary. In addition, there is a stone tower/chimney at the top of a mine shaft. There is also a stone inclined plane used for coal transport. The minehead at Yellow Spring closed about 1859. Remnants of structural foundations associated with the historic Cold Spring re sort. The Cold Spring Resort and facilities date back to 1800s. This area was also noted for its cold spring water. As part of the remedial investigation (RI) planning effort, the Pennsylvania State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) was contacted to ide ntify historic places within the MRS worthy of preservation. The National Register of Historic Places listed the Fort Indiantown Gap Historic District as the closest place of historic significance. This historic district is located outside the MRS. In coop eration with the SHPO, field personnel will avoid conducting field activities within identified areas of significant historical and/or cultural significance and will follow the procedure outlined in the flow chart for Inadvertent Discovery of Cultural Remains ( Appendix G ). Before field activities commence, a training will be held for site personnel to review the flow chart for Inadvertent Discovery of Cultural Remains and the identification of historical/cultural items. 6.3 PROCEDURES FOR PROTE CTION OF RESOURCES 6.3.1 Trees and Shrubs 6.3.1.1 Tree and Shrub Removal Limited vegetation removal will be necessary in the MRS to aid survey and removal activities. The vegetation to be removed may include immature trees (less than 4 inches in diameter), low - lying tree branches, brush, and field grasses. All items will be cut to a level that allows clearance activities to proceed, but allows re -growth of the vegetation with time. Trees that are 4 inches in diameter or greater, measured from chest height, will not be cut unless specifically approved by the ARNG, PAARNG, USACE, and PGC. Activities will be in accordance with PGC Special Use Permit in Appendix H . WESTON will take all actions necessary to protect and prevent unnecessary damage to vegetation. WESTON personnel will dis turb only the vegetation necessary for safe and effective access for clearance activities. 6.3.1.2 Tree and Shrub Restoration Because of the limited vegetation removal activities planned in the MRS, no tree or shrub restoration is planned after removal activitie s are completed. 6.3.2 Waste Disposal Waste generated will be properly characterized and disposed of in accordance with applicable regulations and through approved channels. It is expected that only uncontaminated scrap metal Contract No: W912DR- 6-7 and trash will be generated as the result of this project. Generation of hazardous waste is not anticipated. WESTON will arrange for recycling of scrap metal. In accordance with 40 CFR 261.6(a)(3), scrap metal, if recycled, is not subject to Parts 262 -266, or 268, 270, or 124. WESTON will recycle all scrap metal generated as a result of necessary removal and maintain records of all recycling. 6.3.2.1 Nonhazardous Wastes Nonhazardous solid waste materials, such as trash and general debris, will be removed from the project site and transported off- site for disposal through the municipal waste system. 6.3.2.2 Hazardous Wastes WESTON does not anticipate generating contaminated wastes in the execution of this project and is not tasked to dispose of hazardous wastes under this DO. 6.3.3 Security of Hazardous Material s WESTON personnel will provide security to control the work area. Hazardous materials associated with the project (primarily explosives) will be secured as discussed in Section 5, Explosives Management Plan. 6.3.4 Burning Activities No burning activities are planned for this project. 6.3.5 Dust and Emission Control It is not anticipated that field activities will have any significant effect on air quality because demolition activities and normal vehicle use are considered minor mobile sources of air emissions. 6.3.6 Noise Control and Prevention A source of noise will be pulse noises resulting from demolition activities. Both tamping the demolition shot with earth (sand bag enclosure and buried explosion module) and observing weather conditions on the day of the shot will control this noise. For example, a day with a low cloud ceiling will transmit the nuisance noise more effectively than a clear day. To reduce the nuisance noise on a cloudy day, various options will be assessed. They include possibilities such as not conducting the demolition shot, waiting for a shift in prevailing winds, reducing the net explosive weight of the shot, or some combination of controls. The UXOSO, SUXOS and the Demolition Supervisor will determine the applicable method of noise control. Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- Spill Control and Prevention 6.3.7.1 General WESTON plans to conduct fueling and repair of vehicles off -site if possible. This practice will decrease the amount of pollutants that need to be stored on- site. Hazardous liquids that are absolutely necessary to conduct wor k activities will be stored in small quantities. WESTON anticipates that unleaded gasoline, diesel fuel No. 2, and motor oil will be the only substances with hazardous constituents that may be stored on- site, and they will be stored in quantities less than 5 gallons. If a discharge should occur, WESTON will provide spill kits on-site for the immediate cleanup of any petroleum product that may be inadvertently spilled. 6.3.7.2 Spill Potential The potential for a spill of pollutants during operations is unlikely based on the planned work activities. The highest probability for a spill will occur during re -fueling operations of equipment (e.g., filling a chainsaw's gas and oil tanks). In the event of a spill during this fueling operation, the largest quantity of a pollutant that can be lost at any one time is likely less than 1 gallon of gasoline. 6.3.7.3 Preventative Spill Control Measures All containers of liquids containing petroleum products or other chemicals with potentially hazardous constituents will be managed carefully and kept closed. The containers will be stored away from the main operations to decrease the chances of container damage and the chances of spillage. Vehicles will be maintained in good operating condition and left running only when necessary. All ve hicles will be fueled, maintained, and serviced at an off -site location. No routine cleaning or washing of vehicles or equipment will be permitted on- site. When refueling heavy equipment and/or small power tools on- site, the following measures will be taken: Spill pans will be placed on the ground under the fill cap to catch any spillage. The operator will not leave the fueling operation and will not latch the fueling nozzle into a continual flow position. The operator will continually monitor the fueling operation. When the equipment is full, the fuel flow will be stopped, the operator will wait at least 5 seconds for the fuel to drain from the nozzle, and then the nozzle will be withdrawn and turned open end up while being transported back to the fuel sour ce for stowage. Contract No: 6.3.7.4 Spill Response If fuel or oil is spilled, the following measures will be taken: The spill area will be isolated and contained. USACE, Dauphin County EMA, and Lebanon County EMA will be notified during a spill response. The liquid and affected soil will be shoveled into a plastic bag and subsequently placed into a U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved shipping container. Each container will be labeled to identify its contents. The container(s) will be shipped off -site and disposed of at a permitted facility in accordance with the CFR 260 - 270. 6.3.8 Storage Areas WESTON does not anticipate the construction or use of a temporary storage area. 6.3.9 Access Routes WESTON will use the existing road/trail network inside the MRS, and county and pr ivate community roads outside the MRS to gain access. No environmental impact is anticipated from the use of existing roads and trails because they are currently in use by personnel or from the use of county and private roads because they are used by the general public and private residents. For safety purposes, a main ingress/egress route will be established through the MRS. This route will allow utility terrain vehicle (UTV) access for emergency situations. Tree and shrub pruning will be avoided as much as possible. 6.3.10 Control of Water Runon and Runoff Runon and runoff water controls are not necessary because there is no expectation that contaminated soils, water, or waste are present on -site or that such materials will be generated while conducting activitie s on- site. Project activities will be conducted in a manner that prevents the discharge of pollutants into adjacent waterways. If any areas are adjacent to wetlands, sandbags or other barrier devices will be used to prevent the spread of potentially contam inated soil or water. 6.3.11 Temporary Facilities Temporary and support facilities (e.g., office trailers, Conex boxes) will be erected in coordination with ARNG, PAARNG, USACE, and PGC. The temporary facilities will be removed at the end of the project. Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- Decontamination and Disposal of Equipment Field operations of this project will be conducted in Level D PPE. No decontamination of personnel or equipment is anticipated to be performed. 6.3.13 Minimizing Areas of Disturbance Activities associated with this projec t will be conducted, where possible, in a manner that will minimize impacts to land resources. Areas impacted by the project will be restored, as practical, to a condition that appears to be natural and does not detract from the overall appearance of the site. Some type of site restoration may be performed in areas where earth has been disturbed during demolition operations. WESTON will work directly with PGC officials to determine whether restoration is warranted and what type of restoration may be required. The area of soil that will be disturbed on this project is not anticipated to be above the threshold that requires an erosion and sediment control plan and provisions. Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- 6-11 7. PROPERTY MANAGEMENT PLAN A Property Management Plan is used to describe how government furnished/owned equipment, materials, tools, and other supplies will be managed for a specific munitions response or other munitions- related project. This does not apply to firm fixed price task orders. No government equipment will be borrowed for use on this project. Contract No: W912DR- 09-D- INTERIM HOLDING FACILITY SITING PLAN FOR RCWM PROJECTS An interim holding facility for RCWM is not applicable to this project. There is no evidence to suggest that RC WMs are present on the site. Contract No: 9. PHYSICAL SECURITY PL AN FOR RCWM PROJECTS A Physical Security Plan is intended for use on RCWM projects; however, this plan is not applicable to the project. There is no evidence to suggest that RCWMs are present on the site. Contract No: W912DR- 9-1 10. REFERENCES Army (United States Department of the Army). 1998.

BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON Contractor Name: Weston Solutions, Contract -09-D-0006 ; Delivery Order Number: 0009 Project Name: Munitions and Explosives of Concern Remedial Action for Ricochet Area Munitions Response Site in State Game Lands 211, Pennsylvania 2.1 INTRODUCTION The Accident Prevention Plan ( APP) presents the minimum requirements for safety and health that must be met by site personnel working on the contract for the Munitions and Explosives of Concern (MEC) Remedial Action (RA) of the Fort Indiantown Gap (FIG) Ricochet Area Munitions Response Site (MRS) (FTIG -003-R-01). The Ricochet Area MRS is located in State Game Lands (SGL) 211 in Dauphin and Lebanon Counties, Pennsylvania. The APP does not in any way relieve site personnel, contractors, or subcontractors from responsibility for the safety and health of their personnel . Contr actors shall be required to review the site conditions and the work to be performed to determine specific safety and health requirements for their personnel. Site personnel will document in their logbook any on -site visitors. Any visitors to the site shall be required to read, understand, and comply with the approved APP. The APP is the interface with WESTON's Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) manual and is prepared to be consistent with applicable Army, federal, state, and local health and safety requirements, which include the following: 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1904, 1910 and 1926 (Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA] General Industry and Construction Standards, respectively). 40 C FR 260- 270 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] Solid Waste Standard).

WESTON Corporate Environmental Compliance, EHS Program. 2.2 SITE LOCATION AND DE SCRIPTION FIG is located in Dauphin and Lebanon Counties in south- central Pennsylvania ( Figure 2 -1). The FIG cantonment area (i.e. , support and logistical coordination area) and the FIG training corridor are separated by Blue Mountain (also called First Mountain). The Ricochet Area MRS is located in SGL 211 and is adjacent to FIG ( Figure 2 -2). FIG was established in 1931 when the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania purchased approximately 18,000 acres as a military training facility for the Pennsylvania Army National Guard (PAARNG) , with training maneuvers starting in 1933. The training area consisted of approximately 16,000 acres located northwest of the cantonment area . In 1940, the land was leased to the federal government for training U.S. Army Infantry and Armor Divisions . In 1942, the installation was put under the command of New York Port of Embarkation and served as a staging area for troops preparing for transport overseas . From 1942 to the end of World War II, the facility supported the Transportation Corps Training Center and served as a prisoner of war camp for captured German soldiers. Between 1946 and 1951, FIG was placed on deac tivated status as a federal base and served as the National Guard Training Site . FIG was returned to active status for the Korean conflict (1951- 1953) and back to deactivated status in 1953, when it was returned to the Pennsylvania Military District (URS, 2008). During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the installation served as the Reserve Officers Training Corps summer camps. FIG remained the Army's responsibility until October 1998 when the National Guard Bureau (NGB) took control as part of the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) . The site then became a National Guard and Army Reserves training center . FIG now serves as headquarters for the Pennsylvania Department of Military and Veterans Affairs and the Pennsylvania Army and Air National Guard, and as the primary training site in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for individual and collective weapons training qualification.

Direct fire and indirect fire weapon systems contributed to the MEC and munitions debris ( MD) within the Ricochet Area MRS. The Ricochet Area MRS lies within SGL 211 and is used recreationally for such activities as hunting, hiking, and bird watching. Figure 2 -2 presents the Ricochet Area MRS , and Figure 2 -3 presents a site layout plan. Based on historical information, remedial investigation ( RI) results, and WESTON' s site experience, the munitions expected at the Ricochet Area MRS include the following : 75 millimeter ( mm) projectiles (armor piercing, high -explosive, and armor AND WORK DESCRIP TION The objective of th e RA is the removal of surface and subsurface MEC with containment and controls. The task s identified include the following specific activities: Activity 1: Mobilization/Demobilization Activity 2: Grid Survey Ac tivities Activity 3: Brush C learing Activity 4: Focused S urface and Subsurface R emoval of MEC Activity 5: Digital Geophysical Mapping Activity 6: Utility Terrain Vehicle (UTV) Usage Specific activity hazard analyses (AHAs) for the above activit ies are des cribed in Section 12 .

HEALTH AND SAFETY POLICY 3.1 HEALTH AND SAFETY PO LICY WESTON personnel operate in a culture where safety, health, and protection of personnel and the environment take precedence over expediency . A fundamental premise of our Behavior - Based Safety (BBS) culture is that accidents are preventable through choosing safe , proactive behaviors. WESTON's policy on Health and Safety emphasizes several important points: WESTON has established a goal of working safely 100% of the time (employees and contractors ) with the expected outcome be ing zero incidents that result in injuries, illnesses, property damage, or environmental damage or contamination. Managers and workers accept the responsibility of a concerted and sustained effort to achieve a goal of Safety Every Minute of Every Day. Managers and workers assume a safety leadership role. Managers and workers take action for safety, coach peers in safe practices, and share experiences, successes, and failures. Workers are involved in the identification and the control of workplace hazards during work planning, work execution, and feedback activities. Management is committed to a work environment that allows free and open expression of safety concerns and where workers fear no reprisals or retaliation. Workers are the most important asset to W ESTON and are critical in the process of establishing, implementing, and observing safe work practices. 3.1.1 100% Safe- Work and Stop- Work Policy Statement For each activity and contract under which WESTON performs work, a policy is implemented clearly stating that WESTON employees have the responsibility and the right to stop or curtail any work they perceive to be unsafe (a threat to public health, the safety and health of workers, or the environment) . Employees must be free to voice concerns about safety and health without fear of reprisal, retaliation, or harassment . This policy is implemented by a clear, straightforward, contract -specific procedure as part of the WESTON Integrated Safety Management System. To support the WESTON goal of all employees and subcontractors working safely 100% of the time, managers will use every available resource to maintain safe, hazard -controlled work X:\\FIG\\CENAB- Area MRS Contract No. W912DR -09-D-0006 environments characterized by a vigorous emphasis on accident prevention. Standards, requirements, and best practices will be i mplemented to avoid accidents . Managers will ensure that employees are familiar with the standards, requirements, and best practices that pertain to their safety. WESTON managers and supervisors are held directly accountable for the health and safety of t heir employees, subcontractor activities, and other resources employed to maintain employee health and safety, and the continual communication of hazards and hazard controls to the workforce. 3.2 PROGRAM GOALS WESTON has implemented a BBS program in which empl oyees assume a safety leadership role and are responsible for the safety of coworkers, team members, and stakeholders . Employees focus on behaviors and intervention techniques to improve behavioral processes . As part of WESTON's BBS program, employees crea te high- quality connections with one another, team members, and stakeholders to foster an active, caring culture . Commitment is high, and employees help each other be Safe Every Minute of Every Day to achieve the corporate goal of Zero Accidents involving personnel and the environment. 3.3 PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The WESTON EHS Program has the following objectives: 1. EHS staff, resources, and procedures are provided as necessary and used in an efficient and cost-effective manner to establish a safe work environment for WESTON employees, subcontractors, clients, and the general public. 2. Compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations is assured, and risk is managed and minimized for employees, as well as the corporation. 3. Management involvement is establishe d and maintained within the EHS Program. 4. Clear lines of reporting, authorities, responsibilities, and performance expectations are established. 5. World -class EHS culture is attained at our places of employment, in our homes, and in our communities through the elimination of at-risk behavior. X:\\FIG\\CENAB- Area MRS Contract No. W912DR -09-D-0006 3.4 ACCIDENT EXPERIENCE GOAL The accident experience goal for this project, as well as for every WESTON project, is zero. Work shall not be performed in a manner that conflicts with the safety, health, or environmental precautions outlined in the APP or in the Site Safety and Health Plan (SSHP) ( Attachment A). Site personnel, including any WESTON subcontractors, who have the potential for exposure to site hazards, are subject to the requirements of the APP and SSHP . Personnel violating safety procedures are subject to dismissal/removal from the project site. WESTON gathers information on incidents in an electronic database that allows assessment of trends and causes of incidents . By learning from past experience, WESTON staff avoids the recurrence of incidents . This information is available to every WESTON employee and is used in training as well as in the development of APPs, SSHPs, and AHAs . The availability of this information assists in achieving WESTON's goal of working s afely Area MRS Contract No. W912DR -09-D-0006 4.

An inspector should be treated professional ly and with courtesy . The regulatory agency inspector should introduce himself/herself to the manager in charge of the operation and present credentials to verify that he/she is representing a recognized regulatory agency, such as OSHA or the Department of Transportation (DOT) . Personnel who cannot demonstrate their affiliation with a recognized regulatory agency should not be allowed access to the project site or office. Any pre -inspection conference will be attended by the SSHO, at a minimum . At that time, the scope of the inspection should clearly be described by the inspector . If the inspector has not described the scope of the inspection during the pre -inspec tion conference, the inspector should be asked to provide such a description. Prior to taking the inspector on -site or into the office, it is necessary to contact the PM, the Army National Guard ( ARNG ), PAARNG, and USACE point s of contact ( POC s), and the East Division EHS Officer . The inspector will perform the inspection, which may include a walk -through inspection of the work site or a targeted file/records review . The site or office inspection typically will end with a close -out conference during which the inspector may provide tentative findings . In some cases, the inspector may forego the close -out conference and issue a written citation after leaving the site . On occasion, inspections may require more than one day. Regulatory agency inspectors seldom issue citations during the inspection. However, if an OSHA or EPA inspector observes an imminent hazard, he/she can order a work stoppage. It is WESTON's practice to cooperate with investigations . Information that is requested should be provided; however, requests for copies of documents, safety and health plans, and training records should not be provided without first obtaining approval from WESTON's Law Department . Under no circumstances should any attempt be made to mislead the inspector. Coordination of any regulatory agency inspection is the responsibility of the SSHO, who will accompany the inspector during all stages of the inspection.

WESTON will notify OSHA within 8 hours of any fatality or single incident that results in hospitalization of three or more persons. 8.3 NOITRACK PROCEDURE In June 2009, WESTON's EHS released a new NOI reporting system . NOITrack replaces the NOI Form for reporting incidents, although the form may still be used if access to a computer is unavailable. NOITrack can be accessed on the WESTON Portal, EHS homepage. T he NOITrack information must be completed within 24 hours of the incident, accident, or near incident . The requirement and general procedure for reporting incidents has not change d; only the method of submitting them, as described below , has altered . Any one involved in the incident can complete an NOI. The NOI must be used to report ALL incidents and near -incidents. Incidents include the following: employee accidents, injuries, auto accidents, property damage/loss, utility damage, information/data breache s, security concerns/breaches, break -ins, subcontractor injuries /accidents/events, or any other liability situation or circumstance that could give rise to a claim. For example, spills/discharges resulting from the installation of equipment or systems by WESTON or WESTON subcontractors should be reported using the NOITrack system . An NOI must be submitted if something happens on a project that was not intended and could result in liability for WESTON. 8.4 ACCIDENT REVIEW Any accident that occurs while an empl oyee is driving on Company business, or operating a WESTON -owned, leased, rental, or allowance vehicle at any time will be reviewed and investigated . Drug and/or alcohol testing will be conducted in a timely manner in accordance with WESTON Drug and Alcoho l Operating Practice (05 -01-010). Accident Area MRS Contract No. W912DR -09-D-0006 intended to determine whether the accident was \"preventable\" as defined by the National Safety Council. The investigation will also include consideration of citations issued, if any, and the specifics of the accident to determine appropriate consequences, if any . Investigation may result in outcomes such as recommendation for driver training programs, changes or modifications to vehicle/equipment, suspension of driving privileges, or employee terminat ion. Typically, auto accident investigations will be coordinated on a divisional level, similar to protocols established by the divisions for other root -cause investigations . The Risk Management Department will provide input and guidance and serve as a liaison with insurance carriers, as needed.

PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 10.1 HAZARD ASSESSMENTS For the Ricochet Area MRS project, the EH S Officer and the SSHO are responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of the PPE Program. Once on-site, the SSHO is responsible for ensuring that the level of protecti on is correct for the activities. If field conditions change, an amendment will be made to the APP and SSHP to reflect the necessary PPE. 10.2 IDENTIFYING WHEN HAZARD AS SESSMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED Hazard assessments are conducted during the site walk and document review. During the initial PPE decision-making process, the APP preparer reviewed available site information and established the level of protection to be worn by site personnel for each task. Additional hazard assessments will be conducted periodically and wh en field activities or site conditions change. 10.3 IDENTIFYING HOW HAZARD AS SESSMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED The selection of the most appropriate level of protect ion depends on the following: Hazards, known or potential. - Physical hazards. - Biological hazards. - Chemical hazards. Properties such as toxicity, radioactivity, rout e of exposure, and matrix (i.e., air, soil, water) in which the contaminants are known or suspected. Type and measured concentr ations of contaminants. Potential for exposure based upon task. Based upon the initial AHAs, the APP preparer, in consultation with th e appropriate safety professionals, identified PPE for the specific tasks. The SSHO, in consultation with the appropriate safety professionals, will evaluate the AHAs and the identified PPE to determine its suitability based on the site activities and conditi ons. New or additional PPE will be selected as Accident Prevention Plan Remedial Action Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09-D-0006 X:\\FIG\\CENAB-MAMMS_RICOCHETAREAREMOVAL\\APP_SSHP\\APP_FIG_RICOCHET.DOCX 10/11/2013 10-2conditions change to ensure that employees are protected from hazards. Care will be taken to recognize the possibility of multiple and simultaneous exposur es to a variety of hazards. The levels of personal protection and the procedures specified in this plan are based on the best information available from reference documents and current site data; therefore, these recommendations represent the minimum safety and health requirements to be observed by personnel engaged in this project. Unforeseea ble site conditions or changes may warrant a reassessment of protection levels and controls st ated. Adjustments to the APP must have prior approval by the Federal Team Health and Safe ty Officer and USACE, ARNG, and PAARNG. 10.4 PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TRAINING In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910, Subpart I (Per sonal Protective Equipment), PPE will be provided, used, and maintained in a sanitary and a reliable condition.

Work activities include: Activity 1: Mobilization/Demobilization Activity 2: Grid Survey Activities Activity 3: Brush Clearing Activity 4: Focused Surface and Subsurface Removal of MEC Activity 5: Digital Geophysical Mapping Activity 6: Utility Terrain Vehicle (UTV) Usage Under each phase of work, inherently hazardous activities have been analyzed to identify controls that will protect the safety and health of personnel working at and entering the project site (see Section 12 of the APP). 2.3 CONTAMINATION AND EX POSURE POTENTIAL WESTON will ensure compliance with the requirements of EM 385-1- 1, OSHA (29 CFR 1910 and 1926), and WESTON policy requirements through formal and site -specific training programs, as well as routine inspections with follow -up compliance. Specific information pertaining to suspected physical, chemical, biological, and radiological hazards associated with the work areas, tasks, and operations is presented in the following subsections. As new data become available, this APP may need to be modified. 2.3.1 Chemical Hazards Prior sampling indicates that levels of chemical contamination would not pose a health risk. Chemicals are no t anticipated to be brought onto the project site, but in the event that tasks X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfil l Remediation Project and A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx and Health Action Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09-D-0006 X:\\FIG\\GSA - FIG.docx 10/11/2013 2-2change, the SSHP will be updated as needed. A site-specific Hazard Communication Plan is presented in Attachment 1. 2.3.2 Physical Hazards Exposure to physical hazards may include manual lifting; slips, trips, falls; heat/cold stress; hand tools (manual and power); terrain or vegetation; uneven walk ing surfaces; and weather hazards. Additional common physical hazard s include hands or fingers ca ught between objects; electric hazards; being caught in between/against or struck by an object; and traffic. Based on historical information, remedial in vestigation (RI) result s, and WESTON's site experience, the munitions anticipated at the Ricochet Area MRS include the following: 75 millimeter (mm) high explosive (HE) proj ectile, 75mm piercing HE, 155mm HE projectile, and MK-2A4 primers. 2.3.3 Biological Hazards Biological hazards include wild animals (bear, racc oons, foxes, snakes, rats, and mice); insect bites and stings (ticks, bees, mosquitoes); and poisonou s plants. A poster indicating the various types of hazardous plants and reptil es to avoid will be displayed at the site trailer. Instruction in the recognition of the animals and insects and their common nesting habits, aggressiveness, and other characteristics will be provided to site workers pr ior to field activities. Site personnel will be instructed to be alert for and to avoid wild anim als, to wear long pants and shirts and snake chaps while working in brush, and to use insect repelle nt as well as poison-ivy block and cleanser. Any site worker who is knowingly alle rgic to insect bites will be required to inform the SSHO, and to carry an allergy response kit. First-aid providers will also be trained in the proper first aid procedures for bites. Areas know n to have poisonous snakes will be discussed during daily safety briefings when appropriate. 2.3.4 Radiation Based on the review of existing information, exposure to sources of contamination or ionizing radiation is not expected. Site Safety and Health Plan Remedial Action Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09 -D-0006 2.3.4.1 Nonionizing Radiation The most likely exposure to nonionizing radiation is the sun.

MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE 7.1 MEDICAL SUPPORT FUNCTIONS Since 1980, WESTON has used a comprehensive Occupational Health Program (OHP) that complies with OSHA and USACE requirements . All personnel who enter the site when operations are being conducted must comply with a comparable OHP . All medical records are maintained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1020 . If an unforeseen hazard becomes evident during the performance of work, the SSHO will bring such hazard information to the attention of the WESTON Division EHS Officer and the USACE Contracting Officer's Representative ( COR ), both verbally and in writing for resolution as soon as possible. In the interim, the necessary action will be taken to reestablish and maintain safe working conditions . Medical certifications for site personnel are summarized in Table 5 -1. Additional personnel certifications will be available on -site for review. 7.2 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAM To comply with OSHA requirements, WESTON has designated Dr . Peter Greaney of WorkCare \u00ae to oversee the site -specific medical surveillance and OHP . Dr. Greaney is a board - certified physician in internal and occupational medicine . Dr. Greaney can be reached during regular business hours at (800) 455-6155. The purpos e of the OHP is to ensure suitable job placement of employees, to monitor the health effects of hazards encountered in the workplace, and to maintain and to promote good health through preventive measures . Medical examination criteria are established by WorkCare in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.120.

As a result, no air monitoring or air sampling will be performed. If conditions change, the AHAs and SSHP will be amended. Subsequently, WESTON would perform required monitoring to evaluate the effectiveness of prescribed PPE and to evaluate potential work exposure. Any amendment to the plan will be reviewed and approved by the Division EHS Officer and accepted by USACE , ARNG, and PAARNG. X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfill A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx and Health Action Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09 -D-0006 9. HEAT AND COLD STRESS /WEATHER Personnel will be provided information about heat and cold stress symptoms. Weather conditions will be discussed during morning safety briefings. 9.1 HEAT STRESS One of the most common types of stress that can affect field personnel is heat stress . Heat stress can be a serious hazard to workers at project sites because of the PPE required. The SSHO is responsible for evaluating the conditions, work tasks, and requirements for PPE, and for implementing the emergency response procedures . The following subsections describe the signs and symptoms, monitoring requirements, prevention and treatment procedures for heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. These requirements and procedures will be followed at all times. During hot conditions, cool drinking water will be provided for employees. Employees will be encouraged to drink at least one cup every 20 minutes and take breaks in a cooler, shady location. Personnel not acclimated to the climate or taking medications that might make them sensitive to heat should be allowed additional breaks. When possible, work should be scheduled during cooler periods of the day. Personnel working outside should use sun screen with a high SPF. 9.1.1 Heat Stress Symptoms and Treatment 9.1.1.1 Heat Rash Heat rash, also known as prickly heat, may occur in hot and humid environments where sweat is not easily removed from the surface of the skin by evaporation, and skin is aggravated by chafing clothes . When extensive or complicated by infection, heat rash can be so uncomfortable that it inh ibits sleep and impairs a worker's performance. Symptoms \u2014Mild red rash, especially on areas of the body that come into contact with protective gear. Treatment \u2014Decrease amount of time spent working in protective gear and provide body powder to help absorb m oisture and decrease chafing. Heat rash can be prevented by showering, resting in a cool place, and allowing the skin to dry. X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfill Remediation Project and Proposal \\Project \\APP_SSHP\\ Att A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx and Health Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09 -D-0006 9.1.1.2 Heat Cramps Heat cramps are caused by inadequate electrolyte intake. The individual may be receiving adequate water; however, if n ot combined with an adequate supply of electrolytes, the blood can thin to the point where it seeps into the active muscle tissue, causing cramping. Symptoms \u2014Acute painful spasms of voluntary muscles, most notably of the abdomen and extremities. Treatment \u2014Move the victim to a cool area and loosen clothing. Have the victim drink 1 to 2 cups of cool potable water or diluted commercial electrolyte solution (e.g., Gatorade\u00ae, Quench\u00ae) immediately, and then every 20 minutes thereafter until symptoms subside. Electrolyte supplements can enhance recovery; however, it is best to double the amount of water required by the dry mix package directions or to add supplemental water to the liquid form. 9.1.1.3 Heat Exhaustion Heat exhaustion is a state of weakness or exhaustion cau sed by the loss of fluids from the body . Heat exhaustion is not as dangerous as heat stroke, but if not properly managed in the field, it may lead to heat stroke. Symptoms \u2014Pale, clammy, and moist skin, profuse perspiring, and extreme weakness . Body temperature is normal, pulse is weak and rapid, and breathing is shallow . The person may have a headache, may vomit, may feel dizzy, and may be irritable or confused. Treatment \u2014Move the victim to a cool, air -conditioned or temperature -controlled area, loosen clothing, place in a position with the head lower than the feet (shock prevention), and allow the victim to rest. Consult a physician. Ensure that the victim is not nauseated or vomiting. If not nauseated or vomiting, give the victim small sips of cool water o r diluted electrolyte replenishment solution (1 to 1 dilution with water, or if mixing from powder, double the water added) . If this is tolerated, have the victim drink 1 to 2 cups of fluid immediately, and every 20 minutes thereafter until symptoms subsid e. Seek medical attention at the advice of the consulting physician. 9.1.1.4 Heat Stroke Heat stroke is an acute and dangerous reaction to heat stress caused by a failure of the body's heat regulating mechanisms, i.e., the individual's temperature control system (sweating) stops working correctly . Body temperature rises so high that brain damage and death may result if the person is not cooled quickly. X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfill Remediation Project and Proposal \\Project \\APP_SSHP\\ Att A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx and Health Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09 -D-0006 Symptoms \u2014Red, hot, dry skin (although the person may have been sweating earlier); nausea, dizziness, confusion, extremely high body temperature (i.e., 104 degrees Fahrenheit [ \u00b0F] or greater as measured with a tympanic thermometer), rapid respiratory and pulse rate, seizures or convulsions, unconsciousness or coma. Treatment \u2014Immediately call for emergency medical assistance. Remove the victim from the source of heat and cool the victim quickly . If the body temperature is not brought down quickly, permanent brain damage or death may result . Remove all PPE and as much personal clothing as decency permits . Fan the person while sponging or spraying with cool or tepid water . Apply ice packs (if available) to the back of the neck, armpits, groin area, or behind the knees . Place the victim flat on his or her back or with head and shoulders slightly elevated . If conscious, and not nauseated or vomiting, the victim may be provided sips of cool water . Do not give the victim coffee, tea, or alcoholic beverages. Emergency medical personnel will take over treatment upon arrival. 9.1.2 Heat Stress Prevention The following measures should be followed to prevent heat stress: The most important measure is to prevent heat -related il lness through adequate fluid intake. Ensure workers drink 1/2 to 1 quart of liquid per hour in high heat conditions . Most of this liquid should be water. Provide a shaded area for rest breaks. Ensure that adequate shelter is available to protect personnel against heat and direct sunlight. When possible, shade the work area. Discourage the intake of caffeinated drinks during working hours. Monitor for signs of heat stre ss. Encourage workers to maintain a good diet during these periods . In most cases, a balanced diet and lightly salted foods should help maintain the body's electrolyte balance. Bananas are especially good for maintaining the body's potassium level. If usin g commercial electrolyte mixes, double the amount of water called for in the package directions . Indications are that \"full -strength\" preparations taken under high heat stress conditions may actually decrease the body's electrolytes. Acclimate workers to s ite work conditions by slowly increasing workloads (i.e., do not begin work activities with extremely demanding tasks). Encourage workers to wear lightweight, light-colored, loose- fitting clothing. X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfill Remediation Project \\APP_SSHP\\ Att A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx and Health Action Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09 -D-0006 In extremely hot weather, conduct field activities in the early morning and evening. Maintain g ood hygienic standards through frequent showering and changes of clothing. Allow clothing to dry during rest periods. 9.1.3 Heat Stress Monitoring and Work Cycle Management When strenuous field activities are part of ongoing site work conducted in hot weather, the following guidelines should be used to monitor the body's physiological response to heat, and to manage the work cycle, even if workers are not wearing impervious clothing . These procedures should be instituted when the temperature exceeds 70 \u00baF and the tasks and risk analysis indicate an increased risk of heat stress problems . Consult the safety professional (e.g., Division EHS Officer or SSHO) if questions arise as to the need for specific heat stress monitoring . In all cases, the site personnel must be aware of the signs and symptoms of heat stress and be provided adequate rest breaks and proper aid as necessary . The SSHO will conduct heat stress monitoring . The SSHO will use a tympanic thermometer for body temperat ure and a standard thermometer for ambient temperature. NOTE: For purposes of this operating practice, a break is defined as a 15 -minute period. A physiological monitoring schedule is determined by following the steps below: Measure the air temperature wit h a standard thermometer. Estimate the fraction of sunshine by judging the percentage of time the sun is out (refer to Table 9-1). Calculate the adjusted temperature based on the following formula: Adjusted Temperature = Actual Temperature + 13 X (where X = sunshine fraction from Table 9-1 ) Using Table 9 -2, determine the physiological monitoring schedule for fit and acclimated workers for the calculated adjusted temperature. The length of the work period is governed by the frequency of physiological monitoring (Table 9-2). The length of the work period is governed by physiological parameters (heart rate and body temperature) . As noted above, the rest period will be set at 15 minutes in duration. To check the heart rate, count the radial pulse for 30 seconds at the beginning of the rest period. If X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfill Remediation Project and Proposal \\Project \\APP_SSHP\\ Att A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx and Health Action Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09 -D-0006 the heart rate exceeds 110 beats per minute, shorten the next work period by one third and maintain the same rest period . Body temperature can be checked with a tympanic thermometer after work but before the employe e drinks water . If the body temperature taken exceeds 99.7 \u00b0F, shorten the next work cycle by one third. These adjustments of the work period based on heart rate and body temperature were recommended in OSHA Technical Manual TED 01 -00-015, January 1999, Se ction III: Chapter 4, Heat Stress.

The SSHO must make decisions on the proper safety procedures . The SSHO will be responsible for implementing the pr ogram as well as attaining data on cold stress monitoring using a kestrel or other similar device, which measures wind speed, humidity, and ambient temperature . Each worker must evaluate the risk associated with his or her work and be X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfill Remediation Project and Proposal \\Project \\APP_SSHP\\ Att A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx and Health Action Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09 -D-0006 actively alert to the se hazards . Any site worker may stop work if safety procedures are not followed or if the risk is too great. Personnel working outdoors are subject to cold stress at temperatures below 40 \u00b0F. Exposure to extreme cold can cause skin injury or death if the core body temperature is unchecked and permitted to drop. Chemical -protective clothing does not provide protection against cold stress and may increase susceptibility . The following subsections describe the signs and symptoms, monitoring requirements, preve ntion, and treatment procedures for cold stress . These requirements and procedures will be followed at all times. During cold conditions, employees will be encouraged to take rewarming breaks. Any employee whose clothes become wet will immediately be wrapp ed in a blanket and will change into dry clothes as soon as possible. Thermally protective gloves should be worn and extremities will be covered by appropriate clothing. Clothing should allow sufficient ventilation or wick moisture away from the skin. Metal hand- held equipment should have a barrier between the equipment and skin. 9.2.1 Cold Stress Symptoms and Treatment 9.2.1.1 Frostbite Frostbite is the freezing of tissue and most commonly affects the toes, ears, fingers, and face . Frostbite occurs when an extremity los es heat faster than it can be replaced by the circulating blood. Frostbite may result from direct exposure to extreme cold or to cool, high wind. Damp socks or shoes may contribute to frostbite of the toes. Symptoms \u2014Cold, tingling, aching, or stinging feeling followed by numbness; skin color is red, purple, white, or very pale and is cold to the touch; blisters may be present (in severe cases). Treatment \u2014Call for emergency medical assistance. Move the victim indoors and/or away from additional exposure to cold, wet, and wind. Wrap the affected area in a soft, clean cloth (sterile, if available) . Give a warm drink (water or juices, not coffee, tea or alcohol) . Do not allow the victim to smoke . Do not rub the frostbitten part (this may cause gangrene) . Do not use ice, snow, gasoline, or anything cold on the frostbitten area . Do not use heat lamps or hot water bottles to rewarm the frostbitten area. Do not place the frostbitten area near a hot stove . Do not break blisters . After rewarming, elevate the area and protect it from further injury. X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfill Remediation Project and Proposal \\Project \\APP_SSHP\\ Att A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx and Health Hypothermia means \"low heat\" and is a potentially serious condition. Systemic hypothermia occurs when body heat loss exceeds body heat gain and the body core temperature falls below the normal 98.6 \u00baF. Although s ome hypothermia cases are caused by extremely cold temperatures, most cases develop in air temperatures between 30 \u00baF and 50 \u00baF, especially when compounded with water immersion and/or windy conditions . The victim of hypothermia may not know, or may refuse to admit, that he or she is experiencing hypothermia . All personnel must be observant for these signs for themselves and for other team members. Symptoms \u2014Cool bluish skin; uncontrollable shivering; vague, slow, movements, fumbling hands; fatigue or drowsiness . Below the critical body core temperature of 95 \u00baF, the body cannot produce enough heat by itself to recover . At this point, emergency measures must be taken to reverse the drop in core temperature . The victim may slip into unconsciousness and can die in less than 2 hours after the first signs of hypothermia are detected . Treatment and medical assistance are critical. Treatment \u2014Call for emergency medical assistance. Do n ot leave the victim alone . Prevent further heat loss by moving the person to a warmer location out of wind, wet, and cold. Remove cold, wet clothing , and replace with warm, dry clothing or wrap the victim in blankets . If the victim is conscious, provide warm liquids, candy, or sweetened foods . Carbohydrates are the food most quickly transformed into heat and energy . Do not give the victim alcohol or caffeine . Have the person move his or her arms and legs to create muscle heat . If he or she is unable to move, place warm bottles or hot packs on the arm pits, groin, neck, and head. Do not rub the arms and legs or place the person in warm water. 9.2.2 Prevention and Protection The following general guidelines are recommended for preventing or minimizing cold stress: Wear loose, layered clothing, masks, woolen scarves, and hats . Wear liners under hard hats. Protect hands with gloves or mittens. Never touch cold metal with bare hands. Wear waterproof, slip -resistant, insulated boots. Use chemical foot and hand warmers (commercially available) inside boots and gloves. X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfill Remediation Project and Proposal \\Project \\APP_SSHP\\ Att A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx and Health Action Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09 -D-0006 In extreme cold, cover the mouth and nose with wool or fur to \"pre -warm\" the air you breathe. If wearing a face protector, remove it periodically to check for frostbite. Ensure that clothing remains secure around the body, especially at the neck and waist. If required to wear chemical protective clothing, remember that it generally does not afford protection against cold stress . In many instances, chemical protective clothing increases susceptibility . Dress ca refully if both chemical protection and thermal insulation are required. Remove outer layers to avoid overheating , and remove clothing soaked with perspiration; replace layers to avoid becoming chilled. Keep clothes dry by wearing water -resistant and wind- resistant clothing and outerwear. Wear clothing that will \"breathe\" or allow water vapor to escape. Eat well -balanced meals, ensure adequate intake of liquids and avoid alcoholic beverages . Drink warm, sweet beverages and soups . Limit the intake of caffein ated drinks due to the diuretic and circulatory effects. Use available warm shelters and implement work -rest schedules. If warm shelters are not available, use cars/vehicles as shelter s from the cold . (Ensure that tailpipes are not covered by heavy snowfal l). Use radiant heaters to provide warmth (if using propane heaters ensure adequate ventilation to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning). Monitor yourself and others for changes in physical and mental condition. Use the buddy system or supervision to ensure constant protective observation. If heavy work must be done, resulting in sweating/wet clothing, take rest periods in heated shelters and change into dry clothing as necessary. New employees should not work full -time in the cold during the first days of emplo yment until they become accustomed to the working conditions and the use of required protective clothing. Include the weight and bulkiness of clothing in estimating the required work performance and weights to be lifted by the worker. Arrange the work in s uch a way that sitting or standing still for long periods is minimized. X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfill Remediation Project and Proposal \\Project \\APP_SSHP\\ Att A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx and Health Action Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09 -D-0006 Perform work protected from drafts to the greatest extent possible . If possible, shield the work area from wind. Table 9 -3 and Table 9-4 should be consulted to adjust working schedules for wind chill conditions based on equivalent chill temperature (ECT) . These tables are guidelines only; ambient temperatures and wind conditions should be monitored frequently, and work schedules adjusted as required . If workers show signs or symptoms of cold stress, the work schedule must be adjusted, as required. 9.2.3 Work/Warming Regimen Work should be performed during the warmest part of the day . If work is performed continuously in cold or winter conditions or where rain or cool winds are expected, provid e heated warming shelters, tents, cabins, or break rooms nearby . Encourage workers to use the shelter at regular intervals, depending on the severity of the cold exposure . Table 9 -4, Cold Work/ Warm -up Schedule for 4- Hour Shifts, provides guidance for working in severe cold weather . The onset of heavy shivering and/or the feeling of excessive fatigue, drowsiness, irritability, or euphoria indicate the need to immediately return to the shelter . Pain, numbness, or tingling in the extremities is indication of t he need to immediately return to the shelter . When entering the heated shelter, the outer layer of clothing should be removed and the remainder of the clothing loosened to permit sweat evaporation, or the worker should change into dry clothing. Never retur n to work in wet clothing.

In the event that a storm threatens the area through observation of a storm system (lightning observation and thunder), all field work will be halted and weather service bulletins and civil defense messages will be monitored on local radio or through cell phone applications . The SSHO will determine through visual observations and weather updates (gathered through the radio or cell phone) when it is necessary to halt work and when to re -start field activities, which include observing the \"30 -30\" rule that states: X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfill Remediation A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx and Health Action Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09 -D-0006 If you see lightning and thunder is heard within 30 seconds (approximately 6 miles), seek shelter. If you hear thunder, but did not see the lightning, assume that lightning is within 6 miles and seek shelter. Remain in the shelter for 30 minutes following the last lightning strike. When a tornado warning goes into effect, the following actions will be taken: If in your vehicle: Leave your vehicle and seek shelter in a sturdy building . As a last resort, seek shelter in a ditch or culvert . In buildings: Take shelter in an interior hallway on a lower floor . A closet, bathroom, or other small room with short, stout walls will give some protection from collapse and flying debris . Otherwise, get under heavy furniture and stay away from the windows. Out in open country: Seek inside shelter immediately . If a tornado approaches, lie flat in the nearest depression, such as a ditch or culvert, and cover your head with your arms. Additionally, when wind speed exceeds 40 mph, the following actions wil l be taken: Follow manufacturer instructions in assessing the limitations associated with field equipment. Shut down outdoor activities involving work at elevation. Move mobile items stored outside to indoor locations. Secure any items that cannot be moved inside. Be careful opening exterior doors. Stay away from power lines. Be cautious about downed power lines, tree limbs, and debris on roads. If weather remains unstable for more than 1 hour, the SSHO will monitor weather bulletins to further assess chang ing conditions.

STANDARD OPERATING SAFETY PROCEDURES, EN GINEERING CONTROLS, AND WORK P RACTICES Using common sense, operating under the \"buddy system\" (or two- person rule), and following safe practices can reduce the hazards of normal project activities . The general site safety procedures contained in the WESTON Corporate EHS Program field operating procedures guide (which will be on- site) will be followed, and no running or horsepl ay will be allowed at the site. 10.1 SITE RULES/PROHIBITIONS 10.1.1 Buddy System All wor k at the Ric ochet Area MRS will be performed using the buddy system . Team members will keep in contact with each other at all times . Team members will be made aware of any slip, trip, and lifting hazards along with any potential exposure to chemical substances, heat or cold stress, and general hazards within their work area. 10.1.2 Designated Eating/Break Areas Eating and break areas will be located away from the active work area. No food or beverages will be allowed in any work environments. 10.1.3 Designated Smoking Ar eas All regulations governing approved areas for smoking and spark generation will be strictly followed. Smoking is prohibited except in designated smoking areas . The SSHO will identify designated smoking areas . Discarding tobacco materials other than into designated tobacco receptacles is considered littering and is subject to fines. 10.2 WORK PERMITS No facility work permits are associated with this project. 10.3 MATERIAL HANDLING PR OCEDURES No hazardous material handling will occur as part of these activities. X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfill Remediation Project and Proposal \\Project \\APP_SSHP\\ Att A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx and Health Action Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09 -D-0006 10.4 SPILLS No spills are anticipated for this project. No hazardous substances will be taken on -site. 10.5 DRUM/CONTAINER TANK HANDLING No drums or container handling will be part of this project. 10.6 DRUG AWARENESS AND DRUG -FREE WORKPLACE WESTON fully supports all aspect s of the Drug -Free Workplace Act of 1988. As such, WESTON has implemented Operating Practice 05 -01-010, Drug- Free Workplace. This practice is in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 252.223-7004. Strict disciplinary actions are enforced for any violation of WESTON's Drug -Free Workplace policy . All WESTON employees, as a condition of employment, have documented understanding and receipt of this policy. While on duty , employees will not use or be under the influence of alcohol, narcoti cs, intoxicants, or similar mind -altering substances . Employees found to be under the influence of or consuming such substances will be immediately removed from the job site . Contractors will also adhere to WESTON's drug- free workplace requirements. Any em ployee under a physician's treatment and taking prescribed narcotics or any medication, including over -the-counter medication, that may prevent a person from being ready, willing, and able to safely perform his/her duties will provide a medical clearance statement to his/her supervisor from the attending physician. WESTON's Operating Practice emphasizes supervisor training, a provision for self -referral to treatment, and maximum respect for individual confidentiality as well as a provision for identifying a nd dealing with illegal drug users, including testing . WESTON's practice also provides for education, counseling, rehabilitation, and coordination with available community resources.

If extended periods of working long hours are required, the SSHO will monitor employees for outward signs of fatigue . Employee rotations may need to be adjusted to allow for individual differences in how fatigue -related stress is handled and for employee-specific roles on the project. While working extended hours, employee travel time to and from work will be minimized to allow for sufficient rest and should be taken into account in determining limits on hours per day and per week . Group transportation to and from the work location and lodging will be used to address this situation . Consideration should be given to \"awake\" time and not just the hours logged on a time sheet. 10.7.2 Fatigue Symptoms Intrinsic Sympt oms Physical \u2014Frequent, unexplainable headaches, muscle aches and pains, breathing difficulties, blurred/double vision, and/or burning urination. Mental \u2014Difficulty focusing attention, distracted easily, depression, impaired judgment, and/or poor visual perception. Extrinsic Symptoms Physical \u2014Degraded motor skills, tenseness and tremors, intolerant/irritable, increased reaction time, and/or social withdrawal. Mental \u2014Absentmindedness, poor short -term memory, lack of interest and drive, confusion and fearfulness, slow startle response, worry, and /or anxiety . 10.7.3 Fatigue Management WESTON employees and subcontractors should not work in excess of 84 hours per week (12 hours/day - 7 days/week) unless approved by the Project Manager . The Division and Corporate EHS commu nities, as well as the local Operations/Resource Manager, are available to support the Project Manager's decision process.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE A ND CONTINGENCY PROCE DURES 15.1 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Site evacuation route and predetermined meeting location map will be developed and posted prior to m obilization . The evacuation route and predetermined meeting location map will be reviewed with all employees prior to the start of work and prior to the start of each new task. Within a few days of the startup of work, a drill will be run for the emergency response plan. WESTON has evaluated the emergency medical services . The SSHO will have a roster of individuals on-site so that they can be accounted for in the event of an emergency. 15.2 PERSONNEL AND LINES OF AUTHORITY FOR EME RGENCY SITUATIONS Fire and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) will provide support as necessary . The SSHO will be appointed as an Emergency Coordinator (EC), and a system will be implemented to provide a common framework within which people can work together effectively. 15.3 CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES FOR EMERGENCY RECOGNITION AND SITE EVACUATION 15.3.1 Medical Emergency and Personal Injury The first worker who notices that a medical emergency or personal injury has occurred will immediately make a subjective decision whether the emergency is life- threat ening and/or otherwise serious and will then proceed as described in the following subsections . Because no contaminants of concern exist on- site, emergency decontamination of personnel will not be required. 15.3.1.1 Life-Threatening and/or Otherwise Serious Inciden t If a life -threatening incident occurs, emergency medical assistance will be immediately requested . If an apparent life- threatening and/or otherwise serious incident has occurred, the first person who identifies the situation will summon the SSHO or Site Manager . The SSHO or Site Manager, whoever arrives first, will assume the role of EC . The EC will be apprised of the situation and told where the injured person(s) is/are located. As the EC proceeds to the accident 15-1 X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfill Remediation Project and Proposal \\Projec t\\APP_SSHP\\ Att A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx 9/27/2013 Site Safety and Health Plan Remedial Action Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09 -D-0006 scene, communications channels will be opened and kept on standby until the EC has surveyed the scene and performed a primary survey of the injured person. The EC will determine whether emergency assistance should be summoned and what information must be relayed, and will provide emergency action principles that are consistent with the injury . The EC will appoint a staff person or persons who will meet the emergency responders and take them quickly to the injured person. If necessary, decontamination of the individual will be performed at the dire ction of the EC. 15.3.2 Non-Life-Thre atening Incident If it is determined that no threat to life is present, the worker will assist the injured person to a safe location and contact the SSHO . The injured person will then be treated and monitored in accordance wit h standard first -aid procedures and this SSHP. 15.3.3 Worker Injury or Illness The SSHO will be responsible for monitoring the general health of site workers . Site illnesses, conditions, or injuries that can be expected given the working conditions include hypothermia, frostbite, construction-related injuries, insect bites, and injuries caused by slips, trips, and falls. These conditions will be prevented by properly training site workers in the appropriate use of health and safety equipment, dressing appropriately, monitoring the breathing zone atmosphere when necessary, and maintaining good housekeeping procedures. The specific response to an injury or illness will depend on its type and severity, but in general, first aid will be administered in the field by the SSHO, who will be certified in first aid and CPR . The worker may then be transported to the hospital designated in this SSHP (see Table 15-1 and Figures 15 -1 and 15-2 for hospital information and directions ). General guidelines for first aid are as follow s: For minor injuries, routine first-aid procedures will be used and documented. For major injuries, an ambulance will be called immediately and the appropriate first aid administered while awaiting arrival of the ambulance. Trained personnel will use appr oved measures to administer treatment. 15-2 X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfill Remediation Project and Proposal \\Projec t\\APP_SSHP\\ Att A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx 9/27/2013 Site Safety and Health Plan Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09 -D-0006 15.3.4 Emergency Response During an emergency, the following actions will be taken, with some actions conducted concurrently.

Do not hang up until told to do so by the operator, or allow the 15-9 X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfill Remediation Project and Proposal \\Project \\APP_SSHP\\ Att A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx 9/27/2013 Site Safety and Health Plan Remedial Action Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09 -D-0006 operator to hang up first . Upon completion of the emergency phase, comply with incident notification procedures. If the fire is small and manageable with fire -extinguishing equipment at hand, and you are trained in the use of this equipment, you may make the decision to use this equipment while waiting for advanced assistance. Never place yourself in danger, always have a plan for escape, and never attempt to fight a fire if there are any doubts about the type of fire or your ability to successfully fight the fire . Never allow the fire to get between you and your escape route. 15.5.1 Fire Extinguishing Equipment Fire extinguishing equipment that meets 29 CFR Part 1926, Subpart F, will be on hand and ready for use to control fires. The following procedures will be followed: 1. Flammable and Combustible Materials (liquids, gases): Flammable materials mus t be properly labeled, stored, handled, and used. No smoking or use of open flame -producing devices within 50 feet of flammable and combustible materials. Obtain MSDSs for all flammable materials in use and ensure all personnel are aware of hazards. Label all containers with contents, the word \"Flammable\", and in accordance with hazard communication requirements. Store materials in well- ventilated areas that are free of igni tion sources and flame or sparks. Ensure that incompatible materials are stored in remote locations from each other (e.g., keep flammables from oxidizers). Limit quantities to minimum required. Store cylinders in upright and secure positions. Bond and ground containers as (and where) necessary. Use proper storage cabinets for flammable and combustible materials . Contact EHS Staff for assistance. Use only approved containers. Use and dispense only in well- ventilated areas. 2. Combustible Materials (solids): Solid combustible materials include wood, paper, and cloth. Proper housekeeping reduces concerns for combustion of these materials . Use proper receptacles for disposal, and dispose of solid combustible materials routinely. 15-10 X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfill Remediation Project \\Project \\APP_SSHP\\ Att A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx 9/27/2013 Site Safety and Health Plan Remedial Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09 -D-0006 3. Oxidizers: An oxidizer is a substanc e that increases the flammability of materials, allowing them to burn more easily . Examples include pure oxygen, chlorine, and ammonium nitrate . Store oxidizers in a remote location from flammable and combustible materials. 4. Electric Appliances: Do not use electric appliances near flammable or combustible materials . Never place an appliance on an unstable surface . Use only Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. (UL ) - or Factory Mutual Research Corp. (FM) -approved appliances . Follow the manufacturer's recommendatio ns or requirements for us e and maintenance. 5. Smoking: Smoking is prohibited indoors . Smoking is allowed only in outdoor, designated areas . Smokers are to maintain smoking areas in a clean and safe condition. Ensure that receptacles for disposal of cigarettes and other smoking materials are appropriately constructed, free of combustible debris, and, when necessary, are cool before emptying into waste receptacles. 6. Housekeeping: Personnel are responsible for keeping work areas free of combustible materials and debris. Weeds and grass must be properly maintained to limit potential fire hazard. The SSHO will document and inspect all project fire extinguishers on a monthly basis. 15.6 WILD FIRES 15.6.1 Prevention Site personnel should practice smart fire safety habits and watch out for hazardous conditions . If conditions are dry, wild fires can pose a threat \u2014not only because there is plenty of fuel to burn, but also because rural areas and remote locations often do not have easy access for firefighters . There also is a chance t hat embers from a fire a mile or more away may fall onto nearby vegetation and cause them to catch fire. The following preventive measures will be observed: Smoke only in designated areas. Avoid driving through high grass or areas where vehicle exhaust or hot engine surfaces could cause fires. Keep a fire extinguisher handy. Be extra cautious during the dry season and observe warnings and prohibitions established by the Forestry Service or other agencies. Be aware of wild fires in neighboring areas. 15-11 X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfill Remediation Project and Proposal \\Project \\APP_SSHP\\ Att A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx 9/27/2013 Site Safety and Health Plan Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09 -D-0006 15.6.2 Aware ness and Response Wild fires can spread quickly and without warning . A subtle shift in the wind could send the flames in your direction even though authorities may have deemed your area safe. Make sure you have a plan in place: Be aware of wild fires in neig hboring areas. Do not attempt to fight forest fires . If fire or smoke is observed, notify all site personnel, initiate evacuation, and report the fire to the designated emergency agencies. Designate a pl ace to meet if there is a fire. Identify multiple pla ces you could evacuate to, such as a motel outside the danger zone. If you are driving: Roll up your windows and close your air vents. Drive slowly and turn on your headlights. Do not drive through heavy smoke. 15.7 MEDICAL SUPPORT It is very easy to panic, but if you remain calm and prepare for emergency situations, you will increase your chances of evacuating safely. 15.7.1 On-Site Medical S upport In the event specialized/elevated care is necessary, either WESTON or the local on -call ambulance service will transport the injured person to the hospital . The local Fire and EMS Department can be notified of emergency situations by using the telephone numbers listed in Table 15-1. There will be fewer than 100 people on- site; therefore, WESTON will not be providing on- site medical support. A first aid kit complying with the criteria contained in ANSI Z308.1 -2009 will be provided on- site. For minor injuries, routine first aid procedures will be used and documented. For major injuries, an ambulance will be called immediately , and the appropriate first aid administered while awaiting the arrival of the ambulance. 15-12 X:\\FIG\\GSA - Landfill Remediation Project and Proposal \\Project \\APP_SSHP\\ Att A SSHP\\ SSHP FIG.docx 9/27/2013 Site Safety and Health Plan Remedial Action Ricochet Area MRS Contract No. W912DR-09 -D-0006 Trained personnel will use approved measures for treatment based on the training they have received. 15.7.2 Off-Site Medical Support WESTON has contacted the local emergenc y resources to verify their availability and ability to respond to any emergencies encountered. 15.7.3 Directions and Map to Nearest Hospital The appropriate emergency vehicle will travel to the closest emergency hospital to the site, which is the Hershey Medical Center , located at 500 University Drive , Hershey , PA (see Figure 15-1) . Figure 15 -1 shows the route to the hospital from the Ricochet Area MRS (the driving distance is approximately 18 miles and the driving time is approximately 35 minutes) .

TOXICOLOGICAL DATA ORAL (LD50: greater than 2000 mg/kg). ---Based on testing of similar products and/or the components. DERMAL TOXICITY (RABBITS): Practically non- toxic (LD50: greater than 2000 mg/kg). ---Based on testing of similar products and/or the components. INHALATION TOXICITY (RATS): Practically non- toxic (LC50: greater than 5 mg/l). ---Based on testing of similar products and/or the components. EYE IRRITATION (RABBITS): Practically non- irritating. (Draize score: greater than 6 but 15 or less). ---Based on testing of similar products and/or the components. SKIN IRRITATION (RABBITS): Practically non- irritating. (Primary Irritation Index: greater than 0.5 but less than 3). ---Based on testing of similar products and/or the components. ---SUBCHRONIC TOXICOLOGY (SUMMARY)--- Repeated dermal application of middle distillates, heating oils and diesel oils to rabbits for 2- 4 weeks at up to 1 gm/kg resulted in strong to severe skin irritation with some weight loss at the higher dose. Toxic effects ranging from weight loss to mortality was observed in rabbits treated repeatedly with very high doses (6 gm/kg) of these oils. Repeated inhalation exposure of middle distillate and diesel vapor and aerosol to rats for 2- 4 weeks at up to 6 mg/l resulted in respiratory tract irritation, lung changes/infiltration/accumulation, and some reduction in lung function. ---REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY (SUMMARY)--- Diesel fuel vapors were tested in an inhalation teratology (developmental toxicity) study in rats and when only minimal maternal toxicity was observed, no fetotoxic or developmental effects were observed. A developmental toxicity study of dermally applied middle distillates did indicate fetotoxicity (reduced litter size, litter weight, increased resorptions) at doses that also caused significant maternal toxicity. ---CHRONIC TOXICOLOGY (SUMMARY)--- Diesel fuel, heating oil and middle distillates have been shown to be carcinogenic in lifetime mouse skin painting bioassays. While in some cases, the tumor incidence is low in the test populations and possibly associated with skin irritation, concurrent evidence from short- term predicative tests (Modified Ames) does indicate some level of mutagenic activity associated with levels of polycylic aromatic compounds in certain test samples. ---SENSITIZATION (SUMMARY)--- Middle distillate oils were not skin sensitizers when tested in a Modified Buehler Guinea Pig Sensitization Assay. ---OTHER TOXICOLOGY DATA--- Overexposure to diesel exhaust fumes may result in eye irritation, headaches, nausea, and respiratory irritation. Animal studies involving lifetime exposure to high levels of diesel exhaust have produced variable results, with some studies indicating a potential for lung cancer. Limited evidence from epidemiological studies suggest an association between long- term occupational exposure to diesel engine emissions and lung cancer. Diesel engine exhaust typically consists of gases and particulates, including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen compounds, oxides of sulfur, and hydrocarbons. Diesel exhaust composition will vary with fuel, engine type, load cycle, engine maintenance, tuning and exhaust gas treatment. Use of adequate ventilation and/or respiratory protection in the presence of diesel exhaust is recommended to minimize exposures. This product contains ethylbenzene. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has evaluated ethylbenzene and classified it as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) based on sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity in experimental animals, but inadequate evidence for cancer in exposed humans. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ENVIRONMENTAL FATE AND EFFECTS: In the absence of specific environmental data for this product, this assessment is based on information for representative substances. ECOTOXICITY: Based on test results for similar products, this substance may be toxic to aquatic organisms such as algae and daphnia (EL50/ IrL50 =1- 10 mg/L). This substance has also been shown to be toxic to specific fish species (LL50 = 1- 10 mg/L for rainbow trout, Atlantic silverside). MOBILITY: Dissolution of the higher molecular weight hydrocarbon components in water will be limited, but losses through sediment adsorption may be significant. PERSISTENCE AND DEGRADABILITY: The majority of the components in this product are expected to be inherently biodegradable. The consitituents of diesel fuels/heating oil which are volatilized will photodegrade in the atmosphere. The less volatile, more water-soluble components which are aromatic hydrocarbons will also undergo aqueous photodegradation. BIOACCUMULATIVE POTENTIAL: Not established. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 13.

WESTON workers expected to administer first aid must have a basic understanding of bloodborne pathogens in order to protect themselves effectively from any hazards. At a minimum, this Bloodborne Pathogen ECP for First Aid Providers will be on site WESTON personnel may deliver First Aid and CPR in a nonclinical setting. First Aid and CPR duties are often performed in uncontrolled environments, which, due to a lack of time and other factors, do not allow for application of a complex decision- making process to the emergency at hand. This ECP is intended to assist personnel in making decisions concerning the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and resuscitation equipment, as well as for decontamination, labeling, containerizing and disposal procedures. Information Program Identification and assessment of risk from exposure to biological hazards is conducted as part of the development of the APP and SSHP . This ECP deals with forms of infection that are of concern to workers who can come in contact with bodily fluids associated with blood. WESTON training programs provide information on bloodborne pathogens and the Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens Standard to all field personnel with special emphasis on those employees who are certified and called upon to perform First Aid. Exposure Control This ECP is designed to eliminate or minimize employee exposure to bloodborne pathogens through information and training, use of PPE, safe handling procedures, decontamination, and proper disposal methods. Exposure Determination Employees certified in First Aid and CPR may be at risk from bloodborne pathogens when these services are rendered. Attachment 1 identifies tasks in which occu pational exposure may occur, potential contact, and required protective measures for First Aid providers. METHODS OF COMPLIANCE Universal Precautions When treating a victim for an injury, conducting CPR, or handling potentially infectious waste, the use of universal precautions is the recommended approach to infection control. Universal precautions assume all human blood and certain human body fluids are infectious for HIV, HBV and other bloodborne pathogens. Other body substances, including feces, urine, or vomit are not included, unless they contain visible blood. Under circumstances in which differentiation between body fluid types is difficult or impossible, all body fluids shall be considered potentially infectious materials. X:\\FIG\\CENAB -MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval \\APP_SSHP\\ Att F BBP \\AttF_BBP_ExpControlPlan.docx 9/27/2013 Work Practice Controls Work practice controls reduce the likelihood of exposure by formalizing the manner in which a task is performed. All first aid procedures involving blood or other potentially infectious materials shall be performed in a manner that minimizes splashing, spraying, spattering, and generation of droplets of these substances. Mouth suctioning of blood or other infectious materials is prohibited. When handling sharps such as needles used for bee stings or diabetes, do not recap, purposely bend, break by hand, remove from disposable syringes, or otherwise manipulate by hand. As soon as possible after use, contaminated sharps are to be placed in puncture proof/leak proof containers until they can be disposed. Broken glassware which may be contaminated shall not b e picked up directly with the hands unless gloves are used to protect the hands against cuts. It is best to use mechanical means, such as a brush and dust pan then place contaminated broken glass in a puncture proof/leak proof container. When handling red bag waste, hold the top end of the bag rather than the bottom. Containers of potentially infectious waste should be labeled with a biohazard label. All PPE should be inspected prior to use. PPE should not be worn if the PPE barrier is compromised. Hands an d other skin surfaces should be washed immediately and thoroughly if contaminated with blood, other body fluids to which universal precautions apply, or their potentially contaminated articles. Hands should always be washed after gloves are removed even if the gloves appear intact. Where hand washing facilities are not readily accessible, an antiseptic hand cleaner along with clean cloth/paper towels or antiseptic towelettes should be used. When antiseptic hand cleaners or towelettes are used hands shall be washed with soap and running water as soon as feasible. Engineering Controls Engineering controls isolate or remove the bloodborne pathogen hazard from the workplace. Proper containerizing, labeling and disposal of contaminated items are required for all potentially infectious waste. Minimizing needle sticks by placing them in a puncture proof container. Limiting access or close off areas which contain potentially infectious materials. Administrative Controls Administrative controls reduce or eliminate blo odborne pathogen hazards from the workplace by program development (i.e., ECP), auditing to ensure these programs are in place and implemented, and providing information and training. X:\\FIG\\CENAB -MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval \\APP_SSHP\\ Att F BBP \\AttF_BBP_ExpControlPlan.docx 9/27/2013 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) PPE is specialized clothing or equipment worn by an employee for protection against a hazard. Attachment 1 provides examples of recommendations for PPE in the nonclinical setting; the list is not intended to be all- inclusive. First-aid kits will be supplemented with bloodborne pathogen kits or supplies and will be readily accessible at all times. If the chance of being exposed to blood is high, the caregiver should put on protective attire before beginning CPR or First Aid. Protective barriers should be used in accordance with the level of exposure encountered. Under rare or extraordinary circumstances, a responding employee may decide, based on his or her judgment, that use of PPE would prevent delivery of care or pose an increased hazard to safety of the employee or co -worker. When this judgment has been made, an investigation of the event will be initiated and documented in order to determine what changes in procedures or protective equipment is needed. Resuscitation Equipment No transmission of HBV or HIV infection during mouth to mouth resuscitation has been documented. However, because of the risk of salivary transmission of other infectious diseases and the theoretical risk of HIV and HBV transmission during artificial ventilation of trauma victims, disposable mouth to mouth resuscitatio n masks (one- way valve type only) should be used. These devices are designed to isolate emergency response personnel from contact with victim's blood and blood- contaminated saliva, respiratory secretions, and vomit. Disposable resuscitation equipment and d evices should be disposed of once they have been used. Decontamination and Disposal All PPE will be removed prior to leaving a contaminated area and secured properly for decontamination or proper disposal. Decontamination uses physical or chemical means to remove, inactivate, or destroy bloodborne pathogens on a surface or item to the point where they are no longer capable of transmitting infectious particles and the surface or item is rendered safe for handling, use, or disposal. All spills of blood and blood- contaminated fluids should be promptly cleaned up. The area should be decontaminated with a commercial disinfectant solution or a 1:100 solution of household bleach. Soiled cleaning equipment should be cleaned and decontaminated with the disinfectant s olution. If a victim's clothes become soiled with blood during First Aid or CPR, the soiled material (i.e., clothes, resuscitation equipment or disposable towels) should be placed in a red or orange plastic bag. If possible this bag should accompany the victim to the hospital or ambulance. Where on- site emergency care is given and additional medical treatment is not likely, soiled material should be placed in a red or orange plastic bag and then pick -up should be arranged by a local medical waste disposal company. Containers must be identified prior to transport or pick-up. Any questions regarding the disposal or management of soiled garments or materials should be directed to Federal Team Health and Safety Officer or Division Environmental Health and Safety Officer. Containerizing The potentially contaminated materials and sharps container generated from giving First Aid and CPR will be placed in a red or orange container/bag. When PPE is removed it shall be placed in an appropriate designated area for containerization. If the outside contamination of the primary container occurs, the primary container shall be placed within a second container which prevents leakage during handling processing storage, transport or shipping and is labeled or color coded. X:\\FIG\\CENAB -MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval \\APP_SSHP\\ Att F BBP \\AttF_BBP_ExpControlPlan.docx 9/27/2013 Sharps such as needles used for bee stings or diabetes should be placed in a puncture proof/leak proof color coded or labeled container. If other contents could puncture the primary container, the primary container shall be placed within a secondary contai ner which is puncture resistant. The liquid generated from the decontamination process should be contained in a leak proof container until a local medical waste disposal company can provide information on proper disposal based on local, state and federal regulations. Labeling and Hazard Communication Biohazard warning labels required by the Standard [29 CFR 1910.1030(g)(1)(i)(B)] must be attached to containers of regulated wastes or other containers of potentially infectious materials during storage, transp ort or shipment. Red or orange bags may be substituted for labeling requirements, otherwise, a biohazard label with lettering or symbols should be affixed to the outside of each bag or container generated. Consequently, any container so labeled or any red or orange bagged waste or materials shall be considered to contain either blood or other infectious material. Incident Reporting When an employee gives First Aid or CPR, or is potentially exposed to a bloodborne pathogen, a Notification of Incident (NOI) R eport must be completed. The report must indicate \"Potential Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens Vaccination and Post -Exposure Evaluation and Follow-up The pre- work Hepatitis B Vaccination for First Aid providers is not required, it will therefore, be offered post-exposure. Hepatitis B vaccines are effective in preventing hepatitis B following a documented exposure when given within 1 week after HBV exposure. The vaccine may be more effective when combined with HBIG, a preparation of immune globulin with high levels of antibody to HBV (anti -HBs). The U.S. Public Health Service and Center for Disease Control guidelines should be accessed for current information. Upon suspicion or verification of exposure to blood or infectious materials, Hepatitis vaccine will be made available to the exposed individual(s) at no cost to the employee. The employee will immediately be referred to WESTON's Occupational Medical Consultant (OMC) for counseling and management. Upon learning of exposure to a source or source individual found to be positive for HBV or HIV, WESTON's OMC will provide direction on case management. The OMC, after discussion of the exposure situation with the medical clinic or hospital where the victim was evaluated and treated for injury, will determine whether the exposed employee should be tested for HBV or HIV prior to the status of the source being known (or in the case where the source is unknown). HBV and HIV testing of the source individual should be done at the local offices' medical clinic or at the hospital where the victim was treated for injury. Local laws may apply for testing source individuals in situations where consent cannot be obtained because the source refuses testing or cannot be identified (i.e., an unconscious patient). If the job location does not allow access to the local offices' medical clinic then a new WESTON OMC will be consulted for guidance. The alternate clinic/hospital must offer pretest counseling, post test counseling and referral for treatment. Consult with WESTON's OMC to d etermine if the exposed employee should be given the HBV post - exposure vaccination. Collection and testing of blood for HBV and HIV serological status shall be performed as soon as feasible on the exposed employee's blood (after consent) where the source is found to be positive for HIV or HBV. Results of the source individual's testing shall be made available to the exposed employee, and the employee shall be informed by the Medical Safety Officer of applicable laws and regulations concerning X:\\FIG\\CENAB -MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval \\APP_SSHP\\ Att F BBP \\AttF_BBP_ExpControlPlan.docx 9/27/2013 disclosure of the identity and infectious status of the source individual. When the source individual is already known to be infected with HBV or HIV testing of the source individual known HBV or HIV status need not be repeated (Center for Disease Control, 1985). If the source of the exposure is a needle stick or bloodstained material (i.e., blood stained material contacted an open wound on a field team member) the source should be placed in an appropriate container (i.e., sharps container for needles and red bag for blood tainted material). The container should be given to the WESTON medical clinic for analysis. If the source is found to be HBV or HIV positive, the incident report must be updated to change the status from suspected to confirmed exposure. At this point the NOI Report will be placed in a limited control access portion of incident filing system to maintain confidentiality. Human Immunodeficiency Virus Post Exposure Management For any exposure to a source or source individual who has AIDS, who is found to be positive for HIV infection or who refuses testing, the worker should be counseled regarding the risk of infection and evaluated clinically and serologically for evidence for the HIV infection as soon as possible after the exposure. WESTON's OMC will provide direction on the case management. If the source individual was tested and found to be seronegative, follow-up will be determined by WESTON's OMC. If the source or source individual cannot be identified, decisions regarding appropriate follow-up should be individualized. Serological testing will be made available to all workers who may be concerned they have been infected with HIV through an occupational exposure. WESTON's OMC will provide direction on the case management. Communication of Hazards to Employees Training Schedule WESTON ensures that employees, who are certified to provide First Aid and CPR, are trained in all components of the bloodborne pathogen standard upon assignment and at the annual refresher training. All First Aid providers must be aware of task modifications or procedure changes which might affect occupational exposure. Training Contents A training sign -up sheet will be completed to include course title, date, attendees' names, signatures, job classifications, instructor's name, and duration of the class. Training content will include the following information: Where an accessible copy of the regulatory text and the WESTON's ECP can be found. An explanation of WESTON's ECP and the means by which employees can obtain a copy of the written plan. A general explanation of the epidemiology and symptoms of bloodborne diseases. An explanation of the appropriate methods for recognizing tasks and other activities that may involve exposure to blood and other potentially infectious materials. An explanation of the use and limitations of methods that will prevent or reduce exposure including appropriate engineering controls, work practices, and PPE. Information on the types, proper use, location, removal, handling, decontamination and disposal of PPE. X:\\FIG\\CENAB -MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval \\APP_SSHP\\ Att F BBP \\AttF_BBP_ExpControlPlan.docx 9/27/2013 An explanation of the basis for selection of PPE. Information on the Hepatitis B vaccine (or any new vaccines), including information on its efficacy, safety, method of administration, the benefits of being vaccinated. An explanation of the procedure to follow if an exposure incident occurs, including the method of reporting the incident and the medical follow- up that will be made available. Information on the post-exposure evaluation and follow-up that WESTON is required to provide for the employee following an exposure incident. An explanation of the signs and labels and/or color coding for disposal of infectious materials. An opportunity for interactive questions and answers with the person conducting the training session. Recordkeeping When an e mployee gives First Aid or CPR and in doing so becomes subject to this ECP, he/she will verbally report the incident within 1 hour and complete a WESTON NOI Report within 24 hours . As part of a medical record, the circumstances of exposure will be kept con fidential. Relevant information includes the activities in which the worker was engaged at the time of exposure, the extent to which appropriate work practices and PPE were used, and a description of the source of exposure (USHHS and NIOSH, 1989). When the source is tested for HIV or HBV, the incident report is updated and placed in a confidential file.

The MRS is a 3,262- acre section of Pennsylvania State Game Lands (SGL) 211, which is owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and managed by the Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC) ( Figure A -1). The Ricochet Area MRS lies within East Hanover Township in Dauphin County and Cold Spring Township in Lebanon County and is immediately adjacent to the Fort Indiantown Gap (FI G) Military Reservation ( Figure A -2). This removal action is being performed under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), and is part of the overall remedial action process. Additional removal responses may be dictated in the future during the remainder of the remedial response process, as determined by subsequent action memoranda or other Record of Decision (ROD) documents. If subsequent responses are determined to be necessary in the remedial process, this Explosives Safety Submission ( ESS) will be reviewed and amended as necessary. Table 1 -1 lists the MRS within the project location . Not all MRSs are covered by thi s ESS. Table 1-1 Munitions Response Site Covered by this ESS Area Total Acreage Munitions Re moval Action Ricochet Area MRSa 1,344 Surface removal of munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) over 1,334 acres and subsurface removal of MEC over 11 acres. Note: a The Ricochet Area MRS is 3,262 acres in size. The planned munitions re moval action will span 1,334 acres of the MRS. 1.2 SITE DESCRIPTION 1.2.1 Terrain and Vegetation The topography of the Ricochet Area MRS is that of the Valley and Ridge System. Inspection of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Topographic Quadrangle (USGS, 1981) s hows the Explosives Safety Submission Ricochet Area Munitions Response Site State Game Lands 211, Pennsylvania Contract No.: W9133L -09-F-0304 2 Project Ricochet Area Area Sharp Mountain ESS \\DDESB Comments\\FIG_ESS_Ric_DrF_rev1acc.docx 2/6/2013 MRS is bounded to the south by Second Mountain, with ridgeline elevations between 1,200 and 1,400 f eet (ft) above mean sea level (amsl ). Stony Creek is at an elevation of nearly 700 ft and marks the lowest topographic portion of the MRS . The approximate northern boundary of the MRS is north of the old railroad grade. Most of the MRS is heavily wooded with dense brush and rock outcrops. Two herbaceous openings totaling 11 acres are maintained as grassland food plots for wild game. Forested wetland areas are interspersed among many of the seeps and springs located throughout the Ricochet Area MRS and along the Ston y Creek stream corridor. Steep and low lying terrain may hinder munitions and explosives of concern ( MEC ) removal actions along the north slope of South Mountain. Analysis of digital elevation maps suggests that less than 1% of the MRS has sporadic steep t errain with a greater than 50% slope creating access issues for personnel. Low lying areas may intermittently fill with water during the rainy season , limiting access. 1.2.2 Soil Condition Four major soil associations are present across the Ricochet The soil in the area is generally thin and rocky. The soil on the steep slopes of the mountains consists primarily of very stony sandy loams with channery subsoil. The valleys contain alluvial materials from the well- drained stony sandy loams on the foot slope to shaley silt loams found along the stream s (USDA, 2009). Roc ks with elevated iron content are present within the MRS ; however , in general, the overall geology and soil conditions do not interfere with the use of magnetometers in this region. 1.3 SITE HISTORY FIG was established in 1931 when the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania purchased approximately 18,000 acres adjacent to SGL 211. Tra ining maneuvers started in 1933. Historical records indicate that surface danger zones extended from FIG into the current area known as the Ricochet Area MRS. From 1945 to 1958, the Army also used the Cold Spring portion of the MRS as a n artillery firing position and a bivouac area. The Ricochet Area MRS was not intentionally used as a target area for military activities conducted at FIG's operational range areas. The presence of munitions within the Ricochet Area Explosives Safety Submission Ricochet Area Munitions Response Site State Game Lands 211, Pennsylvania Contract No.: W9133L -09-F-0304 3 Project Ricochet Area Area and Sharp Mountain ESS \\DDESB Comments\\FIG_ESS_Ric_DrF_rev1acc.docx 2/6/2013 MRS is the result of unintentional overshots and/or ricochets from the former FIG operational ranges in use from 1933 to 1998. 1.4 CURRENT AND FUTURE LAND USE The Ricochet Area MRS is located in SGL 211. Current land use include s a number of recreational activities such as fishing, hunting, hiking, running, bicycle riding, snow shoeing, dog sledding, cross -country skiing, snowmobiling, horseback riding, Fall -Drive -Thru, bird watching, and other outdoor activities. Non-recreational activities within the MRS include trail, game, and forest maintenance performed by PGC employees or its contractors . The majority of the MRS is in an undeveloped state. No major road or railways traverse the site. The PGC plan for future land use includes continued recreational, road construction and maintenance, special wildlife area management, timber management, and preservation area maintenance. 1.5 PROJECT AREA 1.5.1 General A description of the MRS covered by this ESS is given in S ubsection 1.1 and in Table 1-1. This ESS covers the munitions response actions for the Ricochet Area MRS , which is a total of 3,262 acres. The Remedial Investigation (RI) results identified a 1,334- acre area that has an elevated anomaly density and an increased probability for encountering MEC on the ground surface based on current and future land use. Unexploded ordnance (UXO) , including 75 millimeter ( mm) and 155mm projectiles , was recovered in this area. Within the MRS, two herbaceous openings totaling 11 acres are regularly tilled and maintained by PGC personnel, creating an increased probability for encounter ing MEC on the surface and subsurface based on current and future land use. The area of the northeastern herbaceous opening was used as an artillery firing point. Subsurface discarded military munitions (DMM) , including MK-2A4 primers , were recovered from this area.

Previous phases of work include the following: Closed, Transferring and Transferred (CTT) Range Inventory/Phase 3 Range/Site Inventory ( Malcolm Pirnie , 2003). Historical Records Review (HRR) (URS, 2007). Site Inspection (SI) ( URS , 2008). Remedial Investigation (Weston Solutions, Inc. [ WESTON ], 2011). Feasibility Study (FS) (WESTON, 2012). 1.5.3 Selected Munitions Response Actions Based on the results of the RI and current and future land use of the MRS, a surface removal will be performed over the 1,334- acre area. An 11 -acre subsurface removal action to depth-of- detection will be per formed at the herbaceous openings. Table 1 -1 summarizes the munitions response actions for the Ricochet Area MRS . The munitions response actions are also discussed in Subsection 1.5.1. The munitions response actions for the remaining MRS ( i.e., Sharp Mountain MRS) will be addressed in a separate ESS or addendums to this ESS. 1.5.3.1 Land Use Controls The land use controls ( LUC s) selected as likely to be effective and feasible for the Ricochet Area MRS are described in Subs ection 10.1 of this ESS. 1.6 REASO N FOR MEC The MRS history presented in Subsection 1.3 provides the reason for MEC at the Ricochet Area MRS . 1.7 TYPES OF MEC A total of 162 acres of the Ricochet Area MRS were investigated using a combination of visual, analog, and digital magnetic geophysical surveys to delineate the nature and extent of MEC. Explosives Safety Submission Ricochet Area Munitions Response Site State Game Lands 211, Pennsylvania Contract No.: W9133L -09-F-0304 5 Project Ricochet Area Area and Sharp Mountain ESS \\DDESB Comments\\FIG_ESS_Ric_DrF_rev1acc.docx 2/6/2013 Thirteen MEC (9 UXO and 4 DMM) were identified and disposed of during RI activities , 121 munitions debris ( MD) items , and 594 non- munitions related items (manmade/cultural items such as railroad spikes, nails, metal scrap, horseshoes, and wire) were identified and removed from the MRS. Table 1 -2 provides additional detail of the items discovered during the RI. S ubsection 1.5.2 identifies the reports that highlight the past activities and actions conducted at the Ricochet Area MRS.

Preliminary site work activities, such as surveying, laying grid lanes , and anomaly detection, do not require establishing an MSD for Q -D purposes. Project personnel are defined as those on- site contractor and D epartment of Defense ( DoD) personnel required to participate in the MEC removal action, along with those approved and authorized visitors. All other personnel are non- essential personnel. The MSD arcs are depicted on the Q-D map in Figure A-3. Th e team sep aration distance ( TSD ) at this site will be the K40 distance of the MGFD for the specific MRS. Positive control of the exclusion zone (EZ), based on the MSD, will be maintained whenever MEC operations are being conducted. Prior to beginning MEC operations, the contractor will ensure Explosives Safety Submission Ricochet Area Munitions Response Site State Game Lands 211, Pennsylvania Contract No.: W9133L -09-F-0304 7 Project Ricochet Area Area and Sharp Mountain ESS \\DDESB Comments\\FIG_ESS_Ric_DrF_rev1acc.docx 2/6/2013 that there are no non-essential personnel within the EZ , and the contractor will ensure that the EZ remains clear of non -essential personnel throughout the MEC operations by establishing road blocks, barricades, or spotters. If non- essential personnel enter the MSD area, operations will be halted until they can be escorted from , or pass through, the area. 3.3 DEMOLITION EXPLOSIVES 3.3.1 Delivery on an As -Needed Basis Explosives will be provided by a local vendor on an as -needed basis. MEC will be marked and guarded, if necessary, until disposal is accomplished. 3.3.2 Explosive Storage Magazines An explosives storage magazine will not be used . 3.4 PLANNED OR ESTABLISHED DEMOLITION AREAS All disposal activities will be conducte d within each grid using blow- in-place (BIP) procedures. 3.5 FOOTPRINT AREAS 3.5.1 Blow -in-Place The MSD for BIP operations is shown in Table 3 -1 under intentional detonations. The MSD for engineering controls (e.g., sandbag s) for expected MEC items is presented in Table 3-1, and the MSD calculation sheets are provided in Appendix B . 3.5.2 Collection Points It is anticipated that c ollection points will not be used for this removal action. 3.5.3 In-Grid Consolidated Shots It is anticipated that consolidating multiple MEC will not be necessary for this project. 3.6 MAXIMUM CREDIBLE EVE NT No explosive contaminated soil is expected for the areas addressed by this submission; t herefore, no maximum credible event is calculated .

START DATE The anticipated start date of this removal action is June 1, 2013. 5. MEC MIGRATION The potential transport mechanisms for MEC include soil/sediment disturbance, frost heave, and erosion/deposition. Based on the United States (U.S.) Department of Commerce weather map, frost lines range from 20 to 25 inches below ground surface (bgs) . 6. DETECTION EQUIPMENT AND RESPONSE TECHNIQ UES 6.1 REMOVAL DE PTH The planned removal action is identified in Table 1 -1 and discussed in S ubsection 1.5.1. 6.2 DETECTION EQUIPMENT The MEC anticipated at the Ricochet Area MRS are medium - to large- caliber projectiles that are made of ferrous casings that are easily detectable by a variety of geophysical instruments. A combination of one or more of the following geophysical instruments will be used at the site. 6.2.1 Analog Mag and Flag using Flux -Gate Magnetic Gradiometers Approved detectors for this project include the Schonstedt model GA52Cx and Foerster Mk26. These instruments have been demonstrated during the RI and can be expected to consistently detect the MEC items shown in Table 1 -2 at their expected depths. These detection depths are significantly greater than the depths at which any MEC items were recovered during the RI (see Table 1 -2). Other similar geophysical instruments may be approved by the Army National Guard Directorate (A RNG). 6.2.2 Digital Geophysical Mapping Using Time -Domain Electromagnetic Induction Approved detectors for These instruments have similar detection characteristics and can be expected to consistently detect the MEC items shown in Table 1 -2 at their expected depths. Explosives Safety Submission Ricochet Area Munitions Response Site State Game Lands 211, Pennsylvania Contract No.: W9133L -09-F-0304 9 Project Ricochet Area Area and Sharp Mountain ESS \\DDESB Comments\\FIG_ESS_Ric_DrF_rev1acc.docx 2/6/2013 These detection depths are significantly greater than the depths at which any MEC items were recovered during the RI (see Table 1 -2). Other similar geophysical instruments may be approved by the ARNG. 6.3 SWEEP PROCEDURES Before site investigations begin, t he personnel operating detection equipment will demonstrate proficiency with the particular instrument(s) to be used. The site will be divided into grids for administr ative purposes. The search lanes used will be suitable for the equipment and terrain. 6.4 EXCLUSION ZONE CONTROL Prior to initiation of on -site MEC operations, all non- essential personnel will be removed to a location outside the MSD for the operation being conducted. Once MEC operation commences, positive control of the MSD will be maintained and only essential personnel will be allowed inside the MSD. During MEC operations, non- essential personnel will be prevented from entering the MSD by a combination of road closures and the use of spotters, or by the spotters notifying the UXO personnel to stop work when a vehicle or person approaches the MSD boundary. 6.5 INTRUSIVE INVESTIGAT ION Excavation and identification of anomalies will be performed using the criteria and procedures outlined below. The efforts addressed in this ESS involve manual unintentional detonation operations and mechanized unintentional detonation operations employing anomaly avoidance. Only UXO- qualified personnel and UXO Tech nician I under supervision of UXO -qualified personnel will perform excavation and investigation of anomalies. To gain access to a subsurface anomaly, earthmoving machinery such as a backhoe may b e used to assist in removing the overburden within 12 inches to the side or top of the anomaly ; hand tools will be used to remove the remaining overburden. Additional excavation will be conducted using small hand tools only. 6.6 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY AS SURANCE Upon conclusion of the removal activities in each area, the UXO Quality Control Specialist (UXOQCS ) will conduct a surface and subsurface quality control (QC) inspection. Areas that pass the QC inspection will be submitted for quality assurance (QA ) inspection by the United Explosives Safety Submission Ricochet Area Munitions Response Site State Game Lands 211, Pennsylvania Contract No.: W9133L -09-F-0304 10 Project Ricochet Area Area and Sharp Mountain ESS \\DDESB Comments\\FIG_ESS_Ric_DrF_rev1acc.docx 2/6/2013 States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) . Any non- conformance to contractual requirements will be documented and reported in writing to the Senior UXO Supervisor ( SUXOS ), Quality Control Manager (QCM), and Project Manager (PM). The SUXOS will be responsible for the field remediation of the non- conformance. 7. DISPOSITION TECHNIQUES 7.1 DEMOLITION OPERATION S All MEC items requiring detonation will be marked pending BIP disposal. All explosive operations will be supervised by the SUXOS and coordinated with the Government safety specialist. All explosive operations will follow the procedures outlined in TM 60A -1-1- 31 and EM 385-1-97, Explosives Safety and Health Requirements Manual (USACE, 2008), with Errata Sheet Number 5 dated 21 July 2010. Demolition operations will be performed daily. If demolition operations cannot be performed daily because of inclement weather or other similar reasons, the area will be secured until the MEC items can be destroyed . 7.2 EXPLOSIVE STORAGE, A CCOUNTABILITY, AND T RANSPORTATION Explosives will be delivered on an as -needed basis . Total control of explosives will be maintained while the explosives are on -site. All vehicles transporting explosives will be properly inspected, equipped, and placarded prior to loading of explosives onto the vehicle, and DD Form 626, Motor Vehicle Inspection , will be completed. 7.3 ENGINEERING CONTROLS The use of dry sand is authorized as an engineering control for intentional detonation for the MEC identified in Table 3 -1, in accordance with the Buried Explosion Module (BEM) calculation sheets in Appendix B. Although BEM reflects a n MSD of 0 ft, a minimum 220- ft MSD will be maintained during intentional detonations. Sand bag mitigation may be used for intentional detonations as delineated in the Use of Sand Bags for Mitigation of Fragmentation and Blast Effects due to Intentional Detonation of Munitions , HNC -ED-CS-S 98- 7, Amendment 1 (USAESCH, 2011) Muni tions Center of Expertise ( EM-CX) Safety Advisory: Use of Jet Perforator During Explosives Safety Submission Ricochet Area Munitions Response Site State Game Lands 211, Pennsylvania Contract No.: W9133L -09-F-0304 11 Project Ricochet Area Sharp Mountain ESS \\DDESB Comments\\FIG_ESS_Ric_DrF_rev1acc.docx 2/6/2013 Intentional Detonation While Using Sandbag Mitigation for Engineering Controls (USACE, EM - CX, 2011) , and the DDESB memorandum, Clarifications Regarding Use of Sandbags for Mitigation of Fragmentation and Blast Effects due to Intentional Detonation of Munitions (DDESB, 2010). This engineering control may be applied to mitigate fragmentation and blast hazards to the MSD identified in Table 3 -1. A copy of HNC -ED-CS-S-98- 7, Amendment 1 and the DDESB memorandum will be available on -site if this engineering control is applied. Only one MEC item will be destroyed at a time using this technique. Tamping (single or multiple items) may be u sed in accordance with DDESB Technical Paper (TP) 16 and the BEM version 6.3. These reports will be available on -site for all mitigation methods used. 7.4 SCRAP PROCEDURES 7.4.1 Inspection and Certification All material potentially presenting an explosive hazard (MP PEH) and other debris will be assessed and its explosives safety status determined and documented prior to transfer within the DoD or released from DoD control. Prior to release to the public, MPPEH will be documented by authorized and technically qualified personnel as MDAS after a 100% inspection and an independent 100% re -inspection to determine that it is safe from an explosives safety perspective. MPPEH procedures will be in accordance with Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI ) 4140.62 (DoD, 2008). 7.4.2 DD Form 1348- 1A DD Form 1348- 1A or similar form will be completed to reflect that all MDAS has been 100% inspected and re- inspected by qualified individuals in accordance with the requirements outlined in DoDI 4140.62 and EM 1110-1-4009 (USACE, 2007). The SUXOS will sign the c ertificate as follows: \" This certifies and verifies that the material listed has been 100 percent inspected and to the best of our knowledge and belief, is inert and/or free of explosives or related materials.\" Explosives Safety Submission Ricochet Area Munitions Response Site State Game Lands 211, Pennsylvania Contract No.: W9133L -09-F-0304 12 Project Ricochet Area Area ESS \\DDESB Comments\\FIG_ESS_Ric_DrF_rev1acc.docx 2/6/2013 7.5 ALTERNATIVE DISP OSAL TECHNIQUES No off -site destruction of recovered MEC is anticipated for this MEC removal action. All detonations will occur within the grid. No other disposal techniques are anticipated for this MEC removal action. 8. ENVIRONMENTAL, ECOLO GICAL , OR CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS Several special status species of plants exist with in the MRS that will require coordination with the landowner and regulatory agencies , including (Ilex opac a). However, no environmental, ecological, or cultural considerations will limit the removal action . 9. TECHNICAL SUPPORT 9.1 MILITARY SUPPORT No chemical warfare materiel (CWM) is suspected at this site. However, if a munition with a unknown filler is found, or if a MEC item cannot be positively identified, the Government Safety Specialist will notify the local point of contact (POC) as designat ed in the work plan. The local POC is not the local law enforcement agent; he/she will notify the local enforcement agency of the discovery, which will contact Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) . If an item is a recovered chemical warfare materiel (RCWM ) or has an unknown liquid filler, the on-site USACE project team will notify the Chemical Warfare Design Center (CWM -DC) at USAESCH by calling the 24/7 telephone number at 256-895-1180. 9.2 CONTRACTOR All on -site Contractor UXO personnel will meet the training an d minimum experience required by Technical Paper 18, Minimum Qualificatio ns for UXO Technicians and Personnel (DDESB, 2004).

RESIDUAL RISK MANAGE MENT 10.1 LAND USE CONTROLS The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) and PGC have expressed interest and willingness to assist with LUCs that are proposed for the Ricochet Area MRS. The individuals interviewed during the course of the remedial action anticipate a formal LUC program and ARNG guidance and direction on what role their agencies are ex pected to undertake in the context of an overall public education strategy. The following LUCs have been proposed as part of the remedial action : 1. Signs. 2. Notification during permitting and contracting. 3. Brochures/fact sheets. 4. Information packages to public officials and emergency management agencies. 5. Awareness video. 6. Classroom education. 7. Internet website. 8. Appalachian Trail Guidebook editorials. 9. Construction support. 10.2 LONG -TERM MANAGEMENT Recurring reviews will be conducted every 5 years after implementation o f the selected munitions response and overall remedial action, including LUCs described in Subsection 10.1. This effort will be performed to determine whether the munitions response actions continue to be protective of human health, safety , and the environment. Recurring reviews will also provide an opportunity to assess the applicability of new technology to address previous technical impracticability determinations. The review will evaluate specific factors that may impact the continued effectiveness of the response. These factors may include such considerations as changes in physical conditions at the Ricochet Area MRS or changes in public accessibility. If no changes have occurred , the areas will continue to be monitored at the specified intervals . 11. UXO SAFETY EDUCATION PRO GRAM The ongoing public education program includes an active community involvement group for the local population. Additional educational materials are planned as part of the LUCs described in Explosives Safety Submission Ricochet Area Munitions Response Site State Game Lands 211, Pennsylvania Contract No.: W9133L -09-F-0304 14 Project Ricochet Area Sharp ESS \\DDESB Comments\\FIG_ESS_Ric_DrF_rev1acc.docx 2/6/2013 Subsection 10. 1. The LUCs will provide MEC awareness to PGC personnel, its contractors, and the public 12. STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEM ENT PGC , PADEP, AR NG, and USACE, Baltimore District are the principal stakeholders for the overall remedial action process. Both PGC and PADEP support the ARNG - and USACE - preferred remedial alternative proposed for the Ricochet Area MRS.

The UXOSO will ensure the compliance of the demolition team with the above referenced documents that are appl icable to the particular task being performed. The UXOSO will be responsible for notif ying the WESTON PM , United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE ) PM, and local emergency responders in the event of an accident requiring medical attention or the possibility of lost time. The emergency response plan will be used, and first aid, notification , and evacuation will be accomplished as required. The accident site will then be shut down and t he scene preserved/secured for the accident investigation team. 3.4 UXO QUALITY CONTROL SPECIALIST The UXO Quality Control Specialist (UXOQCS) is responsible for ensuring the completeness of demolition operations records and for weekly inspection of the MEC Accountability Log, the Daily Summary Report, the WESTON Demolition Shot Record, and the inventory of MEC and demolition material. The UXOQCS, assisted by demolition team personnel, will inspect each demolition pit and an area of appropriate radius after each demolition shot, in accordance with the approved explosive siting plan, to ensure that there are no kick- outs, hazardous MEC components, or other hazardous items. In addition, the pit may be checked with a magnetometer , and large metal fragments and an y hazardous debris will be removed on a per use basis and stored in sealed containers at the designated project lay down area. Any MEC or material potentially presenting an explosive hazard (MPPEH) discovered during the QC check will be properly disposed of using the demolition procedures presented in Section 3 of the Work Plan. Extreme caution must be exercised when handling MEC or MPPEH that has been exposed to the forces of detonation. Personnel must adhere to acceptable safe practices and procedures when determining the condition of munitions and fuzes that have not been consumed in the disposal process. 4. GENERAL OPERATIONAL AND SAFETY PROCEDURE Personnel, including contractor and subcontractor personnel, involved in operations on munitions response sites (MRS) will be familiar with the potential safety and health hazards associated with the conduct of demolition/disposal operations, and with the work practices and control techniques used to reduce or eliminate these hazards. During demolition operations, the general safety provisions listed below will be followed by demolition personnel at all times. Noncompliance with the general safety provisions listed below will result in disciplinary action, which may include termination of employment. Safety regulations applicable to demolition activities and demolition and MEC materials involved will be complied with. Demolition of any kind is prohibited without an approved Explosives Safety Submission (ESS). Page 3 of 17 \\\\Fsfed02\\1494\\FIG\\CENAB-MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval\\Remedial Action Work Plan \\Draft Final\\Appendices \\E - Demo SOP\\Disposal SOP.docx 10/7/2013 If a recovered item cannot be identified by the UXO Team or if the filler is unknown, the UXO Team will not perform the demolition operations. Also, if the minimum separation distances for a known item encompasses critical infrastructure (buildings and utilities) and the item cannot be moved away from the critical infrastructure, the UXO Team will not perform the demolition operations. These circumstances will require EOD support. Notify the USACE OESS. The quantity of MEC to be destroyed will be determin ed by the fragmentation and K- Factor distance calculations , as specified in the approved ESS . In the event of an electrical storm, dust storm, or other hazardous meteorological conditions, immediate action will be taken to cease demolition operations and to evacuate the area. In the event of a fire, which does not include explosives or energetic materials, put out the fire using the firefighting equipment located at the site? If unable to do so, notify the fire department and evacuate the area. If injuries are involved, remove the victims from danger, administer first aid, and seek medical attention. The UXOSO is responsible for reporting all injuries and accidents that oc cur. Personnel will not tamper with any safety devices or protective equipment. Any de fect or unusual condition noted that is not covered by this SOP will be reported immediately to the SUXOS or UXOSO f or evaluation and/or correction. Methods of demolition will be conducted in accordance with this SOP and approved changes or revisions there after. Adequate fire protection and first aid equipment will be provided at all t imes. Personnel engaged in the destruction of MEC will wear clothing made of natural fiber, close - weave clothes, such as cotton. Synthetic material such as nylon is not authorized unless treated with anti -static material. Care will be taken to restrict exposure to the smallest number of personnel, for the shortest time, to the least amount of hazard, consistent with safe and efficient operations. Work locations will be maintain ed in a neat and orderly condition. Hand tools will be maintained in a good state of repair.

The exhaust system is not exposed to accumulations of grease, oil, gasoline, or other fuels, and has ample clearance from fuel lines and other combustible materials. Employees are required to wear leather, or rubber, gloves when handling demolition materials. The type of glove worn is dependent on the type of demolition material. Vehicles transporting energetics will stay on explosive truck rout es at all times. If this is not possible, the local police will be notified and will need to approve alternate routes prior to use. Unless otherwise directed or authorized by the approved ESS , demolition shots will be tamped with an appropriate amount of earth/dirt. An observer will be stationed at a location where there is a good view of the air and surface approaches to the demolition area , before material is detonated. It will be the responsibility of the observer to order the SUXOS to suspend firing if any aircraft, vehicles, or personnel are sighted approaching the general demolition area. Two-way radios (to include cell phones) will not be operated in close p roxim ity of the demolition area during the priming process and while the pit is primed. Radio transmissions will be kept at a minimum of 50 ft from the explosives. No demolition operation will be left unattended during the active portion of the operation (i.e., once any explosives or MEC are brought to the demolition area ). Page 5 of 17 \\\\Fsfed02\\1494\\FIG\\CENAB-MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval\\Remedial Action ( approximately 50 feet ) around the demolition pit will be cleared of dry grass, l eaves, and other extraneous combustible materials. No demolition activities will be conducted if there is less than a 2,000 ft ceiling or if the wind velocity is in excess of 20 mph. Demolition shots must be fired during daylight hours (minimum time for su nrise and sunset is determined by the firing procedure used (i.e., electric, non-electric, shock tube 30/60/60). Notification of the local authorities will be made in accordance with the site requirements. No more than two persons will ride in a truck transporting demolition material or MEC , and no person will be all owed to ride in the trailer/bed. Vehicles will not be refueled when carrying demolition material or MEC , and must be 100 ft from magazines or trailers containing such items befor e refueling. Explosive vehicles will be cleaned of visible explosive and other contamination, before releasing the vehicles for other tasks. After handling demolition material or MEC and p rior to conducting any other task, personnel will wash their face s and hands . 5. SPEC IAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DEMOLITION ACTIVITIE S The following safety and operational requirements will be met during dem olition operations. Any deviations from this procedure will be allowed only after receipt of written approval from USACE , ARNG, PAARNG, and the Pennsylvania Game Commission . Failure to adhere to the requirements and procedures listed in the paragraphs below could result in serious injury or death; therefore, complete compliance with these requirements and procedures will be strictly enforced. Any deviations from the approved ESS will require a request for approval and a change to the ESS prior to implementation. The change will be submitted through appropriate channels \u2014the Weston Project Manager , USACE PM, PAARNG PM , and the Army National Guard PM. 6. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS The general demolition requirements listed below will be followed at all times: The USACE \"Procedures for Demolition of Multiple Rounds (Consolidated Shots) on Munitions and Explosives of Concern (MEC) Sites,\" will be followed when destroying multiple munitions by detonation on site. This document will be available on-site during site operations. Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB ) TP 16 and/ or the Demolition Tables will be used to calculate the required buried model and protective works. White phosphorus (WP) and propellant will be disposed of only in an approved manner and following the guidance for maximum temperature exposure (90 degrees F ahrenheit ). Note there is no designated area f or the disposal or use of WP at the FIG Ricochet Area MRS . If suspected WP is encountered , arrangements will be made through USACE, ARNG, PAARNG and PGC to designate and document a WP demolition area. Material awaiting destruction will be stored at not les s than intra -line distance, based on the largest quantity involved, from adjacent explosive materials and from explosives being destroyed. The material will be protected against accidental ignition or explosion from Page 6 of 17 \\\\Fsfed02\\1494\\FIG\\CENAB-MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval\\Remedial Action Work Plan \\Draft Final\\Appendices \\E or detonating impulses originati ng in materials being destroyed. Requirements may be found in the ESS , TP 16 and or the Demolition Tables will be used to calculate the required burial and protective works. The components should be placed on their sides or in a position to expose the largest area to the influence of the demolition material. The demolition material should be placed in direct contact with the item to be detonated and held in place by tape or earth packed over the material . Detonations will be counted to ensure detonation of the pit . After each series of detonations, a search will be made of the surrounding area for explosive hazards. Items such as lumps of explosives or unfuzed ammunition may be picked up and prepared for the next shot. Fuzed ammunition, or items that may have internally damaged components, will be detonated in place, if possible. Prevailing weather condition information can be obtained from the local weather service, or other acceptable source and the data logged in the Demolit ion Shot Log before each shot or round of shots. All shots will be dual primed with an electrical/remote firing device (RFD) whenever possible. Whenever possible, during the excavation of the demolition pits , the ground should be contoured so that runoff w ater will be channeled away from the pits. If demolition operations are discontinued for more than 2 weeks, the pits should be backfilled until operations resume. Upon completion of the project, disturbed demolition areas will be thoroughly inspected for MEC. Depending upon contract requirements, the site may have to be backfilled and leveled. If necessary, this will be coordinated with the government representative. An individual who will be excavating on a demolition area will be trained in anomaly avoidance to ensure a reduced risk of encountering MEC or residue from previous demolition operations. Before and after each shot, the WESTON Demolition Shot Record will be filled out by the SUXOS with all applicable information. This record will be kept w ith the MEC Accountability Log and will reflect each shot. 7. ELECTRIC DETONATOR USE The following requirements are necessary when using electric detonators and blasting circuits: Electric detonators and electric blasting circuits may be energized to dangerous levels from outside sources such as static electricity, induced electric currents, and radio communication equipment. Safety precautions will be taken to reduce the possibility of a premature detonation of the electric detonator and the explosive charges. Radios will not be operated during the priming process or while the pit is prime d. When uncoiling or straightening the detonator leg wires, keep the explosive end of the detonator pointing away from the body and away from other personnel. When st raightening the leg wires, do not hold the detonator itself ; rather , hold the detonator leg wires approximately 1 in ch from the detonator body. Straighten the leg wires by hand; do not throw or wave the wires through the air to loosen them. Page 7 of 17 \\\\Fsfed02\\1494\\FIG\\CENAB-MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval\\Remedial Action Work Plan \\Draft Final\\Appendices \\E 10/7/2013 Prior to use, the detonators will be tested for continuity. To conduct the test, place the detonators in a pre -bored hole in the ground or place them under a sand bag, and walk facing away from the detonators and stretch the wires to their full length, being sure not to pull the detonators from the hole or sand bag. With the leg wires stretched to their fullest length, test the continuity of the detonators one at a time by un- shunting the leg wires and attaching them to the galvanometer and checking for continuity. After the test, re -shunt the wires by twisting the two ends together. Repeat this process for each detonator until all detonators have been tested. This process will be accomplished at least 50 ft from and downwind of any MEC or demolition materials and out of the demolition personnel and vehicle traffic flow pattern. In addition, all personnel on the demolition area will be alerted prior to the test being conducted. NOTE: When testing the detonator, prior to connecting the detonator to the firing circuit, the leg wires of the detonator must be shunted by twisting the bare ends of the wires together immediately after testing. The wires will remain short circuited until time to connect them to the firing line or RFD receiver . At the power source end of the blasting circuit, the ends of the wires will be shorted or twisted together (shunted) at all times, except when actually testing the circuit or firing the charge. The connection between the detonator and the circuit firing wires must not be made, unless the power ends of the firing wires are shorted and grounded or the firing panel is off and locked. The firing line will be checked using pre -arranged hand signals . If th e demolition pit is not visible from the firing point, two -way radios will be used . If radios are used, communication will be accomplished a minimum of 50 ft from the demolition pit and detonators. The firing line will be checked for electrical continuity in both the open and closed positions, and will be closed/shunted after the check is completed. MEC to be detonated will be placed in the demolition pit and the demolition material placed/attached in such a manner as to ensure the total detonation of the M EC. Once the MEC and demolition material are in place and the shot has been tamped, the detonators will be connected to the det onating cord. Prior to handling any detonators that are connected to the firing line or R FD, personnel will ensure that they are grounded. The detonators will then be carried to the demolition pit with the end of the detonators pointed away from the individual. The detonators will then be connected to the detonation cord, NON- EL, etc., ensuring that the detonator is not covered with tamping material to allow for ease of recovery/investigation in the event of a misfire. Prior to making connections to the blasting machine or RFD t ransmitter, the firing circuit will be tested for electrical continuity and ohms resistance, or transmitting power (as applicable), to ensure the blasting machine or RFD t ransmitter (distance) has th e capacity to initiate the shot. The individual assigned to make the connections at the blasting machine or pa nel will not complete the circuit at the blasting machine or panel, and will not give the signal for detonation, until satisfied that all personnel in the vicinity have been evacuated to a safe distance. When in use, the blasting machine, or its actuating device, will be in the blaster's Page 8 of 17 \\\\Fsfed02\\1494\\FIG\\CENAB-MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval\\Remedial Action \\E - Demo SOP\\Disposal SOP.docx 10/7/2013 possession at all times. When using the panel, the switch must be locked in the open position until ready to fire, and the single key must be in the blaster's possession. Prior to initiating a demolition shot(s), a warning will be given . The type and duration of such warning will be determined by the prevailing conditions at the demolition area . At a minimum, this should be an audible signal using a siren, air horn, or megaphone, which is sounded for duration of 1 minute, 5 minutes prior to the shot and again 1 minute prior to the shot. 8. NON- EL USE (SHOCK TUBE) The following requirements are necessary when using NON -EL (shock tube ) systems: After cutting a piece of shock tube, either immediately tie a tight overhand knot in one or both cut ends or splice one exposed end and tie the other. Always use a sharp knife or razor blade to cut shock tube to prevent the tube from being pinched or otherwise obstructed. Always cut shock tube squarely across and make sure the cut is clean . Use only the splicing tubes provided by t he manufacturer to make splices. Every splice in the shock tube reduces the reliability of the priming system; therefore , keep the number of splices to a minimum. Always dispose of short , cut-off pieces in accorda nce with local laws as they relate to flammable material. The shock tube system is a thin plastic tube of extruded polymer with a layer of pentaerythritol tetranitrate ( PETN ) coated on its interior surface. The PETN propagates a shock wave, which is normal ly contained within the plastic tubing. The shock tube offers the controlled instantaneous action of electric initiation without the risk of premature initiation of the detonator by radio transmissions, high- tension power lines , or static electricity disch arge. The NON- EL system uses detonators in the bunch blocks and in the detonator assembly, which will be handled in accordance with approved procedures. The shock tube initiating system is highly reliable because all of the components are sealed and , unlike standard non-electric priming components, cannot be easily degraded by moisture. Cutting the shock tube makes the open end vulnerable to moisture and foreign contamination; therefore, care must be taken to prevent moisture and foreign matter from getting into the exposed ends of the shock tubes. Page 9 of 17 \\\\Fsfed02\\1494\\FIG\\CENAB-MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval\\Remedial Action Work Plan \\Draft Final\\Appendices \\E - 10/7/2013 DEMOLITION PROCEDURES 8.1.1 Shock Tube Assembly Spool out the desired length of shock tube from the firing point to the demolition site and cut it off with a sharp knife or razor blade. Weight down the loose end of the trunk line. Immediately seal the shock tube remaining on the spool by tying a tight overhand knot on the cut-off end or use a push- over sealer. Using a sharp knife or razor, cut the sealed end of f the detonator assembly. Push one of the shock tube ends to be spliced firmly into one of the pre -cut splicing tubes provided by the manufacturer at least \u00bc inch. Push the other shock tube end firmly into the other end of the splicing tube at least \u00bc inch. Secure splice with tape if needed. Figure 1 8.1.2 Firing Assembly Setup 1. If there are multiple items to be destroyed using bunch block(s) supplied by the manufacturer, lay out lead lines at the demolition site to the shot(s) and secure the bunch block with a sandbag, or some other item which will keep it from moving. NOTE: No more than six leads may be used from any one bunch block. 2. If the detonator assembly has not been attached yet, use the splicing tube to splice the detonator assembly to the shock tube branch line as explained in the splicing instructions above. 3. If this is a non-tamped shot, place the detonator assembly into the demolition material. If the shot is to be tamped, prepare the demolition materia l with a detonating cord lead long enough to stick out of the tamping at least 1 ft. WARNING Although the detonation along the shock tube is normally contained within the plastic tubing, burns may occur if the shock tube is held.

Return to the firing position. 6. Cut off the sealed end of the shock tube and proceed to the directions listed in Step 7. If you are using a previously cut piece of shock tube, use a sharp knife or r azor blade to cut approximately 18 inches from the previously cut end, whether or not it was knotted in accordance with the above guidance. 7. Insert a primer into the firing device and connect the shock tube lead line to the firing device ensuring that the s hock tube is prope rly seated in the firing device. 8. Take cover. 9. Signal \"f ire in the hole\" three times and initiate charge. 10. Observe a 5 -minute wait time after the detonation. 11. Remain in designated safe area until Demolition Supervisor announces \"All Clear .\" 9. DETONATING CORD USE The following procedures are required when using detonating cord (det cord): The d et cord should be cut using approved crimpers, and only the amount required should be removed from inventory. The det cord should be cut outside the magazine. For ease of inventory control, remove the det cord only in 1 ft increments. The d et cord should not be placed in clothing pockets or around the neck, arm, or waist, and should be transported to the demolition location in either an approved \"day box,\" original container, or a cloth satchel, depending upon the magazine location and proximity to the demolition area. The d et cord should be placed at least 50 ft away from the detonators and the demolition materials until the det cord is ready to use. To ensure consistent safe handling, each classification of demolition material will be separated by at le ast 25 ft until ready to use. When the det cord is ready to be connected to the demolition materials or the detonator, the det cord will be secured to t he item. The cord is then strung out of the hole and secured in place with soil, or filled sandbags, leaving a minimum of 6 ft of det cord exposed outside the hole. Cap Detonating cord Detonator Assembly From bunch block Branch line Splicing tube Tape Figure 2 Page 11 of 17 \\\\Fsfed02\\1494\\FIG\\CENAB-MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval\\Remedial Action Work Plan \\Draft Final\\Appendices \\E - Demo SOP\\Disposal SOP.docx 10/7/2013 Once the hole is filled, make a loop in the det cord large enough to accommodate the detonator, place the detonator in the loop, and secure it with tape. The detonator 's explosive end will face down the det cord toward the demolition material or parallel to the main line. Always ensure that there is a minimum of 6 ft of det cord extending out of the hole to make it easier to attach and inspect the detonator and replace it should a misfire occur. If the det cord detonators are electric, they will be checked, tied in to the firing line, and shunted prior to being taped to the loop. If the det cord detonators are non- electric, the time/safety fuse will be prepared with the igniter in place prior to taping the detonators to the det cord loop. If the det cord detonators are NON -EL, tape the detonators into the loop as described above . In the even t that a time/safety fuse is used, an igniter is not available, and a field expedient initiation system is used (i.e., matches), do not split the safety fuse until the detonator is taped into the det cord loop. 10. TIME/SAFETY FUSE USE The following procedures are required when using a time/safety fuse: Prior to each daily use, the burn rate for the time/safety fuse must be tested to ensure the accurate determination of the length of time/safety fuse needed to achieve the minimum burn time of 5 minutes needed t o conduct demolition operations. To ensure both ends of the time/safety fuse are moisture free, use approved crimpers to cut 6 inches off the end of the time/safety fuse roll, and place the 6- inch piece in the time/safety fuse container. If quantity allows , accurately measure and cut off a 6- ft-long piece of the time/safety fuse from the roll. Take the 6-ft section out of the magazi ne, and attach a fuse igniter. In a safe location, removed from demolition materials and MEC, ignite the time/safety fuse, meas ure the burn time from the point of initiation to the \"spit\" at the end, and record the burn time in the SUXOS's Log . To measure the burn time, use a watch wi th a second hand or chronograph. To calculate the burn rate in seconds per foot, divide the total burn time (in seconds) by the length (in feet) of the test fuse. When using a time/safety fuse for demolition operations, the minimum amount of fuse to be used for each shot will be the amount needed to permit a minimum burn time of 5 minutes. 11. DEMOLITION INSPECTION SCHEDULE The schedule for the demolition inspection will be followed when demolition operations are being conducted. This inspection will be conducted by the UXOSO or UXOQCS and will be documented in the Site Safety or QC Log. If any deficiencies are noted, demolition operations will be suspended and the deficiency will be reported to the SUXOS. Once the deficiencies are corrected, demolition operations may be resumed. Page 12 of 17 \\\\Fsfed02\\1494\\FIG\\CENAB-MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval\\Remedial Action Work Plan \\Draft Final\\Appendices \\E - Demo SOP\\Disposal SOP.docx 10/7/2013 12. METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS To control the effects of demolition operations and to ensure the safety of site personnel, the following meteorological limitations and requirements will apply to demolition operations: Demolition operations will not be conducted during ele ctrical storms or thunderstorms. No demolition operations will be conducted if the surface wind speed is greater than 20 miles per hour. Demolition operations will not be conducted during periods of visibility of less than 1 mile caused by, but not limited to, dense fog, blowing snow, rain, sand storms, or dust storms. Demolition will not be carried out on extremely overcast days with more than 80% cloud cover , with a ceil ing of less than 2,000 ft . Demolition operations will not be initiated until an appropriate time after sunrise, and will be secured at an appropriate tim e prior to sunset (see Section 4). 13. PRE -DEMOLITION/DISPOSAL PROCEDURES 13.1 PRE -DEMO/DISPOSAL OPERAT IONAL BRIEFING WESTON 'S philosophy is that a success ful operation is dependent upon a thorough brief ing, covering all phases of the task, which is presented to all affected personnel. The SUXOS will b rief personnel involved in demolition operations in the following areas: Type of MEC being destroyed . Type, placement, and quantity of demolition material being used. Method of initiation (el ectric, non -electric, or NON- EL). Means of transporting and packaging MEC . Route to the disposal site. Equipment being used (i.e., galvanometer, blasting machine, firing wire). Misfire procedures . Post- shot clean -up of demolition area. 13.2 PRE -DEMO/DISPOSAL SAFETY BRIEFING The WESTON SUXOS, Team Leader, or UXOSO will conduct a safety brief for personnel involved in demolition operations in the following areas: Care and handling of explosive materials . Personal hygiene. Two man rule and approved exceptions. Perso nnel roles and responsibilities . Potential trip/fall hazards . Horseplay on the demolition area. Page 13 of 17 \\\\Fsfed02\\1494\\FIG\\CENAB-MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval\\Remedial Action Work Plan \\Draft Final\\Appendices \\E - Demo SOP\\Disposal SOP.docx 10/7/2013 Staying alert for an y explosive hazards in the demolition area. Calling a safet y stop for hazardous conditions. Location of emergency shelter, if available . Parking area for v ehicles (vehicles must be positioned for immediate departure, with the keys in the ignition ). Location of emergency vehicle. Wind direction (to assess potential toxic fumes) . Locations of first aid kit and fire extinguisher. Route to nearest hospital or em ergency aid station . Type of communications in the event of an emergency . Storage location of demolition materials and MEC awaiting disposal. Demolition schedule. 13.3 TASK ASSIGNMENTS Individuals with assigned tasks will report the completion of the task to the SUXOS. The types of tasks that may be required are: Contact local military authorities and fire response personnel, and get air clearance, as required . Contact hospital/emergency response/medevac personnel, if applicable. Secure all access roads to the demolition area. Visually check demolition area for any unauthorized personnel. Check firing wire for continuity and shunt. Prepare designated pits as required . Check continuity of detonators. Check time/safety fuse and its burn rate. Designate a custodian of the blasting machine, RFD, fuse igniters, or NON- EL initiator . Secure detonators in a safe location . Place MEC in pit, and place charge in desired location . 13.4 PREPARING EXPLOSIVE CHARGE FOR INITIATIO N To prepare the explosive charge for initiation, the procedures listed below will be followed: Ensure firing wire is shunted. Connect detonator to the firing wire. Isolate o r insulate all connections. Prime the demolition charge. Place demolition charge on MEC. Page 14 of 17 \\\\Fsfed02\\1494\\FIG\\CENAB-MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval\\Remedial Action Work Plan \\Draft Final\\Appendices \\E - Demo 10/7/2013 point (if using non- electric f iring system, obtain head count, pull igniters, and depart to designated safe area). Obtain a head count. Give the 1 minute warning signal, using a bullhorn or siren, 5 minutes prior to detonation, and again at 1 minute prior to detonation. Check the firing circuit. Take cover. Signal \" fire in the hole\" three times (or an equivalent warning ). If using electric firing system, connect firing wires to blasting machine, and initiate charge. Remove firing wires from blasting machine and shunt or turn off RF D transmitter. Remain in designated safe area until SUXOS announces \"All Clear.\" This will occur after a post-shot waiting period of 5 minutes and the SUXOS has inspected t he pit(s). 14. POST DEMOLITION/DISP OSAL PROCEDURES Do not approach a smoking hole or allow personnel out of the designated safe area until cleared to do so, and follow the procedures listed below: After the \"All Clear\" signal, check pit for low orders or kick -outs. Examine pit, and remove an y large fragmentation , as needed. Back fill hole, as necessary. Police all equipment. Notify military authorities, fire department , etc. , that the operation is complete. 15. MISFIRE PROCEDURES A thorough check of all equipment, firing wire, and detonators will prevent most misfires. However, if a misfire doe s occur, the procedures outlined below will be followed. 15.1 ELECTRIC MISFIRES To prevent electric misfires, one technician will be responsible for all electrical wiring in the circuit. If a misfire does occur, it must be cleared with extreme caution, and the responsible technician will investigate and correct the situation, using the steps outlined below: Check firing line and blasting machine connections, and make a second initiation attempt. If unsuccessful, disconnect and connect to another blasting machine (if available), and attempt to initiate a charge. If unsuccessful, commence a 30 -minute wait period. After the maximum delay predicted for any part of the shot has passed, the designated technician will proceed down range to inspect the firing system, and a safety observer m ust watch from a protected area. Page 15 of 17 \\\\Fsfed02\\1494\\FIG\\CENAB-MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval\\Remedial Action Work Plan \\Draft detonator wires, connect a new detonator to the firing circuit, check the replacement detonator for continuity, and prime the charge without disturbing the original detonator. Follow normal procedures for effecting initiation of the charge. 15.2 NON- ELECTRIC MISFIRES Working on a non- electric misfire is the most hazardous of all operations. Occasionally, despite all painstaking efforts, a misfire will occur. Investigation and corrective action should be undertaken only by the technician who placed the charge, using the following procedure: If the charge fails to detonate at the determined time, initiate a 60 -minute wait period plus the time of the safety fuse, i.e., 5- minute safety fuse plus 60 minutes for a total of 65 minutes. After the wait period has expired, a designated technician will proceed down range to inspect the firing system. A safety observer must watch from a protected area. Prime the shot with a new non- electric firing system, and install a new fuse igniter. Follow normal procedures for initiation of the charge. 15.3 NON- EL MISFIRE The use of a shock tube for blast initiation can result in misfires, which require the following actions: If the charge fails to detonate, it could be the result of the shock tube not firing. Visually inspect the shock tube. If it is not discolored (i.e., slightly black), it has not fired. If it has not fired, cut a 1 ft piece off the end of the tube, re -insert the tube into the firing device, and attempt to fire again. If the device still does not fire, wait 60 minutes and proceed down range to replace the shock tube in accordance with the instructions outlined below. If the tube is slightly black, then a \"Black Tube\" misfire has occurred, and the shock tube will have to be replaced, after observing a 60- minute wait time. When replacing the shock tube, be sure to remove the tube with the detonator in place. Without removing the detonator from the end of the tube, dispose of by demolition. 15.4 DETONATING CORD MISFIRE WESTON uses det cord to tie in multiple demolition shots, and to ensure that electric detonators are not buried. Since det cord initiation will be either electrical or non -electrical, the procedures presented in Sections 15.1, 15.2, or 15.3, as appropriate to the type of detonator used, will be used to clear a det cord misfire. In addition, the following will be conducted: If there is no problem with the initiating system, wait the prescribed amount of time, and inspect the connection between the initiator and the cord to ensure that it is properly connected. If the connection was faulty , attach a new initiator, and follow the appropri ate procedures for the type of initiator. Page 16 of 17 \\\\Fsfed02\\1494\\FIG\\CENAB-MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval\\Remedial Action detonated but the cord did not, inspect the cord to determine if the problem is with the det cord and not time fuze. Also, check to ensure that there is PETN in the cord at the connection to the initiator. It may be necessary to uncover the det cord and replace it. This must be accomplished carefully, to en sure that the demolition charge and the MEC item are not disturbed. 16. RECORD- KEEPING REQUIREMENT To document the demolition operation procedures and the completeness of the demolition of MEC , the following recordkeeping requirements will be met: WESTON (as d irected) will obtain and maintain all required permits. The SUXOS will ensure that logs are completed accurately , and the SUXOS and UXOQCS will monitor the entries in the log for completeness, accuracy, and compliance with meteorological conditions. The SU XOS will enter the appropriate data on the Ordnance Accountability Log and the Demolition Shot Record, to reflect the MEC destroyed, and will complete the appropriate information on the Explosives Accountability Log (the Magazine Data Card) , which indicates the demolition materials used to destroy the MEC . The quantities of MEC recovered must match the quantities of MEC destroyed or disposed. WESTON will retain a permanent file of demolition records, including permits , magazine data cards , training and inspection records , waste manifests if applicable , and operating logs. Copies of the ATF License and required permits must be made available on site. 17. SAFETY AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS The following safety measures and personal protective equipment (PPE) will be used in preventing or reducing exposure to the hazards associated with MEC demolition/disposal operations. These requirements will be implemented unless superseded by site -specific requirements stated in the SSHP. Hard hats are requ ired only when working around heavy equipment or when an overhe ad or head impact hazard exists. Composite toe/shank boots in accordance with EM 385-1- 1 are required during surface/subsurface location of anomalies. Safety glasses will be required whenever an eye hazard exists, for example, when working around flying dirt/debris and using hand tools. Safety glasses will provide protection from impact hazards and, if necessary, ultraviolet radiation (i.e., sunlight). Positive means will be required to secure t he PPE and prevent it from falling and causing an accidental detonation. Reflective vests will be worn when in proximity to roads or construction equipment (e.g., excavators) Page 17 of 17 \\\\Fsfed02\\1494\\FIG\\CENAB-MAMMS_RicochetAreaRemoval\\Remedial Action Work Plan \\Draft Final\\Appendices \\E - Demo SOP\\Disposal SOP.docx 10/7/2013 18.

American holly is an evergreen shrub or small tree that grows to 50 ft in height. It can be easily recognized by its semi -thick, evergreen leaves with a sharp spine at the tip and additional spines along the margin. The flowers, which appear in May and June, are unisexual, so that the familiar berry -like fruit, red at maturity, can be found only on female plants. This species has b een previously found within the project area along Rattling Run , Dresden Lake, and in multipl e locations along Stony Creek. Woodwardia areolata (Netted chainfern ) - PNDI listed Special Concern S pecies. Found in mois t or wet woods and acidic bogs. No netted chainfern were observed during the Remedial Investigation (RI) fieldwork. However, t his species has been previously found along Rauch Run (located near Standard Operating Procedure Remedial Action for the Ricochet Area MRS State Game Lands 211, Pennsylvania MK01| \\\\FSFED0 FIG\\CENAB- MAMMS_RICOCHETAREAREMOVAL \\REMEDIAL ANIMAL SOP.DOCX [9/24/2013] 3-2 the MRS) , and potential habitat for this species exists in other locations within the project area. Minniebush (Menziesia pilosa) - Unlisted potential species of concern. Found in dry to wet woods and stream banks ; flowering in late May. This species has been previously found outside the project area along Rauch Run. The minniebush was not listed in the PNDI request and response and no minniebush were observed during the RI fieldwork. However, potential forested stream bank habitat exists for this species within the project area so it is being considered as a potential species of concern. 3.2 ANIMAL SPECIES Allegheny woodrat ( Neotoma magister) - PNDI listed Threatened Species. The Allegheny woodrat ranges in size from 14 to 17 inches in total length (including tail). The fur is brownish- gray with slightly darker coloration in the middle of the back. The belly and paws are white and the sides are buff. The Allegheny woodrat has large ears and a furry, bi -colored tail. Its habitat includes cliff faces, in boulder piles, talus slopes, and sometimes in limestone caves. Nests compo sed of shredded plant fibers are found in dry cave entrances, along narrow ledges and in rock crevices. This species feeds on nuts, bark, grasses, fruits, and berries. They are nocturna l and a relatively shy species. Distribution of the Allegheny woodrat is primarily along the Appalachian Mountains from New York to Georgia and west to Indiana. photo source: Cal Butchkowski Standard Operating Procedure Remedial Action for the Ricochet Area MRS State Game Lands 211, Pennsylvania MK01| \\\\FSFED0 FIG\\CENAB- MAMMS_RICOCHETAREAREMOVAL \\REMEDIAL PNDI listed Special Concern Species. The hand- maid moth has a wing span of 1 to 1 \u00bd inches with dark -brown forewings and light brown hindwings. Its distribution is largely known to occur in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York but may reside in other states. Larvae are known to feed on staggerbushes (Lyonia spp.) as a host plant and nocturnal adults do not feed. It requires mixed hardwood forests, hardwood-pine mixes, and scrubland- ( Euphyes conspicua) - PNDI listed Special Concern Species. The Black Dash has a wingspan of 1 to 1 3/8 inches, is richly colored, has a medium -sized skipper and is best dist inguished by its hindwing pattern. In both males and the dark females both above and below , there is a distinctive vaguely diamond- shape patch of yellow surrounded by the much more extensive darker background. The forewing pattern above in males is dominat ed by a thick, sooty-black stigma under a patch of yellow. The female' s forewing above has a bold crescent of yellow s pots, some of them translucent. Its distribution is Southern Ontario, Minnesota, and eastern Nebraska around the southern periphery of the Great Lakes; southern New England south through eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia . Larval food plants consist of Tussock- Sedge ) and adults can be found nectaring on flowering plants, and common and swamp milkweeds. The habitat of the Black Dash consists of wetlands where its food plant occur s, including marshy edges, river meadows, and bogs as well as in nearby uplands Concern Sp ecies. Information on behavior and general biology are lacking at this time.

A mphipods are small invertebrate species (crustaceans) that inhabit cold water sprin gs, seeps, on hillsides and in caves. Allegheny Cave Amphipod has one of the broadest ranges of any species in the genus. Yet, species is still relatively uncommon. These rare invertebrate species are threatened by habitat destruction and poor water quality. Timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus) - Unlisted potential species of concern. Timber rattlesnakes occur in the forested, mountainous regions of the Commonwealth. They prefer forested areas to forage for small mammals (e.g., mice and chipmunks) a nd talus, south to southeastern facing rocky slopes for hibernating and other thermoregulatory activities. The timber rattlesnake is threatened by overhunting, poaching , and habitat alteration. The timber rattlesnake was not listed in the PNDI request and response. However, timber rattlesnakes were commonly found among the scattered boulder areas of the MRS during the RI fieldwork so it is being considered as a potential species of concern. 4. OPERATIONAL PROCEDUR ES The intent of this SOP is for personnel conducting field activities to be able to - Recognize, - Identify , and conduct - Avoidance of all special plant and animal species that have been identified as endangered or threatened. Each phase of the fieldwork will require separate methods and procedures to ensure the protection of special plant and animal species. Prior to any field work activities commencing, awareness training will be conducted for field staff for recognition of se nsitive plant and animal Standard Operating Procedure Remedial Action for the Ricochet Area MRS State Game Lands 211, Pennsylvania MK01| \\\\FSFED0 FIG\\CENAB- MAMMS_RICOCHETAREAREMOVAL \\REMEDIAL PLANT AND ANIMAL SOP.DOCX [9/24/2013] 4-5 species which are expected to be encountered within the site. In addition, field staff will be provided a hands -on, in-field training prior to the start of removal activities. The awareness training and in- field training will be co nducted by a field biologist. It is acknowledged that the American Holly will be easiest plant for identification based on physical appearance year round. The Netted chainfern may not immediately be able to be recognized in early spring activities. Minniebush also falls within a late spring budding process, which will make visual recognition by the untrained eye difficult. The first phases of field work will include mobilization, survey control installation, and installation of the instrument verification s trip. These activities will require minimal to no intrusive activity which could adversely affect plant and animal communities within State Game Land (SGL) 211. One field team member of each team will be assigned the responsibility to identify and document occurrence of plants during fieldwork. The field biologist will complete periodic inspections. Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources ( DCNR ) recommends focusing on all areas within 500 ft of both banks of Stony Creek, Rauch Run, and any unnamed or unmapped springs or seeps within the project area to locate specimens for training purposes. The second phase of work will include the removal of munitions and explosives of concern (MEC). A MEC surface removal will be conducted only in a focused area limited to the portions of the MRS with MEC/munitions debris ( MD) densities greater than 0.5 surface items per acre. This area is a 1,334 acre portion of the overall Ricochet Area MRS. During the MEC surface removal, no excavations will be performed unless MEC is observed protruding from the ground surface. A focused subsurface MEC removal will be performed at the Cold Spring and Yellow Spring herbaceous openings located wi thin the Rico chet Area MRS . These herbaceous openings are maintained by the Pennsylvania Game Commission (PCG) as feed plots and it is unlikely sensitive plant species will be encountered. The subsurface removal area is 11 acres in size and potential subsurface MEC wil l be excavated if detected . Based on the type of instrumentation being used to detect surface MEC within the 1,334 acre portion of the Ricochet Area MRS, the removal action team can meander around trees and brush to minimize the thinning of tree limbs and brush. As such, m inimal disturbance to plant species Standard Operating Procedure Remedial Action for the Ricochet Area MRS State Game Lands 211, Pennsylvania MK01| \\\\FSFED0 FIG\\CENAB- MAMMS_RICOCHETAREAREMOVAL \\REMEDIAL AND ANIMAL SOP.DOCX [9/24/2013] 4-6 is expected during the removal action. All efforts will be made to limit intrusive operations on anomalies within sensitive plant or animal areas. However, if MEC is encountered, the necessary safety an d disposal procedures will be implemented. If MEC items are identified, trained personnel will survey within a 20- foot radius of the item to identify sensitive plant s pecies . If sensitive plant species are identified, the project team will coordinate with the PGC and DCNR for input on the most appropriate method to address protecting the plants on a case by case basis. Mitigation steps will be dictated based on type and numbers of plants, location (terrain) and access and the sensitivity of the munitions item to be detonated. For instance, if the item is safe to move, the item could be moved nearby in an area not within 30 feet of american holly , minniebush, or netted chainfern . Transplan t of plants may also be considered after consultation with PCG and DCNR . It should be noted that all detonations will include the use of engineering controls (sand bag blast mitigation) to significantly reduce effects from the detonation. American Holly Ilex opaca ............................................................................................................................. Description American holly is an evergreen shrub or small tree that grows to 50 feet (15 meters) in height. It can be easily recognized in any season by its alternately arranged, thickish, evergreen leaves that have a sharp spine at the tip and additional spines along the margin. The flowers, appearing in May and June, are unisexual, so that the familiar berry-like fruit, red at maturity, can be found only on female plants. Distribution & Habitat American holly has a distribution from coastal New England south and west into Florida and Texas. In Pennsylvania, it is near the northern end of its range, and occurs mostly in the southeastern counties. The species grows on wooded slopes and streambanks. It has also been grown as an ornamental, particularly in the southeastern counties, and may escape locally to woodlots, thickets, and fencerows. Current State Status The PA Biological Survey (PABS) considers American holly to be a species of special concern, based on the relatively few native occurrences that have been recently confirmed. The species has a PA legal rarity status and a PABS suggested rarity status of Threatened . Conservation Considerations The conservation of American holly in Pennsylvania has concentrated on protecting populations that are believed to be indigenous and that represent native genotypes. Occurrences of the species that have resulted from escapes from plantings are of uncertain genetic origin and are considered to be of much lower conservation significance. As a woodland species, proper forest management and control of invasive species are important for the long term viability of American holly. Gathering of the branches of wild trees for winter decoration should be discouraged.

The leaves are easily distinguishable into vegetative and fertile types. The vegetative leaves have a typical fern-like appearance, being green, flattened, and divided into 7 to 12 very deep lobes (or distinct leaflets on the lower part of the leaf) that are not further subdivided into smaller lobes. The leaf veins are conspicuous and have a net-like or chain-like arrangement, as the common name implies. The fertile leaves of Netted Chainfern are dark colored, much narro wer, not flattened and leaf-like, and have spore-producing structures on their underside. The vegetative leaf of this species resembles the l eaf of the Sensitive Fern (Onoclea sensibilis ), a common species in Pennsylvania, but the lobes in Netted Chainfern tend to be alternately arranged along the leaf stalk while the lobes of Sensitive Fern tend to be oppositely arranged. Photo source: Andrew Strassman (PNHP) Distribution & Habitat Netted Chainfern has a distribution cente red mainly on the Atlantic coastal plain from Nova Scotia south and west into Texas a nd Florida. In Pennsylvania, the species has been documented historically in scattered coun ties, particularly in the Delaware Ri ver drainage. It grows in swamps, seepages, wet woods, boggy wetlands and along the margins of streamlets. Current State Status The PA Biological Survey (PABS) considers Netted Chainfern to be a species of special concern, based on the relatively few occurrences that have been recently confirmed and the wetland habitat. It has no PA legal rarity status, but has been assigned a suggested rarity status of Threatened by PABS. About 30 populations are currently known from the state. 3-2011records since 1980#* records pre-1980!(Woodwardia areolata Conservation Considerations The viability of populations of netted chainfern and its habitat may be enhanced by establis hing buffers around wetlands, controlling invasive species, and protecting the natural hydrology surrounding wetlands.
