Hear From Other Parents \"You never expect you will be the parent of a medically fragile child, and then you are, and suddenly you are regularly faced with making critical decisions for their health and safety. Now more than ever, I am facing these decisions and see the impact firsthand on families and people I care about. I am grateful that my family has chosen to be vaccinated and has had the opportunity, not only to protect our youngest daughter with complex needs, but to protect each other. Getting the COVID-19 vaccine not only protects you, it protects those you love and the individuals you interact with. While much of this pandemic has been uncertain, one thing I can be certain about is that my family has made the right decision in getting the COVID-19 vaccine.\" - Brittany M., mother of three \"My beautiful, amazing, animated, intelligent, caring, 6-year-old daughter Aria was diagnosed with lifelong epilepsy at age 3. Her main seizure trigger is illness, so when the COVID-19 pandemic hit our world, it was our worst nightmare. Though I understand it is unrealistic for a child to never get sick, we do our best to continually protect Aria from illnesses. When Aria contracted COVID-19, it put her into a medical emergency with continuous seizing. We spent weeks at Phoenix Children's Hospital. Through my own experience, I have seen COVID-19 affect more than just the high risk, medically fragile, and immunocompromised. A great way to show care and compassion to others is to get vaccinated. As Aria, my beautiful daughter, has insightfully said when asked what her message would be to parents and children who are sick with COVID or scared to get a vaccine, \"Be brave!\" - Sarah S., mother of Phoenix Children's patient Aria Following are some frequently asked questions and answers about the COVID-19 vaccine. Q: What COVID-19 vaccine is available for children? A: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) for both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines for children ages 6 months and older. Pfizer's vaccine has full FDA approval for those age 16 and older. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine has full FDA approval for those 18 and older. The Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is available under EUA for individuals 18 years and older for whom other FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines are not accessible or clinically appropriate, and to individuals 18 years and older who elect to receive the Johnson and Johnson vaccine because they would otherwise not receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Q: Children with COVID-19 generally do not get as sick as adults. Why is it important for children to get vaccinated? A: While most children experience mild symptoms and make a full recovery, some children become very sick with COVID-19. This is especially true of children with complex and chronic health conditions. The American Academy of Pediatrics reports that hospitalizations for children with COVID-19 are increasing nationwide - including healthy children with no pre-existing conditions. Q: Can my child get COVID-19 from getting the COVID-19 vaccine? A: The vaccine does not use the live virus that causes COVID-19, so no one will contract COVID-19 as a result of getting the vaccine.
