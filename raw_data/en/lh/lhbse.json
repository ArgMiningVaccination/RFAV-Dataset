Acupuncture can be used to treat a variety of ailments including acute pain, physical stress, headaches, sports injuries and even anxiety associated with mental stress and detoxification. Our medical office offers a secluded Therapy Room which offers our patients serenity and calmness as they receive specialty therapies such as acupuncture. Biopuncture Therapy Similar to the philosophy of acupuncture, Biopuncture Therapy leverages the principles of injecting medicine into specific points in the body to stimulate a healing response. The injections can include homeopathic medicine, herbal remedies, or vitamin/minerals depending upon the ailment at hand. Biopuncture is great therapy for pain management associated with injuries and can easily be administered in our medical office.
