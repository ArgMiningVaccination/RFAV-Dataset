If we look back in ancient days to see what King Solomon, King David, King Tut, Queen Esther or Cleopatra would have put in their cabinet, what do you think you would have found? Well, according to ancient documentation, you would have found essential oils. Essential oils were used by kings and queens as part of their daily health regimen and were often more costly than gold and silver. The purpose of this guide is to empower and train you to take control of your health with essential oils. This guide combines both science and ancient wisdom to give you the best recommendations for do-it-yourself home remedies with essential oils. Today, our cupboards and cabinets are full of synthetic chemicals and pills that not only often ineffective, but usually come with side effects. Why continue to rely exclusively on these substances when God has provided us with plant-based essential oils that are even more powerful? Just adding some of the most common essential oils like lavender, frankincense, lemon, peppermint and clove oil to your daily health regimen can: And these are just a few of the health benefits of using essential oils. Now let's talk a bit about what essential oils are, the history of these oils and how you can use them to transform your health!

Essential oils are extracted directly from the bark, flower, fruit, leaf, seed or root of a plant or tree and just one drop can have powerful health benefits. Essential oils are typically created through the process of distillation that separates the oil and water-based compounds of a plant by steaming. Essential oils are highly concentrated oils that have a strong aroma. By concentrating the oils of these plants you are literally extracting some of the most powerful compounds of a plant into a single oil. For instance, in order to get one pound of lavender essential oil, it takes 150 pounds of lavender flowers! So essentially (pun intended) you can receive 150 times the beneficial properties from lavender essential oils than you would from using straight lavender. These natural oils in plants protect the plant from insects, shield the plant from a harsh environment and help them adapt to their surroundings. By taking essential oils, you are harnessing the protective and health-promoting powers of a plant. Essential oils are truly the most potent form of plant-based medicine. Their power to heal and cure disease is so effective that by using essential oils many people are able to avoid the need to use a plethora of drugs or have various types of surgeries. | 5 These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

History of Essential Oils Aromatic plant oils are a vital component of ancient culture that dates back to nearly the beginning of time. It appears that it was the Egyptians who first made extensive use of herbs with distillation methods around 3,500 B.C. Essential oils were used in Egyptian health protocols and used in the burial of rulers and pharaohs. When King Tut's tomb was opened, 350 liters of essential oils were discovered in alabaster jars. It's been documented that Cleopatra, who was famous for her beauty and charm, owned the first spa near the dead sea where she used essential oils for her personal beauty treatments. Also, essential oils were used by Moses and were referenced in the Bible. In fact, in the book of Exodus when the Lord refers to holy anointing oil, it was a specific formula God recommended. This formula was used to anoint priests and kings. And, this holy anointing oil was used when someone went to the priest for healing. The oil was poured onto their head, and they were prayed for. And this wasn't just a ritual, this oil was known to have powerful properties. BIBLE ANOINTING OIL Myrrh 6 kg Cinnamon 3 kg Calamus 3 kg Cassia 6 kgOlive oil 7 kg | 7 These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. In the book of Numbers 16, Moses tells the high priest Aaron to burn oils as incense to stop a plague. We know that these oils, especially cinnamon, have powerful antibacterial properties that can help balance the digestive tract and defend the body.1 Other essential oils used frequently during that time period include frankincense, hyssop, spikenard and cedarwood. This wisdom then sailed across the Mediterranean and evidently reached Hippocrates, who utilized aromatherapy to enhance massage techniques a few centuries before the coming of Christ. Somewhere in the midst of this knowledge transfer, China and India also started to employ herbal remedies and embraced essential oils extensively. Then, as the Bible tells us, 3 wise men gave the infant King of Israel gifts of gold to honor his royalty, frankincense as a perfume, and myrrh for anointing oil. Although there is probably some truth to this, other sources claim that the wise men from the far east were actually being more practical by giving the baby Jesus these precious, costly items that could double as potential health remedies. \"In the Bible, essential oils are referenced 264 times and 33 different types of oils are mentioned.\" During that time frankincense was used to support the immune system and healthy inflammation response. Myrrh was known to help recovery after pregnancy and support hormonal health. As civilizations transferred world power, the essential oil techniques from Greece traveled to Rome which favored aromatherapy and fragrances. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Persia picked up these techniques and perfected the essential oil distillation process. Sadly, the Dark Ages brought with it a disdain for Hippocrates' holistic approach. However, because the Catholic Church viewed bathing as inappropriate, high esteem was given to aromatics, which coincidently are also antimicrobial, to keep foul odor at bay.2 Little did they know that their perfume was also helping stave off airborne germs! During this era, it's believed that Monks continued the tradition of essential oils and | 8 These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. secretly kept herbal tradition alive in the halls of their monasteries. Unfortunately, traditional herbalism was viewed as \"witchcraft,\" and many herbalists were either burned at the stake or persecuted. Thankfully, the Renaissance resurrected herbalism and physicians such as Paracelsus challenged his medical colleagues with testimonials of successfully using plants in patient protocols. What we know as modern \"aromatherapy\" was not introduced formally until French chemist Rene Maurice Gattefosse first coined the phrase in 1937. Although he wasn't necessarily a natural health advocate, he became interested in essential oils after a 1910 accident where he badly burned his hand. Gattefosse used the first available salve in his laboratory \u2014 a pure, undiluted lavender oil compound that not only immediately eased the pain, but aided in wound healing without infection or scar. Because of Gattefosse's work, Dr. Jean Valet used essential oils with injured soldiers in World War II. This led to Marguerite Maury being the first person to \"individually recommend\" essential oil combinations using a Tibetan technique for back massage applied to nerve endings along the spine. Today, essential oils are still used by \"kings\" and \"priests\" as well as by doctors, nutritionists and other experts along with laypeople all over the world. | 9 These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. Why Essential Oils Are So Powerful Essential oils are composed of very small molecules that can penetrate your cells, and some compounds in essential oils can even cross the blood-brain barrier. They differ from fatty oils (like those in vegetables or nuts) that come from large molecules as they are more easily absorbed. For instance, most vegetable oils will stay on your skin and may even clog your pores because they are not small enough to get into your system whereas essential oils will soak right into your skin. Essential oils placed anywhere on the body are \"transdermal,\" which means they can actually pass through your skin and into your circulatory system and cells.3 These oils are typically used in four ways: topically, inhaled by using a diffuser, taken internally and used for personal care. Many essential oils are so powerful that when used topically or internally, they must be diluted with a carrier oil like olive, coconut or jojoba oil. Because of the incredible ability of essential oils to travel through the body and air, even diffusing essential oils can have great health benefits. Think about how powerful the scent of these oils are. An example would be if you had peppermint leaves in your kitchen. Could you smell them from 10 feet away? Probably not. But if Virus Cell BacteriaOuter MembraneEssential Oils | 10 These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. you are diffusing peppermint, cinnamon or oregano essential oils, you can smell them throughout most of your home! That's because the volatile compounds in essential oils can pass from the air into your olfactory system. Your olfactory system , which is your sense of smell, is connected directly to your brain and what you smell can go into your cells and your bloodstream within seconds. This is great for times when your children are not feeling well, as you can simply diffuse essential oils of clove and frankincense in the air and support their immune system through olfaction.4 Once in your system, these oil compounds have the ability to protect and support your body in various ways. Promoting health by means of your olfactory system is why using essential oils has been referred to as aromatherapy. It's important to mention that dried herbs and medicinal tinctures also have health-promoting properties. For instance, ground ginger root, cinnamon and echinacea have many health benefits. Also, consuming healthy foods such as vegetables and fresh herbs can support overall wellness. But in terms of compounds that have the strongest concentrated health-promoting properties, none of these are as powerful as essential oils. | 11 These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. Quality of Essential Oils ... What You MUST Know This is one of the most vital things you must know about essential oils ... not all essential oils are created equally. In fact, most of them are worthless to your health and potentially toxic. There are four grades of essential oils: These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. Synthetic and Altered Oils created in laboratory and lowest grade of oil 1 | Natural and \"Pure\" Oils may be overly processed so they lose beneficial compounds most commonly sold type of essential oils 2 | Certified Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils steam distilled, containing beneficial compounds they may or may not have been sprayed with pesticides therapeutic grade is a first-party designation; i.e. self-certified and not recognized by third parties3 | Certified Organic Essential Oils the highest grade of essential oils with greatest beneficial properties free of pesticides and chemicals third-party certified for purity4 | Creating true quality essential oils starts with planting high quality plants in nutrient-dense organic soil. Then these herbs or plants must be harvested when their beneficial compounds are most available. Next, oils should be extracted using steam distillation, CO2 supercritical fluid extraction or cold pressed without using chemicals. Finally, the oils should be bottled in dark glass containers to protect from oxidation and sunlight. When purchasing essential oils, always buy certified organic oils whenever possible. | 12 These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. How to Use Essential Oils There are four main ways I recommend using essential oils: topical, inhalation, internal and personal care. 1 | TOPICAL USE Some essential oils can be placed directly on the skin, but some cannot and should be mixed with a carrier oil. Some of the best carrier oils include coconut oil, almond oil, oli ve oil, jojoba oil and pomegranate seed oil. Simply take 3-5 drops of the essential oil and put directly onto your skin. If it needs a carrier oil, mix 3-5 drops of essential oils with 1 teaspoon of a carrier oil like coconut oil. Key points of application on the body are: Behind ears Neck Abdomen Soles and tops of feetAlong spineTemples Upper backHow to Use Essential Oils | 13 These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. To apply topically, I recommend: Put 3 drops in palm with carrier oil if necessary. Rub oils together with palm and fingers, then apply to area in circular light massage movement. 1 | 2 |Other ways to use oils topically include: Baths 15 drops mixed with 1/2 cup of Epsom salt makes a fantastic aromatherapy bath. This can help improve circulation, relieve sore muscles, soothe skin, open airways, relax the body and improve sleep. Use soothing oils like eucalyptus and lavender. Compresses 10 drops per 4 ounces of water. Soak cloth and apply for bruises, cuts, aches and pains. Peppermint is one of the best for muscle aches, and lavender is great for cuts and burns. Salves A 2.5% dilution is recommended, which is 15 drops per 1 ounce of oil. You can make salves by mixing coconut oil, beeswax, vitamin E oil and essential oils. You can store salves in a metal or glass container and use for things like cuts, scrapes, bruises or for sore muscle rubs. | 14 These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. 2 | INTERNAL USE* Research suggests that many oils are more effective when taken orally. But only pure certified organic oils should be taken this way. Dosage and dilution is dependent on age, size and health of individual. If you have more in-depth questions, consult your nutritionist or physician. Suggested internal use methods include: Put several drops of oil into an empty capsule and swallow with water Add 1-3 drops to a glass of water, almond milk or coconut milk Put 1-3 drops to 1 teaspoon of coconut oil then consume Add 1-3 drops to 1 teaspoon of raw honey Drop directly under tongue with certain oils I personally put drops of peppermint and lemon oil in my water and drink it throughout the day. *CAUTION: Certain oils can be used internally and others cannot. Certain essential oils suitable for adults are not healthy for children. In-depth questions about internal dosage should be directed to a nutritionist or physician. The following essential oils should never be taken internally: anise, basil, fennel, hyssop, pine, cypress, arborvitae, birch, cedarwood, eucalyptus, white fir and wintergreen. | 15 These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. 3 | INHALATION WITH DIFFUSER Another excellent way to use essential oils is to diffuse them. As discussed earlier, the molecules in essential oils are small enough to pass into your body and cells to support health and wellness. Here are some directions when using a diffuser. Here are some ways to diffuse essential oils: To clean the air, add in essential oils of lemon and clove To improve energy, add in peppermint To induce relaxation, add in lavender * I have the diffuser going around the house and my office all day. \"Putting 15 drops of essential oils in a diffuser or in warm water is fast becoming one of the most popular ways to use essential oils.\" 4 | PERSONAL CARE USE In just a bit, I also want to discuss some common home recipes with essential oils \u2014 like homemade toothpaste, deodorant and body lotion \u2014 but first let's talk about the top essential oils to stock in your herbal cabinet. | 16 These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. The 7 Most Powerful Essential Oils to Stock in Your Herbal CabinetWell known for its soothing, calming properties, lavender is wonderful for promoting natural healing time for burns, cuts, stings and other wounds. It's jam-packed with antioxidant power, which is why researchers from Tunisia evaluated its ability to support healthy blood sugar levels and reduce oxidative stress.5 A Russian scientist Rene Gattefosse first discovered the beneficial properties that lavender oil possessed when he severely burned his arm in an accident. He immersed his hand in a vat of lavender essential oil and found that the oil aided in natural healing without any scarring!

Lemon is best known for its ability to support the body's natural detoxification and is widely used to stimulate lymph drainage, to rejuvenate energy, purify skin and act as an insect repellant. Lemon oil stands out, for research has recently discovered that it carries powerful cleansing properties. According to a study published in the International Journal of Food Microbiology, lemon oil may actually be the most powerful antimicrobial agent of all the essential oils. Lemon essential oil actually comes from the lemon peel, which is the most nutritious part of the lemon, something almost no one has in their diet. Another study published in Experimental Biology and Medicine found that breathing in the scent of lemon essential oils supports healthy neurological activity and promotes the breakdown of body fat.7 Lemon oil is one of the most \"essential\" oils to have on hand and can be used for everything from a detoxification program to freshening up your clothes.
