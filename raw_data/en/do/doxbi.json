Naturopathic doctors follow natural principles of healing. We believe in the power of natural therapies to help people enhance their self-healing process. We seek to identify causes of illness and to treat the whole person, not just to suppress their symptoms. We are primary care physicians trained to do physical exams, order lab testing and offer a wide variety of natural treatments such as: Diet and nutrition Supplementation Lifestyle modification Counseling and stress management Physical medicine This is a profound yet gentle system of health care that is more than 200 years old. It is recognized by the World Health Organization as the second largest therapeutic system in use in the world. It is medicine that can treat people with both acute and chronic illnesses. It takes into account your individuality based on your physical, mental and emotional aspects and treats you by stimulating your body's own healing powers using very small doses of medicine. Also known as herbal medicine, this is a system of healing that uses plants as medicine. It is the therapeutic use of food and plants to treat illness and begin the process of wellness in a non-toxic and safe manner. Herbal medicine is a natural effective alternative to conventional medication. We have in our dispensary a variety of plant substances such as teas, tinctures, liquid plant extracts, herbal capsules and topicals. These are hormones that are chemically identical to the hormones your body produces so are safer and have fewer side effects. Women are seeking a more natural approach to restoring hormonal balance without the risk of cancer. The hormones we prescribe are non-synthetic; they come from natural plant and animal sources which are minimally processed. We also work with compounding pharmacies to customize hormones for your individual needs. Personalized medicine is a rapidly advancing field of healthcare that uses an individual's unique clinical, genetic, genomic, and environmental information to guide decisions made in regard to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. Given these factors are different for every person, the nature of diseases\u2014including their onset, their course, and how they might respond to medications or other interventions\u2014is as individual as the people who have them.
