FDA recall classification may occur after the firm recalling the medical device product conducts and communicates with its customers about the recall and provides contact information for customers with questions. Therefore, the recall information posting date (\"create date\") indicates the date FDA classified the recall, it does not necessarily mean that the recall is new. CBER recall information is available [here](http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/Recalls/default.htm). |Frequently as items become || |[More About Recalls](/medical-devices/medical-device-recalls/what-medical-device-recall) | |[Recognized Consensus Standards](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm) |This database consists of those national and international standards recognized by FDA which manufacturers can declare conformity to and is part of the information the Center can use to make an appropriate decision regarding the clearance or approval of a submission.
