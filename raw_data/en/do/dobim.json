Could it be a false positive? A: It is not possible to distinguish a false positive or false negative from a single COVID-19 test without additional information. For patients with low pretest probability of infection with a positive test, the best course of action is to repeat the test in 24 to 48 hours, ideally using RT-PCR, and if it is positive on both, then it likely represents true infection. If negative, the antigen test may be a false positive, but a second negative follow-up test 24 hours later may provide further assurance that the initial test was falsely positive. As the person is at low pretest probability for infection to begin with, they do not necessarily need to isolate while waiting for confirmatory test results to return. READ MORE "}
