A Chinese artist, he lived as an expatriate in Paris since 1986 until his untimely death at the age of forty-five in 2000. The prognostication of his cancer led him to investigate the traditional spiritual ideology of Daoism and Chinese healing practices, including performative rituals of chanting, dancing, and drumming. In this way, his efforts can be seen in the context of ancient Daoist activities linked to the search for longevity and spiritual harmony. Chen succeeded in creating a remarkable body of work, particularly in the last years of his life, which demonstrates the influence of Daoist spiritual thought.Chen Zhen, who was born in Shanghai in 1955, grew up in a French- and English-speaking medical family in the former French Concession during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76). In 1980, at the age of twenty-five, he received the diagnosis of hemolytic anemia, an incurable illness. After traveling through Tibet, he moved to Paris in 1986, where he would remain for the rest of his life. In these years, Chen found life as an \u00e9migr\u00e9 difficult due to an array of economic and cultural concerns. Chen ultimately coined the term transexp\u00e9rience, which, as he explained, \"effectively and profoundly synthesizes the different experiences lived through when you leave the land of your birth and move from one place to another based on the relationship between Man, consumer society and Nature.\"1 Soon after his arrival in Paris, he stopped painting and turned to installations. He lived with the prognosis of a five-year survival for over fifteen years.Much attention has been directed towards Chen Zhen and his extraordinary artistic projects. His multimedia works are extremely complex and multilayered. Accordingly, interpretations of his oeuvre abound; essays by critics, collectors, friends, and curators draw upon the rich and varied nature of his art, examining deep social, aesthetic, and philosophical readings. His many installations explore contrasting values\u2014consumerism and spirituality, Eastern and Western cultures, and the experience of being an expatriate\u2014bridging the art and life of China and Paris, old and new, monochrome and color, natural and artificial, life and death, health and illness. In his last years, Chen incorporated sound into his compositions. It is fortunate that a number of these performances were taped, although their quality is often poor and duration short. In addition, he encouraged the audience to participate in his installations, with the result of their efforts creating unique sounds that have helped define these late works.An important composition during this period, which first appeared in 1997, combined audience participation, sound, and spiritual themes. Although Chen's interactive installation Prayer Wheel\u2014Money Makes the Mare Go addresses the issue of consumerism, its origin lies in traditional Tibetan prayer wheels. In Tibet, Chen had a profound spiritual experience: It filled me with very strange feelings, and extraordinary mental illuminations. I managed to get into a Tibetan temple usually closed to the public, where I heard the monks reciting prayers. Facing my body with an \"immaterial environment\" was a unique experience. That confrontation was beneficial both physically and spiritually. That experience still nurtures me today and gives me both inspiration and energy for my work.2Chen, it should be said, sardonically replicates the Tibetan prayer wheel. In Tibetan ritual practice, the adherent turns the prayer wheel, which contains verses of the scriptures; setting the wheel in motion is a form of prayer and meditation. In Tibet, these wheels range in size from small to the monumental. In this case, Chen made a wheel-like ovoid structure whose inner chamber was filled with Chinese abacuses, calculators, cash registers, metal, wood, and a sound system. As viewers pushed the bell, the sound of cash machines and abacuses vibrates. In this way, they prayed for wealth, which, as Chen would say, is the new world religion. As Anne Vincent-Goubeau has previously observed, \"the installation, in repurposing old and discarded consumer materials and by giving them a new function alludes to the cycle of life.\"3Chen's discovery of used chamber pots became the material from which he constructed several major installations. On a return trip to visit his old home in Shanghai in 1993, he saw women in the street occupied by the old-fashioned daily chore of washing the pots. As it reminded him of his youth, Chen collected a bunch of these pots and shipped them home. Although these works do not require audience participation, they are sound-producing and bear a certain spiritual power. It appears that Chen drew upon a ritual from his youth in communist China: Every morning on my way to school, I would hear the sounds of chamber pots being washed. Before school actually started, I would also hear the \"daily incantations\"\u2014that is the obligatory daily reading aloud from Mao Zedong's Little Red Book intended to \"cleanse the soul.\" Washing the chamber pots was a daily ritual in the city and reading incantations from the Little Red Book was part of political indoctrination. This double incantation, bringing together the daily ritual on the one hand, and the ritual reading of the \"sacred\" writings on the other, created a juxtaposition of sounds, symbolizing the complex relation between traditional and contemporary Chinese life.4The recorded sounds of washing, spoken word, and chanting are essential features of Daily Incantations (1996), a large installation employing one hundred and one old wooden chamber pots. Filling the gallery space, the \"night stools\" (chamber pots) hang like ancient Chinese musical bells. The installation replicates the assembly of sets of ancient Chinese bronze ritual bells excavated in 1978 from the tomb of Marquis of Yi (433 BCE) in Hunan. Imitating the configuration of the archaeological find, Chen suspended the pots like bells on large wooden supports and arranged them in a circular formation. The speakers installed inside each of the pots played the sounds of cleaning the stools that women traditionally performed each day. What is more, the cylindrical shapes of the pots resemble the bronze bells. Chen's recreation of the enormous sets of ancient bells directly links the work to sound, musical instruments, and Chinese ritual music. At the center of the installation, Chen designed a huge ball of metal wire and electrical cord, inside of which he placed old television sets, outdated radios, amplifiers, speakers, and other electronic equipment. Chen also recorded \"incantations,\" the sayings in Mao Zedong's Red Book that promoted the values of a communal society he remembered as a boy. Having lived through the Cultural Revolution, his association with the writings were particularly strong.Notably, the recordings included political speeches from television and radio programs in three different languages (English, French, and Chinese). Exemplified here are the diverse contrasts that often appear in Chen's art, with the ancient but well-maintained toilet utensils in opposition to the modern and outmoded debris of the electronic world: the still useful and now useless; the old, worn, and long-lasting with the new but outmoded; wooden objects and electronic devices. Apparently, the smell of the pots was still perceptible, adding another sensory perception to the experience that belied the visual appeal of the objects and their grandiose arrangement. Chen explained that these pots had multiple associations for him, and one of them, crucially, was medical.What is interesting to me about the pots is that they are, first and foremost, not works of art. They are ordinary objects made for daily use. The Chinese have a double concept about the chamber pot: the first is that most people view it as an ugly thing. The second is that those who believe in superstition think that the chamber pot is the \"son and grandson stool.\" It helps to propagate and reproduce, and to carry the generations onward. The intrinsic duality of this object is very close to the inner quality of contemporary art. The white calcium sediment on the inside wall of the chamber pot is even a preciously rare Chinese medicine, called \"philtrum white,\" which is used to dispel heat and alleviate fever.A second installation that employs chamber pots, and a foil to Daily Incantations, is Chen's Nightly Imprecations (1999), a three-part arrangement, more intimate in size, and employing second-hand domestic furniture. One section has an enclosed Chinese bed filled with numbered polystyrene balls made to dance in the air by a fan; at its center is a series of the chamber pots hanging from a large square wooden frame; while at the other end is a bed with a mattress covered with a yellow silk sheet pierced by multiple thin metal spikes. Here, the noise of the dancing balls accompanies the sound of the pots being washed. The possible meanings suggested by the materials are varied: the random movement of the balls suggests games of chance, while the yellow silk blanket conveys luxury, and the spikes recall acupuncture and tortuous nights of unrest and pain. There are no sure conclusions to draw from the combination of such disparate elements; rather this kind of ambiguity is characteristic of his art.Continuing to employ chamber pots, Chen later created Music Library (2000). He lined up twelve pots in four rows of three and placed them in a wooden frame so that they resemble books on shelves. Here, too, the pots are conveyors of sounds that Chen calls music. Approaching the subject from the opposite side is his work Sound of Silence (2000). Here, four pots hang over three old Chinese hardback chairs. Finally, in Diagnostic Room (2000), a spare reconstruction of a sterile medical examination room, the pots rest on a long bench on which visitors can sit.
