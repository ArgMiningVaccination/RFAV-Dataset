The program permits a state to furnish an array of home and community-based services that assist Medicaid beneficiaries to live in the community and avoid institutionalization. The State has broad discretion to design its waiver program to address the needs of the waivers target population. Waiver services complement and/or supplement the services that are available to participants through the Medicaid State plan and other federal, state and local public programs as well as the supports that families and communities provide. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recognizes that the design and operational features of a waiver program will vary depending on the specific needs of the target population, the resources available to the state, service delivery system structure, state goals and objectives, and other factors. A State has the latitude to design a waiver program that is cost-effective and employs a variety of service delivery approaches, including participant direction of services.

In one page or less , briefly describe the purpose of the waiver, including its goals, objectives, organizational structure (e.g., the roles of state, local and other entities), and service delivery methods. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 6 of 302 12/16/2022The Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS), the state Medicaid Agency (MA), has delegated the day-to- day operations for the waiver to the Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS), Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD), the Operating Agency (OA). Responsibilities of each agency are defined in an interagency agreement. The OA is the lead agency for community-based services and supports to adults with developmental disabilities. The OA is responsible for eligibility determination, Person-Centered Plan (PCP) development and implementation, enrolling waiver providers, reporting to the MA, and assuring services and providers meet established standards. The MA enrolls providers in Medicaid, provides oversight, consultation and monitoring, processes federal claims and maintains an appeal process. The Waiver for Adults with Developmental Disabilities provides supports to eligible adults with developmental disabilities ages 18 and over. The supports provided are designed to prevent or delay out-of-home residential services for customers or to provide residential services in the least restrictive community setting for customers who would otherwise need ICF/IID level of care. Customer need for waiver services is determined by the ISC agencies, which are under contract with OA. Individual Service and Support Advocacy coordinators (ISSAs) are employed by ISCs. ISCs practice a person-centered approach to assessment, care planning and on-going care coordination. Customers are provided with the opportunity to lead the care planning process. Those who choose not to lead are still engaged at all levels of assessment and care planning. ISCs evaluate applicants need for waiver services using a standardized assessment instrument. This discovery process is part of a comprehensive care assessment and designed to identify all needs and risks of the individual, including health and well-being, depression, suicide, substance abuse, and support to and from care givers. Customers receiving waiver services are informed of their rights and responsibilities and their role in the person-centered plan. Customer rights and responsibilities are defined in official documents, on the website and reviewed and explained at various points of the assessment and planning processes with signatures and other affirmations documenting participation and acknowledgement. The customer and the provider(s) who are responsible for the implementation of the PCP will receive a copy of the PCP. Providers must sign the PCP and return it to the ISC. The waiver affords customers the choice between customer direction, including both budget and employer authority and more traditional service delivery, or a combination of the two options. The waiver offers a full array of services which include; Adult Day Service, Community Day Service, Residential Habilitation, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Speech Therapy, Self Direction Assistance, 24-Hour Stabilization Services, Adaptive Equipment, Assistive Technology, Behavior Intervention and Treatment, Behavioral Services (Psychotherapy and Counseling), Emergency Home Response Services, Home Accessibility Modifications, Non-Medical Transportation, Personal Support, Remote Support, Skilled Nursing, Supported Employment - Individual Employment Support, Supported Employment - Small Group Support, Temporary Assistance, Training and Counseling Services for Unpaid Caregivers, and Vehicle Modification. Customers who choose home-based supports select from a menu of services based on their individual needs within a monthly services cost maximum. When customers exercise employer authority and hire domestic employees, the services of a Financial Management Services (FMS) entity are available. Customers also have a variety of therapies and other services available to them. ISC staff are trained to educate customers on available providers and assist in making informed choices. Customers are given choices and may receive one or more services. Other services are available through other local and state funding sources and may be included in the PCP in addition to waiver services. The OA uses all willing and qualified providers for providers seeking certification. OA staff ensure that providers meet all standards being certified and before a contract is issued. Residential service customers are provided with residential services and supports from the qualified provider of their choice. These customers may also select day programs and have a variety of therapies and other services available to them. All customers receive assistance in directing service delivery options from Independent Service Coordination (ISC) entities under contract with the Operating Agency (OA). ISC entities under contract with the OA serve as the local point of access for adults with developmental disabilities. The MA and the OA maintain separate but complementary processes to monitor customer welfare, service access, and quality. The OA provides the MA with reports of their monitoring activities, including sanctions. The OA responds to the MA's reports Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 7 of 302 12/16/2022from data obtained in site visits and file reviews conducted by federally approved Quality Improvement Organizations. Negative findings are addressed with corrective actions. The MA and OA meet quarterly to discuss reports that identify problematic trends and track the effects of remediation efforts to improve performance. An entity called the Developmental Disability Advisory Committee (DDAC) advises the OA on an ongoing basis on reimbursement rates for waiver services, and recommendations regarding issues affecting waiver service delivery. Composition requires representatives from the OA, providers, advocates, stakeholder groups and state agencies. The MA attends all advisory committee meetings and actively participates to clarify Medicaid or waiver policy issues. 3.

Describe how the state secures public input into the development of the waiver: I. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 11 of 302 12/16/2022The State solicited public input for this waiver amendment in several ways. The public comment period began 09/09/2022 and concluded on 10/09/2022. On 09/09/2022 the State Medicaid Agency posted on its public website a draft of the proposed waiver amendment. That link is: http://www2.illinois.gov/hfs/MedicalPrograms/HCBS/Pages/default.aspx. The non-electronic method of public distribution occurred with postings at Illinois Department of Human Services local offices throughout the state (except in Cook County). In Cook County, the notice was available at the Office of the Director, Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, 401 South Clinton Street, 1st Floor, Chicago, IL. Additionally, a telephone number was provided within the notice to request a paper copy of the proposed waiver amendment. The public notice invited comments via email or regular mail. Finally, the Illinois Department of Human Services, Division of Developmental Disabilities, the operating agency of the HCBS Waiver for Adults with Developmental Disabilities, shared with their stakeholders and other interested parties. Copies are also available at the following locations: Healthcare and Family Services, 201 South Grand Avenue East, Springfield, IL 62763 Healthcare and Family Services, 401 South Clinton Chicago, IL 60607 The draft waiver amendment will remain on the public website until final approval from CMS. The State issued tribal notification on 09/09/2022. The State received the following comments: (ALL COMMENTS HAVE BEEN ABBREVIATED DUE TO CHARACTER LIMITATIONS) 1) What is the increase stipend for host home CILA consist of in January? STATE RESPONSE: As stated in the Waiver Amendment: \"The Host Family Stipend is determined on resource need and is largely determined using the ICAP. In other words, customers with high needs as determined by the ICAP receive a higher stipend than those with moderate or low needs. Effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval, the stipends range will increase to $80.00/day for a customer with lower needs up to $115.00/day for a customer with higher needs. The Regional Wage Factor applies to this rate. The stipend assumptions are taken from the 2006 Host Family rate methodology, updated for inflation.\"\" 2) I am concerned regarding the ongoing barriers individuals will experience in accessing occupational therapy (OT). The current process or access to services, authorization of services, service requirements, and updating the Person-Centered Plan (PCP) is burdensome. There are instances when needs can be met through consultation or education, which is currently not an option. Few occupational therapists currently provide waiver-funded services in Illinois. By addressing these concerns, I believe that more occupational therapists will choose to provide services and those practitioners who are already providing these services will be able to provide even greater benefit. STATE RESPONSE: Thank you for your comment. The DDD will take into consideration for future amendments the current requirements to access Occupational Therapy and the ability for an Occupational Therapist to provide consultation or education services in addition to habilitative supports. The DDD will also consider issuing an Information Bulletin to provide guidance on how to access OT services. Insofar as requiring an update to the PCP, this is a nonnegotiable requirement of the waiver. 3) IARF COMMENTS: - We support rate components being adjusted annually and reimbursed at the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) median wage. This ensures reimbursement rates for positions remain competitive and a viable reimbursement system is maintained. - This amendment does not reflect an increase in the vehicle purchase component, as recommended by the Guidehouse Rate Study. We suggest this be included to promote community integration and allow waiver participants to be engaged in their communities. - Bringing the direct support wage rate reimbursement to 150% of minimum wage will have positive effects on a workforce that is in critically short supply. Expansion of the day services and restructuring rates for providers will allow a wide spectrum of supports. Providing funding for staff 24H/DAY in CILA will ensure supports in their home any time Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 12 of 302 12/16/2022they are needed. Additionally, funding community day service providers in the Chicago area at the same 15% rate enhancement as CILA ensures funding parody across the I/DD system. STATE RESPONSE: DDD will take all the above suggestions into consideration. 4) EQUIP FOR EQUALITY COMMENTS: - We urge the State to remove all nursing caps and the disqualification for people who need 24-hour nursing services. - We ask the State to cap the size of all future CILAs at four people and to ensure that all CILA residents have freedom in their homes and spend their days in integrated, individualized activities in the community that provide competitive, integrated employment. - We recommend the State clarify the process for proactive monitoring and use the Ligas monitoring protocol to improve the proactive monitoring process. Finally, we recommend information about the grievance process is widely disseminated Waiver participants/families and ensure ISC providers are fully trained on its provisions. Response: DDD will take all the above suggestions into consideration. -We urge the State to include a robust plan for outreach and timely placement of institutionalized people with IDD, including opportunities for individuals to gain a full understanding of community living. The State should also develop a plan to provide HCBS to people who choose them, including creating waiver slots. STATE RESPONSE: An outreach plan has been implemented through ISC visits to SODCs and ICF/DDs to educate individuals, families, and guardians on waiver services. Continued in Main B Optional.

Additional Needed Information (Optional) Provide additional needed information for the waiver (optional): Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 16 of 302 12/16/2022CONTINUED FROM MAIN 6 - REQUIREMENTS: -We recommend the State include a plan to ensure people with IDD are supported to live in the community. The State should require providers to accept appropriate referrals; make a commitment to stop using SODC placements for Waiver participants in crisis by funding a sufficient number of community-based crisis beds; and develop a plan to rebalance the IDD system, including the closure of SODCs. We also ask that the State eliminate or at least raise the mental health care caps. STATE RESPONSE: DDD works tirelessly with providers to place individuals in the most appropriate setting. Short Term Stabilization and Support Service Team services are available through the waiver. There are no caps on either of these services. Waiver services are intended to complement behavioral health services available through the State Plan. -We recommend that the State remove the requirement that a person must successfully complete a DRS Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program to receive SEI or offer an alternate through which a person could get individual supports. We further recommend removing the 5h/day, 1200 h/yr limit on SEI. Finally, we ask a mechanism to be created for ensuring that people with IDD work in competitive and integrated sites. STATE RESPONSE: Successful closure from VR indicates a successful outcome in a competitive and integrated job, at which point SEI may be requested. -We recommend a higher rate of pay for home-based services for those with higher needs, caps are removed from mental health services, the state pay for all mental health services, and there be no limit for intermittent CILA recipients or, at minimum, that the process for getting more than 15 h/wk of Remote Support services be simplified. STATE RESPONSE: Your recommendation has been shared with the agency with authority over the State Plan services. DDD will review the service limits for waiver services. The base level of 15 h/wk was set in conjunction with the Guidehouse Rate Study. DDD is in the process of simplifying the process for increasing support hours. -We recommend the State lengthening the 10-day period for an appeal, provide a method for individuals to appeal without an ISC; and to remove the requirement for \"re-appealing\" in the case of an adverse decision on informal review. STATE RESPONSE: Timely filing of an appeal is paramount in the process. The 10-day requirement is simply for the individual to indicate they want to appeal. They have 50 days to formalize the appeal paperwork and submit. The individual has to appeal the decision at each level according to their wishes. CONTINUED FROM APPENDIX G-2-a-i SAFEGUARDS CONCERNING THE USE OF RESTRAINTS: Restrictions on other types of Restraint are prohibited as follows: 1. Prone Restraint (i.e. being restrained, face down against the floor or another surface) is prohibited. 2. Supine Restraint (i.e. being restrained, face up) is prohibited. 3. Mechanical Restraint is prohibited. Mechanical Restraint does not include any restraint used to treat a customer's medical needs; protect a customer known to be at risk of injury resulting from lack of coordination or frequent loss of consciousness; provide a supplementary aid or service or an accommodation, including, but not limited to, assistive technology that provides proprioceptive input or aids in self-regulation; or promote customer safety in vehicles used to transport customers. 4. Chemical Restraint is prohibited. Chemical Restraint does not include medication legally prescribed and administered as part of a customer's regular medical regimen including PRN medication, to manage behavioral symptoms and treat medical symptoms. 5. If any of the above types of Restraint is utilized by provider agency staff, the incident must be reported via CIRAS as well as reported to the Office of the Inspector General as appropriate. All provider agency employees are required to receive the following: A) Developmentally appropriate training initially (at hire) and annually thereafter, that shall include, but not be limited to: 1. Crisis de-escalation; 2. Trauma-informed practices; 3. Behavior management practices; and 4. Alternatives to the use of restraint. B) If the provider agency is utilizing Restraint, the provider agency staff must receive developmentally appropriate training initially (at hire) and annually thereafter, that shall include, but not be limited to: 1. Restraint techniques; 2. Restrictive interventions; Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 17 of 302 12/16/20224. Identifying signs of distress during restraint.

D) A copy of the provider agency's policies on the use of Restraint. Any customer, guardian, if applicable, organization or advocate may file a signed, written complaint with the Director of the Division of Developmental Disabilities, alleging that the provider agency serving the customer has violated this section. CONTINUED FROM APPENDIX I-1: The State was approved for a Good Faith Effort exemption request for the implementation of an open/hybrid model Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) on November 21, 2019. On June 3, 2021, the MA posted a Request for Proposal (RFP) to secure the open/hybrid model Electronic Visit Verification (EVV). The winning bidder has been selected. The state anticipates the EVV system will be operational by the end of calendar year 2022. This system will be used for the personal care services (PCS) and Home Health Care Services (HHCS) as defined in the 21st Century Cures Act. PCS are defined as Activities of Daily Living (ADL), such as movement, bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, and personal hygiene and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), such as meal preparation, money management, shopping, and telephone use. HHCS are defined as personal care services or home health care services requiring an in-home visit by a provider that are provided under a state plan or 1915c waiver. Customers have the choice to continue to use the current EVV system operated by the OA or change to the open/hybrid EVV model system that will be maintained by the MA. To ensure financial integrity and accountability, EVV will allow the state to monitor and reduce in unauthorized services, improve the quality of services to customers, and reduce fraud, waste and abuse. The MA staff utilizes its Data Warehouse query capability to analyze the entire dataset of paid waiver claims. The MA utilizes an exception report and review format as a component of the agency's financial accountability activity. Claims for waiver services are compared with claims for nursing home, hospitalized, or death dates to look for overlapping dates of service to ensure there is no fraudulent or inappropriate billings. Agency staff have constructed database queries that encompass waiver eligibility, coding and payment criteria. Based on these criteria, twice a year the MA conducts analysis of all paid claims and only the claims that were not paid in accordance with set parameters are identified and extracted. The identified exceptions are printed out with all relevant service data. Current exception reports identify paid claims for waiver services to customers who were in a nursing home or who are deceased. In addition to the exception reviews of waiver claims, MA staff conduct targeted reviews of individual waiver services, utilization of waiver services by individual customers and billing trends and patterns of providers. These reviews are usually conducted on an impromptu basis. The results of all financial reviews are presented to OA personnel under cover memos with supporting claim detail. The OA advises the MA of corrective actions taken, including adjustments, for all service claims identified by the reviews that were not paid in accordance with defined parameters. (c) the agency (or agencies) responsible for conducting the financial audit program. State laws, regulations, and policies referenced in the description are available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency (if applicable). The MA and OA are responsible for conducting the financial audit program. The State has several measures in place to ensure that claims describe services rendered. First, errors in billing may be found by the OA or waiver service provider. Second, the MA's claiming system does not allow the OA to submit a claim for a period in which the customer was not active on Medicaid or was active on another HCBS waiver. Further, the OA has implemented systematic checks and internal controls in the billing system, to combat errors and fraud, which verify customer identification and service authorization information. The OA reviews the identified errors and send in a corrective billing through the OA system. The OA system adjusts current and previous remittance as applicable. The OA system then adjusts any previous claiming based on updated provider payments or recoupments. Additionally, the MA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) has jurisdiction to investigate concerns of waste, fraud, and abuse. The OA and the MA OIG work closely together to refer concerns for each entity to investigate. Finally, to ensure billing submissions match services provided, QI reviews are conducted by the OA for each OA contracted provider. CONTINUED IN MAIN B OPTIONAL UNDER APPENDIX I-2-a Program Support Costs: Included in the methodologies is a program support component that represents costs that are not direct Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 18 of 302 12/16/2022care related nor administrative but have an impact on quality. These costs are specific to the program but are not billable, such as quality assurance activities and staff training. The program support percentage is calculated based on direct care cost data reported in the provider survey. Effective 1/1/23, or upon CMS approval, the Program Support Cost in CILA is set at 5.6% of the Program Component costs, developed from provider cost surveys based on the proportion of reported program support expenses relative to Program Component costs. Supply Costs: There is a cost center in the methodology called \"Other Supplies.\" This refers to the costs incurred in the provision of habilitation and training services associated with activities of daily living such as training materials specific to a customer's Person-Centered Plan (PCP) to assist with increasing skill levels and independence. The methodologies allocate a set allowance of $273.91/per customer/per month for this cost center which is the same allowance in the current CILA rate methodology. Consultant Services Costs: This cost center provides reimbursement for consultant services that may be necessary to provide or update assessments and develop various therapy plans. The allowance is based on the ICAP score, with customers in the low need range receiving a lower allowance than customers in the high need range. Nursing Costs: Recognizing the need for customers with developmental disabilities to have regular health care supports and monitoring, reimbursement for 12 hours of LPN and 1 hour of RN supports per year are built into the base reimbursement for all customers receiving CILA residential supports, in all types of CILA settings. Effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval, the OA is changing the base nursing calculation to 18 hours of RN supports for all types of CILA settings. Per the IL Nurse Practice Act (225 ILCS 65/55-30), LPNs can't provide services without RN oversight; therefore, the OA is changing this calculation to fund all RN hours for this support. Base nursing is intended to reimburse providers for the cost associated with the completion of nursing assessments, health risk identification and planning, health supports coordination and implementation, health monitoring and to develop updates to the nursing care plan. Currently, in 1 - 4 person homes, the base nursing is increased to 1 hour of RN and 18 hours of LPN supports per year with additional nursing support hours available as determined by a customer's Health Risk Screening Tool (HRST) Health Care Level (HCL) score so that a customer can receive up to 77.4 hours of nursing support if warranted by health care level. Effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval, the OA is expanding the HLC multiplier for the nursing components to all 24-hour CILA (1-8 person homes). All nursing supports are adjusted annually and reimbursed at the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) median wage. In addition, there is funding built into the rate to account for RN oversight of medication administration and RN supports for required nursing treatments. The OA is removing the LPN hours for this cost center; therefore, RN oversight will no longer be necessary. The time calculations for medication administration and oversight and treatments are based on the submission of a customer's Medication Administration Record (MAR) and Treatment Administration Record (TAR). An RN in the OA reviews the MAR and TAR and calculates the staff hours needed for medication administration and treatment oversight. Administration: The current 24-hour CILA rate methodology incorporates administrative expenses as a fixed cost of $3,666 per year. The Administration reimbursement was derived from the original 24-hour CILA cost of $30,000. At that time, administration costs were set at 10% of the entire CILA rate, or $3,000. The administration cost was converted from a percentage of the CILA Base Residential rate to an annual fixed amount effective July 1, 1999 and has received periodic legislatively mandated COLA adjustments since that time. Based on information received from the provider wage and cost survey, Guidehouse's resulting analysis as outlined in the Guidehouse Rate Study recommended the administration costs be revised to 15.8% of the Program Component portion of the CILA rate. This represented the median percentage of program costs spent on administrative costs as reported by the providers. The OA will fully implement this recommendation in accordance with the multi-year implementation plan. Currently, Administration costs for all Intermittent CILA types and Host Family CILA are set at 10% of the Program Component portion of the rate. Effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval, the Administrative cost will change from 10% for 24-Hour, Host Family, and Intermittent CILA to the 15.8% recommended by the Guidehouse Rate Study. Transportation: The transportation component in the 24-hour CILA model is a calculation of two inputs - Vehicle Purchase and Vehicle Operation - divided by the number of individuals living in the home. See Section D.5.3 of the Guidehouse Rate Study for further explanation. The Intermittent CILA rate methodology includes a staff mileage allowance of 50 miles/week, calculated at the 2020 IRS mileage rate. The Host Family CILA rate methodology includes staff mileage allowances for QIDP, Supervisor, Relief & Vacation Staff of 46 miles/week. In addition, the methodology includes a Host Family mileage allowance for ten 7.5- mile trips per week. The mileage allowance will be adjusted annually upon new rates set by the IRS. . Effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval, the mileage portion of the transportation component will increase to the 2022 General Services Administration (GSA) mileage rate of $0.625 per mile. Regional Wage Factor: Effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval, the OA will be implementing a Regional Wage Factor for all CILA Rate Methodologies. The Regional Wage Factor is part of the Guidehouse Rate Study and is based on an analysis of Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 19 of 302 12/16/2022reported provider costs, required local minimum wage increases, the consumer price index, and BLS wage data. Guidehouse determined a factor of 15% for the Regional Wage Factor would be necessary to keep pace with higher wage increases in the Chicago metro and collar counties of Illinois. Customers living and receiving CILA services in Chicago and collar counties will have their CILA Rates calculated using increased wage reimbursement and ERE with the Regional Wage Factor. Rate Components that Differ by CILA Type: 24 Hour CILA Base staffing costs comprise the largest share of each customer's rate. The reimbursement authorized for this cost center depends on assumptions and internal calculations that model staffing needs each day throughout the week, extrapolated to include the entire year. Assumptions associated with \"Time of Day/Day of Week,\" \"Staff to Resident Ratio,\" as well as substitute staff assumptions are used to calculate the ultimate total reimbursement associated with DSP hours. Previous to this amendment IL.0350.R05.01, CILA reimbursement for base staffing costs are determined on resource need and is largely determined using the ICAP. In CILA, an individual's ICAP was used to estimate the amount of staffing hours needed throughout the year. Incremental changes in score will increase or reduce those hours and the budgeted costs associated with them. Effective 1/1/2023, or upon the approval of CMS, in addition to the ICAP, the OA is implementing an adjustment factor based on the customer's Health Care Level (HCL) as determined by their Health Risk Screening Tool (HRST). Health Care Level (HCL) is an additional factor in determining the number of DSP hours calculated for a customer in 24-Hour CILA. This factor is incorporating additional DSP time to facilitate customers in getting to and from needed medical appointments. This also implements one of the Guidehouse Rate Study recommendations. Customers with higher HCL Scores will have additional DSP time incorporated into their CILA Rate as a higher HCL score objectively measures and quantifies a customer's health need(s). Room and Board: The room and board component is removed from the rate the State claims for federal matching funds. Rates for 24-hour CILA currently include room and board charges. The housing portion of the room and board component is an annual per capita cost by county and CILA home size with adjustments to reflect whether individuals are likely to have their own bedrooms and with a built-in disincentive for larger homes. The housing portion of the room and board costs is based on HUD Fair Market Rent tables and have received periodic increases as funding would allow. The non-housing portion includes reimbursement for such things as utilities and telephone, property and business insurance, maintenance and housekeeping, food supplies and non-food supplies. The annual per capita cost is scaled down for larger homes. The calculated per diem rate is offset by an individual's unearned income, which is collected by the provider. Occupancy Factor: Providers of 24-hour CILA services bill \"present\" for days the customer is receiving CILA services and supports at the CILA site and in the community. Providers bill an applicable non-attendance code for any day the customer is not present in the CILA setting or receiving CILA supports for a complete midnight to midnight 24-hour period. The reimbursement for 24- Hour CILA supports is paid on a per-diem basis for days the customer was served. Providers are not paid for non- attendance days. The CILA Rate Methodology for 24-Hour CILA supports assumes a customer is receiving services from the CILA provider 19 hours per day, Monday through Friday, and up to 24 hours per day on weekends, 13 holidays and 10 other days the customer may not attend a day program. The annual funding is averaged for an equal per-diem rate paid to the CILA provider regardless of what day of the week the CILA supports are delivered. Community day services account for the other 5 hours of the day during the week. Intermittent CILA The rate methodology for Intermittent CILA is based on billing on an hourly basis. The Intermittent rate methodology assumes an average of 15 hours of staffing per customer per week as currently determined by the customer's habilitation team and authorized based on customer needs. Reimbursement for base staffing costs are determined on resource need and is largely determined using the ICAP. A customer in need of additional staffing hours may request approval for additional hours by identifying the needs of the customer and documenting the anticipated staff time needed to address the customer's needs. A Productivity Factor of 20% is used to account for unbillable DSP time. The Productivity Factor percentage follows the logic as specified in the Rate Study for day programs and is factored based on the anticipated percentages of billable and unbillable activities provided by the DSP. Understanding that providers will need to pay staff for unbillable time, the productivity factor is a new and necessary part of the Hourly Intermittent Rate Methodology. Reimbursement for Supervisor costs assumes 2.5 hours a week as does reimbursement for QIDP costs. The QIDP and Supervisor Wage Rates were established using the 2018 Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) median wage. The wages are adjusted annually using the most current BLS median wage and based on the percentage increase received by the DSPs in order to avoid Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 20 of 302 12/16/2022compression in the wage bands. Billable Hourly Rates: As not all intermittent services are provided on a 1:1 basis, three different billing codes with three different rates will be available to providers, depending upon the staff intensity of the service being provided. With all the assumptions above, hourly based billing rates effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval, will be: 1:1 staffing -- $50.76/hour statewide and $57.81 in Chicago and collar counties 1:2 staffing -- $25.38/hour statewide and $28.90 in Chicago and collar counties 1:3 or higher staffing -- $16.92/hour statewide and $19.27 in Chicago and collar counties Customers are automatically authorized for a maximum of 780 hours annually which can be used flexibly throughout the day, week, month, and year as the customer wants, needs and the PCP dictates. There is a process for requesting additional hours as warranted above. Host Family CILA The Host Family Stipend is determined on resource need and is largely determined using the ICAP. In other words, customers with high needs as determined by the ICAP receive a higher stipend than those with moderate or low needs. Effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval, the stipends range will increase to $80.00/day for a customer with lower needs up to $115.00/day for a customer with higher needs. The Regional Wage Factor applies to this rate. The stipend assumptions are taken from the 2006 Host Family rate methodology, updated for inflation. Reimbursement for Supervisor and QIDP costs vary depending on the number of customers served in the Host Family CILA. For 3 - 4 bed CILAs, the methodology assumes 2.5 hours a week for each position and assumes a 1:16 ratio. For 1 - 2 bed CILAs, the methodology increases to 3.22 hours per week for each position and the ratio drops to 1:12. The QIDP and Supervisor ratios are determined by the required monitoring activities for Host Family supports in Illinois Administrative Code Title 59, Chapter 1, Part 115, Section 115.620. The QIDP and Supervisor ratio for 1 and 2 bed Host Family Supports is adjusted for required monitoring activities based on an economy of scale. The QIDP and Supervisor Wage Rates are established using the 2018 Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) median wage. The wages are adjusted annually using the most current BLS median wage and increased based on the percentage increase received by the DSPs in order to avoid compression in the wage bands. Relief Staff Costs: For Host Family CILA, an important program support is billable relief staff to allow the family or live-in caregiver time away from the home. The Host Family rate methodology includes 20 hours per month per person served of relief staff time and 2 weeks of vacation per year. Effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval, relief and vacation staff wages will increase to $17.00/hour with 29.9% ERE. ERE includes legally required benefits such as unemployment taxes, federal insurance contributions and worker's compensation, paid time off components such as vacation, sick, personal and holiday days and other benefits such as retirement, health insurance and vision and dental insurance. Relief and vacation time are set in rule at Illinois Administrative Code Title 59, Chapter 1, Part 115, Section 115.600. In addition, transportation is funded for the transportation of individuals served to and from community activities and for relief and vacation staff to allow for travel to and from the Host Family site. Transportation allowances for staff (Supervisor, QIDP, and relief and vacation staff) is set at 46 miles/week. Transportation allowance for the Host Family is set at 75 miles/week. Also effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval, all mileage reimbursement will be paid at the 2022 General Services Administration (GSA) mileage rate of $0.625 per mile. The mileage allowance will be adjusted annually upon new rates set by the GSA. Community Living Facility (CLF) rates are calculated based on past individual provider cost reports. Rates are reviewed based on cost report submissions. Rates are subject to cost of living adjustments when enacted and may be adjusted based on rate appeals. CLFs were not part of the Guidehouse Rate Study. The OA received approval from the Illinois General Assembly to increase CLF rates by 2% effective 1/1/2023, or upon the approval of CMS. Day Habilitation Services (Community Day Services - On Site, Community Day Services - Off Site, and Enhanced Residential Habilitation). These rates were originally established July 1, 2006, by the OA and approved by the MA and have been subject to proposed legislative increases in subsequent years. Base compensation for direct service workers forms the foundation of each day habilitation program rate and is equivalent to the statewide DSP hourly wage reimbursement and employee related expenses (ERE) factor of 29.9% for one direct service worker. DSP wages are adjusted when funding is approved by the Illinois General Assembly. The DSP hourly wage reimbursement is currently $16.00 per hour and will increase to $17.00 per hour 01/01/2023, or upon CMS approval. Community Day Services - On Site is the only day habilitation service that includes capital costs because this is the only day program that requires the use of a facility which incurs reimbursable capital costs. These costs are calculated as the median ratio Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 21 of 302 12/16/2022of reported annual costs of facilities to the product of clients and annual attendance hours for each facility. Capital costs are set at $1.30 per hour per customer as reported in the provider cost survey. A staff productivity factor then adjusts the effective hourly compensation to reflect the billable time of a worker assuming five hours of billable time per eight-hour day for each worker. The productivity factor covers employer staff costs for non-billable or other administrative activities. Although DSPs serving as attendants cannot bill specifically for transportation time, the rate methodology for day programs reimburses this time through a productivity-impacted \"trips adjustment\" that considers the significant non-billable time associated with travel and lunch hours. See Section D.2.2 in the Rate Study. The productivity adjustment, as well as the supervision factor and occupancy adjustments are applied to account for costs of supervisor compensation and for attendance and availability of day program facilities respectively. The supervision factor reflects the proportion of supervisor compensation, using the wage and ERE assumptions for Lead DSPs, to the ratio of direct service workers to supervisors as reported by each facility. Supervision costs are based on analysis of supervisor span of control in the cost surveys. Staffing ratios are assumed based on recommendations from the Rates Oversight Committee and finalized in the Guidehouse Rate Study. Assumed ratios for rate development purposes are: Community Day Services - On Site 1:5 Community Day Services - Off Site 1:4 Enhanced Residential Services 1:3 The occupancy adjustment assumes each facility is open for 260 days annually and is paid for 240 days of attendance by customers annually according to median occupancy information as reported in the cost survey. Administrative expenses represent the proportion of administrative costs for providing day program services to direct service costs; because direct service costs increase as minimum wage increases, the value for this input should continue to be tied to direct care costs. Administrative overhead factor is set at 18.9% of direct care compensation, developed from provider cost surveys based on the proportion of reported administrative costs to direct care compensation. Program support costs represents costs that are not direct care related nor administrative but have an impact on quality. These costs are specific to the program but are not billable such as quality assurance activities and staff training. Program support factor is set at 10.6% of direct care compensation, developed from provider cost surveys based on the proportion of reported program support expenses relative to direct care compensation. Transportations costs: The transportation factor is only part of the Community Day Services - On Site, Community Day Services - Off Site and Enhanced Residential Habilitation Services rates. Base compensation for drivers is the basis of the transportation rate, and because drivers are typically direct service workers, this is equivalent to the statewide minimum hourly wage for one direct service worker. This compensation is then adjusted by the same occupancy factor used for day program calculations. Transportation-specific cost components include costs relating to the following categories as reported by providers in the provider cost & wage survey, adjusted to the 260-days of operation: Materials and Supplies Fuel and Lubricants Tires Insurance Utilities Technology and Communication Related to Transportation Travel and Meetings Other Miscellaneous Transportation-Related Expenses Passenger Revenue Vehicles Service Vehicles Other Transportation-Related General Administration Facilities Maintenance Personnel Vehicle Depreciation Property Depreciation Capital Leases Amortization Land Improvements Amortization Purchase Lease Payments Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 22 of 302 12/16/2022 The 18.9% administrative expenses for day program costs hold for the transportation rate and is applied to the total of the adjusted compensation and vehicle and equipment costs listed above. Combining each of these components, including drivers' wages and benefits as well as vehicle-related costs and administrative expenses. See Sections D.1.6 and D.2.2 in the Rate Study. The key component of the transportation add-on is the trips adjustment, which translates the cost of providing transportation via one vehicle to a unit rate by dividing the daily cost by the expected number of trips per day, calculated based on loading and unloading time, number of riders, trip distance, driving speed, and productivity. These components of the trips adjustment are based on reported transportation metrics from the provider cost and wage survey, assumptions about assisting ambulatory and non-ambulatory clients, and policy priorities. Dividing the total daily cost by the trips adjustment and by the number of riders yields a rate per trip per customer. The rate for Community Day Service will be updated 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval. Supported Employment - Individual Employment Support (SEI) and Supported Employment - Small Group Support (SEG) Rate Methodology These rates were originally established July 1, 2006, by the OA and approved by the MA and have been subject to proposed legislative increases in subsequent years. The rate for both SEI and SEG will be updated 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval. Base compensation for job coaches forms the foundation of each supported employment program rate which is a statewide $17.23 hourly wage. The job coach wage is derived from the BLS Occupational Statistics for Illinois in May 2018 and adjusted for inflation to determine the FY22 job coach wage rate assumption of $17.23. The wages are adjusted annually using the most current BLS median wage and increased based on the percentage increase received by the DSPs in order to avoid compression in the wage bands. Included is an ERE factor of 29.9% for one job coach. Hourly wages determined by BLS Occupational Statistics will be adjusted annually. Further, adjustments for billable time including the productivity adjustment and days adjustment (equivalent to the concept of an occupancy adjustment in day programs) are different for employment services. Here, the productivity adjustment assumes 6.4 billable hours from an 8-hour day while the days adjustment assumes job coaches can bill each of the 260 service days in a year. The supervision factor is calculated similarly, using differentials between job coaches and job coach supervisors. The supervision factor reflects the proportion of supervisor compensation, using the wage and ERE assumptions for job coaches, to the ratio of job coaches to supervisors as reported by each provider. Supervision costs are based on analysis of supervisor span of control in the cost surveys. The supervision factor is also adjusted similar to the staff productivity factor using differentials between job coaches and job coach supervisors, adjusting the ratio of the supervisor to supervisee time. Staffing ratios are assumed based on recommendations from the Rates Oversight Committee. The ratio for SEG Group Levels 1 is being decreased and Level 2 is being increased effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval. Supported Employment - Individual Employment Support 1:1 Supported Employment - Small Group Supports for SEG Group Level 1 1:3 Supported Employment - small Group Supports for SEG Group Level 2 1:6 Administrative expenses represent the proportion of administrative costs for providing supported employment services to direct service costs; because direct service costs increase as minimum wage increases, the value for this input should continue to be tied to direct care costs. The administrative overhead factor is set at 18.1% of direct care compensation and was developed from provider cost surveys based on the proportion of reported administrative costs to direct care compensation. Program support costs represents costs that are not direct care related nor administrative but have an impact on quality. These costs are specific to the program but are not billable such as quality assurance activities. The program support factor is set at 10.6% based on the proportion of reported program support expenses relative to direct care compensation. Transportations costs: Transportation costs are based on anticipated mileage reimbursement for the job coach of 13.5 miles per day at the GSA 2022 Mileage allowance of $0.625 per mile, effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval. The mileage allowance will be adjusted annually upon new rates set by the GSA. SEI Rate effective 7/1/2022: $38.30 Rate effective 1/1/2023, or upon the $40.67 Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 23 of 302 12/16/2022Weighted estimate: $39.49 SEG Rate effective 7/1/2022: $11.03 the approval of CMS: $11.71 Weighted estimate: $11.37 Adult Day Service: Adult Day Service (ADS) is defined as the direct care and supervision of adults in a community-based setting for the purpose of providing personal attention and promoting social, physical, and emotional well-being in a structured setting. ADS providers in this waiver are the same as used by the Illinois Department on Aging (IDoA). They have the same staffing ratios and the same qualifications as the providers used by the IDoA. The ADS rate is based on the rate established by the Illinois Department on Aging (IDoA) in the Elderly waiver (0143). The rate structure in IL-0350 includes ADS transportation in the ADS rate. The ADS rate was originally established by legislation. The ADC rate includes both administrative and direct care costs. Rates are not geographically based and do not include room and board. ADS rates are reviewed minimally every five years by IDoA to ensure the rates are adequate to maintain an ample provider base, quality of services, budget sustainability, appropriateness, compliance with service requirements, and compliance with any new federal or state statutes or rules affecting the program. The ADS rate is being increased effective 1/1/2023 to $19.82 per hour to align with other state agencies who have similar service providers. A study of day service rates was last conducted in 2018, and rates were last increased in 2021. This rate is being increased effective 1/1/2023, or upon the approval of CMS, to align with the rate in IL-0143. Rate effective 7/1/2022: $12.34 Rate effective 1/1/2023, approval: $19.82 Weighted estimate: $16.10 Personal Support/Temporary Assistance Services Rates are negotiated between the customer, guardian (as applicable) or representatives and the providers with assistance from the Self Direction Assistance provider. The negotiated rates are specified in the Service Agreement and are subject to review and approval by the OA on either a targeted or sample basis. These rates are not subject to cost of living adjustments. Home Accessibility and Vehicle Modifications, Adaptive Equipment, Assistive Technology Rates are usual and customary. Payments are subject to prior approval by the Operating Agency. Two bids are required for approval. Per-customer five-year cost limits and specific cost limits on rental housing governing the use of these services. Non-medical Transportation Statewide mileage rates are set by the OA. Per-trip rates are usual and customary charges. The rate is subject to cost of living adjustments when enacted by the General Assembly and signed by the Governor. Emergency Home Response Services (EHRS) EHRS is a 24-hour emergency communication link to assistance outside the home for customers with documented health and safety needs and mobility limitations. This service is provided by a two-way voice communication system consisting of a base unit and an activation device worn by the participant that will automatically link the participant to a professionally staffed support center. The statewide rates for installation and monthly basic service are adopted from the rates by the IDoA for their persons who are elderly waiver (IL-0143). The State worked with an external vendor to review its rates to determine if the current rates are efficient, cost effective and allow for the purchase of services at the lowest rate that will ensure access to waiver services by multiple providers. Based upon its analysis, the State increased the Medicaid reimbursement rate for EHRS to $40 for a one-time installation. In developing the rate, the State examined Medicaid reimbursement rates paid in other states, as well as analyzed installation costs incurred by existing contracted and non-contracted providers. The State examined the cost components underlying into the installation activity, which could include administrative costs (completing paperwork, contacting the customer, scheduling an appointment), training and testing (include training the customer to properly use the device and testing the range capacity within the device) and the cost of transportation to the customer's home to perform the installation. Based on this analysis, the State will employ a methodology of frequent, ongoing review to ensure that the installation rate remains in line with similarly situated programs in other states and is reflective of the cost of providing the installation service. The rate for EHRS was last updated in 2019. This rate is being increased effective 1/1/2023, or upon the approval of CMS, to align with the rate in IL-0143. Rate effective 7/1/2022: $28.00 Rate effective 1/1/2023, for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 24 of 302 12/16/2022Weighted estimate: $29.01 Behavior Intervention and Treatment There are two rate levels for this service based on provider qualifications. The higher rate (Level 1) was based on a weighted combination of Bureau of Labor Statistics wage for licensed clinical psychologists with a doctoral degree, provider survey results, and a comparison to bargaining agreement wages for state employees. The lower rate of 80% rate of the higher rate was based on a weighted combination of Bureau of Labor Statistics wage for a master's degree, provider survey results, and a comparison to bargaining agreement wages for state employees. Both rates are subject to cost of living adjustments when enacted. The rate was last set and reviewed in 2020. Behavioral Services (Psychotherapy and Counseling) and Skilled Nursing Rates are based on available cost data for clinical psychologist and social workers on contract with traditional developmental disabilities agencies. The rates are subject to cost of living adjustments when enacted. These services include both individual and group psychotherapy and counseling. The rates for Behavioral Services were last set and reviewed in 2020. The rate for skilled nursing is based upon the Home Health Agency and Home Nursing Agency Fee Schedule effective 11/1/2019 and updated 2/1/2020. The fee schedule is posted at: https://www2.illinois.gov/hfs/SiteCollectionDocuments/CopyofHomeHealthFeeScheduleeff11012019rev02042020Final.pdf. Rate effective 7/1/2022: $39.74 Rate effective 1/1/2023, the approval of CMS: $43.87 Weighted estimate: $41.82 Occupational Therapy (OT), Physical Therapy (PT), and Speech Therapy (ST) These rates are based on rates within the Home Health Fee Schedule [https://www2.illinois.gov/hfs/MedicalProviders/MedicaidReimbursement/Pages/HHFeeSchedule.aspx]. These rates are increasing to $111 per hour effective 1/1/23, or upon CMS approval. Rate methodologies for Home Health Services under the State Plan are reviewed annually to ensure rates are adequate to maintain an ample provider base and to ensure quality of services. The State completed a review of the OT, PT, and ST rates 12/6/2021. Rate effective 7/1/2022: $36.00 Rate effective approval: $111.00 Weighted estimate: $73.72 Self-Direction Assistance (SDA) SDA is receiving a 2% Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) increase effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval, in order to keep pace with the QIDPs in the Independent Service Coordination (ISC) agencies. Program Component: The Program component of the rate methodology reimburses providers for those costs incurred in providing Self Direction Assistant services. Included in the program component are reimbursement for Qualified Intellectual Disabilities Professional (QIDP) staffing costs, Supervisor staffing costs, and supply costs. The QIDP and Supervisor Wage Rates are established using the 2018 Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) median wage, adjusted to present day. A 28.1% Employment Related Expenses (ERE) factor is calculated on all staff wages. The wages are adjusted annually using the most current BLS median wage and increased based on the percentage increase received by the DSPs in order to avoid compression in the wage bands. Program Support Costs: Included in the methodology is a program support component that represents costs that are not direct care related nor administrative but have an impact on quality. These costs are specific to the program but are not billable such as quality assurance activities. The program support percentage is calculated based on direct care cost data reported in the provider survey and set at 10.6% of the Program Component costs. Supply Costs: There is a cost center in the methodology called \"Other Supplies.\" This refers to the costs incurred in the provision of self-direction and training services associated with activities of daily living such as training materials specific to a customer's Person-Centered Plan (PCP) to assist with increasing skill levels and independence. Administration: The SDA rate methodology incorporates administrative expenses as a fixed percentage set at 18.9%. This represents the median percentage of program costs spent on administrative costs as reported by the providers. A Productivity Factor of 20% is used to account for unbillable staff time. The Productivity Factor is based on the anticipated Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 25 of 302 12/16/2022percentages of billable and unbillable activities provided by the QIDP. Understanding that providers will need to pay staff for unbillable time, the productivity factor is a necessary part of the SDA Rate Methodology. Transportation: The transportation component includes a staff mileage allowance of 10 miles/day and is adjusted annually upon new rates set by the GSA. SDA Rate effective 7/1/2022: $50.26 Rate effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval: $51.27 Weighted estimate: $50.77 24 Hour Stabilization Services The rates for this service are initially established through a Request for Applications process. Through this process, the State compares the proposed rates of willing providers. A standard methodology is developed for the waiver service with variation based upon a number of factors defined below. The required components that are used to establish the rate are: - Direct support staff wages. DSP wages are adjusted when funding is approved by the Illinois General Assembly. The current DSP hourly wage reimbursement is $16.00 per hour and will increase to $17.00 per hour 01/01/2023, or upon CMS approval. Because the DSP staff providing services in 24 Hour Stabilization Services are Registered Behavior Technicians (RBTs), they are given an additional 20% increase over the DSP rate. - Professional staff wages and clinical contracts, e.g., QIDPs, Behavior Analysts, nurses, etc. The wages are adjusted annually using the most current BLS median wage and increased based on the percentage increase received by the DSPs in order to avoid compression in the wage bands. - Employment-related expenditures, e.g., employee benefits, FICA, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, etc. ERE expenditures will be changed to the following percentages: 29.9% for DSP and House Manager staff, 24.9% for RNs, 28.1% for QIDPs, and 21% for all staff not previously mentioned. - Program-related expenditures, e.g., supervision, supplies, etc. The Program Support Cost is set at 5.6% of the Program Component costs, developed from provider cost surveys based on the proportion of reported program support expenses relative to Program Component costs. The Program Support Cost is effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval. - Utilization factors - Administration, e.g., administrative salaries, staff travel, office space and expenses; and - Transportation of individuals. The following additional factors may influence the standard methodology and are the basis for rate variations. When all factors are equal, the rates produced by the standard methodology would be the same. A differential may be included in the rate for the level of expertise and skill of specific professional staff; the differential will again be uniform across all providers. Regional Wage Factor: Beginning 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval, the OA will be implementing a Regional Wage Factor for all CILA Rate Methodologies to include the 24 Hour Stabilization Services. The Regional Wage Factor is part of the Guidehouse Rate Study and is based on an analysis of reported provider costs, required local minimum wage increases, the consumer price index and BLS wage data. Guidehouse determined a factor of 15% for the Regional Wage Factor would be necessary to keep pace with higher wage increases in the Chicago metro and collar counties of Illinois. Customers living and receiving CILA services in Chicago and collar counties will have their CILA Rates calculated using increased wage reimbursement and ERE with the Regional Wage Factor. Once the rates are established, rates may be adjusted through contractual amendments subject to cost of living increases appropriated by the Illinois General Assembly, through negotiations during contract renewals, or through subsequent calls for Request for Applications. The rates for 24-Hour Stabilization Services were last set and reviewed in 2019. The rates were reviewed and updated as of 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval. Training and Counseling Services for Unpaid Caregivers The counseling rate for unpaid care givers is identical to the standard statewide rate currently used in the waiver for participants receiving Individual Counseling services. The rate is based on available cost data for licensed social workers on contract with traditional developmental disabilities agencies. The rate is subject to cost of living adjustments when enacted. The rate was last set and reviewed in 2020. Reimbursement for training for unpaid care givers is based on usual and customary charges for the tuition or fees to attend the program. Transportation, meals, and lodging to attend training are not included. Reimbursement for training for unpaid care Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 26 of 302 12/16/2022givers is not subject to cost of living adjustments. The rate was last set and reviewed in 2020. Remote Support Equipment: Services are based on the manufacturer's suggested retail price or usual and customary charge defined as: The current retail price of an equipment item that is recommended by the product's manufacturer. If a vendor of equipment is also the manufacturer, the vendor may establish a suggested retail price provided that the price is equal to or less than the suggested retail price or monthly lease amount for the same or a comparable item recommended by one or more other manufacturers. Two bids are required for approval when purchasing Remote Support Equipment and Ongoing Monitoring from the same vendor. If an individual is unable to obtain two bids, they will submit the single bid along with the explanation why they were unable to obtain a second bid. Valid reasons could include a list of providers they contacted who did not respond, providers they contacted who do not provide coverage in the area they reside, etc. If the reason provided is valid, the request for service will be processed. If the reason is not valid, the OA will follow up with the participant to determine if there is valid rationale for only submitting one bid. Per-individual annual cost limits govern the use of these services. Ongoing monitoring: Rates are usual and customary. Payments are subject to prior approval by the Operating Agency. Two bids are required for approval and can be taken into account when purchasing Remote Support - Equipment from the same vendor. Per-individual annual cost limits govern the use of these services. If an individual is unable to obtain two bids, they will submit the single bid along with the explanation why they were unable to obtain a second bid. Valid reasons could include a list of providers they contacted who did not respond, providers they contacted who do not provide coverage in the area they reside, etc. If the reason provided is valid, the request for service will be processed. If the reason is not valid, the OA will follow up with the participant to determine if there is valid rationale for only submitting one bid. Per-individual annual cost limits govern the use of these services. Appendix A: Waiver Administration and Operation State Line of Authority for Waiver Operation.

Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 28 of 302 12/16/2022Healthcare and Family Services (HFS), as the Medicaid Agency (MA), maintains an interagency agreement with the Illinois Department of Human Services, Division of Developmental Disabilities (IDHS-DDD) as the Operating Agency (OA), which outlines the HCBS waiver responsibilities of both agencies. The interagency agreement is reviewed annually and amended if necessary. The OA is responsible for determination of customer eligibility, person centered plan (PCP) development, budgeting, enrolling and certifying waiver providers, assuring PCPs are implemented, and that services and providers meet standards established in the approved waiver and governing rules. The MA is responsible for enrolling providers in Medicaid; providing oversight, consultation and monitoring of waiver operations; processing federal claims; and maintaining an appeal process. The MA conducts all waiver appeal hearings and issues final determination decisions. The MA does not delegate this function to the OA. The MA provides independent, trained hearing officers for all appeal hearings. The MA's Waiver Unit reviews and approves all OA rules and policies prior to them being presented to the MA's Medical Policy Review Committee for final review and approval. The OA consults the MA about all changes in payment rate and methodologies. All changes must be approved by the MA prior to implementation. The MA provides the OA data, reports, or information as may be required to ensure compliance with State and Federal licensure and certification requirements and quality monitoring responsibilities. The MA and OA both conduct routine oversight monitoring of the fiscal and program activities to assure that the State meets the federal assurances identified in the waiver. The MA contracts with a federally certified Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) to assist the MA in its role of an administrative oversight for the Adults with Developmental Disabilities waiver. The OA's Bureau of Quality Management conducts their reviews. The OA's monitoring tools are reviewed annually and approved by the MA prior to implementation. The MA uses the Raosoft sample size calculator to determine the number of record reviews for both the QIO and OA. The sampling methodology is based on a statistically valid approach that uses a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error. The MA selects the customer sample from the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) using claims for waiver services in a specific period for the QIO to review. The QIO conducts record reviews and onsite provider reviews. The onsite provider reviews are more comprehensive than the record reviews. The QIO conducts onsite reviews of eight case management offices each year, with six customers reviewed at each office. The onsite reviews assess how the waiver program operates overall reviewing components of customer eligibility, PCPs, provider qualifications, health and safety, care coordination, and how the system operates and communicates customer needs and issues. Record reviews examine customer eligibility, PCPs, and health and welfare. The QIO submits a report of findings to the MA at the conclusion of each onsite review and record review. The report consists of a summary of findings for each customer record reviewed, as well as a summary of overall findings detailed by Performance Measure. Remediation activities are tracked by the OA and MA to ensure 100% remediation of findings. Timeframes for completion of remediation will be reported in 30, 60, 90, or greater than 90 days. Remediation activities will be consistent with the approved activities detailed within each Performance Measure. The MA and OA will work collaboratively to ensure remediation occurs within the required time frames. The QIO then performs remediation validation of all findings at each review site. The OA approves the completed remediation tracking spreadsheet and sends it to the MA. The OA selects the customer sample from the total number of customers enrolled in the waiver and are submitting claims for waiver services during a specific period for their Bureau of Quality Management to review. The MA holds quarterly meetings with the OA to review program administration and evaluate system performance. Quarterly meetings also discuss broad topics, onsite reviews, and remediation activities unless circumstances warrant communication prior to these meetings. The agencies also communicate regularly to follow up on issues raised during quarterly meetings. In addition, MA/OA staff communicate regularly regarding any issues that arise relating to administration of the waiver. These topics include general waiver administration, quality improvement strategies, HCBS Rule transition, etc. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 29 of 302 12/16/2022Appendix A: Waiver Administration and Operation Use of Contracted Entities.

There is a contract between the Medicaid agency and/or the operating agency (when authorized by the Medicaid agency) and each local/regional non-state entity that sets forth the responsibilities and performance requirements of the local/regional entity. The contract(s) under which private entities conduct waiver operational functions are available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency (if applicable). Specify the nature of these entities and complete items A-5 and A-6: Appendix A: Waiver Administration and Operation Responsibility for Assessment of Performance of Contracted and/or Local/Regional Non-State Entities. Specify the state agency or agencies responsible for assessing the performance of contracted and/or local/regional non-state entities in conducting waiver operational and administrative functions: 5. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 31 of 302 12/16/2022The Operating Agency (OA) is responsible for oversight of the ISCs and FMS entities. The Medicaid Agency (MA) conducts routine monitoring of ISC performance by selecting a statically valid representative sample of customer files. The OA conducts routine monitoring of ISCs and FMS entities by selecting a sample of customer files. The MA is responsible for assessing the performance of contracted entities in conducting waiver operational and administrative functions. In the MA's agreement with the OA, the MA has specified for each waiver performance measure the following: responsibility for data collection; frequency of data collection/generation; sampling approach; responsible party for data aggregation and analysis; frequency of data aggregation and analysis; data source; and remediation. For each performance measure, the data source varies according to the performance measure; for many of the measures, the sources are OA reports and BQM record reviews. The data source for some measures includes customer/guardian satisfaction surveys. The OA collects this data through a representative sample of records, based on the specific performance measure. The OA is required to submit quarterly reports, using the format required by the MA, on specific performance measures, which are described in MA's agreement with the OA. For each performance measure, the waiver specifies numerators, denominators, sampling approaches, data sources, etc. The OA presents the results to the MA in quarterly meetings. The waiver provider manual includes sanctions for failure to meet requirements for submissions of quality and performance measures. As part of the OA's quality oversight and monitoring of the waiver providers, the BQM performs onsite audits of the customer PCPs through Record Reviews. Upon completion of record reviews, the BQM provides a summary of findings by measure and a plan and Waiver specific summary report of findings and recommendations as appropriate. The report includes: Summary of non-compliance related to specific performance measures; Overall summary of record review findings; and recommendations for remediation of non-compliance. The OA follows-up with the agencies to ensure remediation occurs within the required time frames. The MA contracts with a federally certified Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) to assist the MA in its role of an administrative oversight for the Adults with Developmental Disabilities Waiver. The QIO looks at the provider's staff training documents, the amount of training hours for each staff person, the current licensure's and the results of the background checks. These documents are reviewed as part of onsite Comprehensive Provider Reviews; the QIO visits eight ISCs each year throughout Illinois, with six customers included in each site's sample. Sites and customers are designated by and randomly selected by the MA, respectively. The MA's ongoing quality monitoring includes sharing of reports from QIO reviews with the OA as well as directly with the review site. Sites are notified of findings and must complete the Remediation Tracking Spreadsheet. If the site scores less than 90% on their overall performance, the OA will request a Corrective Action Plan as well. Review sites must submit the Remediation Tracking Spreadsheet and plan of correction to the OA for its review and any necessary follow up or clarification. The OA must provide a copy of its approval of the Remediation Tracking Spreadsheet to the MA. In addition, MA/OA staff communicates regularly regarding any issues that arise relating to the administration of the waiver. These topics include general waiver administration, quality improvement strategies, HCBS Rule transition, etc. The MA and OA hold quarterly meetings to discuss broad topics, site reviews and remediation activities unless circumstances warrant communication prior to these meetings. The agencies also communicate regularly to follow up on issues raised during quarterly meetings. Appendix A: Waiver Administration and Operation Assessment Methods and Frequency. Describe the methods that are used to assess the performance of contracted and/or local/regional non-state entities to ensure that they perform assigned waiver operational and administrative functions in accordance with waiver requirements. Also specify how frequently the performance of contracted and/or local/regional non-state entities is assessed:6. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 32 of 302 12/16/2022 Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 33 of 302 12/16/2022The following describes the oversight of the Independent Service Coordination Agencies (ISCs) and FMS entities. The Medicaid Agency (MA) and the Operating Agency (OA) maintain separate but complementary processes to monitor customer welfare, service access, and quality. The reviews are not conducted concurrently. There is some duplication of review criteria for the MA and OA reviews, but the same criteria are not utilized by the MA and OA. The annual reviews referenced in this section by the OA are part of continued certification that the ISCs are complying with all administrative rules and policies for the OA's Waiver Program. The MA's monitoring activity is not intended to replicate the OA's reviews. The QIO performs two types of onsite reviews: Record Reviews and Comprehensive Provider Reviews. Record reviews are done through the state, based on a randomly drawn representative sample size. As noted above, there are eight Comprehensive Provider Reviews at ISCs with a total of six customers at each site. In addition to the record review, the QIO also conducts two site visits to Community Service Providers and interviews with customers and staff from the ISC and community service provider agencies involved in their care and services. Oversight of ISCs: Annually: OA staff conduct annual on-site surveys or record reviews that focus on compliance with the requirements of the OA's provider manual, as well as contractual requirements. All assessments and reviews may be done more frequently if needed. The OA may conduct more frequent assessments or reviews based on a variety of reasons that may be the result of customer/family caregiver complaints, billing issues or a complaint, among others. These actions may occur if numerous complaints are received for the same agency. The survey protocol includes staff qualifications and training, 24-hour accessibility for emergencies, a review of the pre- admission screening process (documentation of required assessments, eligibility determinations, informed choice and selection of services, and conflict of interest), and review of the Individual Service and Support Advocacy process (documentation of required visits, participation in PCP development and approval, and annual re-determinations of eligibility). Agencies are notified in writing of any deficiencies and are required to complete the Remediation Tracking Spreadsheet and submit a plan of correction to the OA, including timeframes (for all findings that cannot be corrected immediately while the reviewers are on site), if the agency scores less than 90% on their overall performance. ISC providers must submit the corrective action plan to the OA within 14 calendar days of the exit and are required to develop a plan that will correct all findings, other than those corrected immediately while the reviewers are on site, within 60 calendar days. OA staff review the plan of correction and, if acceptable, approve it. Reports are completed and sent to the ISC agencies after the review, generally within 30 days. ISC agencies are prescribed a timeframe for completing corrective actions identified in the review. For issues of health, safety and welfare, the timeframe is generally 30 calendar days (or less depending on the severity); for most corrective actions the timeframe is 60 calendar days. If corrective action is not completed in its entirety, a second review is conducted with further corrective action. The OA may initiate contract action, up to and including termination, for an agency with extensive corrective action expectations or issues that jeopardize health, safety, and welfare of customers. Oversight of an FMS entity(ies): Annually: OA staff conduct annual desk surveys that focus on compliance with the requirements of the OA's provider manual, as well as contractual requirements. All assessments and reviews may be done more frequently if needed. The OA may conduct more frequent assessments or reviews based on a variety of reasons that may be the result of customer/family caregiver complaints, billing issues or a complaint, among others. These actions may occur if numerous complaints are received for the same FMS entity. The survey protocol includes staff qualifications, training, and background checks as well as personal support worker Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 34 of 302 12/16/2022(PSW) eligibility and PSW background checks. The FMS entity is notified in writing of any deficiencies and is required to complete the Remediation Tracking Spreadsheet and submit a plan of correction to the OA, including timeframes (for all findings that cannot be corrected immediately while the reviewers are on site), if the FMS entity scores less than 90% on their overall performance. FMS providers must submit the corrective action plan to the OA within 14 calendar days of the exit and are required to develop a plan that will correct all findings, other than those corrected immediately while the reviewers are on site, within 60 calendar days. OA staff review the plan of correction and, if acceptable, approve it. Reports are completed and sent to the FMS entity after the review, generally within 30 days. The FMS entity(ies) is prescribed a timeframe for completing corrective actions identified in the review. For issues of health, safety and welfare, the timeframe is generally 30 calendar days (or less depending on the severity); for most corrective actions the timeframe is 60 calendar days. If corrective action is not completed in its entirety, a second review is conducted with further corrective action. The OA may initiate contract action, up to and including termination, for an FMS entity with extensive correction action expectations or issues that jeopardize health, safety, and welfare of customers. Summary reports of the reviews are shared with and discussed with the MA at the Quarterly Waiver Management meetings. Appendix A: Waiver Administration and Operation Distribution of Waiver Operational and Administrative Functions. In the following table, specify the entity or entities that have responsibility for conducting each of the waiver operational and administrative functions listed ( check each that applies): In accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7431.10, when the Medicaid agency does not directly conduct a function, it supervises the performance of the function and establishes and/or approves policies that affect the function. All functions not performed directly by the Medicaid agency must be delegated in writing and monitored by the Medicaid Agency. Note: More than one box may be checked per item. Ensure that Medicaid is checked when the Single State Medicaid Agency (1) conducts the function directly; (2) supervises the delegated function; and/or (3) establishes and/or approves policies related to the function.

This database records demographic and clinical information regarding the individual and his/her circumstances, services currently received, and services needed. As appropriations are available, individuals are selected for authorization for waiver services via a process that focuses on the individual's amount of time waiting (after the 18th birthday) in the seeking services category. Entrance to the Waiver for Adults with Developmental Disabilities of otherwise eligible applicants is deferred via this process until capacity becomes available due to turnover or the appropriation of additional funding by the State's legislature. The intake assessment tool and corresponding PUNS manual have been incorporated into the Independent Service Coordination (ISC) Manual and is available on the Operating Agency's website at: https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=31201. The State gives service priority to eligible customers according to the following priority population criteria in priority order, beginning with the most critical need: 1) Individuals who are subject to abuse, neglect, and/or homelessness. 2) Individuals who are youth in care of the Department of Children and Family Services and are approaching the age of 18 and individuals who are aging out of children's residential services funded by the Division of Developmental Disabilities. 3) Individuals who are placed in state-operated developmental centers. 4) Bogard class members as defined in the Bogard Consent Decree and amended Bogard Consent Decree. 5) Individuals registered on DHS' database for Home and Community Based Waiver Services (PUNS). 6) Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities who reside in state-operated mental health hospitals. The number of customers served each year will be based on available appropriations. New enrollees will be selected from the PUNS database, a database maintained by the OA of individuals potentially in need of state-funded DD services within the next five years.

The ISC agencies employ the QIDPs. Per contractual agreement with the OA, the ISCs are prohibited from providing direct service to waiver customers. c. Level of Care Criteria. Fully specify the level of care criteria that are used to evaluate and reevaluate whether an individual needs services through the waiver and that serve as the basis of the state's level of care instrument/tool. Specify the level of care instrument/tool that is employed. State laws, regulations, and policies concerning level of care criteria and the level of care instrument/tool are available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency (if applicable), including the instrument/tool utilized. All applicants for waiver services are required to have a Pre-Admission Screening and Record Review (PASRR) completed to determine if waiver services are appropriate or institutional care is required. If waiver services are indicated, an Inventory of Client and Agency Planning (ICAP) is completed. The ICAP is a medical review that consists of a physical examination by a qualified professional, medical history and medication review, and other assessments as needed to determine what service needs are required. The ICAP gathers information on maladaptive behavior index, adaptive behavior index and service score and level. The psychological assessment gathers information on cognitive/intellectual functioning, developmental history, educational background, adaptive skill level, multi-axial diagnosis that includes a primary diagnosis, and recommendations for future service delivery. The physical assessment gathers information on the individual's physical condition. The psychiatric assessment gathers information on the individual's psychiatric history, description of intellectual functioning, memory functioning, orientation, affect, suicidal or homicidal ideation, current attitude, motor behaviors, judgment, thought processes and medication history. For ongoing redetermination of waiver eligibility, an annual ICAP is required. An evaluation and periodic (at least annual) reevaluations of the customer's need for the level of care provided in an ICF/IID, as defined by 42 CFR 440.150 (1996) is required in Administrative Rule 89. Ill. Adm. Code 120.80. d. Level of Care Instrument(s).

A different instrument is used to determine the level of care for the waiver than for institutional care under the state plan. Describe how and why this instrument differs from the form used to evaluate institutional level of care and explain how the outcome of the determination is reliable, valid, and fully comparable. Process for Level of Care Evaluation/Reevaluation: Per 42 CFR \u00a7441.303(c)(1), describe the process for evaluating waiver applicants for their need for the level of care under the waiver. If the reevaluation process differs from the evaluation process, describe the differences: f. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 61 of 302 12/16/2022The Operating Agency (OA) contracts with Independent Service Coordination (ISC) entities that employ Qualified Intellectual Disabilities Professionals (QIDPs) to complete the level of care evaluations and reevaluations. Administrative Rule 89 Ill. Adm. Code 120.140 requires that prior to Medicaid waiver enrollment, the PASRR agent shall assess the individual using the same level of care criteria as used for placement into a State-Operated Developmental Center or community ICF/IID. Program services are an alternative to ICF/IID placement. The criteria for this determination is contained in IDHS's rule at 89 Ill. Adm. Code 140.642. Individuals demonstrating the ability to function independently shall not be eligible for program services. An evaluation and periodic (at least annual) reevaluation of the customer's need for the level of care provided in an ICF/IID, as defined by 42 CFR 440.150 (1996), is required in Administrative Rule 89. Ill. Adm. Code 120.80. As part of the initial level of care determination process, staff of the contracted agencies are responsible for performing or arranging for necessary assessments and collecting other needed information to determine level of care. The ISC reviews the assessment results and other available information against the level of care criteria and guidance in the screening manual for developmental disabilities. The ISC uses the totality of the information available and their best clinical judgment in making the determination of eligibility. Assessment information and level of care determinations are documented on forms specified by the OA. Level of care determinations are transmitted electronically to the OA via the Reporting of Community Services (ROCS) system. The redetermination process is essentially the same as the eligibility process, except the ongoing level of care determination is based on a current ICAP, individual assessments and other information from the personal planning process in conjunction with personal knowledge of the customer. Level of care redeterminations are documented on a form specified by the OA and are transmitted electronically to the OA via the ROCS system. The OA uses a combination of assessments to determine eligibility, including the ICAP, plus psychological, physical, and psychiatric assessments, as warranted by the individual's related condition(s). ISC's complete an assessment with the customer using a statewide standardized discovery process developed by the OA with stakeholder input. The ICAP gathers information on maladaptive behavior index, adaptive behavior index and service score and level. The psychological assessment gathers information on cognitive/intellectual functioning, developmental history, educational background, adaptive skill level, multi-axial diagnosis that includes a primary diagnosis, and recommendations for future service delivery. The physical assessment gathers information on the individual's physical condition that includes a review of the following components: skin, head, eyes and vision, ear and hearing, mouth, neck, lymph nodes, breasts, peripheral circulation, male genitalia and hernias, female genitalia, rectum, musculoskeletal system, and the neurological system. The psychiatric assessment gathers information on the individual's psychiatric history, description of intellectual functioning, memory functioning, orientation, affect, suicidal or homicidal ideation, current attitude, motor behaviors, judgment, thought processes and medication history. The discovery process collects and compiles information about the customer's strengths, needs, preferences, desired outcomes, health, and risk factors. The discovery process guides an interview with the customer. Topics covered include the customer's self-description, communication needs, relationships, living arrangements, work, abilities, health/medication issues, recreation, and community connections. The discovery process is available upon request from the OA. The OA requires the ISC staff to review and make the determination based on the assessments that are performed and the information gathered. The MA will provide oversight of the OA for monitoring of redeterminations of the Level of Care though two methods: 1. The OA conducts quarterly and annual reviews of the redetermination process. The OA provides this data to the MA and it is available on the OA website for public transparency. The link to the OA's website is located here: http://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=97777 The MA reviews this data at quarterly waiver meetings. If trends are identified that reveal noncompliance, an action plan would be developed to ensure compliance is achieved. 2. In addition to the OA assessment review and MA oversight, the contracted Quality Improvement Organization reviews a sample of records to ensure compliance. These reports are shared with the Waiver Quality Management team. If noncompliance is identified related to a waiver PM, the Remediation Tracking Spreadsheet is completed. If the noncompliance is not related to a PM, a corrective action plan would be developed to address the issue. Reevaluation Schedule.

ISCs conduct Level of Care (LOC) determinations. The state ensures LOC determinations are done in an accurate and timely fashion. The state maintains a tracking database in which information about customer LOC determinations is contained. This database contains individual customer level and item level information from the LOC determination tools. Information is collected on a continuous basis. The OA extracts information from these databases regarding the timeliness of the eligibility determinations and redeterminations. The information is summarized in quarterly management reports. The databases also contain edits that ensure that only customers who meet the LOC eligibility threshold are determined eligible for the program. For those functions delegated to the OA such as LOC determinations, the MA is responsible for oversight and monitoring to assure compliance with federal assurances and performance measures. The MA monitors both compliance levels and timeliness of remediation by the OA. The MA's sampling methodology is based on a statistically valid sampling methodology using a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error. The MA will pull the sample annually. ii.

If the justification is inadequate and/or the reassessment does not result in the required scoring, the waiver eligibility will be discontinued and the OA will assist the customer with accessing other supports and services. Federal claims will be adjusted and the OA will provide technical assistance or training to ISC staff. Remediation must be completed within 60 days. The OA is responsible for seeing that individual issues are resolved. The OA provides quarterly reports of these findings and remediation activities to the MA. Staff of the two State agencies review the reports on a quarterly basis.

Appendix B: Participant Access and Eligibility B-7: Freedom of Choice Freedom of Choice. As provided in 42 CFR \u00a7441.302(d), when an individual is determined to be likely to require a level of care for this waiver, the individual or his or her legal representative is: informed of any feasible alternatives under the waiver; andi. given the choice of either institutional or home and community-based services.ii. Procedures. Specify the state's procedures for informing eligible individuals (or their legal representatives) of the feasible alternatives available under the waiver and allowing these individuals to choose either institutional or waiver services. Identify the form(s) that are employed to document freedom of choice. The form or forms are available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency (if applicable). Customer choice is a requirement of the waiver program as established in Illinois Administrative Code 120.80. The Independent Service Coordination Agencies (ISC) contracted with the Operating Agency (OA) inform customers, and/or their legal guardians, about their options during the level of care determination process. The ISC presents the customer/legal representative with all service options, including both community-based Waiver services and ICF/IID services the customer is eligible to receive, regardless of availability, in sufficient detail so they are able to make informed choices. If the customer/legal representative does not speak English, has limited proficiency or is non-verbal, the ISC makes the appropriate accommodation. Acceptable accommodations may include use of staff with secondary language skills, translation services, oral assistance, and communication devices. The ISC provides the customer/legal representative with additional information and materials on the service options they choose to pursue and arranges for and facilitates conversations with potential service providers including visits to the potential providers as indicated. Upon enrollment and annually thereafter each customer is given a statement of rights by the ISC. Selection of providers is discussed in the statement of rights brochure. The statement of rights can be found at: http://www.dhs.state.il.us/onenetlibrary/12/documents/Forms/IL462-1201.pdf. The ISCs are trained to educate customers and provide information to the customer on the available providers, their settings if service is to be delivered outside of the home, and to assist customers, if needed in making an informed choice of providers. The IL 462-1238 form, Choice of Supports and Services, specifically documents the decision to choose Waiver services as an alternative to ICF/IID services. This form also states that choice of supports and services may be changed in the future. The form is signed by the customer/legal representative. The form is available in English and Spanish (IL 462- 1238S). a. Maintenance of Forms. Per 45 CFR \u00a792.42, written copies or electronically retrievable facsimiles of Freedom of Choice forms are maintained for a minimum of three years. Specify the locations where copies of these forms are maintained. Copies of the IL 462-1238 forms are available in English and Spanish and are maintained by the Independent Service Coordination (ISC) Agency. The OA requires that ISCs adhere to the OA's standards and policies which require that all written and/or electronic documentation and forms related to all evaluations, reevaluations and customer care are maintained for a minimum period of five years. Active customer records can never be purged regardless of the five-year minimum time-period. ISCs are required to maintain records in a secure, confidential location that is readily accessible during this period. Records are kept securely at the local ISCs or at a secure storage facility until they can be purged by the ISCs. b.

The service shall offer adult skill-building activities, including opportunities for community exploration, inclusion and integration, based upon the customer's current, emerging and newly discovered interests and preferences. The activities shall support the acquisition of new skills as well as support for self-determination, the development of relationships, community integration, employment exploration and/or community contribution (providing for discussion of and general exposure to different types of employment with the goal being to enable the customer to identify and develop interests, cultivate relevant skills, and seek out training). The skill acquisition/maintenance activities should include formal strategies for teaching the individualized skills and include the intended outcome for the customer. Individualized progress for the skill acquisition/maintenance activities should be routinely reviewed and evaluated with revisions made as necessary to promote continued skill acquisition. As the customer develops new skills, his or her training should move along a continuum of habilitation services offered toward greater independence and self-reliance. CDS is a site-based service with community integration. Community integration must be offered to the customer on a weekly basis at a minimum. Planning for community integrated services should be based on the customer's interests and needs and identified in the customer's PCP. CDS coordinates and provides supports for valued and active participation in integrated weekday activities that build on the customer's interests, preferences, gifts, and strengths while working toward the customer's goals with regard to community involvement and membership. CDS services are aimed at developing activities and/or skills acquisition to support or further integrate community opportunities outside of the customer's home, to foster independence, autonomy or career exploration and encourage the development of a full life in his/her community. Services are typically provided in group settings, but within these settings, customers may receive services as part of a smaller group. If the customer requires individualized services based on the needs identified in the customer's PCP, the customer may receive CDS services on an individualized basis. CDS provides a range of adaptive skills training in the areas of motor development, attention span, safety, problem solving, quantitative skills, and capacity for independent living. It also enhances the customer's ability to engage in productive work activities through a focus on such habilitative goals as compliance, attendance, and task completion. CDS also includes training and supports designed to maintain skills and functioning and to prevent or slow regression. Activities consist of job exploration activities (not competitive integrated employment) or volunteer work, recreation, educational experiences in natural community settings, maintaining family contacts and purposeful activities and services where persons without disabilities are present. For working-age customers receiving CDS who are not also working in individualized competitive integrated employment or self-employment, this service includes and can be exclusively focused on, opportunities for exploration, learning and skill development focused on encouraging pursuit of, and aptitudes for, individualized competitive integrated employment or self-employment. CDS shall support and enhance, rather than supplant, the customer's involvement in public education, postsecondary education/training, individualized competitive integrated employment or self-employment, and services designed to lead to these types of employment. For customers who are aging, CDS provides supports for integrated age-appropriate activities. CDS focuses on enabling the customer to attain or maintain his or her maximum functional level and shall be coordinated with any other paid or unpaid services in the customer's PCP. In addition, CDS reinforces skills or lessons taught in other settings. CDS developmental supports can include the reduction of maladaptive behaviors through positive behavioral supports and other methods. Personal care is a component of day habilitation services when necessary to meet the needs of the customer but shall Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 76 of 302 12/16/2022not comprise the entirety of the service. Meals provided as part of these services shall not constitute a \"full nutritional regimen\" (three meals per day).

Activities are expected to increase the customer's opportunity to build connections within his/her local community and provide the following: Supports to participate in age-appropriate community activities, groups, associations or clubs to develop social networks; Supports to participate in community opportunities related to the development of hobbies or leisure/cultural interests or to promote personal health and wellness (e.g., yoga class, walking group, etc.); Supports to participate in adult education and postsecondary education classes; Supports to participate in formal/informal associations or community/neighborhood groups; Supports to participate in volunteer opportunities; Supports to participate in opportunities focused on training and education for self-determination and self- advocacy; Supports for learning to navigate the local community, including learning to use public transportation and/or private transportation available in the local area; Supports to maintain relationships with members of the broader community (e.g. neighbors, co-workers and other community members who do not have disabilities and who are not paid or unpaid caregivers) through natural opportunities and invitations that may occur. CDS cannot be provided in the customer's home or during the same time the customer is receiving Residential Habilitation since community integration is part of that service. Specify applicable (if any) limits on the amount, frequency, or duration of this service: CDS may be attended Monday through Friday. The annual rate is spread over a State fiscal year maximum of 1,200 hours for any combination of day programs.

Services are developed in accordance with the needs of the customer and include supports to foster independence and encourage development of a full life in the community, based upon what is important to and for the customer, as documented in his or her Person Centered Plan (PCP). This includes assisting and teaching customers to attain new and maintain and improve existing skills in areas of self-care, daily living, adaptive skills, leisure, and community integration, including building and maintaining relationships. These supports include adaptive skill development, assistance with activities of daily living, community inclusion, transportation, adult educational supports, social and leisure skill development to assist the customer to reside in the most integrated setting appropriate to his/her needs and desires. In addition, Residential Habilitation provides necessary nursing assessment, direction and monitoring by a registered professional nurse, and support services and assistance by a registered professional nurse or a licensed practical nurse to ensure the customer's health and welfare. It also includes administration and/or oversight of the administration of medications consistent with the Illinois Nursing and Advanced Practice Nursing Act (225 ILSC 65) and the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Administrative Act. Nursing services are considered an integral part of Residential Habilitation services. Meeting the routine nursing needs of customers receiving Residential Habilitation is the responsibility of the residential service provider who must employ or contract with a professional nurse to perform their professional duties providing the oversight and training of direct support staff. Nursing supports are part-time and limited; 24- hour nursing supports, similar to those provided in a nursing facility (NF) or Intermediate Care Facility for individuals with Developmental Disabilities (ICF/IID), are not available to customers in the waiver. These services are in addition to any Medicaid State Plan nursing services (or EPSDT nursing, if under 21 years old) for which the customer may qualify. Residential Habilitation provides personal care and protective oversight and supervision. Residential Habilitation also includes the reduction of maladaptive behaviors through positive behavioral supports and other methods as reviewed and approved by the Human Rights Committee. Payment is not made, directly or indirectly, to members of the customer's immediate family. Transportation provided as a component part of Residential Habilitation is included in the rate paid to providers of Residential Habilitation services. The Residential Habilitation provider is responsible for developing and carrying out an Implementation Strategy for each customer served. The Implementation Strategy is based on the customer's needs and desires as indicated in his or her PCP. The Strategy documents how, when, where and by whom Residential Habilitation needs and desired outcomes will be met, put into action and addressed. Some types of Residential Habilitation include payment made for the cost of room and board. Costs covered are building maintenance, upkeep and improvement (other than such costs for modification or adaptations to a residential site required to assure the health and safety of residents, or to meet the requirements of the applicable life safety code). Room & board costs are removed from the rate the State claims for federal match. The customer and/or the customer's guardian, as applicable, have the right to choose the residential service provider. The residential service provider is responsible for managing the residential habilitation services for the customer based on the customer's PCP. Residential Habilitation services are currently provided in homes of up to eight people. All Residential Habilitation settings must fully comply with the requirements of the HCBS Setting Rule. Residential Habilitation payments provide the following: a) All supervision from direct support staff, QIDP, Supervisors and other appropriate staff; b) All nursing provided in the residence for medication administration oversight, physician ordered protocols and procedures, charting, or other supports as per physician's orders; c) Transportation (excluding transportation costs associated with other waiver or Medicaid services); d) Programmatic supplies and fees; e) Program Support costs. These costs are specific to the program but are not billable such as quality assurance activities; f) Consultant costs, which provides reimbursement for consultant services that may be necessary to provide or update assessments and develop various therapy plans; and g) General and Administrative fees for waiver services.

Types of Residential Habilitation Services: 24-Hour Shift Staff Community Integrated Living Arrangement (24-Hour CILA) - Customers receive a comprehensive individualized array of residential habilitation, individual support services and supports under the direction of a provider support team within the local agency. These homes have on-site shift staff available during all times when customers are present, unless an approved remote supports service is in place that affords a customer more independence or there is a documented safety plan that allows the customer to remain home alone for a specific number of hours per day. Staff provide both scheduled and unscheduled supports and services as needed by customers. This service can be provided in individual and provider owned and controlled settings where one to eight unrelated customers live. Intermittent Community Integrated Living Arrangement (Intermittent CILA) - A living arrangement provided in a group home, family home, a customer's own home or apartment where eight or fewer unrelated customers with developmental disabilities reside under supervision of a residential provider agency. Customers receive a comprehensive individualized array of residential habilitation, individual support services and supports under the direction of a provider support team within the local agency. This level of support serves customers whose PCP documents they do not require 24-hour and regular on-site staff presence. Intermittent residential services have staff on call 24 hours per day. On-site staff are available to provide both scheduled and unscheduled supports and services as needed by the customers served and as specified in each customer's PCP.

No more than two customers with developmental disabilities may reside with any single host family (Rule 115.550 a.) unless a waiver is granted according to Rule 115.550 c. Customers receive a comprehensive individualized array of residential habilitation, personal support services and supports under the direction of a provider support team within the local agency. The two support models are: a) Standard Host Family level: The residential setting is the full-time residence of the paid care givers. The live-in paid care givers own, lease or rent the residence and provide all necessary support for the customer. The live-in paid care givers arrange relief and vacation staff on their own schedule. Relief and vacation staff are required to be trained and have previously met all DSP hiring requirements. b) Comprehensive Host Family level: The residential setting may be owned, leased or rented by the customer(s), care givers or provider agency and may house either full or part-time paid care givers. In a Comprehensive Host Family CILA, shift staff employees are regularly scheduled as part of the comprehensive host family staffing and routinely share supervision, care and training responsibilities with the host family care givers, although shift staff never provide more than 50% of needed staff coverage.

The strategies are a component of the PCP and must be approved by the customer, family, responsible QIDP, ISC and the other members of the planning team. Trained team members implement the planned behavior services. The behavior consultant monitors progress on at least a monthly basis and more frequently if needed to address issues with the customer's outcomes. A progress report is prepared by the behavior consultant and sent to the support planning team every six months. This progress report is available to State staff upon request to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment. The behavior consultant supervises implementation of the behavior strategies. This includes training of the direct support staff and family to ensure that they apply the interventions properly, understand the specific services and outcomes for the customer being served, and know the procedures for reporting customer progress.

SEI services facilitate the maintenance and enhancement of employment which is aligned with a customer's interests, skills, desires and conditions of employment. It may also include self-employment. SEI services do not include supporting paid employment or a facility-based setting. The expected outcome of SEI is sustained competitive integrated employment that is well-matched to the customer's interests, strengths, priorities, and abilities, and that meets the customer's personal and career goals. Eligibility and Authorization: SEI services are available only to customers who are engaged in competitive integrated employment and who have been successfully closed and transitioning from supports provided by the Illinois Department of Human Services, Division of Rehabilitation Services, Vocational Rehabilitation program. SEI services are authorized only for employment opportunities for which customers are compensated at or above (the higher of) local, state, or federal minimum wage and to the same degree as the customary wage and benefit levels of employees performing the same work who do not have disabilities. SEI services may not supplant services typically available from the Division of Rehabilitation Services' Vocational Rehabilitation or are otherwise available under section 110 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Documentation must be maintained by the provider that the non-waiver employment services noted above (under section 110 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) have been successfully exhausted. SEI services must be reviewed no less than annually, coinciding with the development or revision of the PCP.

SEI services are individualized and provided at a ratio of 1:1, staff member to customer. Support Changes: The option to change the amount of supports provided is based on a change in needs and/or on an assessment of needs for the customer. Should the customer and staff recognize a need for a change in supports, the change should be developed as part of the customer's person-centered plan and implementation strategy. Support changes that have been identified and are included in the implementation strategy must be reviewed regularly, but at least annually, by the Independent Service Coordination Agency to determine if the customer and staff continue to believe the existing supports are appropriate, if the supports are effective, and if further changes in supports should occur.

Specify the state's policies concerning the conduct of criminal history and/or background investigations of individuals who provide waiver services (select one): No. Criminal history and/or background investigations are not required. Yes. Criminal history and/or background investigations are required. Specify: (a) the types of positions (e.g., personal assistants, attendants) for which such investigations must be conducted; (b) the scope of such investigations (e.g., state, national); and, (c) the process for ensuring that mandatory investigations have been conducted. State laws, regulations and policies referenced in this description are available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid or the operating agency (if applicable): a. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 142 of 302 12/16/2022(a) the types of positions (e.g., personal assistants, attendants) for which such investigations must be conducted; Criminal background checks with the Illinois State Police are required for direct service staff hired by agencies providing Residential Habilitation services, Community Day Services, Adult Day Service, Supported Employment - Individual Employment Support, Supported Employment - Small Group Supports, Self-Direction Assistance, Personal Support, or ISC entities. These agencies may not knowingly hire or retain any person in a full-time, part- time or contractual direct service position if that person has been convicted of committing or attempting to commit one or more of the offenses in the Illinois Health Care Worker Background Check Act (225 ILCS 64/25), unless the person obtains a waiver for the conviction. The Financial Management Service (FMS) entity/entities are required to obtain criminal background checks and not enroll or retain independent personal support workers (domestic employees) if the person has been convicted as described above. The FMS vendor obtains the criminal background check on behalf of all customers who hire independent personal support workers. The results are kept on file with the FMS vendor. (b) the scope of such investigations (e.g., state, national); The Medicaid Enrollment Agreement signed by the providers, as well as the contractual agreement signed by the FMS entities, includes the requirement for background investigations. The OA annually reviews compliance with this provision through the statistically valid sample of Waiver customers by obtaining evidence of the completed investigations by their providers. In addition, the OA obtains and reviews on-going reports from the FMS entities of the dates of the completed investigations for the workers they enroll. The results of these reviews are shared with the MA on a summary basis. The OA conducts a compliance review for each ISC entity to ensure compliance with contractual obligations. After conducting compliance reviews, the OA summarizes information on each performance indicator targeting the following users: the MA, the OA, ISCs and providers. The MA and OA review the statewide performance data during quarterly meetings. The summarized data assists the two agencies with identifying potentially problematic trends and tracks the effects of remediation efforts to improve performance. Similarly, detailed reports for each level of entity are shared quarterly. These reports provide the basis for trend identification and specific areas of problems, leading to remediation. When individual problems with existing provider qualifications and contract compliance are identified, there is an initial effort to resolve the situation. When compliance problems occur, the OA makes an initial request for corrective action. This corrective action request is tracked until there is a successful resolution. If there is not successful resolution, the OA may take contract action up to and including contract termination. Annually, the MA conducts comprehensive focused onsite reviews using a statewide sample of customer records. PCP implementation and satisfaction are monitored during these reviews. The MA submits findings from routine monitoring to the OA for follow-up and correction. The MA and OA meet quarterly to discuss summary reports that include statewide data and corrective action that has been taken by the OA. This provides an opportunity for both agencies to identify trends and issues, and to discuss remediation steps. (c) the process for ensuring that mandatory investigations have been conducted. The MA conducts routine programmatic and fiscal monitoring for the OA. The MA is responsible for oversight and monitoring to assure compliance with federal assurances and performance measures. The MA's sampling methodology is based on a statistically valid sampling methodology that pulls proportionate samples from the OA. The proportionate sampling methodology uses a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error. The MA will pull the sample annually. The Medicaid Agency (MA) initiated a provider enrollment system in Fiscal Year 2016 in response to requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The Illinois Medicaid Program Advanced Cloud Technology (IMPACT) system is a web-based system designed to improve provider access, and to ensure customers receive timely and high-quality Medicaid services, including services provided to Medicaid waiver customers. Providers must be enrolled in the IMPACT system prior to being reimbursed for services. Background checks are completed on each provider during Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 143 of 302 12/16/2022the enrollment process. Information about all convictions is shared with the MA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) for review and follow-up. Certain felony convictions will prevent providers from being enrolled in the IMPACT system. The decision to reject an enrollment application on the basis of a felony conviction is determined by the OIG. Providers must meet all qualifications and pass all screening checks to be approved and entered in IMPACT. A provider cannot be enrolled and serve Medicaid customers unless all mandatory screenings have been conducted. Providers must meet all qualifications and pass all screening checks to be approved and entered in IMPACT (HFS Inspector General's Office, the Illinois Department of Public Health's Health Care Worker Registry, a Healthcare Worker Background Check, the Illinois Department of Professional and Financial Regulation registry, etc.). The IMPACT system allows the MA to ensure 100% of licensed or certified providers continue to meet the required standards by performing automatic checks of the IL Department of Financial and Professional Regulation's licensure and certification database and exclusion databases. If a provider has a termination or lapse in licensure or certification or appears on an exclusion database, the MA will disenroll the provider and notify the OA. The waiver customer is notified, and a different provider is selected. To ensure an adequate network, both the MA and OA work with providers to correct any lapse in licensure or certification and to troubleshoot any issues with enrollment to regain approved provider status. Both the MA and OA monitor network capacity to ensure an adequate network. Similarly, for non-licensed/non-certified providers, the IMPACT system allows the MA to ensure 100% of providers continue to meet the required standards by performing automatic checks of the IL Department of Public Health's Healthcare Worker Registry and exclusion databases. If a provider has a disqualifying finding on the Healthcare Worker Registry or appears on an exclusion database, the provider is disenrolled and the information is shared with the OA. The waiver customer is notified, and a different provider is selected. To ensure an adequate network, both the MA and OA work with providers to correct any lapse in licensure or certification and to troubleshoot any issues with enrollment to regain approved provider status. Both the MA and OA monitors network capacity to ensure an adequate network. Abuse Registry Screening. Specify whether the state requires the screening of individuals who provide waiver services through a state-maintained abuse registry (select one): No. The state does not conduct abuse registry screening. Yes. The state maintains an abuse registry and requires the screening of individuals through this registry. Specify: (a) the entity (entities) responsible for maintaining the abuse registry; (b) the types of positions for which abuse registry screenings must be conducted; and, (c) the process for ensuring that mandatory screenings have been conducted. State laws, regulations and policies referenced in this description are available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency (if applicable): b. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 144 of 302 12/16/2022Per the Abused and Neglected Long Term Care Facility Residents Reporting Act (210 ILCS 30), the Illinois Department of Public Health maintains an adult abuse and neglect registry. The registry is called the Healthcare Worker Registry. Waiver providers are required by the OA to complete registry checks on all employees. Employees cannot be hired if they fail the registry checks. The results of the registry checks are documented by the provider. Abuse/neglect screenings are required for all domestic employees hired on or after July 1, 2007, who provide Personal Support or Temporary Assistance services. Such individuals may not be employed in any capacity until the employer has checked the individual against the Ill. Department of Public Health, Health Care Worker Registry and the Ill. Department of Children and Family Services Registry. The FMS entities conduct the registry checks for all personal support workers employed directly by the customer or their representative. Abuse/Neglect screenings are required for all individuals providing Residential Habilitation, Community Day Services, Supported Employment, Self-Direction Assistance, Personal Support, or Independent Service Coordination (ISC) entities. Such individuals may not be employed in any capacity until the employer has checked the individual against: -The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) Health Care Worker Registry, and the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) State Central Register (Children's Abuse and Neglect Tracking System - CANTS). If either database reports substantiated or indicated findings of physical or sexual abuse or egregious neglect, the person may not be employed. For providers who don't provide services to children (under the age of 18), the employee is authorized to begin providing services pending the outcome of the CANTS check. When determining whether to grant a waiver for employees or potential employees found on the CANTS registry, the OA reviews applications for a waiver based on individual circumstances. The factors considered include, but are not limited to, the following: - Circumstances surrounding the event, - Work history of the employee requesting the waiver, - Recommendation of employer or potential employer, - The provider's quality review and licensure survey results, - The length of time since the incident, - The age of the employee at the time of the incident, and - The results of a cross check in the Adult Registry. Further, any waiver would be granted for the employee or potential employee while working for the provider involved in the waiver request only. Should the employee change providers, the decision whether to grant a waiver would be considered again. The OA and the MA, through a representative sample, review providers and FMS entities for compliance with this requirement.

The relative or legal guardian must meet the same provider qualification criteria, and pass the required background checks, that are applicable to any provider rendering the same services. Parents, other relatives, and legal guardians may not provide host family services (i.e., foster care and other shared living arrangements) under Residential Habilitation services. This prohibition is specified in Illinois Administrative Code, available upon request from either the Medicaid Agency (MA) or Operating Agency (OA). Legally responsible relatives (i.e., spouses) may not be paid to provide waiver services, as specified in Appendix C- 2(d) above. The PCP governs the services to be provided, including those provided by relatives and legal guardians. For customers who exercise employer authority, the Financial Management Service (FMS) entity receives time sheets detailing the date and time of services delivered. The FMS entity conducts routine quality assurance activities. The ISC, plays a key role in monitoring the implementation of the PCP and reporting any non-compliant issues or problems to the OA if direct interventions by the ISC do not work. The OA through its representative sample, reviews Personal Support, Temporary Assistance and Non-Medical Transportation, regardless of the provider relationship. Payment arrangements to relatives and legal representatives may be reviewed and denied by the OA. Decisions to deny by the OA are subject to waiver appeal rights. Other policy. Specify: Open Enrollment of Providers. Specify the processes that are employed to assure that all willing and qualified providers have the opportunity to enroll as waiver service providers as provided in 42 CFR \u00a7431.51: Customers in the Adult Waiver and their families, guardian if applicable and ISC staff are responsible for selecting needed services and service providers, as the Adult Waiver is largely directed by customers and their families. The State does not impose barriers to the free choice of willing and qualified providers. The OA reviews and approves service providers for participation in the Adult Waiver based only on the provider qualifications specified in the Waiver. The MA enrolls all willing and qualified providers that are chosen by customers in the Adult Waiver and their families. Information regarding provider qualifications and program guidelines is continuously available on the OA's website at http://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=47336. This website lists all types of providers within the developmental disabilities service system, briefly describes what each does, lists requirements and qualifications, links those interested to regulatory documents and forms, and provides contact information. Potential providers must review the regulatory documents linked to the website. They must also complete the required forms for their provider type and submit them to the contact person listed. Each provider must complete a Medicaid Provider Enrollment agreement, which is a three-way agreement among the provider, OA, and MA.

The Medicaid Agency (MA) will conduct routine programmatic and fiscal monitoring for the Operating Agency (OA). For those functions delegated to the OA, the MA is responsible for oversight and monitoring to assure compliance with federal assurances and performance measures. The MA monitors both compliance levels and timeliness of remediation by the OA. The MA has developed queries within the Data Warehouse to review provider qualifications on a quarterly basis. The MA pulls reports by waiver provider type for both licensed and unlicensed providers to assure that they meet all the Illinois Medicaid Program Cloud Technology (IMPACT) system screening criteria and do not have any Office of Inspector General restrictions including exclusions or sanctions against their licenses. This is done for newly enrolled providers as well as existing providers. The reports will be reviewed and discussed during the quarterly Quality Management meetings. The IMPACT system allows the MA to ensure 100% of licensed or certified providers continue to meet the required standards by performing automatic checks of the IL Department of Financial and Professional Regulation's licensure and certification database and exclusion databases. If a provider has a termination or lapse in licensure or certification or appears on an exclusion database, the MA will disenroll the provider and notify the OA. The waiver customer is notified, and a different provider is selected. To ensure an adequate network, both the MA and OA work with providers to correct any lapse in licensure or certification and to troubleshoot any issues with enrollment to regain approved provider status. Similarly, for non-licensed/non-certified providers the IMPACT system allows the MA to ensure 100% of providers continue to meet the required standards by performing automatic checks of the IL Department of Public Health's Healthcare Worker Registry and exclusion databases. If a provider has a disqualifying finding on the Healthcare Worker Registry or appears on an exclusion database, the provider is disenrolled and the information is shared with the OA. The waiver customer is notified, and a different provider is selected. To ensure an adequate network, both the MA and OA work with providers to correct any lapse in licensure or certification and to troubleshoot any issues with enrollment to regain approved provider status. For training, the MA will request reports from the OA to verify that ISC staff initially meet, and continue to meet, provider training requirements. These reports will also be shared during the quarterly meetings. ii. Methods for Remediation/Fixing Individual Problems Describe the States method for addressing individual problems as they are discovered. Include information regarding responsible parties and GENERAL methods for problem correction. In addition, provide information on the methods used by the state to document these items. i. b.

Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 161 of 302 12/16/2022In addition to the information contained in the OA's Waiver Manual, each participant receives an initial award letter that contains service limits. The service limits are discussed verbally during the annual person centered planning process. The ISC reviews service limits with the participant and guardian, if applicable. The written person centered plan is signed by the participant, or his or her guardian (if one has been appointed), and the ISC. Providers responsible for the plan's implementation must also sign the plan. Maximum for Modifications and Tangible Items There is a $15,000 maximum per individual per five-year period for any combination of Adaptive Equipment/Assistive Technology, Home and Vehicle Modifications, Remote Support - Equipment (which includes consultation, training, installation, equipment costs (lease or purchase), and/or maintenance/repair service agreements), and any monthly monitoring costs for Remote Support. Within the same five-years, there is also a $5,000 maximum per address for permanent home modifications for rented homes. Individuals are informed of their right to request a fair hearing in the event any requests are denied. Individuals are notified of the limits in the OA's Waiver manual. Any combination of Community Day Services and Supported Employment services cannot exceed 1200 hours per year. This limit was established through a review of historical expenditures and is based on hours of operation for day programs established in Illinois Administrative Code, Title 59, Chapter 1, Part 119. Additionally, Supported Employment - Individual Employment Support counts toward the 1,200 hour annual limit for all day programs combined. IL0350.R04.10--The customer will not experience a reduction in service based on the revised service limits and the OA will transition all customers currently using the service in accordance with the transition plan. Behavior Intervention and Treatment services cannot exceed 104 hours per year. These limits were established through a review of historical expenditures.

Furnish the information specified above. Other Type of Limit. The state employs another type of limit. Describe the limit and furnish the information specified above. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 162 of 302 12/16/2022The annual home-based supports budget limits are based on the Illinois Home-Based Support Services Law for Mentally Disabled Adults [405 ILCS 80/2-6 (a) and (b)]. The limits are based on Social Security benefit levels and are adjusted each January when Social Security benefits are adjusted for cost of living increases. These statutory budget limits were set through a public legislative process that included opportunities for public comment by advocates and customers with mental disabilities and their families. The total amount of Waiver services provided in any month is determined by the PCP of the customer within the program maximums. The annual PCP is developed by the ISC and is based on assessments of the customer's needs. Written notices of changes to limits are sent to all customers/guardians (as applicable), Financial Management Service (FMS) entities, and Independent Service Coordination (ISC) agencies by the OA. The monthly home-based support services budget limits are currently set in statute [405 ILCS 80/2-6 (a) and (b)] as: \"(a) three hundred percent of the monthly federal Supplemental Security Income payment for an individual residing alone if the adult with a mental disability is not enrolled in a special education program by a local education agency, or (b) two hundred percent of the monthly Supplemental Security Income payment for an individual residing alone if the adult with a mental disability is enrolled in a special education program by a local education agency\", together with natural supports, general community resources, school-based services (for young adult customers still attending school), and Medicaid State Plan services are sufficient to meet the customer's needs. If the health and welfare of the customer cannot be assured on a long-term basis within the cost limit of home-based supports in combination with other natural supports and community resources, the customer will be considered for other service options within the Waiver, including residential service supports that are not customer-directed and some that are provided 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Customers are notified of the opportunity to request a fairing hearing if enrollment is denied. Appendix C: Participant Services C-5: Home and Community-Based Settings Explain how residential and non-residential settings in this waiver comply with federal HCB Settings requirements at 42 CFR 441.301(c)(4)-(5) and associated CMS guidance. Include: Description of the settings and how they meet federal HCB Settings requirements, at the time of submission and in the future.1. Description of the means by which the state Medicaid agency ascertains that all waiver settings meet federal HCB Setting requirements, at the time of this submission and ongoing.2. Note instructions at Module 1, Attachment #2, HCB Settings Waiver Transition Plan for description of settings that do not meet requirements at the time of submission. Do not duplicate that information here. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 163 of 302 12/16/2022As reflected in the Statewide Transition plan, the OA is in the process of validating all Residential Habilitation (residential) and Community Day Services (non-residential) providers in the waiver through onsite and desk validation processes prior to March 17, 2023. The onsite validation tool includes interviews with customers receiving services and front-line staff and site observations. In addition, all sites are responsible for submitting provider policies that address settings concerns and evidence of compliance with the settings rule. After March 2023, ongoing monitoring will include the incorporation of HCBS settings questions into reviews and surveys done by the Bureau of Quality Management (BQM) and the Bureau of Accreditation, Licensure and Certification (BALC). The person-centered planning process that directs customer's services is being strengthened to include specific questions on HCBS settings compliance based on the customer's perspectives and ongoing experiences receiving services in the community. The Operating Agency (OA) is reviewing and updating Illinois rules, policies, procedures, forms and manuals to also reflect the highest level of commitment to the HCBS settings rule in the Statewide Transition Plan. Ongoing oversight includes: 1) Annually, the OA conducts nursing visits with all residential providers. Nurses make additional onsite visits as needed. 2) Every two years, BALC surveys every site under the waiver, focusing on compliance with the OA rules. Their comprehensive survey tool will include HCBS settings related questions. 3) Annually, BQM pulls a random sampling of people receiving services to review their PCP, services and experiences. Site visits are unannounced and comprehensive in nature. Results are discussed with the provider prior to exit and, depending on the nature of the findings, a plan of correction is required by the OA. Results from the collective site visits are reported on a quarterly basis to the Waiver Quality Management Committee which includes key staff from the MA. Their tools are being updated to include HCBS settings questions. BQM reviews all providers at a minimum of every three years. 4) The OA also contracts with ISC agencies who visit each customer a minimum of four visits a year to develop a PCP, ensure the plan is being implemented and assure the ongoing health, welfare and safety of the waiver customers. Appendix D: Participant-Centered Planning and Service Delivery D-1: Service Plan Development (1 of 8) State Participant-Centered Service Plan Title: Person Centered Plan (PCP) Responsibility for Service Plan Development.

Specify: (a) the supports and information that are made available to the participant (and/or family or legal representative, as appropriate) to direct and be actively engaged in the service plan development process and (b) the participant's authority to determine who is included in the process. c. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 165 of 302 12/16/2022(a) Supports and information that are made available to the customer: Upon enrollment, and annually thereafter, each customer/legal representative is given a statement of rights by the ISC. The statement of rights can be found at: http://www.dhs.state.il.us/onenetlibrary/12/documents/Forms/IL462-1201.pdf. The rights statement is consistent with the final Medicaid Home and Community Based Services rules CMS 2249F and 2296F. The Rights statement includes information on customer's retention of rights, exercising their rights (and restriction of rights if a guardian has been appointed), non-discrimination, selection of providers, humane care and person centered plans, abuse, neglect and exploitation, coercion, restraints, seclusion, confidentiality, communication rights (mail/phone calls/visits), property rights, money and banking rights, labor rights, right to refuse services, medical and dental services, right to participate in their person-centered planning process, voluntary discharge/termination of services, right to file a grievance, right to view their clinical record, and how to report any infringements of their rights, report an Abuse, Neglect or Exploitation allegation or file a complaint/grievance. The customer/legal representative or other individuals from the customer's support network as the customer/family/guardian chooses, and the ISC work together to develop the person-centered plan (PCP). Effective July 1, 2017, the OA became in full compliance with implementation of federal PCP requirements that encompasses a holistic approach. This included revision of the comprehensive assessment to encourage increased customer/authorized representative involvement in development of the PCP. Significant training was provided to ISC staff on the PCP process and all subsequent new ISC staff training has been updated to ensure the OA is in compliance. Rule(s) are being amended to include the PCP process requirements. OA monitoring tools have been revised to ensure PCP requirements are being included. Direct service providers attend the PCP if the customer or his/her legal representative requests their participation. When not attending meetings, the direct service providers indirectly participate in the PCP process through the use of progress notes and other documentation from current providers to inform planning activities. As the date and time is set for the PCP and discussion, the ISC is to make every accommodation possible to satisfy and include all persons identified by the customer/legal representative. It is expected that all conversations between the ISC and the customer/legal representative are customer-focused, constantly reinforcing that planning is a collaborative effort, enabling the waiver customer/legal representative to lead the process to the best of his/her abilities and that the outcome of the process is a PCP that is holistic, owned, is agreed to by the customer/legal representative and is reflective of their needs, preferences, person-centered outcomes, safety, welfare, and health status. The holistic person-centered approach is designed to encompass the comprehensive assessment of the customer's situation and circumstances related to all factors contributing to health, welfare, safety, community integration, quality of life, ability to live independently in the community and the customer's vision for his/her quality of life. ISC staff utilizes a statewide, standardized the Discovery Process for this holistic approach. The use of the discovery process ensures information regarding the customer's goals, needs, and preferences are collected and compiled from various sources such as the ICAP and psychological assessment. The ICAP gathers information on maladaptive behavior index, adaptive behavior index and service score and level. The psychological assessment gathers information on cognitive/intellectual functioning, developmental history, educational background, adaptive skill level, multi-axial diagnosis that includes a primary diagnosis, and recommendations for future service delivery. The assessment collects and compiles information about the customer's strengths, needs, preferences, desired outcomes, health, and risk factors. The discovery process guides an interview with the customer. Topics covered include the customer's self-description, communication needs, relationships, living arrangements, work, abilities, health/medication issues, recreation, and community connections. The discovery process is available upon request from the OA. The PCP must then be based on and address the assessed needs, preferences, and desired outcomes. Alternative services may be considered as responsive if the customer and family cannot specifically have what the customer and family prefer due to limitations identified. ISC staff are trained to discuss potential risks with the customer/legal representative and work together to develop a PCP that will minimize or eliminate risk. All safeguards, supports, education and training necessary to mitigate identified risks are discussed in order to outline additional needed actions to reduce other risks which pose a real or potential threat to the customer's health, safety and/or welfare and will identify who will be responsible for reducing these risks. Once all risks are minimized or eliminated, the customer/legal representative makes decisions to accept any unmitigated risks as part of informed choice. The ISC provides information and support to enable the customer/legal representative to participate in and direct the planning process. The customer/legal representative is informed of the types of services provided under the Waiver, as well as options of all willing and qualified providers. The options discussed and the choices made by the customer/legal Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 166 of 302 12/16/2022representative are documented as part of the planning process. The PCP itself and discussion of the PCP is in plain language and in a manner accessible to the customer/legal representative. The written PCP may be produced in other formats, such as pictures, DVD, etc., to accommodate specific needs of the customer; however, the PCP must exist in a written format as well. The PCP that emerges from this assessment and conversation is one that encompasses all customer needs, desires, outcomes and vision and links the customer with an array of options, not just those programs and services that are components of the waiver. The PCP is the result of this discovery process and it captures the waiver customer's desired outcomes. It identifies supports, both waiver services and non-waiver services, to assist the customer in actualizing these outcomes and desires. The written documentation in the development of the PCP and other assessment forms utilized during the assessment/reassessment processes demonstrate that the waiver customer exercised choice in the decision-making process. Once the PCP is developed by the ISC staff and the customer, it is signed by the customer/legal representative, the ISC staff, and all providers responsible for the PCP's implementation. A copy of the PCP is provided to the customer and all providers listed on the PCP when it is developed and updated. Annually, the customer/legal representative is informed about the process to request updates to the PCP and is informed of his/her right to request a revision to the PCP at any time. (b) The customer's authority to determine who is included in the process. (OA and ISC Processes): The Rights Statement outlines the customer's/legal representative rights to attend any meetings about their care. Person- centered planning practices require that the customer be empowered with the ability to determine who they want involved in the planning process. The ISC staff are trained to discuss this with the customers and ensure that their wishes are upheld during all assessments. 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 441.301(c)(1)(i) outlines the customer's right to lead the person-centered planning process where possible. The customer's representative should have a participatory role, as needed and as defined by the customer, unless State law confers decision-making authority to the legal representative. In addition to being led by the customer receiving services and supports, the person-centered planning process includes the customer's right to choose who will participate in the process. Appendix D: Participant-Centered Planning and Service Delivery D-1: Service Plan Development (4 of 8) Service Plan Development Process. In four pages or less, describe the process that is used to develop the participant- centered service plan, including: (a) who develops the plan, who participates in the process, and the timing of the plan; (b) the types of assessments that are conducted to support the service plan development process, including securing information about participant needs, preferences and goals, and health status; (c) how the participant is informed of the services that are available under the waiver; (d) how the plan development process ensures that the service plan addresses participant goals, needs (including health care needs), and preferences; (e) how waiver and other services are coordinated; (f) how the plan development process provides for the assignment of responsibilities to implement and monitor the plan; and, (g) how and when the plan is updated, including when the participant's needs change. State laws, regulations, and policies cited that affect the service plan development process are available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency (if applicable): d. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 167 of 302 12/16/2022a) Development of PCP, participation in process, and timing of the plan: The State is committed to implementation of a person-centered planning (PCP) process. The ISC staff are trained to include the customer in every aspect of the assessment and PCP development, including providing the customer and his/her representative/guardian with the opportunity to lead the planning process. The ISC staff contacts the customer or authorized representative, usually by phone, prior to the scheduling of the assessment. Assessments are conducted in a setting that is selected by and most convenient for the customer. The ISC staff schedules the visit around the customer and other parties the customer wishes to have included. The ISC staff conducts a face-to-face comprehensive ICAP assessment of the customer. The ICAP gathers information on maladaptive behavior index, adaptive behavior index and service score and level. The psychological assessment gathers information on cognitive/intellectual functioning, developmental history, educational background, adaptive skill level, multi-axial diagnosis that includes a primary diagnosis, and recommendations for future service delivery. The physical assessment gathers information on the individual's physical condition. The assessment allows the customer to express his/her goals, which include those related to service needs, overall life goals or desires and their expectations for care. Goals are holistic and are not restricted to only needs that will be addressed by waiver services. Customers and anyone they wish to include are encouraged to have an active role in the development of the PCP. This includes choosing services and service providers. The ISC agency completes the PCP with the customer, the customer's family and/or legal guardian, and other individuals from the customer's support network as the customer, family or guardian chooses. The face-to-face assessment is conducted in a setting that is selected by and most convenient for the customer. The ISC agency may not provide any direct services in order to avoid a conflict of interest. The PCP is completed prior to initial service implementation and updated at least annually thereafter. The PCP may be updated more frequently should the customer's needs and circumstances change. The time and location of the assessment and PCP meetings are convenient to the customer and authorized representative. To begin the person center planning process, ISC's complete an assessment with the customer using a standard assessment discovery process developed by the Operating Agency (OA) with stakeholder input. The assessment collects and compiles information about the customer's strengths, needs, preferences, desired outcomes, health, and risk factors. The discovery process guides an interview with the customer. Topics covered include the customer's self-description, communication needs, relationships, living arrangements, work (career and income), abilities, health/medication issues, recreation, and community connections. The assessment discovery process is available upon request from the OA. The use of the statewide, standardized assessment discovery process ensures information regarding the customer's goals, needs, and preferences are collected and compiled. The PCP must then be based on and address the assessed needs, preferences, and desired outcomes. Alternative services may be considered as responsive if the customer and family cannot specifically have what the customer and family prefer due to limitations identified. The Discovery process is fluid and should be conducted over a period of time instead of in a single meeting. The completion date of the Discovery Process cannot be more than six (6) months from the date of the upcoming PCP. The Discovery Process should be updated at least annually but can be updated more often if the customer/guardian request changes. The PCP should be developed only after the Discovery process (initial or updated) is complete. Prior to the initiation of services or the expiration of the current PCP, the ISC should complete the PCP based on what was learned during the Discovery process, with the exception of Crisis cases. For customers who are considered to be in Crisis (homeless, abuse, or neglect), the ISC must complete the Crisis Transition Plan and Funding Request form. The ISC then has 30 calendar days after the date the person begins DD Waiver services to conduct the Discovery process and develop the PCP. b) Types of assessments conducted to support the PCP development process, including securing information about customer's needs, preferences and goals, and health status: In (a) above, the Discovery Process is designed to gather information about a customer's preferences, interests, abilities, preferred environments, activities, identified outcomes, risk factors and supports needed in the areas of Home, Important Relationships, Career and Income, Health and Well Being, Communication, Life in the Community, Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 168 of 302 12/16/2022Recreation/Interests/Hobbies, Choice and Decision Making, and Future Plans. The ISC can obtain the information in various ways: conversations (face to face, phone, e-mails), record reviews, assessments/evaluations, provider agency notes and summaries. If the individual is currently enrolled in a DD Waiver service, the ISC agency must obtain information from the current provider agency(s). c) Informing customer of services available under the waiver: Upon enrollment and at least annually thereafter, during the person-centered planning process, the ISC explains to the customer the array of services, regardless of funding sources, which are available to them and for which they are eligible. The array of services also includes the customer's goals that may not be met by a waiver or other formal services. It is the ISC staff's responsibility to explain all service options to the customer, including, but not limited to waiver services. ISC's also explain to the customer the types of services available under the Waiver, as well as all willing and qualified providers of services. The ISC is responsible for informing customers that a listing of all qualified providers by type of provider is available on the OA's website at https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=56772. A written copy of the listing may be made available by the ISC for those customers without internet access upon request. The customers are required to sign the PCP to ensure it adequately represents their goals for care and that the PCP is designed as they want. d) Explanation of how the PCP development process ensures the PCP addresses customer goals, needs (including health care needs), and preferences: The use of the discovery process ensures information regarding the customer's outcomes, needs, and preferences are collected and compiled. The ICAP gathers information on maladaptive behavior index, adaptive behavior index and service score and level. The psychological assessment gathers information on cognitive/intellectual functioning, developmental history, educational background, adaptive skill level, multi-axial diagnosis that includes a primary diagnosis, and recommendations for future service delivery. The assessment collects and compiles information about the customer's strengths, needs, preferences, desired outcomes, health, and risk factors. The discovery process guides an interview with the customer. Topics covered include the customer's self-description, communication needs, relationships, living arrangements, work, abilities, health/medication issues, recreation, and community connections. The assessment discovery process is available upon request from the OA. The PCP must then be based on and address the assessed needs, preferences, and desired outcomes. Alternative services may be considered as responsive if the customer and family cannot specifically have what the customer and family prefer due to limitations identified. e) Explanation of how waiver and other services are coordinated: The ISC is responsible for implementing the PCP and monitoring its on-going implementation and effectiveness. The ISC is charged with coordinating the various services chosen by the customer, including State Plan services for healthcare and medical needs, as well as generic supports. The ISC is responsible for ensuring that no duplication of services exists. The ISC is responsible for ensuring that providers are identified and linked for any services identified the customer may require beyond those authorized in the Waiver, i.e. medical services, non-emergency transportation to medical appointments, dental services, optometric services, etc. The ISC must then monitor that the services are delivered as specified in the PCP. The PCP includes all other services the customer is receiving, regardless of funding source. The PCP is then sent to each waiver provider listed on the PCP so the providers are aware of additional services or assistance in the residential setting. Providers are trained to report any changes in the customer situation to the ISC agency. f) Explanation of how the PCP development process provides for the assignment of responsibilities to implement and monitor the PCP: The OA mandates that upon the initial assessment, annually, upon request, and when changes in services occur, the ISC must provide the Rights statement to the customer. The OA mandates that this brochure not only be given, but also explained and reviewed with the customer. Documentation in the customer's case record must support that this mandate was met. Provider agencies are also mandated to notify the ISC of changes in the customer's status. OA policies, rules, and training outline the responsibilities of the ISC staff. These responsibilities include development and continuous monitoring of the PCP. g) Explanation of how and when the plan is updated, including when the customer's needs change: The PCP is completed prior to initial service implementation and updated at least annually thereafter. The PCP may be Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 169 of 302 12/16/2022updated more frequently should the customer's needs and circumstances change. The time and location of the assessment and PCP meetings are convenient to the customer and authorized representative. Administrative rule 59 IL. Adm. Code 120.160 requires that customers receive a new assessment within 365 days after the last eligibility determination or redetermination. A redetermination shall also be conducted if, before 365 days have elapsed, there is a change in circumstances affecting eligibility to ensure continued eligibility. PCPs are reviewed and adjusted during each assessment. Customers may request a change to the PCP at any time. During assessments, ISC staff educates the customer to call the ISC agency to request a new assessment or to report any changes in their living or medical situation that may affect their services. PCPs can be edited or revised more frequently to meet the customer's changing needs or desires. Whenever there is a significant change in level of service needs or functioning (for example, hospitalization significantly impacting the customer's level of functioning), an assessment edit or revision is to be completed and additional services provided as needed. Appendix D: Participant-Centered Planning and Service Delivery D-1: Service Plan Development (5 of 8) Risk Assessment and Mitigation. Specify how potential risks to the participant are assessed during the service plan development process and how strategies to mitigate risk are incorporated into the service plan, subject to participant needs and preferences. In addition, describe how the service plan development process addresses backup plans and the arrangements that are used for backup. e. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 170 of 302 12/16/2022ISC staff assess for customer needs, evaluate current customer risks and work with the customer/guardian to identify the resources and strategies to mitigate these risks through linkage and delivery of services ultimately to prevent institutionalization and be successful in a community setting. As a part of the person-centered planning process, the ISC assesses the customer's associated risk(s). The ISC provides narrative information (including brief overview of current skills as well as potential and known risks) sufficient to guide a provider. Consideration should be given to both the risks associated with current activities of the customer as well as potential risks which inhibit the customer from pursuing his/her goals and fully participating in integrated settings. All safeguards, supports, education and training necessary to mitigate identified risks should be included. The ISC will identify safeguards that are already in place to minimize identified risks and outline additional needed actions to reduce other risks which pose a real or potential threat to the customer's health, safety and/or welfare and will identify who will be responsible for reducing these risks. The risk domains that must be assessed are: health/medical, safety (home), safety (community), safety (workplace), finances, behavioral and supports. Strategies to mitigate risk must be incorporated into the PCP, including the consequences of choices that may involve risk, documenting the issues concerned and the decisions made. The team will describe, when it is necessary to do so, to the customer and the customer's support network, how the preferences might be limited because of imminent significant danger to the customer's health, safety, or welfare based on the following: - The customer's or guardian's, if one has been appointed, history of decision-making and ability to learn from the natural negative consequences of decision-making; - The possible long and short-term consequences that might result to the customer if the customer makes a poor decision; - The possible long and short-term effects that might result to the customer if the provider limits or prohibits the customer or guardian from making a choice; and - The safeguards available to protect the customer's safety and rights in each context of choices. ISC's address risk as part of the Discovery Process and PCP. Assessments must include the domains listed above and the minimum components described in the Discovery Process. Assessments must be performed at least annually or more frequently if indicated by the needs of the customer. When conducting risk assessments and making recommendations to mitigate risks, assessors should: - Gather information from a variety of sources including the individual customer, guardian, family members, provider's commercially or locally developed risk assessment, paid staff, record review, observation, and assessor direct knowledge of the customer. - Recognize that some domains may not be applicable for all customers. In such cases, the assessor should include a brief explanation of why the domain is not applicable and, therefore, no risks are evident. - Provide narrative information (including brief overview of current skills as well as potential and known risks) sufficient to guide the provider agency(ies). Consideration should be given to both the risks associated with current activities of the customer as well as potential risks which inhibit the customer from pursuing his/her goals and fully participating in integrated settings. Backup plans are developed as part of the PCP development process. If the customer is receiving services from an agency, the agency is required to provide back-up personnel as needed. When the customer is exercising employer authority, the back-up plan is specific to the customer's needs and may include family, other social service agencies, etc. This waiver provides support services to Adults age 18 and older who live at home with other family members or in residential settings. As part of the person-centered planning process, the customer or guardian, if one has been appointed, can make arrangements with multiple providers who can be contacted as needed. A back-up plan is necessary when the absence of the service presents a risk to the health, welfare and/or safety of the customer. The planning team evaluates the need and type of back-up plan taking into consideration natural supports and available waiver services. Customers residing with family members can enter into agreements with providers that can provide services in an emergency situation or provide staff substitutes when regular staff cannot work assigned hours. The back-up plan is specific to the customer's needs and preferences. ISC staff are trained to understand that a sufficient back-up plan is not just to rely on calling 911, but rather one that utilizes other formal social services agencies, as well as family, neighbors and friends, and assistive technology devices. Together, the ISC, customer and anyone else the Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 171 of 302 12/16/2022customer elects to be engaged in the process discuss the availability of both formal and informal options in the event that the authorized services in the PCP are not provided and establish a back-up plan to meet the customer's needs. The ISC assists the customer with posting the back-up plan in a location that is accessible and visible to the customer and other providers that support the customer. The back-up plans include the names and phone numbers of persons and agencies who are available to immediately assist the customer if needed. Appendix D: Participant-Centered Planning and Service Delivery D-1: Service Plan Development (6 of 8) Informed Choice of Providers. Describe how participants are assisted in obtaining information about and selecting from among qualified providers of the waiver services in the service plan. The State requires that freedom of choice be afforded to all customers in the waiver. The Operating Agency (OA) notifies the ISC of all certified contractual providers that provide services in each geographic area. ISC staff meet with the customers to discuss their outcomes and desires and develop the PCP. It is the ISC's role to provide information about the available service providers to each customer and to answer any questions that arise. A list of providers, by provider type, is available on the OA's website located at https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=56772 to assist customers in selecting qualified providers. A written list of providers is available upon request. Customers are supported by the ISC agency under contract with the OA. Once the customer/guardian expresses an interest in or selects the type(s) of services he or she wishes to receive, the ISC informs the customer/guardian of providers offering that type of service in the desired geographic area. ISCs will make referrals to those providers selected by the customer/guardian. These referrals must be documented on the DDPAS-10 form. The ISC ensures linkage with potential providers, and may, at the customer's request, participate in discussions or visits with providers. A copy of the DDPAS-10 form is maintained in the customer's file at the ISC agency's office. On an ongoing basis, and at least annually, the ISC assists customers if they want to change providers. At any time, a customer may ask about other providers offering the types of services they are receiving in their geographic area. The PCP is updated when new providers are selected. The ISC is prohibited from steering a customer toward a provider. The ISC is required to assist in arranging visits to as many providers as a customer chooses. If the customer and guardian require additional time in order to make a decision, the ISC will periodically inquire regarding whether a decision has been made and whether additional information is needed. The customer must decide which provider they choose. f. Appendix D: Participant-Centered Planning and Service Delivery D-1: Service Plan Development (7 of 8) Process for Making Service Plan Subject to the Approval of the Medicaid Agency. Describe the process by which the service plan is made subject to the approval of the Medicaid agency in accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7441.301(b)(1)(i): g. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 172 of 302 12/16/2022The Operating Agency (OA) has day-to-day responsibility for completion and approval of PCPs. The MA, through its Quality Improvement System, reviews PCPs through the process described below. Annually, OA staff review the adequacy of PCPs through a representative sample during on-site quality assurance reviews. The representative sample size is determined using the Raosoft sample size calculator. The sampling methodology is based on a statistically valid approach that uses a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error. The OA completes a review of the representative sample at each ISC annually. Additional reviews are conducted in response to complaints or referrals from other state agencies (OIG, APS). This ongoing administrative activity allows the OA to ensure the ISCs are adhering to the rules, regulations, policies, and procedures. Prior to the review, the OA checks the CIRAS (Critical Incident Reporting and Analysis System) database to review any complaints/concerns for customers served in the ISC's area. Data from the OA reviews of ISC agencies are aggregated by the OA and shared with the MA staff as part of the Waiver Quality Management Committee (QMC) quarterly meetings. The MA reviews a sample of PCPs when monitoring the OA. During these reviews, the PCPs are reviewed for compliance with state and federal regulations. Reports of findings are shared with the OA and recommendations for improvement are made. The OA responds to the MA reports both on an individual and systemic basis. The OA provides follow up on all MA reviews of ISC and provider agencies to ensure corrective actions and remediations have occurred within established timeframes. Discussions on Quality Management review findings and trends are discussed during quarterly meetings between the MA and OA. The MA reviews consist of record reviews, interviews with customers and staff, and direct observations. The QIO determines a review schedule, based on the sample, and performs onsite record reviews to assess compliance with the performance measures (PM) as well as with all applicable state and federal requirements. Reports of findings are shared with the OA by individual PM, along with recommendations for remediation of findings and/or needed systemic improvement(s). Timeliness of remediation is reported back to the MA based on the requirements of each PM, either immediate, 30, 60, 90 days and any remaining outstanding remediation. Information related to onsite record reviews is also shared during quarterly meetings between MA and OA. Appendix D: Participant-Centered Planning and Service Delivery D-1: Service Plan Development (8 of 8) Service Plan Review and Update. The service plan is subject to at least annual periodic review and update to assess the appropriateness and adequacy of the services as participant needs change.

Appendix D: Participant-Centered Planning and Service Delivery D-2: Service Plan Implementation and Monitoring Service Plan Implementation and Monitoring. Specify: (a) the entity (entities) responsible for monitoring the implementation of the service plan and participant health and welfare; (b) the monitoring and follow-up method(s) that are used; and, (c) the frequency with which monitoring is performed. a. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 174 of 302 12/16/2022a) The entity (entities) responsible for monitoring the implementation of the service plan and participant health and welfare: The ISC is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the PCP and the customer's health, safety and welfare. ISC staff and customers develop the PCP together during the initial assessment and at each reassessment the PCP is reviewed and adjusted as needed. Waiver customers are provided with the opportunity to lead the PCP process. The OA administrative rules require that customers receive a new assessment at least annually, when there is significant change, or when the customer requests a new PCP. The assessment addresses all aspects of customer function and supports. The ISC staff identifies services needed and makes the appropriate referrals, as agreed upon by the customer and the ISC staff during the PCP process. Referrals are made for a variety of services including those outside the services offered in the waiver. The ISC is charged with coordinating the various services chosen by the customer, including State Plan services for healthcare and medical needs, as well as generic supports. The ISC is responsible for ensuring providers are identified and linked for any services identified that the customer may require beyond those authorized in the waiver, i.e. medical services, non-emergency transportation to medical appointments, dental services, optometric services, etc. The ISC must then monitor that the services are delivered as specified in the PCP. The minimum frequency of contact for monitoring the PCP's implementation, including direct, in-person contact with the customer, is quarterly. The quarterly monitoring visits are conducted in conjunction with the direct contact for PCP development. During the monitoring visit, the ISC reviews that the services delivered are in accordance with the PCP and that all services authorized in the PCP are being delivered. If the ISC determines the PCP is not meeting the customer's assessed needs, the ISC shall work with the customer, family and guardian, if applicable, to ensure the PCP is modified as necessary. If conflicts arise with providers over PCP issues, the ISC must assist the customer in resolving such conflicts. A resolution protocol, including time frames is posted on the OA's website at https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=115416#a_toc40. The protocol includes a referral to the OA for intervention if issues cannot be resolved locally. The OA will collect all available information and work with the parties to bring about a final resolution to the issue. In the event the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the OA will issue a final and binding decision. Upon enrollment and at least annually thereafter, during the planning process, the ISC explains to the customer what services are available under the Waiver. The ISC is responsible for informing customers that a listing of all qualified providers by type of provider is available on the OAs website located at https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=56772. Upon request, a written copy of the listing will be provided by the ISC for those customers without internet access upon request. b) The monitoring and follow up method(s) that are used: The ISC is responsible for implementing the customer's PCP and monitoring its on-going implementation and effectiveness. ISC staff monitor the provision of services through customer contact, case management services, and satisfaction surveys. The customer, or their guardian, if applicable, or provider agency can request a follow-up by the ISC. When problems are detected, the PCPs can be revised as needed. Separate from the minimum required monitoring visits and the visit(s) for the Discovery and PCP, the ISC should conduct additional monitoring visits (face to face) any time there are significant issues or emergencies with the customer receiving waiver services. The number of monitoring visits should be conducted based on the customer's needs. Additional monitoring visits can occur in the customer's residence or in other locations. The location (i.e. CDS, hospital, home) should be based on the situation or reason for monitoring. In most cases, the ISC should conduct Additional Monitoring visits within 30 calendar days of becoming aware of an issue. The exact timing of the visit should be based on the urgency of the situation and the potential risks to the customer receiving services. For overall program monitoring related to PCP development and implementation, the OA monitors the ISC activity through a representative sample of customers on a continuous, on-going basis. Data is collected and analyzed as specified under the Quality Improvement sections in Appendices D and G on an on-going, continuous basis. Program monitoring includes the development and implementation of the PCP and ensuring that appropriate follow-up was completed as required. Summary reports are shared with the MA and discussed during quarterly Quality Management Committee Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 175 of 302 12/16/2022meetings. When problems are identified, they are documented, and remediation efforts are initiated by the OA. Remediation efforts may include revising PCPs, increased monitoring, technical assistance, plans of correction, voidance of claims, etc. c) The frequency with which the monitoring is performed: ISC staff are required to meet face to face with waiver customers four times a year to ensure services are implemented as described in the PCP. Visits will be no more than four months apart and may be more often as needed. Depending on the services a customer receives, an ISC staff person may contact the customer monthly to ask about satisfaction with their services. Separate from the minimum required monitoring visits and the visit for the Discovery and PCP, the ISC should conduct additional monitoring visits (face to face) any time there are significant issues or emergencies with the customer receiving waiver services. The number of monitoring visits should be conducted based on the customer's needs. Additional monitoring visits can occur in the customer's residence or in other locations. The location (i.e. CDS, hospital, home) should be based on the situation or reason for monitoring. In most cases, the ISC should conduct Additional Monitoring visits within 30 calendar days of becoming aware of an issue. The exact timing of the visit should be based on the urgency of the situation and the potential risks to the customer receiving services. It is the customer's responsibility to notify ISC staff of any changes in status or to request a change to their PCP. Customers can request a change to the PCP at any time. Provider agencies are required to notify ISC staff of changes in the customer's status. Service provision and customer satisfaction are continually monitored at each assessment. During each reassessment visit, ISC staff reviews the PCP to ensure that services are furnished in accordance with the PCP and the services provided by the service provider are meeting the needs of the customer. A new PCP will be created at each reassessment to capture customer's review and agreement with the PCP even if needs or services have not changed. The need for any additional non-waiver-based services is also discussed. ISC staff provides on-going education to the customer about reporting any issues with the provision of services and their service providers. The customers are encouraged to call the ISC agency to assist in resolving issues identified by the customer. ISC staff also reviews the backup plan to ensure it is still in effect and if the backup plan was utilized, it is discussed with the customer to ensure its effectiveness. The PCP, service providers, backup plan or referrals to non-waiver services may be made or modified to ensure the customer's needs are adequately met based on these discussions. Monitoring Safeguards. Select one: Entities and/or individuals that have responsibility to monitor service plan implementation and participant health and welfare may not provide other direct waiver services to the participant. Entities and/or individuals that have responsibility to monitor service plan implementation and participant health and welfare may provide other direct waiver services to the participant. The state has established the following safeguards to ensure that monitoring is conducted in the best interests of the participant. Specify: b. Appendix D: Participant-Centered Planning and Service Delivery Quality Improvement: Service Plan As a distinct component of the States quality improvement strategy, provide information in the following fields to detail the States methods for discovery and remediation. Methods for Discovery: Service Plan Assurance/Sub-assurances The state demonstrates it has designed and implemented an effective system for reviewing the adequacy of service plans for waiver participants.a.

Performance Measures For each performance measure the State will use to assess compliance with the statutory assurance (or sub-assurance), complete the following. Where possible, include numerator/denominator. For each performance measure, provide information on the aggregated data that will enable the State to analyze and assess progress toward the performance measure. In this section provide information on the method by which each source of data is analyzed statistically/deductively or inductively, how themes are identified or conclusions drawn, and how recommendations are formulated, where appropriate.

In no more than two pages, provide an overview of the opportunities for participant direction in the waiver, including: (a) the nature of the opportunities afforded to participants; (b) how participants may take advantage of these opportunities; (c) the entities that support individuals who direct their services and the supports that they provide; and, (d) other relevant information about the waiver's approach to participant direction. a. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 193 of 302 12/16/2022(a) The nature of the opportunities afforded to participants: The waiver affords customers the opportunity to direct their services through employer authority and budget authority. The customer exercises choice and control over the workers who provide services. Customers also exercise decision- making authority and management responsibility for their budgets. Within the overall cost limit, the customers determine the type and amount of services to be purchased and establish rates for Personal Support Workers (PSWs). In 2017, the OA introduced a new service under the waiver called Self-Direction Assistance. A Self-Direction Assistant (SDA) assists the customer (or the customer's family/representative, as appropriate) in arranging for, directing and managing services. Practical skills training is offered to enable families and customers to independently direct and manage waiver services. Examples of skills training include providing information on recruiting and hiring personal support workers, managing workers, and providing information on effective communication and problem-solving. The service/function includes providing information to ensure customers understand the responsibilities involved with directing their services. The extent of the assistance furnished to the customer or family is to be specified in the PCP. Customers are required to use a Fiscal Agent when hiring personal support workers who are not employees of a provider agency. (b) How participants may take advantage of these opportunities: Customers access customer directed services in the same manner they access all waiver services. The process starts with an assessment of eligibility by the ISC. Once a customer is enrolled in the waiver, the ISC agency will assist the customer in meeting their needs through the person-centered planning process. The ISC explains the options the customer has to direct their own services and budget. The ISC also explains the resources available to the customer to assist them in directing their services such as the Self Direction Assistance waiver service. The OA provides a Consumer Handbook for Home Based Services which provides information on customer directed services and assists customers and their families in managing their services. This Handbook is available on the OA's website located at https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=101181#a_toc16 . (c) The entities that support individuals who direct their services and the supports that they provide: Customers are supported to direct their own services by the following entities: -Independent Service Coordination (ISC) Agencies conduct case management services as an administrative activity under the waiver, including PCP development and monitoring; -A fiscal employer agency that provides Financial Management Services (FMS) as an administrative activity under the waiver, including making payments on behalf of the employer, completing required tax and other withholding and documentation; and -An Self-Direction Assistance provider, if selected through an optional direct service under the waiver referred to as Self Direction Assistance (SDA), who assists the customer (or the customer's family or representative, as appropriate) in arranging for, directing and managing services. (d) Other relevant information about the waiver's approach to participant direction: The customer receives information about customer-directed services and supports during the PCP process. Information is presented in both written and verbal formats to ensure the customer and family understand the customer-directed option and can make an informed choice. Information is provided about decision-making budget authority up to the approved level of support. Specific information is provided about the roles and responsibilities of the parent or legal representative and the financial management services. The customer always has the option of receiving agency-based services if they desire. The PCP can be amended at any time to change the provider of service to an agency-based model. The customer's choice of the type of supports is documented as part of the PCP. Service Agreements are completed for each provider selected to work with the waiver customer. If at any time the customer voluntarily decides he or she no longer wants to receive customer-directed services, the PCP will be revised to document the choice of agency-based services. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 194 of 302 12/16/2022A customer may be involuntarily restricted from customer-directed services due to any of the following circumstances: -The MA or the OA determines the customer and/or his or her representative have committed fraud regarding customer- directed program use of funds; -The customer is living with a family member or other individual who has been determined by the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Adult Protective Services (APS) or other authorized entity (e.g., law enforcement) to have abused or neglected the customer or other individuals; -The ISC agency and FMS have determined and documented the customer and/or his or her employer of record are not able to satisfactorily direct their own services, either with or without the assistance of an SDA provider; or -The family/guardian has been found to be acting in his/her own interest rather than in the customer's best interest and there are no other guardians or representatives willing to assume this responsibility. In cases of suspected fraud, abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation, the ISC agency helps customers file a complaint. The form used to file a complaint is the Rights of Individuals Form which can be located on the OA's website at http://www.dhs.state.il.us/onenetlibrary/12/documents/Forms/IL462-1201.pdf . This restriction of customer-directed services by the State is subject to appeal to the MA. The outcome of the appeal process is final. In this event, agency-directed services would be made available and documented in the PCP. The ISC works with the service providers, the SDA provider (if applicable) and the OA as necessary to ensure service continuity and health and welfare during the transition.

Information is available for customers and their families that include guidelines for selecting personal support workers, information on financial management services, rights and responsibilities, and other requirements of the waiver. Information is also available on the OA's website located at https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=32253. The ISC assist's the customer and their family to understand the service options available under the waiver. The information is reviewed with customers at least annually as part of the individual person-centered planning process. Customers are given a handbook developed with input from families and other stakeholders that describes the benefits and potential liabilities of self-directed services. The Consumer Handbook for Home-Based services is found on the OA's website located at https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=101181#a_toc16. General customer responsibilities are referenced in Administrative Rule 89 IL Admin Rule 120.120. Additional customer responsibilities can be found on the OA's website and in the Consumer Handbook.

Describe the nature of this independent advocacy and how participants may access this advocacy: k. Appendix E: Participant Direction of Services E-1: Overview (11 of 13) Voluntary Termination of Participant Direction. Describe how the state accommodates a participant who voluntarily terminates participant direction in order to receive services through an alternate service delivery method, including how the state assures continuity of services and participant health and welfare during the transition from participant direction: A customer or their guardian, if one has been appointed, may choose to voluntarily terminate from customer-direction at any time by contacting the ISC and requesting a change to their person-centered plan (PCP). If the customer exercised employer authority, employees of the customer are typically provided with 30 days advance written notice of the termination, however, this notification is not mandatory. The customer selects a community agency to provide and direct needed waiver services. These changes are discussed among those responsible for person-centered planning. The PCP is updated to reflect the change in the service delivery method, the customer's or guardian's (when applicable) decision to terminate customer-direction, and the selected community agency(ies) that will now be delivering services. The ISC works with service providers and the OA as necessary to ensure service continuity and the health, safety and welfare of the customer during the transition. If the health, safety and welfare of the customer cannot be assured on a long-term basis within the cost limit of customer- directed supports in combination with other natural supports and community resources, the customer will be considered for other service options within the waiver, including other residential habilitation options. The cost limits were established through a review of historical expenditures. The cost limits are set in statute. l. Appendix E: Participant Direction of Services E-1: Overview (12 of 13) Involuntary Termination of Participant Direction. Specify the circumstances when the state will involuntarily terminate the use of participant direction and require the participant to receive provider-managed services instead, including how continuity of services and participant health and welfare is assured during the transition. m. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 204 of 302 12/16/2022A customer may be involuntarily restricted from customer-directed services due to any of the following circumstances: -The MA or the OA determines the customer and/or his or her representative have committed fraud regarding customer- directed program funds; -The customer is living with a family member or other individual who has been determined by the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Adult Protective Services (APS), or other authorized entity (e.g., law enforcement) to have abused or neglected the customer or other individuals; -The ISC agency and FMS have determined and documented the customer and/or his or her employer of record are not able to direct their own services, either with or without the assistance of an SDA provider; or -Family/guardian has been found to be acting in his/her own interest rather than in the customer's best interests and no other guardian or representative is willing to take on this responsibility. In cases of suspected fraud, abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation, the ISC agency can assist the customer in filing a complaint. The form used is the Rights of Individuals Form which can be accessed at: http://www.dhs.state.il.us/onenetlibrary/12/documents/Forms/IL462-1201.pdf. This restriction or termination of customer-directed services by the OA is an appealable decision. The customer may appeal the decision to involuntarily terminate their customer-directed services to the MA. ISC's inform customers of their rights to appeal initially upon enrollment, annually as part of the person-centered planning process and more often as needed. Customers can also access information on their rights to appeal on the OA's website located at http://www.dhs.state.il.us/onenetlibrary/12/documents/Forms/IL462-1202.pdf. Printed information on appeals can also be presented to the customer upon request. The outcome of the appeal process by the MA hearing officer is final. In this event, agency-directed services would be made available to the customer and the customer's decision whether to accept agency-directed services would be documented in the PCP. The ISC works with the service providers, SDA provider (if applicable) and the OA as necessary to ensure service continuity and health, safety and welfare of the customer during the transition from the customer-directed service model to the agency-directed service model. Appendix E: Participant Direction of Services E-1: Overview (13 of 13) Goals for Participant Direction. In the following table, provide the state's goals for each year that the waiver is in effect for the unduplicated number of waiver participants who are expected to elect each applicable participant direction opportunity.

Information about these method(s) must be made publicly available. ii. b. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 207 of 302 12/16/2022Within the overall home-based supports cost limit, the person-centered plan (PCP) specifies the types of and amounts of covered services needed by the customer. For home-based supports, the maximum annual allocation is set by State law. At the time the law was passed, public hearings were held regarding its implementation. The annual allocation is tied to Social Security benefit levels which are indexed to the cost of living (as required by law). The allocation is reviewed annually by the Operating Agency (OA) and the Medicaid Agency (MA). Customers and the general public are made aware of the program budget allocation amounts in a variety of ways. For example, the program Waiver Manual is available at the OA's website and contains information on the budget allocations. A Rate Table is also posted on the OA's website which outlines statewide rates for certain services. In addition, ISC's and SDA providers (if applicable) assist customers in understanding and working within the annual and monthly cost allocations. For some services, statewide rates apply, such as Behavior Intervention and Treatment. For other services, the customer is given the authority to negotiate individual rates. A written Service Agreement is executed between each service provider, the customer or his or her guardian and the SDA provider (if applicable). The Service Agreement defines the terms of the services to be provided including the effective date, the rate of payment, the maximum units of service to be provided each month and the maximum monthly charge. A copy of the Service Authorization for domestic employees is on file with the Financial Management Service (FMS) entity. Bills submitted in excess of the monthly and annual allocations are rejected for payment. This ensures the combination of services received is consistent with the PCP and does not exceed the annual service cost limit. The OA Rate Table is reviewed annually by the OA and MA and it is updated when rate adjustments are implemented, based on State appropriations. Appendix E: Participant Direction of Services E-2: Opportunities for Participant-Direction (4 of 6) Participant - Budget Authority Informing Participant of Budget Amount. Describe how the state informs each participant of the amount of the participant-directed budget and the procedures by which the participant may request an adjustment in the budget amount. Upon being authorized for waiver services, the customer or guardian (when applicable) is informed in writing by the OA and in person by the ISC about the overall cost allocation limit, customer-directed opportunities, and budget authority. Once services have begun, the customer or guardian (when applicable) is notified and kept informed of any adjustments to the overall allocation amount by the OA and ISC. The customer and guardian (when applicable) work with the ISC to establish a budget as a part of the customer's PCP. Adjustments to the budget and/or the PCP can be made throughout the year as needed or requested by the customer. When a customer's needs change, the customer works with the ISC to adjust the PCP and works with the providers to adjust the Implementation Strategies. Service Agreements are developed based on the service needs identified in Implementation Strategies. A Service Agreement form is completed annually to detail the customer's budget. This form may be modified throughout the course of the year as needed. This form is available upon request from the OA. Should any services be reduced or denied, the customer is notified of their right to appeal. iii. b. Appendix E: Participant Direction of Services E-2: Opportunities for Participant-Direction (5 of 6) Participant - Budget Authority Participant Exercise of Budget Flexibility. Select one : iv. b. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 208 of 302 12/16/2022 Modifications to the participant directed budget must be preceded by a change in the service plan. The participant has the authority to modify the services included in the participant directed budget without prior approval. Specify how changes in the participant-directed budget are documented, including updating the service plan. When prior review of changes is required in certain circumstances, describe the circumstances and specify the entity that reviews the proposed change: Customers and guardians, when applicable, may adjust PCPs within the monthly or annual cost allocation without prior review or approval by the OA. Adjustments are made via the use of Service Agreements with providers and by updating the PCP. Changes in services are documented in the PCP and in revised Service Agreements. Changes in Service Agreements where the customer exercises budget authority are shared with the ISC for monitoring purposes. Changes in Service Agreements where the customer exercises employer authority are shared with the Financial Management Service (FMS) entity when services provided by domestic employees change. Prior review by the OA is only required when services are requested which normally require Prior Approval by the OA. Appendix E: Participant Direction of Services E-2: Opportunities for Participant-Direction (6 of 6) Participant - Budget Authority Expenditure Safeguards. Describe the safeguards that have been established for the timely prevention of the premature depletion of the participant-directed budget or to address potential service delivery problems that may be associated with budget underutilization and the entity (or entities) responsible for implementing these safeguards: Per the Developmental Disability and Mental Disability Services Act (405 ILCS 80), adult's home-based supports spending is limited on a monthly basis. The service agreement states the provider, the reimbursement rate, and the amount of services authorized for the month. Customers are encouraged by members of the person-centered planning team and SDA providers (if applicable) to allocate authorized services throughout the entire month to avoid premature depletion of program funds. Edits in the electronic billing system prevent over expenditures on monthly spending. The OA's electronic transfer alerts the FMS of any units of service above the authorized services. Any provider billings that exceed the monthly allotment of services are rejected and remain unpaid. The ISC is responsible for monitoring PCP implementation and customer health, safety and welfare, identify and address issues of concern, including the timely prevention of the premature depletion of the customer-directed budget or potential service delivery problems. The minimum frequency of contact for monitoring the PCP's implementation, including direct, in-person contact with the customer, is at least four times a year. This four times a year monitoring visit includes the direct contact for PCP development. The ISC (on a mid-year basis) reviews that the PCP is being fully implemented. Also, the OA, on a statistically valid sample basis, reviews that the PCP is being fully implemented. v. b. Appendix F: Participant Rights Appendix F-1: Opportunity to Request a Fair Hearing The state provides an opportunity to request a Fair Hearing under 42 CFR Part 431, Subpart E to individuals: (a) who are not given the choice of home and community-based services as an alternative to the institutional care specified in Item 1-F of the request; (b) are denied the service(s) of their choice or the provider(s) of their choice; or, (c) whose services are denied, suspended, reduced or terminated. The state provides notice of action as required in 42 CFR \u00a7431.210.Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 209 of 302 12/16/2022Procedures for Offering Opportunity to Request a Fair Hearing. Describe how the individual (or his/her legal representative) is informed of the opportunity to request a fair hearing under 42 CFR Part 431, Subpart E. Specify the notice(s) that are used to offer individuals the opportunity to request a Fair Hearing. State laws, regulations, policies and notices referenced in the description are available to CMS upon request through the operating or Medicaid agency. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 210 of 302 12/16/2022Notification Any customer who applies for or receives waiver services has the right to appeal adverse decisions and actions. ISC entities are responsible for informing customers of their right to appeal. The customer is informed by the ISC of his/her right to appeal adverse actions taken regarding services or eligibility. In addition, the customer is informed of their rights at the time of the initial home visit and upon every reassessment. The right to appeal is also covered on the OA's website located at https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=101181#a_toc8. Customer appeal rights are also outlined in 59 Ill. Admin. Code 120.110. The OA has developed a standard form, Notice of Individual's Right to Appeal Medicaid Waiver Determinations (IL462-1202, in English and Spanish) for customers to use when filing an appeal. This form is located on the OA's website at http://www.dhs.state.il.us/onenetlibrary/12/documents/Forms/IL462-1202.pdf. The ISC, OA or provider agency, whichever entity took the adverse decision or action, will notify the customer and/or guardian in writing of the action taken and the process to appeal. The customer and/or guardian will be provided with a notice that includes the action, whether or not services will continue and a copy of the Notice of Individual's Right to Appeal Medicaid Waiver Determinations (IL462-1202). This written notice serves as the notice of the right to appeal for the customer and begins the 10-business day timeframe for the customer to provide written notification to the ISC of their intent to appeal. The customer's services will remain in place at the former levels pending the final decision of the appeal. OA staff and MA staff are responsible for written notification when there is an adverse decision in the fair hearing process. The OA staff provide written notification during the informal review process. The MA staff provide written notification during the administrative hearing process. Appeal Process Customers and guardians, if appointed, are informed by the ISC of appeal rights when services are presented including the choice of HCBS as an alternative to institutional care, denying the service or the providers(s) of their choice and also upon notice of service denial, suspension, termination or reduction. Information about appeal rights is also available at any time upon request. 89 Ill. Admin. Code 104 and 59 Ill. Admin Code 120.110 describes the fair hearing request procedures in use for the Adult Developmental Disability Waiver. Copies of notices are maintained in the customer's record by the ISC. If customers receive notice of adverse action, they have ten working days to file written notification to the ISC of their intent to appeal. The ISC must submit the appeal packet to the OA within 60 calendar days of the date the customer receives the notice of adverse decision or action. The request for an appeal allows the customer's services to remain in place at the former levels until a final hearing decision is reached or until the appeal is withdrawn. Once the appeal is filed, the OA has 30 working days to conduct an informal review of the appealed action. The informal review process can reverse, modify, or leave the action unchanged. At the conclusion of the informal review, the customer, and the service provider, if applicable, is notified in writing of the OA's decision within ten working days after the informal review. The written notice includes clear statements of the action to be taken, the reason for the action, supporting policy references, and a complete statement of the customer's right to appeal the decision to the MA. If the customer agrees with the OA's informal review decision, the customer may withdraw their appeal. If the customer does not agree with the OA's decision through the informal review, the customer has ten working days to appeal the informal review decision and request a formal appeal hearing with the MA for final administrative action. The MA's fair hearings process is the same for all customers. The MA is the final level of Appeal. An MA Hearing Officer conducts the formal hearing. At the hearing, the customer can present evidence on his/her behalf to dispute the adverse action. The customer may choose to be represented by legal counsel or another person the customer appoints. The decision of the formal hearing is made by the Medicaid Director and is final and can only be appealed through the circuit court system. The MA appoints an impartial hearing officer to conduct the hearing at the MA or OA office nearest to the customer's home unless all parties agree to an alternate location. All parties may participate by phone or video conference. The Medicaid hearing officer conducts the formal appeal, drafts the decision and sends it to the MA Hearing Supervisor for final review and sign-off by the Medicaid Director. Once a final decision is released by the MA, it is reviewable only through the Circuit Courts of the State of Illinois. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 211 of 302 12/16/2022 The MA rule (89 Ill. Adm. Code 104.70) provides that an appeal decision shall be given within 60 days of the date it was filed unless additional time is required, which may include postponement or continuance of a hearing for good cause as provided in 89 Ill. Adm. Code 104.45. The appeal process follows federally mandated rules that require all appeals to be treated equally and ensure due process is given for each appellant. Training for the Medicaid hearing officers is conducted in several ways: by group training, one-on-one mentoring, and shadowing of experienced Medicaid hearing officers. Training encompasses the Medicaid Hearing Officer Manual, and the Medicaid waiver administrative codes and citations. All current HFS Medicaid Hearing Officers have experience in HFS programs, either Medical Programs or Child Support. Monitoring of the hearing process and final decisions occurs in several ways: - The scheduling Medicaid Hearing Officer Supervisor creates a monthly report with the disposition of all cases to assure that hearings are being scheduled and moving through the process. - Decisions go through three levels of HFS review: o the Medicaid Hearing Officer drafts the case o the Medicaid Hearing Supervisor reviews 100% of the cases o the Medicaid Director makes the final decision on every case - Quality Controls consist of reviewing cases for consistency in the application of the Medicaid laws and the use of sound legal reasoning. Trends and patterns are also considered as part of the quality oversight process.

Operational Responsibility. Specify the state agency that is responsible for the operation of the grievance/complaint system: b. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 212 of 302 12/16/2022The OA is responsible for the grievance/complaint system. The ISC entities, under contract with the OA, are responsible for hearing and resolving issues that arise at the local providers. The OA is responsible for providing technical assistance when the ISC entities cannot successfully resolve local issues. The OA maintains a database of complaints referred by ISCs or made directly by customers. Reports from the database are shared monthly by the OA with the MA. The data is analyzed and evaluated for trends on a quarterly and annual basis. As individual problems and trends are identified, proactive remediation is initiated. The State establishes remediation plans by identifying the responsibilities of the MA and OA and identifying timeframes for completion. The Waiver Quality Management Committee collectively tracks the remediation activity. The FMS entity/entities maintains a complaint log regarding issues concerning the payment of domestic employees. Summary data from the log is reported to and reviewed by the OA on a quarterly basis. This information is shared with and reviewed by the Quality Management Committee on an annual basis. Remediation is initiated and tracked as necessary. The State establishes remediation plans by identifying the responsibilities of the MA and OA and identifying timeframes for completion. Description of System. Describe the grievance/complaint system, including: (a) the types of grievances/complaints that participants may register; (b) the process and timelines for addressing grievances/complaints; and, (c) the mechanisms that are used to resolve grievances/complaints. State laws, regulations, and policies referenced in the description are available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency (if applicable). c. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 213 of 302 12/16/2022(a) the types of grievances/complaints that participants may register Upon enrollment and at each reassessment thereafter, customers and guardians are informed by the ISC of the OA's informal grievance process for making complaints, and that filing a grievance or making a complaint is not a prerequisite or substitute for a fair hearing. The OA's procedures do not require customers to file an informal grievance prior to exercising their right to appeal. Customers who are dissatisfied with some aspect of service provision may contact the ISC to file grievances or complaints. The ISCs use the Rights of the Individuals form (IL462-1201), found here https://www.dhs.state.il.us/onenetlibrary/12/documents/Forms/IL462-1201.pdf, to document the notification. Options for filing complaints are also posted on the OA's website located at https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=52240. The type of complaints can include anything of concern to the customer or guardian, e.g., dissatisfaction with the customer's PCP, failure to implement the customer's PCP, quality of services or supports, risk of losing services, etc. In addition, customers can identify and report issues that are program-wide and do not specifically apply to their individual services. (b) the process and timelines for addressing grievances/complaints Customers have 30 days to file a complaint/grievance after the incident occurs. When a complaint is received, the OA will make an initial response to the customer making the complaint within two business days to let them know the complaint was received and is being reviewed. The OA has an overall goal to resolve grievances within 30 days. Timeliness is tracked and monitored by the OA and reported and discussed with the MA at the quarterly Waiver Quality Management meetings. Upon receipt of a complaint, the OA records the complaint in a database that documents the person making the complaint; the type of complaint; the substance of the complaint; the names of any customers, providers, and/or ISC's involved; the person(s) at the OA assigned to review and address the complaint; action steps taken; final resolution; and dates of intake, action steps, and resolution. (c) the mechanisms that are used to resolve grievances/complaints. State laws, regulations, and policies referenced in the description are available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency An OA staff person is assigned to each complaint. The assigned staff person confirms and/or collects information from the ISC, provider(s), and any other parties involved. He or she then takes appropriate action steps depending upon the complaint. Action steps include follow up with the individual submitting the grievance/complaint, waiver customer, provider agency, ISC, etc. to determine cause of the grievance and work with these entities to find a suitable resolution for all parties. Final resolution is recorded in the log. Reports are produced twice monthly for managers within the OA to ensure open complaints are being addressed on a timely basis. The data is analyzed and evaluated for trends on a quarterly and annual basis. The summary reports are shared with the MA at the quarterly Waiver Quality Management meetings. As individual problems and trends are identified, proactive remediation is initiated. Based on the data, the OA and MA may develop system improvement plans by identifying the responsibilities of the MA and OA and identifying time frames for completion. The Waiver Quality Management Committee (QMC) tracks all system improvement plans until completion. Appendix G: Participant Safeguards Appendix G-1: Response to Critical Events or Incidents Critical Event or Incident Reporting and Management Process.

Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 214 of 302 12/16/2022 State Critical Event or Incident Reporting Requirements. Specify the types of critical events or incidents (including alleged abuse, neglect and exploitation) that the state requires to be reported for review and follow-up action by an appropriate authority, the individuals and/or entities that are required to report such events and incidents and the timelines for reporting. State laws, regulations, and policies that are referenced are available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency (if applicable). b. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 215 of 302 12/16/2022The OA has two network-wide reporting structures for tracking and following-up on critical incidents. The first structure covers, all alleged instances of abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or exploitation (ANE) that are reported to either the State's Office of Inspector General (OIG) or the State's Adult Protective Services (APS) entity depending on which setting the customer receives services. The second reporting structure is the Critical Incident Reporting and Analysis System (CIRAS). The State requires the reporting of alleged abuse, neglect, exploitation, and unanticipated deaths of customers receiving services in settings that are licensed or certified by the Bureau of Accreditation, Licensure, and Certification (BALC), or funded by the OA. These allegations are reported to the OIG for intake and investigation. Reports can be made by anyone having contact with the customer or otherwise aware of the allegations. Employees within Independent Service Coordination (ISC) agencies and providers are mandated to report allegations. Reports are made via phone calls to the OIG hotline: (800) 368-1463. For customers receiving supports in settings licensed or certified by BALC, the OA uses a set of definitions for critical incidents covering abuse, neglect, self-neglect or exploitation and other events that can place an individual at risk which are found at 59 Ill. Adm. Code 50, Section 50.10. -Abuse. See definitions for physical abuse, sexual abuse, mental abuse and financial exploitation. -Egregious neglect. A finding of neglect as determined by the Inspector General that represents a gross failure to adequately provide for, or a callous indifference to, the health, safety or medical needs of a customer and results in an customer's death or other serious deterioration of an customer's physical condition or mental condition. -Financial exploitation. Taking unjust advantage of a customer's assets, property or financial resources through deception, intimidation or conversion for the employee's, facility's or agency's own advantage or benefit. -Mental abuse. The use of demeaning, intimidating or threatening words, signs, gestures or other actions by an employee about a customer and in the presence of a customer or customers that results in emotional distress or maladaptive behavior, or could have resulted in emotional distress or maladaptive behavior, for any customer present. -Neglect. An employee's, agency's or facility's failure to provide adequate medical care, personal care or maintenance, and that, as a consequence, causes a customer pain, injury or emotional distress, results in either a customer's maladaptive behavior or the deterioration of a customer's physical condition or mental condition, or places a customer's health or safety at substantial risk of possible injury, harm or death. -Physical abuse. An employee's non-accidental and inappropriate contact with a customer that causes bodily harm. \"Physical abuse\" includes actions that cause bodily harm as a result of an employee/facility/agency directing a customer or person to physically abuse another customer. -Sexual abuse. Any sexual contact or intimate physical contact between an employee and a customer, including an employee's coercion or encouragement of a customer to engage in sexual behavior that results in sexual contact, intimate physical contact, sexual behavior, or intimate physical behavior. Sexual abuse also includes: o an employee's actions that result in the sending or showing of sexually explicit images to a customer via computer, cellular phone, electronic mail, portable electronic device, or other media, with or without contact with the customer; or o an employee's posting of sexually explicit images of a customer online or elsewhere, whether or not there is contact with the customer. Sexual abuse does not include allowing customers to, of their volition, view movies or images of a sexual nature or read text containing sexual content unless the customer's guardian prohibits the viewing of those movies or images or reading of that material. See 89 Ill. Adm. Code 270 at http://ilga.gov/commission/jcar/admincode/089/08900270sections.html. Under this regulation, \"If any mandated reporter has reason to believe that an eligible adult, who because of disability or other condition or impairment is unable to seek assistance for himself or herself, has, within the previous 12 months, been subjected to abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation, the mandated reporter, shall, within 24 hours after developing such belief, report this suspicion...\" [Quoted from enabling statute: 320 ILCS 20/4(a-5).] Under this regulation, unanticipated deaths must be reported within 24 hours from the time the death was first discovered, or the reporter was informed of the unanticipated death or within four hours if abuse or neglect is suspected. Required reporters must report allegations of abuse, neglect, or exploitation within four hours of initial discovery by the required reporter. The State also requires the reporting of alleged abuse, neglect, and exploitation of customers receiving supports in their own homes. These reports are sent to the State's Adult Protective Services (APS) unit for review and actions necessary to ensure the health and safety of the alleged victim. Reports can be made by anyone having contact with the customer or otherwise aware of the allegations. Employees within ISC agencies and providers are mandated reporters. The Adult Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 216 of 302 12/16/2022Protective Services Act (320 ILCS 20/1 et seq.) authorized the Illinois Department on Aging (IDoA) to administer the Adult Protective Services (APS) Program to respond to reports of community-based abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or exploitation. The empowered APS Program provides for intake, investigation, and follow-up of reported incidents. The APS Program is coordinated through 39 agencies located throughout the state and designated by the Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) and the Illinois Department on Aging. APS agencies conduct investigations and work with adults age 60 or older and adults age 18-59 with disabilities (including those covered by the waiver), in resolving the abuse, neglect, self- neglect, or financial exploitation. Persons can report suspected abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or exploitation by utilizing the APS Hotline number at 1-866-800-1409, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They may also call the Senior Helpline at 1-800-252-8966 (voice) or 888-206-1327 (TTY). Definitions of ANE for customers receiving supports in their own homes. For these customers, the OA uses a set of definitions for critical incidents covering abuse, neglect, self-neglect or exploitation and other events that can place a customer at risk which are found at 89 Ill. Adm. Code 270, Section 270.210. -Abuse means causing any physical, mental, or sexual injury to an eligible adult, including exploitation of such adult's financial resources [320 ILCS 20/2(a)]. -Neglect means another individual's failure to provide an eligible adult with or willful withholding from an eligible adult the necessities of life including, but not limited to, food, clothing, shelter or health care. This definition does not create any new affirmative duty to provide support to eligible adults. Nothing in the Act shall be construed to mean that an eligible adult is a victim of neglect because of health care services provided or not provided by licensed health care professionals [320 ILCS 20/2(g)]. -Physical abuse means the causing of physical pain or injury to an eligible adult. -Sexual exploitation means any sexual activity with an eligible adult who is unable to understand, unwilling to consent, threatened, or physically forced to engage in such sexual activity. -Emotional abuse means verbal assaults, threats of maltreatment, harassment, or intimidation. -Confinement means restraining or isolating an individual for other than bona fide medical reasons. -Passive neglect means the failure by a caregiver to provide an eligible adult with the necessities of life including, but not limited to, food, clothing, shelter, or medical care, because of failure to understand the eligible adult's needs, lack of awareness of services to help meet needs, or a lack of capacity to care for the eligible adult. -Willful deprivation means the deliberate denial to an eligible adult of required medication, medical care, shelter, food, therapeutic devices, or other physical assistance, thereby exposing that person to the risk of physical, mental, or emotional harm. Willful deprivation shall not include the discontinuation of medical care or treatment when the eligible adult has expressed a desire to forego such medical care or treatment. -Financial exploitation means the use of an eligible adult's resources by another to the disadvantage of that adult or the profit or advantage of a person other than that adult [320 ILCS 20/2(f-1)]. The Illinois Adult Protective Services Act (320 ILCS 20/1) requires personnel of the Area Agencies on Aging, the OA, the ISCs, and provider agencies to be mandated reporters in cases where the adult is unable to self-report. The APS policy specifically states that if a direct service worker witnesses or identifies a case of possible abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or financial exploitation, they are mandated to personally report the allegations to the designated APS agency or to the OA's Hotline number within 24 hours. State regulations covering APS mandated reporters and timelines for reporting are contained in 89 Illinois Administrative Code (ILAC), Part 270.30. Follow-up Actions by the APS can be found at: 89 ILAC, Section 270.240 Intake of ANE or Self-Neglect Reports. APS rules may be accessed at the IDoA's website at: https://www2.illinois.gov/aging/AboutUs/Pages/rules-main.aspx In addition, the state requires the reporting of other critical incidents to the OA through its automated Critical Incident Reporting and Analysis System (CIRAS). The other critical incidents include deaths otherwise not reportable to OIG or APS, known injuries, law enforcement involvement, medical emergencies, missing customers, peer-to-peer acts of aggression, unauthorized restraint, injuries of unknown origin, and unscheduled hospitalizations. Providers must report such incidents within two working days of discovery or being informed of the incident. Since the incidents reported through CIRAS do not involve allegations of abuse, neglect, or exploitation, providers are given more time to compile and report information ensuring it is complete and accurate for trend analysis. The manual for the CIRAS system is available from the OA's website located at https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=97101. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 217 of 302 12/16/2022 Upon entry of an incident into CIRAS, the electronic system automatically notifies the ISC agency of the report. ISCs use this information to effectively monitor the customer's well-being and ensure any needed actions are taken. The ISC staff review the critical incidents in a timely manner, actively attempt to mitigate risk(s) associated with their occurrence while implementing risk-mitigation strategies aimed at reducing future critical incidents. OA staff also receives notification upon entry of reports of missing person and law enforcement involvement. All types of reports are summarized and analyzed on a monthly basis by OA staff. The summary and analytical reports are shared with the MA on a quarterly basis at the Waiver Quality Management meetings. ISCs must comply with the 59 Ill. Adm. Code Part 50, Elder Abuse and Neglect Act, and the Critical Incident reporting requirements of the OA. ISCs must comply with all health, safety, and welfare monitoring and reporting required by State or federal statute or regulation, or that is a condition for a HCBS Waiver, including the following: critical-incident reporting regarding abuse, neglect, self-neglect, and exploitation; critical-incident reporting regarding any incident that has the potential to place a customer, or a customer's services, at risk, but which does not rise to the level of abuse, neglect, or exploitation; and performance measures relating to the areas of health, safety, and welfare and required for operating and maintaining an HCBS Waiver. Examples of critical events may include but are not limited to: 911 Call Death Unknown Injury Law Enforcement Medical Emergency Missing Individual Peer to Peer Acts Peer to Staff Unauthorized Restraint Unknown Injury Unscheduled Hospitalization For these types of incidents, if there is a perceived immediate threat to a customer's life or safety, the ISC and/or provider will follow emergency procedures which may include calling 911. All incidents will be entered into CIRAS and reported to the OA. Based on the situation, the customer's age or placement reports will also be made to the appropriate State of Illinois investigative agencies. Participant Training and Education. Describe how training and/or information is provided to participants (and/or families or legal representatives, as appropriate) concerning protections from abuse, neglect, and exploitation, including how participants (and/or families or legal representatives, as appropriate) can notify appropriate authorities or entities when the participant may have experienced abuse, neglect or exploitation. c. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 218 of 302 12/16/2022Customers and/or their guardian (if one has been appointed) are informed by the ISC about protections from abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation (ANE). The information provided includes the process for reporting allegations to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) for those customers receiving services in settings that are licensed or certified by the Bureau of Accreditation, Licensure, and Certification (BALC) or funded by the OA, and to the Adult Protective Services (APS) for those customers receiving services while residing in their own homes. Customers and guardians are informed that anyone who suspects abuse, neglect or financial exploitation may report an allegation. Information is provided in the Rights of the Individual form (IL462-1201), located at https://www.dhs.state.il.us/onenetlibrary/12/documents/Forms/IL462-1201.pdf, and is shared with the Customer and guardian (if one has been appointed) upon enrollment and upon every reassessment thereafter. ISC staff discuss the importance of reporting allegations of abuse, neglect and financial exploitation and other critical incidents. Information on the State's hotline is available on multiple websites and is also listed in the Waiver Manual, located at https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=45227. Instructions about reporting allegations, including the hotline, are also available on the OA website, located at https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=52240. The State addressed the need for public awareness through campaigns, such as \"Break the Silence\" and \"Engage to Change\". These public awareness campaigns, facilitated through the Adult Protective Services at Illinois Department on Aging, provide information and training about how to prevent, recognize, and report situations involving abuse, neglect, self-neglect, and exploitation of all adults. The State developed a brochure for all HCBS waiver customers and family members/guardians that explains how to report ANE. The OA monitors and ensures customers and guardians have received appropriate information about reporting allegations of abuse, neglect and financial exploitation. ISC staff receive training on critical incident reporting and follow-up. Direct care staff are provided training through their employer and new state provider standards have enhanced requirements for staff training about abuse, neglect, self- neglect, exploitation, and mandated reporting requirements. Responsibility for Review of and Response to Critical Events or Incidents. Specify the entity (or entities) that receives reports of critical events or incidents specified in item G-1-a, the methods that are employed to evaluate such reports, and the processes and time-frames for responding to critical events or incidents, including conducting investigations. d. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 219 of 302 12/16/2022Allegations of Abuse, Neglect, or Exploitation in Settings Licensed or Certified by the Bureau of Accreditation, Licensure, and Certification (BALC) or funded by the OA. The State's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which is a semi-independent entity that reports to both the Governor and the Secretary of IDHS, has statutory authority to receive and investigate reports of alleged abuse, neglect and exploitation of adults with developmental disabilities served in settings licensed or certified by BALC or funded by the OA. OIG staff receiving the report of the allegation are responsible for assessing, based on the information received at intake, whether the allegation could constitute abuse, neglect or exploitation and whether OIG has the authority to investigate. OIG must make these assessments within one day after receiving the report. Any allegations or investigations of reports of abuse, neglect and exploitation shall remain confidential until a final report is completed. The identity of any person as a complainant shall remain confidential in accordance with the State's Freedom of Information Act [5 ILCS 140] or unless identification is authorized by the complainant. Information concerning tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and diagnosis and treatment for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) shall be disclosed to OIG by community agencies only in accordance with the AIDS Confidentiality Act [410 ILCS 305]. All personal health related information contained in OIG investigative reports shall remain confidential in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) (P.L. 104-191) (45 CFR 160, 162 and 164). All investigations shall be conducted in a manner that respects the dignity and human rights of all persons involved. After determining the finding in all cases, the OIG must notify the following parties of the finding: -the complainant, -the customer who was allegedly abused, neglected or exploited or his or her legal guardian (if applicable); -the person alleged to have committed the offense; and -the employer of the person alleged to have committed the offense (i.e., the qualified service provider). Within 10 days of completion, copies of investigative reports are shared with the State's Human Rights Authority, the protection and advocacy organization (Equip for Equality), the OA, and BALC. If an investigation results in a substantiated finding of physical abuse, sexual abuse, egregious neglect or financial exploitation, it shall result in the accused employee's identity and the OIG finding being reported to the Health Care Worker Registry. Allegations of Abuse, Neglect, or Exploitation in Settings Not Licensed or Certified by BALC. The State's Adult Protective Services (APS) agency operated at the Illinois Department on Aging (IDoA) has statutory authority to receive and investigate all allegations of abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation of adults aged 18 and over in private homes. APS investigates allegations, assesses the customer's situation and circumstances, takes emergency actions as needed, and works with local law enforcement authorities when necessary. The State has established classifications for critical incidents (i.e., Priority I, II, III,) depending upon the nature and urgency of the event. This classification determines whether an investigation needs to occur and the timeframe for conducting that investigation. The definitions and time frames of these levels are located at 89 ILAC Section 270.240 located at http://ilga.gov/commission/jcar/admincode/089/089002700C02400R.html. Depending on the nature and seriousness of the allegations, and the priority level given to the report, a trained APS caseworker makes a face-to-face contact with the alleged victim with the following time frames: -Priority one reports are reports of abuse or neglect in which the alleged victim is reported as being in serious physical harm or in immediate danger of death or serious physical harm. Priority one reports include, but are not limited to, alleged abuse resulting in fractures, head injuries, internal injuries, or burns; threats of serious injury or death; lack of basic physical necessities severe enough to result in freezing, serious heat stress or starvation; need for immediate, significant medical attention; and alleged sexual abuse that has occurred in the last 72 hours. The APS caseworker must make a face-to-face visit within 24 hours of receipt of the report. -Priority two reports are reports of abuse, neglect or exploitation in which the alleged victim is reported as being abused, neglected or exploited and the report taker has reason to believe that the health and safety consequences to the alleged Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 220 of 302 12/16/2022victim are less serious than priority one reports. Priority two reports include, but are not limited to, physical abuse involving scratches or bruises; inadequate attention to physical needs such as insufficient food or medicine; unreasonable confinement; and probability of liquidation or depletion of an alleged victim's income and assets. The APS caseworker must make a face-to-face visit within 72 hours of receipt of the report. -Priority three reports are reports of abuse, neglect or exploitation in which the alleged victim is reported as being emotionally abused or the alleged victim's financial resources are being misused or withheld and the report taker has reason to believe that there is no immediate or serious threat of harm to the alleged victim. The APS caseworker must make a face-to-face visit within 7 calendar days of receipt of the report. The State requires that all reports are investigated with initial contact based on assigned priority. APS investigates all reports and with consent, will put interventions in place to address the health, safety, and welfare of the alleged victim. The State's Office of Adult Protective Services' regulations also require certain response timelines by the ANE agency. A trained Adult Protective Services case worker, trained by the Illinois Department on Aging, will respond within the specified time period depending on the severity of the case and begin the investigation if consent is given. As an adult, a competent person may exercise their consent authority to accept or refuse an assessment and may accept or refuse all services and interventions offered during the review and resolution of the allegation. This is called the customer's right to self-determination, upon which the Adult Protective Services program is based. No decisions are made about a competent adult without that adult's involvement and consent. The customer's consent would be noted in the record. An eligible adult reported to be abused, neglected, financially exploited, or self-neglected, or such adult's authorized guardian, unless the guardian is the abuser, or the alleged abuser shall have records provided to them upon request. Depending on the nature of the incident of abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation, the customer and /or family members, and providers may be notified. The State has set criteria regarding when notifications are mandatory. Completed reviews are shared with the OA within 5 days. The OA then provides copies to the applicable ISC agency within 5 days of receipt of the completed review. The ISC is responsible to ensure the health and welfare of the customer and may recommend additional services and provide monitoring, to protect the customer. Critical incidents may also result in a review of customer needs to determine whether a change in the service or level of service is needed. The MA and the OA work with Adult Protective Services (APS) and share information in order to improve remediation activities with providers serving customers. The OA and MA staff use the incident information to complete statewide summary and trend analyses to identify, address, and prevent potential abuse, neglect, and exploitation, as well as otherwise seek strategies to enhance the service delivery system. Beyond allegations of abuse, neglect, and or exploitation addressed above, the OA requires its providers to report directly to the OA other types of critical incidents, including deaths otherwise not reportable to OIG or APS, known injuries, law enforcement involvement, medical emergencies, missing customers, peer-to-peer acts of aggression, unauthorized restraint, injuries of unknown origin, and unscheduled hospitalizations. These reports do not include allegations of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. These incidents are reported electronically to the OA. All reports are accepted. Upon receipt of a report, the ISC agency is automatically notified of the incident. In the case of law enforcement involvement, missing customers, or unscheduled hospitalizations, the ISC agency will work with the reporting provider to take necessary steps to ensure the customer's safety. All CIRAS submissions require a follow-up entry by the ISC within 10 working days of the initial report. The OA staff use the incident information to complete statewide summary and trend analyses to identify, address, and prevent potential abuse, neglect, and exploitation, as well as otherwise seek strategies to enhance the service delivery system. Responsibility for Oversight of Critical Incidents and Events. Identify the state agency (or agencies) responsible for overseeing the reporting of and response to critical incidents or events that affect waiver participants, how this oversight is conducted, and how frequently. e. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 221 of 302 12/16/2022The OA oversees the reporting and response of all critical incidents and complaints. The OA uses the Critical Incident Reporting and Analysis System (CIRAS) to analyze trends and to ensure that follow up has occurred. For some individual circumstances, the OA may be working with APS or the ISC to resolve the issue. The State's Adult Protective Services (APS) maintains a tracking system of ANE investigations and statistical reports are generated annually. Data is used to inform the OA and MA to monitor system performance and remediate problems. If an Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigation substantiates abuse, neglect or financial exploitation, meaning a preponderance of the evidence supports that the abuse or neglect did occur, the provider is required to submit a Written Response within 30 days for approval by the OA. The Written Response must indicate what actions will be taken to address the issues identified. If a finding of physical abuse, sexual abuse or egregious neglect is substantiated, the perpetrator's name is placed on the Illinois Department of Public Health, Health Care Worker Registry. The provider is required to inform the victim and the guardian whether the reported allegation was substantiated, unsubstantiated or unfounded. If the provider is unable to reach the customer or guardian by phone, a letter of notification must be sent within 24 hours of receiving notice of the finding. The OA receives allegations of abuse, neglect and financial exploitation from OIG as reported by complainants to the OIG telephone hotline. These reports are received generally within 2 business days of the allegation being reported. Although OIG investigates, the OA reviews each allegation to determine whether other/additional action is warranted prior to completion of the OIG investigation. If a finding of physical abuse, sexual abuse or egregious neglect is substantiated following an Adult Protective Services (APS) investigation, the perpetrator's name may be placed on the Adult Protective Services Registry. The OA receives allegations of abuse, neglect and financial exploitation from APS as reported by complainants to the APS telephone hotline. These reports are received generally within 2 business days of the allegation being reported. The OA gathers information about the types of allegations and providers to identify patterns and trends. The OA monitors allegations on an ongoing basis. Summary and analytic reports are developed regarding allegations and findings. These reports are shared with the MA on a quarterly basis during the Quality Management meetings. Summary reports that do not contain confidential information are posted on the OA website. Both the MA and the OA work together to review performance measures on documentation of the notification to customers of the Rights of the Customer, the reporting of customer deaths, and critical incidents and follow-up methods.

Adm. Code 119, Developmental Training, 59 Ill. Adm. Code 115, Community Integrated Living Arrangements, 59 Ill. Adm. Code 120, Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services Waiver Program for Individuals with Developmental Disabilities, 405 ILCS 5 Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code, etc.) whichever is more restrictive to the use of Restraint. Restraint shall be used only when the customer's behavior presents an immediate threat of serious physical harm to the customer or others and other less restrictive and intrusive measures have been tried and proven ineffective in stopping the immediate threat of serious physical harm. Restraint shall not be used as discipline or punishment, convenience for staff, retaliation, a substitute for appropriate physical or behavioral support, a routine safety matter, or to prevent property damage in the absence of an immediate threat of serious physical harm to the customer or others. The use of Restraint shall be subject to the following requirements and limitations. Restraints are only permitted if agreed to by the customer and/or guardian and included in the PCP. Staff who care for customers who have a restraint in their PCP are provided training on the restraint prior to providing care to the customer. There are restraint training courses available online that teach modern, evidence based de-escalation, crisis prevention, and/or physical intervention techniques for an array of provider types. Courses follow Mandt System of restraint techniques, which utilizes a comprehensive, integrated approach to preventing, de- escalating, and if necessary, intervening when the behavior of an individual poses a threat of harm to themselves and/or others. The Mandt System includes the use of restraint only within the context of a larger restraint reduction methodology. Prevention is the primary strategy for managing aggression, followed by de-escalation tactics. Such courses include but are not limited to Dynamis Training and Insight (https://www.dynamis.training/restraint/), the Crisis Prevention Institute (https://www.crisisprevention.com/), and Certified Restraint and De-escalation Training (https://certifiedrestraint.com/). Each training course has their own techniques for restraining individuals. Most courses also teach non-restraint topics that generally include warning signs of stress, verbal and non- verbal de-escalation, safety when implementing a restraint, and restraint only as a last resort. Types of restraints which are prohibited include prone restraint, supine restraint, mechanical restraint, and chemical restraint other than those medications legally prescribed and administered as part of a customer's regular medical regimen. Allowable restraints are: One Person Supportive Guide; Two Person Supportive Guide; One Person Stability Hold Procedure; Two Person Stability Hold Procedure; and Forward Escort. A) Restraint may only be employed when: 1. It is included as a modification of rights in a customer's Person-Centered Plan (PCP); 2. The use of Restraint has been discussed and approved for inclusion in the customer's PCP by the customer or guardian, if applicable, and the Provider Support Team; 3. It is included in the customer's behavior plan; 4. The use of Restraint has gone through the Behavioral Management Committee/Human Rights Committee for approval; 5. The inclusion of Restraint in the customer's PCP and behavior plan must include a plan to reduce and ultimately eliminate the use of Restraint, as appropriate; 6. The staff applying the Restraint have been trained in the use of Restraint, as described below, as well as the specific type of the Restraint to be used on the customer; 7. The provider agency has reviewed and determined that there are no known medical or psychological limitations that contraindicate the use of the Restraint; 8. The provider agency has included in the individual rights documentation information for the use of Restraint within the provider agency's policies and procedures and this information has been shared with the customer and guardian, if applicable. B) Restraint must end immediately when: 1. The immediate threat of serious physical harm ends; 2. The customer indicates that they cannot breathe or staff supervising the customer recognizes they may be in respiratory distress; or Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 224 of 302 12/16/20223. The time period of 15 minutes has expired, unless approved in the customer's PCP or a supervisor has approved the instance of the Restraint going beyond 15 minutes. C) The use of Restraint must be done as follows: 1. Provider agency staff must observe and monitor the customer being physically restrained at all times during the use of Restraint. 2. The staff involved in physically restraining a customer must halt the restraint every 5 minutes to evaluate if the immediate threat of serious physical harm continues to exist. If the immediate threat of serious physical harm continues to exist, staff may continue to use the Restraint and the continued use may not be considered a separate instance of Restraint so long as the total time period of the Restraint does not exceed 15 minutes. 3. A customer shall be released from the Restraint immediately upon a determination by the staff member administering the Restraint that the customer is no longer an immediate threat of causing serious physical harm to themselves or others. 4. The Restraint shall not impair a customer's ability to breathe or communicate normally, obstruct a customer's airway, or interfere with a customer's ability to speak. If the Restraint is imposed upon a customer whose primary mode of communication is sign language or an augmentative mode, the customer shall be permitted to have their hands free of restraint for brief periods, unless the supervising staff determines this freedom appears likely to result in harm to the customer or others. D) Reporting requirements: 1. In incidents of Restraint, the provider agency shall do the following: a. Create a report on the use of Restraint. The Report shall be included in the customer's file and be available for assessment by the Bureau of Quality Management during a provider agency's review. b.

The staff involved in physically restraining a customer must halt the restraint every 5 minutes to evaluate if the immediate threat of serious physical harm continues to exist. If the immediate threat of serious physical harm continues to exist, staff may continue to use the Restraint not identified in the PCP and the continued use may not be considered a separate instance of Restraint not identified in the PCP so long as the total time period of the Restraint not identified in the PCP does not exceed 15 minutes. 3. A customer shall be released from the Restraint not identified in the PCP immediately upon a determination by the staff member administering the Restraint not identified in the PCP that the customer is no longer an immediate threat of causing serious physical harm to themselves or others. 4. The Restraint not identified in the PCP shall not impair a customer's ability to breathe or communicate normally, obstruct a customer's airway, or interfere with a customer's ability to speak. If the Restraint not identified in the PCP is imposed upon a customer whose primary mode of communication is sign language or an augmentative mode, the customer shall be permitted to have their hands free of restraint for brief periods, unless the supervising staff determines this freedom appears likely to result in harm to the customer or others. 5. After Restraint not identified in the PCP has been used, the provider agency shall work with the ISC to determine whether Restraint should be included in the customer's PCP and behavior plan moving forward. D) Reporting requirements: 1. In incidents of Restraint not identified in the PCP, the provider agency shall do the following: a. Create a report on the use of Restraint not identified in the PCP. The Report shall be included in the customer's file and be available for assessment by the Bureau of Quality Management during a provider agency's review. b. Review any use of Restraint not identified in the PCP via the Human Rights Committee. 2. Any incident of Restraint not identified in the PCP shall be reported to the provider agency Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer. 3.

The OA contracts with Independent Service Coordination (ISC) agencies to monitor the unauthorized use of Restraint of customers. The ISC conducts a minimum of four visits per year to develop the PCP and monitor the PCP's implementation, including direct, in-person contact with the customer. The ISC's are QIDPs and are subject to mandatory reporting requirements. ISC's monitor through on-site observations, interviews, and record reviews. Any potential abuse, including the unauthorized use of Restraint would be reported to the OIG or APS (if applicable). Any findings of unauthorized use of Restraint or of injuries to customers resulting from the use of Restraint regardless of authorization, are required to be reported by the ISC entities to the OA via the OA's Critical Incident Reporting and Analysis System (CIRAS). Findings are documented on the ISC Visiting Notes form, discussed with the provider, and addressed as necessary. Addressing the findings may include reporting potential abuse to the appropriate entity (OIG and/or APS), working with the provider to develop or modify behavior plans and/or any additional action that may be appropriate to the specific circumstances. If the ISC and provider agency are unable to develop or modify and implement a behavior plan to ensure the unauthorized use of Restraint doesn't happen again, the ISC should refer the matter to the OA using the \"Monitoring and Technical Assistance Tool\" located here: https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=56646. The referral must be sent to the OA within two business days. Upon receipt, the referral will be assigned to the appropriate Bureau within the OA for appropriate follow up. The assigned Bureau Chief is responsible for ensuring appropriate and timely follow up. Depending on the nature of the concern being raised by the ISC, the Division may involve additional resources, such as the Support Service Team (SST) and the Bureau of Accreditation, Licensure and Certification (BALC). Provider agencies are required to report the unauthorized use of Restraint, including any instances not in compliance with State regulations, through CIRAS. If a provider agency is submitting a high number of unauthorized use of Restraint reports through CIRAS, the OA could complete an unannounced review of the provider agency to determine what is causing the high volume of unauthorized Restraint. The OA reviews a statistically valid sample of provider agencies and waiver customers each year to detect the unauthorized use of Restraint, also identifying any service implementation issues such as overuse or inappropriate or ineffective use of Restraint. In completing this review, the OA reviews records; conducts on-site observations; and interviews staff, customers, and guardians. The OA tracks and analyzes reports received from ISC agencies. The OA maintains a Service Issues Log for this purpose. Summary and analytical data is produced from the log on a quarterly basis and shared and discussed with the MA during the quarterly waiver quality management meetings. In addition to ensuring individual issues are resolved, the OA and MA identify system issues and implement enhancements when necessary. If a trend is identified with a provider agency, the provider agency would be required to submit an approved corrective action plan to the OA. The OA may impose sanctions upon the provider agency up to and including termination of the provider agency.

Safeguards Concerning the Use of Restrictive Interventions. Specify the safeguards that the state has in effect concerning the use of interventions that restrict participant movement, participant access to other individuals, locations or activities, restrict participant rights or employ aversive methods (not including restraints or seclusion) to modify behavior. State laws, regulations, and policies referenced in the specification are available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency. Providers may use restrictive interventions as a means of last resort and only when necessary to keep individuals safe. When a restrictive intervention is used, there must be safeguards in place to ensure that the restrictive intervention is necessary. The following details the safeguards required to be in place: 1. The Human Rights Committee and Behavior Management Committee must review interventions as indicated by waiver, Rule and DDD policy. 2. An assessment is completed prior to implementation. The assessment must take into consideration a person's medical, emotional, behavioral, environmental and motivational factors. 3. Staff must be appropriately trained on interventions prior to implementing them. 4. Individuals must be informed of the restrictive measure and should be given the option to collaborate as appropriate. 5. Restrictive interventions must be reviewed annually (or more frequently). Providers may never use restrictive measures that involve the following: a restrictive intervention that is medically contraindicated; a restrictive intervention that is used as punishment; a restrictive intervention that is used for the convenience of providers; or a restrictive intervention that is a substitute for services. If a medication is being used to change maladaptive behaviors it is a restrictive intervention unless: 1. The medication is used to treat a diagnosed mental illness and the maladaptive behaviors do not warrant a behavior plan. 2. The medications prescribed are FDA approved or commonly used for the treatment of that mental illness diagnosis. 3. Medications used are being prescribed below the maximum dose listed by the Illinois DHS/OCAPs formulary. 4. No more than 3 medications are being prescribed simultaneously for that disorder. 5. No side effects of the medication/s such as sedation are interfering with the individuals adaptive functioning. 6. The person has not required any other restrictive interventions in the previous 6 months. A restrictive intervention may be instituted immediately if the individual's immediate safety is in jeopardy. If a restrictive intervention is instituted immediately, the safeguards itemized above must be completed within a week of the restrictive intervention. i. State Oversight Responsibility.

Adm. Code 116 requires that residential habilitation providers must have a registered professional nurse, advanced practice nurse, physician licensed to practice medicine in all its branches, or a physician assistant on duty or on call at all times. At least quarterly, this professional reviews medication orders, medication labels and Medication Administration Records (MAR) to ensure that medication labels and medications administered match those ordered. The professional completing the review should report any identified discrepancy to necessary parties which could include the pharmacy, medical professional, QIDP or provider administrator as necessary and ensure the discrepancy is corrected. Licensing rule 59 Ill. Adm. Code 115 requires that customers in a residential setting who are receiving prescription medications must be seen by the prescribing physician minimally every six months to review the medication use, and minimally every three months if the customer is receiving psychotropic medications. A psychiatrist will either review psychotropic medications or be available for consultation when psychotropic medications have been prescribed for a customer. A physician or pharmacist shall make available to employees, family and customers information on expected consequences, potential benefits and side effects of any prescribed medication. For customers receiving psychotropic medications, a screening for and documentation of abnormal involuntary movements, including tardive dyskinesia, is completed at least every six months by a licensed health care professional or a person trained in performing this type of assessment. The assessment is maintained in the customer's file with the residential provider. If there is an abnormal screening based on the assessment, the prescribing professional must be notified. Use of psychotropic medications to modify or control behaviors or treatment of mental illness is considered a restrictive intervention. As such, it is also subject to the provider requirements for oversight by a properly constituted human rights committee as described in G-2. During its licensure surveys, the Bureau of Accreditation, Licensure, and Certification (BALC) reviews whether the required supervision and assessments by licensed professionals described above occur within the time frames required by rule. In addition, registered professional nurses employed by the OA conduct on-site visits to ensure compliance with 59 Ill. Adm. Code 116 regarding the review of all medications, including behavior modifying medications. These reviews include, but are not limited to, physician oversight, nursing supervision, administration, record-keeping, storage, disposal, errors, and harmful or unsafe practices. The protocol used by the licensure teams and the protocol used by the nurses are available upon request from the OA. Community Day Service (CDS) providers, including Developmental Training providers, are permitted to allow non-licensed direct support persons to administer medications in accordance with Administrative Rule 116. Methods of State Oversight and Follow-Up. Describe: (a) the method(s) that the state uses to ensure that participant medications are managed appropriately, including: (a) the identification of potentially harmful practices (e.g., the concurrent use of contraindicated medications); (b) the method(s) for following up on potentially harmful practices; and, (c) the state agency (or agencies) that is responsible for follow-up and oversight. ii. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 232 of 302 12/16/2022(a) the identification of potentially harmful practices (e.g., the concurrent use of contraindicated medications); Residential providers subject to medication administration requirements are monitored by the OA for compliance. OA staff monitoring for compliance are all registered nurses. Providers are required to track all medication errors and to report to the OA all errors with an adverse outcome (defined as requiring medical attention) by fax to the OA's Bureau of Quality Management (BQM). The error reports are forwarded to the OA's nurse reviewers for review and follow up with the provider. Per Title 59 Illinois Administrative Code Part 116, a medication error shall be immediately reported to the registered professional nurse, advanced practice nurse, physician, physician assistant, dentist, podiatrist or certified optometrist to receive direction on actions to be taken. All medication errors shall be documented in the customer's clinical record and a medication error report shall be completed within eight hours or before the end of the shift in which the error was discovered, whichever is earlier. A copy of the medication error report shall be maintained as part of the agency's quality assurance program. (b) the method(s) for following up on potentially harmful practices; Any medication error that results in an adverse outcome is reported to the OA within seven calendar days. All reports are reviewed by the OA, coordinated with an OIG investigation, and followed up as necessary to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to prevent future occurrences. Based on the outcome of an OIG investigation, the OIG makes recommendations to the provider and requires a corrective action plan. In instances where potentially harmful practices are identified, the OA provides technical assistance to the provider. (c) the state agency (or agencies) that is responsible for follow-up and oversight. In addition, the OA annually conducts on-site reviews of a representative sample of customers. The OA review team includes Registered Nurses on each review. The team reviews customer medication regimen, medication administration, and compliance with rules applicable to medication management and administration. The OA monitors for the following: written policies and procedures on reviewing adverse drug reactions; written policies and procedures on the review of medication errors; whether a medication error report is made for every medication error noted on the MAR; whether a review of medication administration is conducted by the nurse- trainer on a quarterly basis and that medication labels and MARs match the physician order sheets; and whether medications are being administered as prescribed and whether refusals are documented properly; and whether medication errors are reviewed by the nurse-trainer within 7 days of each occurrence. When findings are discovered, the provider is required to develop a corrective action plan subject to the approval of the OA. The remediation must address the customer's finding(s) as well as any other similar practices involving other customers served by the provider. The provider must develop a quality assurance process to prevent future occurrences. If serious findings are discovered, an immediate corrective action can be required (meaning remediation must occur before the OA reviewer exits the provider) or within a short time frame no more than 48 hours of the completion of the review. Plans to safeguard the welfare of customers until corrective action is implemented can include increased monitoring visits or moving waiver customers either temporarily or permanently to other settings. OA findings are summarized and reported at the Waiver Quality Management meetings which includes key staff from the OA and MA.

(complete the remaining items) State Policy. Summarize the state policies that apply to the administration of medications by waiver providers or waiver provider responsibilities when participants self-administer medications, including (if applicable) policies concerning medication administration by non-medical waiver provider personnel. State laws, regulations, and policies referenced in the specification are available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency (if applicable). ii. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 234 of 302 12/16/2022When medications are provided or employees of a waiver Residential Habilitation provider supervise their administration, the provider must ensure that such medications are provided and their administration is supervised in accordance with the Illinois Nursing and Advanced Practice Nursing Act (225 ILCS 65). Residential Habilitation service providers may allow non-licensed direct support persons to administer medications if the provider complies with the Administration of Medication in Community Settings rule (59 Ill. Adm. Code 116). When providers supervise the self-administration of medication training programs or administer the medications, medications must be secured from unauthorized access and only a physician, pharmacist, registered or licensed practical nurse or agency employee authorized to supervise the self-administration of medication training program or administer medications may have access to medications. A physician, pharmacist or registered professional nurse must be available at all times to consult with trained, unlicensed direct support employees administering medications or supervising a self-administration of medications training program for customers with developmental disabilities. A medical professional must evaluate the ability of the customer to self-administer medications. Ability to self- administer medication must be reassessed at least annually. Customers must be evaluated using OA approved screening and assessment tools, in accordance with 59 Ill. Adm. Code 116. A prescribing medical professional must provide the written order for a waiver customer to self-administer medications or participate in a self-administration of medication training program based on the results of the customer's evaluation. The order must become part of the customer's record. The provider must ensure and document the following: -A prescribing medical professional must be responsible for the medical services provided to customers, and the management of a customer's medications. -Only a medical professional, that is, a physician licensed pursuant to the Medical Practice Act, advanced practice nurse licensed pursuant to the Nursing and Advanced Practice Nursing Act, and physician's assistant licensed pursuant to Physician Assistant's Practice Act, may prescribe and monitor all prescription medications. -All medications, including patent or proprietary medications, e.g., cathartics, headache remedies, or vitamins, may be given only upon the written order of a competent medical professional. Rubber stamp signatures are not acceptable. All orders must be given as prescribed by the medical professional and at the designated time. A registered professional nurse or licensed practical nurse may take telephone orders. All orders must be immediately signed by the nurse taking the order and placed in the customer's record. These orders must be countersigned or documented by facsimile prescription by the medical professional within ten working days. OA Administrative Rule 116 permits a registered nurse who has successfully completed the OA/IDHS-approved nurse-trainer course for medication administration in the community (5 hours) to authorize direct support personnel to administer medication in residential sites. Authorized direct support personnel must be at least eighteen, have completed high school or G.E.D., demonstrate functional literacy, and have successfully completed 8 hours of classroom training on medication administration. In addition, competency-based training is required specific to the customer, the medication, and the dosages. Direct support personnel are authorized to administer only those specific medications to specific customers for which they have successfully completed training and competency evaluations. Authorized direct support personnel are re-evaluated by a nurse-trainer at least annually to ensure competency to administer each medication to each customer. The MAR for the current month must be kept with the medications or in the customer's record. The MAR must be completed and initialed immediately after the medication is administered. Each MAR must have a section that contains the full signature and title of each person who initials it. All changes in medication must be noted on the MAR by a nurse, physician, physician assistant, dentist, podiatrist, or certified optometrist and shared with administering staff prior to the next dose. Upon the direct instruction of a Nurse-Trainer, authorized direct care staff may indicate on the MAR completion of the following actions: discontinuation of a medication, change in medication schedule, and/or application of a medication information label issued with a medication by a licensed pharmacy. Customer refusal to take a medication must be noted on the MAR and in the customer's record indicating the reason for the refusal The RN Trainer should be notified of the medication refusal. An individual Medication Administration Record (MAR) must be kept for each customer for medication administered. It must contain at least the following: Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 235 of 302 12/16/20221) the customer's name; 2) the name and dosage form of the drug; 3) the name of the prescribing physician, physician assistant advanced practice nurse, dentist, podiatrist, or certified optometrist; 4) dose; 5) frequency or times of administration; 6) route of administration; 7) date and time given; 8) customer's allergies to medication; and 9) any special considerations. For waiver customers who are independently self-administering medications, no MAR is required; however, the provider must track and document that the medications are being taken by the customer. Medication Error Reporting. Select one of the following: Providers that are responsible for medication administration are required to both record and report medication errors to a state agency (or agencies). Complete the following three items: (a) Specify state agency (or agencies) to which errors are reported: Medication errors are defined in 59 Ill. Adm. Code 116 as: The administration of medication other than as prescribed, resulting in the wrong medication being given; or medication being given at the wrong time, in the wrong dosage, via the wrong route, or by the wrong person; or medication omitted entirely. It is meant to include a lack of documentation of medication administration or any error in that documentation. Medication errors must be documented and are subject to review by the OA. Medication errors that meet the reporting criteria in IDHS' rules on Office of Inspector General Investigations of Alleged Abuse or Neglect or Deaths in State-Operated and Community Agency Facilities (59 Ill. Adm. Code 50) shall be reported to the Office of Inspector General. Medication errors which result in an adverse outcome (defined as requiring medical attention) are reported by fax to the OA's Bureau of Quality Management (BQM). The error reports are forwarded to the OA's nurse reviewers for review and follow up with the provider. (b) Specify the types of medication errors that providers are required to record: Waiver Residential Habilitation providers are required to record all medication errors. Medication errors are defined in 59 Ill. Adm. Code 116 as: The administration of medication other than as prescribed, resulting in the wrong medication being given; or medication being given at the wrong time, in the wrong dosage, via the wrong route, or by the wrong person; medication omitted entirely; or the customer refuses the medication. It is meant to include a lack of documentation of medication administration or any error in that documentation. (c) Specify the types of medication errors that providers must report to the state: iii. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 236 of 302 12/16/2022Residential providers subject to medication administration requirements are monitored by the OA for compliance. Providers are required to track all medication errors and to report to the OA all errors with an adverse outcome (defined as requiring medical attention) by fax to the OA's Bureau of Quality Management (BQM). The error reports are forwarded to the OA's nurse reviewers for review and follow up with the provider. Any medication error that results in an adverse outcome is reported to the OA within seven calendar days. All reports are reviewed by the OA, coordinated with an OIG investigation, and followed up as necessary to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to prevent future occurrences. Also, any medication errors that are reported through the critical incident reporting process are also reviewed by the OA and the MA at the quarterly waiver compliance management meetings. Providers responsible for medication administration are required to record medication errors but make information about medication errors available only when requested by the state. Specify the types of medication errors that providers are required to record: State Oversight Responsibility. Specify the state agency (or agencies) responsible for monitoring the performance of waiver providers in the administration of medications to waiver participants and how monitoring is performed and its frequency. iv. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 237 of 302 12/16/2022Residential providers subject to medication administration requirements are monitored by the OA for compliance. Providers are required to track all medication errors and to report to the OA all errors with an adverse outcome (defined as requiring medical attention) through the Critical Incident Reporting and Auditing System (CIRAS). Any medication error that results in an adverse outcome is reported to the OA within seven calendar days. All reports are reviewed by the OA, coordinated with an OIG investigation, and followed up as necessary to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to prevent future occurrences. The OA reviews a representative sample of waiver customers annually. The OA review team includes Registered Nurses on each review. The team reviews customer medication regimen, medication administration, all medication errors, and compliance with rules applicable to medication management and administration. The OA monitors for the following: written policies and procedures on reviewing adverse drug reactions; written policies and procedures on the review of medication errors; whether a medication error report is made for every medication error noted on the MAR; whether a review of medication administration is conducted by the nurse- trainer on a quarterly basis and that labels match the physician order sheets; and whether medications are being administered as prescribed and whether refusals are documented properly; and whether medication errors are reviewed by the nurse-trainer with 7 days of each occurrence. A medication error shall be immediately reported to the registered professional nurse, advanced practice nurse, physician, physician assistant, dentist, podiatrist, or certified optometrist to receive direction on actions to be taken. All medication errors shall be documented in the customer's clinical record and a medication error report shall be completed within eight hours or before the end of the shift in which the error was discovered, whichever is earlier. A copy of the medication error report shall be maintained as part of the agency's quality assurance program. In addition to the review of all medication errors through its representative sample of waiver customers, as well as its review of providers' written policies and procedures on the review of medication errors, any medication error that results in an adverse outcome is reported to the OA within seven calendar days. All reports are reviewed by the OA and followed up as necessary to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to prevent future occurrences. When findings are discovered, the provider is required to develop a corrective action plan subject to the approval of the OA. The remediation must address the customer's finding(s) as well as any other similar practices involving other customers served by the provider. The provider must develop a quality assurance process to prevent future occurrences. If serious findings are discovered, an immediate corrective action can be required (meaning remediation must occur before the OA reviewer exits the provider) or within a short time frame no more than 48 hours of the completion of the review. Plans to safeguard the welfare of customers until a corrective action is implemented can include increased monitoring visits or moving waiver customers either temporarily or permanently to other settings. OA findings are summarized and reported at the Waiver Quality Management meetings which includes key staff from the OA and MA. The Waiver Quality Management team meets quarterly and develops appropriate system improvements in response to identified trends and concerns.

Remediation must be completed within 30 days. G5: The OA will follow up all outstanding APS referrals of substantiated incidents of confinement. Changes in customer's PCP, corrective action plans or provider sanctions will be made when needed. Remediation must be completed within 30 days. G6: The OA will follow up to ensure that training has been provided on alternative practices to restrictive interventions, including restraints and seclusion, within 30 days of notification. Training sign-in sheets will be reviewed to ensure all staff completed the training. G7: If identifying information is available for individual surveys, the ISC staff will follow up on non-favorable surveys. Resolution or remediation will be based on the nature of the concern. Patterns of negative responses, including anonymous survey responses, will be used to identify need for system improvement. G8: During the initial evaluation or redetermination, the ISC staff will ask whether the customer has a primary care doctor or practitioner and whether they had a physical in the last 12 months. If not, barriers will be identified and addressed. Remediation will occur at the meeting between customer and ISC staff. The OA is responsible for seeing that these individual findings are resolved. The OA provides quarterly reports of these activities to the MA. Staff of the two State agencies review the reports on a quarterly basis.

No Yes Please provide a detailed strategy for assuring Health and Welfare, the specific timeline for implementing identified strategies, and the parties responsible for its operation. c. Appendix H: Quality Improvement Strategy (1 of 3) Under \u00a71915(c) of the Social Security Act and 42 CFR \u00a7441.302, the approval of an HCBS waiver requires that CMS determine that the state has made satisfactory assurances concerning the protection of participant health and welfare, financial accountability and other elements of waiver operations. Renewal of an existing waiver is contingent upon review by CMS and a finding by CMS that the assurances have been met. By completing the HCBS waiver application, the state specifies how it has designed the waiver's critical processes, structures and operational features in order to meet these assurances. Quality Improvement is a critical operational feature that an organization employs to continually determine whether it operates in accordance with the approved design of its program, meets statutory and regulatory assurances and requirements, achieves desired outcomes, and identifies opportunities for improvement. CMS recognizes that a state's waiver Quality Improvement Strategy may vary depending on the nature of the waiver target population, the services offered, and the waiver's relationship to other public programs, and will extend beyond regulatory requirements. However, for the purpose of this application, the state is expected to have, at the minimum, systems in place to measure and improve its own performance in meeting six specific waiver assurances and requirements. It may be more efficient and effective for a Quality Improvement Strategy to span multiple waivers and other long-term care services. CMS recognizes the value of this approach and will ask the state to identify other waiver programs and long-term care services that are addressed in the Quality Improvement Strategy. Quality Improvement Strategy: Minimum Components The Quality Improvement Strategy that will be in effect during the period of the approved waiver is described throughout the waiver in the appendices corresponding to the statutory assurances and sub-assurances. Other documents cited must be available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency (if appropriate). In the QIS discovery and remediation sections throughout the application (located in Appendices A, B, C, D, G, and I) , a state spells out: The evidence based discovery activities that will be conducted for each of the six major waiver assurances; and The remediation activities followed to correct individual problems identified in the implementation of each of the assurances. In Appendix H of the application, a state describes (1) the system improvement activities followed in response to aggregated, analyzed discovery and remediation information collected on each of the assurances; (2) the correspondent roles/responsibilities of those conducting assessing and prioritizing improving system corrections and improvements; and (3) the processes the state will follow to continuously assess the effectiveness of the OIS and revise it as necessary and appropriate.Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 253 of 302 12/16/2022If the state's Quality Improvement Strategy is not fully developed at the time the waiver application is submitted, the state may provide a work plan to fully develop its Quality Improvement Strategy, including the specific tasks the state plans to undertake during the period the waiver is in effect, the major milestones associated with these tasks, and the entity (or entities) responsible for the completion of these tasks. When the Quality Improvement Strategy spans more than one waiver and/or other types of long-term care services under the Medicaid state plan, specify the control numbers for the other waiver programs and/or identify the other long-term services that are addressed in the Quality Improvement Strategy. In instances when the QIS spans more than one waiver, the state must be able to stratify information that is related to each approved waiver program. Unless the state has requested and received approval from CMS for the consolidation of multiple waivers for the purpose of reporting, then the state must stratify information that is related to each approved waiver program, i.e., employ a representative sample for each waiver. Appendix H: Quality Improvement Strategy (2 of 3) H-1: Systems Improvement System Improvements Describe the process(es) for trending, prioritizing, and implementing system improvements (i.e., design changes) prompted as a result of an analysis of discovery and remediation information. i. a. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 254 of 302 12/16/2022The Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, as the single State Medicaid Agency (MA), and the Illinois Department of Human Services, Division of Developmental Disabilities, as the Operating Agency (OA) work in partnership to evaluate the waiver Quality Management System (QMS). This partnership provides analysis to information derived from discovery and collaboratively develops and monitors remediation activities for each of the federal assurances. The OA and MA share reports that track changes in compliance levels for performance measures over time. This includes tracking changes across the entire state. This helps to identify problematic areas and potential best practices. Together, the MA and OA aggregate information and generate reports on a quarterly basis. The OA currently receives and maintains data from the Abuse/Neglect/Exploitation database and the Complaint database, and the Critical Incident Reporting and Analysis System (CIRAS) database. Summary information and trend analysis is discussed during quarterly Waiver Quality Management Committee meetings of the MA and OA staff. Necessary remediation is identified and documented on the System Improvement Log maintained by the MA. The OA is responsible for the majority of the data collection to address the Quality Management System discovery and remediation activities. The OA is primarily responsible for eligibility and authorizing qualified providers. Therefore, there are distinct performance measures for these functions under the OA. Additionally, as a result of enhancements in the MA's data systems, the MA now includes qualified provider performance measures. The MA is specifically accountable for the measures in Appendix C Qualified Providers. The state's system improvement activities are in response to aggregated and analyzed discovery and remediation data collected on each of the waiver performance measures. The sources of discovery evidence vary, but all are based on either a 100% review or the representative sampling methodology as indicated for each performance measure. The OA annually selects a representative sample of waiver customers. Onsite, desk audit, remote or virtual, as appropriate, reviews are scheduled and conducted throughout the year at Independent Service Coordination agencies and waiver service providers. Data is collected throughout the year and individual problems are remediated as they are identified. Other data sources include the State Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) and other reports as indicated in the waiver. The OA takes a multi-phased and multilevel approach to using reports to improve the overall system. Because changes in the compliance level for a performance measure may be explained by an external factor that would not require remediation (e.g., better targeting of customers with greater impairment than may have an adverse impact on some of the performance measures), the first step is to investigate to try to determine if an actual problem exists. The second step is to formulate potential interventions that may remediate the problem. The third step is to roll out those interventions, possibly on a pilot basis. The final step is to track changes using the original performance measures to assess the impact of intervention. The state's quality oversight system between the MA and the OA is hierarchical. With regards to waiver management, the process described above is multilevel. The MA oversees the OA, which oversees the ISC agencies, which employs the independent service coordinators. Consequently, the state's quality management system includes regular and structured oversight meetings to facilitate communication, investigation, and problem solving across the many levels. The OA meets with all ISC agencies at least quarterly and meets with a representative sample of independent service coordinators at least annually, and more often if required due to performance issues. The OA and MA meet quarterly. The Adults with Developmental Disabilities waiver Quality Improvement Plan (QIP) is part of an overall quality management plan for the three 1915 (c) waivers operated by the IDHS, Division of Developmental Disabilities (OA). The other waivers include the Children's Support Waiver (0464), and the Children's Residential Waiver (0473). While some data may be collected during the same on-site provider reviews, the sample for each waiver is drawn separately and the results aggregated separately. On a quarterly basis, the MA conducts Quality Management Committee (QMC) meetings with the OA to review data collected from the previous quarter and for the year to date. Data is collected on a regular basis and is reported as indicated by the performance measure in the waiver. All reports will be provided to the MA for review prior to the quarterly meetings. Annual reports are produced identifying trends based on the representative sample Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 255 of 302 12/16/2022and/or 100% review of data. The OA reports on all data collected for the three developmental disabilities waivers, however data is reported separately, by waiver. Data is reported by individual performance measure and in total for comparison to all performance measures. Individual performance measure reports include timeliness of remediation based on immediate, 30, 60, 90-day increments and remediations outstanding. During quarterly meetings, the MA and the OA identify trends based on scope, severity, changes and patterns of compliance by reviewing both the levels of compliance with the performance measures and remediation activities conducted by the OA. Identified trends are discussed and analyzed regarding cause, contributing factors and opportunities for system improvement. Systems improvement is prioritized based on the overall impact to the customers and the program. System improvements may be prioritized based on factors such as: the impact on the health and welfare of waiver customers, legislative considerations, and fiscal considerations. Decisions and timelines for system improvement are based on consensus of priority and specific steps needed to accomplish change. These decisions are documented and communicated through the sharing of the quarterly meeting summary.

Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 256 of 302 12/16/2022For the OA, the state uses the same mechanisms that it uses to identify potential issues including contract compliance, customer satisfaction, assurances, and critical incident analysis to monitor the effectiveness of all interventions. The state tracks changes in the performance measures using data analysis and reports. For the OA, customer input also plays a central role in the QIP as follows: Customers' perception of the quality of their services using constructs that are meaningful to customers (e.g., integration in the community, dignity, respect, etc.) as gathered through customer satisfaction tools and the assessment tool. These tools provide the OA with the direct feedback loop about the effect of potential interventions on the quality of life for individual customers. The processes Illinois follows to continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the QIP are the same processes to evaluate the information derived from discovery and remediation activities. The Waiver Quality Management Committee (QMC) uses documentation that is discussed quarterly by key staff of the MA and the OA regarding progress, updates, and evaluation of effectiveness. Effectiveness is measured by impact on performance based on ongoing data collection over time, feedback from customer/guardian interviews, surveys, and service providers. Multiple years of data collection will allow the State to evaluate the effectiveness of system improvements over time. One meeting of the Waiver QMC each year is partly devoted to an overview of the previous year's activities and a discussion of whether changes are needed to the QIP. System design changes may be specific to the OA or one waiver or may involve multiple waivers. The purpose of meeting annually is to provide an arena to see the system holistically, determine how well the system design changes are working, and identify areas that require further improvement. In the OA QIP, the State has implemented additional efforts to address its ability to improve and maintain quality. These include: 1) Updated performance measures in each of the waiver areas, 2) Redesigned reports to be used on a quarterly basis, 3) Updated CIRAS Manual updating and clarifying reporting processes, enrollment processes, reporting requirements, definitions of critical incidents Event Report system and clearer delineation of critical incident definitions and follow-up procedures including training for ISCs and service providers on reporting and management of critical events, 4) Implementation of new process and tracking system for implementation deadlines for substantiated OIG findings, 5) Implementation of additional review questions to evaluate customer satisfaction. The OA meets with the Developmental Disabilities Advisory Committee (DDAC) multiple times a year to present information about the waiver and receive input from providers, stakeholders, and customer representatives. The DDAC has several temporary work groups to address identified topics, including a technology work group and home-based services work group. This process of inclusion of stakeholders has been most effective and is viewed by the OA as a critical element in its QIP. Meeting dates and times are shared with the MA for their information and participation. Describe the process to periodically evaluate, as appropriate, the Quality Improvement Strategy. ii. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 257 of 302 12/16/2022During the quarterly meetings with the OA, the OA and MA review Performance Measure reporting and the QIP. The OA and the MA discuss updates that both Departments need to address in the future. The OA also seeks input from its DDAC and advocacy groups on improvements and/or changes to the QIP. The OA continually addresses issues as they arise, responds, and implements strategies to improve compliance with performance indicators. The whole QIP is viewed as a continuous ongoing process. One wavier QMC meeting a year is dedicated to discussing statewide issues impacting the waiver. During this annual meeting, the OA has on the agenda an overview of the previous year's activities and a discussion of whether changes are needed to the QIP. The MA and the OA see five primary focus areas: These areas are described below. 1) Structure of the QMC: The group reviews the structure of the QMC to determine if it is effective. 2) Trend Analysis: The group evaluates the processes for identifying trends, patterns, and root causes to assure that issues are being identified and analyzed. 3) Systems Improvement: The group reviews the QIP documentation to assure that all recommendations have been implemented in accordance with agreed upon timelines, and if not, whether there is justification. 4) System Improvement Priorities: The methods for determining system improvement priorities are evaluated to determine effectiveness. 5) Performance Measures: The entities determine whether to make changes in existing performance measures, add measures, or discontinue measures. Other elements of performance measures are reviewed for effectiveness, including: the frequency of data collection, source of data, sampling methodology, and remediation. The state continuously strives to increase the compliance rate of each performance measure. While the target compliance rate for each performance measure is 100%, the state realizes that it may take multiple system changes over several years to reach the goal of 100% compliance, as well as, all entities involve experience staff changes that require ongoing training.

Appendix I: Financial Accountability I-1: Financial Integrity and Accountability Financial Integrity. Describe the methods that are employed to ensure the integrity of payments that have been made for waiver services, including: (a) requirements concerning the independent audit of provider agencies; (b) the financial audit program that the state conducts to ensure the integrity of provider billings for Medicaid payment of waiver services, including the methods, scope and frequency of audits; and, (c) the agency (or agencies) responsible for conducting the Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 258 of 302 12/16/2022financial audit program. State laws, regulations, and policies referenced in the description are available to CMS upon request through the Medicaid agency or the operating agency (if applicable). Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 259 of 302 12/16/2022(a) requirements concerning the independent audit of provider agencies Audit requirements differ depending on the amount paid to the provider by the OA. Providers that receive from $500,000.00 to $749,999.99 from the OA must submit a financial statement audit conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS). Providers that receive $750,000.00 or more through the OA, must submit a financial statement audit conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS). Staff in the Office of Contract Administration (OCA) review the audits and ensure each agency required to complete an audit have done so. Failure to comply with reporting requirements shall result in the withholding of funds, the return of improper payments or Unallowable Costs, will be considered a material breach of this Agreement and may be the basis to recover Grant Funds. Grantee's failure to comply with Articles XIII, XIV, or XV of the Uniform Grant Agreements (UGA) shall be considered prima facie evidence of a breach and may be admitted as such, without further proof, into evidence in an administrative proceeding before Grantor, or in any other legal proceeding. Grantee should refer to the State of Illinois Grantee Compliance Enforcement System for policy and consequences for failure to comply. If the OA performs rate calculations or expense and revenue analysis, provider agencies are required to submit revenue and expense data by program in a consolidated financial report form prescribed by the OA, regardless of overall funding level. Individual providers and businesses that are not under contract with the OA are not required to obtain and submit audits on their financial information. However, the OA reserves the right to audit any provider at any time. (b) the financial audit program that the state conducts to ensure the integrity of provider billings for Medicaid payment of waiver services, including the methods, scope and frequency of audits; The Office of Contract Administration (OCA) performs desk reviews for 100% of the required provider audits on an annual basis. The types of findings and discrepancies reported by provider's independent auditors may include segregation of duties, issues with internal controls, inability to accurately prepare financial statements, misappropriation of funds, eligibility of services, accurate reporting of billings, and inappropriate costs. Once OCA completes their review of the independent provider audits, OCA submits a Desk Review Letter to the provider which closes the review, requests additional information, or identifies findings and requires a Corrective Action Plan (CAP). If a CAP is required, the provider has 30 days to submit the CAP to OCA with timelines identified to meet compliance. The provider will submit proof of compliance within the timelines or OCA will follow up with the provider until compliance is met. Copies of the independent provider audits and consolidated financial reports (CFR's) are on file with the OCA and are available to the OA upon request. These annual audits are conducted in accordance Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) or Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) depending on the level of funding that a provider receives. 30 ILCS 5/3 specifies the jurisdiction of the Auditor General and section 3-2 identifies the mandatory post audits. The Auditor General shall conduct a financial audit, a compliance audit, or other attestation engagement, as is appropriate to the agency's operations under generally accepted government auditing standards. In conjunction with HFS' portion of the Statewide Single Audit, a sample of provider billings for Medicaid payments that may include billings for Medicaid payments for waiver services is reviewed. The Illinois Office of Auditor General is responsible for conducting the financial audit program. The MA and OA work cooperatively to review rates and provider claims. The MA implements procedures that provide assurances that claims will be coded and paid in accordance with the reimbursement methodology specified in the waiver. The MA delegates to the OA the financial oversight of claims. The OA's computer system generates applicable rates and service authorizations according to the waiver program parameters for which the customer is authorized to participate. Each customer's service authorization(s) of which some are provider agency specific where only the specified provider can bill and receive payment and others are generic where any qualified and enrolled provider can bill and be paid are transmitted from the OA's computer system to the OA's Community Reimbursement Sub-system (CRS). The OA's computer system can either produce individualized or statewide rates as set by the OA's rate setting methodologies. The OA's computer system also transmits the individualized or statewide rates to the OA's (CRS) which maintains a complete historical record of every customer's authorization(s) for services and rates. CRS also contains each provider's eligibility to provide services and what services the provider is eligible to provide, bill and be paid for. Each provider or provider agency submits billing through the OA's Reporting of Community Services (ROCS) system. ROCS reporting from each provider or provider agency includes the customer's information of the first, last and middle initial of the customer's name, Social Security Number (SSN), Recipient Identification Number (RIN) if one has been assigned, and Date of Birth (DOB). The provider or provider agency also reports specific bill codes for each service delivered, quantity of services delivered and bill rate. All ROCS billing is transmitted to the CRS. The CRS batch processes all ROCS billing on a weekly basis. The CRS has edits which check for the customer's identity against the Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 260 of 302 12/16/2022customer's information in CRS. The customer's Medicaid eligibility on the day services were delivered and being billed for, the customer is authorized for the service being billed and the service was authorized for the date service(s) are being billed. The CRS also compares the provider's billing rate against either the statewide billing rate or the customer's authorized individualized rate for the applicable service and bill code. The CRS adjudicates all provider billing based on the customer's eligibility for services on the date services were delivered by the provider or provider agency. The CRS performs edit checks that the provider or provider agency is eligible to deliver the service being billed. CRS also adjudicates the payment for services based on the OA's authorized rate for the customer for each service. CRS rejects and does not pay for any services which do not pass all of the above listed edits including services provided before or after a customer's service authorization for each service. Other edits ensure appropriate billing is submitted by the provider or provider agency include that the CRS reject billing for services prior to the customer's determined date of eligibility for DD services by the ISC. Another safeguard for all provider billings is that CRS will reject any billing if the billing was previously submitted, adjudicated and paid. Provider agencies cannot bill over the authorized number of units for a day or month of service nor can a provider or provider agency bill over the annually authorized number of units of any specific service for the customer. The OA reviews 100% of claims verifying the following: 1. The customer was eligible and enrolled in the waiver on the date of service, and, 2. The rates were paid in accordance with the reimbursement methodology. In addition, the OA reviews rate calculations anytime there is a significant change in the computerized information management system. The MA also reviews the residential rate components calculated by the OA for accuracy and validity whenever residential providers receive a rate increase. Although the room and board component of a residential rate is not claimed for FFP, it is still an integral factor in the calculation of a residential rate and is included in the MA review. Further, the OA selects a representative sample of claims and conducts post-payment reviews to verify whether the services were approved in the PCP. The OA summarizes the post payment review data and provides quarterly reports to the MA of their findings and any remediation activities (on an individual and systemic basis). Remediation may include clarifying policy, retraining staff, providing technical assistance, voiding claims, increased monitoring, conducting focused reviews, or developing plans of correction, as appropriate. The OA selects a statistically valid sample from customers enrolled in the waiver using a 95% confidence level and a +/-5% margin of error and reviews 100% of the claims for the customer for services received. The OA compares the customer's PCP to services billed in order to ensure services were received as identified in the PCP. The OA ensures the provider is enrolled and approved to provide the service. The OA reviews the claims from the last SFY to ensure services were billed and paid accurately according to the waiver. The provider is notified indicating deficiencies identified and if a Corrective Action Plan is required. Annually, the OA selects a statistically valid sample (with a 95% confidence level and a +/-5% margin of error) of providers and conducts an unannounced review to ensure the corrective action plan is being followed. When inappropriate claims are identified, the OA works with the provider to correct their billing. If the correction includes a recoupment, the collection occurs through future billings submitted by the provider until the money is recouped. If a correction can't be made by recoupment, the OA submits a request to the DHS, Bureau of Collections (BOC) to establish a collection. The BOC works with the provider until the debt is collected. The system has edits in place to adjusts billings to ensure they don't get submitted for FFP. The MA performs a validation review based on the OA report to verify that post-payment review procedures were followed, and appropriate remediation actions were taken. The MA's validation review includes an assessment and review of the internal controls established by the OA. The MA assesses the appropriateness of established controls and performs tests to provide reasonable assurance that the established controls are followed. The MA uses the data warehouse to verify that claiming errors were corrected by crediting CMS with any applicable FFP. As a result of the validation review, the MA works with the OA to modify and strengthen internal controls as needed. The MA has implemented oversight procedures that provide increased assurance that claims are coded and paid in accordance with the reimbursement methodology specified in the waiver. These processes enable staff to monitor the financial aspects of the waiver from a global perspective, rather than review a sample of paid claims. The MA determined that reviewing a sample of paid claims was of limited effectiveness and would not likely disclose problematic billings, patterns and/or trends.

The OA also annually conducts a statistically valid review of Waiver customers to ensure the customer was Medicaid eligible on the date of service and that services were actually delivered. These desk reviews can include documentation reviews of eligibility assessments, attendance records, work logs, phone logs, travel logs, appointment schedules, progress notes, etc. If needed, phone interviews with guardians and providers may be included.

Include information regarding responsible parties and GENERAL methods for problem correction. In addition, provide information on the methods used by the state to document these items. I1: The MA will require the OA to void the federal claim for services provided prior to the customer's waiver enrollment. Remediation must be completed within 30 days. I2: The OA will determine whether the service was coded and paid correctly and authorized in the PCP. If missing from the PCP, the PCP will be revised to include the service. If coded and/or paid incorrectly, the OA will void the federal claim and resubmit. Remediation must be completed within 30 days. I3: The MA will require the OA to either recoup the overpayment or repay at correct rate. If necessary, it will also adjust the federal claim. Remediation must be completed within 30 days. The OA is responsible for seeing that these individual findings are resolved. The OA provides quarterly reports of these activities to the MA. Staff of the two State agencies review the reports on a quarterly basis. i.

Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 268 of 302 12/16/2022The public input process for this waiver amendment is detailed in Main Section 6-I. General All rate methodologies are established by the OA and reviewed and approved by the MA, who retains final authority over payment rates. The MA solicits public comments by means of a public notice when changes in methods and standards for establishing payment rates under the Waiver are proposed. The notice is published in accordance with Federal requirements at 42 CFR 447.205, which prescribes the content and publication criteria for the notice. Whenever rates change, a listing of all covered services and corresponding rates is made available to customers and guardians (when applicable), family members, Self-Direction Assistance providers, ISC's, and providers. Copies of rate methodologies are on file with the MA and the OA. Established rates are published on the OA's website at: https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=125310. Rates for all waiver services are reviewed on an ongoing basis by the MA and OA, at a minimum every five years. Effective, 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval, a Regional Wage Factor is being implemented, which will allow rates to vary based on geography. A geographic differential for CILA rate methodologies for customers living and being served in the City of Chicago as well as Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will counties (hereafter referred to as \"Chicago and collar counties is being implemented. Rates paid for waiver services do not differ based on provider except for Personal Support services. These rates negotiated between the customer and Personal Support Worker. The MA and OA work cooperatively to ensure payments are consistent with economy, efficiency, and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers. This is completed by performing rate studies and comparing states with similar demographic characteristics as Illinois. In August 2019, the OA contracted with Guidehouse, Inc. (\"Guidehouse\"), to serve as a rate developer to review current rate methodologies and reimbursement levels and develop recommendations for new rate methodologies and benchmark rates for Community Integrated Living Arrangement (CILA), the State's home and community based residential waiver program for Persons with Intellectual and/or Developmental Disabilities, as well as all other services used to support a customer in a residential setting to include, but not be limited to, day habilitation services, supported employment, behavior therapy services, and supplemental services. Guidehouse relied on objective, publicly available data sources, standard administrative cost-reporting, and a provider-reported cost survey specially designed for the rate development process. The objectives of the rate study aimed to determine benchmark rates based less on providers' historical costs and more on the resources required to promote access to quality services going forward. Consequently, their approach established cost assumptions on objective national and regional benchmark cost data when available, basing assumptions on provider-reported data only when more extensive industry data was unavailable or appropriate to the settings in Illinois. The specially designed and detailed provider cost and wage survey sought data from residential and day habilitation providers on costs and wages from Fiscal Year 2018. See Rate Study, page 8 for a detailed list of information sought. The rate recommendations were published in the form of a report titled \"Developmental Disabilities Services Rate Study\" (hereinafter referred to as Rate Study) in November 2020. The Rate Study can be viewed at https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=136098 for complete details on all that follows. The Rate Study identified benchmark rates and final recommendations beginning on page 70 of the report. The Rate Study also estimated the fiscal impact of all the recommendations beginning on page 79 of the report. Due to the significant financial impact of the recommendations, the OA has developed a multi-year implementation plan. Beginning in August 2018 but prior to contracting with Guidehouse in August 2019, the OA established a robust stakeholder process to seek input into the rate development process which included over 100 participants representing families, customers, service providers and advocates working in seven subject matter workgroups. The workgroups were overseen by a Rates Oversight Committee comprised of stakeholders in the system. The workgroups results were presented to Guidehouse to provide direction in the rate development process. The Oversight Committee continued to meet monthly with Guidehouse throughout the entire rate development process providing insight and feedback as the work progressed. Following the completion of the Rate Study, the OA held four webinars with stakeholders to not only discuss the results of the Rate Study, but also to solicit input on the recommendations of the Rate Study that are now the subject of this renewal. In addition, the Rate Study has been a frequent topic of the OA's weekly \"DDD Communications,\" an e-mail distributed newsletter sent to anyone who has signed up to be on the LISTSERV including providers, stakeholders, advocates, trade associations, customers, families, etc. DDD Communications can be found at: (https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=78358). The final rate report was provided to the OA, and shared with MA, the Rates Oversight Committee, waiver customers, Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 269 of 302 12/16/2022stakeholders, and interested parties in December 2020. A five-year timeline for implementation is planned pending appropriation via the Illinois General Assembly's budget process and subsequent approval by the Governor. Rate changes were implemented 1/1/2022 for Residential Habilitation, Supported Employment - Individual Employment Support, Supported Employment - Small Group Supports, Community Day Services, Behavior Intervention and Treatment, and Behavioral Services (Psychotherapy and Counseling). The State continues to analyze the fiscal impact of these increases. In the State's FY23 budget, the OA received additional funding from the Illinois General Assembly to further implement the Guidehouse Rate Study recommendations for Residential Habilitation. These increases are effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval. The last rebasing of rates was completed by the OA in 2020 when it completed the Guidehouse Rate Study. Request for Application (RFA) are posted on a website used by all State agencies to list contracting opportunities with the State. This website is referred to as the Illinois Procurement Bulletin (IPB). Vendors of all types can register on the IPB to do business with the state, to review requests for information or proposals, and receive updates on procurement rules and requirements. The RFA for this service used the IPB website. We believe this process is an effective means to identify all qualified and willing providers and to compare their costs. The Illinois General Assembly reviews funding allocations on an annual basis. We cannot predict, however, how frequently the Administration and General Assembly may consider COLAs for various services. Overview of Wages for Services effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval: Wages for Residential Habilitation, Community Day Services - On Site, Community Day Services - Off Site, Supported Employment - Individual Employment Support, and Supported Employment - Small Group Supports include an employee related expenses (ERE) factor of 25.0 - 29.9% depending on the service and the staff position. ERE includes legally required benefits such as unemployment taxes, federal insurance contributions and worker's compensation, paid time off components such as vacation, sick, personal and holiday days and other benefits such as retirement, health insurance and vision and dental insurance. See Section D.1.2, page 18, of the Rate Study for a description of what factors are included in the ERE and their calculations. Residential Habilitation: These rates were originally established by the OA and approved by the MA in 1994 and have been subject to proposed legislative increases over subsequent years. The rates were last updated 1/1/2022. These rates are being updated 1/1/23, or upon CMS approval. Residential Habilitation Services: Group and individual home settings, known as Community Integrated Living Arrangements (CILA), are funded by level of support needs based on the individual's Service Score derived from the Inventory for Client and Agency Planning (ICAP). Effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval, an adjustment factor is being implemented that is based on the customer's Health Care Level (HCL) as determined by their Health Risk Screening Tool (HRST). Health Care Level (HCL) is an additional factor in determining the number of DSP hours calculated for a customer in 24-Hour CILA. This factor is incorporating additional DSP time to facilitate customers in getting to and from needed medical appointments. This also implements one of the Guidehouse Rate Study recommendations. Customers with higher HCL Scores will have additional DSP time incorporated into their CILA Rate as a higher HCL score objectively measures and quantifies a customer's health need(s). There are three types of CILA services: 24-hour CILA, Host Family and Intermittent. Though Enhanced Residential is identified in the Residential Habilitation service definition, its rate methodology aligns with Community Day Services. General Description of the three CILA Types: For a general description of all three CILA types, please refer to Appendix C, Service Definitions. Rate Components Common to all Three CILA Types: Program Component: The Program component of the rate methodology reimburses providers for those costs incurred in providing habilitation services and supports. Included in the program component are reimbursement for base staffing costs, Qualified Intellectual Disabilities Professional (QIDP) staffing costs, Supervisor staffing costs, supply costs, miscellaneous consultant services costs and nursing costs. On 7/1/2022, the Direct Service Professional (DSP) funded Wage Rate was set at $16.00. The DSP rate was initially set in 1994 and increased subsequently with periodic COLAs and wage increases authorized through legislative approval. Effective 7/1/2022, the QIDP and Supervisor Wage Rates were established by using the 2018 Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) median wage and adjusting for present day. A 25% Employment Related Expenses (ERE) factor is calculated on Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 270 of 302 12/16/2022all staff wages. Hourly wages determined by BLS Occupational Statistics are adjusted annually. The OA is further implementing recommendations in the Guidehouse Rate Study. Effective 1/1/2023, or upon CMS approval, the Direct Service Professional (DSP) funded Wage Rate will increase to $17.00 statewide and a Regional Wage Factor of 15% to $19.55 will be implemented for DSP funded Wage Rates in Chicago and collar counties. The QIDP, Supervisor and RN funded Wage Rates will be increased to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) median wage. The wages are reviewed and adjusted annually using the most current BLS median wage and increased based on the percentage increase received by the DSPs in order to avoid compression in the wage bands. The same 15% Regional Wage Factor is being implemented for these job titles for people living in and being served in Chicago and collar counties. The ERE is being increased to 29.9% for DSPs and ERE from 24.9% to 28.1% for the other named job titles as specified in the Guidehouse Rate Study (See D.1.2, Table 7). CONTINUED IN MAIN B OPTIONAL UNDER APPENDIX I-2-a Flow of Billings. Describe the flow of billings for waiver services, specifying whether provider billings flow directly from providers to the state's claims payment system or whether billings are routed through other intermediary entities. If billings flow through other intermediary entities, specify the entities: b. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 271 of 302 12/16/2022Provider Payment Fee-for-Service providers are paid by the OA. Providers may bill Medicaid directly. Waiver funding is appropriated to the OA primarily from the State's General Revenue Fund. The OA maintains a computerized payment system that includes PCP authorization for each customer, payments to provider agencies, units of service delivered to each eligible customer, and payment and claiming rates per unit of service. The OA authorizes services in advance of service delivery. The provider and/or the customer, if the customer is receiving Personal Support Worker services, report and certify that the service was delivered, and the OA approves payment for the service. A voucher document is utilized in this payment process and constitutes a legal agreement between the OA and the provider. The OA payment system contains edits to ensure that payments are made only when the customer is authorized for the program services delivered, via the PCP that specifies the program services, the provider of the program services, the amount the services authorized, providers that are properly enrolled for the services delivered, and that payment is made at the correct payment rate. The OA's software system processes all parts of the billings and claims but the State's Comptroller creates the payment vouchers to pay the provider agencies. There is a three-party Medicaid Waiver provider agreement (HFS 1413) between the provider, the OA and the MA. Payments for some services, such as customer-directed Personal Support services where the customer exercises employer authority, flow through the Financial Management Service (FMS) entity and are paid and transmitted to the OA system for claims processing. OA Claims Processing Information from the OA's computerized payment system feeds into the computerized claiming system that contains edits to ensure that the customer has been determined to meet the ICF/IID level of care prior to the date of service. The OA claiming system picks up the established claiming rate and compares it with the actual payment rate; the lower of the two is the amount claimed. Finally, the OA claiming system subtracts from the Waiver claim the spenddown obligation of each customer, if any (available on a monthly extract from the MA's MMIS system). Valid billing submissions are submitted to the MA on a weekly basis, to determine Medicaid eligibility. The MA then returns a weekly file to the OA with an OBRA indicator code for all those customers who met the eligibility criteria. Customers who were not returned with an OBRA indicator code are researched by the OA staff and re-submitted. If issues are corrected, the MA will provide the OA OBRA indicator code. All billings that were accepted by the MA from OA with the OBRA indicator code are eligible for federal financial participation. Federal financial claiming is submitted by MA. Payments are made by the State of Illinois Comptroller's Office from OA appropriation. The OA then submits the amount of expenditures for Medicaid eligible customers to the MA for submission of federal financial participation. MA's Claims Processing The OA Waiver claiming data are transmitted to the MA via a weekly computer tape exchange. The Waiver subsection of the MMIS matches the customer against the recipient eligibility file to ensure Medicaid eligibility on the date of service and verifies the provider is enrolled as a Waiver provider with the MA. The Waiver subsection includes edits for Waiver claims that conflict with other Waiver and hospital, nursing home, hospice facility, or ICF/IID claims and rejects Waiver claims that are duplicative or incompatible. MMIS includes edits for waiver claims that conflict with other waivers, hospitals, nursing home, hospice facilities, or institutional claims, and rejects waiver claims that are duplicative or incompatible. Federal matching funds are deposited into the State's General Revenue Fund. A small portion of the federal matching Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 272 of 302 12/16/2022funds is deposited into a dedicated fund to be used to fund community services for customers with developmental disabilities. The State was approved for a Good Faith Effort exemption request for the implementation of an open/hybrid model Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) on November 21, 2019. On June 3, 2021, the MA posted a Request for Proposal (RFP) to secure the open/hybrid model Electronic Visit Verification (EVV). The winning bidder has been selected. The state anticipates the EVV system will be operational by the end of calendar year 2022. This system will be used for the personal care services (PCS) and Home Health Care Services (HHCS) as defined in the 21st Century Cures Act. PCS are defined as Activities of Daily Living (ADL), such as movement, bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, and personal hygiene and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), such as meal preparation, money management, shopping, and telephone use. HHCS are defined as personal care services or home health care services requiring an in- home visit by a provider that are provided under a state plan or 1915c waiver. Customers have the choice to continue to use the current EVV system operated by the OA or change to the open/hybrid EVV model system that will be maintained by the MA. To ensure financial integrity and accountability, EVV will allow the state to monitor and reduce in unauthorized services, improve the quality of services to customers, and reduce fraud, waste and abuse. Appendix I: Financial Accountability I-2: Rates, Billing and Claims (2 of 3) Certifying Public Expenditures (select one) : No. state or local government agencies do not certify expenditures for waiver services. Yes. state or local government agencies directly expend funds for part or all of the cost of waiver services and certify their state government expenditures (CPE) in lieu of billing that amount to Medicaid. Select at least one : Certified Public Expenditures (CPE) of State Public Agencies. Specify: (a) the state government agency or agencies that certify public expenditures for waiver services; (b) how it is assured that the CPE is based on the total computable costs for waiver services; and, (c) how the state verifies that the certified public expenditures are eligible for Federal financial participation in accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7433.51(b). (Indicate source of revenue for CPEs in Item I-4-a.) Certified Public Expenditures (CPE) of Local Government Agencies. Specify: (a) the local government agencies that incur certified public expenditures for waiver services; (b) how it is assured that the CPE is based on total computable costs for waiver services; and, (c) how the state verifies that the certified public expenditures are eligible for Federal financial participation in accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7433.51(b). (Indicate source of revenue for CPEs in Item I-4-b.) c. Appendix I: Financial Accountability I-2: Rates, Billing and Claims (3 of 3) Billing Validation Process. Describe the process for validating provider billings to produce the claim for federal financial participation, including the mechanism(s) to assure that all claims for payment are made only: (a) when the individual was eligible for Medicaid waiver payment on the date of service; (b) when the service was included in the participant's d. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 273 of 302 12/16/2022approved service plan; and, (c) the services were provided: Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 274 of 302 12/16/2022Provider billings are validated by the OA to verify the effective date of each waiver service authorized in the customers PCP and the customer's level of care eligibility. Providers are required to certify billings are true and accurate through the ROCS billing system which transmits the billing information to the Community Reimbursement Subsystem (CRS). The CRS has edits in place which conduct checks to ensure the customer has Medicaid coverage on the date the service is provided and billed, and the customer is authorized to receive the service. Provider billings are validated by the OA to verify the effective date of the customer's eligibility and authorization for services according to the approved PCP. Customers also sign time sheets to verify that services were performed in accordance with the PCP. If inappropriate billing is discovered, the claim is adjusted or voided by the OA to reduce the state's claim for FFP. The OA will contact the provider to collect any overpayment. The OA will also void or adjust any claims related to the restitution. When inappropriate billings are identified, the OA either ensures the provider voids the billing or the OA voids the billing itself in the electronic payment system. This initiates a recoupment of overpayments. This action in turn automatically voids the claim for Federal Financial Participation. Paid claims are passed through to the MA and MMIS processing edits are initiated for Medicaid and waiver eligibility. Lastly, the MA performs post-payment personal plan and financial reviews. Oversight to ensure that appropriate services were provided occurs through the OA's computer system. The OA's computer system generates applicable rates and service authorizations according to the waiver program parameters for which the customer is authorized to participate. Each customer's service authorization(s) of which some are provider agency specific where only the specified provider can bill and receive payment and others are generic where any qualified and enrolled provider can bill and be paid are transmitted from the OA's computer system to the OA's Community Reimbursement Sub-system (CRS). The OA's computer system can either produce individualized or statewide rates as set by the OA's rate setting methodologies. The OA's computer system also transmits the individualized or statewide rates to the OA's (CRS) which maintains a complete historical record of every customer's authorization(s) for services and rates. CRS also contains each provider's eligibility to provide services and what services the provider is eligible to provide, bill and be paid for. Each provider or provider agency submits billing through the OA's Reporting of Community Services (ROCS) system. ROCS reporting from each provider or provider agency includes the customer's information of the first, last and middle initial of the customer's name, Social Security Number (SSN), Recipient Identification Number (RIN), and Date of Birth (DOB). The provider or provider agency also reports specific bill codes for each service delivered, quantity of services delivered and bill rate. All ROCS billing is transmitted to the CRS. The CRS batch processes all ROCS billing on a weekly basis. The CRS has edits which check for the customer's identity against the customer's information in CRS. The customer's Medicaid eligibility on the day services were delivered and being billed for, the customer is authorized for the service being billed and the service was authorized for the date service(s) are being billed. The CRS also compares the provider's billing rate against either the statewide billing rate or the customer's authorized individualized rate for the applicable service and bill code. The CRS adjudicates all provider billing based on the customer's eligibility for services on the date services were delivered by the provider or provider agency. The CRS performs edit checks that the provider or provider agency is eligible to deliver the service being billed. CRS also adjudicates the payment for services based on the OA's authorized rate for the customer for each service. CRS rejects and does not pay for any services which do not pass all of the above listed edits including services provided before or after a customer's service authorization for each service. Other edits ensure appropriate billing is submitted by the provider or provider agency include that the CRS reject billing for services prior to the customer's determined date of eligibility for DD services by the ISC. Another safeguard for all provider billings is that CRS will reject any billing if the billing was previously submitted, adjudicated and paid. Provider agencies cannot bill over the authorized number of units for a day or month of service nor can a provider or provider agency bill over the annually authorized number of units of any specific service for the customer. Provider claims are further validated by applying MMIS processing edits and by conducting OA post-payment reviews. See also Appendix I-1 for additional information on post-payment reviews. Through post-payment reviews, the OA, based on a representative sample of claims, confirms that services were in accordance with the PCP. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 275 of 302 12/16/2022Billing and Claims Record Maintenance Requirement. Records documenting the audit trail of adjudicated claims (including supporting documentation) are maintained by the Medicaid agency, the operating agency (if applicable), and providers of waiver services for a minimum period of 3 years as required in 45 CFR \u00a792.42.e. Appendix I: Financial Accountability I-3: Payment (1 of 7) Method of payments -- MMIS (select one ): Payments for all waiver services are made through an approved Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS). Payments for some, but not all, waiver services are made through an approved MMIS. Specify: (a) the waiver services that are not paid through an approved MMIS; (b) the process for making such payments and the entity that processes payments; (c) and how an audit trail is maintained for all state and federal funds expended outside the MMIS; and, (d) the basis for the draw of federal funds and claiming of these expenditures on the CMS-64: Payments for waiver services are not made through an approved MMIS. Specify: (a) the process by which payments are made and the entity that processes payments; (b) how and through which system(s) the payments are processed; (c) how an audit trail is maintained for all state and federal funds expended outside the MMIS; and, (d) the basis for the draw of federal funds and claiming of these expenditures on the CMS-64: Under an interagency agreement with the Medicaid Agency, the Operating Agency makes payments from a central computer system. Providers may bill the MA directly. On a weekly basis, Waiver claims are edited and sent to the Medicaid Agency for Medicaid claiming. The audit trail is established through State agency approved rates, person centered plan authorization, documentation of service delivery, and computerized payment and claiming systems cross-matched with the Medicaid Agency, MMIS system. The OA performs a post payment review, based on a statistically valid representative sample of waiver claims (with a 95% confidence level and a +/-5% margin of error). The post payment review looks at whether the services were specified in the person centered plan. The OA reviews a statistically valid representative sample of claims (with a 95% confidence level and a +/-5% margin of error) to determine whether the individual was eligible on the date of services. The OA reviews a statistically valid representative sample of claims (with a 95% confidence level and a +/-5% margin of error) of waiver claims to determine whether the rates paid are in accordance with the reimbursement methodology. The OA submits a quarterly report to the MA with their findings and remediation activities. The MA conducts a validation review based on the quarterly reports to verify that the OA followed their post payment review procedures and verifies that appropriate remediation actions were taken. Payments for waiver services are made by a managed care entity or entities. The managed care entity is paid a monthly capitated payment per eligible enrollee through an approved MMIS. Describe how payments are made to the managed care entity or entities: a. Appendix I: Financial Accountability for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 276 of 302 12/16/2022Direct payment. In addition to providing that the Medicaid agency makes payments directly to providers of waiver services, payments for waiver services are made utilizing one or more of the following arrangements ( select at least one ): The Medicaid agency makes payments directly and does not use a fiscal agent (comprehensive or limited) or a managed care entity or entities. The Medicaid agency pays providers through the same fiscal agent used for the rest of the Medicaid program. The Medicaid agency pays providers of some or all waiver services through the use of a limited fiscal agent. Specify the limited fiscal agent, the waiver services for which the limited fiscal agent makes payment, the functions that the limited fiscal agent performs in paying waiver claims, and the methods by which the Medicaid agency oversees the operations of the limited fiscal agent: Under an interagency agreement with the MA, the OA or a Financial Management Service (FMS) entity, as described in Appendix E, makes payments directly to providers of waiver services. The OA then sends electronic claims via computer tape based on the paid services to the MA for further adjudication and Federal Waiver reimbursement purposes. The limited fiscal agent is Avenues to Consumer Employer Services and $supports (ACES$) a function of the OA. Services paid through the FMS entity are limited to Personal Support Worker (PSW) services. ACES$ developed a payroll system for PSWs. The customer or their identified Employer of Record (EOR) must sign/approve timesheets to verify the hours worked. The timesheets are sent to ACES$ via mail, e-mail, fax or online portal. ACES$'s payroll system validates the submitted timesheets, confirms the PSW is authorized to provide services to the customer, ensures the hours worked are within the approved service authorization, and the appropriate rate is assigned. The ACES$ operated payroll system pays PSWs twice monthly. The payroll system withholds unemployment, FICA, and other deductions as requested by the PSW. The OA passes the detail expenditure data weekly to the MA. The MA is the single Statewide Medicaid claiming agency for the State of Illinois. The data is fed into the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) and is subject to edits to ensure the information provided is accurate and that the services/providers are eligible for federal match under Title XIX. Should any claims have inaccurate information, those claims are rejected by the system and a file of the rejected claims is passed back to the OA for their review. Claims that pass through the system without error filter down to the MARS reporting unit. The MARS unit is responsible for generating the reports to the Bureau of Federal Finance (BFF) who use the reports to claim Medicaid expenditure data quarterly on the CMS 64. MARS also has a series of edits and codes that are used to filter data to ensure accuracy and to determine to what program the expenditure should be reported. The BFF report the expenditures on the CMS 64 on a quarterly basis 30 days after the quarter ends. Federal Draws from the Medicaid Grant - In accordance with the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA), the BFF draws down federal monies from the Title XIX grant for the waiver on a weekly basis and deposits the funds into the General Revenue Fund (GRF). The amount to be drawn is an estimate derived by using historical expenditure data. Once the CMS 64 is completed at the end of the quarter, the BFF reconciles the estimated cash draw to the actual expenditures reported on the CMS 64. The reconciling expenditure amount is either added to or subtracted from the grant award depending on whether the adjustment is over or under the original estimated amount. Providers are paid by a managed care entity or entities for services that are included in the state's contract with the entity. Specify how providers are paid for the services (if any) not included in the state's contract with managed care entities. b.

Method for Excluding the Cost of Room and Board Furnished in Residential Settings. The following describes the methodology that the state uses to exclude Medicaid payment for room and board in residential settings: The OA sets individualized rates for a participant in a Residential Habilitation setting based on a rate methodology that is comprised of the following components: -Room and Board Component - reimburses community providers for keeping a home in normal operation. -Program Component - reimburses community providers for providing habilitation services and supports, including training, protective oversight, supervision and other assistance to customers with a developmental disability living in a residential setting. -Transportation Component - reimburses community providers for providing general transportation to and from community locations that are not day program sites or places where Medicaid State Plan services are delivered. -Administration Component - reimburses community providers for general staff supervision and overhead related to the delivery of residential supports. -Individual Supports Component - reimburses community providers for supports that are specific to a customer's needs that are not covered elsewhere. The OA determines waiver claims for Residential Habilitation services based on the Program, Transportation, Administration, and Individual Supports components of the rates. The Room and Board Component is excluded when calculating waiver claims. b.

Yes. Per 42 CFR \u00a7441.310(a)(2)(ii), the state will claim FFP for the additional costs of rent and food that can be reasonably attributed to an unrelated live-in personal caregiver who resides in the same household as the waiver participant. The state describes its coverage of live-in caregiver in Appendix C-3 and the costs attributable to rent and food for the live-in caregiver are reflected separately in the computation of factor D (cost of waiver services) in Appendix J. FFP for rent and food for a live-in caregiver will not be claimed when the participant lives in the caregiver's home or in a residence that is owned or leased by the provider of Medicaid services. The following is an explanation of: (a) the method used to apportion the additional costs of rent and food attributable to the unrelated live-in personal caregiver that are incurred by the individual served on the waiver and (b) the method used to reimburse these costs: Appendix I: Financial Accountability I-7: Participant Co-Payments for Waiver Services and Other Cost Sharing (1 of 5) Co-Payment Requirements.

Describe the basis of the estimate of the average length of stay on the waiver by participants in item J-2-a. The average length of stay (ALOS) has been projected based upon enrollment data in MMIS during state fiscal years 2016 through 2020 and projected phase-in and phase-out projections. The calculation for ALOS for each waiver year is determined by dividing the number of days for customers on the waiver by the unduplicated customer count (8,395,770/24,500). The phase-in and phase-out projections are in Attachment #1 of Appendix B-3-d. b. Appendix J: Cost Neutrality Demonstration J-2: Derivation of Estimates (3 of 9) Derivation of Estimates for Each Factor. Provide a narrative description for the derivation of the estimates of the following factors. Factor D Derivation. The estimates of Factor D for each waiver year are located in Item J-2-d. The basis and methodology for these estimates is as follows: i. c. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 285 of 302 12/16/2022Factor D for the five year waiver cycle was projected in the following manner: Unduplicated customers for each waiver service: IL.0350.R5.00\u2014Renewal 7/1/2022 The percent of total unduplicated customers receiving each waiver service was based upon paid claims in MMIS during state fiscal years 2016 through 2020. Factor D was calculated by counting the number of unique customers in MMIS enrolled in the waiver from January 2017 through September 2021 and projected all the renewal waiver years based on observed historical levels. Additionally, overall growth assumptions based on historical experience for customers moving on and off the waiver. The noted variance occurs because we round the number of customers to the nearest integer. For services with low utilization, rounding can have a noticeable impact on effective trend. IL.0350.R5.01\u2014Amendment 1/1/2023 For Residential Habilitation, the estimate for WY 1 Unduplicated customers was developed by using current approved and/or placed rates as of June 30, 2022 (11,086 rates approved) according to the DHS website https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=145602. An 11.2% increase was applied to reflect a proportional increase for WY 1 unduplicated participants. Residential Habilitations users were increased proportionally for WY 2 - WY 5. For all other services, the assumption and methodology are consistent with the waiver renewal (IL.0350.R5.00) except that we assumed a minimum of 10 users for each service in order to avoid the need for an amendment in the future should the number of users change by an amount that would have an immaterial impact to the total cost of waiver services. When an assumed number of users of a service is a percentage of unduplicated recipients, the number of users of a service increases proportionally with the number of unduplicated recipients. Average units per customer: IL.0350.R5.00\u2014Renewal 7/1/2022 The average units per customer for each waiver service in waiver year 1 is based upon paid claims in MMIS during state fiscal years 2016 through 2020. The average units per customer for waiver years 2 through 5 were calculated by multiplying the prior year average units per customer by the change in ALOS between waiver years. As the ALOS is projected to be unchanged for each of the waiver years, the average units per customer remain unchanged. Residential Habilitation contains four procedure code combinations. Each is counted \"Per Day\", but customers with intensive needs are using two of these in a day. IL.0350.R5.01\u2014Amendment 1/1/2023 Changes were made to the average units per user for the Residential Habilitation service. The Residential Habilitation waiver category contains 24-Hour CILA, which is billed daily, and Intermittent CILA, which is billed hourly. We assumed the average units per user based on claims in MMIS for SFY 2018 and SFY 2019 for these two services. Waiver Year 2 includes an extra day because of a leap year. Average cost per unit: IL.0350.R5.00\u2014Renewal 7/1/2022 The average cost per unit is based on the current fee schedules for Adult Day Service, Community Day Service, Self-Direction Assistance, Temporary Assistance, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Speech Therapy, Skilled Nursing, Training and Counseling Services for Unpaid Caregivers services. Cost per unit for Behavior Intervention and Treatment and Behavioral Services (Psychotherapy and Counseling) are based upon the statewide benchmark rates published in the Developmental Disability Services Guidehouse Rate Study, dated November 30, 2020. Cost per unit for other services are based upon paid claims in MMIS during state fiscal years 2016 through 2020. IL.0350.R5.01\u2014Amendment 1/1/2023 The average cost per unit was updated for 24 Hour Stabilization Services, Adult Day Service (ADS), Emergency Home Response Services (EHRS), Self-Direction Assistance, Occupational Therapy (OT), Physical Therapy (PT), Speech Therapy (ST), Skilled Nursing, Supported Employment - Individual Employment Support (SEI), and Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 286 of 302 12/16/2022Supported Employment - Small Group Support (SEG) based upon reimbursement changes effective in 1/1/2023. WY 1 estimates were developed by weighting estimates with January 2023 rate increases using projected enrollment. For WY 2 through WY 5, we maintained the same cost per unit trend assumptions. As stated previously, Residential Habilitation is a composite of 24-Hour CILA and Intermittent CILA. Estimates for the total WY 1 Residential Habilitation expenditures were developed by using claims in MMIS for SFY 2018 and SFY 2019 for these two services and divided by the average units per user to develop an average cost per service. The Community Day Service waiver service includes On Site, Off Site, and Enhanced Residential sub-services. In the waiver renewal (IL.0350.R5.00), Enhanced Residential utilizers were mistakenly excluded from the composite Community Day Service calculation. For this amendment (IL.0350.R5.01), we assumed 2,000 of the Community Day Service utilizers received the Enhanced Residential service and allocated the remaining users as 60% On Site and 40% Off Site. The WY 1 composite average cost per unit was developed by blending the revised first half of WY 1 composite with the new second half of WY1 composite. For WY 2 through WY 5, we maintained the same cost per unit trend assumptions as the waiver renewal (IL.0350.R5.00). Factor D' Derivation. The estimates of Factor D' for each waiver year are included in Item J-1. The basis of these estimates is as follows: Estimates for Factor D' are based upon paid claims in MMIS during state fiscal years 2016 through 2020 and was trended to increase at a rate of approximately 3% per year. State fiscal year 2020 Factor D' spending per capita, as reported in the SFY 2020 372 report, were summarized for non-waiver services provided during the waiver year to individuals enrolled in the waiver. Future waiver years were projected based on the trends observed in the 372 reports for SFY2017 - SFY 2020. Factor D' and Factor G' were developed by reviewing SFY 2018 - SFY 2020 historical experience and developing trend rates. We have observed higher historical trends for the institutional population, and we applied a 5.5% annual trend to G' services and a 3.0% annual trend to D' services. Population mix differences (e.g. dual- eligible vs. Medicaid only, managed care vs FFS) have a significant influence on observed Prime trend rates. ii. Factor G Derivation. The estimates of Factor G for each waiver year are included in Item J-1. The basis of these estimates is as follows: Estimates for Factor G are based upon paid claims in MMIS during state fiscal years 2018 through 2020 for fee- for-service institutional customers ages 18 and older with a comparable level of care and was trended to increase at a rate of approximately 6.5% per year. Factor G spending per capita, using FFS claims for institutional customers ages 18 and older with a comparable level of care were summarized for each historical waiver year SFY 2018 through SFY 2020. A 6.5% annual trend was selected based upon the annual per capita institutional cost for the period of SFYs 2016 through 2020. Factor G for each projected waiver year is this expenditure value, divided by the number of unduplicated customers with a non-zero intermediate care facility expenditures. iii. Factor G' Derivation. The estimates of Factor G' for each waiver year are included in Item J-1. The basis of these estimates is as follows: iv. Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver: IL.0350.R05.01 - Jan 01, 2023 (as of Jan 01, 2023) Page 287 of 302 12/16/2022Estimates for Factor G' are based upon paid claims in MMIS during state fiscal years 2018 through 2020 for fee- for-service institutional customers ages 18 and older with a comparable level of care and was trended to increase at a rate of approximately 5.5% per year. Factor G' spending per capita, using FFS claims experience for institutional customers ages 18 and older with a comparable level of care were summarized for each historical waiver year SFY 2018 through SFY 2020. A 5.5% annual trend was selected based upon the annual per capita non-institutional cost for state fiscal years 2018 through 2020. Future waiver years were projected on Factor G' expenditure per unduplicated customer trend from state fiscal years 2016-2020. Factor G' is all such allowable non-waiver related expenditures divided by the number of unique customers during the waiver year.
