The survey results underscore the importance of an ACIP preferential recommendation and come as the ACIP evaluat es data to provide guidance for flu vaccines in this vulnerable population. Influenza can lead to life -threatening complications, including pneumonia and serious heart conditions, especially in older adults.2 Recent estimates showed that 70 -85% of flu -related deaths and 50 -70% flu -related hospitalizations occurred in adults 65 +.3 However, ACIP recommendations for influenza vaccines for that population have not changed since 2010 and currently, the ACIP does not provide preferential vaccine recommendations for these patients.4 The 65+ Flu Vaccines HCP Preference Survey was designed to evaluate HCP influenza vaccine brand preference for three different influenza vaccines. When presented with blinded clinical profiles of the three vaccines, nearly 7 4% of HCPs said they would recommend a vaccine with the clinical profile of Fluzone\u00ae High-Dose Quadrivalent for patients 65+ over another flu vaccine designed for this population, or over a standard -dose influenza vaccine.1 Other key takeaways from the s urvey included: 76% of HCPs would recommend a vaccine with the clinical profile of Fluzone High -Dose Quadrivalent for their family and friends, if over 65 +.1 72% of HCPs would prefer a vaccine with the clinical profile of Fluzone High -Dose Quadrivalent for themselves, if over 65+.1 96% of HCPs a re very or somewhat likely to follow ACIP guidance when vaccinating adults 65+ for seasonal flu .1 Michael Greenberg, MD North America Medical Head of Vaccines at Sanofi \"Given the importance of protecting this vulnerable population from the flu, this new survey underscores the need for clear and specific guidance , ideally with a recommendation for Fluzone High - Dose Quadrivalent, based on demonstrated clinical results and real -world evidence. In fact, most healthcare professionals surveye d said they would prefer a vaccine with the clinical profile of Fluzone High -Dose Quadrivalent for themselves, their family and friends.1 This guidance could help to improve patient and provider confidence, patient outcomes, and access for patients to the recommended 2/4 MAT -US-2204207 -v1.0-06/2022 vaccine. It's important for ACIP guidance to follow the science, especially for older adults who suffer the greatest burden from seasonal flu.\" With protection against four flu strains, Fluzone High -Dose is the only influenza vaccine licensed for use in adults 65 years of age and older to have demonstrated superior efficacy in a randomized controlled trial versus a standard dose influenza vaccine for the prevention of laboratory -confirmed influenza illness and the only influenza vaccin e with 10 years of data demonstrating protection from flu and its related complications.5,6 a,b In a meta -analysis of 15 published reports, including approximately 34 million people, those who received Fluzone High - Dose experienced approximately an 18% red uction in cardiorespiratory hospitalizations and over a 27% decrease in pneumonia hospitalizations, both of which are reductions above what the standard dose vaccines provided.6 a Proven superiority in a clinical trial between Fluzone High -Dose (Influenza Vaccine) (trivalent formulation) and a standard -dose influenza vaccine5 b Includes 10 years of evidence (2009 -2019) with Fluzone High -Dose (trivalent formulation)6 About the 65+ Flu Vaccines Healthcare Professional Preference S urvey The 65+ Flu Vaccines HCP Preference S urvey was conducted online among 700 licensed primary care physicians, pharma cists, cardiologists and pulmonologists within the United States by Ipsos , the world's third -largest insights and analytics company , on behalf of Sanofi from March 9 to 23, 2022. The survey was designed to evaluate HCP influenza vaccine preference between three different influenza vaccine options in a blinded format (Fluzone High -Dose Quadrivalent , , Adjuvanted )). The sample size, the range of demographics, and practice type suggest that the results are relevant of the flu administering population. The 65+ HCP Prefere nce Survey was reviewed and approved by independent review board (IRB) Salus , an AAHRP -accredited IRB. This survey was not designed to compare the efficacy and safety of the three vaccines used in this survey. There are no head -to-head clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of the three vaccines used in this survey. While survey participation was voluntary, respondents were compensated within industry standards for their time and were not informed of the survey's sponsor. About Fluzone High -Dose Quadrivalent Fluzone High -Dose Quadrivalent is a vaccine indicated for prevention of influenza disease caused by influenza A and B strains contained in the vaccine. Fluzone High -Dose Quadrivalent is given to people 65 years of age and older .5 Fluzone High -Dose is the only vaccine approved by the U.S. FDA for superior flu protection in adults 65 years of age and older, compared to a standard -dose flu vaccine.5 With 4 -strain protection, Fluzone High -Dose Quadrivalent builds on the legacy of the trivalent formulation, which was clinically proven to be 24.2% more effective at preventing flu th an standard -dose Fluzone (Influenza Vaccine) in adults 65+.7 Based on data from Fluzone High -Dose (Influenza Vaccine), side effects were slightly more frequent after vaccination with Fluzone High -Dose compared to a standard -dose vaccine.8 In addition, Fluzone High -Dose has demonstrated protection against influenza and its related complications including pneumonia -, and cardiorespiratory - hospitalizations .6 The efficacy of trivalent formulation is relevant to Fluzone High -Dose Quadrivalent s ince both products are manufactured according to the same process and have overlapping compositions.5 Outside of the U.S., Sanofi's High -Dose influenza vaccine has also earned recommendations for use over standard -dose influenza vaccine in individual adul ts 65 years and older by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) in Canada , along with a recommendation for priority use in older adults by Germany's Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) .9,10 Important Safety Information Fluzone High -Dose Quadrivalent should not be given to anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine, including eggs or egg products, or after previous dose of any influenza vaccine. 3/4 MAT -US-2204207 -v1.0-06/2022 Tell your he alth care provider if you have ever had Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (severe muscle weakness) after a previous influenza vaccination. If Fluzone High -Dose Quadrivalent is given to people with a compromised immune system, including those receiving therapies that suppress the immune system, the immune response may be lower than expected. Vaccination with Fluzone High -Dose Quadrivalent may not protect all people who receive the vaccine. For Fluzone High -Dose Quadrivalent, in adults 65 years of age and older, the m ost common side effects were pain, redness, and/or swelling where you got the shot; muscle ache, headache, and general discomfort. Other side effects may occur. Please see the Prescribing Information , including Patient Information Sheet .
