You need male hormone therapy Hormone replacement therapy is not just for women. Men can also gradually experience loss of hormones, mainly testosterone. It is called andropause and is more commonly known as \"male menopause.\" We see men as young as 30 with symptoms of andropause. Some of the symptoms are decreased sex drive, reduced sex performance, fatigue, decreased stamina, weight gain. More subtle symptoms include bone and cardiovascular dysfunctions and increased cholesterol levels. At My Path we treat hormones naturally, working with compounding pharmacies to customize treatments for each individual patient. You are looking for women's health Women experience large shifts in hormonal levels before, during and after menopause. At My Path Medical we treat this group of patients by carefully balancing their estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and adrenal and thyroid glands. We use only natural or bio-identical hormones, rather than hormones derived from horse urine (Premarin), that differs greatly from human hormones. Hormone replacement therapy is not just for women.
