Multimedia, USA [Page elcome to 1eneva The 1996 Conference announced 'One World, One Hope' - the hope of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART). The optimism of Vancouver, which so affected the world's media, was, however, always tinged by scepticism and sadness - many commented that in fact there were 'Many Worlds, but only One with Hope'. For the 12th World AIDS Conference, we chose the slogan 'Bridging the Gap'. We hope to be a bridge between the optimism of HAART proclaimed two years ago, and the immense scale of the pandemic, which will be the focus in Durban in 2000 - the first World AIDS Conference to take place in the South. As we planned this Conference, we were always conscious of the need to reflect the gritty realities of living with AIDS, especially in communities struggling with seriously limited resources. We explicitly address NorthSouth concerns throughout the programme, as well as presenting the results of excellent clinical trials and bench science. In addition, we have established 'The Geneva Principle', which attempts to bridge the gap between Science and Community by involving both in all aspects of Conference planning. Leading scientists have, of course, had pre-eminent responsibility for planning the scientific aspects of the programme, and they have worked with people living with HIV and AIDS and other members of the community, many of whom are also scientifically trained. In turn, those planning the community aspects have been supported by scientists, and recognise how many scientists are themselves deeply affected by the pandemic at a personal level. This is the first World AIDS Conference where researchers have been permitted to submit two abstracts as lead author, and we have received a record 7,100 abstracts. Along with the abstract sessions, we have developed other components of the programme. Non-abstract driven sessions involve a series of invited speakers or bring together a panel of experts to debate, discuss and reflect on cutting-edge questions, often addressing the theme of 'Bridging the Gap' and building links between science, policy and community. We have also asked some of the plenary presenters to develop their talks in an innovative way, sharing the talk with a colleague from another region of the world, thus bridging the gap before they even arrive here. In addition, Community Symposia will bring a lively, experiential perspective to questions that may also be treated in an academic context elsewhere at the Conference. There are four pathways cutting across the programme: Gender, Policy, Youth and Children, and Human Rights. We believe these topics incorporate many current concerns. We gladly dropped 'North-South' issues from consideration as a pathway. When the programme was finalised, we realised that so many sessions addressed concerns in both resource-rich and -poor areas of the world that this would have been a highway, embracing most of the Conference. The pathway on youth and children includes several sessions addressing the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. The prevention of transmission to babies can be achieved with several relatively low-cost interventions. It is particularly appropriate that it should figure prominently in a conference with the slogan of 'Bridging the Gap'. The pathway on policy is a consequence of a change in Tracks C and D. At previous Conferences, policy was one of the areas covered by Track D. For this meeting, we have sought to sharpen the distinction between Tracks C and D, and to acknowledge the important policy considerations in basic and clinical science, as well as those more usually addressed by social scientists. Both scientists and community representatives have been encouraged to apply for scholarships, and we received an overwhelming 3,600 applications - nearly double the number applying to the last conference. We have further developed Vancouver's rigorous selection procedure, and have dedicated 2 million Swiss Francs to this initiative. Approximately 10% of delegates will be attending the Conference as part of the Scholarship Programme. We hope that they, alongside regular delegates, will enjoy the extensive Skills Building Programme provided in English, French and Spanish. With so much on offer, please do take the opportunity to enjoy our extensive Cultural Programme: spend some peaceful time in the quiet room, visit the quilt display, the art exhibits and concerts or simply take a walk by the lake. We hope you have an enjoyable and productive week, and that what you learn here will help to bridge the gap between your work to date and the future directions you will take. Bernard Hirschel CONFERENCE CHAIR Gorna COMMUNITY PLANNING COMMITTEE CHAIR 12th World AIDS Conference Geneva [Page 3](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0140.071/5) SCIENTIFIC ASPECTS The 12th World AIDS Conference programme is organised into four distinct tracks, covering a wide range of HIV/AIDS-related issues from basic and clinical science through care, epidemiology, prevention and public health to social and behavioural sciences. Policy implications and community perspectives thread throughout all four tracks, building bridges between scientific advances and the daily realities confronted both by people living with HIV and AIDS and their communities from different regions around the globe. Tracks STrack A Basic Science Track A covers basic or laboratory research topics such as virology, animal models, vaccine research, immunology and microbiology. A Track B Clinical Science and Care Track B focuses on clinical research and care including antiretrovirals, gene therapy, preventive measures for opportunistic infections (OIs), treatments for OIs and cancers, nursing and palliative care. Track C Epidemiology, Prevention and Public Health Track C covers research about HIV incidence, prevalence and natural history; the demographics and determinants of HIV transmission and risk factors; technological and behavioural prevention interventions; and public health strategies. Track D Social and Behavioural Science Track D includes research from a broad range of social and behavioural sciences such as economics, political studies, law and ethics, human rights, development studies, human sexuality, anthropology, psychology and sociology. COMMUNITY ASPECTS The community aspects of the Conference have been designed to complement and support the scientific aspects. They include the Community Rendez-Vous, Orientation Sessions, Community Symposia, Skills Building Sessions, the Community Village, Socio-Cultural Outreach, the Electronic Talking Tree and the Scholarship Programme. 'Community' has been defined broadly for the purposes of this Conference. It includes scientists, health professionals, educators, counsellors, health promotion practitioners, community activists, and people living with HIV/AIDS. The primary focus of the community aspects of the 12th World AIDS Conference is on those people who represent community-based non-governmental organisations. CONFERENCE TERMS The programme format will be familiar to many participants, although it has been developed to ensure that substantial attention is given to 'bridging the gap' between North and South, science and community, and that crosstrack and inter-disciplinary issues are addressed. The main session types, along with other concepts you will encounter during the Conference, are outlined below: Bridging Sessions Bridging sessions are expected to appeal to a broad spectrum of participants. They are usually interdisciplinary and inter-sectoral. Their specific format varies, but they are designed to forge links between science and community, between bio-medical science and social and behavioural science, and between different regions of the world. They also address a range of policy, ethical and resource considerations with respect to the chosen topics. CDs (Compact Disks) On registering, delegates have the option to receive the official Conference Record (all the accepted abstracts) either on CD or in print. (A charge applies if both versions are requested.) These can be collected on-site at the delegate bag distribution area on presentation of the appropriate ticket. Closing Ritual On Thursday July 2 at 21.00, a ritual evening of traditional Swiss and African music will take place at Lake Geneva by the Restaurant La Perle du Lac. Community Liaison Network The Community Liaison Network (CLN) has provided us with a means of using key contacts, electronic networking and newsletters to share information about the Conference with the HIV/AIDS community around the globe. As a result, we have received global input to the Community Planning Committee and the Community Rendez-Vous. In addition, we have been able to spread information world-wide about the development of community and other Conference aspects, and to create a structure that will enable post-Conference continuity in the maintenance of networks created or strengthened in the Conference process. The CLN has functioned in three key ways, firstly through the publication of a quarterly newsletter, Le Pont, CONFERENCE WORKBOOK [Page 4](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0140.071/6) keeping the Community informed of the Conference process and of developments in issues programmed for the Conference. Secondly, the CLN has welcomed the input of a number of Key Correspondents - sub-regional representatives mandated to gather and disseminate information on the Conference. Thirdly, an electronic mail network (CLN-Electronic: accessed through our web site www.aids98.ch) provided the Conference with a discussion forum for on-going information exchange and debate, which in turn fed into the Community RendezVous Networking Sessions and other sessions on a number of emerging issues. Community Rendez-Vous The Community Rendez-Vous will facilitate community exchange and skills development, beginning Friday, June 26 in the evening with a retrospective Vancouver 1996 and a Community Reception. Saturday, June 27 is planned as a full day including regional, sub-regional and targeted community-specific meetings (organised in co-operation with existing and emerging networks). A plenary summary session including community resolutions is scheduled for the evening of Thursday, July 2. Scholarship delegates can pre-register for the Community Rendez-Vous. Others may register on site on Friday, June 26. Registration is limited to 200 per region. Community Rendez-Vous Schedule Friday, June 26 16.30-18.30 Friday, June 26 19.30-21.30 Saturday, June 27 09.00-12.00 Saturday, June 27 13.00-17.00 Thursday, July 2 18.30-20.00 Thursday, July 2 21.00-22.30 Opening Plenary Session Hall I Community Reception Palais Eynard, Geneva Regional Meetings/ Skills Building Workshops Session Halls I and II and Rooms D, E, F, G, H, I and K Network Meetings Session Halls I and II and Rooms D, E and F Closing Plenary Session Hall I Closing Ritual Perle du Lac The Electronic Talking Tree is a network of computer workstations grouped at the base of a number of real trees placed throughout the Conference venue. At these easy-tofind points, delegates can use the electronic message service and look through the Conference programme to identify key information using the Abstracts-on-Site facility. Late Breaker Sessions Because the deadline for abstract submission was several months prior to the Conference, there will be an opportunity for the presentation of abstracts highlighting important 'late breaking' developments in scientific research. These will be presented on Monday, June 29 (11.00-12.30: mother-to-child HIV transmission) and the morning of Friday, July 3. Non-Abstract Driven Sessions Non-abstract driven sessions, including track-specific symposia on certain topics, form a key part of the programme, with state-of-the-art presentations by leading authorities in the field. The number and times of track symposia differ from track to track, and some are partly abstract-driven and/or involve invited speakers making presentations with a moderator. Oral Abstract Sessions The main body of the 12th World AIDS Conference is composed of oral abstract presentations of track-specific peer-reviewed research. Questions from the audience will be encouraged and facilitated by the session chairs. Note: Oral abstract presentations will also be presented as posters Monday to Thursday (see page 5). Orientation Sessions Participants, especially newcomers to world AIDS conferences, will be pleased to find practical information (with regard to the Conference programme, venue and terminology) offered in one-hour sessions at regular intervals during Sunday, June 28. Although the official language of the Conference is English, orientation sessions will also be offered in French and Spanish. Orientation Session Schedule Sunday, June 28 10.00-11.00 Sessions in English 11.30-12.30 Session Hall I 13.00-14.00 14.30-15.30 de orientacin (en espatiol) 14.30-15,.30 Session Hall II Overflow Areas A limited number of over-subscribed sesssions will be broadcast by closed circuit television to overflow areas located in Session Hall IV (Community Village), the Conference Centre lobby, and Session Hall VII. Community Symposia Community Symposia have been organised for the late afternoons of Monday 29, Tuesday 30 and Wednesday 1. These will deal with a range of different issues related to community action and HIV/AIDS. The focus will be on interactive exchange including case studies, demonstrations, round table discussions, and workshops. Community Village The Community Village is situated at the heart of the Conference. It has been designed to include NGO booths, an amalgam of Swiss organisations, areas to facilitate dialogue and exchange, a platform for public presentations, and the central Electronic Talking Tree (http://www.aids98.ch). 4 12th World AIDS Conference Geneva [Page 5](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0140.071/7) Pathways At the 12th World AIDS Conference, many sessions will be taking place simultaneously. To help participants prioritise and plan their programme effectively, four pathways have been identified. These indicate topical issues that cut across the different tracks. 0 Gender This pathway brings together sessions of interest related to gender, including women, men and transgendered people. O Human Rights HIV impacts upon many basic human rights. Appropriate responses to human rights in relation to HIV will be explored as well as violations. 0 Policy Policy issues at local, national, regional and global level are the focus of this pathway. In previous Conferences, policy had been the focus of Track D, but now cuts across all tracks. 0 Youth and Children This pathway focuses on the impact of HIV on young people, including those living with HIV, and explores education initiatives directed at these communities. It also highlights breaking news and policy implications of approaches to preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission. Plenary Sessions Plenary sessions (designed for all participants) begin each Conference day. These sessions are each devoted to a specific topic/issue and include presentations that cut across the disciplines represented in the four Conference tracks. There will be simultaneous interpretation of these sessions from English into French and Spanish. Posters Research results will be presented in the form of posters, organised by track. These are generated from peerreviewed abstracts, which cover a wide variety of research topics. Posters will be displayed from 08.00 until 18.00 from Monday, June 29 to Thursday, July 2, with a daily change. Discussants will be at their posters from 08.00-08.50, 12.00-13.00 and 17.00-18.00 to answer questions; they will be identified with a large 'D' on their badge. Scholarship Programme Funded largely through the generous support of a number of sponsors, the Scholarship Programme has enabled us to fulfil our commitment to making the Conference accessible to people living with or working in the field of HIV and AIDS, particularly those from resource-poor environments. Approximately 1,000 people from developing countries, newly independent states, NGOs and marginalised communities have been awarded financial assistance. CONFERENCE WORKBOOK 5 [Page 6](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0140.071/8) Skills Building Workshops The Skills Building Programme concentrates on capacity building. Approximately 40 workshops are offered in five key content areas: prevention strategies, programme and organisational development, care and treatment of HIV, policy and advocacy, and information and communication technology. A main focus of these sessions is on training people to transfer the skills and knowledge gained at the Conference into their own communities. Summary Sessions On the mornings of Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, June 30 to July 2, summary sessions will be given. Designed primarily for delegates unfamiliar with technical terms, these will summarise key presentations of the previous day in each track and will be presented in jargonfree language. Simultaneous interpretation in French and Spanish will be provided. KEY CONFERENCE EVENTS Opening Ceremony The Opening Ceremony will take place in the Arena on Sunday June 28 between 17.30 and 19.00. The Conference co-organisers have prepared a short orientation video for the start of the Ceremony, which will serve to familiarise participants with the Conference programme and with their surroundings. After the video, a special message from five young people representing different regions of the globe, and distinguished speakers from the political arena, will set the tone for the days to come. Welcoming Reception Immediately following the Opening Ceremony, delegates will be invited to gather in Hall 7 for a cocktail reception. Note: Registered participants and accompanying persons, exhibitors, and media representatives are welcome to attend both the Opening Ceremony and the Welcoming Reception. Rapporteurs Session and Closing Ceremony Beginning at 11.00 on Friday July 3 in the Arena, five rapporteurs will provide a final overview for each track and for the community aspects of the programme. These summaries will focus on critical issues addressed and implications for future work.There will be simultaneous translation into French and Spanish. The Rapporteur session will be concluded by a special closing address which will bridge the gap to the XIIIth International AIDS Conference, to be held in Durban, South Africa, in 2000. The Conference will be brought to a close with a speech by the Chair of the Durban Conference. Note: Registered participants and accompanying persons, exhibitors, and media representatives are all welcome. CULTURAL PROGRAMME HIGHLIGHTS To enhance and complement the official programme of the 12th World AIDS Conference, a broad spectrum of cultural activities inside Palexpo and around Geneva has been planned in order for artists to perfom and exhibit their work. The primary goal of the Cultural Programme is to 'bridge the gap' between participants and the citizens of Geneva through the examination of the role of diverse cultural expressions in the face of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Art has a vital part to play in prevention, awareness raising and in mourning. Amidst the turmoil of such a large Conference, the Cultural Programme is designed to bring people together, and to give participants a space in which to breathe and to interact. In restful environments, the Cultural Programme presents examples of performance and visual arts used imaginatively to educate and to challenge. Most of the performances and exhibitions will take place in Hall 2, the cultural space at Palexpo. This hall is also open to the Geneva public. A warm invitation is extended to participants to visit Hall 2 to explore the contribution of artists to AIDS, to meet other people in a different setting or simply to relax. Some key socio-cultural activity highlights are listed below. More details are available to delegates on site. A Cultural Programme booth in the Community Village will inform participants of daily activities. All socio-cultural events are listed on the Conference's web site. AIDS and the Performing Arts Each Conference day, in different spaces at Palexpo, artists will present live performances of imaginative uses of theatre and other performance arts. They represent innovative tools to sensitise different sectors of societies about AIDS-related issues. Pascale Marthine Tayou from Cameroon, DramAidE and the Puppets against AIDS from South Africa, Bandhu Social Welfare Society from Dhakar, Bangladesh, and Komol Gandhar from India are among the artists you will discover. Dialogai (a Swiss organisation for gay people) will also present live performances in Palexpo and in Geneva throughout the Conference. AIDS and Visual Arts * 'Aujourd'hui pour demain', a Geneva-based group dedicated to art and AIDS, presents the works of international artists especially created for the Conference. * An exhibit of works by artists from around the globe, 'World of AIDS: Between Resignation and Hope', commissioned by the Swiss AIDS Documentation Centre, can be seen in the Centre for Contemporary in the Art and Dialogai office in Geneva from May to September. Conference delegates are invited for a cocktail on Wednesday July 1 at 18.00. * An exhibition of paintings entitled 'Traces de Vie' by Daniel Gonthier, a Geneva artist lost to AIDS, can be seen at the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum from May to September. * 'AIDS and Stamps' (a display of stamps for HIV prevention from more than 100 countries) is presented by the Philatelic Museum of the UN. 12th World AIDS Conference Geneva [Page 7](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0140.071/9) AIDS and Popular Art 'From Slogans to T-shirts', a unique exhibition of hundreds of AIDS T-shirts from around the globe, is on display in Hall 2. AIDS and Cinema A festival ofAIDS-related films is showing in the Centre for Cinematographic Arts in the Maison du Grutli in Geneva. Quilt Ceremony Delegates are invited to attend a commemorative ceremony of the Names Project Quilt on Saturday June 27 at 16.00 on the Pont des Bergues, which is located at the heart of Geneva. Approximately 100 quilts from the European Rainbow Quilt Tour and the Swiss Quilt Chapter will be displayed in the city and can be viewed afterwards in the cultural space (Hall 2) at Palexpo during the Conference. Interfaith Ceremony An interfaith service of remembrance, hope and healing will take place on the evening of Wednesday July 1 at 20.00 at the Cathedral Saint Pierre, located in Geneva's old town. Other Interesting Socio-Cultural Events In and Around Geneva * Come along to a free music festival, 'AMR aux Cropettes', in the Parc des Cropettes near the downtown train station up to Sunday June 28 * Every evening, delegates can enjoy free public viewing of the France '98 World Cup Football in one of Geneva's most beautiful spots, Les Bains des Paquis * Join 'Le Bal du Bitume', a dance party arranged by Aspasie (a local organisation working with sex workers) on Tuesday June 30 at the Palladium * 'What's Love', a dance party and fashion show with performances has been arranged for Saturday June 27 at the Salle de Plainpalais * An exhibition 'Corps i Vif', focusing on art and anatomy, can be seen at the Musee d'Art et d'Histoire * The internationally-renowned Montreux Jazz Festival begins on Friday July 3 * PRIDE 98 'Lesbian and Gay Pride and Friends' will take place in Lausanne on Saturday July 4 * Join a dance party on Saturday June 27 at the Ancien Palais des Expositions arranged by 3600 Fever (a Geneva-based organisation for gay people).

CONFERENCE WORKBOOK [Page 8](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0140.071/10) SCORING AND SELECTION OF ABSTRACTS More than 7,000 abstracts were received by the February 2nd deadline. The Geneva Secretariat developed procedures to ensure fair, objective and regionally balanced selection: A reviewer file was established by writing to experts who had reviewed abstracts for the previous conference. To this list were added first and last authors of articles published in the journal AIDS during 1997, and names based on recommendations of members of the scientific and community programme committees. Potential reviewers were contacted in October 1997 and asked to indicate their subjects of expertise. The final file comprised approximately 930 names. Abstracts were classified according to subject. Each abstract was sent to five reviewers with expertise in the relevant area. Authors' names and affiliations were removed. Reviewers scored each abstract as to design and methods, presentation and interpretation, and importance to the Conference. The scores were read by machine, and collated and averaged by computer. Double weight was accorded to grade three (importance). The abstracts were classified according to their region of origin: Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and all other countries. The percentage originating from each region was determined. All selections were done in such a way that abstracts from each region had an equal chance of acceptance. This means that the cut-off grades were different in each region, i.e. higher in the 'rest-of-the-world' countries than in developing countries. From the total number of abstracts received, 5,000 were accepted as posters, and an additional 1,000 were accepted for printing only in the Conference Record. Of the 800 selected as candidates for oral presentation, roughly 400 were finally chosen during a three-day meeting in March. During May and June, poster 'no-shows' were replaced by print-only abstracts or rejected abstracted where the low grade was considered controversial. Friday,June 26 The Community Rendez-Vous will be a forum for community exchange and skills development.The focus will be on discussing mechanisms for improving networking on five themes (human rights, migration, community-based research, sex work, and living with AIDS). Small rooms are available for breakouts and other networks. Limited registration will be available on-site on Friday.There will be a Treatment and Science Workshop all day on Saturday and Sunday in the Swissair Centre.

Carlos del Rio, Emory University, USA SB 42 Building Strategic Alliances to Help Sustain Programme and Organisational Impact Venue: Room F Time: 11.30-14.00 Most organisations face financial constraints. Although donor funding may be available to start a programme what happens when a project changes, or the funding decreases or ends? A rising demand for funding for both prevention and care programmes has emphasised the need to assess existing patterns of resource use and to explore alternative ways of sustaining programmes. One way organisations can work towards sustaining effective programmes is by building alliances, or actively collaborating with other organisations, not only NGOS and donors but the private sector, church, local and national government.This workshop will focus on helping participants plan a strategy to develop working relationships/alliances.

Facilitated by: George Carter, Direct Information Resources, USA; Maguette Ndiaye, BASICS/USAID, Senegal SB Venue: Room H Time: 11.30-14.00 The limited resources in the South present challenges in responding clinically to HIV. Using a clinical grand rounds format, participants will explore issues of monitoring the infection, managing opportunistic infections, using antiretroviral therapies, and palliative care. This session is designed to provide skills in assessing appropriate courses of action in clinical management. Clinicians, health care providers and persons affected by HIV are encouraged to attend. 45 Basic Evaluation Techniques for Programmes and Organisations Venue: Room I Time: 11.30-14.00 Evaluation helps project staff understand and respond to programme and organisational weaknesses, as well as highlight organisational effectiveness and programme impact.This workshop will introduce basic techniques of evaluation. Through the use of case studies, participants will develop an evaluation strategy and understand how to relate evaluation results to both improve their programmes and respond to donor demands.This workshop is aimed at those wanting to learn basic evaluation techniques. Facilitated by: Kamanee Hapugalle, Alliance, Sri Bute NHS Trust, UK SB The Wonders of E-mail Venue: Room K Time: 11.00-12.30 Electronic communication allows people to link with individuals and organisations all over the world, and is an important communication and networking tool.

On a clear day it is even possible to catch a glimpse of the mighty Mont Blanc towering in the distance. The simple but elegant silhouette of Geneva's 'Jet d'eau', the impressive 140 m (460 ft) high lake fountain, is the city's most distinctive landmark. The Geneva area has only 400,000 inhabitants, making it perhaps the smallest of the world's international centres. However, with its cosmopolitan atmosphere, its bustling commercial districts and the charming narrow streets of its old town, the city offers many faces to its visitors. Accommodation and Transport Palexpo-Hotels A local transportation network has been organised for the duration of the Conference. Further information is available at the Transportation Desk. Delegates who are accommodated in Geneva receive a TPG pass, valid on public buses in Geneva. Those accommodated in Zones 2-4 receive a CFF train pass and those accommodated in Zones 6-7 receive a ticket valid on a private bus. Further information on transport services can be obtained at the Transportation Desk in the registration area in Hall 4. In and Around Town Geneva's public transport system is excellent. Trams and buses run every few minutes to the centre and the outskirts of the city. In addition, an efficient boat service (the 'Mouettes') operates every ten minutes during the day between the left and right banks. A ticket valid for the central zones for one hour and usable on buses, trams and the 'Mouettes' costs CHF 2.20. There are ticket dispensing machines at bus and tram stops. Please note that exact change is required. Cards of twelve tickets are available for CHF 22 and should be punched at ticket dispensing machines at the start of each journey. Trains run frequently between the central station, Cornavin, and the airport, and provide a fast and regular service to towns throughout Switzerland and the rest of Europe. The smaller Gare des Eaux-Vives operates routes into neighbouring France. Business Hours Banks Banks are open Monday to Friday, 08.30-16.30, but are closed on Saturdays (except UBS, which is located in the arrivals area at the airport) and Sundays. At other times, money can be changed at the Central Station (Cornavin) and in most hotels. Shopping Most stores are open Monday to Friday 08.30-18.30 (Thursday 20.00), Saturday 08.30-17.00, and are closed on Sundays. Border-Crossing Delegates based in accommodation across the nearby French border should have their passport (and multiple access visa where appropriate) ready for inspection at each crossing. Car Rental All major car rental companies are represented at Geneva Airport. Climate Situated at 375 m (1,227 ft) above sea level, Geneva enjoys a climate falling somewhere between an East European continental climate and a West European temperate one. The average afternoon temperature in Geneva in July is 25-30 C (80 F). Credit Cards American Express, Diners Club, Eurocard, Mastercard and Visa are accepted in most hotels, restaurants and shops. CONFERENCE WORKBOOK 241 [Page 242](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0140.071/244) Currency Foreign currency and travellers' cheques can be exchanged in Switzerland at banks, exchange offices at the border, railway stations, airports, and in travel agencies and hotels. Fast-cash machines accepting the major international credit cards are available at most banks and at Palexpo, the Conference centre. The monetary unit is the Swiss franc (CHF) consisting of 100 centimes. (1 US$ = CHF 1.48 in March 1998.) All official prices such as Conference fees, social events, excursions, and accommodation are indicated in CHE Departure Shuttle buses from the airport to Palexpo will be provided for departure from Palexpo to the airport on July 3. Further details, including a timetable, are available from the Transportation Desk in the registration area in Hall 4. Drinking Water Tap water is safe to drink anywhere in Switzerland. Bottled water will be available at Palexpo. Electricity The electric current used throughout Switzerland is of 220 volts, A.C. 50 cycles. Be sure to check your equipment or purchase an adaptor if you wish to use foreign electrical appliances (computers, irons, hair-driers and so on). Embassies and Consulates An international crossroads, Geneva has a large diplomatic community. Several embassies, consulates and permanent missions are based in Geneva. Check the local telephone directory for a complete listing. Details can also be found on the Internet at http://www.itu.int/OTHER/diplomatic. Computer access to the Internet is available at Palexpo. Health Insurance Conference participants do not need financial guarantees to be admitted for hospital care in the event of a referral from on-site physicians following a medical emergency (the Conference badge acts as a guarantee). However, any costs following admission to the hospital will be billed to the patient's private health insurance where possible. If the patient has no health insurance at all, the costs will be covered by the Geneva Cantonal Hospital. Health Requirements You should have with you letters in English or French from your consulting physician, certifying in full detail what pharmaceutical products (including substitution therapies such as methadone) or relevant material you may be carrying on your person. Delegates should keep their prescriptions with them at all times in case of problems such as lost or stolen medication. Language The national languages in Switzerland are German (70%), French (19%), Italian (10%) and Romansch (1%). Geneva is in the French speaking part of Switzerland. English is widely spoken and understood throughout the country. Liability and Insurance The Conference organisers cannot accept liability for personal injuries, or for loss or damage to delegates' property either during or as a result of the Conference. Please check the validity of your own insurance. 242 12th World AIDS Conference Geneva [Page 243](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0140.071/245) Local Newspapers The three main daily newspapers, featuring local and national news, are the Tribune de Geneve, Le Temps and Le Matin. Geneve Agenda is a weekly guide to cultural events and the city's restaurants, which can be purchased at tobacconists/newspaper stands. It is available for free at the tourist office and at many of the city's hotels. Metric System Switzerland uses the metric system. Visitors will find weather temperature reports given in degrees Celsius, petrol sold by the litre, milk and wine by litres, grocery items in grammes and kilogrammes, and road speeds posted in kilometres per hour. Parking There is a large commercial carpark at Palexpo as well as long-stay parking at the airport. However, both are expected to be extremely busy during the Conference and delegates are advised to use public transport, which is very reliable in Geneva. Parking your car in the centre of Geneva can be quite difficult. Much of the city's main shopping district is accessible only to pedestrians or by tram and bus. Parking on Geneva's streets at parking metres is possible, but restricted, and it can be hard to find a place. Avoid parking in unauthorised zones - traffic wardens are on patrol throughout the day. However, many of the larger hotels offer off-street or underground parking facilities. Postal Rates Postcards and letters up to 20 grammes may be sent to anywhere in Europe or the Mediterranean countries for CHF 1.10, to other countries for CHF 1.80. Taxis Taxis in Geneva may be ordered by phone (33 141 33) or found at authorised taxi stands (in town, airport and train station). Fares between the airport and the city are in the range of CHF 15-35 and depend on traffic density, time of day and number of passengers. Expect a small extra charge for luggage. Telephone Local calls may be made for a minimum of CHF 0.60. Direct dialling abroad from public call boxes is with change (CHF 1 or CHF 5 coins) or with a phone card. We advise purchasing a phone card upon arrival (available from post offices and newspaper stands). Time Zone The local time in Switzerland is GMT +1. Tipping In restaurants, hotels, hairdressers, and so on, gratuity is now, by law, included in the price. It is not necessary to add a tip, though you may do so at your own discretion to indicate appreciation of good service.

GNP+ works in the 5 regions of the world: Africa, Asia/Pacific, Europe, Latin America/Caribbean and North America. Each region has its own priorities and programmes. GNP+ Central Secretariat P.O. Box The International AIDS Society IAS represents scientists interested in HIV and AIDS, and was founded in 1988 to organise the series of World AIDS Conferences, such as Geneva '98, Durban 2000 and Barcelona 2002, and to support participation of people from resource-poor countries in the International Conferences. IAS also arranges continuing medical education on clinical management and care, particularly in the South, advocates drug accessibility and public health interventions worldwide, counteracts discrimination, and promotes the ethical aspects of research and interventions. IAS Secretariat P.O. Box 5619 SE-114 86 Stockholm, www.ias.se INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS The International Council of AIDS Service Organisations ICASO is the international network for community-based AIDS organisations (CBOs), with particular emphasis on communities with fewer resources and within affected communities. The ICASO network is made up of regional secretariats and national focal points in the international HIV/AIDS world for gathering and disseminating information and analysis on key issues, co-ordinating the development of CBO/NGO positions on these issues, and working with key international agencies to ensure that the concerns of CBOs and NGOs around the world are articulated and represented. ICASO Central Secretariat 399 Church Street Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5B 2J6 Phone: icaso.html The International Community of Women Living with HIV/AIDS The International Community of Women Living with HIV/AIDS The International Community of Women Living with HIV/AIDS (ICW) was created in July 1992 at the World AIDS Conference in Amsterdam to improve the situation of women living with HIV/AIDS throughout the world. It aims to unite HIV-positive women around the issues which affect them all, particularly those who are isolated; encourage self-empowerment and selfsufficiency; challenge discrimination, stigma and abuse; and ensure that HIVpositive women have a voice in decisions likely to have an impact on their lives. The ICW network has members in over 70 countries. ICW 2c Leroy House, 436 Essex Road London N1 3QP ~ UNFPA UNESCO * WHO * WORLD BANK The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) is the leading advocate for global action on HIV/ AIDS. It brings together six UN agencies in a common effort to fight the epidemic: the UN's Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the World Bank. UNAIDS mobilises the responses to the epidemic of its six cosponsoring organisations and supplements these efforts with special initiatives, by sharing knowledge, skills and best practice across boundaries. UNAIDS 20, avenue Appia CH-1211 Geneva 27 Switzerland TENEBRA5S LUX The Government of the \"Republique et Canton de Geneve\" Of all the European countries, Switzerland has the highest declared rate of AIDS cases, and the State of Geneva ranks highest among the Swiss cantons. This explains why the HIV/AIDS question is critical to Geneva and Switzerland. In order to deal with the spread of this disease, the Geneva Government has adopted a model information policy and has promoted measures for prevention and treatment. Respect for human rights and the fight against all forms of discrimination are central to Geneva's policy concerning people with HIV/AIDS better to ensure their right to live as full-fledged citizens. CONFERENCE WORKBOOK 251 [Page 252](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0140.071/254) A number of national, regional and international organisations whose work is compatible with the objectives of the 12th World AIDS Conference have offered support in a range of different ways. Where possible financial contributions were made, with considerable support shown for the scholarship programme, a key feature of this year's Conference. In addition, several of the partner organisations helped to develop non-commercial satellite meetings in conjunction with the Conference. Other contributions include the allocation of meeting venues, input into programme planning, and proposals for speakers and members of working groups. The full list of partner organisations is given below: Canadian Public Health Association (CPHA) European AIDS Treatment Group (EATG) European Commission (EC) International Council of Nurses (ICN) International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFCRC) International HIV/AIDS Alliance National Council of International Health (NCIH) National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) National Institutes of Health (NIH) Network of Sex Work Projects (NSWP) United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) World Health Organisation (WHO) Organising a Conference of this size and complexity is an incredible challenge, with success made possible only through the dedication of an army of industrious, creative and talented people committed to stopping the spread of HIV and AIDS. We take this opportunity to offer our sincere thanks to the following groups and individuals, who have demonstrated tremendous support for the Conference at many stages and levels, and to say how much we appreciate their efforts and spirit.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT: VIRAMUNE 200 mg Tablets 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION: Tablets each containing 200 mg of nevirapine anhydrate (active substance). 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM: Tablets 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Nevirapine is indicated as part of combination therapy for the antiviral treatment of HIV-1 infected adult patients with advanced or progressive immunodeficiency. Most of the experience with nevirapine is in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. There is at present insufficient data on the efficacy of subsequent use of triple combination including protease inhibitors after nevirapine therapy. Refer to Section 5.1 Pharmacodyramic properties. 4.2 Posologiy and method of administratio Ohe recommended dose for nevirapine is one 200 mg tablet daily for the first 14 days (this lead-i n period should be used because it has been found to lessen the frequency of rash), followed by ore 200 mg tablet twice daily, in combination with at least two additional antiretrosiral agents to which the patient has not been previously exposed. Resistant virus emerges rapidly and uniformly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy; therefore nevirapine should always be administered in combination therapy. For concomitantly administered antiretroviral therapy, the recommended dosage and monitoring should be followed. Clinical chemistry tests, which include liver function tests, should be performed prior to initiating nevirapine therapy and at appropriate intervals during therapy. Nevirapine should be discontinued if patients experience severe rash or a rash accompanied by constitutional findings such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, swelling, muscle or joint aches, or general malaise. Patients experiencing rash during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day should not have their nevirapine dose increased until the rash has resolved. Refer to Section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use. Nevirapire administration should be interrupted in patients experiencing moderate or severe liver function ntest abormaities (excluding GGT), until the liver function tests return to baseline values. Nevirapire may then be restarted at 200 mg per day. Increasing the daily dose to 200 mg twice daily should be done with caution, after extended observation. Nevirapine should be permanently discontinued if moderate or severe liver function test abnormalities recur. Patients who interrupt nevirapine dosing for more than T days should restart the recommended lead-in dosing, using one 200 mg tablet daily for the first 14 days followed by one 200 my tablet twice daily. No data are available to recommend a dosage of nevirapine in patients with hepatic dysfunction, renal insufficiency, or undergoing dialysis. Safety and effectiveness of nevirapine in paediatric patients under the age of 16 have not been established. Nevirapine should be administered by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV infection. 4.3 Contra-indications Nevirapine is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of the medicinal product. 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use On the basis of pharmacodynamic data (see section 5.1) nevirapine should only be used with at least two other antiretroviral agents. Severe and life-threatening skin reactions have occurred in patients treated with nevirapine, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and rarely, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Fatal cases of TEN have been reported. Nevirapine must be discontinued in patients developing a severe rash or a rash accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, swelling, muscle or joint aches, or general malaise. While nevirapine is extensively metabolized by the liver and nevirapine metabolites are extensively eliminated by the kidney, the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine have not been evaluated in patients with either hepatic or renal dysfunction. Therefore, nevirapine should not be used in patients with hepatic or renal failure. Abnormal liver function tests have been reported with nevirapine, some in the first few weeks of therapy, including cases of hepatitis which have resulted in at least one fatal outcome. Nevirapine administration should be interrupted in patients experiencing moderate or severe liver function test abnormalities (except for isolated, asymptomatic GGT elevations) until liver function tests return to baseline values. Nevirapine may then be restarted at 200 mg per day. Increasing the daily dose to 200 mg twice daily should be done with caution, after extended observation. Nevirapine should be permanently discontinued if moderate or severe liver function abnormalities recur. Because clinical hepatitis has occasionally been reported in nevirapine treated patients, some in the first few weeks after initiation of therapy, monitoring of ALT (SGOT) and AST (SGOT) is strongly recommended, especially during the first 6 months of nevirapine treatment. Nevirapine is not a cure for HIV-1 infection; patients may continue to experience illnesses associated with advanced HIV-1i infection, including opportunistic infections. The long-term effects of nevirapine are unknown at this time. Nevirapine therapy has not been shown to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV 1 to others through sexual contact or blood contamination. Patients should be instructed that the major toxicity of nevirapine is rash. They should be advised to promptly notify their physician of any rash. The majority of rashes associated with nevirapine occur within the first 6 weeks of initiation of therapy. Therefore, patients should be monitored carefully for the appearance of rash during this period. Patients should be instructed that dose escalation is not to occur if any rash occurs during the two-week lead-in dosing period, until the rash resolves. Any patient experiencing severe rash or a rash accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, swelling, muscle or joint aches, or general malaise should discontinue medication and consult a physician. Nevirapine may interact with some medicinal products; therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctor the use of any other medications. Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine might lower the plasma concentrations of these medications. For this reason, and to reduce the risk of HIV transmission, barrier contraception (e.g., condoms) is recommended. Additionally, when oral contraceptives are used for hormonal regulation during administration of nevirapine therapeutic effect should be monitored. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Nucleoside Analogues: No dosage adjustments are required when nevirapine is taken in combination with zidovudine, didanosine, or zalcitabine. When the zidovudine data were pooled from two studies (n=33) in which HIV-1-infected patients received nevirapine 400 mg/day either alone or in combination with 200-300 mg/day didanosine or 0.375 to 0.75 mg/day zalcitabine background of zidovudine therapy, nevirapine produced a non-significant decline of 13% in zidovudine area under the curve (AUC) and a non-significant increase of 5.8% in zidovudine Cmax. In a subset of patients (n=6) who were administered nevirapine 400 mg/day and didanosine on a background of zidovudine therapy, nevirapine produced a significant decline of 32% in zidovudine AUC and a non-significant decline of 27% in zidovudine Cmax. Paired data suggest that zidovudine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine. In one crossover study, nevirapine had no effect on of the hepatic enzyme CYP3A; therefore, it is possible that co-administration with protease inhibitors (also metabolised by CYP3A) may result in an alteration in the plasma concentration of either agent. Results from a clinical trial (n=31) with HIV infected patients administered nevirapine and saquinavir (hard gelatin capsules; 600 mg t.i.d.) indicated that their co-administration leads to a mean reduction of 27% (p=0.03) in saquinavir AUC and no significant change in nevirapine plasma levels. The reduction in saquinavir levels due to this interaction may further reduce the marginal plasma levels of saquinavir which are achieved with the hard gelatin capsule formulation. Results from a clinical trial (n=25) with HIV infected patients administered nevirapine and indinavir (800 mg q8h) indicated that their co-administration leads to a 28% mean decrease (pt0.01) in indinavir AUC and no significant change in nevirapine plasma levels. No definitive clinical conclusions have been reached regarding the potential impact of co-administration of nevirapine and indinavir. A dose increase of indinavir to 1000 mg q8h should be considered when indinavir is given with nevirapine 200 mg b.i.d.; however, there are no data currently available to establish that the short term or long term antiviral activity of indinavir 1000 mg q8h with nevirapine 200 mg 8000mg q8h with nevirapine 200 mg b.id. Results from a clinical trial (n=25) with HIV infected patients administered nevirapine and ritonavir (600 mg b.i.d. [using a gradual dose escalation regimen]) indicated that their coadministration leads to no significant change in ritonavir or nevirapine plasma levels. There were no increased safety concerns noted with the coadministration of nevirapine with any of these three protease inhibitors when used in combination. Ketoconazole: In one study, administration of nevirapine 200 mg b.i.d. with ketoconazole 400 mg q.d. resulted in a significant reduction (63% median reduction in ketoconazole AUC and a 40% median reduction in ketoconazole Cmax). In the same study, ketoconazole administration resulted in a 15-28% increase in the plasma levels of nevirapine compared to historical controls. Ketoconazole and nevirapine should not be given concomitantly. The effects of nevirapine on itraconazole are not known. Although interaction studies have not been pedormed, antifungal medicinal products which are eliminated renally (e.g., fluconazole) might be substituted for ketoconazole. Oral Contraceptives: There are no clinical data on the effects of nevirapine on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives. Nevirapine might decrease the plasma concentrations of oral contraceptives (also other hormonal contraceptives); therefore, oral contraceptives should not be used as the sole method of birth control in patients being treated with nevirapine. For other therapeutic uses requiring hormonal regulation, the therapeutic effect in patients being treated with nevirapine should be monitored. Other medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A: Nevirapine is an inducer of CYP2B6, maximal induction occurring within 2-4 weeks of initiating multiple-dose therapy, Other compounds that are substrates of these isoforms may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-admisiatered with nevirspire. Therefore, careful monitoring of the therapeutic effectiveness of P450 metabolised medicinal products is rec ommerded when taken in combination with nevirapie. Other information: Monitoring of steady-state nevirapine trough plasma concentrations in patients who received long-term nevirapine treatment revealed that nevirapine trough concentrations were elevated in patients who received cimetidine (+21%, n=11) Steady-state nevirapine trough were reduced in n=19) and rifampicin (-37%, n=3), known inducers of CYP3A. There are insufficient data to assess whether dose adjustments are necessary when neviapine and rilampicin or rilabutin are co-administered. Therefore, these medicinal products should only be used in combination it clearly indicated and with careful monitoring. Studies using human liver microsomes indicated that the formation of nevirapine hydroxylated metabolites was not affected by the ritabutin, rifampicin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Ketoconazole formation of nevirapine hydroxylated metabolites. 4.6 Use during pregnancy and lactation No observable teratogesicity was detected is reproductive studies performed is pregnant rats and rabbits. There are so adequate and well-controlled studies is pregnant women. Preliminary results from an ongoing pharmacakinetic study (ACTO 250) of 10 HIV-i-infected pregnant women who were administered a single oral dose of 100 or 200 mg nevirapine at a median of 5.8 hours before delivery, indicate that nevirapine readily crosses the placenta and is found in breast milk. It is recommended that HIV-infected mothers do not breast-feed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV and that mothers should discontinue nursing it they are receiving revirapine. Nevirapine cannot be recommended for pregnant or lactating women at this time. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Somnolence has been reported in association with nevirapine therapy. 4.8 Undesirable effllects The most frequently reported adverse events related to nevirapine therapy, across all clinical trials, were rash, nausea, fatigue, fever, headache, somnolence and abnormal liver function tests. The major clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, with nevirapine attributable rash occurring in 16% of patients in combination regimens in Phase II/Itt controlled studies. In these clinical trials 35% of patients treated with nevirapine experienced rash compared with 19% of patients treated in control groups of either zidovudine+didanosine or zidovudine alone. Severe or life-threatening skin reactions occurred in 6.6% of nevirapine-treated patients compared with 1.3% of patients treated in the control groups. Overall, 7% of patients discontinued nevirapine due to rash. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. Severe and life-threatening skin reactions have occurred in patients treated with nevirapine, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and, rarely, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Fatal cases of TEN have been reported. The majority of severe rashes occurred within the first 28 days of treatment and some required hospitalization, with ore patient requiring surgical intervention. Liver function teat abnormalities have occurred is patients treated with nevirapine, some in the first few weeks of therapy, including cases of hepatitis which have resulted in at least one fatal outcome. 4.9 Overdose There is no known antidote for nevirapine overdosage. No acute toxicities or sequelae were reported for one patient who ingested 800 mg of nevirapine in one day. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: antiviral agent, ATC code J05AXO4. a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) of HIV-1. Nevirapine binds directly to reverse transcriptase and blocks the RNAdependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities by causing a disruption of the enymes catalytic site. The activity of nevirapine does not compete with template or nucleoside toiphusphates. HIV-2 reverse transcriptase and eukaryotic DNA polymerases (such as human DNA potymerases a, y, 3, or 8) are not inhibited by nevirapine. Resistance HIV isolates with reduced susceptibility (100 to 250-fold) to nevirapine emerge in vitro. Phenotypic and genotypic changes occur in HIV isolates from patients treated with eviraopine or nevirapine+zidoudie over one to 1 2 weeks. By week 8 of neviorapine monotherapy, 100% of the patients tested had HIV isolates with a >100-told decrease is susceptibility to revirapine, regardless of dose. Nevirapine+zidovudioe combination therapy did not alter the emergence rate of nevirapine-resistant virus. In a trial with nevirapine+zidovudine+didanosine in previously untreated patients, after 6 months of therapy, decreased phenotypic nevirapine susceptibility emerged in 21% (5/24) patients who had plasma submitted for testing. Virus was suppressed in the other 19 plasma specimens. The clinical relevance of phenotypic and genotypic changes associated with nevirapine therapy has not been established. Cross-resistance Rapid emergence of HIV strains which are cross-resistant to NNRTIs has been observed in vitro. Data on cross-resistance between the NNRTI nevirapine and nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors are very limited. In four patients, zidovudine-resistant isolates tested in vitro retained susceptibility to nevirapine and in six patients, nevirapine-resistant isolates were susceptibleto zidovudine and didanosine. Cross-resistance between nevirapine and HIV protease inhibitors is unlikely because the enzyme targets involved are differentL Pharmacodynamic Effects Nevirapine has been evaluated in both treatment naive and treatment experienced patients. Results from a trial (ACTG 241) evaluated triple therapy with nevirapine, zidovudine and didanosine compared to zidovudine+didanosine, in 398 HIV-1 -infected patients (mean 153 CD4+ cells/mmr; plasma HIV-1 RNA 4.59 logro copies/mi), who had received at least 6 months of nucleoside ana logue therapy prior to enrollment (median 115 weeks). These heavily experienced patients demonstrated a significant improvement of the triple therapy group over the double therapy group for one year in both viral RNA and CD4+ cell counts. A durable response for at least one year was documented in a trial (INCAS) for the triple therapy arm with nevirapine, zidovudine and didanosine compared to zidovudine+didanosine or nevirapine+zidovudine in 151 HIV-1 infected, treatment naive patients with CD4+ cell counts of 200-600 cells/mm' (mean 376 cells/mm') and a mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of 4.41 logio copies/ml (25,704 copies/ml). Treatment doses were nevirapine, 200 mg daily for two weeks, followed by 200 mg twice daily, or placebo; zidovudine, 200 mg three times daily; didanosine, 125 or 200 mg twice daily (depending on the weight). The two largest controlled trials of nevirapine described above have both evaluated nevirapine in combination with zidovudine and didanosine; there is currently limited information on long term safety and activity with combinations of other antiretroviral medicinal products. Nevirapine has also been studied in combination with other antiretroviral agents, e.g., zalcitabine, indinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir. Ongoing trials are examining nevirapine in combinations with nelfinavir, lamivudine, and stavudine. No new and overt safety problems have been reported for these combinations, but clinical experience is still somewhat limited. Studies are on-going to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapies with nevirapine in patients failing protease inhibitor therapy. Data will be collected on the efficacy and safety of protease inhibitor therapy following failure with nevirapine combination. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Nevirapine is readily absorbed (>90%) after oral administration in healthy volunteers and in adults with HIV-1 infection. Absolute bioavailability in 12 healthy adults following single-dose administration was 93 ~ 9% (mean SD) for a 50 mg tablet and 91 ~ 8% for an oral solution. Peak plasma nevirapine concentrations of 2 ~ 0.4 pg/mI (7.5 aM) were attained by 4 hours following a single 200 mg dose. Following multiple doses, nevirapine peak concentrations appear to increase linearly in the dose range of 200 to 400 mg/day. Steady state trough nevirapine concentrations of 4.5 ~ 1.9 pg/ml (17 / 7 pM), (n = 242) were attained at 400 mg/day. The absorption of nevirapine is not affected by food, antacids or medicinal products which are formulated with an alkaline buffering agent (e.g., didanosine). Nevirapine is nonionized at physiologic pH. Following intravenous administration to healthy adults, the volume of distribution (Vdss) of nevirapine was 1.21 ~ 0.09 I/kg, suggesting that nevirapine is widely distributed in humans. Nevirapine readily crosses the placenta and is found in breast milk. Nevirapine is about 60% bound to plasma proteins in the plasma concentration range of 1-10 gg/ml. Nevirapine concentrations in human cerebrospinal fluid (n=6) were 45% (~5%) of the concentrations in plasma; this ratio is approximately equal to the fraction not bound to plasma protein. In vivo studies in humans and in vitro studies with human liver microsomes have shown that nevirapine is extensively biotransformed via cytochrome P450 (oxidative) metabolism to several hydroxylated metabolites. in vitro studies with human liver microsomes suggest that oxidative metabolism of nevirapine is mediated primarily by cytochrome P450 isozymes from the CYP3A family, although other isozymes may have a secondary role. In a mass balancelexcretion study in eight healthy male volunteers dosed to steady state with nevirapine 200 mg given twice daily followed by a single 50 mg dose of 14C-nevirapine, approximately 91.4 10.5% of the radiolabeled dose was recovered, with urine (81.3t~11.1%) representing the primary route of excretion compared to feces (10.1 x 1.5%). Greater than 80% of the radioactivity in urine was made up of glucuronide conjugates of the primary route of nevirapine biotransformation and elimination in humans. Only a small fraction (<5%) of the radioactivity in urine (representing <3% of the total dose) was made up of parent compound; therefore, renal excretion plays a minor role in elimination of the parent compound. Nevirapine has been shown to be an inducer of hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolic enzymes. The pharmacokinetics of autoinduction are characterized by an approximately 1.5 to 2 fold increase in the apparent oral clearance of nevirapine as treatment continues from a single dose to two-to-four weeks of dosing with 200-400 mg/day. Autoinduction also results in a corresponding decrease in the terminal phase half-life of nevirapine in plasma from approximately 45 hours (single dose) to approximately 25-30 hours following multiple dosing with 200-400 mg/day. The pharmacokinetics of nevirapine have not been evaluated in patients with either renal or hepatic dysfunction. Although a slightly higher weight adjusted volume of distribution of nevirapine was found in female subjects compared to males, no significant gender differences in nevirapine plasma concentrations following single or multiple dose administrations were seen. Nevirapine pharmacokinetics in HIV-1 infected adults do not appear to change with age (range 19-68 years) or race (Black, Hispanic, or Caucasian). Nevirapine has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Preclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans other than those observed in clinical studies based on conventional studies of safety, pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. Long-term carcinogenicity studies of nevirapine in animals are currently under progress. In reproductive toxicology studies, evidence of impaired fertility was seen in rats. 6.
