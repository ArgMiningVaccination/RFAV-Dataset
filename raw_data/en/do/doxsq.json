[signup] What are Essential Oils? [Essential oils](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/essential-oils/index.cfm) are concentrated plant extracts. These oils are obtained through a process of mechanical pressing or distillation and are made to retain the smell and flavor. They are usually made from different parts of the plant, including the plant, flowers, leaves, and fruit, to capture the compounds of the plants. These compounds can vary from each plant species and plant to plant. Essential oils can be used for therapeutic effects, which is called [aromatherapy](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/aromatherapy-do-essential-oils-really-work). Each essential oil has unique compounds which can affect the body differently. Therefore it is crucial to use them properly for safety and effectiveness. It is important to note that synthetic oils are not considered real essential oils. What is Herbal Medicine? [Herbal medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/herbal-medicine) uses plants or products made from plants to improve our health or treat diseases. Herbal medicine can also be referred to as botanical medicine or phytomedicine. Herbal medicines can come in various forms, such as dried, chopped, powdered, capsules, or liquids. This medicine can be administered orally as a tincture, tea, or supplementation. They can also be applied as a lotion, gel, or cream on the skin.

Herbal medicine may also be considered when conventional treatments aren't working to treat the condition. Many people use this form of medicine as the primary form of medicine or as adjunctive care with conventional medicine. A common misperception is that herbal medicine is generally very safe and non-toxic.

Therefore, it is recommended to ensure the quality of the herbal medicine by consulting with a qualified integrative or functional medicine practitioner. It's important also to note that from a functional medicine perspective, herbal medicine should not be used only to alleviate symptoms but to address [underlying imbalances](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/why-you-cant-swap-your-pharmaceutical-for-an-herbal-equivalent) that may be contributing to or causing the condition while promoting the body's innate healing response.

Top Functional Medicine Labs That Can Help Individualize Treatment for Skin Disorders Functional medicine practitioners order the following labs to help detect underlying causes of skin disorders: Comprehensive Stool Tests By conducting a [comprehensive stool](https://www.rupahealth.com/lab-tests/vibrant-wellness-gut-zoomer-3-0-complete) test, you can gain valuable information about the balance of gut bacteria, inflammatory markers, and the presence of leaky gut using zonulin as a key biomarker. Research consistently demonstrates that enhancing gut barrier function can positively impact [skin barrier](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/a-functional-medicine-approach-to-eczema) function. Hormone Panel Testing for [hormones](https://www.rupahealth.com/lab-tests/vibrant-america-hormones-panel) for skin conditions such as [acne](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/functional-medicine-protocol-for-treatment-of-acne) is important. Acne often results from hormone imbalances, particularly an excess of androgen hormones. Conditions like PCOS, characterized by elevated androgens, frequently lead to acne. Hormonal fluctuations during puberty, pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause can also trigger acne. Additionally, increased insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels contribute to acne by promoting sebaceous gland growth and excess sebum production. Food Sensitivity Panel Certain [skin conditions](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/functional-medicine-protocol-for-treatment-of-acne), such as acne, may be influenced by specific [food reactions](https://www.rupahealth.com/lab-tests/food-sensitivity-1-food-sensitivity-2-iga-igg). Dairy products and sugar, for instance, are linked to acne due to their potential to raise IGF-1 levels. Moreover, food sensitivities can disrupt gut health, leading to dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability, commonly referred to as \"leaky gut,\" which can contribute to the development of acne. Micronutrient Panel This [micronutrient test](https://www.rupahealth.com/lab-tests/vibrant-america-micronutrients-panel) examines 40 essential vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fatty acids, and other markers. Nutrient deficiencies have been associated with the susceptibility of [warts](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/integrative-dermatology-approaches-to-treating-warts-testing-and-topicals). Zinc deficiency, for instance, has been linked to increased occurrence of warts. Adequate levels of various micronutrients are crucial for a strong immune response, including defense against HPV, the virus that causes warts.

They have been beneficial for inflammatory skin conditions like acne, warts, and cold sores. Essential oils and herbal medicine have also improved wrinkles, skin tone, and pigmentation. However, it's critical to understand that these approaches may have some side effects, and the botanical quality should be assessed. They may also interact with certain medications and supplements. Therefore, you should consult with a qualified functional medicine practitioner if you would like to incorporate these into your skin regimen. "}
