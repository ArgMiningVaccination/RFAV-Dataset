Using a vaporiser in you home or on your office desk is a great way to keep bugs at bay; if unfortunately, you already have a cold, using a vaporiser can help you get over your cold a little quicker, it will also help you breathe more easily if you choose decongestant essential oils. Vaporiser Blend to boost your immune system 5 drops of Lemon, Citrus limonum 3 drops of Cardamon, Ellettaria cardamomum Vaporiser blend to help you get over your cold 4 drops of Eucalyptus, Eucalyptus globulus 2 drops of Tea Tree, Melaleuca alternifolia Sweet Thyme, Thymus zygis CT linalool Vaporiser blend to 5 drops of Atlas Cedarwood, Cedrus atlanticus 1 drops of Tea Tree, Melaleuca alternifolia 2 drops of Eucalyptus, Eucalyptus globulus Regular massage can also boost your immune system. Research shows that having regular treatments can improve your immunity. By adding essential oils your aromatherapist can choose oils that have immune boosting properties. My particular favourite and effective immune boosting Essential Oils are: Bergamot, Citrus bergamia - fresh, citrus aroma with dry notes, uplifting to body & soul Lemon, Citrus limonum -sharp and refreshing, Lemon has naturally occurring antiseptic qualities Black Pepper, Piper nigrum -warm and spicy aroma, great for achy muscles too! Ravensara, Ravensara aromatica - a soft 'eucalyptus' type aroma that will ease decongestion You could always add your favourite essential oils to a vegetable oil and use your blend as body oil every other day, over the coming months. Add 1 drop of essential oil to every 5ml of base oil. Three oils are a good combination. Of course, its important to eat healthy, get a good night's sleep and exercise regularly to also help improve your immune system. Any queries please don't hesitate "}
