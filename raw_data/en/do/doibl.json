He has been considered the most respected and most decorated colonel of all the officers within all of the Fascirian Empire. Origins[ ] Not much is known about his past; but what is known is that he was born Dankbar Toten, but later changed his name after an accident. He was clearly born on Aryanus Prime and therefore grew up under the fascist reign of his people and grew up knowing one day he would be the future of his people's regime. He was well educated and ended up specializing in diseases and pathogens. This is what got him started in working as a pathologist for the Fascirian Empire by his 20s. He was known for his knowledge of diseases and utilized that to create new vaccines and cures. Transformation[ ] By the 22nd century; Toten was approached by the Fuhrer Wolfgang Adler, who explained to him the discovery of an ancient disease that was said to have turned people exposed to it into flesh eating [Zombies](/wiki/Zombies). He immediately got to working on the disease and see what made it tick. After several weeks of analysis; Toten found that the disease possessed unique qualities that enabled a person to become invulnerable to physical pain and that only certain things can kill them. He decided to test the disease on several people; in hopes of creating an army of zombies, but after injecting his subjects, he was actually bitten by one and therefore was infected. Now with the disease in his body; Toten eventually became a zombie because of the bite on his arm and therefore; was placed in a cell with his subjects as well. Several centuries later; the [Militia](/wiki/Militia) became an ally of the Fascirian Empire and therefore introduced new and advanced medical technology. They introduced a new pathologist too who assisted in the permanent stabilization of Toten while a zombie; in fact, Toten was the first to be tested with such a thing. Toten eventually regained his ability to think and even speak; as well as being re-instated as a colonel. 24th Century[ ] Now after regaining his intelligence and his normal abilities; Toten took on the name Untoten due to him being undead and now working with the new pathologist to make a new and improved army of SS troops. Within a few months; Untoten now had an army of level 3 zombies at his disposal. Adler placed him in command of such a force in order to see it's effectiveness on the battlefield. Adler ordered that Untoten's men be tested against the [Intergalactic Alliance of Freedom](/wiki/Intergalactic_Alliance_of_Freedom) and so they were indeed tested against their greatest enemy. They managed to kill off a significant amount of troops; however it was later the [Onkians](/wiki/Onkians) that later discovered their weakness. The I.A.F then managed to kill off a major amount of Untoten's troops; nearly his whole army was depleted. This caused him to order a tactical retreat.
