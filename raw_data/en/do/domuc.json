When applied to the [skin](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/picture-of-the-skin), honey might serve as a barrier to moisture and keep [skin](https://www.webmd.com/teens/teen-skin)from sticking to wound dressings. It might also provide nutrients and chemicals that speed wound healing. But honey can become contaminated with germs during production. Although rare, some infants have gotten [botulism](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/food-poisoning/what-is-botulism)from taking honey by [mouth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/ss/slideshow-mouth-problems). People commonly use honey for burns, wound healing, swelling and sores inside the [mouth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/rm-quiz-mouth-myths), and [cough](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/overview). It is also used for many other conditions but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these other uses. There is also no good evidence to support using honey for COVID-19. Don't confuse honey with [bee pollen](https://www.webmd.com/balance/bee-pollen-benefits-and-side-effects), bee venom, or royal jelly, which are other types of bee products. Uses & Effectiveness ? Possibly Effective for - Burns. Applying honey preparations directly to burns seems to improve healing. - Cough. Taking a small amount of honey by mouth at [bedtime](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/childs-bedtime)appears to reduce coughing spells in children aged 2 years and older. Honey appears to be at least as effective as the [cough medicine](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cough-syrup-cough-medicine) [dextromethorphan](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-363/dextromethorphan+hbr+oral/details). But it is not clear if honey reduces cough in adults. - Foot sores in people with diabetes. Applying dressings containing honey to diabetic foot ulcers seems to reduce healing time and prevent the need for [antibiotics](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/rm-quiz-antibiotics-myths-facts). - Dry eye. Using specific honey eye drops or eye gel in the [eyes](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/picture-of-the-eyes)(Optimel Manuka plus eye drops or Optimel Antibacterial Manuka Eye Gel) helps to make [dry eyes](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/eye-health-dry-eyes)feel better. These products can be used along with regular dry eye treatment such as lubricant drops and warm cloths on the [eyes](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/ss/slideshow-eye-conditions-overview). [Cold sores](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-cold-sores-basics)(herpes labialis). Applying honey to [cold sores](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/ss/slideshow-cold-sores)seems to improve healing time. - Sores and ulcers of the mouth and gums caused by herpes virus (herpetic gingivostomatitis). Rinsing the mouth and then slowly swallowing honey helps these sores and ulcers heal faster in children who are taking a [medication](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx)called [acyclovir](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-941/acyclovir+oral/details). - Swelling ( [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation)) and sores inside the mouth (oral mucositis). Rinsing the mouth and then slowly swallowing honey before and after [chemotherapy](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/chemotherapy-what-to-expect)or [radiation therapy](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/what-to-expect-from-radiation-therapy)sessions seems to reduce the risk of developing mouth sores. - A [skin](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/skin-conditions-faq)condition that causes redness on the face ( [rosacea](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/skin-conditions-rosacea)). Applying a topical honey product to the [skin](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/nutrients-for-healthy-skin)might improve symptoms of rosacea. - Wound healing. Applying honey preparations directly to wounds or using dressings containing honey seems to improve healing. Honey seems to reduce odors and pus, help clean the wound, reduce infection, reduce pain, and decrease time to healing. Possibly Ineffective for - Acne. Applying honey to the face doesn't help treat acne. - High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood ( [hyperlipidemia](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/hyperlipidemia-overview)). Taking honey by mouth does not seem to reduce lipid levels in people with high cholesterol. - Swelling ( [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/women/ss/slideshow-what-is-inflammation)) of the nasal cavity and sinuses (rhinosinusitis). Using honey in a [nasal spray](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/nasal-sprays)doesn't help improve symptoms in people who have frequent sinus infections. Side Effects [low blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/heart/understanding-low-blood-pressure-basics), and chest pain. When applied to the skin or on the inside of the mouth: Honey is likely safe for most adults. When applied into the eye: It is possibly safe to use specific eye drops containing manuka honey (Optimel Manuka Plus Eye Drops; Melcare, Biomedical Pty Ltd). These eye drops are usually applied into the eyes 2-3 times daily for up to 4 weeks. When applied into the nose: Diluted manuka honey solution is possibly safe for most adults when sprayed into the nose for up to 2 weeks. Special Precautions and Warnings [low blood pressure](https://www.webmd.com/heart/understanding-low-blood-pressure-basics), and chest pain. When applied to the skin or on the inside of the mouth: Honey is likely safe for most adults. When applied into the eye: It is possibly safe to use specific eye drops containing manuka honey (Optimel Manuka Plus Eye Drops; Melcare, Biomedical Pty Ltd). These eye drops are usually applied into the eyes 2-3 times daily for up to 4 weeks. When applied into the nose: Diluted manuka honey solution is possibly safe for most adults when sprayed into the nose for up to 2 weeks. Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Honey is likely safe when taken in food amounts. But there isn't enough reliable information to know if it is safe to use honey in medicinal amounts when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to the amounts found in foods. Children: Honey is likely safe when taken by mouth in children who are at least one year old. Honey is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth by children less than 12 months old. Do not use honey in infants under 12 months old. Botulism poisoning is a risk at this age. But this is not a danger for older children or adults. Diabetes: Using large amounts of honey might increase [blood sugar levels](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/guide/normal-blood-sugar-levels-chart-adults)in people with type 2 diabetes. Honey contains sugar and should be used in moderation. Pollen allergies: Avoid honey if you are allergic to pollen. Honey, which is made from pollen, may cause allergic reactions. Interactions ? Medications that slow blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs) interacts with HONEY Honey might slow blood clotting. Taking honey along with medications that also slow blood clotting might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding. Phenytoin (Dilantin) interacts with HONEY Honey might increase how much phenytoin the body absorbs. Taking honey along with phenytoin might increase the effects and side effects of phenytoin. Moderate Interaction Be cautious with this combination Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrates) interacts with HONEY Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Honey might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications. Minor Interaction Be watchful with this combination Dosing [View References] Abbey, E. L. and Rankin, J. W.
