To learn about services at JCMC, visit www.rwjbh.org/hudsoncounty.While performing an open- heart operation last June, Tyrone Krause, MD, felt intense pain in his right inner groin. \"I broke into a sweat, and I lay down as soon as I could,\" says Dr. Krause, Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Jersey City Medical Center (JCMC) and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. Soon, the surgeon learned that he would need his own operation to repair the cause of the pain: an inguinal hernia, a condition in which body tissue or organs bulge through surrounding muscle wall. Dr. Krause knew that traditional \"open\" surgery, requiring a large incision, would require up to a month off from work to heal\u2014but his patients could not wait. \"If heart surgeries are delayed, the repercussions can be serious,\" he says. So he turned to Anroy Ottley, MD, MSc, FACS, Chief of Robotic Surgery at JCMC and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group, a leader in single-incision, minimally invasive laparascopic surgical procedures. Dr. Ottley has performed more than 1,150 such surgeries, not only fixing hernias but operating on spleens, kidneys, intestines, gallbladders, adrenal glands and other parts of the body. \"He has as much experience with robotic repair as anyone anywhere,\" says Dr. Krause. SMALL INCISIONS In a robot-assisted surgery, Dr. Ottley makes \u00bc-inch cuts to insert instruments that are attached to a robot. He then controls the instruments from a console, with a screen showing 3D images. \"The images are seven times as magnified as the ones doctors use while operating laparoscopically, so you get a lot more detail,\" he explains. The da Vinci Xi Surgical System has four arms that can rotate three times as much as the human wrist, Dr. Ottley says. The benefits of smaller incisions include less pain, bleeding, infection, scarring and other complications. That means shorter recoveries and hospital stays, often by three to five fewer days. Narcotic painkillers are rarely necessary post-surgery. Another bonus: Dr. Ottley performs surgery not only during the week but also Saturdays, which meant Dr. Krause could be operating again on Monday. According to the latest available figures, the use of robotic surgery spiked from 1.8 to 15.1 percent of all general surgery procedures from 2012 to 2018. One day 90 percent of minimally invasive operations will be robotic, Dr. Ottley predicts. As it turned out, Dr. Krause had two hernias, one on each side, but only three \u00bc-inch cuts were needed. By the following Monday, he was fully recuperated and replacing a mitral valve in the heart of one of his own patients. Not only that, he says, \"I haven't had a problem with hernias since.\" From left, the da Vinci Xi Surgical System surgeon console, vision cart and patient cart. TYRONE KRAUSE, MD THE REASON ONE SURGEON PREFERRED IT FOR HIS OWN PROCEDUREWHY CHOOSE ROBOTIC SURGERY? ANROY OTTLEY, MD Healthy Together 4 Center offers orthopedic services at 355 Grand Street and also at our Newport location, 100 Town Square Place, Jersey City. To learn more, visit www.rwjbh.org/hudsoncounty.\"In icy weather, people are vulnerable to slipping when they're on uneven ground,\" says John Feldman, MD, an orthopedic surgeon at Jersey City Medical Center and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. \"That's especially true in the city, where uneven sidewalks and curbs can make navigation difficult.\" Potential perils also lurk indoors, as ice gets tracked in near doorways, melts and becomes a slipping hazard. He offers these simple guidelines for an injury-free season: Keep arms free if possible. \"We've evolved to walk upright, and when we walk, without our even thinking about it, our arms provide a natural counterbalance to our gait,\" says Dr. Feldman. \"Carrying a briefcase, grocery bag or tote bag means you're not well-balanced and also are less ready to catch yourself if you do fall. Consider using a backpack or anything else that will keep your arms free.\" Stow your smartphone. \"It's essential not to become distracted, especially when walking in a city environment with a lot of foot traffic and street traffic,\" says Dr. Feldman. Opt for a treaded sole. \"It's very important to wear boots in the winter, or anything with a good tread on the sole,\" says Dr. Feldman. \"If your work shoes don't have those, don't wear them on your commute. Bring your work shoes with you to change into.\" Walk flat-footed. \"When you walk with a flat foot, you maximize the area in which your feet touch the ground. Keep knees slightly bent, slow down and take shorter-than-usual strides to avoid slipping,\" says Dr. Feldman. Consider a walking aid. Options include a trekking pole, walking stick, cane or walker. \"For older people, especially, balance issues make falls more of a risk. Keep in mind that the best treatment for falls is prevention,\" says Dr. Feldman. \"Also, if you're having trouble with balance, a physical therapist can give you really good exercises to strengthen your core muscles.\" WHAT TO DO IF YOU FALL Elevate the injured extremity to prevent swelling. Wrap the injured area with an ACE bandage or compression wrap. See your primary care provider to determine whether you need X-rays or to see a specialist. Go to the Emergency Department if: Y ou can't bear weight on a foot or leg, or lift your arm, without extreme pain.

COVID- 19: A TIMELY TREATMENT Healthy Together | 6 | Winter 2022 Jersey City Medical Center | RWJBH.ORG/JERSEYCITY 7 JCMC_EDVaccines_Winter22_Final_10.5.indd 6JCMC_EDVaccines_Winter22_Final_10.5.indd 6 12/9/21 3:30 PM12/9/21 3:30 PMYou have a fever, cough, shortness of breath, body aches and other symptoms. They could be signs of COVID-19 or of the flu, or of some other condition altogether. What should you do? Most people should get a COVID-19 test and follow up with their primary care physician, says Schubert Perotte, MD, Chair of Emergency Medicine at Jersey City Medical Center (JCMC). Tests are available free of charge at select pharmacies and health centers. (Find a site near you at www.hhs.gov/coronavirus.) However, if your symptoms are severe, go to the Emergency Department (ED) for a test and evaluation. \"Come in if you are having a significant amount of coughing with shortness of breath, or really high fever with shaking, chills and diarrhea,\" says Dr. Perotte. \"We worry about those patients progressively getting worse or getting dehydrated. We also advise that you go to the ED if you have COVID-19 symptoms and are of advanced age, have multiple medical problems or are immune-compromised in some way, shape or form.\" AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT Patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 within the preceding 10 days may be eligible for monoclonal antibody therapy. The treatment may be advised for patients with mild, moderate or severe symptoms, as well as for people with risk factors such as kidney disease, diabetes or a compromised immune system. \"We've been very successful with monoclonal antibodies,\" says Dr. Perotte. \"We can get patients turned around pretty quickly.\" The human body naturally makes antibodies to fight infection. However, most people don't have antibodies designed to recognize a new virus like SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies are made in a laboratory to fight a specific infection, in this case SARS-CoV-2. The antibodies are given through a one-time infusion to a person who has already been diagnosed with COVID-19. Patients get temporary enhanced immunity, which helps them avoid a potentially dangerous progression of the disease. \"This treatment is provided here in the ED, not in a doctor's office, because it requires an intravenous infusion and the patient has to be monitored for any adverse reactions,\" says Dr. Perotte. VACCINES STILL KEY Monoclonal antibody therapy doesn't replace the need for a COVID-19 vaccine, says Dr. Perotte. The type of immunity that results from monoclonal antibodies is not the same as the type of immunity created by the vaccine. A vaccine helps stimulate a person's own immune system so it's prepared and ready to respond if it's exposed to a virus. That protection is more effective and lasts much longer than the protection given by monoclonal antibodies. \"Vaccinated or unvaccinated, we will treat you with monoclonal antibodies if you are eligible,\" says Dr. Perotte. \"However, in the case of a breakthrough infection\u2014in which a vaccinated person comes down with COVID-19\u2014the vaccinated patients have had better outcomes and fewer symptoms compared to their unvaccinated counterparts.\" While the majority of COVID-19 patients don't need to be admitted to the hospital, \"a very small percentage of them may require hospitalization based upon their symptoms, diagnostics and vital signs,\" says Dr. Perotte. Monoclonal antibody therapy is available in EDs throughout RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH), the health system to which JCMC belongs. RWJBH was among the first health systems in the state to administer monoclonal antibody treatment, which was authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November 2020. This past October, RWJBH celebrated a milestone by delivering its 10,000th dose. To learn more about COVID-19, visit www.rwjbh.org/covid19. SCHUBERT PEROTTE, MD GET VACCINATED FOR COVID-19 AND THE FLU, TOO Both the flu and COVID-19 are spread mainly by large and small particles containing viruses that are expelled when people with the illness cough, sneeze or talk. Last year, masking and social distancing contributed to a very mild flu season. But with those practices relaxed this year, healthcare experts are worried about a long winter battling both the flu and COVID-19. The good news is that unlike last year, vaccines are widely available for COVID-19, in addition to vaccines to protect against the flu. \"Some people ask if it's safe to get both flu and COVID-19 vaccines,\" says Schubert Perotte, MD, Chair of Emergency Medicine at JCMC. \"The answer is that patients who have gotten both vaccines have done just fine.\" The Emergency Department is not the place to go for vaccines, however. \"There are plenty of outpatient sites for vaccines,\" Dr. Perotte says, \"and we strongly encourage everyone to get both.\" Healthy Together | 6 | Winter 2022 Jersey City Medical Center | RWJBH.ORG/JERSEYCITY 7 JCMC_EDVaccines_Winter22_Final_10.5.indd 12/9/21 3:30 PM12/9/21 3:30 PMMaria Del Rosario Rivas, 60, a patient at Jersey City Medical Center's Greenville Primary Care Practice, was an excellent candidate for services at the Food FARMacy. Maria, who was overweight and dealing with diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure, wanted to lose weight and feel better. She was identified through a screening process conducted by Kristin Carlino, MS, RDN, who works with patients at the Food FARMacy. \"I started meeting with Kristin every month,\" Maria says. \"She gives me advice about what to eat and drink and what not to.\" Maria's typical breakfast went from sweetbread and coffee with creamer and sugar to a spinach omelet, toast and coffee with sugar-free creamer. Lunch is no longer cold cuts with mayonnaise, but salad with tuna fish or chicken. For dinner, chicken is baked, not fried, and salads or vegetables take up half the plate; rice or pasta is limited to a quarter of the plate, which Maria saves for last and is sometimes too full to eat. She now drinks water or Crystal Light instead of cola. She used to be fatigued by walking, but now she walks to and from the store regularly. \"I'm not going to lie\u2014it was hard at the beginning,\" Maria says. \"But now I like how I look and feel. I've lost 40 pounds, and I have more to go.\" FOOD OPPORTUNITIES The Food FARMacy\u2014which was launched with a generous grant from ACME's Nourishing Neighbors Community Relief Program and JCMC Foundation Board Member Suraj Kaufman and his Sneaker Room Foundation\u2014provides food and education customized for the health needs of its clients. The program has a well-stocked pantry from which patients can take a bag of groceries that suit their tastes and dietary needs. \"We're giving people with chronic diseases access to healthy food as well as instructions on how to portion their foods and pair them so they end up improving their condition,\" says Carlino. \"People can choose the foods they like from the wide selection we have, and I'll walk around with them and provide suggestions.\" In addition to nutrition counseling, the Food FARMacy helps its clients connect with food resources they might not have known about or known how to apply for. For clients like Maria, the Food FARMacy has been transformational. \"She is very dedicated and has done a fantastic job with losing weight in a healthy way that's going to be successful for the long term,\" says Carlino. \"Kristin has helped me so much,\" Maria says. \"I want to help other people, too, to help them lose weight and improve their health. I want to tell them to change the way they eat. It's hard, but after the first month, you'll see the difference and you're going to say, 'Yes, I want to keep going.'\"The Food FARMacy also provides Emergency Food Bags for people in need and Healthy Breakfast Bags for schoolchildren.

However, within a few days of birth, Frankie had developed severe blisters on her feet and was losing skin. Even routine screenings now posed a risk, and the baby was vulnerable to life-threatening bacteria entering her body. Her family was afraid to hold her. A diagnosis was needed, right away. Not long ago, genetic testing for infants could test just a few genes at a time, and results took weeks or months to come back. But thanks to a collaboration between Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine and RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH), Level III and Level IV NICUs in the RWJBH system can offer rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS). For medically urgent cases, preliminary diagnoses are available in three to five days. Using a blood sample, rWGS can scan a child's entire genetic makeup for thousands of anomalies. The test results provide vital information that leads to individualized care and fewer costly, invasive procedures.\"Rapid genome sequencing is a game changer,\" says Kamtorn Vangvanichyakorn, MD, Director of Neonatology at CBMC. \"It allows us to provide critical answers and targeted treatment at a time when the therapeutic window is often narrow.\" \"A SENSE OF RELIEF\" The testing revealed that Frankie has a type of epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a rare group of diseases that are most often caused by a genetic mutation. Frankie's mother, Jeri Berinato, knew that her own mother lived with a severe form of EB, leading to constant blistering and pain, difficulty swallowing, loss of her fingernails and dental problems. \"As soon as we received the results, I felt a huge sense of relief,\" Jeri says. \"Not knowing what was wrong with my beautiful newborn baby was the worst feeling I've ever had. Now I know that, with proper care from the beginning, Frankie will have a much better quality of life than my mom has.\" In addition to CBMC, rWGS is available to critically ill infants at Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital; the Unterberg Children's Hospital at Monmouth Medical Center; Children's Hospital of New Jersey at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center; and Jersey City Medical Center. The use of rWGS at RWJBH came about through a long-standing partnership between Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, the parent organization of Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine, and Children's Specialized Hospital, an RWJBH facility. \"We're proud to be the only health system in New Jersey to partner with Rady Children's to offer rapid genetic testing,\" says William Faverzani, Senior Vice President of Children's Services at RWJBH. \"With this test, our physicians have access to cutting-edge technology, enabling them to intervene quickly to improve the lives of our tiniest patients and their loved ones.\" To learn more about rapid Whole Genome Sequencing at RWJBarnabas Health, visit www.rwjbh.org/pediatricgenetictesting.KAMTORN VANGVANICHYAKORN, MD ADVANCED GENOMIC TESTING RESULTS ALLOW DOCTORS TO BEGIN TARGETED TREATMENT WITHIN DAYS. VERY SICK BABIESFAST ANSWERS FOR Healthy Together | PB | Winter 2022 RWJBarnabas Health | PM12/10/21 2:38 PMA CRISIS HAS LED TO SOME BIG CHANGES FOR THE BETTER. enabled the discovery of deep reserves of resilience and innovation. \"Many of the changes we're seeing in healthcare,\" says John Bonamo, MD, Chief Medical and Quality Officer at RWJBarnabas Health, \"are good things that came out of a terrible situation.\" Here are six examples: 1The rise of telehealth. The technology for video healthcare visits has existed for decades, but providers as well as patients resisted virtual care\u2014until the onset of COVID-19 and social distancing. \"Before the pandemic, we were doing some virtual urgent care visits, but not routinely doing scheduled visits,\" says Andy Anderson, MD, President and CEO, Combined Medical Group of RWJBarnabas Health and Rutgers Health. \"However, at the peak of the pandemic we were doing 10,000 scheduled visits weekly, and even today we continue to do thousands each week.\" The increased COVID-19 created challenges that healthcare providers had never experienced in their careers. But the pandemic, while taking a toll on providers and patients alike, has also HOW COVID-19 IS RESHAPING HEALTHCARE ANDY ANDERSON, MD JOHN BONAMO, MD Healthy Together | 10 | Winter 2022 RWJBarnabas Health | AM12/10/21 9:19 AMdemand led to technology upgrades, he says, such as making it easier to have visits that include multiple attendees\u2014patient, family members, other providers or an interpreter if needed. \"Telemedicine has opened up access for patients, who can stay in a home environment to get the healthcare they need, whether it's acute, chronic or preventive, and that will continue,\" Dr. Anderson says. \"We're moving toward a good balance of in-person and remote appointments so patients can receive care more efficiently and effectively.\"2Increased awareness of preventing the spread of disease. In response to the pandemic, healthcare providers have redoubled their efforts to sanitize spaces and even filter the air, and the use of hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes has become commonplace. \"We've always been committed to infection control through our system-wide journey to become a high reliability organization,\" says Dr. Bonamo. \"We amplified those principles to keep our facilities even safer, such as using new ventilation techniques, employing UV-C lights to clean rooms, paying continued attention to visitation policies and more.\" 3Enhanced teamwork. \"At the peak of the pandemic, the needs were so great that our people began working together much more collaboratively,\" says Dr. Bonamo. \"Instead of staying in their own lane and handing off a patient or a procedure to a specialist, providers worked together\u2014respiratory therapists teamed with nurses, primary care doctors worked in intensive care units at the elbow of intensivists, and so on. We learned how professionals can be 'skilled up' and trained to help in a crisis, and that has broken down levels of hierarchy and increased esprit de corps.\" 4An emphasis on mental well-being. \"Mental health has become a bigger issue due to the pandemic. People are afraid of becoming ill, they may have greater financial burdens and they're missing social interaction,\" says Dr. Anderson. \"Our behavioral health providers have been very busy.\" All kinds of healthcare providers are tuning in to their patients' state of mind. \"As doctors, we realize the importance of reaching out to people and asking them how they've been doing during the pandemic,\" he says. \"Everybody has a story, and it's important for us to take the time to listen and, if necessary, become an advocate or a resource for the patient.\" That kind of outreach is equally important for people who work in healthcare, Dr. Anderson says: \"In the RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group, we set aside time each week to text or call people we work with to see if they're doing OK, and provide help or a note of encouragement as needed.\" 5A brighter spotlight on healthcare disparities. \"At RWJBarnabas Health, we've had an ongoing and important system-wide effort in regard to social justice and anti-racism,\" says Dr. Bonamo. \"However, the disparity in the rates of COVID-19 sickness and death among people of color was so blatant that it brought many things to the surface and made us, as well as the healthcare industry as a whole, take a closer look. We've realized that saying 'we treat everybody the same' isn't enough because some populations have many more resources than others.\" To learn more about RWJBarnabas Health's Ending Racism Together initiative, visit www.rwjbh.org/endingracism. 6A new flexibility. \"Healthcare is intensely regulated, and because of that we have a tendency to be very prescriptive about what we can do and how we do it,\" says Dr. Bonamo. \"The COVID-19 need was so intense that we had to learn to be more flexible. For example, medical-surgical floors were turned into ICUs and we learned, OK, it may not be the ICU we would have built, but we can make this work. A lot of the old regulations were lifted during COVID-19, which enabled us to be flexible, but some of what we had been doing was just a result of old habits. Now we've expanded our horizons and have become much more nimble.\" For resources and information about COVID-19, visit www.rwjbh.org/covid19.

At Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health, your child will get the highest level of expertise and treatment, right here in New Jersey.\" The pediatric hematology/oncology team takes a multidisciplinary approach to providing the most advanced treatments for pediatric cancer and blood disorders, such as complex surgical techniques, precision medicine, immunotherapy and innovative radiation therapy procedures, including the state's only hospital-based proton therapy center. In addition, as New Jersey's only NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, Rutgers Cancer Institute offers access to cutting-edge clinical trials and cellular therapies that may not be available at other programs.A HOLISTIC APPROACH The specialists at Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBH know that, in addition to treating the body, it's important to pay close attention to the emotional and social challenges of the patient and family. \"A diagnosis of cancer turns a family's life upside down, so we have a robust psychosocial support team to address the needs not just of the patient, but of parents and siblings as well,\" says Dr. Cole. That team includes psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, social workers, nutritionists and educators. \"We're committed to keeping kids on top of their studies,\" says Dr. Cole. \"At Rutgers Cancer Institute, we have a full-time teacher on staff in the building on school days. I'll often sit with our patients and do math problems with them, though I suspect I may enjoy that much more than they do,\" he says with a laugh. He recalls a teenage patient who had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common cancer in children but also one of the most curable. \"He had to spend the first month of treatment in the hospital, away from his support network of friends and coaches,\" says Dr. Cole. \"Some of the side effects of his treatment, such as vomiting, were miserable, and he was embarrassed to lose his hair. He was depressed, but he received the support he needed from our psychosocial team. \"I'm happy to report that he's doing much better now. He's back in school on a modified schedule and if he needs any continued support from our team as he fully reenters his routine, we'll be there for him.\" The $10 million in state funding was championed by Grace Eline, a 12-year-old survivor of brain cancer and a childhood cancer awareness advocate, and her mother, Aubrey Eline, in collaboration with the American Childhood Cancer Organization. Grace was treated at Rutgers Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital of New Jersey at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center. AN INFUSION OF FUNDS FOR RESEARCH Survival rates for children with cancer have improved significantly in the past 50 years, but pediatric cancer remains the leading cause of death from disease among children. It is among the least funded areas of cancer research. Advocates cheered when a $10 million appropriation to support pediatric cancer research at Rutgers Cancer Institute was included in the New Jersey 2022 state budget. \"The funding allows us to expand our ongoing efforts. One of our areas of focus is research in children that will help reduce acute side effects of treatment and the risk of it resulting in long-term organ damage,\" explains Peter Cole, MD, Chief of the Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Embrace Kids Foundation Endowed Chair at Rutgers Cancer Institute, who is also Director, Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Cellular Therapies at Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital and Professor of Pediatrics at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. Dr. Cole's laboratory is also supported by the Hugs for Brady Foundation. \"Another area of focus is bringing innovative treatment modalities to children with cancer and blood disorders,\" Dr. Cole says, \"including cellular therapies like CAR T-cell therapy, blood and marrow transplants and immunotherapies, which use the patient's own immune cells to fight cancer.\" JODI CRANDELL PHOTOGRAPHYCENTERS FOR EXCEPTIONAL CARE RWJBarnabas Health and Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey partner to provide world-class care to New Jersey cancer patients.

Winter is prime time for heart attacks, as research studies show and doctors know all too well. \"It's expected in the hospital community that we'll see a bump in the number of heart attacks coming in during the winter season, especially around the holidays and during the first couple of months of the year,\" says Isaac Tawfik, MD, Chief of Cardiology at Monmouth Medical Center and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. \"It's been theorized that if your core temperature is lower because you're outside and not really bundled up, the body's natural response is for arteries to vasoconstrict, or to narrow,\" Dr. Tawfik explains. \"If somebody already has a narrowing or blockage in the artery, it's going to interfere with normal blood flow, and that's the definition of a heart attack.\" Ruptured plaque is another main culprit for heart attacks in cold weather, he says. \"Any exertional work that's heavy and not gradual, like HEADING OFF WINTER HEART ATTACKS ISAAC TAWFIK, MD Healthy Together | 14 | Winter 2022 RWJBarnabas Health | AM12/10/21 9:24 AMshoveling snow, puts stress on coronary arteries. If those arteries have plaque, it may crack or rupture, which can lead to a whole cascade of platelet aggregation and other inflammatory mediators that eventually lead to a heart attack.\" In winter, middle-aged patients\u2014 people in their 40s, 50s, 60s\u2014may be more prone to heart attacks than seniors. \"They feel that they're healthy enough for shoveling snow and other types of outdoor exertion, so they don't warm up first and may not wear warm enough clothing,\" Dr. Tawfik says. Unlike older patients, they may be unaware of their limitations, he notes, and may not understand the possible consequences of existing conditions, such as hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes or tobacco use. The risk of a heart attack increases with every additional risk factor a person has. \"All of this is not to say that shoveling snow is automatically going to give you a heart attack,\" says Dr. Tawfik. \"What we are saying is that if you have known heart disease, or one or more risk factors for heart disease, you should think carefully before going out to shovel snow.\"SAFEGUARD YOUR HEART How can people protect themselves against heart attacks in cold weather? \"Number one, make sure you speak to your doctor so that any risk factors you have are addressed\u2014if you have hypertension, that your blood pressure is well controlled, if you are diabetic, that your blood sugar is under control, if you are a smoker, that you are working on a cessation plan,\" says Dr. Tawfik. Stay warm when you're outside and take frequent breaks to go inside and assess how you feel. \"If you're breathing in cold air, it cools your chest a little bit. You don't necessarily have the burning in the chest that can be a symptom until you go inside,\" he says. \"Do the work in short intervals so you're not outside for hours at a time.\" Be aware of anything different in the way you feel. \"A heart attack symptom doesn't have to be chest pain, because not everybody gets that. If you're nauseous, or if you're more fatigued or breathless than you expected to be, those can be red flags,\" he says. Dr. Tawfik shows his patients images that illustrate their cardiovascular condition\u2014an X-ray, an ultrasound, a CT scan\u2014as a means of helping them grasp their risks. \"If I have a patient who's 60 years old and I can tell him his risk for heart disease in the next 10 years is X versus someone who didn't have those risk factors, they tend to be more compliant,\" he says. Dr. Tawfik advises his patients to consult their primary care physician or cardiologist before undertaking any high-effort physical activity in cold weather. \"It's like driving your car and putting a seat belt on,\" he says. \"It's always best to err on the side of safety.\" Whoever your heart beats for, our hearts beat for you.

Blood flow is restricted and the delivery of oxygen to the heart is reduced. The heart must pump harder to circulate blood through the constricted blood vessels. As a result, blood pressure and heart rate increase. A sudden spike in blood pressure, especially when combined with exertion such as shoveling, can lead to heart attack or stroke. Narrowing of or stress on coronary arteries may lead to plaque rupture and blood clots that block blood flow to the heart. Hypothermia\u2014when body temperature drops below 95 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014affects the workings of the heart, nervous system and other organs.

Sometimes patients have had a bad experience in the past, or know someone who's had one. I'll talk them through the process, sharing my own experiences if needed. \"Sometimes they feel like a diagnosis of cancer is a death sentence, so why bother finding out? I tell them there are many, many things we can do now to treat cancer successfully, especially when it's caught early.\" MAKING IT EASIER When patients are dealing with fragmented care\u2014for example, looking for a dermatologist in one system, then for a mammogram in another\u2014they find The rate of cancer screenings has rebounded almost to pre-pandemic levels since its sharp drop in the spring of 2020. That's good news, because when cancer is caught early, treatment has the best chance for success. Still, the number of Americans who get regular, recommended cancer screenings has long been below the target levels set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"People tend to put STEFAN BALAN, MD To learn more about cancer screenings provided by Jersey City Medical Center for Hudson County residents, call 844.CANCERNJ (844.226.2376).

TYPE OF CANCERSCREENING TYPERECOMMENDED AGE SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Breast (women)Mammogram Women ages 40 to 44 have the choice to start annual screenings; women ages 45 to 54 should have mammograms every year; women 55 and older can switch to every other year or can continue yearly screening.Women at high risk should have a mammogram every year beginning at age 30. This includes women who have a specific gene mutation (BRCA1 or BRCA2) or who have had radiation to the chest between ages 13 and 30. Breast (men)Physical exam, followed by diagnostic mammogram or other tests if neededA lump or swelling, skin dimpling, nipple retraction, skin redness or nipple discharge should be examined as soon as possible.A family history of breast cancer, inherited gene mutations, chest radiation and certain testicular conditions may increase male breast cancer risk. Cervical For women, a Pap test every three years and/or an HPV (human papillomavirus) test every five yearsRegular screening for women between ages 25 and 65.Both males and females can get HPV-related cancers. The HPV vaccine, recommended for children and adolescents between the ages of 9 and 16, can prevent HPV infection. Colorectal Colonoscopy is a highly effective screening for early detection.For people of average risk, regular screening at ages 45 through 75. After that, discuss with your doctor.People at increased risk may need earlier screenings: those with a personal or family history of colorectal cancer, or a personal history of radiation to the abdomen or pelvic area. Lung Low-dose CT scan (LDCT) For people ages 50 to 80 who currently smoke or have quit in the past 15 years and who have a 20- pack-year smoking history.Research has shown that LDCT scans for people at higher risk of lung cancer save more lives than X-ray screenings. Prostate A prostate-specific (PSA) blood test and/or a digital rectal examDiscuss with your healthcare provider at age 50.If you are African American or have a family history of prostate cancer, have the discussion starting at age 45. Skin A visual self-exam by the patient or clinical exam by a doctorRisk factors include exposure to natural or artificial sunlight, having fair skin and having several large or many small moles.Report any suspicious moles or spots to your doctor.

Healthy Together | 18 | Winter 2022 Jersey City Medical Center | GETS MOST PATIENTS HOME THE NEXT DAY.Roughly 20 percent of Americans over age 65 live with aortic stenosis, a condition that hinders the heart's ability to pump blood throughout the body. For years, open heart surgery was the only way to replace a failing aortic valve and reverse aortic stenosis. But that type of major surgery required a weeklong hospital stay and several months of recovery. Today, advances in technology allow doctors to replace heart valves through a minimally invasive procedure called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). \"Now, most patients can go home the next day fully functional, like nothing happened,\" says interventional A NEW FIX FOR AORTIC STENOSIS Normal Valve (closed) Valve Stenosis (closed)AORTIC VALVE Healthy Together | 20 | Winter 2022 Jersey City Medical Center | RWJBH.ORG/JERSEYCITY 21 JCMC_TAVR_Winter22_final_10.5.indd 20JCMC_TAVR_Winter22_final_10.5.indd 20 12/9/21 3:20 PM12/9/21 3:20 PMcardiologist Michael Benz, MD, Director of TAVR and Structural Heart Program at Jersey City Medical Center (JCMC), who was part of the team that performed the first TAVR at JCMC in September. HOW A VALVE HARDENS The aortic valve is one of the largest of the four heart valves in the heart. When working properly, it lets the blood out of the left ventricle, the largest chamber of the heart, into the aorta, which carries blood to the brain, muscles and other parts of the body. \"The aortic valve opens every time your heart beats,\" Dr. Benz explains. \"So if your heart beats 70 to 80 times each minute, that means your aortic valve opens and closes nearly 100,000 times each day.\" All that activity can take its toll over the years. \"For some people, the aortic valve becomes thicker and stiff, and by age 70, it doesn't open as well as it used to,\" Dr. Benz says. The heart must work harder to pump blood, and can enlarge and cause people to develop heart failure. Older age is the most common reason people develop aortic stenosis. Other, less common reasons include congenital conditions or infections like rheumatic heart disease or endocarditis. In its most serious stage, aortic stenosis can be inoperable and even deadly. \"Severe inoperable aortic stenosis has a lower five-year survival rate than pancreatic and other metastatic cancers,\" says cardiothoracic surgeon Iosif Gulkarov, MD, Associate Chief of Cardiac Surgery at JCMC and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group.IMPROVED MORTALITY First performed in Europe in 2007 and brought to the U.S. in 2011, TAVR showed promising results right from the start. \"In its earliest U.S. trials, TAVR improved mortality by 22 to 25 percent, which is amazing,\" says Dr. Benz, who has performed TAVR since 2013. At JCMC, interventional cardiologists perform TAVR inside a brand-new hybrid operating room (OR), which combines cardiac catheterization equipment as well as OR-style equipment. During the procedure, a catheter is inserted through the groin and up into the heart. The replacement aortic valve is threaded through the catheter and carefully placed in its correct location. The procedure takes about one hour. Patients stay in the hospital overnight, receive an echocardiogram the next morning to ensure the new valve is functioning properly, then return home. Originally, TAVR was only approved for the oldest and sickest patients. However, clinical trials over the years have proven its effectiveness for younger people as well. \"With the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of TAVR for low-risk patients in 2019, essentially everyone over the age of 65 with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis should be considered for TAVR,\" says Dr. Benz. IS TAVR RIGHT FOR YOU? The TAVR team at JCMC sits down with each patient to evaluate whether TAVR might be right for them. Younger patients should carefully consider which type of replacement valve they want\u2014a bioprosthetic valve (from a cow or pig) or a mechanical valve. \"Bioprosthetic valves last ten to 15 years, which means a younger TAVR patient might need a second valve replacement surgery at some point in their lives,\" Dr. Gulkarov says. \"Mechanical valves last longer but require patients to take blood thinners for the rest of their lives.\" No matter which type of valve a patient chooses, TAVR is proven to be safe and effective. \"TAVR is really revolutionary in how it helps patients live healthier and happier,\" Dr. Benz says. \"It's an extraordinary achievement for a hospital to be able to provide this type of leading-edge heart treatment.\" For more information about surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement at Jersey City Medical Center, call 866.526.8258 or visit www.rwjbh.org/TAVR.

The program already offers a minimally invasive procedure called Watchman, an alternative to blood thinners that closes the heart's left atrial appendage and prevents blood clots from forming. JCMC also expects to soon introduce MitraClip, a catheter-based procedure to fix leaky heart valves. These innovative technologies are part of the comprehensive heart services the medical center provides. \"One of the major strengths of RWJBarnabas Health is our patient-centered care and attention to detail,\" says Arash Salemi, MD, Clinical Chairman of Cardiothoracic Surgery for RWJBarnabas Health's Northern Region and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. \"We have assembled a multidisciplinary team comprised of cardiologists, interventional cardiologists, radiologists, anesthesiologists and cardiac surgeons who provide great results for our patients.\" Healthy Together | 20 | Winter 2022 Jersey City Medical Center | RWJBH.ORG/JERSEYCITY 21 JCMC_TAVR_Winter22_final_10.5.indd 21JCMC_TAVR_Winter22_final_10.5.indd 21 12/9/21 3:20 PM12/9/21 3:20 PMCreate a healthy tomorrow by leaving a lasting legacy today.
