Serena uses integrative health principals and intuitive energetic techniques to show clients how food can affect their bodies on a physiological level, as well as an energetic level. We love seeing more practitioners integrate tools that address not only physical imbalances, but the emotional and energetic issues that underlie them. Below, Serena talks to us about a key principle in holistic wellness: balance. Here's how to make it happen more often in your daily life... As supported by both science and spirituality, we know that everything in the universe is made up of energy. Energy flows in, out, about and around, but universal energy stays completely neutral. Since everything in the universe is both connected to and made up of energy, we have the ability to guide or adjust that energy flow by actively transforming it from one form into another - adding and taking away in an effort to maintain balance for energy healing. When we work with energy healing, whether applied to our physical or spiritual bodies, our goal is to achieve or create balance. In traditional Chinese medicine, the idea of yin and yang is the complementary and inseparable balance of two independent energies that represent all universal energy. The two energies work in a constant seamless dynamic flow, balancing and harmonizing and rebalancing to maintain a state of universal neutrality. When we are in balance, we are in a state of harmony \u2014 we can optimally receive the highest vibrational frequencies of everything from food and nutrition to energy healing to unconditional love and that which is intended for our highest good. With this in mind, when I work with clients on their diets, we strive to maintain this harmony \u2014 the balance that is essential to proper cleansing, detoxing and releasing. As we remove certain foods from a diet for a particular cleanse or detox, we also replace them with highly supportive foods. Similarly, with energetic cleansing and healing, we also exercise balance and harmony by replacing all released energy that no longer serves us with loving, fulfilling positive light. How To Create More Balance In Daily Life When you are conscious and conscientious of this ever-evolving state of perfect harmony, you can become your own healer and create an authentic, supportive healing system in your life. Your mind, emotions, spiritual awareness, environment, food and nutrition can constantly readjust, ever so slightly, to create balanced and optimal well-being. First, surrender and trust that you are mindfully giving yourself the opportunity to heal, grow and expand on a deeper level. Energy follows intent and your thoughts are energy. Below are ways to find balance in different aspects of your life and healing journey... Balance With FOOD | If your goal is to eat clean and lose weight, [remove inflammatory foods](http://thechalkboardmag.com/anti-inflammatory-diet-mistakes) from your meals and replace them with [nutrient-dense](http://thechalkboardmag.com/get-dense-why-you-should-be-eating-foods-with-high-andi-scores), alkalizing options. For clients who love dairy and eggs, we replace them with plant-based alternatives and avocados. BALANCe In SOCIAL SETTINGS | If you like to have a glass of wine in the evenings with dinner or enjoy happy hour cocktails with friends, make sure you balance every glass of alcohol that week with a glass of fresh, low-sugar organic green juice. BALANCE during MOVEMENT | For those of us who love rigorous, high-intensity workouts, it's harmonious and beneficial for our physical and energetic bodies to balance this out with calming, relaxing body-work like a massage or [craniosacral therapy](http://thechalkboardmag.com/craniosacral-therapy). BALANCE At WORK | Most of us need the most mindfulness when it comes to self-care. As much as it's important to be [productive and efficient](http://thechalkboardmag.com/get-more-done-productivity-tips) by working hard and with long hours, it's equally necessary to harmonize the universal energy surrounding you by bringing balance to your mind with music, meditation or connection to nature and your higher self. To create balance, remember that it's okay to allocate more time in your day to your entrepreneurial ambitions, so as long as the time you give yourself is focused attention with a clear intention for self-acceptance and energy toward your own highest good. BALANCE IN RITUAL | And for those of us who are a little woo woo: When we have our burn and release ceremonies and rituals for [energy clearing](http://thechalkboardmag.com/crystals-for-clearing-bad-energy), it's just as important to replace this release with ceremonial blessings and loving, high vibrational energy and light.
