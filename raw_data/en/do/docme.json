Not only are people searching for methods to boost immunity in the best possible way but also are looking at alternate medicines such as Ayurveda to stay healthy and disease-free always. If our immune system is healthy enough to resist foreign pathogens or substances that might cause an infection, we can call ourselves immune. By boosting immunity with a healthy lifestyle, we are helping our immune system to do a remarkable job in its fight against external aggressors. The basic immune system, which we are born with, undergoes multiple strengthening processes since our birth and becomes a powerful shield of protection against infection causing microbes. However, unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyle and stress can deteriorate our immune system thereby weakening immunity and making us susceptible to infections. Experts say that following an Ayurvedic lifestyle would definitely help improve our health and immunity. Enhance Immunity with the Help of Ayurveda Ayurveda believes in the interconnectedness of mind, body and nature and hence, Ayurvedic treatments are specifically designed to prevent diseases rather than cure them. According to Ayurveda, there are three fundamental bio-elements (doshas) in our body - Vata, Pitta and Kapha, and health exists only when there is balance between these three elements. Hence, Ayurvedic practitioners emphasize on eliminating the impurities that are causing the disease rather than directly addressing the disease. Ayurveda discourses a healthy lifestyle that incorporates meditation, yoga and a wholesome diet comprising natural and herbal components. This way of living not only improves immunity power, which naturally makes us more resistant to infections, but also helps reduce stress and worries thus preventing lifestyle diseases. Ayurvedic medicines can be had without any worry as they do not contain any harmful ingredients or chemicals making them a safer option any day.

Ayurvedic herbs for immunity such as Amla, Ginger, Ashwagandha, Tulsi, Garlic, and Turmeric boost your immunity and strengthen immune system. These herbs are known to help increase the immunity by correcting and creating a balance between the doshas - vata, pitta and kapha. 5 Ayurvedic products that will boost your immunity Zandu Immunity Booster range is specifically designed to improve your immune system naturally.

Newborns have low immunity, hence, they are easily prone to immune disorders, infections, cold and flu, etc. As they grow old, their immunity levels increase or decrease according to the lifestyle they lead. By playing outdoor games, following a healthy diet and sleeping adequately can enhance their immunity. A great way to build your child's immunity is by providing them with vitamin C immune boosters. With age, the immunity we acquired from our childhood and adolescence begins to weaken and we tend to fall sick more frequently as the body fails to fight against the microbes as effectively as it used to be.
