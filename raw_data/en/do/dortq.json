Spiritual healing has been practised for many centuries and its gentle, non-invasive but effective powers have ensured it is now used often alongside mainstream complimentary therapies. Spiritual Healing draws on the highest universal source of energy, and we respond to it as we are, as we now know through the studies of quantum physics, that we are energy beings. Energy is innately intelligent and always goes where it is most needed and wherever it will be of the most benefit. It has no side effects or interactions with medication, and like homeopathy, it works alongside conventional medicine. Healing energy is channelled by healers from Universal Source through their energy field and via their hands to the client. Although Spiritual Healing is very gentle and subtle it can also be powerful and can help bring about feelings of calm, peace, clarity and comfort and can help us to connect to our Higher Selves and our own inner resources. Spiritual Healing can help boost our energy levels when we are feeling exhausted and calm us when we are feeling stressed and anxious. Spiritual Healing has been found to be successful in many controlled experiments such as in \"The Healing Energy\" by Professor Gary Schwartz and also \"Spiritual Healing\" by Daniel J Benor.
