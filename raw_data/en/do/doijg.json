This knowledge originated in India more than 5,000 years ago and is often called the \"mother of all healing.\" It places emphasis on prevention and encourages maintaining health by paying close attention to balance in one's own life through diet, lifestyle, and herbs. It empowers one to understand how to create balance between the body, mind and consciousness according to one's individual constitution (prakruti) as well as how to make lifestyle changes to maintain balance based on one's current constitution (vikruti). Our constitutions are made up of the three Doshas, which are a central element of Ayurveda and the basis of a personalized approach to health. The three doshas are; Vata, Pitta, Kapha; each derived from the 5 elements and representative of a unique blend of physical, emotional, and mental characteristics inherent in every individual.
