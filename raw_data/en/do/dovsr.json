Reporting an adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) An adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) is any untoward medical event that occurs after a vaccination has been given which may be related to the vaccine itself or to its handling or administration. A conclusion regarding a causal relationship with the vaccine is not necessary to suspect or report an AEFI. An AEFI is a notifiable condition under the ACT Public Health Act (1997). All uncommon, unexpected or serious AEFI, or any event considered to be significant following immunisation, must be notified by medical practitioners or other health professionals to: - the ACT Health Immunisation Unit on (02) 5124 9800 (Monday-Friday, 8.30am to 4.30pm) - online using the [Immunisation adverse event reporting form (online form)](https://actredcap.act.gov.au/redcap/surveys/?s=XD9DEYFHW7)or - fax and/or email using the [COVID-19 Vaccine Adverse Event Following Immunisation Reporting Form](https://health.act.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-02/Immunisation%20-%20COVID-19%20AEFI%20reporting%20form.pdf). Routine notifications can be made during business hours. For urgent advice after hours, contact the Immunisation Unit on [(02) 5124 9800 ](ph:0251249800)and follow the prompts. All notifications of AEFI received by ACT Health will be reported on to the [Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)](https://www.tga.gov.au).
