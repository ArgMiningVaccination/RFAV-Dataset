You can eat certain kinds of nutritional food to feel healthy on the spiritual level of your body. People eat a lot of fast foods and other unhealthy meals. Fresh natural food undoubtedly makes you feel good even though you may not want to admit it. Examples of these natural foods are fruits and vegetables. These foods increase your spiritual health. Why Is It Important to Eat Natural Foods? In our busy lives, we find it hard to prepare meals from the earth's natural ingredients. We find it easier and cheaper to eat refined and processed foods. All packaged and ready to eat. Attaining spiritual health needs you to put in that extra effort. Chopping up vegetables for a salad isn't that hard. Some fruits don't even have to prepared. Pop a few grapes in your mouth and enjoy the burst of goodness. Naturally occurring fruits and vegetables contain a myriad of nutrients that your body needs. Examples of these include vitamins like Vitamin A, C, Vitamin B1, B2, and many others. Your body also gains minerals from fruits and vegetables for example calcium, magnesium, sodium and iron among others. These help our bodies to fight against diseases, and keep us healthy every day. These foods also increase your spiritual health by helping to detox the mind. 6 Foods to Increase Your Spiritual Health I already mentioned how natural foods are the best foods to increase your spiritual health. Let's go further and identify the most beneficial foods for your soul. 1 | Water Water is very important to our bodies. It is used for so many purposes including manufacturing of blood, digestion of food, regulating body temperature, hydrating organs, and many others. Everyone knows that water makes up 70% of our bodies. Water is also important for spiritual health and growth. Water cleanses and detoxifies your body. Drink a glass or two of water after you wake up every morning. It will help your soul feel clean and fresh. 2 | Organic fruits and vegetables increase spiritual health Fruits and vegetables are a miracle. They are grown from the earth. This means that they are going to transfer to you all the good minerals from the earth, as well as the nutrients they create. Food direct from nature is good for our bodies, and spiritually enriching. Try to add more fruits and vegetables to your meals to increase your spiritual health. 3 | Sprouts Sprouts refer to seeds that are germinated and eaten raw at that stage, or cooked. Germinated seeds have a lot of nutrients within them to help them to grow. This means that they are in the process of growth. I always find germination so interesting. I love seeing dormant seeds coming to life. Sprouts contain so many nutrients, and these foods can increase your spiritual health because they are growing things, after all. 4 | Fermented foods Fermented foods are created by the action of microorganism like good bacteria. Examples include yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kombucha, pickles and many other such foods. They contain loads of nutrients and also their own set of good microorganisms that are good for your gut. These foods increase your spiritual health by cleansing your body. 5 | Superfoods increase spiritual health Superfoods refer to a special group of foods that contain an immense load of nutrients, even more than usual. They also contain anti-oxidants that prevent oxidation of the molecules in our bodies. Superfoods are amazing foods that keep your body health and fight of chronic diseases. Superfoods aptly vibrate at high frequencies which are transferred to us when we eat them. 6 | Citrus Fruits These are my personal favorite because they are so colorful and juicy. Examples of citrus fruits include oranges, tangerines, lemons and grapefruits. Citrus fruits are rich in Vitamin C which is important for growth and repair of tissue in the body. It also protects our bodies from diseases. Furthermore, it hydrates the body and keeps us generally healthy. Citrus fruits are easy to incorporate into your diet, and I recommend you to have citrus fruits everyday to feel refreshed. Food Helps in Spiritual Health Healthy foods directly help in increasing your spiritual health, but they also promote spiritual health by keeping your physical body healthy. Good food has immense benefits to the body. It helps in building and maintaining our bodies, protecting us from diseases and gives us energy to do our everyday tasks. Good food also contributes towards a refreshed soul.
