Clients Feedback Our Clients Reviews Dr. Jared is amazing. Patient and diligent, he takes the time to understand what's going on with your body and customizes the treatment just for you. NOT some factory of back cracking. True attention to each individual. He also does other treatments as needed but only as appropriate and only to the patient's comfort level. His background as an RN gives him an even deeper understanding of the body. I love him!!! I had a back injury and did not know of any Chiropractor's in my area. I literally picked Chiropractor Center of Erie from a Google search. I couldn't be happier. Dr. Dave is friendly, informative and a great resource for all Chiropractic questions. He is gentle and professional at all times. I highly recommend Chiropractic Center of Erie and Dr. Dave. Thank you for all you do! I have been a dental hygienist for the past 10 years & experience a lot of neck, shoulder & back pain from the job. Dr. Sharon is absolutely amazing, she keeps me moving! I have seen a lot of chiropractors & she is the absolute best one I have ever seen! I highly recommend her, she has helped me so much! Thank you Dr. Sharon! Best and most effective adjustment I've ever had! I came in with neck pain, muscle spasms, and tension headaches that had persisted for two weeks. One adjustment with Dr. Josh and I felt 80% relief immediately. Then over two weeks, we worked out the remaining 20%. I highly recommend! I recently had a massage. It was very soothing. I was so relaxed that I almost fell asleep. Summer is very accommodating. She will apply EOs if you like that. I needed to release tension in body and now I feel more rested. I'm glad I came. Thank you Summer! Conditions we treat What We Treat Ready to take the first step towards pain-free living? Schedule your appointment today!
