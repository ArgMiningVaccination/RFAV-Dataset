In fact, about [1 in 5 adults](https://www.nami.org/learn-more/mental-health-by-the-numbers) experience anxiety, approximately [46.6 million adults](https://www.nami.org/learn-more/mental-health-by-the-numbers) in a given year. Anxiety disorders are considered to be highly treatable, yet [less than half](https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics) of those suffering receive treatment. In addition, an estimated [17.3 million adults in the United States have experienced at least one major depressive episode](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression.shtml). Furthermore, [chronic stress is a national epidemic for all genders and ages](https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/united-states-of-stress), which can be both the cause and the effect of anxiety and depression. Despite conventional medicine's best efforts, the numbers of [ those affected by depression, anxiety,](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/254610/WHO-MSD-MER-2017.2-eng.pdf) or chronic stress continue to rise. Unfortunately, conventional anxiety and depression medications often have harsh [side effects](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666.php), including weight loss or gain, sexual dysfunction, headaches, sleep problems, and drowsiness to name a few. The success of other treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy has shown that \"therapist training is a strong predictor of treatment outcome, and many therapists offering CBT services are not sufficiently trained to deliver multiple manual-based interventions with adequate fidelity to the model.\" With such a challenging outlook for those with anxiety, depression, and chronic stress in our country, it's clear we need a new approach. Ayurveda is a 5000-year-old holistic wellness and health care system that provides a solid foundation for individuals seeking to regain a life without anxiety, depression, and chronic stress. Our authentic approach includes rejuvenation and detoxification to heal and restore the body to its optimal health, while various tools for stress reduction, exercise, cleansing, and lifestyle practices provide ongoing support in the reduction or elimination of anxiety and depression. It is possible to regain a life with happiness, clarity, and emotional stability with our anxiety, depression, and chronic stress retreat. \"A 380-acre sanctuary... a balancing act of rest and activities\" Our Holistic Approach to Addressing Anxiety, Depression, and Chronic Stress Sometimes our autonomic nervous system gets stuck in \"fight or flight\" mode, which creates a sense of chronic stress. You'll learn how to settle the nervous system and restore inner balance. [Read More](#) Our autonomic nervous system consists of two main divisions, the sympathetic (fight or flight) and parasympathetic (rest and digest) systems. The sympathetic (fight or flight) gets turned on when we are in immediate danger and need to make a decision fast for survival. Our parasympathetic system (rest and digest system) gets turned on when our bodies are in a relaxed state so that we can sleep, relax, and digest food. It's not uncommon to see individuals sympathetic system get stuck \"on\" which puts an individual in a constant fight or flight mode. This has a major impact not only on our autonomic nervous system but our entire body, which can be felt as chronic stress and result in anxiety and depression. How do you get your autonomic nervous system to function normally again? Ayurveda. Effective for centuries, this authentic, transformative health care and wellness system helps individuals holistically manage health conditions. Stress reduction and the regulation of a balanced nervous system is a major component in the restoration of health. A highly-effective, powerful stress reduction tool is the cultivation of meditation practice. Meditation techniques: - Are proven to reduce stress and anxiety - Can be adjusted to your unique spiritual path - Can be practiced daily to bring the body into alignment with the rhythms of nature - Create a sense of stability within your body so that when life throws you a curveball, your body doesn't take the blow Special breathing techniques and meditations, such as [Sudarshan Kriya](https://www.srisriravishankar.org/sudarshan-kriya/)\u00ae (SKY), will be taught during the program so you can find a deeper sense of balance and well-being. Our SKY technique has been scientifically-proven to [reduce levels of stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573542/) and decrease the stress hormone, cortisol, by 50%. Additionally, SKY also: - Relieves anxiety and depression - Supports the immune system - Promotes feelings of well-being - Improves physical, psychological, and social health - Improves overall quality of life Did you know that your digestion and diet can play a significant role in anxiety in depression? A healthy gut can significantly contribute to a more steady and calm mind and body state. [Read More](#) Did you know that your digestion and diet can play a significant role in anxiety and depression? A healthy gut can significantly contribute to a more steady and calm mind and body state. In the health and wellness system of Ayurveda, it is recognized that each individual has a unique genetic makeup or constitution, and foods that are good for one individual may be bad for another. For example, certain types of food like spicy or fermented foods may be beneficial for some, while harmful to others. If you are not eating the right food for your unique body type, and your digestion is not functioning correctly, it can cause toxic build-up or inflammation in your body which can result in anxiety and depression and further imbalance. This is just one of the reasons we take an individualized approach to health and well-being. With our program, you will have the opportunity to work one-on-one with one of our world-class Ayurvedic practitioners and board-certified western medical doctor to determine a customized diet specifically for you. Nourish your body, restore balance, detox, and experience deep relaxation with authentic Ayurvedic treatments. [Read More](#) Nourish your body, restore balance, detox, soothe the nervous system, and experience deep relaxation with authentic and therapeutic Ayurvedic treatments. Enjoy a blend of therapies to cleanse and rebuild the tissues within to restore your optimum health and vitality. Our mind, body, and spirit are so deeply interconnected that true restoration of health only happens when we treat the whole. Ayurveda is grounded in this principle. Effective for centuries, Ayurveda harnesses the natural intelligence of your body to bring deep rest and rejuvenation physically, mentally, and emotionally. After consultation with one of our Ayurvedic practitioners, our highly-trained Ayurvedic therapists work with your body and unique constitution to encourage healing, growth, and physical stress relief, bringing you into an open, blissful, and restored state. Yoga consists of natural rhythmic exercise that are calming in nature and help boost the production of the happy hormone, [serotonin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r54-1), which has shown to be lower in those with [depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21415718). [Read More](#) There is evidence to show that chronic stress can cause the onset of anxiety and depression. Likewise, the daily management and impact of anxiety and depression can create stress, and so the cycle perpetuates. Stress heavily impacts the mind state, sleep, general daily functioning, and can cause physical symptoms such as headaches and tension in the body. The body and mind then struggle to manage the increase in stress hormones, which can trigger the body to shift into a permanent 'fight, flight or freeze' mode, distort perspective leading to negative thinking, and much more. The connection between stress, anxiety, and depression is clear, and the approach to the restoration of health must, therefore, encompass all elements. Yoga is an effective holistic tool to manage physical, mental, and emotional well-being\u2014daily and in the long-term. It has been practiced for over 5,000 years and is one of the most natural movements to the body. Have you ever seen a baby or a dog waking up from a nap? Have you noticed how they naturally stretch and perform yoga poses intuitively? Yoga consists of natural rhythmic exercise that are calming in nature and help boost the production of the happy hormone, [serotonin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/#r54-1), that have been shown to be lower in those with [depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21415718). In addition to helping in the production of serotonin, yoga can increase your heart rate variability (HRV), an indicator of the body's ability to respond to stress more flexibly. Another aspect of yoga is breathwork, and this can restore present moment awareness to help stabilize the mind from oscillating between past regrets and future worries\u2014a major factor that can trigger anxiety and depression. Awareness also positively enhances the mind-body connection and supports individuals' ability to regulate breathing to rebalance in moments of stress and anxiety. Toxic build-up in the body and mind can cause many underlying health issues. An Ayurvedic cleanse will deeply heal and restore your well-being and natural vitality. [Read More](#) In Ayurveda, toxic build-up can block channels in the body and be the underlying cause of many health issues, including anxiety and depression. There are various causative factors like the consumption of particular foods that are unsuited to your unique your body type, a too low or too high digestive capability that prevents the absorption of nutrients, and environmental toxins, just to name a few. Diet and exercise alone may not be successful in clearing out the toxic build-up. During your treatment, we'll focus on the elimination of toxins in the body, which can be a major contributing factor to the onset and ongoing nature of anxiety and depression. Through a specialized cleansing process unique to Ayurveda, you will work one-on-one with an Ayurvedic practitioner to determine which Ayurvedic cleansing techniques are best for you. Ayurvedic massages and a gentle detoxification process will be used to mobilize and eliminate toxins in the body. These techniques have been shown to restore digestive power, energy flow in the body, inner balance, and vitality.
