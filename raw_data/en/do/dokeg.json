In 2006, I co-founded Living Natural Inc. in Nashua, NH, with a vision to create a family medical center that focused on natural therapeutics and integrative complimentary personalized medicine. In 2008, I advanced my studies in Ayurvedic medicine and became a student at the Kripalu School of Ayurveda. In 2010, I joined the faculty at the Kripalu School of Ayurveda and was teaching for the school until 2020. In 2017, I joined the faculty of Mahatma School of Ayurveda in Williston, Vermont and continue my journey teaching students from around the country and the world. I am passionate about Naturopathic and Ayurvedic principles and practices and my mission from the beginning has been to empower my clients to understand the nature of health and disease. Using a prevention and personalized model, I have guided thousands of clients and have dedicated my practice to promoting natural medical principles. I am a specialist in nutrition, Ayurveda, homeopathy, herbal medicinal and I have years of experience integrating western medicine with natural therapeutics. In 2019, with the expansion of my Brattleboro office I decided to close and downsize my practice in Nashua NH. I currently have a satellite office located at the Vitality Studio inside the Spinal Corrective Center in Amherst, NH. If you are interesting in learning more about my practice, please feel free to contact my office at (802)490-2077. Kindly, Dr. Margrit Mikulis As they fell from heaven, the plants said \"Whichsoever living soul we pervade, that man will suffer no harm\". - The Rig Veda \"I encourage my clients to become active participants in their health and wellness journey.\" Together we discover that the vital force of nature is the foundation for healing. And then the magic begins. Nutrition will be our focus, and the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda layers an in depth understanding between the interplay of the cosmos, the human experience and our environment. Our products are here!
