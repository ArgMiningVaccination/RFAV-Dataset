Over 200 clinical trials designed to verify the efficacy of homeopathic treatments have been published, many (but not all) of which have led to positive results. The main principle of homeopathy is- \u00e2??a remedy can cure a disease if it produces in healthy person symptoms similar to those of the disease\u00e2?. It is said that \u00e2??like cures like\u00e2?. Homeopathic remedies are diluted to such an extent that there can be no possible side effects from even the most toxic substances. The dilution process is known as 'Potentization'. Taken in this ultra-diluted form, these remedies have no side effects and are perfectly safe, non-toxic and nonaddictive. This concept has been proved through nanotechnology which says that particles which are tinier than the viruses are capable to act on human body. Homeopathy has good role in managing immunological diseases. From homoeopathic point of view immunological diseases are chronic constitutional disorders, therefore we require individualistic approach as patient responds to medicine according to its constitution and susceptibility. The constitutional medicines are drawn out after thorough understanding of concerned individual. These medicines can help decreasing the intensity of symptoms and can thus improve standard of living. During the session, we would discuss how a case of ankylosing spondylosis and psoriasis was managed with homeopathic medications. Homeopathic medicines can help in treating immunological diseases, but proper research must be done to understand the efficacy of homeopathic medicines in immunological cases. Faisal Mohammed Hanif Girach has completed his Master Degree from India. He is practicing homeopathy over a period of 10 years and has shown good results in various diseases with homeopathic medicines. At present, he is lecturing at Cyberjaya University College of Medical Science, Malaysia. It is one of the only government recognized university college to offer Homeopathy course in entire South East "}
