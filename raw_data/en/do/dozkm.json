The aim was to investigate from a physical, chemical, mechanical and biological perspective, a protocol for using chemical products (citric acid, sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride) to improve and maintain water quality in dental unit waterlines. Change in microhardness and corrosion tendency were observed in stainless steel samples. On the polyurethane surfaces, there were changes in color, microhardness and roughness. Anti-biofilm evaluations revealed a significant reduction in the biofilm biomass, metabolic activity and residual biofilm. These findings suggest that the protocol analyzed in this study showed an innovative potential against biofilm in dental unit waterlines, preserving the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the materials.
