The key herb is Tianma (Gastrodia elata), the tuber of a rare orchid traditionally highly valued in the folk medicine systems of Southwest China. Tianma contains precursors to levodopa and other chemical ingredients that modern pharmacology considers effective for the treatment of spasmodic disorders. The Shen Nong's Materia Medica (Shen Nong bencao jing), China's earliest single herb primer, went even further by naming it Guiduyou (Controller of Demons) and classifying it as an anti-Gu herb with strong anti-inflammatory and life prolonging properties. While Banxia Baizhu Tianma Tang can be used for any chronic disorder involving phlegm and internal wind, Balance Pearls specifically aims to utilize the ancient neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of this remedy. Multiple ingredients are added that make the formula suitable for the long-term treatment of neurological issues and brain chemistry disorders.
