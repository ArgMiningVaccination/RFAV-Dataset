Research Focus Radiation therapy, Immunotherapy, Melanoma, Sarcoma, Head and Neck Cancer Dr. Zachary Morris treats patients with melanoma and soft tissue sarcomas. His independent translational research laboratory focuses on the mechanisms whereby radiation may enhance the response to immunotherapies. He also serves as vice chair of the department and program director for the University of Wisconsin Bentson Translational Research Fellowship. Radiation may augment the local and systemic anti-tumor immune response to cancer immunotherapies. In the Morris Lab, we are focused on using preclinical and translational research approaches to study the mechanisms whereby radiation may impact the anti-tumor response to immunotherapies. Our primary objective is to determine whether and how radiation may optimally be employed to simultaneously modulate the tumor immune microenvironment and to increase the susceptibility of tumor cells to immune response. We seek to test these approaches in early phase clinical studies where they may be further refined with the ultimate aim of improving survival and achieving cures in patients with metastatic cancers. In Situ Tumor Vaccination In situ tumor vaccination is a therapeutic strategy that seeks to convert a patient's own tumor into a nidus for enhanced presentation of tumor-specific antigens in a way that will stimulate and diversify an anti-tumor T cell response. Radiation therapy elicits an anti-tumor effect through induction of DNA damage in tumor cells, yet it has long been recognized that host immune capability and tumor immune susceptibility modulate the sensitivity of a tumor to radiation. The mechanisms by which local radiation may interact with the immune system include release of tumor-specific antigens, phenotypic changes in tumor cell expression of immune susceptibility markers and local eradication of suppressive immune cell lineages. By modulating tumor immune tolerance and functional immunogenicity at a targeted site, radiation may serve as a method of in situ tumor vaccination. Multiple preclinical studies demonstrate that random tumor-specific protein mutations are among the most immunogenic tumor antigens recognized by T cells. By rendering such antigens accessible to immune recognition, radiation may augment the local and systemic anti-tumor response to immunotherapy. If proven effective, such combinations might transform RT from a predominantly loco-regional treatment to a critical component of systemic therapy.

Role: Principal Investigator (Morris, Kuo) Effects of Radiation on Tumor Cell Immune Susceptibility Prior studies have consistently demonstrated phenotypic upregulation of FAS and MHC-I following radiation therapy, and recent studies have suggested mechanisms whereby radiation may influence tumor expression of the checkpoint ligand, PD-L1. The time course, potentially shared underlying mechanisms and the possibility of a broader impact of radiation on expression of other phenotypic markers of tumor immune susceptibility remain to be clarified. Given the potential capacity of radiation to synergize with immunotherapies, it is vital to understand not only how radiation may affect tumor cell susceptibility to immune response but also to define the time course and mechanism of such effects.

Online ahead of print. - [More](#) Radiation is commonly used as a treatment intended to cure or palliate cancer patients. Despite remarkable advances in the precision of radiotherapy delivery, even the most advanced forms inevitably expose some healthy tissues surrounding the target site to radiation. On rare occasions, this results in the development of radiation-associated secondary malignancies (RASM). RASM are typically high-grade and carry a poorer prognosis than their non-radiated counterparts. RASM are characterized by a high mutation burden, increased T cell infiltration, and a microenvironment that bears unique inflammatory signatures of prior radiation, including increased expression of various cytokines (e.g., TGF-, TNF-, IL4, and IL10). Interestingly, these cytokines have been shown to up-regulate the expression of PD-1 and/or PD-L1-an immune checkpoint receptor/ligand pair that is commonly targeted by immune checkpoint blocking immunotherapies. Here, we review the current understanding of the tumor-immune interactions in RASM, highlight the distinct clinical and molecular characteristics of RASM that may render them immunologically \"hot,\" and propose a rationale for the formal testing of immune checkpoint blockade as a treatment approach for patients with RASM.

However, only a few RT-IT combinations have been tested successfully in patients with cancer, highlighting the urgent need for an improved understanding of the interaction between RT and IT in both preclinical and clinical scenarios. Every year since 2016, ImmunoRad gathers experts working at the interface between RT and IT to provide a forum for education and discussion, with the ultimate goal of fostering progress in the field at both preclinical and clinical levels. Here, we summarize the key concepts and findings presented at the Sixth Annual ImmunoRad conference.

Radiation therapy (RT) can increase tumor inflammation and infiltration by lymphocytes but does not improve responses to ICIs in these patients. This may result, in part, from additional effects of RT that suppress anti-tumor immunity, including increased tumor infiltration by myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells. We hypothesized that anti-estrogens, which are a standard of care for ER+ breast cancer, may ameliorate these detrimental effects of RT by reducing the recruitment/ activation of suppressive immune populations in the radiated TME, increasing anti-tumor immunity and responsiveness to ICIs. METHODS: To interrogate the effect of the selective estrogen receptor downregulator, fulvestrant, on the irradiated TME in the absence of confounding growth inhibition by fulvestrant on tumor cells, we used the TC11 murine model of anti-estrogen resistant ER+ breast cancer. Tumors were orthotopically transplanted into immunocompetent syngeneic mice. Once tumors were established, we initiated treatment with fulvestrant or vehicle, followed by external beam RT one week later. We examined the number and activity of tumor infiltrating immune cells using flow cytometry, microscopy, transcript levels, and cytokine profiles. We tested whether fulvestrant improved tumor response and animal survival when added to the combination of RT and ICI. RESULTS: Despite resistance of TC11 tumors to anti-estrogen therapy alone, fulvestrant slowed tumor regrowth following RT, and significantly altered multiple immune populations in the irradiated TME. Fulvestrant reduced the influx of Ly6C+Ly6G+ cells, increased markers of pro-inflammatory myeloid cells and activated T cells, and augmented the ratio of CD8+: FOXP3+ T cells. In contrast to the minimal effects of ICIs when co-treated with either fulvestrant or RT alone, combinatorial treatment with fulvestrant, RT and ICIs significantly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of RT and fulvestrant can overcome the immunosuppressive TME in a preclinical model of ER+ breast cancer, enhancing the anti-tumor response and increasing the response to ICIs, even when growth of tumor cells is no longer estrogen sensitive.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-directed positron emission tomography (PET) may identify additional areas of disease. In this work, we investigated using both PSMA PET and mpMRI in planning focal intraprostatic boosts using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: We evaluated a cohort of patients (n = 13) with localized prostate cancer who were imaged with 2-(3-(1-carboxy-5-[(6-[18F]fluoro-pyridine-2-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl)-ureido)-pentanedioic acid (18F-DCFPyL) PET/MRI on a prospective imaging trial before undergoing definitive therapy. The number of lesions concordant (overlapping) and discordant (no overlap) on PET and MRI was assessed. Overlap between concordant lesions was evaluated using the Dice and Jaccard similarity coefficients. Prostate SBRT plans were created fusing the PET/MRI imaging to computed tomography scans acquired the same day. Plans were created using only MRI-identified lesions, only PET-identified lesions, and the combined PET/MRI lesions. Coverage of the intraprostatic lesions and doses to the rectum and urethra were assessed for each of these plans. RESULTS: The majority of lesions (21/39, 53.8%) were discordant between MRI and PET, with more lesions seen by PET alone (12) than MRI alone (9). Of lesions that were concordant between PET and MRI, there were still areas that did not overlap between scans (average Dice coefficient, 0.34). Prostate SBRT planning using all lesions to define a focal intraprostatic boost provided the best coverage of all lesions without compromising constraints on the rectum and urethra. CONCLUSIONS: Using both mpMRI and PSMA-directed PET may better identify all areas of gross disease within the prostate. Using both imaging modalities could improve the planning of focal intraprostatic boosts.

Epub 2023 May 22. - [More](#) The in situ vaccine effect of radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to be limited in both preclinical and clinical settings, possibly due to the inadequacy of RT alone to stimulate in situ vaccination in immunologically \"cold\" tumor microenvironments (TMEs) and the mixed effects of RT in promoting tumor infiltration of both effector and suppressor immune cells. To address these limitations, we combined intratumoral injection of the radiated site with IL2 and a multifunctional nanoparticle (PIC). The local injection of these agents produced a cooperative effect that favorably immunomodulated the irradiated TME, enhancing the activation of tumor-infiltrating T cells and improving systemic anti-tumor T cell immunity. In syngeneic murine tumor models, the PIC+IL2+RT combination significantly improved the tumor response, surpassing the single or dual combinations of these treatments. Furthermore, this treatment led to the activation of tumor-specific immune memory and improved abscopal effects. Our findings suggest that this strategy can be used to augment the in situ vaccine effect of RT in clinical settings.

Online ahead of print. - [More](#) PURPOSE: In this prospective phase 2 trial, we investigated the toxicity and patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes in patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the prostate gland and a simultaneous focal boost to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-identified intraprostatic lesions while also de-escalating dose to the adjacent organs at risk. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible patients included low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer (Gleason score 7, prostate specific antigen 20, T stage 2b). SBRT was prescribed to 40 Gy in 5 fractions delivered every other day to the prostate, with any areas of high disease burden (MRI-identified prostate imaging reporting and data system 4 or 5 lesions) simultaneously escalated to 42.5 to 45 Gy and areas overlapping organs at risk (within 2 mm of urethra, rectum, and bladder) constrained to 36.25 Gy (n = 100). Patients without a pretreatment MRI or without MRI-identified lesions were treated to dose of 37.5 Gy with no focal boost (n = 14). RESULTS: From 2015 to 2022, a total of 114 patients were enrolled with a median follow-up of 42 months. No acute or late grade 3+ gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was observed. One patient developed late grade 3 genitourinary (GU) toxicity at 16 months. In patients treated with focal boost (n = 100), acute grade 2 GU and GI toxicity was seen in 38% and 4% of patients, respectively. Cumulative late grade 2+ GU and GI toxicities at 24 months were 13% and 5% respectively. Patient-reported outcomes showed no significant long-term change from baseline in urinary, bowel, hormonal, or sexual quality-of-life scores after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: SBRT to a dose of 40 Gy to the prostate gland with a simultaneous focal boost up to 45 Gy is well tolerated with similar rates of acute and late grade 2+ GI and GU toxicity as seen in other SBRT regimens without intraprostatic boost. Moreover, no significant long-term changes were seen in patient-reported urinary, bowel, or sexual outcomes from pretreatment baseline.

The roles of tumor volume, tumor model, and the addition of checkpoint blockade in the efficacy of CpG + OX40 in-situ vaccination remains unknown. METHODS: Mice bearing flank tumors (B78 melanoma or A20 lymphoma) were treated with combinations of CpG, OX40, and anti-CTLA-4. Tumor growth and survival were monitored. In vivo T cell depletion, tumor cell phenotype, and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) studies were performed. Tumor cell sensitivity to CpG and macrophages were evaluated in vitro. RESULTS: As tumor volumes increased in the B78 (one-tumor) and A20 (one-tumor or two-tumor) models, the anti-tumor efficacy of the in-situ vaccine decreased. In vitro, CpG had a direct effect on A20 proliferation and phenotype and an indirect effect on B78 proliferation via macrophage activation. As A20 tumors progressed in vivo, tumor cell phenotype changed, and T cells became more involved in the local CpG + OX40 mediated anti-tumor response. In mice with larger tumors that were poorly responsive to CpG + OX40, the addition of anti-CTLA-4 enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy in the A20 but not B78 models. CONCLUSIONS: Increased tumor volume negatively impacts the anti-tumor capability of CpG + OX40 in-situ vaccine. The addition of checkpoint blockade augmented the efficacy of CpG + OX40 in the A20 but not B78 model. These results highlight the importance of considering multiple preclinical model conditions when assessing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy regimens and their translation to clinical testing.

Basic, translational, and clinical research are now investigating therapeutic combinations of these agents. In comparison to external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), TRT has the unique advantage of treating all disease sites following intravenous injection and selective tumor uptake and retention-a particularly beneficial property in metastatic disease settings. The therapeutic value of combining radiation therapy with immune checkpoint blockade to treat metastases has been demonstrated in preclinical studies, whereas results of clinical studies have been mixed. Several clinical trials combining TRT and immune checkpoint blockade have been initiated based on preclinical studies combining these with EBRT and/or TRT. Despite the interest in translation of TRT and immunotherapy combinations, many questions remain surrounding the mechanisms of interaction and the optimal approach to clinical implementation of these combinations. This review highlights the mechanisms of interaction between anti-tumor immunity and radiation therapy and the status of basic and translational research and clinical trials investigating combinations of TRT and immunotherapies.

We have reported that a single fraction of 12 Gy EBRT combined with intratumoral anti-GD2 hu14.18-IL2 immunocytokine (IC) effective in situ vaccine (ISV) against GD2-positive murine tumors. This ISV is effective in eradicating single tumors with sustained immune memory; however, it does not generate an adequate abscopal response against macroscopic distant tumors. Given the immune-stimulatory capacity of radiation therapy (RT), we hypothesized that delivering RT to all sites of disease would augment systemic antitumor responses to ISV. METHODS: We used a syngeneic B78 murine melanoma model consisting of a 'primary' flank tumor and a contralateral smaller 'secondary' flank tumor, treated with 12 Gy EBRT and intratumoral IC immunotherapy to the primary and additional EBRT to the secondary tumor. As a means of delivering RT to all sites of disease, both known and occult, we also used a novel alkylphosphocholine analog, NM600, conjugated to 90Y as a targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT). Tumor growth, overall survival, and cause of death were measured. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate immune population changes in both tumors. RESULTS: Abscopal effects of local ISV were amplified by delivering as little as 2-6 Gy of EBRT to the secondary tumor. When the primary tumor ISV regimen was delivered in mice receiving 12 Gy EBRT to the secondary tumor, we observed improved overall survival and more disease-free mice with immune memory compared with either ISV or 12 Gy EBRT alone. Similarly, TRT combined with ISV resulted in improved overall survival and a trend towards reduced tumor growth rates when compared with either treatment alone. Using flow cytometry, we identified an influx of CD8+ T cells with a less exhausted phenotype in both the ISV-targeted primary and the distant secondary tumor following the combination of secondary tumor EBRT or TRT with primary tumor ISV. CONCLUSIONS: We report a novel use for low-dose RT, not as a direct antitumor modality but as an immunomodulator capable of driving and expanding antitumor immunity against metastatic tumor sites following ISV.

We investigated whether the commonly used vaccine adjuvant, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) could augment the ISV regimen consisting of combination RT and ICI. MATERIALS/METHODS: We used syngeneic murine models of melanoma (B78) and prostate cancer (Myc-CaP). Tumor-bearing mice received either RT (12 Gy, day 1), RT+anti-CTLA-4 (C4, day 3, 6, 9), MPL (20 \u00b5g IT injection days 5, 7, 9), RT+C4+MPL, or PBS control. To evaluate the effect of MPL on the irradiated tumor microenvironment, primary tumor with tumor draining lymph nodes were harvested for immune cell infiltration analysis and cytokine profiling, and serum was collected for analysis of antitumor antibody populations. RESULTS: Combination RT+C4+MPL significantly reduced tumor growth, increased survival and complete response rate compared with RT+C4 in both B78 and Myc-CaP models. MPL favorably toward macrophage and Th1 TBET+CD4+ T cell polarization. Furthermore, MPL significantly intratumoral of several models, and polarized CD4 cells toward Th1 phenotype. MPL treatment significantly increased production of Th1-associated, IgG2c antitumor antibodies, which were required for and predictive of antitumor response to RT+C4+MPL, and enabled macrophage-mediated antibody-dependent direct tumor cell killing by MPL-stimulated macrophages. Macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing was dependent on FcR expression. In metastatic models, RT and MPL generated a systemic antitumor immune response that augmented response to ICIs. This was dependent on macrophages and CD4+ but not CD8+T cells. CONCLUSIONS: We report the potential for MPL to augment the ISV effect of combination RT+C4 through FcR, macrophage, and TBET+CD4+ Th1 cell dependent mechanisms. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing generation of a CD8+ T cell-independent, Th1 polarized, systemic antitumor immune response with subsequent generation of immunologic memory. These findings support the potential for vaccine adjuvants to enhance the efficacy of in situ tumor vaccine approaches.

To overcome this, we develop a multifunctional nanoparticle composed of polylysine, iron oxide, and CpG (PIC) to increase tumor antigen presentation, increase the ratio of M1:M2 tumor-associated macrophages, and enhance stimulation of a type I interferon response in conjunction with RT. In syngeneic immunologically \"cold\" murine tumor models, the combination of RT, PIC, and ICB significantly improves tumor response and overall survival resulting in cure of many mice and consistent activation of tumor-specific immune memory. Combining RT with PIC to elicit a robust in situ vaccine effect presents a simple and readily translatable strategy to potentiate adaptive anti-tumor immunity and augment response to ICB or potentially other immunotherapies.

We recently described an effective combination radio-immunotherapy treatment regimen ( c ombination a daptive- i nnate immunotherapy r egimen targeting adaptive and innate immunity in 9464D-GD2, an immunologically cold model of neuroblastoma. Here, we characterize the mechanism of CAIR and the role of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) in the treatment response. METHODS: Mice bearing GD2-expressing 9464D-GD2 tumors were treated with beam radiotherapy, hu14.18-IL2 immunocytokine, CpG, anti-CD40, and anti-CTLA4) and tumor growth and survival were tracked. Depletion of specific immune cell lineages, as well as testing in immunodeficient R2G2 mice, were used to determine the populations necessary for treatment efficacy. Induction of MHC-I expression in 9464D-GD2 cells in response to interferon- (IFN-) and CAIR was measured in vitro and in vivo, respectively, by flow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR. A cell line with IFN--inducible MHC-I expression (9464D-GD2-I) was generated by transfecting a subclone of the parental cell line capable of expressing MHC-I with GD2 synthase and was used in vivo to assess the impact of MHC-I expression on responsiveness to CAIR. RESULTS: CAIR cures some mice bearing small (50 mm3) but not larger (100 mm3) 9464D-GD2 tumors and these cured mice develop weak memory responses against tumor rechallenge. Early suppression of 9464D-GD2 tumors by CAIR does not require T or natural killer (NK) cells, but eventual tumor cures are NK cell dependent. Unlike the parental 9464D cell line, 9464D-GD2 cells have uniformly very low MHC-I expression at baseline and fail to upregulate expression in response to IFN-. In contrast, 9464D-GD2-I upregulates MHC-I in response to IFN- and is less responsive to CAIR. CONCLUSION: Treatment with CAIR cures 9464D-GD2 tumors in a NK cell dependent manner and induction of MHC-I by tumors cells was associated with decreased efficacy. These results demonstrate that the early tumor response to this regimen is T and NK cell independent, but that NK cells have a role in generating lasting cures in the absence of MHC-I expression by tumor cells. Further strategies to better inhibit tumor outgrowth in this setting may require further NK activation or the ability to engage alternative immune effector cells.

Surgical resection with R0 margins is the primary curative treatment for most localized STS. In this setting, radiation therapy is used either pre-operatively or post-operatively to reduce the rate of local recurrence. Modern pre- or post-operative radiation therapy rely on the use of MRI sequences to guide target delineation during treatment planning. MRI-guided radiotherapy also offers unique advantages over CT-guided approaches in differentiating STS from surrounding normal soft tissues and enabling better identification of target volumes on daily imaging. For patients with unresectable STS, radiation therapy may offer the best chance for local tumor control. However, most STS are relatively radioresistant with modest rates of local control achieved using conventionally fractionated radiation. Specialized techniques such as hypofractionated radiation may allow for dose intensification and may increase rates of local control for STS. In these settings, MRI becomes even more critical for the delineation of targets and organs at risk and management of tumor and organ at risk motion during and between radiotherapy treatment fractions.

Immunologically \"cold\" tumors, which are typically less responsive to immunotherapy, are characterized by few tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), low mutation burden, and limited neoantigen expression. Radiation therapy (RT) can change the tumor microenvironment (TME) of an immunologically \"cold\" tumor. This study investigated the effect of combining RT with the in situ vaccine CpG+OX40 in immunologically \"cold\" tumor models. METHODS: (A20 lymphoma, B78 melanoma or 4T1 breast cancer) were treated with combinations of local RT, CpG, and/or OX40, and response to treatment was monitored. Flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiments were conducted to study differences in the TME, secondary lymphoid organs, and immune activation after treatment. RESULTS: An in situ vaccine regimen of CpG+OX40, which was effective in the A20 model, did not significantly improve tumor response or survival in the \"cold\" B78 and 4T1 models, as tested here. In both models, treatment with RT prior to CpG+OX40 enabled a local response to this in situ vaccine, significantly improving the anti-tumor response and survival compared to RT alone or CpG+OX40 alone. RT increased OX40 expression on tumor infiltrating CD4+ non-regulatory T cells. RT+CpG+OX40 increased the ratio of tumor-infiltrating effector T cells to T regulatory cells and significantly increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation in the tumor draining lymph node (TDLN) and spleen. CONCLUSION: RT significantly improves the local anti-tumor effect of the in situ vaccine CpG+OX40 in immunologically \"cold\", solid, murine tumor models where RT or CpG+OX40 alone fail to stimulate tumor regression.

The feasibility of a qMRI method known as magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) for rapid T1 and T2 mapping was a low-field MR-linac system. METHODS: A three-dimensional MRF radiotherapy system. MRF-derived measurements of T1 and T2 were compared to those obtained with gold standard single spin echo methods, and the impacts of the radiofrequency field homogeneity and scan times ranging between 6 and 48 min were analyzed by acquiring between 1 and 8 spokes per time point in a standard quantitative system phantom. The short-term repeatability of MRF was assessed over three measurements taken over a 10-h period. To evaluate transferability, MRF measurements were acquired on two additional MR-guided radiotherapy systems. Preliminary human volunteer studies were performed. RESULTS: The phantom benchmarking studies showed that MRF is capable of mapping T1 and T2 values within 8% and 10% of gold standard measures, respectively, at 0.35T. The coefficient of variation of T1 and T2 estimates over three repeated scans was < 5% over a broad range of relaxation times. The T1 and T2 times derived using a single-spoke MRF acquisition across three scanners were near unity and mean percent errors in T1 and T2 estimates using the same phantom were < 3%. The mean percent differences in T1 and T2 as a result of truncating the scan time to 6 min over the large range of relaxation times in the system phantom were 0.65% and 4.05%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The technical feasibility and accuracy of MRF on a low-field MR-guided radiation therapy device has been demonstrated. MRF can be used to measure accurate T1 and T2 maps in three dimensions from a brief 6-min scan, offering strong potential for efficient and reproducible qMRI for future clinical trials in functional plan adaptation and tumor/normal tissue response assessment.

Here we present studies on the safety and feasibility of this approach in a relevant translational companion dog model (n = 17 dogs) with advanced cancer. METHODS: The three component of the combination immuno-radiotherapy approach were employed either separately or in combination in companion dogs with advanced stage cancer. In situ vaccination was achieved through the administration of hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy and intratumoral hu14.18-IL2 fusion immunocytokine injections to the index tumor. In situ vaccination was subsequently combined with targeted radionuclide therapy using a theranostic pairing of IV 86Y-NM600 (for PET imaging and subject-specific dosimetry) and IV 90Y-NM600 (therapeutic radionuclide) prescribed to deliver an immunomodulatory 2 Gy dose to all metastatic sites in companion dogs with metastatic melanoma or osteosarcoma. In a subset of dogs, immunologic parameters preliminarily assessed. RESULTS: The components of the immuno-radiotherapy combination were well tolerated either alone or in combination, resulting in only transient low grade (1 or 2) adverse events with no dose-limiting events observed. In subject-specific dosimetry analyses, we observed 86Y-NM600 tumor:bone marrow absorbed-dose differential uptakes 2 in 4 of 5 dogs receiving the combination, which allowed subsequent safe delivery of at least 2 Gy 90Y-NM600 TRT to tumors.

Systemic administration of receptor-targeted radionuclide therapy has the potential to selectively deliver radionuclides to multiple tumors throughout the body in metastatic settings. By triggering immunologic cell death and increasing the immune susceptibility of surviving tumor cells in these locations, targeted radionuclide therapies may overcome resistance to ICIs and render immunologically \"cold\" tumors throughout the body responsive to ICIs and immunologically \"hot\". Here, we show the anti-tumor cooperation of targeted -particle radionuclide therapy (-TRT) and ICIs Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R)-targeted radiopeptide [212Pb]VMT01 was employed to deliver -radiation to melanoma tumors in mice. A single injection of 4.1 MBq [212Pb]VMT01 significantly slowed the tumor growth of B16-F10 melanoma and the combination of [212Pb]VMT01 and ICIs induced a cooperative anti-tumor effect leading to 43% complete tumor response with no sign of malignancy on autopsy. Animals with complete response developed anti-tumor immunity to reject further tumor inoculations. This therapeutic cooperation was completely abolished in RAG1 KO mice, which are deficient in T-cell maturation. In addition, the anti-tumor cooperation was compromised when fractionated [212Pb]VMT01 was used in the combination.

We hypothesized that delivering radiation to all tumor sites could augment response to immunotherapies. We tested an approach to enhance response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) by using targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) to deliver radiation semiselectively to tumors. NM600, an alkylphosphocholine analog that preferentially accumulates in most tumor types, chelates a radioisotope and semiselectively delivers it to the TME for therapeutic or diagnostic applications. Using serial 86Y-NM600 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we estimated the dosimetry of 90Y-NM600 in immunologically cold syngeneic murine models that do not respond to ICIs alone. We observed strong therapeutic efficacy and reported optimal dose (2.5 to 5 gray) and sequence for 90Y-NM600 in combination with ICIs. After combined treatment, 45 to 66% of mice exhibited complete response and tumor-specific T cell memory, compared to 0% with 90Y-NM600 or ICI alone. This required expression of STING in tumor cells. Combined TRT and ICI activated production of proinflammatory cytokines in the TME, promoted tumor infiltration by and clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells, and reduced metastases. In mice bearing multiple tumors, combining TRT with moderate-dose (12 gray) external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) targeting a single tumor augmented response to ICIs compared to combination of ICIs with either TRT or EBRT alone. The safety of TRT was confirmed in a companion canine study. Low-dose TRT represents a translatable approach to promote response to ICIs for many tumor types, regardless of location.

Further, the sudden shutdown of core facilities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented work stoppage. In these and other research settings, a robust and reliable means of cryopreservation of immune samples is required. We evaluated different fixation and cryopreservation protocols of disaggregated tumor cells with the aim of identifying a protocol for subsequent flow cytometry of the thawed sample, which most accurately reflects the flow cytometric analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment of a freshly disaggregated and analyzed sample. Cohorts of C57BL/6 mice bearing B78 melanoma tumors were evaluated using dual lymphoid and myeloid immunophenotyping panels involving fixation and cryopreservation at three distinct points during the workflow. Results demonstrate that freezing samples after all staining and fixation are completed most accurately matches the results from noncryopreserved equivalent samples. We observed that cryopreservation of living, unfixed cells introduces a nonuniform alteration to PD1 expression. We confirm the utility of our cryopreservation protocol by comparing tumors treated with in situ tumor vaccines, analyzing both fresh and cryopreserved tumor samples with similar results.

Bempegaldesleukin (BEMPEG) is an investigational CD122-preferential IL-2 prolonged in vivo half-life and preferential intratumoral expansion of T effector cells over T regulatory cells. BEMPEG has shown encouraging safety and efficacy in clinical trials when used in combination with PD-1 checkpoint blockade. In this study, we investigated the antitumor effect of local RT combined with BEMPEG in multiple immunologically 'cold' tumor models. Additionally, we asked if ICB could further enhance the local and distant antitumor effect of RT+BEMPEG in the setting of advanced solid tumors or metastatic disease. METHODS: Mice bearing flank tumors (B78 melanoma, 4T1 breast cancer, or MOC2 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma) were treated with combinations of RT and immunotherapy (including BEMPEG, high-dose IL-2, anti()-CTLA-4, and -PD-L1). injected intravenously with B16 melanoma cells to mimic metastatic disease and were subsequently treated with RT and/or immunotherapy. Tumor growth and survival were monitored. Peripheral T cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were assessed via flow cytometry. RESULTS: A cooperative antitumor effect was observed in all models when RT was combined with BEMPEG, and RT increased IL-2 receptor expression on peripheral T cells. This cooperative interaction was associated with increased IL-2 receptor expression on peripheral T cells following RT. In the B78 melanoma model, RT+BEMPEG resulted in complete tumor regression in the majority of mice with a single ~400 mm3 tumor. This antitumor response was T-cell dependent and supported by long-lasting immune memory. Adding ICB to RT+BEMPEG strengthened the antitumor response and cured the majority of mice with a single ~1000 mm3 B78 tumor. In models with with B16 metastasis, 4T1, and MOC2), the triple combination of RT, BEMPEG, and ICB significantly improved primary tumor response and survival. CONCLUSION: The combination of local RT, BEMPEG, and ICB cured mice with advanced, immunologically cold tumors and distant metastasis in a T cell-dependent manner, suggesting this triple combination warrants clinical testing.

The most obvious requirements for prudent implementation of local therapies like stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SAbR) to become mainstream in treating oligometastases are (1) Clear guidance as to what particular patients might benefit, and (2) Confirmation of improvements in outcome after such treatments via clinical trials. These future directional requirements are non-negotiable. However, innovation and research offer many more opportunities to understand and improve therapy. Identifying candidates and personalizing their therapy can be afforded via proteomic, genomic and epigenomic characterization techniques. Such molecular profiling along with liquid biopsy opportunities will both help select best therapies and facilitate ongoing monitoring of response. Technologies both to find targets and help deliver less-toxic therapy continue to improve and will be available in the marketplace. These technologies include molecular-based imaging (eg, PET-PSMA), FLASH ultra-high dose rate platforms, Grid therapy, PULSAR adaptive dosing, and MRI/PET guided linear accelerators. Importantly, a treatment approach beyond oligometastastic could evolve including a rationale for using SAbR in the oligoprogressive, oligononresponsive, oligobulky and oligolethal settings as well as expansion beyond oligo- toward even plurimetastastic disease. In any case, lessons learned and experiences required by the implementation of using SAbR in oligometastatic cancer will be revisited.

Radiotherapy remains a commonly used cancer treatment modality and can augment immunotherapeutic responses through multiple mechanisms. Recent preclinical studies may provide insight on how to optimally combine radiation and immunotherapies to maximize treatment efficacy. Unique aspects of the brain tumor microenvironment may play a critical role in limiting the successful application of immunotherapies in this location. Emerging studies suggest that such limits may be redressed through combination of immunotherapies with radiation therapy.

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) activates a type 1 interferon (IFN1) response mediated via stimulator of interferon genes (STING), and this is critical to its therapeutic interaction with immune checkpoint blockade. However, little is known about the time course of IFN1 activation after EBRT or whether this may be induced by decay of a TRT source. Methods: We examined the IFN1 response and expression of immune susceptibility markers in B78 and B16 melanomas and MOC2 head and neck cancer murine models using qPCR and western blot. For TRT, we used 90Y chelated to NM600, an alkylphosphocholine analog that exhibits selective uptake and retention in tumor cells including B78 and MOC2. Results: We observed significant IFN1 activation in all cell lines, with peak activation in B78, B16, and MOC2 cell lines occurring 7, 7, and 1 days, respectively, following RT for all doses. This effect was STING-dependent. Select IFN response genes remained upregulated at 14 days following RT. IFN1 activation following STING agonist treatment in vitro was identical to RT suggesting time course differences between cell lines were mediated by STING pathway kinetics and not DNA damage susceptibility. In vivo delivery of EBRT and TRT to B78 and MOC2 tumors resulted in a comparable time course and magnitude of IFN1 activation. In the MOC2 model, the combination of 90Y-NM600 and dual checkpoint blockade therapy reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival compared to single agent therapy and cumulative dose equivalent combination EBRT and dual checkpoint blockade therapy. Conclusions: We report the time course of the STING-dependent IFN1 response following radiation in multiple murine tumor models. We show the potential of TRT to stimulate IFN1 activation that is comparable to that observed with EBRT and this may be critical to the therapeutic integration of TRT with immunotherapies.

Primary tumor size, mouse survival, and metastatic disease at the time of death were assessed. Flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, and cytokine analyses were performed on tumor specimens. All mice treated with RT or surgical resection of primary tumor alone succumbed to metastatic disease, and all mice treated with BEMPEG and/or anti-CTLA-4 succumbed to primary tumor local progression. The combination of primary tumor RT or resection and BEMPEG and anti-CTLA-4 reduced spontaneous metastasis and improved survival without any noted toxicity. Flow cytometric immunoprofiling of primary tumors revealed increased CD8 T and NK cells and decreased T-regulatory cells with the combination of BEMPEG, anti-CTLA-4, and RT compared to RT alone. Increased expression of genes associated with tumor cell immune susceptibility, immune cell recruitment, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte activation were observed in tumors of mice treated with BEMPEG, anti-CTLA-4, and RT. The combination of BEMPEG and anti-CTLA-4 with primary tumor RT or resection enabled effective control of local and metastatic disease in a preclinical murine NSCLC model. This therapeutic combination has important translational potential for patients with early-stage NSCLC and other cancers.

This study was prompted after two experimenters performing virtually identical studies obtained different results when syngeneic B78 murine melanoma cells were implanted into the skin overlying the flank and treated with an in situ vaccine (ISV) immunotherapy. Although both experimenters thought they were using identical technique, we determined that one was implanting the tumors intradermally (ID) and the other was implanting them subcutaneously (SC). Though the baseline in vivo immunogenicity of tumors can depend on depth of their implantation, the response to immunotherapy as a function of tumor depth, particularly in immunologically 'cold' tumors, has not been well studied. The goal of this study was to evaluate the difference in growth kinetics and response to immunotherapy between identically sized melanoma tumors following ID versus SC implantation. We injected C57BL/6 mice with syngeneic B78 melanoma cells either ID or SC in the flank. When tumors reached 190-230 mm3, they were grouped into a 'wave' and treated with our previously published ISV regimen (12 Gy local external beam radiation and intratumoral hu14.18-IL2 immunocytokine). Physical examination demonstrated that ID-implanted tumors were mobile on palpation, while SC-implanted tumors became fixed to the underlying fascia. Histologic examination identified a critical fascial layer, the panniculus carnosus, which separated ID and SC tumors. SC tumors reached the target tumor volume significantly faster compared with ID tumors. Most ID tumors exhibited either partial or complete response to this immunotherapy, whereas most SC tumors did not. Further, the 'mobile' or 'fixed' phenotype of tumors predicted response to therapy, regardless of intended implantation depth. These findings were then extended to additional immunotherapy regimens in four separate tumor models. These data indicate that the physical 'fixed' versus 'mobile' characterization of the tumors may be one simple method of ensuring homogeneity among implanted tumors prior to initiation of treatment. Overall, this short report demonstrates that small differences in depth of tumor implantation can translate to differences in response to immunotherapy, and proposes a simple physical examination technique to ensure consistent tumor depth when conducting implantable tumor immunotherapy experiments.

Advances in radiation delivery techniques allow hypofractionated delivery of conformal radiotherapy. Hypofractionation or other modifications of standard fractionation may improve radiation's ability to promote immune responses to tumors. Other novel delivery options may also affect immune responses, including T-cell activation and tumor-antigen presentation changes. However, there is limited understanding of the immunological impact of hypofractionated and unique multifractionated radiotherapy regimens, as these observations are relatively recent. Hence, these differences in radiotherapy fractionation result in distinct immune-modulatory effects. Radiation oncologists and immunologists convened a virtual consensus discussion to identify current deficiencies, challenges, pitfalls and critical gaps when combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy and making recommendations to the field and advise National Cancer Institute on new directions and initiatives that will help further development of these two fields.This commentary aims to raise the awareness of this complexity so that the need to study radiation dose, fractionation, type and volume is understood and valued by the immuno-oncology research community. Divergence of approaches and findings between preclinical studies and clinical trials highlights the need for evaluating the design of future clinical studies with particular emphasis on radiation dose and fractionation, immune biomarkers and selecting appropriate end points for combination radiation/immune modulator trials, recognizing that direct effect on the tumor and potential abscopal effect may well be different. Similarly, preclinical studies should be designed as much as possible to model the intended clinical setting. This article describes a conceptual framework for testing different radiation therapy regimens as separate models of how radiation itself functions as an immunomodulatory 'drug' to provide alternatives to the widely adopted 'one-size-fits-all' strategy of frequently used 8 Gy\u00d73 regimens immunomodulation.

In a murine melanoma model, we previously showed that an in situ vaccination (ISV) regimen, combining radiation treatment and intratumoral (IT) injection of immunocytokine (IC: anti-GD2 antibody fused to IL2), along with the immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-CTLA-4, robustly eliminates peripheral flank tumors but only has modest effects on co-occurring intracranial tumors. In this study, we investigated the ability of low-dose radiation to the brain to potentiate anti-tumor immunity against a brain tumor when + anti-CTLA-4. B78 (GD2+, immunologically \"cold\") melanoma tumor cells were implanted into the flank and the right striatum of the brain in C57BL/6 mice. Flank tumors (50-150 mm3) were treated following a previously optimized ISV regimen [radiation (12 Gy \u00d7 1, treatment day 1), IT-IC (50 \u00b5g daily, treatment days 6-10), and anti-CTLA-4 (100 \u00b5g, treatment days 3, 6, 9)]. Mice that additionally received whole-brain radiation treatment (WBRT, 4 Gy \u00d7 1) on day 15 demonstrated significantly increased survival compared to animals that received ISV + anti-CTLA-4 alone, WBRT alone or no treatment (control) (P < 0.001, log-rank test). Timing of WBRT was critical, as WBRT administration on day 1 did not significantly enhance survival compared to ISV + anti-CTLA-4, suggesting that the effect of WBRT on survival might be mediated through immune modulation and not just direct tumor cell cytotoxicity. Modest increases in T cells (CD8+ and CD4+) and monocytes/macrophages (F4/80+) but no changes in FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), were observed in brain melanoma tumors with addition of WBRT (on day 15) to ISV + anti-CTLA-4. Cytokine multiplex revealed distinct changes in both intracranial melanoma and contralateral normal brain with addition of WBRT (day 15) to ISV + anti-CTLA-4, with notable significant changes in pro-inflammatory LIX/CXCL5) as chemokines (e.g., IP-10/CXCL10 and MIG/CXCL9). We tested the ability of the alkylphosphocholine analog, NM600, to deliver immunomodulatory radiation to melanoma brain as targeted radionuclide (TRT). Yttrium-86 (86Y) chelated to NM600 was delivered intravenously by tail vein to mice harboring flank and brain melanoma tumors, and PET imaging demonstrated specific accumulation up to 72 h at each tumor site (12:1 brain tumor/brain and 8:1 flank tumor/muscle). When NM600 was chelated to therapeutic -particle-emitting 90Y and administered on treatment day 13, T-cell infiltration and cytokine profiles were altered in melanoma brain tumor, like that observed for WBRT. Overall, our results demonstrate that addition of low-dose radiation, timed appropriately with ISV administration to tumors outside the brain, significantly increases survival in animals co-harboring melanoma brain tumors. This observation has potentially important translational implications as a treatment strategy for increasing the response of tumors in the brain to systemically administered immunotherapies.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The design of the prototype consists of an outer tube and an inner syringe tube that can be filled with injectable agent. The outer sheath and inner syringe tube were constructed using polytetrafluoroethylene tubing, and the other components were 3D printed using dental resin and polylactic acid material. To demonstrate functionality, we injected in vitro phantoms with dyed saline. For proof of concept, we demonstrated the potential for the prototype to deliver cell therapy, enhance tumor delineation, deliver tattoo ink for pathology marking, avoid toxicity through local delivery of chemotherapy, and facilitate combination brachytherapy and immunotherapy. RESULTS: The prototype enables accurate injection in vitro and in vivo without altering dosimetry. To illustrate the potential for delivery of cell therapies, we injected luciferase-expressing splenocytes and confirmed their delivery with bioluminescence imaging. To demonstrate feasibility of radiographically visualizing injected material, we delivered iohexol contrast intratumorally and confirmed tumor retention using Faxitron x-ray imaging. In addition, we show the potential of intratumoral administration to reduce toxicity associated with cyclophosphamide compared with systemic administration. To demonstrate feasibility, we treated tumor-bearing mice with brachytherapy (192Ir source, 2 Gy to 5 mm) in combination with intratumoral injection of 375,000 U of interleukin 2 and observed no increased toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that a prototype multipurpose brachytherapy catheter enables accurate intratumoral injection and support the feasibility of combining intratumoral injection with brachytherapy.

However, the immunologic interactions between cetuximab and radiation therapy are not well understood. We transduced two syngeneic murine HNSCC tumor cell lines to express human EGFR (MOC1- and MOC2-huEGFR) in order to facilitate evaluation of the immunologic interactions between radiation and cetuximab. Cetuximab was capable of inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in MOC1- and MOC2-huEGFR cells but showed no effect on the viability or radiosensitivity of these tumor cells, which also express muEGFR that is not targeted by cetuximab. Radiation enhanced the susceptibility of MOC1- and MOC2-huEGFR to ADCC, eliciting a type I interferon response and increasing expression of NKG2D ligands on these tumor cells. Co-culture of splenocytes with cetuximab and MOC2-huEGFR cells resulted in increased expression of IFN in not only NK cells but also in CD8+ T cells, and this was dependent upon splenocyte expression of FcR. In MOC2-huEGFR tumors, combining radiation and cetuximab induced tumor growth delay that required NK cells, EGFR expression, and FcR on host immune cells. Combination of radiation and cetuximab increased tumor infiltration with NK and CD8+ T cells but not regulatory T cells. Expression of PD-L1 was increased in MOC2-huEGFR tumors following treatment with radiation and cetuximab. Delivering anti-PD-L1 antibody with radiation and cetuximab improved survival and resulted in durable tumor regression in some mice. Notably, these cured mice showed evidence of an adaptive memory response that was not specifically directed against huEGFR. These findings suggest an opportunity to improve the treatment of HNSCC by combining radiation and cetuximab to engage an innate anti-tumor immune response that may prime an effective adaptive immune response when combined with immune checkpoint blockade. It is possible that this approach could be extended to any immunologically cold tumor that does not respond to immune checkpoint blockade alone and for which a tumor-specific antibody exists or could be developed.

Radiobiology is fundamental to a mechanistic understanding of the therapeutic capacity of these agents and their potential toxicities. However, the field of radiobiology has historically focused on external beam radiation. Critical differences exist between TRT and external beam radiotherapy with respect to dosimetry, dose rate, linear energy transfer, duration of treatment delivery, fractionation, range, and target volume. These distinctions simultaneously make it difficult to extrapolate from the radiobiology of external beam radiation to that of TRT and pose considerable challenges for preclinical and clinical studies investigating TRT. Here, we discuss these challenges and explore the current understanding of the radiobiology of radiopharmaceuticals.

This response may neutralize the therapeutic mAb, interfere with mAb effector function or cause toxicities. We investigated the potential influence of ADA to modify the tumor-binding capability of a tumor-reactive 'immunocytokine' (IC), namely, a fusion protein (hu14.18-IL2) consisting of a humanized, tumor-reactive, anti-GD2 mAb genetically linked to interleukin 2. We characterize the role of treatment delivery of IC (intravenous vs intratumoral) on the impact of ADA on therapeutic outcome following IC treatments in an established antimelanoma (MEL) regimen involving radiotherapy (RT) +IC. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were injected with human IgG or the hu14.18-IL2 IC to develop a mouse anti-human antibody (MAHA) response (MAHA+). In vitro assays were performed to assess ADA binding to IC using sera from MAHA+ and MAHA- mice. In vivo experiments assessed the levels of IC bound to tumor in MAHA+ and MAHA- mice, and the influence of IC route of delivery on its ability to bind to B78 (GD2+) MEL tumors. RESULTS: MAHA is inducible in C57BL/6 mice. In vitro assays show that MAHA is capable of inhibiting the binding of IC to GD2 antigen on B78 cells, resulting in impaired ADCC mediated by IC. When B78-bearing mice are injected intravenously with IC, less IC binds to B78-MEL tumors in MAHA+ mice than in MAHA- mice. In contrast, when IC is injected intratumorally in tumor-bearing mice, the presence of MAHA does not detectibly impact IC binding to the tumor. Combination therapy with RT+IT-IC showed improved tumor regression compared with RT alone in MAHA+ mice. If given intratumorally, IC could be safely readministered in tumor-bearing MAHA+ mice, while intravenous injections of IC in MAHA+ mice caused severe toxicity. Histamine levels were elevated in MAHA+ mice compared with MAHA- mice after reintroduction of IC. CONCLUSIONS: Intratumoral injection may be a means of overcoming ADA neutralization of therapeutic activity of tumor-reactive mAbs or ICs and may reduce systemic toxicity, which could have significant translational relevance.

This combined treatment resulted in 71% complete and durable regression of 5-week tumors, a tumor-specific memory T cell response, and augmented response to systemic anti-CTLA-4 antibody checkpoint blockade. While the ability of radiation to diversify anti-tumor T cell response has been reported, we hypothesize that mice rendered disease-free (DF) by a RT-based ISV might also exhibit a heightened B cell response. C57BL/6 mice were engrafted with 2 \u00d7 106 GD2+ B78 MEL and treated at a target tumor size of ~200 mm3 with 12 Gy RT, IT-IC on day (D)6-D10, and anti-CTLA-4 on D3, 6, and 9. Serum was collected via facial vein before tumor injection, before treatment, during treatment, after becoming DF, and following rejection of subcutaneous 2 \u00d7 106 B78 MEL re-challenge on D90. demonstrated the presence of tumor-specific IgG in sera from mice rendered DF and rejecting re-challenge with B78 MEL at D90 after starting treatment. Consistent with an adaptive endogenous anti-tumor humoral memory response, these anti-tumor antibodies bound to B78 cells and parental B16 cells (GD2-), but not to the unrelated syngeneic Panc02 or Panc02 GD2+ cell lines. We evaluated the kinetics of this response and observed that tumor-specific IgG was consistently detected by D22 after initiation of treatment, corresponding to a time of rapid tumor regression. The amount of tumor-specific antibody binding to tumor cells (as measured by flow MFI) did not correlate with host animal prognosis. Incubation of B16 MEL cells in DF serum, vs. na\u00efve serum, prior to IV injection, did not delay engraftment of B16 metastases and showed similar overall survival rates. B cell depletion using anti-CD20 or anti-CD19 and anti-B220 did not impact the efficacy of ISV treatment. Thus, treatment with RT + IC + anti-CTLA-4 results in adaptive anti-tumor humoral memory response. This endogenous tumor-specific antibody response does not appear to have therapeutic efficacy but may serve as a biomarker for an anti-tumor T cell response.

We previously established an in situ vaccination (ISV) regimen combining radiation and immunocytokine to enhance response to ICIs. Here, we tested whether ISV inhibits the development of brain metastases the right flank of C57BL/6 mice. After 3-4 weeks, primary tumors were treated with ISV (radiation (12 Gy, day 1), -GD2 immunocytokine (hu14.18-IL2, days 6-10)) and ICI (-CTLA-4, days 3, 6, 9). Complete response (CR) was defined as no residual tumor observed at treatment day 90. Mice with CR were tested for immune memory by re-engraftment with B78 in the left flank and then the brain. To test ISV efficacy against metastases, tumors were also engrafted in the left flank and brain of previously untreated mice. Tumors were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and multiplex cytokine assay. immune memory and rejection of B78 engraftment in the brain in 11 of 12 mice. When B78 was engrafted in brain prior to treatment, ISV+-CTLA-4 increased survival compared with ICI alone. ISV+-CTLA-4 eradicated left flank tumors but did not elicit CR at brain sites when tumor cells were engrafted in brain prior to ISV. ISV+-CTLA-4 increased CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in flank and brain tumors compared with untreated mice. Among ISV + -CTLA-4 treated mice, left flank tumors showed increased CD8+ infiltration and CD8+:FOXP3+ ratio compared with brain tumors. Flank and brain tumors showed minimal differences in expression of immune checkpoint receptors/ligands or Mhc-1. Cytokine productions were similar in left flank and brain tumors in untreated mice. Following ISV+-CTLA-4, production of immune-stimulatory cytokines was greater in left flank compared with brain tumor grafts. CONCLUSION: ISV augmented response to ICIs in murine melanoma brain and extracranial tumor sites. Although baseline tumor-immune microenvironments were similar at brain and extracranial tumor sites, response to ISV+-CTLA-4 was divergent with reduced infiltration and activation of immune cells in brain tumors. Additional therapies may be needed for effective antitumor immune response against melanoma brain metastases.

Immunogenic cell death and phenotypic changes in tumor cells surviving radiation may underlie this effect and contribute to the capacity of radiation to elicit an in situ tumor vaccine effect. In situ vaccination is a therapeutic strategy that seeks to convert a patient's own tumor into a source of enhanced antigen recognition for the purpose of augmenting a systemic anti-tumor immune response. Capitalizing on the in situ vaccine effect of radiation, several groups have demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy in preclinical models by combining radiation with immune checkpoint blockade. Local delivery of immune adjuvants and/or immune stimulatory cytokines via direct injection into the radiated tumor microenvironment may further increase the in situ vaccine capacity of radiation therapy. However, recent studies suggest that in some contexts this effect is antagonized by the presence of distant untreated sites of disease that may dampen the systemic immune response generated by in situ vaccination through a phenomenon termed concomitant immune tolerance. Concomitant immune tolerance may be overcome by delivering radiation to all sites of metastatic disease, however this is often not possible to safely achieve using external beam radiation therapy without considerable risk of lymphopenia that would negate the immune effects of in situ vaccination. For patients with widespread metastatic disease, alternative strategies may include systemic treatment with targeted radionuclide therapies alone or in combination with an external beam radiation therapy-based in situ vaccine approach.

Epub 2020 Apr 23. - [More](#) The development of immunotherapy in oncology builds upon many years of scientific investigation into the cellular mechanics underlying interactions between tumor cells and immune cell populations. The past decade has brought an accelerating pace to the clinical investigation of new immunotherapy agents, particularly in the setting of metastatic disease. The integration of immunotherapy into phase 3 clinical trial design has lagged in settings of advanced locoregional disease, where combination with radiation therapy may be critical. Yet, such may be the settings where immunotherapies have their greatest potential to affect patient survival and achieve curative outcomes. In this review, we discuss the interaction of radiation with the immune system and the potential to augment antitumor immunity through combined-modality approaches that integrate radiation and immunotherapies. The dynamics of cellular and tumor response to radiation offer unique opportunities for beneficial interplay with immunotherapy that may go unrecognized with conventional screening and monotherapy clinical testing of novel pharmaceutical agents. Using immune checkpoint blockade as a primary example, we discuss recent preclinical and clinical studies that illustrate the potential synergy of such therapies in combination with radiation, and we highlight the potential clinical value of such interactions. For various immunotherapy agents, their greatest clinical effect may rest in combination with radiation, and efforts to facilitate systematic investigation of this approach are highly warranted.

Epub 2020 - [More](#) PURPOSE: We analyzed whole transcriptome sequencing in tumors from 23 patients with stage III or IV melanoma from a pilot trial of the anti-GD2 immunocytokine, hu14.18-IL2, to identify predictive immune and/or tumor biomarkers in patients with melanoma at high risk for recurrence. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients were randomly assigned to receive the first of three monthly courses of hu14.18-IL2 immunotherapy either before (Group A) or after (Group B) complete surgical resection of all known diseases. Tumors were evaluated by histology and whole transcriptome sequencing. RESULTS: Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) levels directly associated with relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in resected tumors from Group A, where early responses to the immunotherapy agent could be assessed. TIL levels directly associated with a previously reported immune signature, which associated with RFS and OS, particularly in Group A tumors. In Group A tumors, there were decreased cell-cycling gene RNA transcripts, but increased RNA transcripts for repair and growth genes. We found that outcome (RFS and OS) was directly associated with several immune signatures and immune-related RNA transcripts and inversely associated with several tumor growth-associated transcripts, particularly in Group A tumors.

CONCLUSIONS: We interpret these data to signify that both immunologic and tumoral cell processes, as measured by RNA-sequencing analyses detected shortly after initiation of hu14.18-IL2 therapy, are associated with long-term survival and could potentially be used as prognostic biomarkers in tumor resection specimens obtained after initiating neoadjuvant | PMC:PMC7334053 | DOI:10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-3294 View details for [PubMedID 32152202](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32152202) - - Combined innate and adaptive immunotherapy overcomes resistance of immunologically cold syngeneic murine neuroblastoma to inhibition of cancer Voeller J, Erbe AK, Slowinski J, Rasmussen K, Carlson PM, Hoefges A, VandenHeuvel S, Stuckwisch A, Wang X, Gillies SD, Patel RB, Farrel A, Rokita JL, Maris J, Hank JA, Dec 6;7(1):344. doi: 10.1186/s40425-019-0823-6. - [More](#) BACKGROUND: Unlike some adult cancers, most pediatric cancers are considered immunologically cold and generally less responsive to immunotherapy. While immunotherapy has already been incorporated into standard of care treatment for pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, overall survival remains poor. In a mouse melanoma model, we found that radiation and tumor-specific immunocytokine generate an in situ vaccination response in syngeneic mice bearing large tumors. Here, we tested whether a novel immunotherapeutic approach utilizing radiation and immunocytokine together with innate immune stimulation could generate a potent antitumor response with immunologic memory were treated with radiation and immunotherapy (including anti-GD2 immunocytokine with or without anti-CTLA-4, CpG and anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody). Tumor growth, animal survival and immune cell infiltrate were analyzed in the tumor microenvironment in response to various treatment regimens. RESULTS: NXS2 had a moderate tumor mutation burden (TMB) while N-MYC driven 9464D-GD2 had a low TMB, therefore the latter served as a better model for high-risk neuroblastoma (an immunologically cold tumor). Radiation and immunocytokine induced a potent in situ vaccination response against NXS2 tumors, but not in the 9464D-GD2 tumor model. Addition of checkpoint blockade with anti-CTLA-4 was not effective alone against 9464D-GD2 tumors; inclusion of CpG and anti-CD40 achieved a potent antitumor response with decreased T regulatory cells within the tumors and induction of immunologic memory. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that a combined innate and adaptive immunotherapeutic approach can be effective against immunologically cold syngeneic murine neuroblastoma. Further testing is needed to determine how these concepts might translate into development of more effective immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of clinically high-risk neuroblastoma.

Epub 2019 Sep 16. - [More](#) Neoantigens induced by random mutations and specific to an individual's cancer are the most important tumor antigens recognized by T cells. Among immunologically \"cold\" tumors, limited recognition of tumor neoantigens results in the absence of a de novo antitumor immune response. These \"cold\" tumors present a clinical challenge as they are poorly responsive to most immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Radiation therapy (RT) can enhance immune recognition of \"cold\" tumors, resulting in a more diversified antitumor T-cell response, yet RT alone rarely results in a systemic antitumor immune response. Therefore, a multifunctional bacterial membrane-coated nanoparticle (BNP) composed of an immune activating PC7A/CpG polyplex core coated with bacterial membrane and imide groups to enhance antigen retrieval is developed. This BNP can capture cancer neoantigens following RT, enhance their uptake in dendritic cells (DCs), and facilitate their cross presentation to stimulate an antitumor T-cell response. In mice bearing syngeneic melanoma or neuroblastoma, treatment with BNP+RT results in activation of DCs and effector T cells, marked tumor regression, and tumor-specific antitumor immune memory. This BNP facilitates in situ immune recognition of a radiated tumor, enabling a novel personalized approach to cancer immunotherapy using off-the-shelf therapeutics.

Methods: Mice bearing flank tumors (representative of lung, pancreatic, prostate, liver, skin, and lymphoid cancers) were injected intravenously with 9.25 MBq of 86Y-NM600 and imaged longitudinally over 4-5 d using small-animal PET/CT. Percentage injected activity per gram (%IA/g) for each volume of interest was measured at each time point for the organs of interest. Mice were euthanized after the final time point, and the tumor and organs of interest were counted with an automatic -counter. Absorbed doses delivered by 90Y-NM600 per injected activity (Gy/MBq) were estimated. Mice bearing B78 flank tumors were injected with a prescription of 90Y-NM600 that delivered 2.5 Gy of absorbed tumor dose and was compared with an equivalent absorbed dose delivered via external-beam radiotherapy using tumor volume as a measure of response. Histology and complete blood counts were analyzed in na\u00efve C57BL/6 mice that were injected with 9.25 MBq of 90Y-NM600 at 5, 10, and 28 d after injection. Results: PET imaging showed consistent tumor accumulation and retention across all tumor models investigated, with little off-target retention of NM600 except in the liver, as is characteristic of hepatobiliary metabolism. The tumor uptake was highest in the pancreatic and lymphoid cancer models, reaching peak concentrations of 9.34 \u00b1 2.66 %IA/g (n = 3) and 9.10 \u00b1 0.13 %IA/g (n = 3), respectively, at approximately 40-48 h after injection. These corresponded to tumor dose estimates of 2.72 \u00b1 0.33 Gy/MBq and 2.67 \u00b1 0.32 Gy/MBq, respectively. In the toxicity study, there were no visible signs of acute toxicity by histology, and perturbation of hematologic parameters was transient when observed, returning to pretherapy levels after 28 d. Conclusion: NM600 is a theranostic agent with a unique ability to selectively target a variety of cancer types, presenting a unique opportunity for PET image-guided targeted radionuclide therapy and combination with immunotherapies.

We implemented a theranostic approach employing a tumor-targeting alkylphosphocholine (NM600) radiolabeled 90Y for targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) of T-cell NHL. PET imaging and biodistribution performed in mouse models of T-cell NHL showed in vivo selective tumor uptake and retention of 86Y-NM600. An initial toxicity assessment examining complete blood counts, blood chemistry, and histopathology of major organs established 90Y-NM600 safety. Mice bearing T-cell NHL tumors treated with 90Y-NM600 experienced tumor growth inhibition, extended survival, and a high degree of cure with immune memory toward tumor reestablishment. 90Y-NM600 treatment was also effective against disseminated tumors, improving survival and cure rates. Finally, we observed a key role for the adaptive immune system in potentiating a durable anti-tumor response to TRT, especially in the presence of microscopic disease.

However, little is known about the extent to which these potential remedies are used internationally to treat the most common toxicities of radiation therapy. We report on the results of an international survey that assessed the use of CAMs. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Surveys were distributed to 1174 practicing radiation oncologists. Questions evaluated the perceptions of CAMs and specific practice patterns for the use of CAM remedies in the treatment of common radiation-induced toxicities (eg, skin, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and mucositis/xerostomia). The responses were compared between the groups using the 2 test and stratified on the basis of provider location, number of years in practice, and perception of CAMs. RESULTS: A total of 114 radiation oncologists from 29 different countries completed the survey, with a balanced distribution between North American (n = 56) and non-North American (n = 58) providers. Among the responding clinicians, 63% recommended CAMs in their practice. The proportion of clinicians who recommend CAMs for radiation toxicities did not significantly vary when stratified by provider's number of years in practice (P = .23) or location (United States/Canada vs other; P = .74). Overall, providers reported that 29.4% of their patients use CAMs, and 87.7% reported that their practice encouraged or was neutral on CAM use, whereas 12.3% recommended stopping CAMs. The most common sources of patient information on CAMs were the Internet (75.4%), friends (60.5%), and family (58.8%). Clinicians reported the highest use of CAMs for radiation skin toxicity at 66.7%, followed by 48.2% for fatigue, 40.4% for nausea, and 36.8% for mucositis/xerostomia. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly two-thirds the surveyed radiation oncologists recommend CAMs for radiation-related toxicities; however, they estimated that less than one third of patients use CAMs for this purpose. This suggests a need for further investigation and perhaps greater patient education on the roles of CAMs in treating radiation toxicities.

Radiation therapy may be a particularly well-suited partner for many immunotherapies. By modulating immune tolerance and functional immunogenicity at a targeted tumor site, radiation therapy may serve as a method of in situ tumor vaccination. In situ tumor vaccination is a therapeutic strategy that seeks to convert a patient's own tumor into a nidus for enhanced presentation of tumor-specific antigens in a way that will stimulate and diversify an antitumor T cell response. The mechanisms whereby radiation may impact immunotherapy are diverse and include its capacity to simultaneously elicit local inflammation, temporary local depletion of suppressive lymphocyte lineages, enhanced tumor cell susceptibility to immune response, and immunogenic tumor cell death. Emerging data suggest that each of these mechanisms may display a distinct dose-response profile, making it challenging to maximize each of these effects using external beam radiation. Conversely, the highly heterogenous and conformal dose distribution achieved with brachytherapy may be optimal for enhancing the immunogenic capacity of radiation at a tumor site while minimizing off-target antagonistic effects on peripheral immune cells. Here, we review the immunogenic effects of radiation, summarize the clinical rationale and data supporting the use of radiation together with immunotherapies, and discuss the rationale and urgent need for further preclinical and clinical investigation specifically of brachytherapy in combination with immunotherapies. Harnessing these immunomodulatory effects of brachytherapy may offer solutions to overcome obstacles to the efficacy of immunotherapies in immunologically \"cold\" tumors while potentiating greater response in the context of immunologically \"hot\" tumors.

Epub 2018 May 10. - [More](#) In situ vaccination is an emerging cancer treatment strategy that uses local therapies to stimulate a systemic antitumor immune response. We previously reported an in situ vaccination effect when combining radiation (RT) with intratumor (IT) injection of tumor-specific immunocytokine (IC), a fusion of tumor-specific antibody and IL2 cytokine. In mice bearing two tumors, we initially hypothesized that delivering RT plus IT-IC to the \"primary\" tumor would induce a systemic antitumor response causing regression of the \"secondary\" tumor. To test this, mice bearing one or two syngeneic murine tumors of B78 melanoma and/or Panc02 pancreatic cancer were treated with combined external beam RT and IT-IC to the designated \"primary\" tumor only. Primary and secondary tumor response as well as animal survival were monitored. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR were used to quantify tumor infiltration with regulatory T cells (Treg). Transgenic \"DEREG\" mice or IgG2a anti-CTLA-4 were used to transiently deplete tumor Tregs. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we observed that the presence of an untreated secondary tumor antagonized the therapeutic effect of RT + IT-IC delivered to the primary tumor. We observed reciprocal tumor specificity for this effect, which was circumvented if all tumors received RT or by transient depletion of Tregs. Primary tumor treatment with RT + IT-IC together with systemic administration of Treg-depleting anti-CTLA-4 resulted in a renewed in situ vaccination effect. Our findings show that untreated tumors can exert a tumor-specific, Treg-dependent, suppressive effect on the efficacy of in situ vaccination and demonstrate clinically viable approaches to overcome this effect. Untreated tumor sites antagonize the systemic and local antitumor immune response to an in situ vaccination regimen. This effect is radiation sensitive and may be mediated by tumor-specific regulatory T cells harbored in the untreated tumor sites.

However, systematic research efforts are being made to facilitate individualised radiation dose prescriptions on the basis of gene-expressssion profiles that reflect the radiosensitivity of tumour and normal tissue. This advance in precision radiotherapy should complement those benefits made in precision cancer medicine that use molecularly targeted agents and immunotherapies. The personalisation of cancer therapy, predicated largely on genomic interrogation, is facilitating the selection of therapies that are directed against driver mutations, aberrant cell signalling, tumour microenvironments, and genetic susceptibilities. With the increasing technical power of radiotherapy to safely increase local tumour control for many solid tumours, it is an opportune time to rigorously explore the potential benefits of combining radiotherapy with molecular targeted agents and immunotherapies to increase cancer survival outcomes. This theme provides the basis and foundation for this American Society for Radiation Oncology guideline on combining radiotherapy with molecular targeting and immunotherapy agents.

We hypothesized that RT triggers transcriptional-mediated changes in tumor expression of immune susceptibility markers at delayed time points, which may explain these previously observed time-dependent effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the time course of changes in expression of immune susceptibility markers following in vitro or in vivo RT in B78 murine melanoma cytometry and immunoblot revealed time-dependent increases in expression of death receptors and T cell co-stimulatory/co-inhibitory ligands following RT in murine and human melanoma. Using high-throughput qPCR, we observed comparable time courses of RT-induced transcriptional upregulation for multiple immune susceptibility markers. We confirmed analogous changes in B78 tumors irradiated in vivo. We observed upregulated expression of DNA damage response markers days prior to changes in immune markers, whereas phosphorylation of the STAT1 transcription factor occurred concurrently with changes following RT. CONCLUSION: This study highlights time-dependent, transcription-mediated changes in tumor immune susceptibility marker expression following RT. These findings may help in the design of strategies to optimize sequencing of RT and immunotherapy in translational and clinical studies.

We assessed the readability of online patient education materials found on academic radiation oncology department Web sites to determine whether they adhered to guidelines suggesting that information be presented at a sixth-grade reading level. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Association of American Medical Colleges Web site was used to identify all academic radiation oncology departments in the United States. One-third of these department Web sites were selected for analysis using a random number generator. Both general information on radiation therapy and specific information regarding various radiation modalities were collected. To test the hypothesis that the readability of these online educational materials was written at the recommended grade level, a panel of 10 common readability tests was used. A composite grade level of readability was constructed using the 8 readability measures that provide a single grade-level output. RESULTS: A mean of 5605 words (range, 2058-12,837) from 30 department Web sites was collected. Using the composite grade level score, the overall mean readability level was determined to be 13.36 (12.83-13.89), corresponding to a collegiate reading level. This was significantly higher than the target sixth-grade reading level (middle school, t (29) = 27.41, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Online patient educational materials from academic radiation oncology Web sites are significantly more complex than recommended by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Health and Human Services. To improve patients' comprehension of radiation therapy and its role in their treatment, our analysis suggests that the language used in online patient information should be simplified to communicate the information at a more appropriate level.

We used a panel of readability analyses to assess OPI from NCI-Designated Cancer Center (NCIDCC) Web sites. METHODS: Cancer.gov was used to identify 68 NCIDCC Web sites from which we collected both general OPI and OPI specific to breast, prostate, lung, and colon cancers. This text was analyzed by 10 commonly used readability tests: the New Dale-Chall Readability Formula, Flesch Reading Ease scale, Flesch-Kinaid Grade Level, FORCAST scale, Fry Readability Graph, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook test, Gunning Frequency of Gobbledygook index, New Fog Count, Raygor Readability Estimate Graph, and Coleman-Liau Index. We tested the hypothesis that the readability of NCIDCC OPI was written at the sixth grade level. Secondary analyses were performed to compare readability of OPI between comprehensive and noncomprehensive centers, by region, and to OPI produced by the American Cancer Society (ACS). RESULTS: A mean of 30,507 words from 40 comprehensive and 18 noncomprehensive NCIDCCs was analyzed (7 nonclinical and 3 without appropriate OPI were excluded). Using a composite grade level score, the mean readability score of 12.46 (ie, college level: 95% CI, 12.13-12.79) was significantly greater than the target grade level of 6 (middle-school: P<.001).

Because of such mechanisms, it was hypothesized that these medications might affect the tumor response to neoadjuvant radiation in patients with rectal cancer. METHODS: One hundred fifteen patients who were treated with neoadjuvant radiation at the University of Wisconsin (UW) between 1999 and 2012 were identified. Univariate analyses were performed with anonymized patient data. In a second independent data set, 186 patients with rectal cancer who were treated with neoadjuvant radiation at the Queen's Medical Center of the University of Hawaii (UH) between 1995 and 2010 were identified. These data were independently analyzed as before. Multivariate analyses were performed with aggregate data. RESULTS: Among patients taking ACEIs/ARBs in the UW data set, a significant 3-fold increase in the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy (52% vs 17%, P = .001) was observed. This finding was confirmed in the UH data set, in which a significant 2-fold-increased pCR rate (24% vs 12%, P = .03) was observed. Identified patient and treatment characteristics were otherwise balanced between patients taking and not taking ACEIs/ARBs. No significant effect was observed on pCR rates with other medications, including statins, metformin, and aspirin. Multivariate analyses of aggregate data identified ACEI/ARB use as a strong predictor of pCR (odds ratio, 4.02; 95% confidence interval, 2.06-7.82; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidental use of ACEIs/ARBs among patients with rectal cancer is associated with a significantly increased rate of pCR after neoadjuvant treatment.

Epub 2016 May 6. - [More](#) Interest in combining radiotherapy and immune checkpoint therapy is growing rapidly. In this study, we explored a novel combination of this type to augment antitumor immune responses in preclinical murine models of melanoma, neuroblastoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Cooperative effects were observed with local radiotherapy and intratumoral injection of tumor-specific antibodies, arising in part from enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). We could improve this response by combining radiation with intratumoral injection of an IL2-linked tumor-specific antibody (termed here an immunocytokine), resulting in complete regression of established tumors in most animals associated with a tumor-specific memory T-cell response. Given the T-cell response elicited by combined local radiation and intratumoral immunocytokine, we tested the potential benefit of adding this treatment to immune checkpoint blockade. In mice bearing large primary tumors or disseminated metastases, the triple-combination of intratumoral immunocytokine, radiation, and systemic anti-CTLA-4 improved primary tumor response and animal survival compared with combinations of any two of these three interventions. Taken together, our results show how combining radiation and intratumoral immunocytokine in murine tumor models can eradicate large tumors and metastases, eliciting an in situ vaccination effect that can be leveraged further by T-cell checkpoint blockade, with immediate implications for clinical evaluation.

Epub 2015 Oct 22. - [More](#) PURPOSE: The purpose of this project was to survey radiation oncology chief residents to define their residency experience and readiness for independent practice. METHODS AND MATERIALS: During the academic years 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015, the Association of Residents in Radiation Oncology (ARRO) conducted an electronic survey of post-graduate year-5 radiation oncology residents in the United States during the final 3 months of training. Descriptive statistics are reported. RESULTS: Sixty-six chief residents completed the survey in 2013 to 2014 (53% response rate), and 69 completed the survey in 2014 to 2015 (64% response rate). Forty to 85% percent of residents reported inadequate exposure to high-dose rate and low-dose rate brachytherapy. Nearly all residents in both years (>90%) reported adequate clinical experience for the following disease sites: breast, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, head and neck, and lung. However, as few as 56% reported adequate experience in lymphoma or pediatric malignancies. More than 90% of residents had participated in retrospective research projects, with 20% conducting resident-led prospective clinical trials and 50% conducting basic science or translational projects. Most chief residents reported working 60 or fewer hours per week in the clinical/hospital setting and performing fewer than 15 hours per week tasks that were considered to have little or no educational value. There was more than 80% compliance with Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) work hour limits. Fifty-five percent of graduating residents intended to join an established private practice group, compared to 25% who headed for academia. Residents perceive the job market to be more competitive than previous years. CONCLUSIONS: This first update of the ARRO chief resident survey since the 2007 to 2008 academic year documents US radiation oncology residents' experiences and conditions over a 2-year period. This analysis may serve as a valuable tool for those seeking to improve training of the next generation of oncology leaders.

Epub 2015 Aug 7. - [More](#) PURPOSE: To conduct a survey of radiation oncologists in India, to better understand specific educational needs of radiation oncology in India and define areas of collaboration with US institutions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A 20-question survey was distributed to members of the Association of Indian Radiation Oncologists and the Indian Brachytherapy Society between November 2013 and May 2014. RESULTS: We received a total of 132 responses. Over 50% of the physicians treat more than 200 patients per day, use 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional treatment planning techniques, and approximately 50% use image guided techniques. For education needs, most respondents agreed that further education in intensity modulated radiation therapy, image guided radiation therapy, stereotactic radiation therapy, biostatistics, and research methods for medical residents would be useful areas of collaboration with institutions in the United States. Other areas of collaboration include developing a structured training module for nursing, physics training, and developing a second-opinion clinic for difficult cases with faculty in the United States. CONCLUSION: Various areas of potential collaboration in radiation oncology education were identified through this survey. These include the following: establishing education programs focused on current technology, facilitating exchange programs for trainees in India to the United States, promoting training in research methods, establishing training modules for physicists and oncology nurses, and creating an Indo-US. Tumor Board. It would require collaboration between the Association of Indian Radiation Oncologists and the American Society for Radiation Oncology to develop these educational initiatives.

Pan-HER represents a novel molecular targeted therapeutic composed of a mixture of six monoclonal antibodies against EGFR, HER2, and HER3. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In the current study, we examine the capacity of Pan-HER to augment radiation response across a series of human lung and head and neck cancers, including EGFR inhibitor-resistant cell lines and xenografts. RESULTS: Pan-HER demonstrates superior antiproliferative and radiosensitizing impact when compared with cetuximab. The mechanisms underlying these effects appear to involve attenuation of DNA damage repair, enhancement of programmed cell death, cell-cycle redistribution, and induction of cellular senescence. Combined treatment of Pan-HER with single or fractionated radiation in human tumor xenografts reveals a potent antitumor and regrowth delay impact compared with Pan-HER or radiation treatment alone. CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight the capacity of Pan-HER to augment radiation response in lung and head and neck cancer models and support investigation of Pan-HER combined with radiation as a promising clinical therapeutic strategy.

The impact of these tumors on overall survival (OS) is poorly understood. Here, we aim to determine whether NSCLC patients with M1a disease due only to a contralateral tumor nodule exhibit a favorable prognosis relative to other M1a or M1b patients. METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of the impact of contralateral tumor nodules on OS in NSCLC stratified by primary tumor size and N stage attained from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. RESULTS: Of 173,640 patients, 5161 M1a-contra patients were identified. Median and 3-year OS for these patients exceeded that of patients with M1b (p < 0.0001) or other M1a disease (p < 0.0001). Primary tumor size and N stage were strongly associated with OS in M1a-contra patients. Three-year OS demonstrated a delayed convergence between M1a-contra and other M1a patients with primary tumors greater than or equal to 3 cm or mediastinal lymph node involvement. Proportional hazard modeling indicated that T1-2N0-1M1a-contra patients exhibit OS not significantly different (p = 0.258) from that predicted with comparable T and N stage disease plus a second early-stage primary. CONCLUSIONS: Contralateral tumors in NSCLC carry a more favorable prognosis than other M1a or M1b disease. Primary tumor size and N stage may help distinguish M1a-contra patients with hematogenous metastasis from those with a synchronous, second primary.

NK cells express a variety of activating and inhibitory receptors that serve to regulate the function and activity of the cells. In the context of targeting cells, NK cells can be \"specifically activated\" through certain Fc receptors that are expressed on their cell surface. NK cells can express FcRIIIA and/or FcRIIC, which can bind to the Fc portion of immunoglobulins, transmitting activating signals within NK cells. Once activated through Fc receptors by antibodies bound to target cells, NK cells are able to lyse target cells without priming, and secrete cytokines like interferon gamma to recruit adaptive immune cells. This antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) of tumor cells is utilized in the treatment of various cancers overexpressing unique antigens, such as neuroblastoma, breast cancer, B cell lymphoma, and others. NK cells also express a family of receptors called killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), which regulate the function and response of NK cells toward target cells through their interaction with their cognate ligands that are expressed on tumor cells. Genetic polymorphisms in KIR and KIR-ligands, as well as FcRs may influence NK cell responsiveness in conjunction with mAb immunotherapies. This review focuses on current therapeutic mAbs, different strategies to augment the anti-tumor efficacy of ADCC, and genotypic factors that may influence patient responses to antibody-dependent immunotherapies.

Radiolabeled CLR1404 enables tumor-specific positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging ((124)I) and targeted delivery of ionizing radiation ((131)I). Here we describe the first preclinical studies of this diapeutic molecule in head and neck cancer (HNC) models. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Tumor-selective distribution of (124)I-CLR1404 and therapeutic efficacy of (131)I-CLR1404 were tested in HNC cell lines and patient-derived xenograft tumor models. Monte Carlo dose calculations and (124)I-CLR1404 PET/CT imaging were used to examine (131)I-CLR1404 dosimetry in preclinical HNC tumor models. studies including patient-derived xenografts demonstrate tumor-selective uptake and retention of (124)I-CLR1404 resulting in a model of highly conformal dose distribution for (131)I-CLR1404. We observe dose-dependent response to (131)I-CLR1404 with respect to HNC tumor xenograft growth inhibition and this effect is maintained together with external beam radiation. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm the utility of CLR1404 for tumor imaging and treatment of HNC. This promising agent warrants further investigation in a developing phase I trial combining (131)I-CLR1404 with reduced-dose external beam radiation in patients with loco-regionally recurrent HNC.

Epub 2014 Aug 11. - [More](#) The development of molecular targeted therapeutics in oncology builds on many years of scientific investigation into the cellular mechanics of malignant transformation and progression. The past two decades have brought an accelerating pace to the clinical investigation of new molecular targeted agents, particularly in the setting of metastatic disease. The integration of molecular targeted agents into phase III clinical trial design has lagged in the curative treatment setting, particularly in combination with established therapeutic modalities such as radiation. In this review, we discuss the interaction of radiation and molecular targeted therapeutics. The dynamics of cellular and tumor response to radiation offer unique opportunities for beneficial interplay with molecular targeted agents that may go unrecognized with conventional screening and monotherapy clinical testing of novel agents. By using epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a primary example, we discuss recent clinical studies that illustrate the potential synergy of molecular targeted agents with radiation and highlight the clinical value of such interactions. For various molecular targeted agents, their greatest clinical impact may rest in combination with radiation, and efforts to facilitate systematic investigation of this approach appear highly warranted.
