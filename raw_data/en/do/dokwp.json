Brief descriptions and digest paragraphs are not offered in substitution of or supplementary to the official titles and official text of the legislative measures. The brief descriptions and digest paragraphs are not intended to constitute any part of the law, are not in any manner adopted or acted upon by the legislature, and are in no way evidence of the intent of the legislature. If the only action on a bill for a session is \"By resolution, reintroduced and retained in present status.\" and no action other than \"By resolution, reintroduced and retained in present status.\" occurs in subsequent sessions in the two-year legislative cycle for that bill, the history for those sessions will not be printed in this publication. Companion bills are shown for original bills only. The brief description for each bill family shows only once on the original bill unless there is a change in the brief description for a later version of the bill.HOW TO USE THE \"LEGISLATIVE DIGEST AND HISTORY OF BILLS\" The Legislative Digest and History of Bills is a joint legislative publication which is published after the final legislative session each year. During the legislative session, a daily Legislative Digest is available. Use the daily Legislative Digest to keep up with the new introductions (including substitute bills) and the amendments to the various measures in between publications of the Legislative Digest and History of Bills . (A \"-S\" or \"-S2\" following the bill number indicates a substitute, e.g., SB 5009-S, HB 1071-S2.) The latest legislative history on the measures is also provided in the Legislative Digest publication. This publication consists of three parts: (1) Digest paragraphs and legislative actions on all measures (bills); (2) RCW - Bill Table; (3) Topical Index; and (4) Session Law Chapter to Bill Table DIGEST PARAGRAPHS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS This portion consists of the following: (1) The summary digest paragraphs and legislative actions on all bills, joint memorials, joint resolutions, concurrent resolutions, and floor resolutions considered by the House or Senate during the legislative session; (2) Summary paragraph and legislative actions on gubernatorial appointments submitted to and being considered by the Senate; (3) The listing of the bills a member has sponsored along with an indication of prime sponsorship; and (4) The special status of legislation reports for the Senate and the House. The bulk of the Legislative Digest and History of Bills is formed by an in-sequence listing of measures. In this listing are included the measure number, the legislative and \"by-request\" sponsors, the latest digest paragraphs, and the bill histories. This portion of the publication is divided into two sections: Senate measures and House measures. Initiatives, bills, joint memorials, joint resolutions, concurrent resolutions, floor resolutions, and gubernatorial appointments are included as measures. Reports on the special status of legislation follow the Senate and House digest history portion of the book. The reports are listed as they become available as legislation progresses down the path toward enactment. A full listing of the reports available in a particular Legislative Digest and History of Bills is found on the Index Page of the Legislative Digest and History of Bills beginning on page one. Several examples of these reports are: (1) Senate Bills Introduced by Members (Prime sponsorship is noted by a bullet (large dot) before the bill number;) (2) Senate Bills Introduced by Request; (3) Senate Bills Passed by the Senate; (4) Senate Bills Passed by the Senate and House; (5) Senate Bills Failed to Pass the House; (6) Senate Bills Passed Both Houses Showing Executive Action; and (7) Governor's Messages on Bills Vetoed or Partially Vetoed VO - Veto overridden PV - Partial Veto V - Veto Comparable reports are supplied for the House Bills. (See Table of Contents for page numbers.) iRCW - BILL TABLE The Legislative Digest and History of Bills contains a table which lists the statutes being affected by the current bills. This table is widely used by legislative drafters as well as all other attorneys concerned with the legislative process. The \"S\" found preceding the bill numbers in this table means that the bill being referred to is the substitute version. All first substitutes are noted by an \"S\" preceding the bill number; second, third, etc., are noted by 2S, 3S, Number Table\" lists in code section number order the sections in the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) that are the subject matter of current legislation. The action the bill takes on the section is listed with the following abbreviations: ADD (adding a new section or section to a code chapter or code title), AMD (amending), DECD (decodifying), RECD REP (repealing). It is especially useful in the closing days of the session to determine whether a code section currently under consideration by the legislature may already have been repealed or amended during the session, in which event the earlier action must be taken in cognizance. In addition to being included in the Legislative Digest and History of Bills, an electronic version of this table is available at Washington State Legislative website. The URL to the website is http://www.leg.wa.gov, choose Bill Info and then RCW to Bill Table. The symbols on the table indicate whether the amended section or the new section has passed the legislature or has been signed into law or vetoed by the Governor. A \"p\" following the bill number means that the legislature has passed the bill. An asterisk (\"*\") means that executive action or inaction has been recorded upon the bill during the first year of the two-year legislative cycle. A plus sign (\"+\") means that executive action or inaction has been recorded upon the bill during the second year of the two-year legislative cycle. Generally, the \"*\" and \"+\" mean that the Governor has signed the bill into law with or without a partial veto. TOPICAL INDEX The Topical Index is at the end of the Legislative Digest and History of Bills . The Topical Index entries are entered soon after the bills are introduced on the floor, so that researchers can search the text of the index for measures related to their issue. Various symbols are found in the index which aid in determining the type of measures to which the index entry refers. The table of abbreviated symbols for the Topical Index is found on the page beginning the Topical Index section.

(DIGEST AS ENACTED) Makes a fourth driving under the influence offense a felony. VETO MESSAGE ON SB 5037 May 16, 2017 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 5, Senate Bill No. 5037 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to making a fourth driving under the influence offense a felony.\" Section 5 of this bill increases the $200 fee assessed to alcohol violators by $50. The revenue is used to fund grants to organizations that operate programs to reduce driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This language is nearly identical to Section 13 of Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 1614, which passed on April 21, 2017, and will soon be signed into law. However, Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 1614 includes a provision that a minimum of $300,000 of these grant funds shall support newly established pilot programs for persons with two or more prior offenses in seven years, a preferable approach. For these reasons I have vetoed Section 5 of Senate Bill No. 5037.SB 5037With the exception of Section 5, Senate Bill No. 5037 is approved.

(DIGEST AS ENACTED) Makes transportation appropriations for the 2017-2019 fiscal biennium. VETO MESSAGE ON ESB 5096 May 16, 2017 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as 209(9), 215(6), ACT Relating to transportation funding and appropriations.\" Section 209(9), pages 21-22, Department of Transportation, Toll Operations and Maintenance Section 209(9) directs the Department of Transportation's Toll Operations and Maintenance program to study and report to the legislative transportation committees on the potential of converting two staffed tollbooths on the Tacoma Narrows Bridge to unstaffed. No funding was provided for the study. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 209(9).SB 5095 SB 509634 Legislative Digest and History of BillsSection 215(6), page 27, Department of Transportation, Highway Maintenance Section 215(6) requires the department to create and maintain a separate maintenance budget for the Hood Canal Bridge. The department is not required to maintain separate budgets for other bridges and roads, and this would limit the department's flexibility to manage its budget. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 215(6). Section 306(17), page 43, Department of Transportation, Improvements Section 306(17) creates a new I-5/Exit 274 interchange project in Blaine to be funded with $12,100,000 of Connecting Washington Account-State funds in the 2023-25 biennium. It directs the LEAP transportation document referenced in Section 306(1) to be modified accordingly. The I-5/Exit 274 interchange project in Blaine does not appear in LEAP Transportation Document 2017-1, nor is there any information about project scope. This LEAP transportation document should not be amended for a project without sufficient information about its scope and cost. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 306(17). Section 702, pages 75-76, Settlement Funds Expenditure Section 702 provides a legislative finding that it is appropriate to provide a framework for the administration of mitigation funds provided to the state as a beneficiary of the consent decree entered into between the United States, Volkswagen AG, and other parties that settle emission-related claims for certain models of diesel vehicles (commonly referred as the VW Settlement). Accordingly, the section provides that the omnibus capital budget for the Department of Ecology includes necessary provisions to administer the mitigation funds and development of the mitigation plan. The Legislature has not adopted an omnibus capital budget. Therefore, it is not possible to determine at this time what provisions the final capital budget may contain nor whether such provisions will be acceptable. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 702. I will continue to work with the Legislature to ensure prompt administration of the settlement funds under the terms of the consent decree. I also have directed the departments of Ecology and Transportation to jointly develop the proposed mitigation plan for public comment and submittal to the trustee. Section 705, pages 78-79, DUI Fee Section 705 amends RCW 46.61.5054. This same statute was amended in two other bills--Section 5 of Senate Bill 5037 and Section 13 of Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 1614, which I will sign into law on May 16, 2017. The amendment in Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 1614 renders moot the amendment in Section 705. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 705. Section 1303, page 157, Effective Date of Section 705 Section 1303 enables Section 705 of the transportation budget to take effect if Senate Bill 5037 is enacted by June 30, 2017. Since I am vetoing Section 705, this section is no longer required. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 1303. For these reasons I have vetoed Sections 209(9), 215(6), 306(17), 702, 705, and 1303 of Engrossed 215(6), and 1303, Engrossed 5096 is approved.

VETO MESSAGE ON ESB 5266 May 5, 2017 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval, Engrossed Senate Bill No. 5266 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to theft of rental property.\" Engrossed Senate Bill No. 5266 creates a new criminal offense for a person who fails to return rental or leased property at the expiration of the rental or lease period and, after proper notice, fails to return the property within 72 hours and pay the applicable rental charges which have accrued. I have serious concerns with this approach. The bill has the effect of SB 5265 SB 5266criminalizing debt and would disproportionately affect low- income Washingtonians and their families. These matters could more prudently be handled in a civil setting. For these reasons I have vetoed Engrossed Senate Bill No. 5266 in its entirety.

VETO MESSAGE ON SSB 5779 May 5, 2017 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 7, Substitute Senate Bill No. 5779 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to behavioral health integration in primary care.\" Section 7 of this bill states that subject to appropriation, the Health Care Authority should implement a rate with \"the intention that it will increase the availability of behavioral health services and incentivize adoption of the primary care behavioral health model.\" The section further states that the rate should \"provide increased reimbursement to providers for behavioral health services provided to patients in primary care settings.\" Section 7 is unnecessary because we do not yet know what funding may be required and no budget has identified funding that corresponds to this section of this bill. This section is therefore premature and the agency does not have the capacity to absorb any new potential costs within its current funding.SB 5779-S\"This veto does not impact the substance of the bill. I agree that we must increase access to behavioral health services; this is a priority the state has been deeply engaged in for some time. In addition, while I am vetoing Section 7, I am directing the Health Care Authority once the payment code review is done as required in the substance of the bill, to recommend an appropriate reimbursement rate for providers for this work, and report any projected costs to the appropriate committees of the legislature and myself by October 15, 2017, and submit a decision package for consideration as part of next year's supplemental budget.\" For these reasons I have vetoed Section 7 of Substitute Senate Bill No. 5779.

Revises growth management act provisions regarding the economic development element. VETO MESSAGE ON SSB 5790 May 16, 2017 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 3, Substitute Senate Bill No. 5790 entitled:SB 5789-S SB 5790 SB 5790-SLegislative Digest and History of Bills 275\"AN ACT Relating to the economic development element of the growth management act.\" The Growth Management Act (GMA) provides for a balanced approach between community economic development and the conservation of resource lands, such as farms and forests. Section 3 of this bill undermines that balance by favoring, in certain counties, economic development over the protection of these resource lands. I am committed to supporting economic development across Washington State so all areas and communities thrive. This commitment includes working with legislators and stakeholders on how we better develop the economy of rural and other underserved areas. At the same time, I remain committed to fully supporting the GMA, which has created the framework for thoughtful growth and comprehensive development plans while protecting vital resource lands. During special session, I am willing to consider a more targeted bill that provides some additional flexibility to encourage economic development in rural communities, while maintaining the overall balanced approach within the GMA. Over the interim, it would also be helpful to reexamine how we encourage economic development in rural areas. This would be an appropriate topic for the broader review of the GMA as proposed in the Senate and House budgets. For these reasons I have vetoed Section 3 of Substitute Senate Bill No. 5790. With the exception of Section 3, Substitute Senate Bill No. 5790 is approved.

VETO MESSAGE ON SSB 5883 June 30, 2017 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Sections 103(4); 136(2); 150(8); 207(12); 213(1)(a), page 108, lines 37-39, through page 109, line 2, beginning with \"The Senate Bill No. 5883 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to fiscal matters.\" Section 103(4), pages 4-5, Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee, Evaluation of Market Rate Housing and Subsidized an evaluation and comparison of the cost efficiency of market rate housing in Washington versus publicly subsidized housing projects intended to assist low-income households. The solution to our state's housing crisis is less a comparison between market rate and subsidized housing than it is a comprehensive set of all available options to meet a serious need. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 103(4). Section 136(2), page 37, Department of Revenue, Contract with Sound Transit This subsection requires the Department of Revenue to renegotiate its contract with Sound Transit for the collection of sales tax. The department is required to charge Sound Transit an administrative fee of 1 percent, which is more than is charged under the current contract. This will reduce the funding available for Sound Transit to deliver the voter-approved transit package. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 136(2). Section 150(8), page 48, Consolidated Technology Services Agency, Washington Business Onestop Portal The operating budget does not provide the Consolidated Technology Services Agency with revenue for continuation of this project, and assumes the agency will spend existing fund balance. However, there is not sufficient funding available to spend on this project. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 150(8). Section 207(12), pages 97-99, Department of Social and Health Services, Legislative-Executive WorkFirst Poverty Reduction Oversight Task Force Funding is provided for a legislative-executive WorkFirst poverty reduction oversight task force with the primary goal of reducing the overall percentage of families and individuals living in poverty. However, Section 207(12) provides the task force with oversight of the partner agencies' operations related to the WorkFirst and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. While I agree with the primary goal to reduce intergenerational poverty, this oversight is beyond the scope and authority necessary to develop a comprehensive poverty reduction plan. Therefore, I have vetoed Section 207(12), and I am directing the Department of Social and Health Services to form a workgroup that includes members of the Legislature and appropriate state agencies to develop a plan to address this important issue. Section 213(1)(a), page 108, lines 37-39, through page 109, line 2, beginning with \"The administration\" and ending with \"administrative costs.\", Health Care Authority, Pharmacy Preferred Drug List and Pharmacy Benefit Manager This section requires a substantive change in the administration of the prescription drug benefit by requiring the use of a single pharmacy benefits manager. The remainder of the section is an appropriation that directs the implementation of a preferred drug list and related transparency and reporting requirements. The vetoed language is a distinct, separate subject, constituting a separate section. The constitution prohibits two subjects contained in one bill, and therefore, the budget bill may not contain substantive law. Exercising my constitutional line item veto authority, I am removing this separate pharmacy benefit manager section from the budget bill. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 213(1)(a), page 108, lines 37-39, through page 109, line 2, beginning with \"The administration\" and ending with \"administrative costs.\" Section 217(1), pages 130-131, Department of Labor and Industries, Subminimum Teen Wage This section requires the Department of Labor and Industries to engage in rule making to review the minimum wage for employees under eighteen years of age in light of the enactment of Initiative 1433. In development of the rule, the department Legislative Digest and History of Bills 299must consider several areas of research and have a proposed rule for consideration by December 1, 2017. I-1433 increased Washington State's minimum wage and provided paid sick leave. Low-wage workers, including teen workers, have not been able to keep up with the cost of living even though workers are producing more. Instead of suppressing wages, I am committed to investing in job creation and job opportunities for all workers, including options that provide incentives for employers to hire teen workers and invest in pre- apprenticeship programs. Finally, the Legislature has for the past three years considered reducing wages for workers under age 18, and every effort has failed. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 217(1). Section 217(2), page 131, Department of Labor and Industries, Occupational Disease Study The Department of Labor and Industries is required to conduct a study on occupational disease claims, including where employment is the proximate cause of diseases and conditions that are covered under industrial insurance. The 2011 Legislature directed the department to contract with a research entity to study the frequency and severity of occupational disease claims. The research found that the evidence suggests little reason for concern over Washington's system. The system has adequate checks and balances which ensure that only work-related conditions are compensated. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 217(2). Section 222(4), page 148, Employment Security Department, Center for Workers - King County The Employment Security Department is to contract with a center for workers in King County to provide rapid response services for dislocated workers through state funds from the Administrative Contingency Account. The department has sufficient dedicated federal funds to provide statewide rapid response services, including in King County. This proviso is unnecessary and it limits the department's ability to provide comprehensive statewide services and leverage statewide efficiencies and collaboration. For these reasons, I have vetoed section 222(4). Section 302(2), pages 161-162, Department of Ecology, Burrowing Shrimp Control This subsection requires the Department of Ecology to report on the status of its environmental review and possible issuance of a permit to allow use of the pesticide Imidacloprid to control burrowing shrimp. This subsection also requires Ecology to identify the steps it will take to ensure a viable and economically feasible alternative if the pesticide use is not permitted. Burrowing shrimp is a serious problem for the shellfish industry in Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor. However, the proviso inappropriately presumes the outcome of the environmental review and permitting process. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 302(2). While I am vetoing this subsection, I am directing the Department of Ecology to complete the environmental review process as soon as possible and to keep the Legislature informed of its progress. Section 610(13), page 250, The Evergreen State College, Local Government Study This subsection requires the Washington State Institute for Public Policy (WSIPP) to study comparative constitutional and statutory obligations and revenue capacity of local governments, and provide a report of its research and findings to the Legislature by December 30, 2017. The study is outside the scope of typical research projects performed by WSIPP, and the funding level is insufficient to contract for the work within the short timeline. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 610(13). Section 734, pages 288-289, Transportation, Reductions to Agency Management This section reduces funding for management positions in agencies funded in the transportation budget. This is an unnecessary reduction in funding and would impact the ability of agencies to recruit and retain qualified staff as the state embarks on the largest transportation investment package in Washington history. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 734. Section 964(3), page 329, Law Enforcement Officers' and Firefighters' Retirement System, (LEOFF) Distribution This language expresses the Legislature's intent that future distributions to the Local Law Enforcement Officers' and Firefighters' Retirement System Benefits Improvement Account may include transfers from the LEOFF 2 pension fund. I have consistently vetoed similar provisions in the past, and I remain concerned about the wisdom of such transfers from a retirement fund. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 964(3). Section 1213(1), page 455, lines 6-9, Health Care Authority, General Fund-State and Federal Appropriations The Legislature did not provide the Health Care Authority with sufficient funding for Healthier Washington savings restoration. Without these funds, the Health Care Authority will be unable to close the state fiscal year. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 1213(1), page 455, lines 6 through 9. Because this veto will result in more General Fund-State than is necessary to close the state fiscal year, I am directing the Health Care Authority to place the $6.0 million GF-State appropriation into reserve. For these reasons I have vetoed Sections 103(4); 136(2); 150(8); 207(12); 213(1)(a), page 108, lines 37-39, through page 109, line 2, beginning with \"The 6-9 of Substitute Senate Bill No. 5883. With the exception of Sections 103(4); 136(2); 150(8); 207(12); 213(1)(a), page 108, lines 37-39, through page 109, line 2, beginning with \"The 6-9, Substitute Senate Bill No. 5883 is approved.

VETO MESSAGE ON SSB 5977 July 7, 2017 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen:SB 5977 SB 5977-SI am returning herewith, without my approval as to Sections 201-205 and 601-606, Substitute Senate Bill No. 5977 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to revenue.\" Sections 201 to 205 reduce the general manufacturing business and occupation tax rate and the processing [for] hire rate over four years, beginning in 2019. But at a time when we are asking homeowners to pay more in property taxes to support our children's education, Sections 201 to 205 instead give a tax break to business; and, 21 percent of the revenue from this tax break goes to out-of-state oil companies. This revenue could be used for education, mental health, public safety, and a host of other important public services. Moreover, these tax reductions should be considered in a thoughtful, transparent process that incorporates public input and business accountability. Sections 601 to 606 make sales and use tax exemptions to encourage the conversion of power plants to natural gas or biomass from coal. These sections incentivize a company to do something that it is already required to do by law, giving it an unfair advantage over other Washington companies. For these reasons I have vetoed Sections 201-205 and 601-606 of Substitute Senate Bill No. 5977. With the exception of Sections 201-205 and 601-606, Substitute Senate Bill No. 5977 is approved.

VETO MESSAGE ON ESSB 6032 March 27, 2018 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to ACT Relating to fiscal matters.\" Section 119(8), page 19, Secretary of State, Automatic Voter Registration Study This section includes funding for the Secretary of State to conduct a study related to automatic voter registration. The requirement to do this study was removed from Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill 2595 (automatic voter registration), but the funding proviso remained in the budget. Because the agency will not be doing this study, the funding is not needed. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 119(8).SB 6031-S SB 6032 SB 6032-S346 Legislative Digest and History of BillsSection 129(21), page 56, Office of Financial Management, 2020 Census Funds are provided to the agency for staffing and support to prepare for the 2020 census in two identical provisos: Section 129(19) and Section 129(21). This is clearly a drafting error because funding for the double proviso is not included in the total appropriation authority. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 129(21). Section 135(4), pages 59-60, Department of Revenue, Tax Database The budget provides $150,000 to the department to create a publicly available online searchable database of all taxes and tax rates in the state for each taxing district. This is the same provision that was included in Senate Bill 6590 which had a fiscal note of $1,219,800 for creation of the database. This project cannot be done for the $150,000 provided in the budget. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 135(4). Section 146(10), page 74, Department of Enterprise Services, Capitol Dome Access This section directs the Department of Enterprise Services to allow individuals to access the top of the Capitol dome \"under approved supervision and guidelines developed by the department.\" The Olympia Fire Department has assessed this space in the past, and, among other issues, reported that it could not use a fireman's rescue technique in this space nor could it assist an injured party by using a gurney. The Department of Labor and Industries classifies the area as a \"confined space\" which means that it has restricted entry/exit and is not primarily designed for human occupancy. Access should be authorized only for individuals needed to do work on the dome. While the view is beautiful from the dome, there are too many risks involved with granting access to the public. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 146(10). Section 307, page 261, lines 14-15, Department of Fish and Wildlife, FY 2018 General Fund-State Appropriation The final budget reduces the department's FY 2018 General Fund-State appropriation by $1,739,000. Although the final budget provides an additional $1.5 million for Orca whale recovery efforts, it does not fully cover the costs of important work needed to begin the recovery of this iconic species. To support Orca recovery efforts, I am vetoing this reduction in appropriation and directing the department to use $650,000 of this amount to complete fish screen inventories, conduct public outreach and education, hire a recovery coordinator position, and support facilitation of the Southern Resident Killer Whale Task Force. I also am directing the agency to place the remaining amount in unalloted status. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 307, page 261, lines 14-15. Section 308(21), page 274, Department of Natural Resources, SAFER Grant Match One-time funding of $873,000 General Fund-State is provided to Kittitas County Fire District 7 for matching funds for its Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Despite the merits of the federal grant funding to provide firefighting staff to the district, the state should not provide the local match for these grants. Operational funding for fire districts is a local decision. Not only would providing the match through the state general fund set a precedent, it would be unfair to the other 19 fire districts across the state that were awarded a similar federal grant and provided their own local match. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 308(21).Section 502(1)(h), page 303, Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction for General Apportionment, Net Revenue Hold Harmless Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 6362 contains a more prescriptive hold harmless calculation than the language in the operating budget. The operating budget will hold districts harmless to a baseline that assumes the levy cliff would go into effect--a decision that the Legislature chose last year not to implement. We must ensure that no school district receives less funding in the 2018-19 school year. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 502(1)(h). Section 504(2), page 318, Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction for School Employee Compensation Adjustments, Delay Professional Learning Day The operating budget delays the implementation of state-funded professional learning days by one year. Research shows that time for job embedded professional learning and collaboration is linked to student success. Limiting practices that improve student achievement goes against our goal for a world-class education system. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 504(2). Section 606(23)(b), page 372, The Evergreen State College, Funding Options for the Legislature This proviso allows the Office of Financial Management, State Board for Community and Technical Colleges, and Council of Presidents to use information from a Washington State Institute for Public Policy (WSIPP) study to present funding options to the Legislature. The WSIPP study is related to higher education funding methods in other states. This item directs two separate agencies and the Council of Presidents to perform work that does not naturally fit together with the WSIPP study. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 606(23)(b). Section 908(3), page 417, Law Enforcement Officers' and Firefighters' Retirement System (LEOFF) Distribution This language expresses the Legislature's intent that future distributions to the Local Law Enforcement Officers' and Firefighters' Retirement System Benefits Improvement Account may include transfers from the LEOFF 2 pension fund. I have consistently vetoed similar provisions in the past, and I remain concerned about the wisdom of such transfers from a retirement fund. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 908(3). I am vetoing the following sections related to bills that did not pass the Legislature resulting in the lapse of funding. My veto of these sections will serve to clean up these unnecessary sections of the bill. Section 103(9), page 5, Joint Legislative Audit & Review Committee, SHB 1154, Fishing and Seafood Processing. Section 122(3), page 22, State Treasurer's Office, E2SHB 2718, Civil Forfeiture Proceedings. Section 127(56), page 43, Department of Commerce, ESSB 6081, Net Metering or SHB 2995, Energy.

VETO MESSAGE ON ESSB 6095 March 27, 2018 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as 3011(2), 3011(3), 3011(4), \"AN ACT Relating to the capital budget.\" Sections 3011(2), (3) and (4), page 83, Department of Ecology, Water Availability (91000343) I appreciate the bipartisan effort and support to pass Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6091 (ESSB 6091) and the accompanying appropriation of $20 million in the enacted capital budget. Together, these measures are important in allowing appropriate development to proceed in rural areas of our state while also ensuring the protection of instream flows. Negotiations on ESSB 6091 were both substantial and difficult. Sections 3011(2), (3) and (4) single out particular projects for funding. This is a departure from the planning and implementation processes established only weeks ago in ESSB 6091, and circumvents the Department of Ecology's efforts to prioritize and approve projects. For these reasons, I have vetoed Sections 3011(2), (3) and (4). Section 4002, pages 110-112, Aviation Revitalization Loans (92000003) This section contains amendments identical to Substitute House Bill 1656 (SHB 1656) and reduces the amount available for loans by $2.5 million. Because I have vetoed SHB 1656 and I support the original $5 million appropriation, I have vetoed Section 4002. Section 7018, page 153 Section 7018 repeals Section 13 of Substitute House Bill 1656 (SHB 1656). Because I have vetoed SHB 1656, there is no need to repeal a section in that bill. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 7018.SB 6095 SB 6095-SSection 7019, page 154 Section 7019 directs that Section 7018 takes effect when Substitute House Bill 1656 (SHB 1656) takes effect. Because I have vetoed Section 7018 and SHB 1656, this section is not necessary. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 7019. For these reasons I have vetoed Sections 3011(2), 3011(3), 3011(4), 4002, 7018, and 7019 of Engrossed Substitute the 3011(2), 3011(3), 3011(4), and 7019, Engrossed Substitute No. 6095 is approved.

VETO MESSAGE ON ESSB 6106 March 27, 2018 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval SB BillsSection 208(19), pages 23-24, Department of Licensing, Licensing Services Work Group Section 208(19) directs the department to convene a work group comprised of a county auditor, county licensing manager, and three subagent representatives to assess the current licensing services system and the establishment of a new licensing services partnership committee. The work group must consider and make recommendations on expanding services offered by subagents, establishing voluntary payment plans and automatic renewal options, and reviewing the current financial environment of subagents and county auditors. The department already has a specific licensing committee that meets twice a year. It also meets twice a year with the Washington Association of Vehicle Subagents. In addition, the proviso did not provide funding for this work group. While I encourage looking at ways to improve services to the public, this work group provides a forum for communication that already exists and funding is not provided to support the work group. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 208(19). I am vetoing the following sections related to bills that did not pass the legislature resulting in the lapse of funding. My veto of these sections will serve to clean up these unnecessary sections of the bill.

Research shows that time for job- embedded professional learning and collaboration is linked to student success. Limiting practices that improve student achievement goes against the intent of this bill and our goals. For this reason, I am vetoing Section 402. Section 408 moves forward by one year the requirement for OSPI to develop rules and budgetary procedures to ensure school districts provide separate accounting of state and local revenues to expenditures. The work is underway to design and build the accounting systems required to implement this data transparency within the original timeline for school year 2019-20. Speeding up the development of the system will jeopardize the long-term reliability of the accounting system and suspend the development of all other systems work. For this reason I am vetoing Section 408. For these reasons I have vetoed Sections 402 and 408 of Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill No. 6362. With the exception of Sections 402 and 408, Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill No. 6362 is approved.
