It's obvious that our poor posture and work habits are to be blamed. Neck pain is not a new complaint and is becoming even more common due to our lifestyles.1 However, our habits are not the sole culprit; neck pain might be caused due to an underlying medical condition as well.2 In most cases, the reason for the pain remains unknown.

As they go away, they might come back too. The discomfort and pain may cause you to avoid activities, fearing injury or worsening of the condition.1 Let's not let a pain in the neck disturb our daily activities. Here are some home remedies for neck pain that you can try. The first and foremost home remedy is to apply ice and heat onto the neck. This is very simple to follow. Cold ice, either directly or in an ice bag, should be applied to obtain relief from the stiffness of the neck. For the first two to three days, ice is to be applied; after that, heat can be applied. To apply heat, you may use hot packs, hot compresses or even hot showers.4 PharmEasy Recommends: [Dr.Odin Hot & Cool (Transparent)](https://pharmeasy.in/health-care/products/hot-cool-transparent--3521653) Massaging the neck gives instant relief. You can give this remedy a shot and see for yourself. Any type of massage may be beneficial when the right area is massaged. Finding the painful areas and applying pressure to them is the key. The only thing that we need to keep in mind is to keep the massage movements directed towards the heart. There are chances of heart valves getting damaged if too much pressure is applied in the wrong direction, i.e. away from the heart.4 A few yoga poses and mild stretching exercises can help decrease the tension and ease the stiffness of the neck. A few of the exercises include bringing your ears to your shoulders, squeezing both of your shoulders at the shoulder blades, rotating your shoulders backwards, pushing your head backwards, etc.4 These simple exercises may alleviate your pain, so try them and see if they work for you. Researchers have found that lavender oil used along with acupressure is effective in relieving neck pain.5 You can use lavender oil by diluting it in another carrier oil of your choice and using it to massage the neck gently. Ginger has various medicinal properties. In an animal study, it was found that the extract of dried ginger and dried gingerol-enriched extract were both effective in alleviating pain and inflammation (analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity).6 You can use ginger directly and also include it in your diet. You may use dried ginger powder in food or use ginger oil to apply over your neck. Devil's claw is a plant that is known for its medicinal properties. It is native to South Africa. The part of the plant used for medicinal purposes is the root tuber. It is particularly used for the management of pain. Traditionally devil's claw has been used in the form of decoctions for pain relief.7 It is usually used as tablets, capsules, liquid extracts, or can be used to make tea. The beneficial effects of devil's claw for joint problems and muscle problems (common causes of neck pain) are quite evident, but there is more evidence needed in the form of research and studies. Turmeric, also known as Haldi, and the compounds derived from it have properties that cause the reduction of inflammation (anti-inflammatory property).8 You can use turmeric for neck pain by mixing a little bit of turmeric powder to warm milk and drinking it. You can also make a semisolid paste of it by adding a little water and applying it to the neck. Camphor has been used in the preparation of many balms. It has been in use for ages for the management of pain, especially arthritic pain and muscle pain, which commonly leads to neck pain. The pain-relieving action of camphor is due to its activity in blocking pain receptors. Its action was seen to provide long term pain relief in one of the studies.9 You can use camphor in the form of oil for application over the neck.
