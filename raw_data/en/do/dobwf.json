A healer's role is to bring harmony and peace and balance into one's life. Not only through the touch of our hands, but through empathy and understanding. You are a special person, being a healer. It's a divine calling. It's an incredible power, to be given the gift to heal with our hands, body, and soul. I receive many messages daily on my Haunted, Old and Beautiful by Amanda APS page asking me \"How do I know if I'm a healer?\" So I thought it was about time I share my experiences and thoughts as a healer myself. A spiritual awakening as a healer is one of the most beautiful experiences that we go through in life. Realising our calling on this earth is to help animals and people is rewarding beyond words . Be proud of your calling. Be proud of being a healer. 60 signs you were born a natural healer inside your soul: You are like me: the black sheep of the family. Your family find it difficult to understand you. You feel every emotion around you; it vibrates through to your very core. You feel life so deeply it overwhelms you. You need alone time to heal. Music expresses what's in your soul you have major goosebumps when music is on; music resonates with you very being. Music heals you deeply inside. You don't tolerate nonsense. You're an easy target for narcissistic personalities and their hate campaigns. You love water the ocean especially. You love to walk in nature. You adore and protect animals. You're an empath. You're an enlightened soul. You're a big thinker, and always see things from outside the square box. You can be overwhelmed by public outings. You suffer from depression and anxiety, and you've experienced so many low points in your life that you may feel you are an outcast. You love deeply with all of your being. You take on others emotions to the point it can overwhelm you and make you physically sick (empathy) "}
