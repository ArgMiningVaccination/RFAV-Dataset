While patients with moderate to severe psoriasis are treated using targeted therapies (small molecules and monoclonal antibodies), patients suffering from milder forms are still in need of effective topical products without adverse effects. Antimony compounds (ACs) are regularly used as anti-inflammatory compounds in traditional and anthroposophic medicine and as antiprotozoan drugs. Here, we examined the effect of metallic antimony, natural antimony(III) sulfide and potassium antimonyl(III) tartrate in vitro on psoriasis-like keratinocytes and the human dendritic cell line THP-1 using qPCR, immunocytochemistry, ELISA and flow cytometry. In psoriatic keratinocytes, ACs inhibited the overexpression of the antimicrobial peptide -defensin 2 and glucose transporter 1, as well as the hyperproliferation marker keratin 17. Furthermore, ACs mediated anti-inflammatory effects by reducing nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-B and pSTAT3 and inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by keratinocytes. In addition, ACs displayed anti-psoriatic effects by reducing the activation of IFN--treated THP-1 cells as well as the expression of the psoriasis-promoting master cytokine IL-23 by these cells. While all ACs showed anti-psoriatic effects, the most prominent results were seen with potassium antimonyl(III) tartrate. In summary, ACs display numerous anti-psoriatic effects in vitro at subtoxic concentrations. We conclude that ACs are interesting compounds for the topical treatment of psoriasis that warrant further investigation in clinical studies.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-09-25", "cleaned_text": "is the most common manifestation accounting for about 90% of all cases [ [2](#B2-molecules-26-05814)]. Typical signs are thickened erythematous and scaly plaques of varying size. Histological features include infiltration of the skin with mononuclear inflammatory cells and neutrophil granulocytes, and epidermal hyperplasia with disturbed terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, as expressed by retention of the nucleus in the normally anucleated cells in the stratum corneum (parakeratosis). Psoriasis may cause itching and pain, resulting in psychiatric comorbidities such as depression. [3](#B3-molecules-26-05814)]. This initiates a pro-inflammatory signaling cascade resulting in activation of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells followed by their proliferation and differentiation into different T helper subtypes (TH cells). Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 play a key role in this inflammatory process [ [4](#B4-molecules-26-05814), [5](#B5-molecules-26-05814)]. In response to these factors, different T cell subtypes secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to progression and perpetuation of the disease. These cytokines include IL-22 from TH22 cells as well as by TH17 cells [ [6](#B6-molecules-26-05814), [7](#B7-molecules-26-05814)]. While IL-22 is responsible for the characteristic epidermal hyperplasia and reduced differentiation of keratinocytes accompanied by and activator of transcription-(JAK/STAT) as well as the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) pathway in keratinocytes. This results in the secretion of several pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-6 or IL-8) and the expression of typical psoriasis markers such as keratin 17 (KRT17) or glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) by the keratinocytes. The uncovering of these pathways led to the development of targeted therapies, i.e., monoclonal antibodies against TNF-, IL-12/23, [10](#B10-molecules-26-05814)]. However, biologicals are only used in cases of severe psoriasis while most patients (~90%) suffer from mild to moderate psoriasis. This group is usually treated with topical therapies such as corticosteroid or dithranol, in some cases combined with phototherapy. While the topical substances are effective, their use is limited either because they are not suitable for long-term use due to adverse effects or because safe handling is difficult and often requires inpatient treatment in specialized hospitals. Therefore, outpatients could benefit from new topical treatment options that may replace topical drugs with possible adverse effects. Natural substances used in traditional medicine for the treatment of inflammatory diseases are interesting candidates to potentially take this role. [11](#B11-molecules-26-05814)]. Even today, drugs containing antimony compounds (ACs) are regularly used to treat various diseases. However, in addition to its beneficial effects, antimony uptake can also have detrimental consequences. It plays a role in environmental contamination of drinking water and soil used to grow nutritional plants. Antimony is brought into circulation by the distribution of industrial sewage water, motor vehicle emissions or as a part of pesticides. The concentration of antimony in food and environment is strictly limited, as the oral uptake of higher concentrations, especially in cases of chronic exposure, might lead to detrimental effects to the health of humans. In earlier times, ACs were thought to be carcinogenic. However, carcinogenicity of ACs could not be confirmed with oral uptake, and only very limited evidence exists for carcinogenicity of ACs from inhalation studies in animals [ [12](#B12-molecules-26-05814)]. The limit of the tolerable daily oral uptake of antimony was set to 6 \u00b5g/kg body weight by the World Health Organization. The 'no observed adverse effect level' (NOAEL) is 6 mg/kg body weight. However, as psoriasis in its milder forms mostly affects the skin, topical application could give good results without the risk of adverse effects due to oral uptake. [13](#B13-molecules-26-05814)] or schistosomiasis [ [14](#B14-molecules-26-05814)]. However, ACs are also frequently utilized in anthroposophic and ayurvedic medicine [ [15](#B15-molecules-26-05814), [16](#B16-molecules-26-05814)], for example, to treat diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and inflammatory skin diseases such as rosacea, eczema and psoriasis [ [17](#B17-molecules-26-05814), [18](#B18-molecules-26-05814), [19](#B19-molecules-26-05814)]. However, no clinical or experimental studies have confirmed the efficacy and possible mode of action of ACs in these conditions. The beneficial effects of ACs in these diseases might be mediated by a modulation of pro-inflammatory cell signaling as shown for antimony chloride in T cells at sub-toxic concentrations [ [20](#B20-molecules-26-05814)]. [21](#B21-molecules-26-05814)] but might also be useful in psoriasis. The topical application of ACs can avoid potential adverse effects caused by systemic exposure. [22](#B22-molecules-26-05814)]. A major part of our experiments was performed with in vitro generated psoriasis-like keratinocytes because they initiate and maintain pro-inflammatory signaling in psoriasis and represent the major cell type that causes the clinical phenotype. 2. Results 2.1. Analysis of AC Cytotoxicity [23](#B23-molecules-26-05814)]. To achieve this phenotype, PHKs were treated with a combination of IL-17A, IL-22 and TNF- (Pso). First, we analyzed the cytotoxic potential of the substances by measuring the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release to identify the ideal concentrations for the following experiments measuring LDH release. The tested concentrations ranged from 1 \u00b5M to 500 \u00b5M. As both A and AS are not soluble in any solvent suitable for cell culture, concentrations were limited to this value to exclude a high level of particulate matter in the culture medium that could exert a negative effect on the PHKs. Both A and PAT showed an increase of toxicity with growing concentrations, while AS caused no increase of toxicity in all tested doses ( [Figure 1](#molecules-26-05814-f001)). 2.2. Effect of ACs on Psoriasis Marker Expression [24](#B24-molecules-26-05814), [25](#B25-molecules-26-05814)]. Furthermore, serum levels of BD2 have been shown to be a well suited biomarker for psoriasis [ [26](#B26-molecules-26-05814)]. As shown in [Figure three ACs downregulated the Pso-induced upregulation of DEFB4A expression in a dose-dependent manner. Both A and PAT caused the biggest downregulation of gene expression resulting in a level close to that of unstimulated cells. An effect can already be seen at rather low concentrations of 10-25 \u00b5M. In contrast, reduction upon treatment with AS starts only at 250 \u00b5M, ten times more than A and PAT but still at a lower level of cytotoxicity. [28](#B28-molecules-26-05814)]. The same holds true for Pso-treated keratinocytes that show a prominent reduction of KRT1 expression ( [Figure 2](#molecules-26-05814-f002)b). However, neither A nor AS were able to revert this effect at any of the tested concentrations. In contrast, PAT was able to upregulate KRT1 expression at a concentration of 25 \u00b5M. Using 50 \u00b5M resulted in an expression even above the level of untreated cells, reverting the negative effect of Pso stimulation on the differentiation marker. As already mentioned, hyperproliferation is one of the key characteristics of psoriatic keratinocytes. KRT17 is a protein that has been shown to be a marker for hyperproliferation in these cells and was found to be overexpressed in psoriatic skin [ [29](#B29-molecules-26-05814)]. As already shown by us, Pso treatment upregulated the expression of KRT17, indicating the hyperproliferative phenotype of these cells ( [Figure 2](#molecules-26-05814-f002)c). However, PAT, AS and especially A were able to counteract this effect within the set range of toxicity. While PAT and AS were able to reduce the expression to the level of untreated cells, A caused a reduction even below that level. Keratinocyte proliferation\u2014for example, during inflammation and injury\u2014is critically dependent on glucose. GLUT1 is responsible for efficient transport of glucose across the cell membrane into the cytoplasm. Consequentially, GLUT1 expression was found to be upregulated in psoriatic skin as these cells have an increased need for energy due to the enormous proliferation seen in psoriasis plaques [ [30](#B30-molecules-26-05814)]. In addition, it has been described that GLUT1 expression correlates with disease severity [ [31](#B31-molecules-26-05814)]. In line with these studies, Pso treatment led to an increased expression of GLUT1 in PHKs. However, neither A nor AS were able to reduce GLUT1 expression significantly. While 50 \u00b5M of A showed a tendency towards a reduction, all other concentrations of A and AS even led to a further increased expression. In contrast, 10 \u00b5M of PAT led to a decrease of gene expression even below the value of untreated cells while higher concentrations showed the same amplifying tendency as A and AS. The expression of all genes was not influenced by lactose (data not shown). 2.3. ACs Decrease Inflammation in Psoriasis-like Keratinocytes [32](#B32-molecules-26-05814), [33](#B33-molecules-26-05814)]. Using immunocytochemistry, analyzed in psoriasis-like PHKs. Cytokine treatment led to an increased nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-B. This is visualized by the disappearance of the shadow in the place of the nucleus that can be seen in untreated cells. Due to the nuclear translocation, the staining shows a similar intensity in the nucleus after Pso stimulation ( [Figure 3](#molecules-26-05814-f003)a). In addition, the psoriasis cytokines caused an increased phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3. While untreated cells show no staining for phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3), stimulated cells show a strong staining in the nucleus ( [Figure 3](#molecules-26-05814-f003)b). These findings are confirmed when analyzing the intensity of the staining in the nucleus ( [Figure 3](#molecules-26-05814-f003)c). A 2 h pre-treatment with either A or AS had no significant effect on these processes. Even the highest concentrations of 75 \u00b5M and 500 \u00b5M, respectively, had no visible or measurable difference to Pso-treated cells without pre-treatment. However, PAT was able to reduce the translocation of p65 into the nucleus starting at concentrations of 25 \u00b5M which can be seen in the reduction of nuclear staining. Furthermore, PAT not only decreased pSTAT3 nuclear translocation but also the phosphorylation itself, as seen by the lack of staining throughout the cells and not only the nucleus. Lactose had no effect either on p65 translocation or on STAT3 phosphorylation and translocation (data not shown). [34](#B34-molecules-26-05814), [35](#B35-molecules-26-05814)]. Both cytokines not only increase activation of the keratinocytes themselves, leading to a boost in proliferation, but also contribute to the maintenance of the ongoing inflammation in the skin. We therefore analyzed the effects of A, AS and PAT on the cytokine-induced secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 from PHKs. of Pso-treated cells was set as 100% and the results of the other sample were calculated in comparison. Pso stimulation led to a great increase of the secretion of both IL-6 and IL-8 by PHKs ( [Figure 4](#molecules-26-05814-f004)). While pre-treatment AS resulted in no significant decrease of IL-6 secretion, a tendency towards a reduced secretion especially at the highest pre-treatment doses is recognizable. However, A and PAT were clearly able to reduce IL-6 levels in the cell culture supernatant dose-dependently with the highest effect at 75 \u00b5M or 50 \u00b5M, respectively, reducing IL-6 secretion nearly to the level of untreated cells. Looking at IL-8 levels, A shows no significant effect. There was only a reducing tendency towards the highest dose of 75 \u00b5M. Surprisingly, pre-treatment with AS did not reduce IL-8 secretion but led to an increase of cytokine secretion. Finally, PAT again had the most prominent anti-inflammatory effect by reducing IL-8 secretion to the level of untreated cells at 50 \u00b5M. Again, lactose treatment showed no effect (data not shown). 2.4. ACs Reduce DC Activation and IL-23 Expression [36](#B36-molecules-26-05814)]. Nevertheless, the importance of IFN- in psoriasis pathogenesis is unquestionable as cancer and hepatitis C patients receiving IFN- as therapy have been seen to develop or exacerbate psoriasis upon treatment initiation [ [37](#B37-molecules-26-05814), [38](#B38-molecules-26-05814)]. Plasmacytoid DCs have been shown to be a main producer of IFN- in psoriasis, leading to the activation and maturation of myeloid DCs that produce cytokines leading to activation of T cells [ [39](#B39-molecules-26-05814)]. We therefore analyzed a potential effect of ACs on DC activation. The human monocytic cell line THP-1 is often employed as a surrogate cell line for DCs and was stimulated with IFN- with or without a pre-treatment with ACs and the surface expression of the activation marker CD54 was analyzed using flow cytometry. CD54, also known as ICAM-1, is an intercellular adhesion molecule expressed by a variety of cells. It is especially important in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as DCs, where it is crucial for the formation of the immunological synapse by binding to lymphocyte-function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) expressed by T cells. While DCs in steady state already express certain levels of CD54, surface expression greatly increases upon activation making it a suitable surrogate marker for the activation of DCs (Sheikh und Jones 2008). Both A and AS led to an increased mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD54 in comparison to IFN- stimulation ( [Figure 5](#molecules-26-05814-f005)). However, the highest tested concentration of A showed a tendency towards a reduced MFI. While 10 \u00b5M of PAT also led to a higher CD54 expression, increasing concentrations resulted in a reduced MFI of CD54 with 50 \u00b5M inhibiting CD54 to the level of untreated cells. [5](#B5-molecules-26-05814)] and the success of therapies targeting IL-23, such as the monoclonal antibody ustekinumab, confirms its importance for the pathogenesis of the disease. Therefore, we analyzed potential effects of ACs on the IFN--induced expression of IL-23 in DCs using ICC. Just like in psoriasis, treatment of THP-1 cells with IFN- led to an increased staining in these cells ( [Figure 6](#molecules-26-05814-f006)a). [Figure 6](#molecules-26-05814-f006)b). Once again, PAT was already effective at relatively low concentrations starting at 10 \u00b5M and could reduce IL-23 expression way below the level of untreated cells. Pre-treatment with A resulted in similar reductions of IL-23 expression while AS was only effective at the highest of the tested concentrations. Lactose treatment had no effect on IL-23 expression (data not shown). 3. Discussion [40](#B40-molecules-26-05814)]. While they can temporarily lead to an improvement of the symptoms, adverse effects can limit their use. Long-term treatment with topical corticosteroids can cause skin fragility [ [41](#B41-molecules-26-05814)], while dithranol, especially in combination with other substances such as salicylic acid, can cause chemical burns [ [42](#B42-molecules-26-05814)] and should ideally be applied by trained nursing staff or physicians in an inpatient setting. New therapeutical options that could replace or reduce the use of these drugs are therefore needed. ACs could be such an alternative. Although a carcinogenic potential of ACs has been discussed, cancerogenic effects due to oral uptake of ACs have not been confirmed. A study described an association between the occurrence of lung cancer and chronic antimony inhalation in smelter workers [ [43](#B43-molecules-26-05814)]. However, the authors were critical of their results due to a list of confounders in this type of workplaces. A study analyzing the genotoxic properties of ACs found that the only evidence hinting towards any effect in that direction is the induction of oxidative stress that may lead to DNA damage. However, an in vitro reporter system did not sense DNA damage induced by ACs but found oxidative stress [ [44](#B44-molecules-26-05814)]. Interestingly, oxidative stress through the induction of ROS production is also one of the main modes of action of dithranol [ [45](#B45-molecules-26-05814)]. Dithranol is the most effective topical treatment of psoriasis to date, leading to the death of proliferating keratinocytes as a result of disturbed energy delivery due to interference with mitochondrial function [ [46](#B46-molecules-26-05814)]. [47](#B47-molecules-26-05814)]. Furthermore, psoriasis keratinocytes skin re-differentiated lost their psoriatic phenotype during cell culture [ [48](#B48-molecules-26-05814)]. Therefore, our in vitro psoriasis model using primary keratinocytes isolated from the skin of healthy donors treated with a combination of IL-17A, IL-22 and TNF- provides an interesting substitute model that has already proven its capability [ [23](#B23-molecules-26-05814)]. [23](#B23-molecules-26-05814)]. While its role as an AMP is widely known, BD2 also plays an important role in the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways and immune cells. In psoriasis, it not only enables the complex formation of AMPs with self-nucleotides resulting in the activation of DCs via TLR recognition, but it also acts directly on keratinocytes by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, proliferation and migration [ [49](#B49-molecules-26-05814)]. Its downregulation by ACs is in line with the finding that BD2 is also reduced in patients after anti-IL-17A therapy using secukinumab [ [25](#B25-molecules-26-05814)]. KRT1 is also a gene that was massively downregulated in psoriasis-like PHKs. Interestingly, this not only indicates reduced differentiation in keratinocytes; KRT1 has also been shown to be a crucial player in the maintenance of skin integrity, and its loss or mutation leads to increased levels of IL-18 as well as alarmins such as S100A8 [ [50](#B50-molecules-26-05814)]. A therapy increasing its expression would therefore improve psoriasis. In our setting, PAT, but not A and AS, was able to increase the expression of KRT1. The expression of keratin 17 (KRT17) was also modulated by ACs. KRT17 was downregulated by A and PAT to the level of untreated cells or even below. This was also observed with corticosteroids or dithranol [ [51](#B51-molecules-26-05814), [52](#B52-molecules-26-05814)] indicating a reduction in SCID-hu xenogeneic transplantation model, siRNA-mediated inhibition of KRT17 was shown to reduce typical histological features of psoriasis such as increased epidermal thickness [ [53](#B53-molecules-26-05814)]. This confirms the importance of KRT17 as a target for psoriasis therapy. It is not only important for proliferating keratinocytes but also a target for autoreactive T cells [ [54](#B54-molecules-26-05814), [55](#B55-molecules-26-05814)], partly due to peptide sequence similarities with streptococcal M proteins [ [56](#B56-molecules-26-05814)]. The KRT17-mediated hyperproliferation is a very energy-consuming process for keratinocytes. Associated with increased metabolism, GLUT1 expression is upregulated in these cells [ [30](#B30-molecules-26-05814)]. Inhibiting GLUT1 using ACs might therefore be an option to limit the energy transfer to keratinocytes and reduce proliferation. However, the ability of ACs to reduce GLUT1 expression was rather limited. Only the lowest concentration of PAT was able to cause a significant GLUT1 downregulation while all other doses led to an increased expression. At first glance, this seems to be the opposite of the desired effect of AC treatment. However, the upregulation of GLUT1 expression might indirectly be caused by the effect of ACs on glucose and its catabolism. It has been shown earlier that the effect of ACs against Leishmania tropica is mediated by an inhibition of glucose uptake into the cells [ [57](#B57-molecules-26-05814)], while ACs reduced glycolysis in Schistosoma mansoni [ [58](#B58-molecules-26-05814)]. Given that ACs may have similar effects on mammalian cells, the massive upregulation of GLUT1 expression might be an effort of the keratinocytes to compensate the lack of glucose metabolism. In conclusion, from our experiments, 10 \u00b5M of PAT could be a concentration where the anti-psoriatic effect is already present while inhibition of glucose uptake or metabolism is not present. [32](#B32-molecules-26-05814), [33](#B33-molecules-26-05814)]. Both pathways are activated in our psoriasis-like PHKs after Pso-treatment. While AS has no effect on this activation, A shows a tendency towards an inhibition of the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-B as well as phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3 at higher concentrations. However, PAT showed a great efficiency in reducing the activation of both pathways, even at 25 \u00b5M. These results are again comparable to effects we have seen in cells treated with dithranol. Inhibition of these pathways offers an interesting opportunity to reduce disease severity in psoriasis [ [59](#B59-molecules-26-05814), [60](#B60-molecules-26-05814)]. Besides the inhibition of inflammation, the inhibition of STAT3 can also reduce proliferation of keratinocytes as KRT17 expression is upregulated by IL-17A in an STAT3-dependent mechanism [ [61](#B61-molecules-26-05814)]. It has been shown that the inhibition of NF-B and STAT3 in in psoriasis using ochromycinone [ [63](#B63-molecules-26-05814)] is able to reduce psoriatic skin inflammation. [34](#B34-molecules-26-05814), [35](#B35-molecules-26-05814)]. Both cytokines have been targets in the development of new therapeutical options. There have been studies analyzing potential effects of anti-IL-6/8 therapy. The success of the monoclonal antibody tocilizumab targeting has been overshadowed by the exacerbation of psoriasis in some of the treated patients [ [66](#B66-molecules-26-05814)]. Although both cytokines are important in a broad range of immune functions, their systemic inhibition often results in infections. Therefore, the local reduction of cytokine secretion by topical application of PAT might be advantageous, as PAT was the only AC that reduced the secretion of both IL-6 and IL-8 in Pso-stimulated keratinocytes. This effect of PAT is most probably mediated by the inhibition of NF-B and STAT3 signaling. It was observed within the same concentrations range as with the positive control dithranol in a previous study. Surprisingly, although A did not reduce the nuclear translocation of p65 or pSTAT3, it was able to reduce IL-6 secretion. This might indicate an alternative way of activating IL-6 expression. [67](#B67-molecules-26-05814)]. However, an initial upregulation has also been seen with the soluble PAT. As the concentrations were initially determined in psoriasis-like PHKs, higher levels of ACs might be necessary to achieve effects when using A or AS. [5](#B5-molecules-26-05814)]. The importance of IL-23 in psoriatic inflammation is confirmed by the very high efficacy of therapies targeting this cytokine. Monoclonal antibodies such as the p40 inhibitor of IL-23, guselkumab, tildrakizumab and risankizumab, are very effective in the treatment of severe forms of psoriasis [ [9](#B9-molecules-26-05814), [68](#B68-molecules-26-05814), [69](#B69-molecules-26-05814)]. While all three tested substances were effective in inhibiting IL-23 expression, PAT was the most effective, reducing IL-23 expression even below the level of untreated cells. We conclude that the inhibitory effect of all three ACs on IL-23 expression in IFN--treated THP-1 cells supports the potential of ACs as topical treatment for psoriasis. As a reduction of this key cytokine might be enough to achieve an effect in the treatment of psoriasis, a reduction of the activation status of DCs might not be necessary. [70](#B70-molecules-26-05814)], monocultures of human cells are useful tools for the initial steps in drug development for dermatological disorders. While these models can provide evidence of the mode of action of the investigated substances, they lack the complexity of skin tissue consisting of a variety of cell types. In the human system, the next step would be the use of organotypic skin models or explants from human skin. In addition, testing the ACs in vivo using murine models of psoriasis, induced, for example, by imiquimod or IL-23, could give insight into the effects of ACs in a more physiological setting. The advantage of ACs is that two of them are already used in commercially available ointments containing 0.4% of either A or AS. These products are used in anthroposophic medicine for the treatment of dermatological disorders such as eczema. The 0.4% concentration is well tolerated by patients and could also be used for an initial assessment of the effect of ACs in psoriasis patients. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Antibodies and Reagents 4.2. Cell Culture [71](#B71-molecules-26-05814)]. They were kept in Keratinocyte-SFM medium (Thermo Fisher, Darmstadt, Germany) at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and were passaged regularly before reaching confluence to keep them in a basal/early differentiation state. The cells were used up to passage 5. To generate psoriasis-like PHKs, cells were cells (donor: Cell line services, Eppenheim, Germany, source: BIOSS, of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany) were supplemented with 4 L-glutamine, 50 \u00b5M -mercaptoethanol, 25 mM HEPES and 10% FCS. 4.3. Cell Viability Assay 4.4. RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis and qPCR [27](#B27-molecules-26-05814)] with ACTB as the reference gene. As PHKs were isolated from skin biopsies of different donors, the response to the stimulation varied in its strength due to donor variation. For example, induction of DEFB4A expression by Pso-stimulation ranged from 1209- to 2405-fold and KRT17 expression ranged from 1.4- to 2.9-fold. However, the effects of the ACs always showed similar trends in comparison to those values. To enable better comparison of the results, the expression of Pso-treated cells was set as 100% expression and the results of the other sample were calculated in comparison. 4.5.
