Naturopathic medicine utilizes the same physical exams, patient histories and laboratory tests used by medical doctors to diagnose illness. However, naturopathic doctors differ from other doctors in our approach to healing. We are experts in natural medicine and work in a holistic way to restore and support the body's inherent ability to return to health. Naturopathic doctors are extensively trained to use the least invasive therapies to achieve health with minimal side-effects. Our goal is to find the underlying cause of the illness and remove it. In this way, we do not just mask symptoms but strive to achieve a deep, long-lasting cure. The naturopathic care offered at Natural Health Center includes: Botanical medicine Homeopathic medicine Environmental medicine Nutritional assessment and therapy Annual exams for insurance/work Gynecological exams and PAP smears Well-child exams Laboratory exams, blood testing, imaging Women's health issues, including natural support for PMS and menopause Men's health Natural care for pediatric patients Annual spring cleanse programs/detoxification Natural thyroid management Hydrotherapy Principles of naturopathic medicine Naturopathic doctors base their practice on six timeless principles founded on medical tradition and scientific evidence. Let nature heal. Our bodies have a powerful, innate instinct for self-healing. By finding and removing the barriers to this self-healing - such as poor diet or unhealthy habits - naturopathic medicine can nurture this process. Identify and treat causes. Naturopathic doctors understand that symptoms will return unless the root of illness is addressed. Rather than cover up symptoms, they seek to find and treat the cause of these symptoms. First, do no harm. Naturopathic doctors follow three precepts to ensure their patients' safety: Use low-risk procedures and healing compounds - such as dietary supplements, herbal extracts and homeopathy - with few or no side effects. When possible, do not suppress symptoms, which are the body's efforts to self-heal. Customize each diagnosis and treatment plan to fit each patient. We all heal in different ways and naturopathic doctors respect each individual patient's differences. Educate patients. Naturopathic medicine believes that doctors must also be educators. That's why naturopathic doctors teach their patients how to eat, exercise, relax and nurture themselves physically and emotionally. They also encourage self-responsibility and work closely with each patient. Treat the whole person. We each have a unique physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, sexual and spiritual makeup. Naturopathic doctors know that all these factors affect our health, and includes each in a carefully tailored treatment strategy. Prevent illness. The adage \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\" has never been truer. Proactive medicine saves money, pain, misery and lives. That's why naturopathic doctors evaluate risk factors, genetics and vulnerability to disease. A focus on wellness and addressing concerns early reduces the likelihood of future illness.
