Overall, these vaccines are safe and effective, and it is crucial for all people to get them, provided they are medically able to do so. A [2021 study](https://ard.bmj.com/content/80/Suppl_1/199) involving 1,519 people with [arthritis](/articles/7621) and other musculoskeletal conditions found that only 5 in 100 of the participants experienced flare-ups following the COVID-19 vaccine, and only 1.2% experienced severe flare-ups. A small [2022 review](https://www.cureus.com/articles/95397-covid-19-vaccine-related-arthritis-a-descriptive-study-of-case-reports-on-a-rare-complication#:~:text=Patients%20with%20COVID%2D19%20vaccination,15%2C16%2C35%5D.) reported that common flare-up symptoms included swelling, pain, and stiffness in affected joints. It is important to note that such side effects are rare, and most people receiving COVID-19 vaccines do so without adverse outcomes. This article discusses why it is important to get the COVID-19 vaccine. It also looks at how safe and effective the vaccine is for those with arthritis. It is important for a person to get the COVID-19 vaccine if they are medically able to do so. A 2021 study in [The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(21)00186-7/fulltext) This is because the vaccine [reduces](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html) Additionally, those with certain medical conditions have a [higher risk](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html) - requiring hospitalization - needing intensive care - requiring a ventilator to help them breathe - experiencing chronic symptoms, or [long COVID](/articles/long-covid) - death According to a [2021 study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/art.41800) - contracting SARS-CoV-2 - developing severe illness with COVID-19 - requiring hospitalization - death due to COVID-19-related complications The study found that people with RA were 25% more likely than those in the general population to contract the virus. They were also 35% more likely to require hospitalization or die after contracting it. The COVID-19 vaccine is [safe and effective](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html) A [2021 study](https://ard.bmj.com/content/80/Suppl_1/199) followed 1,519 people with arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions, including RA, [psoriatic arthritis](/articles/316741), and other forms of arthritis. Of the participants, 78% received the [Pfizer vaccine](/articles/pfizer-vaccine-for-coronavirus), 16% received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, 5% received the Moderna vaccine, and 1% received an uncertain vaccine type. After vaccination, 5% of the participants experienced arthritic flare-ups, and 1.2% experienced severe flare-ups. Despite this, most data show that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe for people with arthritis. The study found that most adverse effects were the same as those experienced by the general population. The side effects were short-term and nonserious. The authors of the study conclude that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe for those with RA and those taking treatments that influence the [immune system](/articles/320101). A [2022 study](https://ard.bmj.com/content/81/4/564) involving 5,493 [RA](/articles/323361) patients similarly found that there is no association between two-dose COVID-19 vaccination and arthritis flares. There is no evidence to date that the vaccine triggers flare-ups in [osteoarthritis](/articles/27871). Some researchers have expressed concerns that disease-modifying drugs might change the immune system's response to the COVID-19 vaccine, making it less effective. Authors of a [2021 study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(21)00186-7/fulltext) The lowest antibody response was among those taking Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Despite this, 67% of the 12 people who were taking JAK inhibitors in monotherapy or combination therapy developed a sufficient antibody dose to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. The study notes that 94% of people taking anticytokine biologics developed a One anticytokine biologic, rituximab, depletes [B cells](/articles/320987#types-of-lymphocytes) \u2014 which make antibodies. Due to this, people do not receive this until after vaccination is complete. The [most common](https://ard.bmj.com/content/80/Suppl_1/199) side effects in those with arthritis include: The side effects are usually short-term and will resolve without treatment. However, a person should contact a doctor if the side effects persist or steadily worsen. People who experience [difficulty breathing](/articles/324429), a severe [rash](/articles/317999), or other serious symptoms may have a vaccine [allergy](/articles/264419) and should therefore seek immediate medical care. No arthritis or public health agency currently recommends discontinuing arthritis medication, either because of the vaccine or to avoid contracting SARS-CoV-2. Stopping arthritis medication can trigger a flare, especially if a person stops taking their medication suddenly. Moreover, [research suggests](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(21)00186-7/fulltext) A person should consult a doctor about the risks and benefits of continuing medications. People with serious underlying health conditions should discuss these conditions with a doctor. They may also want to undergo testing to ensure their bodies have produced antibodies in response to the vaccine. All people living in the United States aged [6 months](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) It is important to note that COVID-19 vaccines are [free](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-care-uninsured-individuals/index.html) for everyone, including those without [health insurance](/articles/323367). Each state has its own COVID-19 vaccine policies and procedures. A person can try visiting the state department of health for help finding a vaccine locally. Additionally, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/reporting/vaccinefinder/about.html) People with [autoimmune diseases](/articles/list-of-autoimmune-diseases), including RA, [may have](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5607155/) [None](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html) Additionally, not all forms of arthritis are autoimmune conditions. Osteoarthritis [causes](https://curearthritis.org/osteoarthritis/) damage to the cartilage rather than autoimmune reactions. This means that most people with arthritis do not need to avoid any particular COVID-19 vaccine. However, if a person has a high risk of [blood clots](/articles/how-to-know-if-you-have-a-blood-clot), a doctor may have a vaccine preference for them. People with arthritis may be concerned about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. However, the vaccine is very safe and effective for those with arthritis. A person may experience some side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine, including pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, and, in rare cases, an arthritis flare. For most people, however, the side effects are temporary. Additionally, receiving the COVID-19 vaccine may be of particular benefit to people with arthritis, especially those with RA, who are at greater risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 and experiencing severe illness due to COVID-19. A doctor can help a person weigh the risks and benefits of the vaccine and may also be able to make recommendations about preventing an arthritis flare. If people are concerned about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, they should consult a healthcare professional. "}
