In week 8, influenza A positivity continues to be over 20% while influenza B positivity has steadily decreased to just under 10%. During week 8, 26% of specimens in BC tested positive for influenza virus of which 66% were influenza A and 34% were influenza B. This represents a slight change from earlier in the season when a more equal mix of influenza A and influenza B contributed. Since week 40, 47 laboratory -confirmed influenz a outbreaks have been reported from long term care facilities, higher than for the same period during the 2018- 19 season (n=38) but lower than for the same period of 2017- 18 (n=137) and 2016- 17 (n=174). The weekly number of influenza outbreaks in LTCFs has been relatively stable since early December 2019. Recent concerns related to the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS -CoV-2) may be influencing influenza and other respiratory virus surveillance owing to increased awareness and testing of patients with febrile respiratory illness. An updated situation report related to the coronavirus disease (COVID -19) epidemic, as of February 27 th, is provided on page 11 .

Nine out of 19 (47%) sentinel ILI monitoring sites have reported data for week 8. Fluctuating trends seen in recent weeks may require cautious interpretation following broad public messaging around the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID -19). Rates may also change as reporting becomes more complete.

Medical Services Plan BC Medical Services Plan (MSP) general practitioner claims for influenza illness as a proportion of all submitted MSP claims\u00a7 showed an overall decreasing trend but exceeded historical averages in BC overall (Figure 3 ). A similar pattern was observed at the regi onal level w ith the exception of Vancouver Island where slight increasing trend was observed and Northern Health A uthority , which showed a decreasing trend but MSP claims remained above the 10- year maximum . Recent trends require cautious interpretation following broad public messaging around the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID -19).

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 4 British Columbia Laboratory Reports Increased testing of patients with febrile respiratory il lness more generally following emergence of SARS- CoV-2 may be influencing recent influenza trend analysis, requiring cautious interpretation. Influenza virus test -positivity For the current reporting week 8 of 2020, 433/1698 (26%) of specimens tested for influenza at laboratories across BC1 were positive, including 284/ 1698 (17%) positive for in fluenza A and 149/1698 (9%) positive for influenza B. Accordingly, influenza A viruses comprised 66% (i.e. 284/433) and influenza B viruses comprised 34% (i.e. 149/4 33) of influenza virus detections in week 8 . There has been a decrease in influenza B positivity since week 5, and an increase in influenza A positivity since week 7 (Figure 5 ). Cumulatively since week 40 (starting September 29, 2019), of the 23 ,326 specimens tested for influenza at laboratories across BC, 2163 (9%) tested positiv e for influenza A and 1575 (7%) tested positive for influenza B. Throughout the seas on, influenza A has comprised 58 % and influenza B has comprised 42 % of total influenza virus detections. Figure 5: Influenza virus positivity among respiratory specimens tested by participating laboratories1 across BC, 2019- 2020 season *2 1 The percentage influenza positivity is presented by influenza type based on primary specimens submitted for influenza testing at the BCCDC Public Health Laboratory (PHL) and other external sites that share complete testing data with the BCCDC PHL. From week 40, reporting sites include: BC Children's and Women's Hospital, Children's and Women's Hospital Laboratory, Fraser Health Medical Microbiology Laboratory, Island Health, Providence Health Care, Powell Riv er Hospital , St. Paul's Hospital , Vancouver General Hospital, Victoria General Hospital, Victoria Coastal Health, BCCDC Public Health Laboratory, Interior Health Authority sites and Northern Health Authority sites. 2 Rates are subject to change with subsequent data reconciliation. Findings support trend analysis but note data for week 35- 39 do not include all testing sites in BC. Data from week 35- 38 were derived manually from weekly FluWatch's Respiratory Virus Detection Surveillance System (RVDSS) report data and the Flu Data Mart. Influenza positivity data for week 39 came exclusively from the FluWatch's RVDSS Week 39 Report. Source: Summary provided by the BCCDC Public Health Laboratory. BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2019 -20 5 Influenza virus type/ subtype characterization Due to the high volume of respiratory testing and workload involved around SARS- CoV-2 requests , the BCCDC PHL has temporarily halted influenza A subtyping. As a result, the influenza and other virus detection graph (Figure 6) will have an increase in the number of influenza A(subtype unknown) samples, starting week 4. In week 8, among influenza viruses subjected to further characterization*, 63% (183/292) were influenza A and 37% (109/292) were infl uenza B and of (743/2370) BCCDC PHL remain influenza A(subtype unknown). The BCCDC PHL also conducts testing for other respiratory viruses (ORV) among specimens from select sites across the province. Other external sites perform their own ORV testing and this report does not include data from all sites across the province. Among ORV testing at the BCCDC PHL during week 8 , RSV (n= 48) was the most commonly detected virus, followed by entero/rhinoviruses viruses (n=34) . Figure 6 : Influenza and other virus detections among respiratory specimens submitted to BCCD C Public Health Laboratory, 2019- 2020* Source: BCCDC Public Health Laboratory (PHDRW); Data are current to February 27, 2020. * The BCCDC P ublic Health Laboratory (P HL) conducts the majority of influenza subtype characterization for the province, including for primary specimens submitted directly to the BCCDC PHL for influenza diagnosis, as well as for specimens that have tested positive for influenza at other external sites and for which secondary subtyping was requested. Influenza A(H1N1 )pdm09 and influenza A(subtype unknown) weekly case counts as directly typed/subtyped on primary specimens by Island Health Authority are also incorporated into the influenza counts in the graph and narrative summary above. Among typed/subtyped viruses with ag e information since week 40, median age of A(H1N1)pdm09 cases was 47 years of age and of A(H3N2) detections was 65 years of age. Median age was substantial ly younger for influenza B at 18 years (Figures 7 and 8 ). Overall , 575/1060 (54%) influenza B detections have been children <20 years of age whereas that age group comprises <20 % of the population of British Columbia (source: PEOPLE 2019 Population Projections ).

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2019 -20 7 BC Children's and Women's Health Centre Laboratory In week 8, among 136 specimens tested for influenza at the BC Children's and Women's Health Centre laboratory , 21 (15%) were positive for influenza A (not subtyped), 24 (18%) were positive for influenza B, and 13 (10%) were positive for RSV (Figure 9 ). Figure 9 : Influenza and other virus detections among respiratory specimens submitted to BC Children's and Women's Health Centre Laboratory, 2019- 2020* * Positive rates were calculated using aggregate data. The denominators for each rate represent the total number of tests; multiple tests may be performed for a single specimen and/or patient. BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2019 -20 8 Influenza -like Illness (ILI) Outbreaks In week 8, 4 laboratory -confirmed influenza outbreak s (4 influenza A(subtype pending) ) were reported from long- term care facilities (LTCF) . Two school ILI outbreak s, with unknown etiology, were also reported for this period. The outbreak s occurred in IHA, currently the only health authority routinely reporting school ILI outbreaks to BCCDC. No acute care facility outbreaks were reported to the BCCDC in week 8 (Figures 10 and 11 ). Since week 40, a total of 47 laboratory -confirmed LTCF influenza outbreaks have been reported. This tally of LTCF outbreaks for the 2019- 2020 season from week 40 to date (n=47) is higher than the tally reported to the BCCDC for the same period during the 2018- 19 season (n=38) but substantially lower than across the same period during the predominant A( H3N2) epidemics in 2017- 10: Number of influenza -like illness (ILI) outbreaks reported, British Columbia 2019 -20 Figure 11: Number of influenza outbreaks by type/subtype in long -term care facilities (LTCF), Br itish Columbia 2019- 20 * School -based ILI outbreak defined as >10% absenteeism on any day, most likely due to ILI onset.

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2019 -20 9 2019/20 influenza vaccine effectiveness estimates Canadian Mid- Season 2019/20 Vaccine Effectiveness Estimates On February 20th, 2020, the Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network (SPSN) published midseason estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the 2019/20 season, showing the v accine provided substantial protection against medically -attended febrile respiratory illness due to influenza during the period spanning November 1 to February 1, 2020. The full report is available as an open- access publication in the online journal Euros urveillance: https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560- 7917.ES.2020.25.7.2000103 A total of 2,808 participants contributed, of which half were influenza test -positive, including a roughly equal mix of influenza A and B viruses. Among the subtyped influenza A specimens, about three quarters were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. The majority (about 60%) of participants contributing to VE analyses were working- age adults 20- 64 years -old. VE overall was 58% (95%confidence interval (CI): 47 to 66), reflecting the preponderance of contributing adults 20- 64years old (55%; 95%CI: 41 to 66), with higher point estimates among children 1- 19years (74%; 95%CI: 59 to 84), but lower among adults aged 65years (18%; 95%CI: 59 to 58). Overall, the 2019/20 VE reported by the Canadian SPSN indicates that among non- elderly individuals, about six of 10 cases of medically -attended febrile respiratory illness due to influenza were prevented by vaccination. United States Mid- Season 2019/20 Vaccine Effectiveness Estimates On February 20, the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) also reported interim VE estimates, including VE of 45% (95% CI: 36 to 53) overall against medically -attended acute respiratory illness, 50% (95% CI: 39 to 59) for influenza B/Victoria, and 37% (95% CI: 19 to 52) for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Influenza A(H3N2) sample size was insufficient to calculate VE.

Associated deaths globally have reached 2,811 of which all but 67 have been reported from mainland China. Since our last surveillance bulletin one week ago, confirmed case counts outside of mainland China increased more than three- fold. For the first time, o n February 26, new confirmed cases reported from outside of China exceeded those reported from within China. In particular, outside of mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR, Taiwan and 46 countries have now reported 4,079 cases . Of these countries, South Korea (n=1,766), Italy (n=528), Iran (n=245), and Singapore (n=96) have reported the most cases. In the past week, the virus has also spread further in the Middle East and Europe; and Brazil has also confirmed its first case, thereby becoming the first affected country in South America ( Figures 12 and 13). South Korea currently faces the fastest growing COVID -19 outbreak , including a 40% jump in case counts from yesterday (n=1261) to today (n=1766). Additionally, the state of California has reported the first case of COVID -19 in the US with unknown source (e.g. no travel history or contact with a probable or confirmed case), a signal of concern related to unrecognized community transmission. In Canada, 13 laboratory -confirmed COVID -19 cases have been reported to date (seven in BC and six in Ontario). In BC, three of the seven confirmed cases had travel history to Wuhan city in Hubei prov ince of China; this included a married couple. Two of the cases had other international travel history including Changzhou city, Jiangsu province, China; and Tehran, Iran. Finally, two of the cases constitute local transmissions: one household contact of the married couple with travel history to Wuhan city, and the other a close contact of the confirmed case who traveled to Iran. The most recent two cases in Ontario are also linked to Iran: a husband and wife pair for whom the wife had recently returned from a trip to I ran. In the past week, Canadian travel health notices have been updated. As of now, advisories include Level 3 (avoid non- essential travel) applied to China; Level 2 (practise special precautions) applied to South Korea, Northern Italy and Iran; and Level 1 (pr actise usual precautions) applied to Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore. However, these advisories are subject to frequent update as the global situation changes, so please regularly consult the Government of Canada travel health notices, available here: https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health- safety/travel -health- notices The Public Health Agency of Canada has updated the COVID -19 national surveillance case definitions to take into account additionally affected countries, including additional countries beyond China with travel health notices .

Influenza A and B continue to co- circulate. The percent positivity for influenza A in week 7 was 16%, similar to prior weeks and below average for this time of year. However, t he percent positivity of influenza B at 13 % was two times greater than the average ( 5.3%) for this time of year. Among subtyped influenza A detections, influenza A(H1N1) accounted for 83 % of detections, similar to previous two weeks. Since week 35, a total of 38 ,671 laboratory detections of infl uenza were reported, of which 57 % (22,035) were influenza A. Among subtyped influenza A detections (5,279), A(H1N1) remains the predominant subtype this season (64 %). Among the regions that reported influenza activity in week 7, 40% reported sporadic activity, 56% reported localized activity, and 2% reported widespread activity . FluWatch report (week at: https://www.canada.ca/en/public -health/services/diseases/flu- surveillance/weekly - influenza- reports .html National Microbiology Laboratory (NML): Strain Characterization From September 1 to February 27, 2020, the NML has characterized 1157 influenza viruses [ 159 A(H3N2), 406 A(H1N1) and 433 influenza B] that were received from Canadian laboratories. Influenza A(H3N2): Eleven influenza A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized as A/Kansas/14/2017- like, whereas 44 viruses showed reduced titer with ferret antisera raised against egg- propagated A/Kansas/14/2017. Three influenza A (H3N2) viruses characterized belonged to clade 3C.3a and 28 viruses belonged to genetic subclade 3C.2a1b. Sequencing is pending for the remaining isolates. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09: 211 A(H1N1) viruses characterized were antigenically similar to A/Brisbane/02/2018. 195 viruses showed reduced titer with ferret antisera raised against egg- propagated A/Brisbane/02/2018. Influenza B: 19 viruses characterized were antigenically similar to B/Colorado/06/2017, whereas 161 viruses showed reduced titer with ferret antisera raised against cell culture- propagated B/Colorado/06/2017. Sequence analysis showed that 150 of the reduced viruses had a three amino acid deletion (162- 164) in the HA gene. Two viruses characterized were antigenically similar to B/Phuket/3073/2013. National Microbiology Laboratory (NML): Antiviral Resistance From September 1, 2019, to February 27, 2020, the NML received influenza viruses from Canadian laboratories f or drug susceptibility testing. Amantadine: High levels of resistance to amantadine persist among influenza A(H1N1) and influenza A(H3N2) viruses . Resistance results not presented. Oseltamivir: Of the 554 influenza viruses [ 148 H3N2, 192 H1N1 and 214 B] tested against oseltamivir . All 148 H3N2 and 214 B viruses were sensitive to oseltamivir. Of the 192 H1N1 viruses tested, 191 were sensitive to oseltamivir and one virus was resistant to oseltamivir with H275Y mutation. Zanamivir: Of the 553 influenza viruses [ 147 H3N2, 192 H1N1 and 214 B] tested against zanamivir, all were sensitive. Updated Antiviral Guidelines The Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada (AMMI Canada) have released updated guidance on the use of antiviral for the 2019- 2020 influenza season. These guidelines are available at: https://www.ammi.ca/Content/AC - %20Guidance%20of%20Antiviral%20Agents%2019- 20.pdf . BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2019 -20 14 International USA ( week 7, February 9 to February 15, 2020) Key indicators that track influenza activity remain high in the US but decreased slightly in week 7. The proportion of outpatient visits for ILI remained above the national baseline (2.4%) at 6.1%. The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza during week 7 (6.8%) was below the epidemic threshold of 7.3%. Total of 105 influenza- associated pediatric deaths were reported to the US CDC in the current influenza season, 13 of which were r eported in week 7 . In week 7, a total of 49,510 specimens were tested for influenza in the US and of the 30% ( 14,657) positive specimens, 64% were influenza A and 37% were influenza B viruses . Among subtyped influenza A specimens (n=637) in week 7, 96% were A(H1N1) pdm09 and 4% were A(H3N2). Among lineage characterized influenza B specimens (n=344) , almost all were Victoria (98%) . Since week 40, 20% (174,037/888,399) of all tested specimens in the US were positive for influenza, of which 46% (79,269) were influenza A and 55% (94,768) were influenza B. Among subtyped influenza 91% were A(H1N1) pdm09 and 9% were A(H3N2). Among lineage characterized influenza B specimens (n=11, 796), almost all were Victoria (98%) . The US CDC has p osted a summary of influenza activity in the United States and elsewhere, available at: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm . WHO ( February 17, 2020, based on data up to February 2, 2020) In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity remains elevated overall. In Europe, influenza activity continued to increase across the region but appeared to have peaked in some countries of Northern Europe. Influenza A detections predominated in most reporting countries. In Central Asia, influenza activity increased with all seasonal influenza subtypes co- circulating. In Northern Africa, influenza activity continued to increase in Algeria and Tunisia with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 mos t frequently detected followed by influenza B viruses. In Western and East Asia, influenza ac tivity remained elevated overall . Influenza activity incr eased in Armenia, and remained elevated in Israel, Lebanon and Turkey, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B v iruses co -circulating. In China, ILI activity increased once again after a slight decrease reported in recent weeks and was at a greater level than the activity recorded during the same time period in the three previous seasons. Influenza activity, however , decreased , with influenza A(H3N2) and B/Victoria lineage viruses co- circulating. From January 20, 2020 to February 2, 2020, the WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 204,655 specimens. Of these, 59,702 were positive for influenza viruses including 35,359 (59%) typed as influenza A and 24, 343 (41%) as influenza B. Of subtyped influenza A viruses, 7, 321 (76%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 2 ,333 (24%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 26 (1.5%) belonged to the B( Yamagata) lineage and 1,746 (98.5%) to the B(Victoria) lineage. In countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, i nfluenza activity remains at inter- seasonal levels. In countries in the tropical zone, majority reported low influenza activity . Some exceptions include Mexico where influenza activity continued to increase with inf luenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses most frequently detected and Afghanistan, where influenza activity remained elevated over the past few weeks, with all seasonal subtypes det ected.
