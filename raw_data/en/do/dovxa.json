Candidates applying to the traditional admission pathway to NEOMED as a first-year medicine student should begin the application process through the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). As a member of the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC), NEOMED participates in a common application service and abides by AAMC deadlines and practices. Who should apply? Successful candidates for the College of Medicine at NEOMED include individuals: - Who possess the intelligence, integrity, and personal, and emotional characteristics necessary for them to become competent physicians. - Who seek careers as physicians practicing patient centered care. - Who seek to serve as leaders of transformative change in healthcare in Ohio and beyond. - Who strive to uphold the [mission, vision and values of the College](https://www.neomed.edu/medicine/about/mission/). EARLY DECISION ADMISSION All Traditional Admission applicants to the M.D. program who consider NEOMED their medical school of choice and are strongly aligned with its mission are encouraged to apply electing the Early Decision Plan. - Early Decision is binding, which means that candidates who receive offers of admission are obligated by AMCAS policy to attend NEOMED should they wish to attend any allopathic school of medicine. - All Early Decision applicants must present valid MCAT scores, apply through AMCAS by August 1, and have the secondary application (by invitation only) complete and verified to the Office of Admissions by Sept. 1 of the year before anticipated enrollment. - Notification to the applicant regarding admission is given by Oct. 1. If selected, an EDP admit receives the benefit of early notification of acceptance and is, therefore, obligated to attend the NEOMED College of Medicine under American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) admission policy. If not selected for admission through the early decision plan, applicants may then apply to other medical schools. For more about consideration of whether the early decision program is right for you, visit [students-residents.aamc.org](https://students-residents.aamc.org/). EARLY DECISION PLAN: OHIO ADMISSION ADVANTAGE While all traditional admission candidates are encouraged to consider the early decision plan, NEOMED uses the early decision plan to extend highly favorable consideration toward a number of Ohio candidates with above-average academic credentials. - For these purposes, an Ohio candidate is any early decision plan applicant who either maintains permanent residence in Ohio and indicates as much on his or her AMCAS application or who attends/attended an Ohio institution of post-secondary education (university, college, community college), whether state or private - Ohio candidates with above-average academic profiles selecting the early decision plan receive a significant advantage over candidates that elect the regular decision plan. Ohio candidates pursuing admission to NEOMED outside of early assurance are strongly encouraged to apply using the early decision plan to maximize their chances for admission to medical school in the event that NEOMED is their first choice. - All early decision policies, procedures, and deadlines apply to the Ohio Admission Advantage. For full details and policies, please refer to the [NEOMED Compass](/registrar/catalog/), which is our catalog and handbook.
