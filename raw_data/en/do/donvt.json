It incorporates the principles of Spinal alignment, Deep Tissue Massage, Acupressure, and Radiant Far-Infrared Heat to alleviate stress and pain accumulated within your body from everyday living. This combination of Eastern Alternative Healing practices and Western Therapeutical technology works simultaneously to: - Improve your blood circulation - Loosen stiff muscles - Reduce Joint pain - Reduce pain due to inflammation Based on the belief that our body is best treated as a whole and with balance, the Ceragem uses acupuncture, chiropractic stretching, massage methods and employs far infrared heat (FIR) to assist the body's inherent healing ability. CERAGEM brings you the benefits of: Gentle Spinal decompression and mobility Working to relieve compressed nerves by encouraging spinal alignment and mobility.A correctly aligned spine stimulates the system and helps your body to return to its natural rhythms. Massage Massage relaxes muscles and tendons around the spine, relieving pressure on the spinal cord, and allowing movement of the vertebrae. Massaging also stretches the spine to release pressure from the gel-like discs that act as cushions between each vertebra, which are the bones that comprise the spinal column. As we age, our backs stiffen, and for some of us, our backs will become weak which may cause misalignment. Massage of the spinal area, experienced in the first part of a CERAGEM session, can prevent stiffening and weakening of your back. Massage aids pain relief, relaxation of the body and mind, and stimulates circulation. Moxibustion Moxibustion, an effect widely used in Eastern medicine, uses heat derived from a specific material to aid in healing and relaxation. CERAGEM products use the application of heat to stimulate meridian (pressure) points and increase blood flow to support your body's natural ability to repair. Jade Stone Jade is a semiprecious stone that has been used in Eastern medicine for thousands of years to stimulate Chi (Qi), the life force in our bodies. A block in the flow of Chi results in discomfort or even disease. The jade stones also apply acupressure (like acupuncture without needles) to special points along the meridians of your body. This can release blocked energy and promote energy flow to certain areas helping to restore your inner balance. How Often Should I Use Ceragem? The more you use CERAGEM, the faster you will feel better. In our center you have the opportunity to experience the effects of CERAGEM during business hours by appointment. How Many Visits Until I Start To See Results? Results are cumulative and depending on your health condition, how long you have had the condition or injury, your age, the kind of work or sports you are involved in, and lifestyle choices you make. We advise you to use CERAGEM as much as you can and not to miss this golden opportunity. Is There Any Age Limit On Who Can Use The Bed? No age limit; in fact, taking care of your health should start as young as possible. Everyone is welcome - if you are under 18 please have a parent or guardian with you when you come. Are There Any Risks With Using Ceragem? Ceragem beds are a class II 510K medical device approved by FDA for stress relief and blood circulation. We are not aware of any side effects. If you still have concerns, you may want to talk to your doctor about using CERAGEM products. What Is Far Infrared? Is It Safe? Far infra-red is a specific type of light that is not visible to the naked eye but can be felt as warmth. It is the type of heat that we receive from the sun and that our bodies generate all the time - that's why our bodies love it. Far infra-red is used in incubators to nurture newborn babies. Far infra-red is not only safe, but it is also essential to life. We depend on far infra-red to stay alive. All of our essential bodily functions depend on far infrared heat like keeping our blood warm and circulating, maintaining a strong immune system. When we absorb far infra-red, our blood cells move faster. Active, moving blood means better circulation, better healing, better detox, and better cell regeneration. Better circulation means more oxygen in your blood. Oxygen-rich blood is the best way your body will reduce swelling and inflammation, heal tissue and relieve pain. Our bodies will absorb all the far-infrared it can to boost its ability to perform all these functions. Far infra-red IS NOT ultraviolet (UV). Remember, all premature babies are put into incubators that use far infra-red to save and support their lives. How Does Ceragem Use Far Infrared? The CERAGEM Therapeutic Massage beds use far infra-red from solid jade and epoxy carbon panels as it closely resembles that generated by the body. I Am Healthy And Exercise Already.
