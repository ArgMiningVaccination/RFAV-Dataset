Nature Energy's biogas plants treated more than 4.7 million tonnes of biomass - waste from agriculture, industry and households - in 2022, converting it into more than 185 million m3 of green gas. That much biogas could be used to fuel almost 8,200 busses driving 30,000 miles per year, or to heat 160,000 homes. All of this is CO2 neutral as well as replacing fossil fuels. Biogas is circular economy at its best Nature Energy is market leader in turning these many millon tonnes of biomass into green, CO2 neutral gas as effectively as possible. We collect and deliver biomass from businesses, agriculture and households and return the degassed biomass to the agriculture that recycles nutrients. This is circular economy at its best. At the same time, we always make sure that the surrounding community around our biogas plants remains as undisturbed as possible by transport and odours. Nature Energy is already making a big difference in the green transition, but our ambitions are even bigger. That is why Nature Energy is investing intensively in research, including our own laboratory at our head office in Odense. The laboratory is a site for research into refining the technology so that we can extract even more energy from biomass and produce even better fertiliser for agriculture. The laboratory is also doing research in new biomasses for production of green, CO2 neutral energy in the future. Nature Energy's ambitions to contribute to the green transition together with farmers, businesses and people reaches beyond Denmark's borders. Over the next few years, Nature Energy will be investing in new large biogas plants in other countries in Europe and North America. "}
