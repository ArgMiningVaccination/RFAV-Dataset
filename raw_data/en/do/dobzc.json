Severe OA is one of the mai n reasons for hip and knee replacement surgery. Despite the impact of the disease, there h as been little information about the use of health services by people with OA, making it diffic ult for policy makers and health care administrators to allocate resources. The BC OA survey aimed to address this information gap. This project was conducted through the collaboration of the Arthritis Research Centre of Canada, the Primary Health Care Branch of BC Ministry of Health (MoH), and The Arthritis Soci ety (TAS). The objectives were to: (1.) assess the health status and functional disability of people living with OA; (2.) describe the use of services and treatments; and (3.) describe the a ccess barriers to services and treatments. Six thousand BC residents with OA were randomly sel ected to receive a mailed questionnaire in June 2007. The main eligibility criteria include: ( 1) meeting the case definitions for OA or hip/knee replacement surgeries between 1992 and 200 6; (2) having at least two medical visits for OA or one hospitalization within a 365-day period; and (3) age 19 or older. Of the 6000 questionnaires, 2134 (response rate=36% ) were returned with usable data, and 1713 reported that they had been told by a health profes sional that they had arthritis. The average age of participants was 67.3 years. Almost 70% rated t heir general health as good, very good or excellent. More than 30% continued to work and most of them had not changed their workload. Among those who stopped working, arthritis was not the most common reason for retirement. The participants used a variety of health services and treatments. The most frequently reported barrier to access a health professional was the lon g waiting time. Almost 48% of those seeing an orthopaedic surgeon waited longer than three months . Cost was another frequently reported access barrier to health professionals. Exercise, weight management, and medications are th e first-line treatment for OA. This survey found 57% of participants used acetaminophen, 36% u sed ibuprofen, 17% used aspirin, and 25% used other NSAIDs. However, the use of non-pharmaco logical treatment was very low, with only 26% of people reported that they exercised in the past year, and only 24% of those who were overweight or obese received weight-loss couns elling. The use of community services was also low, with only 24% of the participants using o ne or more programs offered by TAS. Results of this survey present a positive picture o f the general health of this population. On the other hand, gaps are found in the management of OA, especially the low use of inexpensive interventions that can effectively reduce long term disability and the need for joint replacement surgery. Since interventions that address physical inactivity and obesity often require people to make major life-style changes, consultations for ex ercise and healthy eating, and information about community resources are essential components of OA care. BC Osteoarthritis Survey; January 2008 1Chapter 1: IIIIntroduction Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of join t disease, affecting about 433,000 British Columbians (1 in 10 people). 1 The prevalence is higher for women of all age gro ups. About one- third of men and 40% of women had OA in the age 70 to 74 category.1 People with severe OA may require joint replacement surgeries. In 2004-05 , there were 8,734 joint replacement surgeries and the number increased to more than 10, 000 in 2006-07. By 2020, this figure is estimated to rise to 20,000 with an annual cost of $230 million. 2 As the population ages, the economic impact of OA is expected to increase propo rtionately. In most cases, the onset of OA is insidious and the damage progresses slowly over years. Cartilage acts to cushion the joints and in OA the cartilage is lost prematurely. This causes the bones rub together, resulting in damage and pain. L ow grade inflammation of the synovial membrane can also occur.3 The knees, hips, hands and spine are the most comm only affected joints. People with OA often experience pain, joint stiffness, swelling, and muscle weakness. Arthritis of the knee and hip in particular can com promise activities such as walking, climbing stairs, and self-care. 4 Treatments for OA consist of education, exercise, w eight management, medication, and surgery.5-7 While most OA cases are treated by primary care ph ysicians, individuals may also seek help from specialists, allied health professio nals, and complementary and alternative therapy practitioners. They may also access communi ty resources such as education and exercise programs, and fitness facilities. However, there ha s been little information about the use of health services by people with OA, making it challe nging for policy makers and health care administrators to make decisions about resources al location. In May 2007, a research team, led by Drs. Linda Li and Jacek Kopec, received funding from the Healthy Heart Society - IMPACT BC and The Arthritis Society BC & Yukon Division (TAS) to conduct a survey of British Columbians with OA to a ssess their health status, quality of life, and their use of health services. Adults with OA were i dentified using the BC medical services plan claims data and were asked to complete a questionna ire. This project was conducted in partnership with the Primary Health Care Branch of BC Ministry of Health (MoH) and TAS. Prior to this survey, the MoH and TAS provided funding for a pilot study to test the survey methodology and to estimat e a response rate for the current survey. Objectives This report presents the results of the BC OA surve y. Specific objectives of this project were to: 1. Assess the health status and functional disability of people with OA. 2. Describe the use of services and treatments (pharma cological / non-pharmacological treatments, surgical interventions, complementary a nd alternative therapies, and community services) by people with OA. 3. Describe the access barriers to services and treatm ents. BC Osteoarthritis Survey; January 2008 2Chapter 2: PP PPilot Study In 2004, a pilot study was conducted to test the fe asibility of a full scale province-wide survey. The questionnaire was sent to 200 people identified as having OA using physician billing data (100 each from the Richmond Health Service Delivery Area (HSDA) and the Northern Health Authority). In addition, 50 people identified as ha ving a hip or knee replacement surgery due to OA were randomly selected. The study protocol was approved by the University o f British Columbia (UBC) Behavioural Research Ethics Board (Application number: B04-0289 ). Survey Administration and Process Evaluation An invitation letter, a questionnaire booklet and a pre-paid addressed envelope were mailed to the 250 potential participants on July 21, 2004. Tw o and six weeks after the first mailing (August 4 and September 10), reminder postcards were sent t o non-responders. A reminder letter along with another copy of the survey was also sent to th e non-responders at four weeks (August 18). The cut-off date for data entry was September 10, 2 004. If participants had any questions or concerns regarding the study, they could contact st aff at ARC, TAS or MoH. To evaluate the feasibility of a full scale survey, we tracked the return rate of the questionnaires and the completion rate for each question. Summary of Results Of the 250 questionnaires, we received 123 (49.2%) with usable data by the cut-off date. Eighteen surveys were returned incomplete. Reasons for non-participation included invalid addresses, refusal to participate, or deceased. Of the 123 questionnaires, 46 (37.4%) were from the Richmond HSDA, 46 (37.4%) from the Northern Health Authority, and 31 (25.2%) from the hip or knee replacement data. The average age of the respondents was 69 + 12.7 years (range= 31 to 93 years); the majority were females (n=75; 61%), had OA of the knee (n=80; 65%), and ha d completed high school or lower (n=69; 56.1%). Of the 62 questions in the survey booklet, 15 had m ore than 10% missing data. These questions were reviewed by the research team and the wording was modified when necessary. Results of the pilot study suggested that a full pr ovince-wide survey was feasible and that a reasonable response rate could be achieved. BC Osteoarthritis Survey; January 2008 3Chapter 3: BB BBritish Columbia Osteoarthritis Survey - Methods The BC OA Survey protocol was approved by the UBC B ehavioural Research Ethics Board on April 27, 2007 (application number: H04-80289). Sample Selection A random sample of 6,000 people with OA, or hip/kne e replacement surgeries due to OA, was selected after stratifying by health authorities (V ancouver Coastal, Vancouver Island, Fraser, Interior, and Northern). This ensured equal numbers of people were included from each region. Random selection was conducted by the MoH using adm inistrative billing data for outpatient physician visits (Medical Services Plan Fee-For-Ser vice Database) and hospitalization (Discharge Abstract Database). Individuals were included if they: (1) met the case definitions for OA or hip/knee replacement surgeries between April 1, 1992 and March 31, 2006 ( Table 1 ); (2) had at least two medical visits for OA or one hospitalization within a 365-d ay period; (3) were age 19 or older on March 31, 2006; (4) were living in BC, and (5) were alive (i.e., no date of death recorded on the MoH OA administrative database at the time of sampling) . The 365-day period was a moving window. The case date was defined as the first date by whic h the case definition was met. Questionnaire The questionnaire covered five areas related to the use of health services and the health of people with OA, including: (1) the general health and como rbid conditions; (2) visits to health professionals and complementary therapy practitione rs; (3) use of medications, traditional non- pharmacological treatments, surgical interventions, complementary and alternative therapies, and community services; (4) physical function; and (5) participation in the work force ( Appendix A ). We used existing validated outcome measures where p ossible. These include: The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA In dex (WOMAC) 8 to measure pain, stiffness and physical function in people wit h hip and/or knee OA. The aggregate score ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score mea ning better outcome. SF-8 Health Survey to measure the general health status. Developed fr om the SF-36 Health Survey, 9 SF-8 uses a single item to measure each of the eig ht health domains in the original SF-36 instrument (limitations in physi cal activities, limitations in social functioning as a result of physical and/or emotiona l problems, limitations in the usual role functioning, bodily pain, general mental health, vi tality, and general health perception). The SF-8 was scored using norm-based scoring method s. The mean scores, variances and regression weights used to score the SF-8 and the s ummary measures were derived from studies in the general U.S. population in 2000. 10 Information on health resource use was collected us ing a series of questions that were pilot tested in 2004. We also included open-ended questions to e xamine the services that people found the most helpful in managing OA, problems experienced w hen accessing services, and reasons for not getting the required care.

A ll participants received a survey package, including an information letter, a questionnaire bo oklet, and a stamped return envelope during the first mailing (June 20). Reminder cards were se nt to everyone at two weeks (July 5) and four weeks (July 19). To protect confidentiality, the Mo H assigned an identification number to all participants. The researchers did not have access t o the personal contact information. Analysis Descriptive analyses, based on frequency distributi ons and percentages, were calculated to describe the health status and the use of health se rvices by people with OA. Results are presented in aggregate and in gender categories. All standardized measures were scored according to the instruction of the standardized scoring manuals.10;11 The WOMAC subscale scores were transformed to a 0 -100 scale (100 = no OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) RULE : One hospitalization or two medical visits in 365 days with an OA diagnostic code DIAGNOSTIC CODES : ICD-9 Other arthrosis EXCLUSIONS : None BC Osteoarthritis Survey; January 2008 5difficulty, 75 = mild difficulty, 50 = moderate dif ficulty, 25 = severe difficulty, 0 = extreme difficulty). Differences in WOMAC functional scores of more than 10 points on the transformed scale are generally noticeable by patients. 12 For the SF-8 measure, the raw scores were transformed into a '50/10' scoring, because the mea ns for the U.S. population is 50 with standard deviations of 10. Hence, all scores above and below 50 are above and below the average, respectively, compared to the general US population . 10 The SF-8 physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores wer e calculated using the algorithm in the SF-8 user manual. 10 To assess the treatment gaps, we applied six of the Arthritis Foundation Quality Indicators for OA, two on assessment (pain and function) and four on non-pharmacological interventions (exercise, weight management, mobility aids, and ot her assistive devices) ( Table 2 ). Developed by the RAND group, these indicators were based on a comprehensive review of literature and existing quality measures for OA, and were reviewed by a multidisciplinary expert panel.13 These indicators cover a broad spectrum of care, in cluding assessment, treatment and follow-up. A typical quality indicator includes two components : The 'IF' statement determines the eligibility for t he care process in question The 'THEN' statement specifies what care process sh ould be performed The passing rate was calculated by dividing the num ber of people received the care (i.e., those who passed the 'THEN' statement) with the number of those eligible for the care (i.e., those who passed the 'IF' statement).

IF a patient is diagnosed with symptomatic OA of the knee or hip THEN his or her pain should be assessed annually and when new to a practice Participants were told by a HP that they had arthritis (Q. 8) and were experiencing pain in hip / groin / thigh / knee (Q. 11) 1 or more visits to a family physician, rheumatologist or orthopaedic surgeon in the past year (Q. 19 a, b, c) Rationale: To be assessed annually for pain, the pe rson must have at least one visit with one physician in the past year. Limitation: It is possible that the patient saw the physician for other health problems and pain was no t assessed during the visit. 2. IF a patient is diagnosed with symptomatic OA of the knee or hip THEN his or her functional status should be assessed annually and when new to a practice. Participants were told by a HP that they had arthritis (Q. 8) and were experiencing pain in hip / groin / thigh / knee (Q. 11) 1 or more visits to a family physician, rheumatologist or orthopaedic surgeon in the past year (Q. 19 a, b, c) Rationale: To be assessed annually for functional status, the person must have at least one visit wit h one physician in the past year. Limitation: It is possible that the patient saw the physician for other health problems and function wa s not assessed during the visit. 3. IF an ambulatory patient has had a diagnosis of symptomatic OA of the knee or hip for > 3 months AND has no contraindication to exercise and is physically and mentally able to exercise THEN a directed or supervised muscle strengthening or aerobic exercise program should have been prescribed at least once and reviewed at least once per year. Participants were told by a HP that they had arthritis (Q. 8) and were experiencing pain in hip / groin / thigh / knee (Q. 11) Health did not limit the person's ability for personal care (Q. 49e) Individual had seen a PT (Q. 19d) OR Had attended Water and/or Joint Works exercise program (Q. 22) OR Had used fitness facilities (Q. 23) Rationale: Patients would have participated in a directed or supervised exercise program at least on ce if they had seen a PT and/or attended a fitness progra m. Limitations: The criteria would not capture individ uals with severe dementia or other conditions that would preclude them from participating in programs. Those included in the analysis might or might not have th eir exercise reviewed in the past year. Also, not all f itness facilities provide supervised programs. 4. IF a patient has symptomatic OA of the knee or hip and is overweight (as defined by BMI >27 kg/m 2)** THEN the patient should be advised to lose weight at least annually AND the benefit of weight loss on the symptoms Participants were told by a HP that they had arthritis (Q. 8) and were experiencing hip or knee pain (Q. 11), with a BMI >27kg/m 2 (Q. 5) Individual had used a weight-loss program or visited a dietitian' (Q. 23) Rationale: Those who used weight-loss program or saw a dietitian would have received weight loss counseling Limitation: The criteria would not capture those wh o had been advised to lose weight by other health professionals; hence the passing rate may be under- * Refer to Appendix A for the specific questions u sed for the \"IF\" and \"THEN\" statements. ** In the US, a BMI score >27 kg/m 2 is defined as overweight.

Conversely, among those who received counseling, the visit may be more than a year ago. In this case, the passing rate may be overestimated. 5. IF a patient has had symptomatic OA of the knee or hip and reports difficulty walking to accomplish activities of daily living for more than three months THEN the patient's walking ability should be assessed for need for ambulatory assistive devices. Participants were told by a HP that they had arthritis (Q. 8) and were experiencing pain in hip / groin / thigh / knee (Q. 11) The person has severe or extreme difficulties walking on flat surface (Q. 60a) 1 or more visits to a PT or OT in the past year (Q. 19 d, e) Rationale: The criteria were modified to include people with severe or extreme pain within the first month. There is evidence supporting the use of ambulatory assistive devices as early as possible t o improve mobility. Those who used saw a PT or OT would have been assessed for walking ability. Limitation: The criteria would not capture people w ho had been assessed for ambulatory assistive devices by other health professionals. 6. IF a patient has a diagnosis of OA and reports difficulties with non-ambulatory activities of daily living THEN the patient's functional ability with problem tasks should be assessed for need of non-ambulatory assistive devices to aid with problem tasks. Participants were told by a HP that they had arthritis (Q. 8) and were experiencing pain in hip / groin / thigh / knee (Q. 11) The person has severe or extreme difficulties rising from sitting (Q. 62c), putting on socks/stockings (Q. 62i), taking off socks/stockings (Q. 62k), getting in/out of bath (Q. 62m), getting on/off toilet (Q. 62o) 1 or more visits to an OT in the past year (q19e) Rationale: OTs perform assessments on activities of daily living and prescribes assistive devices for p eople with OA Limitation: The criteria would not capture people w ho had been assessed for assistive devices by other he alth professionals.

The average age of participants was 67.3 (SD a=11.1), the majority were females (n=1058; 61.8%; Table 4 ). About half of them had completed high school or lower (n= 862; 50.3%). Other than OA, the most common medical problems included high blood pressur e (43.8%), osteoporosis (19.0%), and heart problems (17.3%). Most people were diagnosed six years ago or more (n =1131; 66%; Table 5 ). The most common joints affected were: knee (n=1088; 63.5%), hand (n ts were overweight or obese. Almost 70% rated their general health as good, very good or ex cellent, however 27% said that their health was worse than a year ago. The mean SF-8 MCS was simila r to that of the general population (49.34, SD=9.92), but the PCS was below the average of the general population (40.67, SD=9.83). Among those with hip and/or knee OA (n=1349), the m ajority had mild to moderate pain, stiffness and functional limitation ( Tables 6 - 8 ), with an average aggregate WOMAC score of 66.9 (SD=20.2) ( Table 9 ).

BC Osteoarthritis Survey; January 2008 17 Use of Health Services and Treatments Health professional visits People with OA had used a variety of health service s (Table 11 ). About 90% of the participants saw a family physician (average visits last year = 5), 48.2% visited an orthopaedic surgeon (average visits last year = 1.8), 48.6% visited a p hysical therapist (average visits last year = 5.5), and 33% visited a pharmacist (average visits last y ear = 6.7). Among those who saw health professionals, about half found them to be helpful ( Table 12 ). Satisfaction was particularly high for family physician and pharmacist visits, with 66 .3% and 66.7%, respectively, rated as helpful. The majority of participants reported no problems w ith their visits to health professionals, however 47.6% of those who consulted an orthopaedic surgeon reported a waiting time longer than three months ( Table 13 ). Long waiting time was also reported by participa nts who saw a rheumatologist (24.6%) or a social worker (13.1%). Cost was another frequently reported barrier, especially among those who saw a chiropractor (16.2 %) or a physical therapist (15.9%) Table 11: Health professional visits All N=1713 Female n=1058 Male N=628 # visited the health professional (%) Avg. visit last year (SD *) # visited the health professional (%) Avg. visit last year (SD *) # visited the health professional (%) Avg. visit last year (SD *) Family doctor 1538 (89.8) 5.0 (6.7) 959 (90.6) 5.1 (7.2) 553 (88.1) 4.8 (5.8) Orthopaedic surgeon 842 (49.2) 1.8 (2.1) 487 (46.0) 1.8 (1.9) 344 (54.8) 1.8 (2.3) Physical therapist 833 (48.6) 5.5 (10.3) 534 5.6 (9.3) 289 (46.0) 5.3 (12.0) Pharmacist 564 (33.0) 6.7 (11.2) (10.6) 181 (28.8) 7.6 (12.0) Chiropractor 468 (27.3) 6.4 (10.3) 308 (29.1) 6.7 (9.5) 150 (23.9) 4.9 (6.9) Rheumatologist 394 (23.0) 1.8 (2.3) 277 (26.2) 1.7 (2.1) 112 (17.8) 2.1 (2.7) Occupational therapist 176(10.3) 3.9 (11.6) 120 (11.3) 3.8 (11.9) 55 (8.8) 4.2 (11.2) Nurse 91 (5.3) 5.7 (11.4) 56 (5.3) 5.7 (11.8) 35 (5.6) 5.7 (11.1) Social worker 61 (3.6) 3.4 (6.2) 41 (3.9) 2.0 (2.1) 19 (3.0) 6.7 (10.2) Vocational or Career Counselor 35 (2.0) 4.1 (5.8) 19 (1.8) 3.7 (6.1) 16 (2.6) 4.6 (5.8) Other service(s) 248 (14.5) 11.7 (24.7) 176 (16.6) 12.4 (27.3) 70 (11.2) 10.2 (17.3) * SD = Standard deviation BC Osteoarthritis Survey; January 2008 18 Table 12: Satisfaction with health professionals in managing osteoarthritis All Female Male # of people visited the HP* # of people rated the visit helpful (%) # of people visited the HP* # of people rated the visit helpful (%) # of people visited the HP* # of people rated the visit helpful (%) Family doctor 1538 976 (63.5) 959 615 (64.1) 553 345 (62.4) Orthopaedic surgeon 842 456 (54.2) 487 263 (54.0) 344 187 (54.4) Physical therapist 833 429 (51.5) 534 287 (53.8) 289 136 (47.1) Pharmacist 564 376 (66.7) 380 248 (65.3) 181 125 (69.1) Chiropractor 468 256 (54.7) 308 183 (59.4) 150 69 (46.0) Rheumatologist 394 193 (49.0) 277 133 (48.0) 112 56 (50.0) Occupational therapist 176 88 (50.0) 120 65 (54.2) 55 23 (41.8) Nurse 91 48 (52.8) 56 28 (50.0) 35 20 (57.1) Social worker 61 31 (50.8) 41 19 (46.3) 19 12 (63.2) Vocational or Career Counselor 35 16 (45.7) 19 9 (47.4) 16 7 (43.8) Other service(s) 248 153 (61.7) 176 112 (63.6) 70 40 (57.1) *HP = Health Professional Problems experienced with health services No problem (%) >3 month wait (%) Too expensive (%) Not available (%) Did not know about the service (%) Not applicable (%) Missing (%) 975 (63.4) 29 (1.9) 10 (0.7) 8 (0.5) 16 (1.0) 225 (14.6) 275 (17.9) 619 (64.6) 15 (1.6) 4 (0.4) 6 (0.6) 9 (0.9) 138 (14.4) 168 (17.5) 343 (62.0) 13 (2.4) 6 (1.1) 2 (0.4) 6 (1.1) 83 (15.0) 100 (18.1) 268 (31.8) 401 (47.6) 17 (2.0) 27 (3.2) 3 (0.4) 77 (9.1) 49 (5.8) 147 (30.2) 245 (50.3) 7 (1.4) 16 (3.3) 2 (0.4) 34 (7.0) 36 (7.4) 118 (34.3) 150 (43.6) 10 (2.9) 11 (3.2) 1 (0.3) 43 (12.5) 11 (3.2) 421 (50.5) 23 (2.8) 132 (15.9) 4 (0.5) 4 (0.5) 93 (11.2) 156 (18.7) 275 (51.5) 17 (3.2) 93 (17.4) 3 (0.6) 3 (0.6) 48 (9.0) 95 (17.8) 142 (49.1) 5 (1.7) 37 (12.8) 1 (0.4) 1 (0.4) 44 (15.2) 59 (20.4) 222 (47.4) 7 (1.5) 76 (16.2) 1 (0.2) 1 (0.2) 62 (13.3) 99 (21.2) 154 (50.0) 5 (1.6) 56 (18.2) 1 (0.3) 0 (0) 40 (13.0) 52 (16.9) 66 (44.0) 1 (0.7) 20 (13.3) 0 (0) 1 (0.7) 21 (14.0) 41 (27.3) 165 (41.9) 97 (24.6) 8 (2.0) 20 (5.1) 1 (0.3) 54 (13.7) 49 (12.4) 122 (44.0) 68 (24.6) 3 (1.1) 13 (4.7) 1 (0.4) 25 (9.0) 45 (16.2) 41 (36.6) 27 (24.1) 5 (4.5) 7 (6.3) 0 (0) 27 (24.1) 5 (4.5) 82 (46.6) 12 (6.8) 11 (6.3) 2 (1.1) 2 (1.1) 25 (14.2) 42 (23.9) 60 (50.0) 10 (8.3) 7 (5.8) 2 (1.7) 1 (0.8) 13 (10.8) 27 (22.5) 21 (38.2) 2 (3.6) 4 (7.3) 0 (0) 1 (1.8) 12 (21.8) 15 (27.3) BC Osteoarthritis Survey; January 2008 20 No problem (%) >3 month wait (%) Too expensive (%) Not available (%) Did not know about the service (%) Not applicable (%) Missing (%) Nurse All (n=91) 50 (55.0) 4 (4.4) 1 (1.1) 2 (2.2) 0 (0) 16 (17.6) 18 (19.8) Female (n=56) 33 (58.9) 2 (3.6) 1 (1.8) 2 (3.6) 0 (0) 8 (14.3) 10 (17.9) Male (n=35) 17 (48.6) 2 (5.7) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 8 (22.9) 8 (22.9) Social worker All (n=61) 20 (32.8) 8 (13.1) 3 (4.9) 1 (1.6) 2 (3.3) 11 (18.0) 16 (26.2) Female (n=41) 14 (34.2) 3 (7.3) 2 (4.9) 1 (2.4) 0 (0) 8 (19.5) 13 (31.7) Male (n=19) 5 (26.3) 5 (26.3) 1 (5.3) 0 (0) 2 (10.5) 3 (15.8) 3 (15.8) Other services All (n=248) 66 (26.6) 8 (3.2) 33 (13.3) 4 (1.6) 0 (0) 34 (13.7) 103 (41.5) Female (n=176) 50 (28.4) 6 (3.4) 28 (15.9) 3 (1.7) 0 (0) 23 (13.1) 66 (37.5) Male (n=70) 15 (21.4) 2 (2.9) 5 (7.1) 1 (1.4) 0 (0) 10 (14.3) 37 (52.9) BC Osteoarthritis Survey; January 2008 21 Medications, supplements, and non-pharmacological t reatments Among those who used prescription and non-prescript ion medications in the past year, 57.4% used acetaminophen ( Table 14 ). The use (NSAIDs) was also (35.7% ibuprofen, 17.3% aspirin, and 24 .5% other NSAIDs), with a small percentage of people using Cox-2 selective inhibito rs (5.9%). Many people also tried dietary supplements, with 42 .3% using glucosamine, 24.7% chondroitin, 12.6% methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), and 24% using vi tamin/mineral supplements. About 14% of respondents did not use any prescription and non -prescription medication or supplement in the past year ( Table 14 ). The majority of people reported no access problem t o medications for OA (80.4%). About 25% used a diary to record their medications and medica l appointments at least some of the times. Among those who did not use diaries, most said that their doctors had not suggested using them (Table 14 ). Almost 53% of the participants used some form of no n-pharmacological treatments in the past year, with 29% using thermotherapy (heat or ice) an d 26% using exercise in the past year ( Table 14).

BC Osteoarthritis Survey; January 2008 24 Participation in exercises and physical activities Regular exercise is beneficial for people with OA. 14;15 In this survey, we asked participants about the amount of time they spent in exercise and physical activities in the past week ( Table 16). The majority of the participants reported spendi ng time 'walking for exercise'. However, less than half spent '1 - 3 hours/week', or more, w alking. Almost 14% participated in pool exercise (e.g., swimming, aquatic exercise). Also, participation in aerobic exercises was low (17.6% bicycling; 8.1% used other aerobic exercise equipment; 9.7% participated in other aerobic exercise). Major types of exercise 16 Range of motion exercise involves taking the joint through its full availab le range once or several times without holding the end posit ion. Stretching exercise involves taking the joint through its full availab le range and applying a sustained gentle tension on targeted sof t tissue at the end position. Strengthening exercise involves the types exercise for increasing muscle strength and size. Aerobic exercise refers to exercise which is of relatively low inte nsity, uses large muscle groups, and places demands on the cardiovasc ular system. Example includes: brisk walking, swimming, and cycling.

Only 23.5% of the respondents had used one or more of the programs of fered by TAS. About 10% had participated in the TAS-affiliated Water Works (pool exercise) or Joint Works (land-based exercise) programs. The Arthritis Society website and the Art hritis Self Management Program (ASMP) offer resources and up-to-date information for peop le with arthritis, but only about 7% of participants had used these services. One in four p eople had used other community-based exercise facilities and only 14.4% had joined a wei ght loss program or consulted a dietitian. Participants were asked to rate on a 10-point scale how confident they felt in performing self- management activities (1=not at all confident, 10=c ompletely confident). The average score for performing gentle strengthening and stretching exer cises was 6.9 (SD=2.9), and performing aerobic exercises was 6.3 (SD=3.2) ( Table 18 ). Participants appeared less confident about being able to exercise without aggravating the joint symp toms, with an average confidence score of 5.7. Also, they were only moderately confident abou t using the internet or other community resources to get information about arthritis and wa ys to manage symptoms.

The average wait time for orthopaedic consult was 6 .6 (SD=7.5) months if the person was referred by a family physician, and 7.1 (SD=6.4) mo nths if referred by a rheumatologist. Only 13% of those waiting had been given a date for the surgery. When asked how long they expected to wait from the date of the orthopaedic consult to the date of surgery, participants estimated an average of 17.6 (SD=21.6) months. Close to 48% had experienced complications related to arthritis while waiting for the surgery. A total of 488 participants (28.5%) had received at least one joint replacement surgery ( Table 19 ). The average waiting times between family physici an referral and orthopaedic consult, between rheumatologist referral and orthopaedic con sult, and between orthopaedic consult to surgery date were 8.0 (SD=13.4) months, 8.2 (SD=12. 5) months, and 10.8 (SD=14.3) months, respectively. About 4% of the participants received their surgery outside of BC. The majority of these participants felt that they r eceived sufficient information to prepare for the surgery (91.4%) and after the surgery (89.3%) ( Table 19 ). About 22% incurred considerable expenses that were related to the surgery. More tha n one-third of them experienced complications related to arthritis while waiting fo r it.

Data from this survey have allowed us to assess six of the OA quality of care indicators ( Table 20). The passing rate varied substantially among indi cators, ranging from 70.4% for the assessment of pain and functional status to 7% for addressing difficulties in non-ambulatory activities. There was a trend to lower passing rate among male participants who received the required care compared to female participants.

Our findings pr esent a positive picture of the general health of this population. Despite having OA, most of the participants viewed themselves as having good health and that their health status was relati vely stable compared to a year ago. On the other hand, the results confirm the gaps in the managemen t of OA that have been reported in the literature, especially the poor uptake of inexpensi ve interventions that can effectively reduce long term disability and the need for joint replace ment surgery.17-19 This survey also documented the challenges experienced by people when seeking a ccess to health professionals and treatments, such as the waiting time for orthopaedi c consults and surgeries, and the cost of using rehabilitation treatments. The following major gaps in OA care are identified in this survey: Use of exercise and physical activity was below int ernational recommendations for the management of OA The American College of Rheumatology's (ACR) recomm ends that, at minimum, people with arthritis should accumulate 30 minutes of mode rate-intensity physical activity (e.g., brisk walking) 3 days a week or the equivalent 90 m inutes per week.20 In this survey, although the majority of participants reported that they walked for exercise, less than half met the ACR recommendation on physical activity. Exercise is considered a subcategory of physical ac tivity and is specially designed to maintain or improve joint movement, muscle strength , and physical fitness. Only 26% of the survey participants reported that they exercise d in the past year. The majority of people with hip/knee OA had not rec eived weight-loss counseling even if they were overweight Obesity is one of the most important risk factors f or the development of severe OA of the knee.21 This survey found that less than one in four peopl e with knee or hip OA and a BMI >27 (i.e., defined as overweight according to t he US Arthritis Foundation OA quality indicators) had seen a dietitian or attende d a weight-loss program. Long waiting time for joint replacement surgery One of the most frequently reported access barriers to health professionals is the waiting time, especially for orthopaedic surgeons. Among th ose who were waiting for joint surgery, the average delay for their initial orthop aedic consult was six to seven months. In addition, these individuals estimated a delay of an other 18 months from the surgeon visit to the date of surgery, which exceeded the recommen ded waiting time of six months or less in this country.22-24 Among those who already had joint replacement surg ery, more than one in three reported arthritis-related compli cations while waiting. BC Osteoarthritis Survey; January 2008 31 Community education and exercise programs fail to r each people with OA The use of community services is very low among peo ple with OA. For example, The Arthritis Society BC & Yukon Division provides educ ation, exercise program and information support to people with arthritis across the province, but almost 77% of our participants had never used these resources. Furthe rmore, only one in four people had visited a community fitness centre. Since most of t hese services can help to facilitate successful self-care, major efforts will be require d to increase the awareness of these programs among patients and among health profession als. People with severe disability were not assessed for the necessary assistive devices Only 7% of participants who reported severe difficu lties with non-ambulatory activities (e.g., putting on socks; getting in/out of bath) ha d been assessed by occupational therapists, who are experts in prescribing aids and devices to address functional limitations related to OA. Recommendations Improve support for people with OA to engage in exe rcise and physical activities In this survey, participants were only moderately c onfident in their ability to exercise three to four times a week, or to exercise without aggravating their symptoms. The latter can become an additional barrier to exercise. Altho ugh exercise improves OA pain, 25 people in pain may avoid exercise, and therefore, m ay not adhere to the exercise regime. 26 To address this, health professionals can provide guidance and modify exercises according to the individuals' symptoms an d abilities. Also, integrating physical activities and exercise into one's personal lifesty le helps adherence. 15 Health professionals can help a person develop an achievab le exercise plan and encourage the use of a diary to monitor the progress. This strate gy has been shown to be successful in improving exercise adherence in people after corona ry rehabilitation. 27 Information about community exercise programs and facilities should a lso be provided to people with OA. Focus on weight-loss in people with OA who are over weight Improving weight management in this population is c ritical. High body mass index (BMI) is associated with deterioration in the funct ional status in the first three years of follow-up after the diagnosis. 28 Among people with OA who are overweight, even a moderate weight loss of 5% can significantly improv e physical disability. 29 Resources such as Dial-a-Dietitian (www.dialadietitian.org/index.asp ), funded by the MoH, can be recommended to those who require information about nutrition and weight management Educate the public about myths and facts of OA One of the challenges of managing OA is the prevail ing perception that it is a part of aging and that little can be done to slow down the progress of joint damage. 30-32 These misconceptions also likely contribute to the low us e of effective treatments in the OA BC Osteoarthritis Survey; January 2008 32 population. Our findings suggest that future resear ch should be directed to the evaluation of interventions that improve the awareness about t he myths and facts of OA, improve the quality of OA care in the community, and facili tate the use of inexpensive and effective approaches, such as improving physical fi tness and reducing to a healthy weight, as the first-line management. Identify, test and implement alternative models to provide care for people requiring joint replacement surgery A number of health service delivery models involvin g nurses and rehabilitation professionals in advanced practice roles have been developed to improve the waiting time and care for people who need joint replacement surg ery. 33 Examples include the use of advanced practice physical therapist to triage pati ents referred for orthopedic consults, 34;35 or the orthopedic trained therapis ts to provide post-surgical rehabilitation. 35;36 These models may be considered, taking into accoun t the shortage of arthritis health professionals in this province.
