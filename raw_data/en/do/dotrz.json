METHODS Inspection data for pigs slaughtered at one pig -only abattoir in the east of England from January 2010 to December 2011 were obtained from the Fo od Standards Agency (FSA). There were three datasets for each of the batches slaughtered. Data were available for ante- mortem inspection (AMI) of live animals, post-mortem inspections (PMI) of carcase inspection and offal inspection. The batches were ca tegorised as being either from free range systems (fattened outdoors), or from indoor fattening systems. This was determined by the batch slap mark. This indicates the farm of origin. The batch slap marks were compared with a list of the categories of supp liers of pigs obtained from the abattoir management. The data were transferred to a spread -sheet (Microsoft Excel) and manually inspected for errors and anomalies; these were excluded from any analysis by replacing the data as missing. A few of the cond itions identified, namely mastitis and orchitis, were of such low prevalence, with only one or two batches affected, that this was combined with the \"other condition\" categories. The data were transferred to a statistical software package (STATA version 1 2) for analysis. The prevalence of each condition in each batch was determined for the datasets by using the number of times the condition was identified as the numerator and the batch size as the denominator. The proportion of batches affected with a condition was determined by recoding the presence or absence of a condition in a batch as a binary outcome. The two types of finishing systems were then compared calculating confidence intervals and using a test for proportions (Z -test). Confounding by b atch size and season was investigated by comparing odds ratios using the Mantel -Haenszel method. The batches in which the conditions were found were also compared for the two finishing systems. In this case the mean prevalence in the batches that were f ound to have the condition was compared between the systems using a t -test. Due to the number of analyses performed in the comparisons (n=82) any differences were considered statistical significant when P<0.0006 using Bonferroni correction. FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 1 v6 Page 2 of 9 RESULTS The total data available for the analysis contained results from the inspection of 1,220,340 pigs from 7,410 batches from the different rearing and fattening systems In the analysis period, the mean number of pigs in each batch was 164 and 166 pigs for indoor and free range fattening systems respectively. There is only slight variation in the different batch size categories for the different fattening systems (Table A1:1). There was a degree of seasonal variation in the number of batches of pigs slaughtered, with fewer batches slaughtered in late spring and in the summer months (Figure A1:1). The proportion of the batches that were from free range systems was fairly consistent accounting for approximately a quarter (range 19.5 -26.3%) of the batches of pigs sl aughtered. Although batch size and seasonality were considered as possible confounders, when analysed they had no influence on the associations between the conditions found and the fattening systems (data not presented).

Ante -mortem inspection data (Table A1:2). The proportion of batches in which the various conditions were detected was similar for both indoor and outdoor fattening systems, except that there was a significant increase in tail bite and lameness in batches from indoor fattening systems. Indoor fatt ening systems had 26.4% of batches in which tail bite was identified, compared with 5.9% of free range batches, and 46.5% had lame pigs compared with 24.7% of free range batches. There were no differences between the two fattening systems in the mean prevalence of conditions within the batches where the conditions were present. 392 492 522 402 450 436 472 432 573 541 484 549 140 138 154 117 109 130 137 150 141 134 147 168 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Number of Batches Slaughtered Month of Slaughter Indoor Free Range FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 1 v6 Page 4 of 9 Table A1:2: Conditions found at ante-mortem inspection of slaughter pigs from indoor and free range fattening systems ( *statistically significant* difference between systems) Percentage o f the batches affected with the condition (95% C .I.)

There were differences in the proportion of batches with carcases showing oedema and those with hair contamination (Tables A1:3 and A1:4). In i ndoor fattened pigs 25.7% of batches had carcases of pigs with oedema compared with 8.1% for free range batches. FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 1 v6 Page 5 of 9 5.9% of free range pig batches had hair contamination compared with 3.9% for batches of indoor fattened pigs.

By contrast, pericarditis was found to occur in more batches of indoor fattened pigs than free range fattened pigs (60.6% of batches compared with 53.5%). The proportion of batches with other conditions was similar between the two fattening systems. When the prevalence of conditions, found at offal inspection in batches where the conditions occurred, were compared it was found that kidney pathology was significantly higher in indoor fattened pigs, whereas the within batch mean prevalence of hepatitis, milk spot liver, peritonitis, pneumonia and other pathology was higher in free range fattened pigs. These differences were on the who le small except for milk spot liver in which a large difference was found. There was a mean of 21.1% of pigs affected in free range fattened pigs compared with 5.9% in indoor fattened pigs.

The possibility exists that condit ions detected could have been misclassified or detected with a different degree of accuracy depending on who was performing the inspection. This is unlikely to have introduced any significant bias into the analysis as this would likely to have been non -differential, so equal in the two fattening systems compared. The classification of the batches of pigs to the type of fattening system was likely to be accurate as the slaughterhouse had good records of the provenance of pigs; this was in their commercial interests, as free range pigs command a premium. The study only involved the inspection data from one abattoir, which is likely to have only obtained pigs from a discrete geographical region. Potentially this means that the results of the analysis cannot be generalised to pigs slaughtered in other regions, although most of the outdoor fattened pigs are produced in the east of England. The comparison of the different fattening systems revealed that the prevalence of conditions found at inspection were qui te similar between the two. The finding of a higher frequency of batches with tail bite and lameness at ante-mortem inspection in the indoor fattening systems was not surprising. Tail biting in pigs is associated with poorer environmental enrichment and lameness can be associated with poor flooring, so both of these conditions are associated with housing. When it occ urred, however the within batch prevalence was not statistically significantly different between the two management systems. Of interest was the very much higher proportion of batches of pigs with oedema in indoor fattening systems. Oedema can have many causes including liver pathology, cardiac pathology and kidney pathology none of these were excessively elevated in the comparisons to explain this large difference. Again, the numbers of pigs affected within batches where the condition was found were sim ilar between the two fattening systems. Milk spot liver occurred more frequently in free range fattened pigs, with it being detected in more than twice the number of batches of free range pigs compared with indoor fattened ones. In addition, more than a fifth of livers from pigs in which the condition was found were rejected from free range fattened pigs. Again, this is not unexpected as milk spot liver is caused by the migration of the larvae of the intestine worm Ascaris suum through the liver. This migration causes inflammation and haemorrhage which is subsequently repaired by fibrous material leading to white areas in the liver, the milk spots. The eggs of this worm are very resistant and so may persist for very many years in the environment, and s o are more likely in pigs reared and fattened outdoors. Pericarditis was found to occur in more batches of indoor pigs, although this difference is unlikely to be biologically significant. FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 1 v6 Page 9 of 9 CONCLUSION In conclusion, the prevalence of conditions detected on inspection of pigs submitted to slaughter from different fattening systems, are, on the whole, quite similar . Most of the differences can be predicted from the housing a nd fattening systems used and knowledge about the influence this has on the occurre nce of diseases. This similarity would suggest that whatever inspection system was in place , it would be likely be equally effective for pigs from both types of management systems. FS145003 Final report ANNEX 2 v6 Page 1 of 15 ANNEX 2 FINAL REPORT FOR PRO JECT FS 145003 ANALYSIS OF CONDITIO NS FOUND AT POST -MORTEM INSPECTION FOR OBJECTIVES 1, 2, AND 3 The aim of these studies wa s to establish a baseline of the frequency and types of pathological conditions that can be expected to be identified when using visual -only inspection in fattening pigs from non -controlled housing conditions; to do the same when using traditional inspection; and, to compare the baseline values of the frequency and type of conditions found using the two insp ection methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sample size The sample size for the study was estimated, in R http://www.r_project.org , a priori as follows: It is estimated that approximately 120 commercial herds supply abattoi rs with pigs finished outdoors in the United Kingdom (UK), with an average of 15 batches a year and approximately 220 pigs per batch (Quality Meat Scotland, personnel communication). Virtually all outdoor pig finishing units are located in England. The dis tribution of the frequency of occurrence of various pathologies is unlikely to be uniform across farms or batches. For low prevalence conditions it has been assumed that the minimum farm level prevalence is 25% with at least 0.1% of batches affected. All p igs from each batch included in the trial would be inspected; therefore within batch sample size calculations are irrelevant. To allow an estimate of overall pig prevalence (for each sampling period) with a precision of 2% to be made with 95% certainty, a ssuming the worst case scenario (i.e. a true prevalence of 50%), then a total of 10 different farms would need to be sampled, with an aim to include five batches per farm, so that 50 batches in total will be inspected for the study. This would lead to a to tal of 11,000 pigs inspected. Recording of data During traditional inspection M eat Hygiene Inspectors (MHIs) recorded all conditions found on a touch sc reen system. This information wa s then transferred to the plant records from where it can be printed ou t for each batch (identified by the individual slap mark). Data were collected from the FSA records and transferred, by double entry, to a M icrosoft Office Excel Worksheet by project personnel. The data for the conditions found at the visual -only inspectio n point were recorded by MHIs on a recording sheet that mirror ed the FSA r ecords . Identification was again at the batch level i.e. by the individual slap mark. These data were also double enter ed on a Microsoft Office Excel Workshee t by project personnel . All data collected during the trial were stored in the Microsoft Office Exce l Worksheet . Each batch was identified by a unique code (id), date of slaughter, week of slaughter, FS145003 Final report ANNEX 2 v6 Page 2 of 15 slaughterhouse, slap mark, number of pigs slaugh tered, number of pigs inspected and all conditions identified by M HIs by both methods (traditional and visual -only). The number of pigs inspected was equal t o the number slaughtered unless logistical issue s occurred during the recording. For example, if there was no recording available f or traditional inspection then no visual -only inspection was recorded until the system was resolved. This was to ensure that the carcasses inspected by both inspection methods were the same . The conditions were initially stored exactly as observed in the a battoir for recording purposes during the trial. Conditions were then regrouped into categories ready for the statistical analyses. These groups, or categories, were created following the same criteria used for the historical analysis of frequency and type s of conditions identified by post-mortem inspection for fattening pigs from controlled and non controll ed housing conditions (see Annex 1; Objective 4). Statistical analysis All analyses were performed with R version 2.12.1 from R Foundation for Statisti cal Computing. http://www.r_project.org The data used for the purpose of this study consist of paired observations, from the same sample population. For all carcasses from the same batch (a group of pigs coming from t he same farm) both traditional and visual inspection methods were applied to the same carcasses. The frequency of a condition was recorded as the number seen per batch. The number of pigs in each batch was also provided. The statistical methods used accoun t for this. There was only one study abattoir so it was not possible to test if the abattoir influences the results. The trial took place in five separate weeks, between the end of November 2011 and the middle of March 2012. This could be considered as th e same season; nevertheless the effect of season was investigated at the level of week. The number of animals affected, and the frequency (%), or prevalence, of each c ondition found by each inspection method was estimated, and its 95% confidence i nterval s (C.I.) were calculated . The C.I was calculated for the within batch prevalence using a t -test approximation to the normal distribution. The d istributions of the counts for each condition were plotted to see if the y follow a normal distribution. T his was d one separately fo r the two methods of inspection . The proportion of each condition in each batch for the two inspection methods was plotted to see if there was an association between the two methods. The points were coloured by slap mark to visualise if slap mark (farm of origin) might affect the results. Bland Altman plots were used to analyse the agreement between the two inspection methods (the Bland Altman plot or difference plot is a method of data plotting used to analyse the agreement between two dif ferent assays/methods). For those conditions that follow ed a normal distr ibution a paired t -test was applied to see if there were differences between the two proportions and a Pearsons correlation test to see if there was a correlation between the two pr oportions. The season effect was investigated using linear models. The c onditions that did not follow a normal distribution were categorised as absence or presence of the condition for each batch. T he data were analysed as a binary variable. The FS145003 Final report ANNEX 2 v6 Page 3 of 15 McNem ar test was used to see if there were differences between the two m ethods. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated for the visua l-only method using the traditional inspection as the standard because the traditional inspection method is recognised and currently applied in the UK for post-mortem inspection of pigs in abattoirs . The Kappa test was also estimated to analyse the agreement between the two methods. Due to the number of analyses performed in the comparisons (n=20) any differences were considered statistical significant when P<0.00256, using Bonferroni correction. For the purposes of this report it is, therefore, considered that any estimate is statistical ly significant if it has a p value < 0.00256. RESULTS Farms, batches and carcasses included in the trial: A total of 62 batches and 11, 086 carcasses were inspected for the purpose of this study. Twelve different farms were included. Different numbers of batches have been inspected from each farm during the tria l (Table A2:1). Table A2:1: Summary statistics for the numbers of batches inspected per farm over the study period Number of batches inspected per farm Min Mode Median Mean Max 1 4 4 5.2 19 Descriptive analysis of conditions Original conditions from the trial are described in the \"FSA coding of conditions\" column (Table A2:2). There were 179 different types of conditions found by traditional inspection recorded and 179 conditions found by visual -only inspection recorded. They were the same 179 conditions (e.g. \"bile contamination in trotter found by visual -only inspection\" and \"bile contamination in trotter found by traditional inspection\"). These conditions were regrouped into 20 categories, or groups, of conditions. This diff ers from the preliminary report where 19 groups of conditions were identified. Pathology in the pluck was previously included in other conditions. However, on further examination of the data it has been considered separately due to the prevalence and t he differences in prevalence between traditional and visual inspection (1.6% and 4.7%) of the condition. The d escriptive analysis of the data is provided below (Table A2:2 and Figure A2:1).

It is only possible to apply the paired t -test to compare the frequency of detection of conditions by both inspection me thods when the data follow the normal d istribution (Gaussian curve). A n alternative test was used for the four conditions above that did not follow the normal distribution . The rest of the conditions seem to fulfil the assumption of normal distribution .

Paired t test and Pearson's correlation test for conditions with an observed normal distribution There were statistical ly significant differences between traditional (considered the standard method, as traditional inspection is accepted and applied for post-mortem inspection in abattoirs in the UK ) and visual inspection methods for the majority of the condition s analysed FS145003 Final report ANNEX 2 v6 Page 10 of 15 (Tabl e A2:3). There were no statistical differences for pericarditis, peritonitis, skin pathology, joint pathology and grease contamination.

The highest mean difference however, is for hair contamination (8.21%, 95% C .I. 5.63 - 10.79). For this condition more affected carcasses were found with the visual inspection method than the traditional method. For the majority of the conditions there is a statistically significant correlation between the findings by the different inspection methods (Table A2:4 ). The stronges t correlations are for the faecal contamination (0.81, 95% C .I. 0.70 - 0.88) and pneumonia (0.71, 95% C .I. 0.56 - 0.82). If two variables (in our case both typ es of inspection methods) show strong correlation then they are varia bles that tend to vary together, they change in similar way; i.e. when traditional insp ection detects a high number of one particular condition, the visual -only inspection will also detect a high number of that condition.

If the traditional inspection method is assumed to be the gold standard method , there is not a good agreement between the two inspection method s for these conditions as the kappa values were low for all of them . This is mainly because the sensitivity was low for all of them (Table A2:6 ).

FS145003 Final report ANNEX 2 v6 Page 14 of 15 DISCUSSION The trial was carried out in one study abattoir. For logistical reasons a second abattoir in south west of U K was not included . Conditions in pigs might be different depending on the locations of the farms of origin. This may particularly be the case for abattoirs in the south west of England, where bovine TB is present and outdoor pigs might be at a higher risk of contact with T B than indoor pigs. However, most pig farms are located in the e ast of England and due to the large number of outdoor pigs processed in the study abattoir we have covered different areas of production in the UK . The study farms were located in the East of England (in Norfolk and Suffolk ) and in the South West (in Wiltshire ). It will be unlikely that we can generalise the finding to the whole of the UK unless we do further research into the coverage of the study population achieved. As batches of carcasses i ncluded in the trial have been identified (by the slap mark which identifies the farm of origin) and we know the spatial location of the study farms, we could do some further studies of geographical coverage of the study population and the need to include different areas in future studies, if spatial locati on data for the denominator population were available. Industry experts have , however, indicated that such data are \"not easily found.\" The fact that the trial was carried out in only one abattoir might h ave biased the result by the layout of the slaughter line. In the opinion of one of the authors, with extensive experience in various abattoirs in the UK, the layout is not that different to the majority of the abattoirs in UK, if not better. The effect of any such bias is, therefore, considered to be minimal. The trial took place in five separate weeks, between the end of November 2011 and the middle of March 2012. Season does not appear to have any effect on the difference estimates. This is not unexpect ed as the weeks included in the trial were all during the winter and a seasonal effect in the conditions was very unlikely to be present. If different seasons were included in the trial some effect might potentially be expected; however, no such effect of seasonality was found in the historical analysis for Objective 4 (Annex 1). The main reason for the selection of winter season for the set up of the trial was the fact that the presence of certain conditions, such as respiratory conditions (pneumonia, pleu risy), are believed to be higher during the winter months. The trial was not designed to compare the seasonality of conditions, but to study the effect of both post-mortem inspections when those conditions peak. When we compared visual -only inspection with traditional inspect ion it can be seen that there are only slight differences between the frequencies with which each condition was found. It is possible and not unexpected that conditions may be missed by visual -only inspectio n. Although these differences are statistical significant they are less than 3.5% for the majority of the conditions. This implies that at batch lev el there is not a biologically significant difference between visua l-only and traditional inspection, as the actual number of carcases wi th these conditions that were missed (milk spot, renal pathology, and pluck pathology) was very low. The detection of these conditions by vi sual-only inspection might be improved by the alteration of the current layout of the slaughter line to maximise vis ual access to all parts of carcase s and offal (Objective 5; Annex 5). The majority of conditions where traditional inspection exceeded visual -only inspection are conditions in offal; access to the whole offal was substanti ally reduced by the visual -only inspection method. If access is improved to all parts , then it will increase the ability to find these conditions. The same could FS145003 Final report ANNEX 2 v6 Page 15 of 15 be said for conditions loc ated in the back of the carcase and any contamination a ffecting the rear of carcase that is not accessible for visual -only inspection. However, endocarditis will only be detected by incision of the heart. For those conditions with a statistically significant correlation between the findings by the different inspection met hods , such as faecal contamin ation and pneum onia, with an increase in the prevalence of these conditions the difference between visual and tradi tional inspection will remain the same. For the purpose of this study we have assumed that the traditional insp ection method is the gold standard method (as it is currently accepted and applied in all abattoirs in UK for the purpose of hygiene inspection). Ideally, a detailed post -inspection examination of carcases and offal would be undertaken to establish the val idity of this assumption. CONCLUS ION We have found statistically significant differences between the number of carcasses found to be affected by several conditions when examined by traditional and visual -only inspection. For the majority of these condition s, traditional inspection finds more cases. Nevertheless, the difference estimates are low, mostly under 3% and the biological significance is minimal to negligible. Differences in conditions detected by both methods are very small and the impa ct of those differences on the public h ealth is expected to be negligible to very low (Annex 4 Objective 8). Some of the differences might be resolved with alterations to the abattoir line to allow a better and full visual access to all parts of carcase and offal du ring the post-mortem inspection. For further discussion and recommendation s about implementation see Annex 5 Objective 5). FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 3 v6 Page 1 of 24 ANNEX 3 FINAL REPORT FOR PRO JECT FS 145003 METHODS AND ANALYSIS FOR MICROBIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS - OBJECTIVES 6 & 7 The aims of this study are: to establish the baseline of microbial cross contamination (total aerobic plate count, Enterobacteriaceae count, and Salmonella isolation) after visual -only post- mortem inspection and after traditional post-mortem inspection of fattening pigs from non -controlled ho using conditions; to identify any difference in the risk of cross contamination in carcases vis ually inspected compared to those traditional ly inspected through total aerobic plate count, Enterobacteriaceae count, and Salmonella spp. isolation; to establish the baseline of microbial cross contamination with Yersinia spp. after visual -only post-mortem and after traditional post-mortem inspection of fattening pigs from non -controlled housing conditions. to identify any difference in the risk of cross contamination in carcases visually inspected compared to those traditionally inspected through Yersi nia spp isolation. MATERIAL S AND METHODS Sample size The sample size for the study was estimated a priori for each of the different elements to be investigated . Sample size s were calculated with R. http://www.r_project.org . 1. Sample size for detection of total aerobic plate count and Enterobacteriaceae count Due to the variation of microbiological contamination across abattoir s (Zwefel et al., 2005) we h ad to make some assumption s in order to calculate the appropriate sample size for this study. We assume d the worst scenario where 50% of carcases have evidence of cross -contamination with presence of Enterobacteriaceae and we aimed to detect a difference of at least 10 percentage points in the proportion of carcases presented with microbiological contamination between traditional and visual inspection, with a power of 80% and a significance level of 95%. The estimated sample size was 412 swabs for each group (carcases traditionally inspected and carcases visually inspected) with 824 swabs in total. FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 3 v6 Page 2 of 24 2. Sample size for isolation of Salmonella spp. The b aseline prevalence of Salmonella in carcases varies across abattoirs but it remains low (0% % swabbing of carcases in the UK during the EU survey carried out in 200 7 (Anonymous, 2008 )). Assuming a baseline prevalence of 15% of the carcases presented with Salmonella and still aiming to detect a difference of 10 percentage points, with a power of 80% and a significance level of 95%, we need to process 160 swabs for each group (carcases traditionally inspected and carcases visually inspected) , 320 swabs in total. A total 824 samples would suffice to cover all m icrobial counts and isolation. The s ame swabs will be used to test for the total aerobic plate count, Enterobacteriaceae, and Salmonella . 3. Sample size for Yersinia spp. Yersinia is not included in the compulsory microbiological checks in the EU and, therefore there is uncertai nty regarding Yersinia prevalence in carcases in the United Kingdom (UK). I t is believed that the prevalence of Yersinia spp., in carcases in the UK, is as low if not lower than the prevalence of Salmonella (EFSA, 2012). The sample size for this study wa s estimated based on the same assumption used for Salmonella spp. Assuming a baseline prevalence of 15% of the carcases presented with Salmonella and still aiming to detect a difference of 10 percentage points, with a power of 80% and a significance level of 95%, we need to process 160 swabs for each group (carcases traditionally inspected and carcases visually inspected), 320 swabs in total. This is less than half of the total number of swabs to be collected in the trial. Sample collection Swabs were collected after traditional inspection and visual -only inspection of batches of fattening pigs from non controlled housing conditions slaughtered in the study premises. Swabs had to be collected and sent to the diagnostic laboratory (Epidemiology Research Unit [ERU], Inverness) before 11 am every day during the trial, so batches included in the study for collection of conditions found at traditional inspection and at visual -only inspection (but expected to be slaughtered after 10 am that day were not includ ed in the sampling frame , to avoid any delay with the transport of samples to the laboratory. Swabs were collected in five separate weeks, within the period 28th November 2011 to 16th March 2012. Swabs were collected every day from Monday to Friday during those weeks wh en logistically possible. There were only three days of sampling during the first week due to industrial action and issues with the courier . The aim for the study was to collect approximately 200 swabs weekly, 40 swabs daily (20 swabs after traditional inspection and 20 swabs after visual -only inspection) over four weeks of the full trial to achieve the sample size required for the Enterobacteriac eae FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 3 v6 Page 3 of 24 count (n=800). One in every two swabs would then be selected with a random systematic method , every day once the samples arrived at the laboratory to be used for the isolation of Yersinia (n= 400). In the pilot study week (week 1) 160 samples were collected and processed for Yersinia spp. only, t o study the capacity of the laboratory to process the samples for th e rest of the trial. These samples were not processed for total aerobic plate count, Enterobacteriaceae count or Salmonella spp. isolation. In the first two weeks of the full trial (weeks 2 & 3) , samples were taken at the abattoir after t raditional inspection with a different pattern, due to logistic al issues; however, this is not expected to affect the analysis. One in every two swabs was selected on arrival at the laboratory, as described above, to be used for the isolation of Yersinia (n= 199). All samples were processed for total aerobic plate count, Enterobacteriaceae count and Salmonella spp. isolation. All the samples collected (n= 400) in weeks 4 & 5 were processed. All samples were processed for total aerobic plate count , Enterobac teriaceae count, Salmonella spp. and Yersinia spp. isolation.

Swabs were taken according to the FSA protocol described at UKmeat.org [http://www.ukmeat.org/RedMeatCarcasses.htm ] 2. Swabs were taken immediately after visual -only inspection and immediate ly after traditional inspection in the abattoir line (see Figure A3:1); one member of the project team took samples after the visual -only inspection and one after t he traditional inspection. Thes e were the same two project personnel for the duration of the trial, but positions were changed every day to avoid any bia s due to different sampling technique . FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 3 v6 Page 4 of 24 Figure A3:1: A pictorial representation of the microbiological swabbing points on the abattoir line. 3. Swabs were taken fro m different sides of the carcas es to avoid sampling the same area of the same animal after visual -only inspection and after traditional inspection. Swabs after visual -only inspection point were always taken on the left side of the carcass. Swabs after traditional inspection point were alw ays taken on the right side of the carcass. The sides used at each collection point were not changed during the trial for two reasons: firstly, i t was logistically challenging to attempt to swab on the right side after the visual -only inspection in the stu dy abattoir. Secondly, t he potential bias due to a particular side being more contaminated due to handling of carcases was assessed by the authors and the conclusion was that nearly half of the plant staff and MHI s were observed to be left-handed (therefor e the handling of carcases were expected to be balanced between both sides in the overall number of carcases, as staff and MHIs change posit ions routinely), so no bias was expected to influence the estimates. 4. Each swab was immediately identified (labelled ) with date, sampling point (visual -only or traditional) and a unique reference number in order to identify at what point of the inspection time the sample has been taken at (beginning, middle or end of the line ) This formed the basis for the categories of the 'line position ' variable. 5. Approximately 200 samples were collected per week (100 after visual -only inspection and 100 after traditional inspection) , if logistically possible . 6. Daily sampling was spread through the line to enable to collect samples at t he beginning, middle and end of the line. 7. Carcases were selected for swabbing with a systematic random sampling strategy. In order to reach the number of samples required for each day and ensure that samples were evenly spread through the line , carcas es were selected with a routine depending on the number of pigs slaughtered that day, FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 3 v6 Page 5 of 24 the number of samples required for that day and the line speed (e.g. if 400 pigs are slaughtered, 20 samples (at each point) required, and 2 00 carca ses pe r hour line speed: 1 carcase every 6 minute s or 1 carcase every 20 were swabbed to reach the numbers for the day). 8. Once all samples are collected and properly identified for the day, they were placed in the box with frozen freezing blocks and sent to the ERU laboratory in Inverness to arrive within 24 hours. Recording of data The expected number of batches of outdoor pigs and total number of pigs to be slaughtered every day was requested from the Official Veterinarian or the plant manager every morning before starting. The sa mpling strategy was determined, as above, to obtain the required daily number of swabs. Recalculation of the sampling strategy was done if any logistical issue occurred that jeopardised the completion of all samples before 11am (deadline for transport of s amples to the laboratory) once the slaughter started, for example, a delay in the slaughtering or arrival of pigs. Any lot expected to be slaughtered after 10am was excluded from the calculation. Date of sampling, number of sample (VTP001 -VTP160 for the p ilot week and 1 -800 for the rest of the weeks) and point of collection (visual -only or traditional) were recorded every day on datasheets. Number of lots and carcases included in the sampling strategy was recorded in a datasheet. Sample processing Samples were processed in the ERU laboratory 24 hours after collection in the abattoir. Counts and isolation were carried out by two of the project team (see Table s A3:2a & b ). Total aerobic plate count, Enterobacteriaceae count, and Salmonella isolation were carried out using the following methods: 1. Total aerobic plate count was carried out according to the BS EN ISO 4833:200 3 (British Standard Institution, 2003 a) 2. Enterobacteriaceae count was carr ied out according to the BS EN ISO 21528 - 2:200 4 (British Standard Institution, 2004) 3. Salmonella : Isolation of Salmonella was carried out using the BS EN ISO 6579:200 2 (British Standard Institution, 2002 and Health Protection Agency, 2011 b) Yersinia isolation was carried out us ing the following methods: 1.

Food, Water & Environmental Microbiology Standard Method F33: Issue 1.0. Detail of l aboratory technique 10mls of maximum recovery diluent (MRD, Oxoid Ltd, Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) was added to each swab bag and processed in a sto macher for 60 seconds. 10ml of liquid was retrieved from each bag and placed in a sterile, labelled universal container (neat sample). This became the neat sample used to inoculate enrichment broths for Salmonella and Yersinia culture and for enumeration o f bacteria. 1ml of the neat sample was added to 9ml MRD (Oxoid Ltd) and mixed with vortex for 5 seconds. This process was repeated for preparing the decimal dilutions needed for both enumeration techniques. Total aerobic plate count 17ml standard plate c ount agar (APHA, Oxoid Ltd) was added to 1ml of in a sterile Petri dish, incubated at 30\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C for 72 (\u00b13) hours. Those plates with 15 -300 colonies present were counted and these results used to calculate the total coun t present on the origi nal swab, as follows: Number of bacteria = c/ (n1 + 0.1n2) d where c = the sum of colonies counted n1 = the number of dishes retained in the first dilution n2 = the number of dishes retained in the second dilution d = the dilution factor corresponding to the first dilution The result obtained was corrected to two significant figures and multiplied by ten to reflect the volume of diluent added to the swab. Enterobacteriaceae was 1ml of each dilution in a sterile Petri dish, the surface was overlaid with a further 10mls of VRBGA. The completely set plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C (\u00b11\u00b0C) for 24 (\u00b12) hours. Plates with <150 colonies were retained for counting. Confirmati on of the identity as Enterobacteriaceae was carried out on up to five colonies by performing an oxidase test and a glucose fermentation test (Oxoid Ltd). Count per ml of neat sample= (No of colonies confirmed/ No of colonies tested) (Presumptive count/ V olume tested x dilution) The result obtained was corrected to two significant figures and multiplied by ten to reflect the volume of diluent added to the swab.

Following incubation at 37\u00b0C (\u00b11\u00b0C) for 24 (\u00b13) hours, the plates were examined for typical colonies. Up to five suspect colonies re presentative of each broth and agar combination were, when present, subcultured to blood (BA, Oxoid Ltd) and MacConkey (Mac8, Oxoid Ltd) agars to produce pure growth of well isolated colonies , following incubation at 37\u00b0C (\u00b11\u00b0C) for 24 (\u00b13) hours representative colonies from each subculture were tested for autoagglutination and also agglutination with polyvalent O and H antigens (Oxoid Ltd). Biochemical confirmation was carried out on colonies th at produced any sign of agglutination (n=1) or were phenotypically similar to Salmonella but failed to agglutinate. Triple sugar iron agar slants (TSI, Lab M, Bury, UK) were inoculated along with a urease broth (BioConnections, Wetherby, UK). Both were inc ubated at 37\u00b0C (\u00b11\u00b0C) for 21 (\u00b13) hours. Confirmation of identity was continued using API 20E (bioMerieux UK Ltd) screening kit, following the manufacturer's instructions and BA and Mac purity plates were set up. During the sampling at the abattoir, we swa bbed approximately 1 metre (100cm) of the pig carcase with the length of the swab sponge (10cm). That gives us a total surface 10cm x 100cm= 1,000 cm2 (http://www.ukmeat.org/RedMeatCarcass es.htm ). We divided the total counts for aerobic plate and Enterobacteriaceae by 1,000 cm2 to obtain the number of bacteria per cm2.

Up to five suspect colonies from each agar/alkali treatment combination were subcultured to blood (BA) and MacConkey (Mac) agars to produce pure growth of well isolated colonies. Tests to determine the production of oxidase, urease and indole were set up along with a Kligler's agar slant. On Kligler's agar Yersinia produce an acid butt with no gas or hydrogen sulphide production and an unchanged slant. Some lactose positive strains have been reported, none were identified in this study. Yersinia produce urease, may or may not produce indole and do not produce oxidas e. Confirmation of identity was continued using API 20E screening kit, following the manufacturer's instructions and BA and Mac purity plates were set up. It is noted that Yersinia plasmids may be spontaneously lost on culture above 30\u00b0C and during prolonged passage. In this study, no culture occurred above 30\u00b0C and Yersinia was stored at -80\u00b0C as soon as they were identified as such by API20E. FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 3 v6 Page 10 of 24 All swabs collected at the study abattoir during the trial the weeks 1, 4 and 5 were used to isolate Yersin ia. For the weeks 2 and 3, the isolation of Yersinia was restricted to one every two samples with a systematic random sampling approach. A total of 759 samples were processed at the end of the study for the purpose of isolation of Yersinia . Data manageme nt Results from the laboratory were recorded in a spreadsheet. Variables included in the dataset were: abattoir, date of collection, individual id number (swab reference), inspection method (collection point: after visual -only inspection or after tradition al inspection), total aerobic plate count, Enterobacteriaceae , Salmonella , day (4 to 23 ), line position and week . The ' Day' variable is assigned from 1 to 23 for all days we collected swabs during the trial , including the pi lot week where swabs were colle cted (three days collection that week) for Yersinia isolation only (not included in this report ). This was an approximation to batch as the batch was not recorded for each swab. 'Week' was used as an approximation of season (i.e. the week where we collect swabs during the trial.) Data from week 2 to 5 are included in this report as week 1 was used for Yersinia isolation only. 'Line position ': daily swabs were grouped in four groups, according to their position along the slaughter line (from 1= swabs collec ted from carcases a t the beginning of the line to 4 = swabs collected from carcases at the end of the line) . We could expect the contamination to increase in the carcases during the day, so carcases at the end of the day might be more contaminated than carcases at the beginning of the day . Outcome variables assessed in this study were total aerobic plate count, Enterobacteriaceae plate count, Salmonella spp. i solation and Yersinia spp. isolation. The variables were analysed to see if there was any diff erence between the two inspection methods in terms of microbiological counts. Statistical analysis All analyses were performed with R version 2.12.1 from R Foundation for Statistical Computing. http://www.r_project.or g The data used for this study were individual observations, sampled by systematic random strategy from the same study population: carcases from fattening pigs from non -controlled housing conditions. Samples were not intentionally taken from the same carca se after both inspection methods (visual -only and traditional) and measures were in place to avoid sampling the same area of the carcase if the same carcase was sampled at both inspection points by chance. Only one study abattoir was used, so it was not po ssible to test if the abattoir or the FSA team influences the resul ts. The trial took place in five separate weeks from the end of November 2011 to the middle of March 2012, which could be considered the same season; nevertheless the effect of season was i nvestigated at the level of week. There was no recording of the batch (farm of origin of the pigs) from which the samples were taken, Individual batches processed every day were recorded (with an average of two batches used for sampling per day), so varia ble date is used as an approximation o f farm of FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 3 v6 Page 11 of 24 origin, to study the possible effect of farm of origin on microbial contamination . Samples were identified in four groups every day (from 1= at the beginning of the line to 4= at the end of the line) to ident ify the location of carcases on time during the day. This was taken into account in the analysis to study the effect of the position on the line on the results. Potential bias of personnel c ollecting the samples was addressed during the sampling by rotatin g the swab collection position daily. Potential bias of MHIs handling the carcases (different methodo logies of handling and inspection could increase or decrease the risk of contaminating the carcase after traditional inspe ction) was considered and address ed as MHIs were rotated every 20 minutes and different MHIs handled the carcases swabbed for the purpose of this study. Total aerobic plate count and Enterobacteriaceae count Distributions of the counts were plotted in a histogram to see if they followed a normal distribution. This was done separately for the two methods of inspection. Total aerobic plate count and Enterobacteriaceae count variables were transformed into log10 total aerobic plate count and log10 Enterobacteriaceae count to try to fulfil the normality assumption. The mean of the microbial counts with their 95% confidence interval (C .I.) were calculated for both inspection methods. For total aerobic plate count the estimates calculated were the mean of the logs. For the Enterobacteriaceae count the estimates were the mean of the values, as the log scale has a large number of zeros. The student t -test for comparison of the mean for aerobic plate count was applied to analyse the differences between the mean of the count after visual -only ins pection and the mean of the count after traditional inspection . For the Enterobacteriaceae count there were a large number of zeros, so the variable was categorised as a binary variable: presence/absence. For the categoris ed variables (presence/absence) a chi-squared test was used to see if there was an association between these variables and the inspection method. The samples with more than zero Enterobacteriaceae plate count were transformed to log10 and a student t-test was used to compare the means betw een the inspection methods. Linear models were also applied to investigate the association between the inspection method and the microbial contamination of carcases. O ther variables included in the models were inspection method, week, date and line positio n, in order to study the effects of season, farm of origin, and position of carcase in the line. The variables were selected to enter in the multivariable model if P<0.15. Yersinia spp. isolation The outcome variable was categorized as a binary variabl e: presence/absence. For the univariable analyses a logistic regression model (Wald test) was used to test if there was an association between each of the variables individually and the presence of Yersinia . The variables tested in the univariable analyses were: inspection method, week, date , and line position . The aim is t o study the effects of inspection method, season, farm of origin, and position of carcase in the line. Any variables with a p<0.15 in the univariable analysis were selected to be used in the multivariable analysis. A logistic regression model (Wald test) was also used for this , to test if there was an association between the selected variables and the presence of Yersinia. FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 3 v6 Page 12 of 24 All Due to the number of ana lyses performed in the comparison (n=4) w e adjusted the significance level, using Bonfer roni corr ection (n =4) . For the purpose of this study , therefore, we will consider statistical significant any estimate with a p<0.0127 for all tests performed. RESU LTS Total aerobic plate count, Enterobacteriaceae count and Salmonella spp. isolation Farms, batches, and carcases available for sampling A total of 800 samples were collected during the trial for the purpose of this study. 400 samples were collected after visual -only inspe ction and 400 samples after traditional inspection (see Table A3:4 ). A total of 44 batch es from ten farms and 7,931 carcases were included in the sampling frame . The number of car cases, batches and farms are lower than the number used for conditions during the same four weeks, due to logistic requirements . Samples had to be dispatch ed before 11:00 am every day (in order to arrive to laboratory within 24 hours), so pigs from batches included in the condition study, but not expected to be slaughtered before 10:00 am were not included in the selection for sampling. This is not expected to significantly affect the results. The number of total swabs collected for the purpose of the study was slightly lower than the proposed sample size for total aerobic plate count and Enterobacteriaceae . This should not affect the results, as the prevalence actually found in the carcases during the trial was lower than the worst scenario assumption, therefore a lower number of swabs will suffice to reach the sam e power and significance level (80% and 95% respectively).

N o analysis has , therefore, been carried to identify the difference between the risks of cross contamination with Salmonella in carcases from fattening pigs from non -controlled housing conditions in the study abattoir. Distribution of the microbial counts in carcases after both inspection methods Distribution of the count of each microbial contamination of carcases, total aerobic plate count and Enterobacteriaceae count, were plotted to see if they follow the normal distribution. The plots (Figure A3:2 and A3:4) of the variable total aerobic plate count and Enterobacteriaceae count suggested that a log transformation should be applied to both of the data sets (see Figures A3:3 and A3:5).

No difference was apparent in the total aerobic plate counts (Figure A3:6). Figure A3:6: Distribution of log of total aerobic plate count for each inspection method Due to the large number of zeros (565 samples) i n the Enterobacteriaceae count, we categorised this variable into presence/absence and plotted the counts just for the group where it was present (i.e. Enterobacteriaceae count > 0). A slight difference is apparent in the Enterobacteriaceae count between both inspection methods; the microbial contamination with Enterobacteriaceae being lower after visual -only contamination (Figure A3:7). FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 3 v6 Page 17 of 24 Figure A3:7: Distribution of log of Enterobacteriaceae count for each inspection method Univariable analyses There is no statistical difference in the total aerobic plate counts between the inspection methods, u sing the student t -test to comp are the two means (Table A3:7 ).

After categorisation of this variable as absence/presence of Enterobacteriaceae (Table A3:8 ) and using a chi -squared test to test if there was an association between the inspection method and the Enterobacteriaceae detection, there was no association between the categorized Enterobacteriaceae variable and the inspection method (p=0.76) .

This seems to imply that the batch /farm or origin is the only variable that influences the results in terms of aerob ic plate count . We also used linear models to test the category 'presence of Enterobacteriaceae (n=235 samples) ', with the Enterobacteriaceae count as outcome and the inspection methods , weeks, date and the line position as fixed factors . The only statistical significant vari able was the inspection method, imply ing that the inspection method is the only variable that influences the results in terms of Enterobacteriaceae count. For this type of variable (more than half of the samples had zero counts) a zero -inflated binomial model fits the data better. Yersinia spp. isolation Farms, batches, and carcases available for sampling A total of 960 samples (see Table A3:10 ) were collected during the trial for the purpose of this study: 160 in the trial week (week 1 ) and 800 in weeks 2 to 5 , of which 480 samples were collected after visual -only inspection and 480 samples after tra ditional inspection (see Table 1 ). These swabs came from a sampling frame of 54 batches from 12 farms consisting of 9,633 carcases. Only approximately half of the collected swabs were processed f or the isolation of Yersinia during the weeks 2 and 3 . This brings the total number of swabs processed down to 759 (380 after visual -only inspection and 379 after traditional inspection). The number of total swabs collected for the purpose of the study was larger than the proposed sample size for Yersinia (320: 160 after traditional inspection and 160 after visual - only inspection). This should be more than sufficient to reach the same power and significance level (80% and 95% respectively).

For the rest of the trial (four weeks between 16th January 2012 and 16th March 2012) 599 carcase swabs were tested for Yersinia ; a total of three Yersinia enterocolitica were isolated from those carcase swabs. The distribut ion of Yersinia isolated from the samples after both inspections duri ng the trial is shown in Table A3:11 . During the first week of the trial, nine Yersinia were isolated from the FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 3 v6 Page 20 of 24 carcase swabs: seven Yersinia enterocolitica , five (6.25% of samples collect ed that week) after traditional inspection and two (2.5% of samples collected that week) after visual -only inspection; one Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (1.25% of samples collected on that week) after visual -only inspection; and one Yersinia fredericksenii (1.25% of samples collected on that week) after traditional inspection. No Yersinia of any type was isolated in the second week of the trial. During the third week, one Yersinia enterolitica (2% of samples collected on that week) was isolated after tradit ional inspection. During the fourth week, one Yersinia enterolitica (1% of samples collected on that week) was isolated after visual -only inspection. During the fifth week, one Yersinia enterolitica (1% of samples collected on that week) was isolated after visual -only inspection. In total, twelve (1.6% of the total samples collected during the trial) Yersinia were isolated from the swabs: seven (0.9% of the total samples collected after during the trial) after traditional inspection, six of them Yersinia e nterolitica and one Yersinia fredericksenii ; five (0.6% of the total samples collected after during the trial) after visual - only inspection, four of them Yersinia enterocolitica and one Yersinia pseudotuberculosis . Univariable analyses For Yersinia detec tion, the outcome variable w as categorized as presence or absence, regardless of the type of Yersinia . From now on, we consider a sample being positive for Yersinia any sample positive for Yersinia enterolitica , Yersinia pseudotuberculosis or Yersinia fredericksenii . Table A3:12 : Detection of Yersina for the inspection methods Inspection method Traditional Visual Yersinia isolation Absence 372 375 Presence 7 5 The majority of th e samples were negative (Table A3:12 ). There is no statistical difference (p=0. 55) in the Yersinia detection in carcases between the inspection methods (Table A3:12 ). Carcases sampled at the end of the line had more risk of having Yersinia than at the beginning of the line (p=0.09). Carcases sampled in week 1 had more risk of presence of Yersinia than in other weeks (p<0.01). Carcases sampled at two dates (28th and 29th November 2011) had more risk of presence of Yersinia than in the rest of the dates (p<0.03). FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 3 v6 Page 21 of 24 Multivariable analyses The variables at the univariable analyses selected to enter the multivariable model were week, line position and date . In the final multivariable model there was a statistically significant association with the presence of Yersinia for the variable date, specifically the 29th of November 2011 (p<0.001) . Two batches (i.e. two different farms) were processed on that day; one of the farm provided pigs for the rest of the trial and the other one only sent animals on that day. Otherwise, there was no statistical difference (p=0. 55) in the Yersinia detection in carcases between the inspection methods . FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 3 v6 Page 22 of 24 DISCUSSION The EU Regulation No 1441/2007 (Anonymous, 2007) imposes microbiologic al criteria for foodstuffs. Chapter 2 of this Regulation defines the hygiene status of the process by the level of microbial contamination. If we apply these microbiological criteria to the results o f the samples in the study, then as both the mean of the Enterobacteriaceae count and the mean of the total aerob ic plate count were below the lower limit it was considered to be 'satisfactory ' (Table A3:13 ). This abattoir is considered a satisfactory abattoir as far as hygiene is concerned when measured by microbiological checks of carcases after inspection. Table A 3:13: Swabbing criteria for pig carcasses [http://www.ukmeat.org/RedMeatCarcasses.htm ] Total aerobic p late Count Enterobacteriaceae count Salmonella Unacceptable mean log /number of positives is equal to or above 4.3 2.3 5/50 Acceptable mean log is below 4.3 2.3 Satisfactory mean log / number of positives is below 3.3 1.3 5/50 The same level of total aerobic plate (TAP) counts was observed with each inspection method; however, lower levels of Enterobacteriaceae counts were observed after visual -only inspection. The trial was carried out in only one abattoir. The study abattoir w as particularly clean, with a very good protocol of hygienic measures implemented by both the plant personnel and the FSA personnel. Plant personnel and FSA personnel had a very good routine of washing and disinfecting hands and knives on the line. This wa s the norm and was not just due to the occurrence of the trial. This emphasis on good hygiene practice would result in a lower level of any cross contamination of any carcases. The microbiological outcomes of the study (TAP and Enterobacteriaceae counts) w ere not a surprise for the authors, when they compare the study abattoir to other abattoirs that they have visited in the past in the UK . If, as the results of the study demonstrate, a reduction of contamination with Enterobacteriaceae can be achieved by t he use of visual -only inspection in an abattoir with a very low prevalence of contamination in their carcases, it would also be expected to be observed in abattoirs with a higher initial prevalence of contamination i.e. visual -only inspection results in a lower level of any cross contamination of carcases. By using only one study abattoir, we have reduced the study to only one FSA team. As explained above, the hygiene routine of this team is very good. A complete 'hands -off' visual -only system was followed by all MIHs carrying out the trial; this should identify the largest apparent gain that can be made between the two inspection systems. No Salmonella spp. was isolated from any of the 800 swabs processed during the trial. According to the assumption made p rior to the start of the trial, based on the prevalence of Salmonella observed in carcases in UK, (up to 9.64% or 13.5% (depending on the reference - Unpublished data BPEX/FSA WP4 and Anonymous, 2008 , respectively) we expected to isolate some Salmonella spp. The FSA defines the level of Salmonella in an abattoir as unacceptable [ [http://www.ukmeat.org/RedMeatCarcasses.htm ] when Salmonella spp. is detected in more than five out of 50 samples (10%). We collected 800 samples, so even if FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 3 v6 Page 23 of 24 we isolated Salmonella in up to 16 of the samples, the abattoir would have remained within the acceptable range. Swabs were taken in the side of the carcase, as we tried to identify any cross contamination. The study abattoir follows a particularly good hygiene practice and that could contribute to the why we did not isolate any Salmonella. It would also be useful to know more about the disease/infection status of the production units involved in the study and how they compare to both the general non -controlled housing fattening pig production unit population and the controlled housing fattening pig production unit population, with respect to Salmonella disease/infection status i.e. are these particularly clean pigs coming into an abattoir with good hygiene/cross -contamination con trol? Such data are currently not available to us. We would not expect to have experienced any difference in the results had we included all outdoors batches received and processed at the abattoir. Only five batches arrived at the abattoir after 10 am and were, therefore, excluded from the sampling frame . They were not constantly from the same producers, so no bias is expected. The trial has been carried out in only one study abattoir, in the East of England. For logistical reasons a second abattoir in the south west of the UK was not included in the trial. The prevalence of microbiological agents, such as Salmonella and Yersinia in pigs mig ht be different (Anonymous, 2008 ), depending on the locations of the farms of origin. This hypothesis gains some suppo rt from the statistically significant difference in Yersinia contamination presence that was observed , after adjusting for an approximation of farms of origin (date variable) for one particular date: the 29th of November 2011 . On that particular day two di fferent farms were recorded as delivering animals to the abattoir. One of the farms sent animals on most of the days in the following weeks for the rest of the trial. The other farm sent animals exclusively on that day. It is possible that this one farm wa s the source of the Yersinia that was detected. However, mo st of pig farms are located in the e ast of England and due to the large number of outdoor pigs processed in the study abattoir we expect to have covered different areas of 'outdoor' pig production in the UK. To confirm this we would need (as mentioned in Annex 2) either demographic and spatial location data to determine the geographical distribution of 'outdoor' pig production in the UK and to compare it with the production units included in the trial, or (for a more crude approximation) an indication of what proportion of the total processing of 'outdoor' pigs from non -controlled housing conditions is done at the study abattoir. Such data are not readily available. The difference in Enterobacteriace ae contamination between inspection methods was statistically significant after adjusting for an approximation of farms of origin (date variable). Again, further research into the coverage of the target population that was achieved would assist in the asse ssment of the validity of this result and whether it can be extrapolated to the non -study population within the UK. FS145003 F inal report ANNEX 3 v6 Page 24 of 24 CONCLUSION S Carcases from pigs from non -controlled housing conditions in the study abattoir after visual - only inspection have a similar level of contamination with Yersinia spp. t han after traditional inspection , i.e. the level of contamination aft er both inspections is the same . However, a lower level of contamination with Enterobacteriaceae was found after visual inspection than after traditional inspection. The total aerobic pl ate counts are similar, i.e. the level of contamination after both inspections is the same; and no Salmonella spp. was isolated from any carcases. These results suggest that we were able to reduce the microbial load i.e. the contamination of carcases by changing the post-mortem inspection method to a visual system where handling of carcases by FSA personnel was minimised. Total aerobic plate count and Enterobacteriaceae count are commonly used as an approxi mation of any microbiological contamination in carcases. So we can say that the ri sk of any microbiological contamination in carcases is lower after visual -only post-mortem inspection compared to traditional post-mortem inspection. We can conclude that as this result has been observed in a particularly clean abattoir, results are expected to be observed in any abattoir with level of contamination as low as and higher than the study premises. FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 1 of 54 ANNEX 4 FINAL REPORT FOR PRO JECT FS 145003 REPORT OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT FOR OBJECTIVE 8 This purpose of this work was to undertake a formal, mostly qualitative, risk assessment, based on guidelines described by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) , on the impact of the implementation of visual -only inspection for fattening pigs from non -controlled housing conditions and the impacts that this could have in terms of public health, animal health, animal welfare and the allocation of resources We have used a modified CAC risk assessment approach to qualitatively assess the potential change in risks to human (public health via a food -borne route), animal health and animal welfare of a change in the meat inspection method, from the traditional method currentl y employed to a visual -only (hands -off') methodology, for fattening pigs from non - controlled housing management systems i.e. raised outdoors from weaning to slaughter. We have not considered the component of public health risk that is due to occupational exposure. We have used data from previous work, scientific literature, publically available information and our own field study to inform the risk assessment. Based on this information we have taken a cautious approach and considered a worse case scenario. Of the five public health hazards we have assessed (endocarditis, granulomatous lesions, Salmonella spp., Yersinia spp., and the hygiene process indicators - total aerobic plate count and Enterobacteriac eae count ) only two have a revised risk on a c hange in inspection method. The risk for hazards associated with endocarditis lesions changes from negligible to non-negligible , i.e. very low, while from the results of the Enterobacteriac eae count analysis it is possible that the risk of cross -contamination b etween carcases is reduced. Only two animal health hazards were identified and assessed (endocarditis and granulomatous lesions). Again , endocarditis has a revised risk on a change in inspection method from negligible to non -negligible i.e. very low. Despi te the revised risk classification for public and animal health , attributable to the reduced detection of endocarditis lesions by visual-only inspection compared to traditional inspection for outdoor pigs, the fact still remains that outdoor pigs from non -controlled housing conditions present at least the same, if not less (Hill et al. , 2011), of a risk than indoor pigs fro m controlled housing c onditions . Visual inspection is acc eptable for pigs from indoor, controlled and integrated management systems (Anon., 2004 b); therefore there is no reason relevant to the public health risk presented to exclude outdoor pigs purely on grounds of the managem ent system from which they originate. This is also the case for the animal health risk. Action by producers is unlikely to be taken on the basis of information received about endocarditis lesions from post-mortem data feed back. Action would be taken in res ponse to clinical signs in live pigs with associated production l osses and their economic impact for the causal agents associated with endocarditis lesions ( Strepococcus spp, including S. suis & E. rhusiopathiae ). One of the arguments for a move from a tra ditional palpation and incision inspection system to a visual -only based one is that it could reduce cross contamination of carcases that would occur via the hands and knives of meat inspectors. In our field study, no difference was found in the isolation of Yersinia spp. or Salmonella spp., total aerobic plate count or the FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 2 of 54 presence/absence of Enterobacteriac eae; however, when present the Enterobacteriac eae count was lower on carcases that had been visual ly inspected than traditionally inspected, implying less contamination. The abattoir used for the field study had a particularly good hygiene process. It is possible that a change in the inspection method from traditional to visual would lead to a similar result in any abattoir with a level of contamination as low as or higher than the study premises. If the level of contamination is lower, then it could be hypothesised that the potential for cross -contamination would be lower; however, we cannot draw that directly as a conclusion from our study. The primar y benefit of a visual -only system of inspection that encompassed pigs from non - controlled housing conditions would be, in the United Kingdom ( UK), the ability to implement such an inspection system for all pigs . At present although it is theoretically poss ible to do so for pigs from controlled housing conditions, in terms of the regulatory process, such systems have not been implemented because slaughterhouses process fattening pigs from different management systems. From this risk assessment, based on cur rent evidence, we do not consider that there is any appreciable additional risk to public health, animal healt h or animal welfare from visual -only inspection of fattening pigs from non -controlled housing conditions in the UK over and above that which curre ntly exists with traditional inspection.

Such methods of meat inspection are not always suitable for detecting some important food -borne pathogens. Modernisation of post-mortem inspe ction regulations in the European Union (EU) means that, provided that certain requirements are met, carcases of fattening pigs reared under controlled housing conditions in integrated production systems since weaning need only undergo visual inspection (E C Regulation 854/2004). This does not involve palpation or incisions and may reduce the risk of cross carcass contamination. Uptake by the UK pig industry has been low because slaughterhouses accept a mixture of indoor and outdoor reared pigs throughout th e day and the latter still have to be inspected by traditional means. Project FS145 003 Our project - Trial of visual inspection of fattening pigs from non -controlled housing conditions ' - included a field trial of visual versus traditional meat inspection of fattening pigs from non -controlled housing conditions. Batches of such pigs (termed outdoor' or free - range) ' were inspected by both visual and traditional meth ods and carcass sponge samples were taken from a subset of pigs on the slaughter line after each of the inspection points. The conditions found by each inspection method were recorded and compared (Objectives 1, 2 & 3). The microbiological work included total aerobic plate counts; Enterobacteriaceae counts, and the isolation of Salmonella and Yersinia (Objectives 6 & 7). Obstacles to the implementation of a risk -based visual -only inspection system we re also investigated (Objective 5) . In addition, historic data from a full calendar year of traditional meat inspection in the abattoir was analysed , in order to establish a baseline for the frequency of conditions recorded by this method for pigs from different management systems (Objective 4). The results f rom these investigations have been used to inform a risk assessment. Objective 8 is to undertake a formal, mostly qualitative, risk assessment, based on guidelines described by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) , on the impact of the implementation of visual -only inspection for fattening pigs from non -controlled housing conditions and the impacts that this could have in terms of public health, animal health, animal welfare and the allocation of resources. This work is reported here. RISK ANALYSIS Risk analysis consists of fo ur components - hazard identification, risk assessment, risk management and risk communication. The purpose of this work is predominantly risk assessment i.e. to address the first two parts: hazard ide ntification and risk assessmen t (Figure A4:1). Communication is required throughout the process ; however wh ether the risk is acceptable is, ultimately, a risk management decision. Risk management includes the consideration of: the identified and assessed risks versus the potential benefits and the costs; possible options, risk mitigation and reduction measures; implemen tation and subsequent monitoring needs. FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 8 of 54 Figure A4:1: The components of risk analysis There are two recognised, formalised approaches to risk assessment. These are the World Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE, 2004 ) Terrestrial Animal Health Code and that of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC , 1999 ). The stages and terminology used in these systems , and their relationships are described below (Table A4:1). Table A4:1: Comparison of the components of two risk assessment approaches OIE approach Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) approach Hazard identification Hazard identification Risk Assessment Release assessment Hazard characterisation Exposure assessment Exposure assessment Consequence assessment Risk estimation Risk characterisation Objective 8 We were asked to use a CAC approach to the Risk Assessment. This has needed to be modified in order to address the non-public health aspects of the investigation. Hazards have been identified then characterised. Hazard ch aracterisation is a qualitative or quantitative description of the severity and duration of adverse effects that may result from the ingestion of a micro -organism or its toxin in food. A dose -response assessment should be performed if th e data are obtainable (CAC, 1999 ). We give a qualitative description of the characteristics of each organism, identified as a hazard, when ingested by humans. In addition, we describe the general characteristics of the hazard in pigs. Exposure assessment estimates the level of microbiological pathogens or toxins and the likelihood of their occurrence in foods at th e time of consumption (CAC, 1999 ). For public health hazards, whether they arise from animal health conditions or contaminants such as microbiological organisms, the extent of actual or anticipated human exposure will only change if the risk profile of the final (chilled) pork carcass (FCPC) changes significantly and if that change is not combated by existing measures in the food chain after the final (chilled) pork carcass stage. We have investigated the contribution of pork meat to the total public health exposure to organisms that are associated with endocarditis and granulomatous lesions and carcass microbial contamination. For hazards of concern to animal health we have investigat ed the contribution that information derived from post-mortem inspection data makes to the prevention and control of disease in the outdoor pig population. We have then characterised Hazard identification Risk assessment Risk management Risk communication FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 9 of 54 the risk that exists when outdoor pigs are inspected by traditional metho ds. This entails the integration of hazard identification, hazard characterisation and exposure assessment to obtain a risk estimate (CAC, 1999 ). We have then compared this to the risk that exists when outdoor pigs are inspected by a visual -only method. Subsequent to the risk assessment we have then explored potential methods for risk mitigation; taken a look at the impacts and at the potential benefits of implementing a visual - only method of inspection for outdoor pigs, from non -controlled housing conditio ns and drawn our overall conclusions. RISK ASSESSMENT Previous work An assessment of t he risk for humans associated with supply chain meat inspection - the Danish Way ( Alban et al., 2008 ) - did not investigate the difference in production management systems; just that between the inspection methods. From this assessment, it was concluded that : the omission of incisions into the mandibular lymph nodes and the routine openin g of the heart for swine carcas es do not seem to be associated with an increased risk for human health; there could be a positive effect on the working environment and no negative effect on animal health. A qualitative risk assessment (Hill et al. , 2011 ) of the comparative risks to public and animal health from visual inspection of indoor and outdoor pigs concluded that the risk was negligible for all pigs. However, there were insufficient data to assess if there would be a reduction in food -borne risk due to reduced microbiological carcass contamination. Both of these studies utilis ed versions of the OIE risk assessment approach. For a recent EFSA opinion (EFSA 2011b) , on meat inspection of swine , a qualitative risk assessment of foodborne hazards resulted in the identification of four hazards of public health significance from the slaughter of pigs. The risk assessment was conducted using data on prevalence on chilled carcases, incidence and severity of disease in humans, and source attribution of hazards t o pork, with the chilled carcas es as the target. Salmonella spp. were co nsidered of high relevance currently in the EU, while Yersinia enterocolitica , Toxoplasma gondii and Trichinella spp. were considered to be of medium relevance . The risk reduction measures indicated for Salmonella spp. and Y. enterocolitica would also help in the control of a number of other microbial hazards. It was recommended that inspection by palpation and incision should be omitted in pigs subject ed to routine slaughter as the risk of microbiological contamination is higher than the risk associated wi th any potential reduction in the detection of conditions currently targeted by these techniques. However; adoption of inspection without palpation and incision is suggested as one part only of a w ider comprehensive pork carcass safety assurance' system. The scope of the work was to evaluate meat inspection in a public health context; animal health and w elfare issues were considered with respect to the possible implications of adaptations/alterations to current inspection methods, or the introduction of no vel inspection methods that might be proposed. Other issues that relate to the fitness of the meat for human consumption , transmissible FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 10 of 54 spongiform encephalopathie s and the impact of changes to meat inspection procedures on the occupati onal health of abatto ir workers and inspectors, or to controls related to any biological hazards at any meat chain stage beyond the abattoir, and the implications for environmental protection were not included. Two methodologies (qualitative and quantitative) were used ; the fo rmer relied on expert opinion and a review of the literature, and the latter used a three stage epidemiological modelling approach. During current systems of meat inspection, the probability of detection of conditions is often low, par ticularly for non -typical cases. This would be reduced further in the proposed modified system of pig meat inspection although the magnitude of the difference would vary with the disease/condition. It was recommended that this reduced detection probability could be mitigated b y follow -up inspection i.e. when abnormalities are seen with visual inspection then further palpation and/or incision should be conducted. FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 11 of 54 Define the question For the risk assessment the ov erarching questions are : 'How would the risk profile change if fattening pigs from non -controlled housing condition s are visually inspected, in terms of: 1. Public health 2. Animal health, and 3. Animal welfare The impact on allocation of resources is then a consequence of risk management options and decisions that arise from these risk assessments rather than part of the primary risk assessment. The fundamental question is: What is the baseline against which any change in the r isk profile is to be considered? Hill et al. (2011) approache d the problem as follows: Indoor pigs were defined as pigs raised specifically for slaughter indoors since weaning on quality -assured farms'. Outdoor pigs were defined as pigs raised specifically for slaughter outdoors since weaning on quality -assured fa rms'. Pigs reared indoors since weaning (with appropriate Food Chain Information (FCI) and from integrated production systems) can be visually inspected; therefore the risk that these pigs pose to public health and animal health and welfare must be accepta ble. If outdoor pigs' pose the same or less of a risk, in respect of specified hazards, then visual inspection of outdoor pigs must also be acceptable. Their questions were, therefore: 1. What is the relative risk posed by visual -only inspection of outdoor pigs over visual - only inspection of indoor pigs ? 2. What is the absolute risk of visual -only inspected outdoor pigs? Study FS145 003 has not been designed to compare indoor' and outdoor' pigs; rather, it compares the two inspection methods when appl ied to fattening pigs from non -controlled housing conditions. Definitions The following definitions a pply to FS145 003 and this risk assessment : 1. Fattening pigs - a pig raised specifically for slaughter .' 2. Non-controlled housing conditions or outdoor' - fattening pigs raised entirely outdoors from weaning to slaughter. These are often referred to at the abattoir as free-range' or organic' pigs. Within this study the terms outdoor' and free range' are used interchangeably and are used to refer to pig s that have been raised as described above. As far as the authors are aware, all such commercial fattening pigs in Great Britain (GB) are also born in non -controlled housing conditions. They need FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 12 of 54 to be distinguished from outdoor pigs that are raised outdoo rs and enter controlled housing conditions at some point to be finished before they are sent to the abattoir. It was assumed , in the design of the study , that fattening pigs raised entirely outdoors from weaning to slaughter would be more likely to be different to pigs raised totally indoors than fattening pigs raised partially outdoors and partially indoors; therefore they would potentially present the greatest risk, if inspection systems were to be changed. 3. Visual -only inspection - this is an i nspection of the carcas s without any palpation or incisi on of any part of the carcass. It is an inspection modified from the requirements of the European Hygiene Regulation (EC) 854/2004 (Anon., 2004b), in which the carcases are not handled, palpated or in cised, they are only examined visually (See Table 2) . 4. Traditional inspection1 - this is an i nspection of the carcass wher e different parts of the carcass are visualised, palpate d and/or incise d (See Table 2) . This is derived from the requirements of the Eu ropean Hygiene Regulation (EC) 854/2004 (Anon., 2004b). The assumption for FS145 003 is that fattening pigs from non -controlled housing conditions inspected by traditional met hods pose an acceptable risk to public health and animal health and welfare. Thus, if the same type of pigs pose the same or less of a risk (in respect of specified hazards) when inspected by visual -only methods, then these risks must also be acceptable. The first question then changes , from that asked by Hill et al. , (2011) as follows: 1. What is the relative risk posed by visual -only inspection of 'outdoor' pigs over traditional inspection of 'outdoor' pigs? 2. What is the absolute risk of visual -only inspected outdoor pigs? There are two main criteria that will determine whether the risk pr ofile will change with the inspection method. These are: 1. Whether the sensitivity of detecting a condition is affected by the inspection method; if not, then there will be no change in risk; 2. Whether the level of carcass contamination is affected by the insp ection method; if not, then there will be no change in risk. The absolute risks remain as stated in Hill et al. , (2011) : To public health - determined by the relationship between the burden of contaminated meat entering the food chain and the rates of huma n illness attributable to that contaminated pig meat. To animal health - this may alter if there is any change in the information that is available to be reported back to the pig farmers. 1 Meat hygiene inspector (MHI) is the UK term for Official Auxiliary FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 13 of 54 The latter will be determined by the complex relationship between the detection of a condition and the outcome of any action taken due to the dissemination of that information in terms of subsequent cases saved'. In addition, the absolute risk to animal health depends on any other reporting that arises from the post-mortem inspection data e.g . the identification and reporting of notifiable diseases. Risk pathway The risk pathway and, therefore the risks, on farm, during transport, ante-mortem and during the slaugh ter process up until the carcass is presented for inspecti on are assumed to remain constant for all outdoor pigs, regardless of the inspection method used. In addition, the risk pathway and the processes for the final (chilled) pork carcass in the rest of the food chain are assumed to remain constant. We are, th erefore, considering at this point only the portion of the risk pathway from slaughter to the relative risk of the final (chilled) pork carcass.

Hazard identification for Question 1: Is the sensitivity of detecting a condition affected by the inspection method? Previous work This question has been considered in depth by Hill et al., (2011). A shortlist was produced of pig diseases and conditions that could potentially be affected by a change from traditional to visual inspection methods. It did not include conditions wher e detection would be unchanged or that clearly did not pose a risk to human or animal health. A preliminary risk assessment led to the identification of two conditions for which a change in risk to public or animal health might potenti ally occur: porcine t uberculosis (pTb) and endocarditis. The conditions that were s hortlisted are shown in Table A4:3. Table A4:3: Conditions for which detection might be affected by the inspection method and their relevance to a potential change in risk adapted from Hill et al., (2011) Condition Preliminary r isk assessment outcome Comment Endocarditis - usually bacterial (Streptococcus spp, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathia e, occasional parasitic or mycotic lesion) Change (^) in human and animal health/welfare risk may arise. Full risk assessment required because of potenti al serious human health issues , (although very low baseline) and lower sensitivity using visual inspection Further investigation of outdoor -indoor pig prevalence advised; possibility that indoor prevalence is hig her than outdoor. This is not an issue when comparing outdoor v . outdoor; the assumption is that inspection method will not change actual prevalence . Necrosis in lymph nodes - possibly due to infection with Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium avium, or Rhodococcus equi Change (^) in human and animal health/welfare risk may arise. Full risk assess ment required because of the importance of Mycobacterium infections (although very low apparent prevalence) and unlikely to be detected using visual inspection Although apparent prevalence is low in pig s; it is considered to be higher in outdoor pigs. This is not an issue when comparing outdoor v. outdoor; the assumption is that inspection method will not change actual prevalence. Lungworm lesions No change in h uman health risk Unlikely to change (^) animal health/welfare risk as initial sensitivity of detection is low anyway Very unlikely to be detected using visual inspection Pericarditis (acute & chronic) No change in human health risk Unlikely to significantly change (^) animal health/welfare risk Likely to be detected visually; possibly small reduction in sensitivity of detection through visual inspections. Human health risk o nly if due to a subset combination of inadequately cooked meat and an acute case ; most are not pathogens relevant to human health. It was assumed that indoor FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 16 of 54 Condition Preliminary r isk assessment outcome Comment prevalence was > outdoor. Tape worms (cysticercosis) No change in human health risk Unlikely to change (^) animal health/welfare risk as likely to be detected visually when carcass split; possibly small reduction in sensitivity of detection through visual inspections. Human health risk is due to consumption (if meat is inadequately cooked) In the assessment of the risk for humans associated with supply chain meat inspection - the Danish Way ( Alban et al., 2008) - the following potential ha zards were considered (Table A4:4), of which two were further assessed . These two were granulomatous lesions and endocarditis. Table A4:4: Conditio ns for which detection might be affected by the inspection method and their relevance to a potential change in risk to humans adapted from the Danish W ay (Alban et al., 2008). Mandibular lymph nodes Hearts Granulomatous lesions Endocarditis Neoplasm Fungi Grey text = identified but not relevant ; black text = identified and considered to be relevant hazards It has not been considered necessary to repeat hazard identification for animal and public health conditions , given the extent of the work conducted in these two studies and the similarities of their findings. P orcine tuber culosis (pTb) lesions are usually considered as a subset of granul omatous lesions . The prevalence of conditions such as endocarditis and granulomato us lesions are proxy measures for specific organisms t hat may be a publi c health hazard. In the Danish W ay (Alban et al., 2008 ) these hazards were identified as and Hazard identification 1 PAH: the animal healt h associated public health hazards are, therefore, considered to be endocarditis and granulomatous lesions to include porcine tuberculosis lesions. Hazard identification of conditions that might pertain to animal welf are was not part of the Danish W ay (Alban et al., 2008) risk assessment, whereas Hill et al. , (2011) considered only the welfare aspects of the diseases/conditions identified as hazards within the exposure and FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 17 of 54 consequences part of the risk a ssessment (all negligible to very low). Lesions of importance for animal welfare can be identified both during ante and post-mortem inspection. The following were identified in the Overview on current practices of meat inspection in the EU ' (Alban et al., 2011) as procedures by which animal welfare might be assessed in pigs : Inspection of the surface of the skin as well as identification of fractured bones (among others injuries caused during transport of the animals) ; inspection of the gastrointestinal tract, the mesenterium, and the related lymph caudales) hernia) ; inspection and palpation of the umbilical area as well as the joints in young animals. In case of doubt, incisions into the area around the umbilical area are made, and the joints are opened (hernia, umbilical infection). This lesion might be considered of relevance for animal welfare if a high prevalence is observed. inspection of the genitalia (except from penis if it has already been condemned). (Late pregnancy / torsion of testicle / hernia) . Not all of these will be applicable to fattening pigs (e.g. late pregnancy) and the majority are already only assessed by visual inspection during the current traditional i nspection protocol (see Table A4:2). The pr obabilities of detection of typical cases during ante and post-mortem inspection of five welfare conditions were modelled in the e xternal scientific report to EFSA (COMISERV, 2011) on the contribution of meat inspection to animal health surveillance in swi ne. These conditions were lameness, arthritis and bursitis, tail biting and/or amputation, bruising and skin lesions, and Dark, firm and dry (DFD) meat . The probabilities of detection did not change significantly between conventional and visual -only inspec tion methods. Hazard identification 1AW: no additi onal conditions have been identified as hazards for animal welfare . FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 18 of 54 Study FS145 003 Objective 3 The results from this comparison of the baseline values of the frequency and type o f conditions found using visual -only inspection and traditional inspection procedures in fattening pigs from outdoor housing conditions, obtained from the data collec ted during the field trial, help to inform: 1. whether the hazards identified in the previous work (above) are releva nt to the study situation; 2. whether additional hazards are identified, specific to the study situation. A trial was run in one abattoir over five separate weeks during the period from the end of November 2011 until the middle of March 2012 . In this trial 11,086 carcas es of fattening pigs, from 62 batches and 12 farms, from non -controlled housing conditions were inspected using both post-mortem inspection methods (traditional and visual -only inspection). The type, frequency and distributio n of conditions detected by each of the post-mortem inspection methods was established and then compared. The effect of season and farm of origin as potential confounders were investigated in the statistical analyses, as was the effect of farm of origin as a cluster. No s uch effects were found. The analyses were corrected for multiple significance testing. What conditions in free -range pigs were observed in our study at statistically different frequencies by the two inspection methods? At a level of statistical significanc e of P < 0.00256 there were differences in the frequencies found by the two inspection methods for eight of the categories of c onditions (Tables A4:5 & A4:6). These were milk spots, renal pathology (including kidney lesions, kidney pathology and suspect ur aemia), enteritis (including enteritis, colitis and pathology in the guts), pluck pathology (as stated), faecal contamination of the carcass and hair contamination of the carcass and, when analysed as absence/presence, for generalised conditions ) and endocarditis . The frequencies observed were higher with the visual method of detection for hair contamination (visual > traditional) . The frequencies observed were higher with the tradi tional method of inspection for milk spot, renal pathology, enteritis, pluck pat hology and faecal contamination , and for the absence/presence of generalised conditions and endocarditis (traditional > visual) .

On further examination of the data, the only one of the four component conditions that had a statistically significant differen ce between the two FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 20 of 54 inspection methods was suspect pyaemia (absence/presence; McNemar t est p=0.00018, mean of the differences 0.65, 95% C.I. 0.23 -1.1, p=0.0031). In most of the batches where MHIs detected suspect pyaemia, the re was only one positive carcass . However, there was one batch with 11 suspect pyaemia (out of 79) positive carcases r ecorded and another one with six suspect pyaemia (out of 427) positive carcases recorded. These numbers are unexpected, especially so when the general health of pigs arriving to the abattoir is as good as it was obse rved to be in the study. The Meat Hygien e Service (MHS) reported that only 0.35% of carcases slaughtered in British abattoirs were re jected as a whole (whole carcass rejected) in 2005 (NADIS, 2012), mostly due to pyaemia, septicaemia and oedema. Pyaemia was the major ca use, responsible for 55% o f the total rejection of carcases in the UK during that year i .e. 0.19% of all pig carcases; seen in 19 in 10,000 carcases or almost two in 1000 carcases. Suspect pyaemia prevalence in carcases in abattoirs in UK observed in the British Pig Executive (BPEX ) monitoring scheme (BPHS) is lower than 1% of carcases inspected (BPEX, 2008). In addition, in the analyses of historical data from the study abattoir the mean prevalence of pyaemia in batches in which the condition was present in free range pigs was only 1.1% (95% C.I. 1.0 - 1.3). In the opinion of the authors the most likely explanations for the unprecedented numbers (over 10%) recorded at the traditional inspection point in these two batches are due to recording error and , possibly, misclassification. This conclusion is supported by further examination of the data. Neither Generalised conditions' nor suspect pyaemia are, therefore, considered to be a potential hazard. This position is supported as Hill et al., (2011) did not include it in their first round of hazard identification. Do they pose a potential hazard to public health ? Endocarditis cannot be detected by visual -only inspection; therefore, it has to remain as a possible animal health associated public health hazard. Milk spot was not considered by Hill et al., (2011) t o be a hazard as it could be detected visually, did not require palpation and incision and was not thought to be a public health hazard when consumed. Apart from endocarditis, none of the other pathologi cal conditions identified above (renal pathology, enteritis, and pluck pathology ) were considered in their first round of hazard identification, with the possible exception that 'Nephropathy (abnormal kidney)' would be included in our classification of re nal pathology'. Although detection of nephropathy requires both a visual and incision approach , they (Hill et al. 2011 ) identified no public health risk . A difference in the frequencies of faecal contamination recorded between the visual and traditional inspection methods was observed in our study. It is possible that this could be considered an additional public health hazard. It would however be most likely to be considered as a proxy measure for microbiological contam ination, which we have studied directly in this field trial (see Hazard identification for Question 2) and so the question of whether this is a potential hazard will be considered there. Do they pose a potential hazard to animal health ? Although there are statistical differences between the amounts found by the two inspection methods , with traditional inspection frequencies being higher than visual inspection frequencies for seven of the categories of c onditions investigated, this does not automatically me an that there is a potential hazard to animal health. The difference observed FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 21 of 54 may not mean anything in terms of animal health, the disease process, the number of cases, actual prevalence or the potential to save' cases if control strategies are implemente d subsequent to the condition being recorded in the abattoir, i.e. the difference may not be biologically significant, or clinically relevant. Faecal contamination is not a condition that would have a direct or indirect relationship with animal health. Th is leaves milk spots, renal patholo gy, enteritis, pluck pathology a nd endocarditis. Although the pigs were individually inspected by both methods, the number of pigs with a particular condition was recorded at batch level e.g. 3/50 and the frequency calcul ated (%). For milk spots, renal pathology, enteritis and pluck pathology, the difference in frequency found by the two inspection methods was calculated (traditional minus visual) for each batch and the mean of the differences estimated . These mean differe nces are very small (less than 3.5%). T his, combined with the fact that for three of the conditions (milk spots, renal and pluck pathology) there is a within -batch mean prevalence (when present) of more than 5%, and they have a statistically significant correlation between the finding s by the two inspection methods and that for all four conditions there is a high batch level prevalence (more than 50% of batches affected) implies that at batch level there is not a biologically significant or clinically rel evant difference between visual -only and traditional inspe ction i.e. the reduced number of individual affected pig carcases found and recorded when using visual inspection compared to traditional inspection is unlikely to have a significant impact on the a vailability of relevant pathological data to feed back to the producers for these four conditions (milk spots, renal pathology, enteritis and pluck pathology ). Some of the differences observed within our trial between the frequencies found by visual and t raditional inspection may have been due to the total hands -off nature of the study design because access to the whole offal was substantially r educed . This would have affected the ability to detect milk sp ot, renal pathology, enteritis and pluck pat holog y by visual inspection. Even if they are not considered to be significant hazards, a n improvement in accessibility to all parts of the carcass should increase the a bility to find these conditions and decrease the differences. Endocarditis occur s in low nu mbers , at a low mean prevalence within batches and a comparatively low percentage of batches are found to be affected with the condition. In the analysis of historical data from this abattoir the mean within -batch prevalence in batches of free-range pigs, in which the condition was present , was 0.8%. The percentage of batches affected with endocarditis was 3.5% (95% C.I. 2.6 - 4.4). If a condition occurs at a low within -batch prevalence and the detection of it s presence in a batch is reduced when the inspection method is changed from traditional to visual, th en th is reduction in the number of batches being classified as affected will have the greatest apparent impact on a condition that affects a lot of batches i.e. the apparent number of affected batc hes will be reduced. This may have a significant impact on the availability of relevant pathological data to feed back to the producers and, subsequently, on animal health. Whether it actually has a significant impact on animal health is dependent on wheth er producers take action to mitigate or control the causes of the conditions in their herds after receiving such information. Do they pose a potential hazard to animal welfare ? FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 22 of 54 None of the conditions identified in our study would have direct effects on an imal welfare due to any reduction in their identification. They may have indirect effects due to any implications for animal health. Hazard identification 1PAH & 1AH & 1AW: no additional animal health associated public health hazard has been identified fr om our study. No additional animal health associated animal health hazards have been identified . No further animal health associated animal welfare hazards have been identified. Do our study findings support the animal health associated public health haz ards identified in previous work? The original animal health associated public health hazards that were identified in the earlier studies were endocarditis and granulomatous lesions to include porcine tuberculosis lesions . Endocarditis cannot be detected by visual -only inspecti on; therefore, it has to remain as a possible animal health assoc iated public health hazard . We were unable to investigate whether there was a difference in the frequency of granulomatous lesions to include porcine tuberculosis lesi ons identified by visual and traditional methods of inspection as none were observed in the study ab attoir during the study period . So, it too has to remain as a possible animal health associated public health hazard. Hazard identification 1PAH : the original animal health associated public health hazards are, therefore, still considered to be endocarditis and granulomatous lesions to include porcine tuberculosis lesions. Hazard identification for Question 2: Is the level of carcass contamination affect ed by the inspection method? A - Identify the micro -organisms or the microbial toxins of co ncern with food (CAC, 1999 ) Previous work The recent EFSA opinion on the public health hazards to be covered by the inspection of meat (swine) looks at the European Union (EU) situation as a whole (EFSA 2010b) . The BIOHAZ committee identified 15 b iological hazards for which there is evidence that they occur or may occur in pigs in Europe and that they can be transmitted via food to humans. The main transmission pathways considered to be foodborne (Anon., 2000) and so were not included. There is a lot of uncertainty about the public health risk rela ted to consumption of bacter ia that are resistant to antibiotics ; however it wa s considered to be significantly lower than the 15 pathogens listed. It was therefore concluded not to consider this characteristic of microbiologic al hazards in isolation, but as on e of pathogenicity attributes when ranking them, especially for Salmonella and MRSA. A simple preliminary qualitative risk assessment using a ranking algorithm was used to produce a short list' for fresh (chilled ) pork carcas es. Information on source attr ibution based on evidence, the literature and expert opinion suggesting epidemiological links between human cases and pork , was considered as a moderating factor in the final ranking of hazards. There was one final high risk ( Salmonella spp.) and several o f a final *; The latter two were excluded from further FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 23 of 54 consideration as there was n o information on occurrence in ca rcases and human cases in EU. The actual relevance to humans in the EU is, therefore, unknown and it was n ot currently considered rel evant in the EU pig population. However, they are to be monitored in future. Those pathogens ranked as low risk' were excluded from further considera tion. Trichinella spp. is detected by diagnostic testing that uses enzymatic digestion of muscle. This procedure would not be altered by an alteration t o the carcass inspection method. It is not possible to transfer the micro -organism from one carcass to the other by manual handling at inspection and so it is not further considered as a hazard relevant to our situation. Current post-mortem inspection cannot macrosco pically detect Toxoplasma gondii ; it will not be transferred by manual h andling and so it too is not further considered as a relevant hazard. Hazard identification 2 A-PHCM: this leaves the two microbial hazards identified as Salmonella spp. and Y. enterocolitica * *In this EFSA Opinion Yersinia enterocolitica is defined as ...human enteropathogenic Y. enterocolitica with biotype/serotype combinations that have their main reservoirs in pigs, in particular biotype 4/serotype O:3, biotype 2/serotype 9, but 27. In addition to the EFSA Opinion referred to above, there is control and surveillance of the hygiene of the process to reduce the risk of pathogens on the meat. This includes a erobic colony count, Enterobacteriaceae and Salmonella according to Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 of 15 November 2005 on microbiological criteria for f oodstuffs, Annex 1, Chapter 2.1 9 (Anon., 2005).

This aspect of the fi eld trial is not designed to identify additional microbiological hazards. In the same trial as previously mentioned in one abattoir over five separate weeks during the period from the end of November 2011 until the middle of March 2012, m icrobiological checks were carried out after visual -only inspection and after traditional inspection . Carcass sponge sampling was used as described i n Regulation 2073/2005 (Anon., 20 05). Total aerobic plate counts, Enterobacteriaceae counts and culture for Salmonella were performed on 400 swabs taken after traditional inspection and 40 0 after visu al-only inspection. These were taken during the second, third, fourth and fifth four week s of the trial between 16th January 2012 and 16th March 2012. Samples could only be taken from batches and pigs that were expected to be slaughtered before 10am to enable despatch to the laboratory and receipt within 24 hours. Ten farms, 44 batches and 7,9 31 carcases from outdoor pigs were i ncluded in the sampling frame. Only five batches were not included due to their late arrival at the abattoir. Seven hundred and fifty -nine swabs wer e cultur ed for Yersinia: 379 after traditional inspection and 380 after visual -only inspection. These came from all five weeks of the study. Twelve farms, 54 batches and 9,633 carcases from outdoor pigs were included in the sampling frame. Potential biases and confounders were c onsidered during the sampling design, or accounted and adjusted for during the statistical analysis. The analyses were corrected for multiple significance tes ting and P < 0.0127 was considered to be the level of statistical significance. There was: no stat istical difference in the mean of the log10 of total aerobic plate contamination of carcases after the two inspection methods; a statistically significant difference in the mean of the log10 of the Enterobacteriaceae count when present (i.e. >0); the leve l of contamination of carcases was lower after visual -only inspection compared to traditional inspection; no statistical difference in the proportion of Yersinia contamination of carcases found after the two inspection methods; and, no Salmonella spp. wer e isolat ed from any sample in the study. B - Identify other non -microbial carcass contaminants that might be affected by the inspection method. Carcass meat (internal) contaminants In the afore mentioned recent EFSA Opinion (EFSA 2010b) , carcass meat contam inants of public health significance, such as chemical and medicinal residues, were considered. T he CONTAM Panel considered all substances listed in C ouncil Directive 96/23/EC and evaluated the outcome of the residue monitoring plans for the period 2005 -2009. The FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 26 of 54 individual contaminants were ranked into four categories denoted as hi gh, medium, low, and negligible potential concern, after consideration of a number of criteria. Although the present meat inspection system facilitates the implementation of the sampling for such contaminants, their presence or absence is not determined by the current inspection procedures; further laboratory analysis is required. Issues other than those of public health significance but that still compromise fitness of the meat f or human consumption (Anon., 2004 b) e.g. sexual odour (boar taint') will also not be significantly affected by a change in inspection procedure from traditional to visual. Hazard identification 2 B -PH CI: no hazards to public health from carcass contaminants within the carcass have, therefore, been identified. Carcass external contaminants The frequency of presentation of any external carcass contaminants for outdoor pigs should be independent of the inspection method , unless there is the possibility of cross - contamination by the handling required for traditional inspection . In the historical analysis of conditions recorded at ante and post-mortem inspection at the study abattoi r (FS145 003 Objective 4), five types of c ontamination were recorded as post-mortem processing faults. These were blood splash, bile, faecal, grease and hair contamination. Blood splash occurs before or during the stunning and subsequent slaughter process when blood leaves the blood vessels due to an excessive blood pressure or trauma of the vessels. It can be seen in small spots or bigger infiltration of whole muscle. It is not a public health issue, just an aesthetic observation , but may indicate deficiencies with the stunning procedure i.e. have welfare implications. Faeces and bile contamination could lead to cont amination from bacteria within them. The faeces or bile could be from the same carcass or result in cross - contamination from another one. Grease refers to machinery grease; although it is food - grade it could be considered as a potential hazard . Hair contamination is probably only an aesthetic and food quality (rather than safety) issue because pig carcases go through the scalding tank and burner and any remaining hair should be hygienic . Study FS145 003 Objective 3 At a level of statistical significance of P < 0.002 56 there were statistical differences in the frequencies found by the two inspection methods for two of the categories of c onditions that might have some relevance to external carcass contaminants with respect to microbiological hazards (Table s A4:5 & A4:6). These were hair conta mination of the carcass and faecal contamination of the carcass. The frequencies observed were higher with the visual method of detection for h air contamination (visual > traditional) . The frequencies observed were higher with the traditional meth od of inspection for faecal contamination (traditional > visual). The presence of hair contamination (but see above) and faecal contamination could conceivably be associated with presence of microbiological organisms. It is possible that these both could be considered an additional public he alth hazard, i.e. as proxy measure s for microbiological contamination and the co nsequent potential for cross \u2014contamination of carcases. These aspects are studied directly in this field trial by measuring tot al aerobic FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 27 of 54 plate counts and Enterobacteriaceae counts . To avoid double -counting' in the risk assessment they have not been consi dered separately from these counts. Hazard identification 2 B -PH CE: the total aerobic plate counts and Enterobacteriaceae counts will provide direct measures for the hygiene of the process, therefore indirect potential hazards such as hair contamination and faecal contamination are not considered individually. Hazard Characterisation Hazard ch aracterisation is: a qualitative or quantitative description of the severity and duration of adverse effects that may result from the ingestion of a micro -organism or its toxin in food. A dose -response assessment should be performed if th e data are obtainable (CAC, 1999 ). We giv e a qualitative description of the characteristics of each organism, identified as a hazard, when ingested by humans. In addition, we describe the general characteristics of the hazard in pigs. Endocarditis in pigs Endocar ditis is an inflammation of the i nternal lining, or endocardium, of the heart. It can occur after a bacterial infection elsewhere in the body. If the bacteri a circulate in the blood stream (a bacteraemia ) then they may reach the heart and cause an inflammatory response there. Often this i s seen as lesions on the valves. If these lesions are seen in the pig's heart then it indicates that they have been, and may still be, infected with the bacteria . Endocarditis - orga nisms in all animals including people. They may be present as commensal organisms or can cause a range of h uman infection s ranging from sore throat to severe, life threatening infection such as meningitis and septicaemia. Long term out comes of infection c an include e ndocarditis, imbalance and long term deafness. Fatal cases of S. suis are rare , but not unknown. Patients who are immuno -suppressed or have had their spleen removed (asplenic) are known to be a t greater risk from disease. Infection may, rarely, lead to toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which is difficult to treat and can cause multi - organ failure (Health Protection Agency (HPA) accessed July 2012 http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/StreptococcusSuis/GeneralInf ormation/ ) Streptococcus suis is carried in the tonsils of pigs, and pig -to-pig spread is mainly by nose - to-nose contact or by aerosol over short distances. It may be transmitted to the sucking piglet from the sow or from other piglets. Streptococcal meningitis in sucking piglets is sporadic in individual piglets. It may be worse in sucking pigs when the organism has been introduced into the herd for the firs t time, or where it is s econdary to infection with PRRS. Clinical signs are quick in onset; the piglet m ay be found dead , convulsing, or shivering, lying on its side and paddling, with rapid side to side eye movements (nystagmus). S. suis is associat ed wit h a variety of other conditions including septicaemia (infection of the blood), polyserisitis (inflammation of the lining of the abdominal and chest cavities), arthritis, endocarditis (infection of the heart) and pneumonia. It has also been isolated from c ases of rhinitis and abortion. The pattern and relative importance of the different syndromes vary in different countries. S. suis is sub -divided into at least 34 serotypes. They vary in their FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 28 of 54 pathogenicity and the diseases they cause, both between and wi thin types. Some types appear to be non -pathogenic and have been isolated mainly from healthy pigs, some are mainly associated with lung lesions, and some have been isolated from other animal species as well as pigs. Clinical outbreaks in pigs are usually associated with trigger factors such as overcrowding, poor ventilation or weaning. It can be treated with penicillin. Endocarditis - Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae Erysipeloid is rare; in humans it is usually a mild, but pruritic (itchy, intense burning sensation) skin condition caused by the bacterium Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae . The bacteria are introduced accidentally from infected animals through pre -existing skin wounds. Human erysipeloid is largely an occupational disease of slaughterhouse workers, ag ricultural workers, and those in the meat -handling and fishing industries. Occasionally it can present with systemic symptoms such as fever, muscle aches and headache s as well as a skin lesion. A rthritis of the fingers , septicaemia and endocarditis are rar e, but not unknown long term effects . It can be treated with penicillin. There are also effective vaccines available to prevent disease. Pigs are the major reservoir . E. rhusiopathiae colonizes the phary nx of pigs and is shed in the fae ces, urine or oronasal secretions of 30 -50% of healthy swine. It can also be isolated from fae ces, soil, water etc. in an infected animal's environment. Clinical presentations include acute septicaemia and diamond skin disease'. Mortality can be quite high. C hronic forms of infection inc lude endocarditis case of Rhodococcus equi infection in a human was reported in 1967 . While still not commonplace, R. equi has been isolated increasingly, especially as an opportunistic pathogen. Most human infections have been associated with immune system dysfunction , for example due to organ transplantation or infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Concurrently, increasing recognition of R. equi as a pathogen has led to improved laborator y identification of infections . Infections often manifest as pul monary invol vement or soft tissue abscesses and they are associated with significant mortality. Treatment can be challenging, requiring early diagnosis and prolonged combination antibiotic therapy, sometimes in combination with surgical therapy. Necrotizin g pneumonia is the most common manifestation of R. equi infection . Extrapulmonary R. equi infections have and fever of unknown origin, among others. Bacter aemia and dissemination of infection follow from the primary infection site, which is usually the lung http://emedici ne.medscape.com/article/235466 -overview#a0104 R. equi is an important cause of pneumonia in foals. It can infect wild boar and domestic pigs (Makrai et al., 2008) and is commonly found in soil . From the literature reviewed by Hill et al. , R. equi infections do not seem to have an apparent effect on the health, welfare or performance of pigs , being asymptomatic, i.e. there are no clinical signs. No additional information has been found. FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 29 of 54 Granulomatous lesions - Mycoba cterium spp. Human tuberculosis ( TB) caused by M. bovis cannot be distinguished from that caused by the closely related M. tuberculosis (the human TB bacterium) on clinical signs . The course and extent of the disease is the same, as is the treatment in most cases. Symptoms of respiratory TB include weight loss, night sweats, fever and a persistent cough which may contain blood or pus. The treatment of TB in people is long and involves a combination of several drugs (http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1259151943662 ) From the literature reviewed by Hill et al. ,(2011) Mycoba cterium spp infections do not seem to have an apparent effect on the health, welfare or performance of pigs, being asymptomatic, i.e. there are no clinical signs. They are considered a dead -end host (no further transmission occurs) for M. bovis, although there is som e evidence that M. avium may be excreted in the faeces raising the possibility of pig -to-pig transmission. No additional information has been found. Salmonella spp. Salmonella bacteria are widespread in human and animal populations. There are a large (approximately 2500 strains) number of Salmonella serotypes that cause food poisoning, typhoid and paratyphoid fevers in humans. Clinical signs of food poisoning include diarrhoea, stomach cramps and sometimes vomiting and fever, which usually last for four t o seven days and is self -limiting i.e. it clears up without treatment. However, it can be more seriou s and cause dehydration in young children, the elderly and people whose immune systems are not working properly . http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/Salmonella/ In pigs, outbreaks of septic aemic salmonellosis are rare. Salmonellosis can occur at any age but is most common in growing pigs over eight weeks of age. Severe S. Choleraesuis infection occurs typically at around 12 to 14 weeks. Disease is dose dependent, that is, a relatively large number of organisms are require d before clinical signs occur. The Salmonella serotypes that are most like ly to cause clinical disease in pigs are S. Choleraesuis, and S. Typhimurium and, to a lesser extent, S. Derby. Other \"exotic\" salmonella serotypes may infect pigs and be shed in the faeces for limited periods but they usually remain sub -clinical. They may be shed in faeces for several weeks or months with no clinical disease. S. Choleraesuis and S. Derby may be carried for long periods by so ws, the former sometimes causes clinical disease in sows (fever, depression, septicaemia, pneumonia, meningitis arth ritis and diarrhoea) . They multiply mainly in the intestines of young growing pigs but also in some sows. Pigs may become l ong-term sub -clinical carriers , the organisms surviving in the mesenteric lymph nodes draining the intestine. Many such carriers do not shed the bacteria in faeces unless they are stressed. Pigs may be intermittent or continuous faecal shedders of other serotypes but the carrier state is usually short, weeks or a few months and is self limiting. S. Typhimurium and S. Derby are more likely to cause milder disease, the main sign of which is usually diarrhoea. Yersinia spp. In humans, yersiniosis is usually self -limiting and does not req uire treatment, although antimicrobial therapy may be prescribed. Most human illness is caused by Y. enterocolitica . Y. enterocolitica is a relatively infrequent cause of diarrh oea and abdominal pain. Clinical signs vary with age and immune system status. Infection with Y. enterocolitica occurs most FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 30 of 54 often in young children where c ommon clinical signs in children are fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea , which is often bloody. They typically develop four to seven days after exposur e and may last one to three weeks or longer. In older children and adults, right -sided abdominal pain and feve r may be the predominant sign s, and may be confused with appendicitis. In a small proportion of cases, complications such as skin rash, joint pains, or spread of bacteri a to the bloodstream can occur. (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/yersinia_g.htm ). Infection is more common in the winter. In pigs, asymptomatic carriage in the tonsils is high. Clinical disease in pigs due to Yersinia infection is extremely rare. As a cause of clinical disease it is not listed as a V eterinary Investigation Disease Analysis (VIDA) code for A nimal Health and Veterinary L aboratorie s Agency (AHVLA) Total aerobic and Enterobacteriacae counts These do not constitute hazards in their own right. Rather they are measures of the hygiene process on the slaughter line and the potential for cross -contamination to occur. Such cross - contamination could have implications for the risk present, in terms of increased numbers of carcas es affected, for other microbiological agents. As such an indicator they cannot be independently characterised. Exposure Assessment Exposure assessment estimates the level of microbiological pathoge ns or toxins and the likelihood of their occurrence in foods at th e time of consumption (CAC, 1999 ). For public health hazards, whether they arise from animal health conditions or contaminants such as microbiological organisms , the extent of actual or ant icipated human exposure will only change if the risk profile of the final (chilled) pork carcass (FCPC) changes significantly and if that change is not combated by existing measures in the food chain after the FCPC stage. The exposure measured by the prevalence of each agent or condition on or in carcas es at the FCPC stage is a proxy measure for human exposure from pork meat , whereas the actual exposure is t hat just prior to consumption. In FS145 003 we are measuring the obser ved frequency slightly earlier in the risk pathway close to the inspection points. We are assuming that: any further steps in the immediate pathway to the FCPC stage are independent of the inspection method and would not result in a significant change (red uction or increase) in prevalence of each ag ent or condition on or in carca ses; all processes from here up to immediately prior to consumption remain constant, i.e. are independent of the inspection method; the frequency of these conditions or agents foun d during traditional inspection of outdoor pigs constitutes an acceptable exposure. FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 31 of 54 What is the current baseline exposure assessment with the traditional inspection method ? What is the c ontribution to the actual public health exposure of organisms associated with endocarditis and granulomatous lesions in pork meat ? Endocarditis - spp. including Streptococcus suis The literature for Streptococcus suis was reviewed by Hill et al. , (2011). It is found in pigs in the U nited Kingdom (UK) . Human infection with S. suis is rarely reported and only about 150 cases have been reported from the world literature. S. suis infection is rare among humans in England and Wales with only two to three human cases being reported each year. The last fatal case in the UK occurred in a farm worker in 1999, due to S. suis type 14. During 2004 a total of 112 isolates were found in pigs in England and Wales, of whi ch 46% (51) were S. suis type 2, the serotype most commonly associated with human infect ion (http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/StreptococcusSuis/GeneralIn formation/ ). People in direct contact with pigs or pig products are considered at risk. Human infection is thought to occur mainly via cuts or abrasio ns when handling infected carca ses. The main transmission pathways for S. suis were not considered to be foodborne (Anon., 2000) . The bacteria are unable to survive proper cooking processes (Leps and Fries, 2009), so the contribution to human exposure made by pork meat is considered to be negligible. Endocarditis - Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae The domestic pig is the most important reservoir of E. rhusiopath iae, the causal agent of swine erysipelas, although it does cause disease in other species (Wang et al., 2010) . Humans become infected through exposure to infected or contaminated animals or animal products and it is considered predominantly as a disease of occupational exposure. The main transmission pathways for E. rhusiopathiae were not considered to be foodborne (Anon., 2000). The people with the highest risk of exposure include butchers, abattoir workers, veterin arians, farme rs, fishermen, and fish -handlers (Reboli and Farr, 1989). It is estimated that 30 -50% of healthy swine harbour the organism in their tonsils and other lymphoid tissues. However, given that between 2001 and 2006 the Health Protection Agency (HPA 2007) reported only nine cases of bacteraemia in England, Wales and Northern Ireland caused by this uncommon pathogen' and subsequently the most recent report covering 2006 to 2010 (HPA, 2011 a) reports twenty cases {from one to seven/year), the contribu tion to human exposure made by pork meat is considered to be negligible. Granulomatous lesions - Rhodo coccus equi The primary at risk' group of humans is immunoc ompromised people, such as those with HIV-AIDS or transplant recipients. However, given that between 2001 and 2006 the Health Protection Agency (HPA 2007) reported only three cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland of bacteraemia cause d by this uncommon pathog en' [one in 2001 and two in 2004], and subsequently the most recent report covering 2006 to 2010 (HPA, 2011 a) reports two case s in 2008 and one case in 200 9, the contribution to human exposure made by pork meat is considered to be negligible. Granulomatous lesions - Mycobaterium spp.: M. bovis was the only Myco bacteria spp. identified by Hill et al. (2011) as being of a potential risk to humans from pigs. It has not been thought necessary to re -evaluate this, given the short time span since the completion o f their work. From the enhanced TB surveillance data for the countries of the UK FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 32 of 54 http://www. hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/Tuberculosis/TBUKSurveillan ceData/EnhancedTuberculosisSurveillance/TBEnhanced01country/ the number of human case reports for the UK in 2010 was 8,482, a rate of 13.6 (95% C.I. 13.3 - 13.9) per 100,000 compa red with 8,917 [14.4 (95% C.I. 14.1 - 14.7) per 100,000] for 2009. In 2009 there were 35 isolates of M.bovis in humans with 23 of these being in people over 65 years of age . The likely contribution of pigs to this number of cases is negligible (Hill et al. , 2011 ). This is re - inforced by the fact that only 29 porcine tubercu losis cases have been found in eight million carcases inspected in 2010 (Food Standards Agency (FSA) personal communication). In addition, in a 13 year study only one human M. bovis case was de termined to be acquired from an animal source in the United Kingdom (de la Rua -Domenech et al. , 2006). Endocarditis and granulomatous lesions public health exposure assessment summary The food-borne contribution made by pork meat to human exposure to Streptococcus spp. including S. suis is considered to be negligible. The food-borne contribution made by pork meat to human exposure to E. rhusiopathiae is considered to be negligible. The food-borne contribution made by pork meat to human exposure to R. equi is considered to be negligible. The lik ely contribution of pigs to the number of cases of M. bovis in humans is negligible . What is the c ontribution to the actual public health exposure of organisms associated with carcass microbial contamination of p ork me at? Salmonella spp. Salmonella is a major cause of food -borne illness in humans. In 2010, 9 ,133 human isolates were reported to the HPA centre for Infections in England and Wales. This is a su bstantial decrease from the 17, 163 reported in 2001. Of these isolates , 27% were S. Enterit and 46% were other serotypes'. From the 2009 reported human isolates the rate per region varied from 11.3 - 25.3 per 100,000 of the population. (http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/Salmonella/ ). As with the majority of self -limiting diseases, it is likely that this figure under -represents t he total burden of illness attributable to Salmonella spp. within the population. Farm animals and foods of animal origin are important sources of human Salmonella infections. How much of the human cases can be attribut ed to foodborne exposure from pork is not easy to quantif y it is likely to be a proportion of the S. Typhimurium cases and some of the other serotypes.' Hill et al. , (2003) estimated that the risk of illness from S. Typhimurium originating from pig -meat (wh ether via cross -contamination from hands or under -cooking) is low. The expected number of cases of S. Typhimurium originating from pig -meat per year was estimated from the mean risk of illness per serving for each pig -meat product by each of the two exposu re routes (i.e. undercooking and cross -contamination) and the level of consumption of those products. This gave an estimate of 1,687 cases per year in England and Wales. When they compared the estimated expected number of cases to the actual number of repo rted cases in England and Wales in 2001 (and adjusted for under -reporting using data from the UK IID Study ), it suggested that approximately 30% of all FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 33 of 54 S. Typhimurium cases are attributable to pig-meat. However, this estimate should be treated with caution since good quality consumption data were not available. As 30% of 21% is approximately 6 -7% of the total number, if applied to the rates from 2009 this would give rates of from less than one to two per 100,000 of the population i.e. risk is low. The Biolo gical Hazard Panel has assessed the public health risks from Salmonella in pigs and the impact of possible control measures. The assessment suggested that pigs and pork may be responsible for 10 % to 20 % of all human cases of salmonellosis in the EU in 20 09, but with differences between countries (EFSA, 2010 b). Y. enterocolitica* Pigs are considered to be the major animal reservoir for Yersinia strains that cause human illness, even if other animal species, e.g. cattle, sheep, deer, small rodents, cats and dogs may also carry pathogenic serotypes. Infection can be acquired from contaminated food and water (organisms can multiply in food at 4\u00b0C).Transmission pathways include direct contact with infected animals; person to person spread and there is a particu lar association with raw pork and pork products. Preventive advice includes the avoidance of raw or undercooked pork http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/Infect iousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/Yersinia/GeneralInformation/ . Y. enterocolitica is listed as an uncommon pathogen involved in bacteraemia b y the HPA and was isolated from 6 to 15 cases per year between 2001 and 2006 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (HPA, 2007). Y. frederiksenii, Y. intermedia, Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. rohdei have also been isolated on occasion. During this period (2001 -2006) the HPA recorded between 11 and 34 laboratory reports in England and Wales per year of Y. enterocolitica . This f igure was 32 in 2009 with a provisional figure of 19 reports for 2010. (http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/Yersinia/ ) Based on data from the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet), which measures the burden and sources of specific diseases over time, approximately one culture - confirmed Y. enterocoliti ca infection per 100,000 head of population occurs each year . (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/yersinia_g.htm ). In the EU in 2007, yersiniosis was the third most frequently reported human zoonosis with a total of 8,792 confirmed cases (EFSA, 2009 a) with a notification rate of 2.8/100,000 per head of population. Y. enterocolitica was the most common species reported in human cases by MSs and was isolated from 93.8% of all confirmed cases. By 2010, there was a total of 6,776 confirmed cases (EFSA, 2012) with a notification rate of 1 .58/100,000 per head of population and Y. enterocolitica was isolated from 91.0% of all confirmed cases. Fosse et al., (2008) estimated that the mean rate of human clinical cases in Europe per annum attributable to Y. enterocolitica was 2.8/100,000 per head of population per annum with a median of 0.943/100,000. The likely contribution of pigs to this number of cases is not quantified, and we consider it to be high, even though the incidence of human cases in the UK is low . The majority of surveys in pigs at the abattoir determine the prevalence in tonsils; however G\u00fcrtler et al., (2005 ) also investigated iliocaecal lymph nodes and carcases. In a population of fattening pigs where the prevalence of Y. enterocolitica in tonsils at the abattoir was FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 34 of 54 38.4%, the prevalence on the carcass surfaces before chilling was 0.3% and this fell to 0% after chilling. Total aerobic and Enterobacteriacae counts These do not constitute hazards in their own right. Rather they are measure s of the hygiene process on the slaughter line and the potential for cross -contamination to occur. Such cross - contamination could have implications for the risk present, in term s of increased numbers of carca ses affected, for other microbiological agents. As such an indicator, a baseline exposure assessment cannot be independent ly made . Microbiological public health exposure assessment summary The risk of illness from S. Typhimurium originating from pig -meat (whether via cross - contamination from hands or u nder-cooking) is low. The like ly contribution of pigs to the number of human cases of yersiniosis is not quantified, and we consider it to be high, even though the incidence of human cases in the UK is low. What is the baseline for animal health ? i.e. disease prevention and control? What contribution does information derived from post -mortem inspection data have in the prevention and control of disease in the outdoor pig population? Endocarditis - general Endocarditis is not scored or reported ba ck as a condition to producers in either the B ritish Pig Executive (BPEX) British Pig Health scheme (BPHS) or the Wholesome Pigs Scotland (WPS) scheme. Endocarditis - Streptococcus spp. including Streptococcus suis During 2004 a total of 112 isolates were found in pigs in England and Wales, of whi ch 46% (51) were S. suis type 2, the serotype most commonly associated with human infection (http:// www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/StreptococcusSuis/GeneralIn formation/ ). In the VIDA report of yearly trends for pigs between 52 to 92 cases of S. suis were diagnosed per year f rom laboratory submissions in GB in the period 2004 to 20 11 (http://vla.defra.gov.uk/reports/docs/rep_vida_pigs04_11.pdf ). Endocarditis - Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae It is estimated that 30 -50% of healthy swine harbour the organism in their tonsils and other lymphoid tissues. In the VIDA report of ye arly trends for pigs between four and 21 cases of E. rhusiopathiae were diagnosed per year f rom laboratory submissions in GB in the period 2004 to 2011. ( http://vla.defra.gov.uk/reports/docs/rep_vida_pigs04_11.pdf ). Outbreaks of death due to endocarditis has caused 15% mortality in a population of 500 growing pigs (http://www.nadis.org.uk/bulletins/erysipelas.aspx ). Granulomatous lesions - General Granulomatous lesions are not scored or reported back as a condition to producers in either the BPHS or WPS scheme. In the historical analyses of FSA data from the study abattoir such lesions were not classified as a separate category, therefore, if they did occur, they would be part of the other' category. No cases were recorded in the study period itself by either method of inspection. Granulomatous lesions per se are not considered as a recorded condition in post-mortem inspection of animals at abattoirs in UK. They are lesions FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 35 of 54 considered by MHIs to help them reach a diagnosis (e.g. TB) and are not recorded in any official system . If such a diagnosis is reached then the i nformation is used by the authorities as sentinels for TB in cattle. Cattle herds on and around the pig farm will be tested. Granulomatous lesions - Rhodoccus equi In the VIDA rep ort of yearl y trends for pigs, no cases of Rhodococcus equi were diagnosed per year from laboratory submissions in GB in the period 2004 to 2011. (http://vla.defra.gov.uk/reports/docs/rep_vida_p igs04_11.pdf ). Granulomatous lesions - Mycobaterium spp: In the VIDA report of yea rly trends for pigs, between zero and three cases of tuberculosis were diagnosed per year from laboratory submissions in GB in the period 2004 to 2011. (http://vla.defra.gov.uk/reports/docs/rep_vida_pigs04_11.pdf ). Only 29 porcine tubercu losis cases have been found in eight million carcases inspected in 2010 (FSA personal communication). However, there i s no information available about the actual prevalence in the pig population Salmonella spp. An EU -wide Salmonella baseline survey was conducted in 2008. Analyses at country -level demonstrated a strong positive association between the prevalence of Salmonella -positive breeding holdings and the prevalence of Salmonella -positive production holdings, suggesting a vertical dissemination of Salmonella between the holdings. The overall EU apparent prevalence of Salmonella -positive holdin gs with breeding pi gs was 31.8% and 33.3% of the production holdings were estimated to be positive for Salmonella . This prevalence varied from 0% to 55.7% among the Member States. The estimated E U prevalence of production holdings positive for S. Typhimurium and S. Derby was 6.6% and 9.0%, respectively. In the UK the prevalence of Salmonella -positive production holdings was 44% (95% C.I. 37.8 -50.9%, n=191) a Typimurium and 11% (95% C.I. 5.3 -7.9%) for S. Derby, respectively (EFSA, 2009 b). In the VIDA report of yearly trends for pig s, between 67 and 120 cases of s almonellosis due to S. Typhimurium were diagnosed per year from laboratory subm issions in GB in the period 2004 to 2 011. This compares to between zero a nd one cases of s almonellosis due to S. Choleraesuis and 20 to 39 cases of salmonellosis due to Salmonella e not otherwise specified ( http://vla.defra.gov.uk/reports/docs/rep_vida_pigs04_11.pdf ). Y. enterocolitica* From 2003 to 2005 the prevalence in the tonsils of 630 pigs from 45 farms in England of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica was 44% and Y. pseudotuberculosis was 18% with 60% of pigs carrying enteropathogenic Yersinia . Y. enterocolitica was detected on 69% of farms and Y. pseudotuberculosis on 78 %. The prevalence of each Yersinia spp. varied by season, region and type of management system (Ortiz Martinez et al. , 2010 ). The prevalence of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica has also been found to vary between countries f rom 93% to 32% (Ortiz Martinez P. , 2010; Ortiz Martinez et al. , 2011). Clinical disease in animal reservoirs is rare. As a cause of clinical disease it is not listed as a VIDA code for AHVLA laboratories. FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 36 of 54 In a report from EU Member States (EFSA and ECDC, 2011 a), on average, 4.8 % of pig meat units were found positive for Y. enterocolitica in the reporting group and a high prevalence was reported by two M ember States in slaughter batches of pigs . Risk Characterisation Risk characterisation is the integration of hazard identification, hazard characterisation and exposure assessment to obtain a risk estimate (CAC, 1999 ). Risk in a qualitative , or semi -qualitative, assessment is usually expressed in categories. In this assessment we use a modified system from Hill et al., (2011 ) and define the categories as follows: Negligible Risk or the frequency/outcome is so low as to not merit consideration Very low Risk or the frequency/outcome is almost negli gible but cannot be excluded from consideration due to uncertainty or other extenuating circumstances Low Risk or the frequency/outcome is small/infrequent but still worth considering intervention/mitigation Medium Occurs frequently or associated with a modest outcome High Occurs often and/or associated with a significant outcome Very high Almost certain to occur and/or associated with a serious outcome Here we characterise the baseline risk with the current traditiona l method of inspection for both public healt h and animal health (Tables A4:11 & A4:12) and then examine if that risk profile is likely to alter if the inspection method is visual -only as implemented in our study/field trial. Is there a change in the risk profile if the inspection method is changed from traditional to visual -only? As stated at the beginning, t here are two main criteria that will determine whether the risk profile will change with the inspection method. These are: 1. Whether the sensi tivity of detecting a condition is affected by the inspection method; if not, then there will be no change in risk; 2. Whether the level of carcass contamination is affected by the inspection method; if not, then there will be no change in risk. FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 37 of 54 From study FS145003 we have the frequencies of the hazards by the inspection method (Table A4:8). Table A4:8: The descriptive analyses of the frequencies (number=n [%] and where appropriate 95% confidence interval , C.I.) found i n the study abattoir in FS145 003 by the two inspection methods for the hazards identified .

It is estimated that approximately 120 commercial herds supply abattoirs with pigs finished outdoors in the UK, with an average of 15 batches a year and approximately 220 pigs per batch (Q uality Meat Scotland (QMS) , pers onal comm unication ). This would lead to an estimate of approximately 400,000 outdoor finished' pigs processed per year. Virtually all outdoor pig finishing units are located in England. If we assume that these figures above have some degree of accuracy then the 11,086 tri al pigs form approximately 3% of the total annual British outdoor finished pig throughput. Hill et al., (2011) estimated that 5 -10% of the total UK pig production is reared outdoors after weaning. Slaughter statistics indicate that 7, 312, 000 head of pig were killed in 2010 (Lewis, 20 10). Not all of these would be fattening pigs, however the number of boars and sows killed is no longer available. Based on previous FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 38 of 54 years it would be betwee n 100,000 -200,000. This would give an estimate of 350,000 to 700,000 for the total annual British outdoor finished pig population. If we assume: 700,000 outdoor finished' pigs processed are per year; that the frequency of the conditions found in the trial pigs is the same as in the general population of British outdoor f inished pigs (a huge assumption); that a total hand -off' visual -only method of inspection were implemented with a similar visual access and line speeds to the trial abattoir, at a similar point on the line with respect to carcass trimming and dressing pro cedures abattoirs; then, based on the observed overall fre quency from the study (Table A4:10), there is a potential for the total nu mber of undetected hearts/carca ses to be as follows: Table A4:10: The predicted guesstimates of the total annual numbers of hearts/carca ses potentially missed if visual -only inspection was implemented as per the trial conditions and prevalence in all outdoor finished' pigs was the same as per the trial conditions. Hazard Identified Total number of cases potentially detected/missed by inspection method per year Traditional Visual Potentially Missed Endocarditis (1PAH) 1400 350 - 2310 0 1400 350 - 2310 Granulomatous lesions to include porcine tuberculosis lesions (1PAH) 2.54* *based on 29 per 8M ^based on figures from Hill et al., 2011 for both number of cases and visual detection The number of g ranulomatous lesions to include porcine tuberculosis lesions cases potentially missed is not of an order that would change the risk profile for either public or animal health. The number of endocarditi s cases potentially missed is also not of an order that would significantly change the risk pro file for public health . The public health risk arises from the sy stemic bacteraemia for which endocarditic lesions are an indicator. Systemic involvement should be detected by visual inspection and endocarditis may be observed in carcases in combination wi th other lesions that may be detected on visual inspection, thus it is only a proportion of the endocarditis lesions potentially missed that would lead to a carcass that would have been heat treated entering the food chain (i.e. a proportion of 1400). For example in FAO (2010), if there is evidence from the carcass that the pig had a fever it should be condemned. Carcases with ulcerative and verrucose endocarditis with no systemic changes may be conditionally approved and then heat treated but the heart is condemned. If the endocarditis lesions involve fibrous tissue infiltration then the carcass can be approved and the heart only is condemned. We do not have any data on what this proportion might be in the UK with the current traditional inspection . We have, therefore, taken a cautious approach, assumed that it would be 100% and designated the ass ociated FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 39 of 54 risk as non -negligible, despite the numbers above being a worst case scenario (Tables A4:10 & A4:11). The number of endocarditi s cases potentially missed is also not considered to be of an order that would significantly change the risk profile for animal health. While it would have some impact a n impact on the availability of relevant pathological data to feed back to the producers there is no evidence that currently this is either an issue of importance or that they take action to mitigate or con trol the causes of endocarditi s in their herds after receiving such information. This may be du e to the apparent low level of occurrence a nd a corresponding lack of industry concern. In addition, both S. suis and E. rhusiopathiae cause other clinical problems in pigs. We would not miss an increase in their prevalence if we don't have endocarditis as an indicator, because an increase in the prevalence of other conditions would act as indicators. In the historical analysis of data from the study abattoir only 3.5% (95% C.I. 2.6 - 4.4%) of batches of free range pigs were affected with endocarditis and the mean prevalence in the batches in whic h the condition was present was low at 0.8% (95% C.I. 0.6 - 0.9%) However, we have taken a cautious approach, despite the numbers above being a wo rst case scenario (Tables A4:10 & A4:12). In our field study the apparent prevalence of endocarditis by tradit ional inspection at a batch level (i.e. percentage of batches affected with the condition) was significantly higher (19.3% 95% C.I. 10.8 - 31.7) than in the historical data analysis (3.5%, 95% C.I. 2.6 - 4.4%), although the within batch mean prevalence was similar (1.1, 95% C.I. 0.4 - 4.2 compared to (0.8% (95% C.I. 0.6 - 0.9%). The wider 95% C.I. are due to the smaller sample size of the field study.

We have used data from previous work, scientific literature, publically available information and our own field study to inform the risk assessment. Based on this information we have taken a cautious approach and considered a worse case scenario. Of the five public health hazards we have assessed (endocarditis, granulomatous lesions, Salmonella spp., Yersinia spp., total aerobic and Enterobacteriacae counts) , only two have a revised risk on a change in inspection method. One, endoca rditis, changes from negligible to non -negligible i.e. very low, while for the other (total aerobic and Enterobacteriacae count) it is possible that the risk of cross - contamination between carcases is reduced. Hill et al., (2011) determined that the risk o f transferring to a visual -only system was negligible for all pigs. They rated the risk from endocarditis to be negligible, as in their estimate around 300 -400 hearts with endocarditis would be missed per year from all pigs both indoor and outdoor (control led and non -controlled housing conditions) over and above those already missed by traditional meat inspection methods. Our estimate just for outdoor pigs is of the order of three to four times that. This may be a reflection of the uncertainty in the estima tes in both pieces of work. There is also a finding from our study data that cannot definitively be explained : endocarditis was observed by the traditional me thod in our study in almost six times as many batches when compared to the free-range pigs in the historical data analysis from the study abattoir. This did not have a statistically significant farm component but due to the small number of farms (12) that contributed to our study some bias due to a farm' influence may still exist . We cannot completely rule out the possibility of an inspection/study bias as it was not possible to blind the inspection teams. It is however unlikely because to make such a marked effect above the norm when there was the usual frequent rotation of the d uty on study days this would have had to apply to all those doing the traditional inspection. There is no known seasonality for endocarditis lesions. We, therefore, have no clear explanation why this finding was of this magnitude but it subsequently infla tes our estimate of endocarditis lesions missed per year compared to that of Hill et al. , (2011). Despite the very low' revised risk classification for public health attributable to endocarditis and the slight increase in risk for visual hands -off' insp ection compared to traditional inspection for outdoor pigs, the fact still remains that outdoor pigs from non -contro lled housing conditions present at least the same, if not less (Hill et al. , 2011 ), of a risk than indoor pigs from controlled housing condi tions. This is supported by the findings from the historical data analysis from the study abattoir . Here, although the differences were not statistically significant, we found that th e mean prevalence in the batches in which the condition was present for indoor pigs was at the higher end of the values for free range pigs (1.0%, 95% C.I. 0.9-1.1% compared to 0.8%, 5% C.I. 0.6 - 0.9%), and the percentage of the batches affected with the condition was higher (5.2%, 95% C.I. 4.6 - 5.8% compared with 3.5%, 2.6 - 4.4%). Visual inspection is acceptable for pigs from the former type of management systems (Anon., 2004 b); therefore there is n o reason relevant to the public health risk presented to exclude the latter purely on grounds of the ma nagement system FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 43 of 54 from whic h they originate. This is also the cas e for animal health risk. A ction by producers is unlikely to be taken on the basis of information received about endocarditis lesions from post-mortem data feed back. For these causal agents, action would be taken in re sponse to clinical signs in live pigs with associated production losses and their economic impact. One of the arguments for a move from a traditional palpation and incisio n inspection system to a visual -only based one is that it could reduce cross contamination of carcases that would occur via the hands and knives of meat inspectors. This , however , is an area where evidence is sparse and it is difficult to draw robust conclusions. Mousing et al., (1997) suggested that the increase in the number of c arcases not recorded as faecal contamination' in a visual -only system would lead to an increase in the number of carcases not detected that carried Yersinia spp. or Salmonella spp. (based on extrapolation from microbiology of gut contents) although this w ould be outweighed by the reduction in cros s- contam ination from hazardous bacteria , particularly from t he pharyngeal and pluck region. Hamilton et al., (2002) found that on microbiological examination unseen contamination on pre-chill carcases was at similar levels with both inspection methods. The outcomes from our field study demonstrated that although there was a statistical difference in the number of faecal contaminated carcases recorded by each inspection method, the mean of the differences was very small (1.62 % (95% C.I. 0.8 - 2.44%) and it was highly unlikely that this would be of clinical significance. This was confirmed by the microbiological investigations. No difference was found in the isolation of Yersinia spp. or Salmonella spp. total aerobic count or the presence/absence of Enterobacteriacae ; however, when present the Enterobacteriacae count was lower on carcases that had been visual ly inspected than traditionally inspected, implying less contamination. The abattoir used for the field study had a particularly good hygiene process with considerable attention being paid to procedures on the line to ensure this. This was the norm and not due to the presence of the study team. It is possible that a change in the inspection method from traditional to visual would lead to a similar result in any abattoir with a level of contamination as low as or higher than the study premis es. If the level of contamination is lower, then it could be hypothesised that the potential for cross -contaminatio n would be lower; however, we cannot draw that as a conclusion from our study. In this risk assessment we have not considered the component of public health risk that is due to occupational exposure. This would be particularly relevant for those organisms that are considered to be occupational hazards, i.e. S. suis and E. rhusiopathi ae both of which could be contracted by those handling and incising t he hearts to examine them for endocarditis lesions. It is theoretically possible that by moving to visual -only inspection it would eliminate the exposure of meat inspectors to these risks ; however, this is likely to have a negligible effect on public health given the current extremely small number of clinical cases in humans in the UK. It is beyond the remit of this study to assess if the risk assigned to Salmonella spp. and Yersinia spp. within this risk assessment is either acceptable or comparable with that from fattening pigs from controlled housing conditions . References are cited in (EFSA, 2011c) that indicate that for Yersinia , organic farming systems may have a lower within -herd prevalence despite herd level prevalence being similar to that of conventional production units. We have not determined the pathogenicity of the Yersinia spp. found in our field study. FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 44 of 54 It has been considered that finishers from integrated production system s that are kept indoors from weaning will have less variation in disease pattern than finished pigs from other types of production (Alban et al. , 2008) . So our study pigs were fattening pigs raised entirely outdo ors from weaning to slaughter. As far as the authors are aware, all such commercial fattening pigs in GB are also born in non -contr olled housing conditions. There are, however, fattening pigs in the UK that are raised outdoors (non-controlled) and enter controlled housing conditions at some point , to be finished before they are sent to the aba ttoir. We have assumed in the design of the study, that fattening pigs raised entirely outdoors from weaning to slaughter would be more likely to be different to pigs raised totally indoors than fattening pigs raised partially outdoors and partially indoors; therefore they would potentially present the greatest risk if inspection systems were to be changed. It could be argued that this is not the case and that fattening pigs raised partially outdoors and partial ly indoors experience the worst, rather than the bes t of both worlds in terms of disease status ; how ever the authors are not aware of any data with this level of information on origin that are available with which to make such an a ssessment. This became ap parent in the course of sourcing appropriate premises in which to undertake the study. How ever, given the outcomes of this risk assessment and the one by Hill et al., (2011) fattening pigs from such outdoor -indoor/combined management systems would have to be significantly different in terms of disease status order to present an appreciable risk. Risk assessment c onclusions 1. Five hazards that are related to public health and might be affected by the inspection method were identified - endocarditis, granulomatous lesions, Salmonella spp. and Yersinia spp. and the hygiene process indicators - total aerobic and Enterobacteriaceae count. 2. The risk to public health associated with one of these hazards , endocarditis, alters with a change in inspection method. 3. The risk to public health from endocarditis in outdoor pigs from non -controlled housing conditions inspected by a visual -only method is higher relative to the same pigs inspected by t he traditional method (very lo w: negligible). The absolute risk to public health from endocarditis in outdoor pigs from non -controlled housing conditions inspected by a visual -only method is negligible. 4. There is some evidence from the hygiene process i ndicators - total aerobic and Enterobacteriaceae count - that the visual -only method results in a lower l evel of contamination of carcas es than inspection by the traditional method. 5. Two hazards that are related to animal heath and s ubsequently their welfare that might be affected by the in spection method were identified - endocarditis and granulomatous lesions . 6. The risk to animal health and welfare associated with neither of these two hazards alters with a change in inspection method. FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 45 of 54 Risk mitigation measures From this risk assessment , based on current evidence, we do not consider that there is any appreciable additional risk to public health, animal health or animal welfare from visual -only inspection of fattening pigs from non -controlled housing conditions in the UK over and above that which currently exists with traditional inspection . However, we have considered potential mitigation measures that could be considered, if it is perceived that further additional measures are necessary to manage any residual risk. If endocarditis lesions are perceived to represent a residual risk then arrangeme nts could be made to open hearts for inspection, where it is thought to be necessary . If granulomatous lesions are perceived to represent a residual risk then arrangements could also be made to inci se relevant lymph nodes for inspection, where it is thought to be necessary. The difference in the frequencies of faecal contamination recorded between the visual and traditional inspection methods found in our field study may be explained by the position ing of the visual -only inspection point on the line and t he inability to turn the carcass by the total hands off method used. This hypothesis is supported as the re were many occurrences of faeces contaminations in any part except tail that were recorde d by the MHI at the visual inspection point, whereas in the traditional inspection recordings they were mainly of faeces contamination in tail . The visual inspection point was placed earlier in the line than the traditional inspection point, which was at its usual position. Between the two there was the opportunity for plant staff to trim the carcass. Furthe rmore, i t is unlikely that a total hands -off visual -only inspection, even in the usual inspection position on the line, will allow all surfaces of the carcases to be visible. Measures such as strategically placed mirrors or systems that rotate carcases would be needed to facilitate this. Harmonised epidemio logical indicators have been identified and have been proposed for use for food-borne hazards to public health related to pigs and pork such as Salmonella and Y. enterocolitica (EFSA 2011 c). These should form the basis for any further risk mitigation measu res, if it is deemed necessary for these micro -organisms. FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 46 of 54 Impacts What would be the impac t of the introduction of visual -only inspection of fattening pigs from non-controlled housing conditions in the UK on...? Impact on public health On the basis of the evidence available to inform our risk assessment and the previous risk assessment by Hill et al., (2011) the impact on public healt h of the introduction of visual -only inspection of fattening pigs from non -controll ed housing conditions would not be detrimental. In addition, it would be similar, for public health risks associated with endocarditis and granulomatous lesions , to the impact if visual -only inspection of fattening pigs from controlled housing c onditions were to be introduced. For those associated with Salmonella spp. and Yersinia spp. it would be equivalent to the current impact of traditional inspection of fattening pigs from non -controlled housing conditions. Impact on occupational exposure On the basis of the evidence available to inform our risk assessment and the previous risk assessment by Hill et al., (2011) it is theoretically possible that a move to visual -only inspection would eliminate the exposure of meat inspectors , or others involve d on the slaughter line , to occupational hazards. In the case of the bacterial diseases, S. suis and E. rhusiopathiae, this is likely to have a negligible impact on public health. We have no t considered the impacts on other occupational hazards such as tho se as sociated with the use of knives, which could potentially be redu ced by moving to a visual -only inspection system. Impact on animal health We do not consider that, on the basis of the evidence available to inform our risk assessment and the previous r isk assessment by Hill et al., (2011) there would be any significant impact on the animal health status of the population relate d to the introduction of visual -only inspection of fattening pigs from non -controll ed housing conditions . What would be extremely important to be aware of is that it would lead to a significant change in the baseline of the recorded MHS /FSA data. It would be necessary to ensure that anyone who is involved in any data analysis and interpretation is aware of this change i.e. one could not assess trends in the recorded frequency of conditions from before and after (or d uring) any change -over period, as o ne would not be comparing like with like. For example, there is increasing interest in using available data fo r surveillance purposes, or i f information is currently being fe d back to producers based on the MHS /FSA data, they and their advisors would need to be made aware that this was the case. This would also be the case if visual - only inspection of fattening pi gs from controlled housing conditions is introduced. It is not possible to assess with any degree of certainty what impact such a change in inspection methods would have on new disease threats. I t is likely to be at least as low as any of the identified known animal health hazards; however, it remains an unknown, unknown. I n this case ( and the case of any known or re -emerging disease) it would depend on the likelihood of missing the condition i.e. the probability that the disease causes significant patholog y in an inaccessible and/or uninspected part of the carcass that would have been identified as being different' or unusual enough from any currently known pathology if it had been inspected, at a level that prompts further investigation, without FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 47 of 54 having ca used a significant impact in the live animal and so escaping detection by clinical signs, either on the production unit, during transport or at ante-mortem inspection. Impact on animal welfare We do not consider that, on the basis of the evidence available to inform our risk assessment and the previous risk assessment by Hill et al., (2011) there would be any significant impact on the animal welfare status of the population relate d to the introduction of visual -only inspection of fattening pigs from non -controlled housing conditions . Impacts on resources There is not the scope here to complete a full resource impact assessment. On the basis of the evidence available to inform our risk assessment, the o utcomes of this risk assessment, the previous risk asses sment by Hill et al., (2011) and the experience and opinions of the authors, the impacts on the resources r equired related to the introduction of visual -only inspection of fattening pigs from non -controlle d housing conditions would be no different to those related to the introduction of visual -only inspection of fattening pigs from controlled housing conditions . Some consider ations are as follows (Table A4:13): Table A4:13: Potential impacts on resources of the introduction of visual -only inspection for fattening pigs Resource Potential impact of introduction of visual -only inspection MHI time on the line inspecting The tim e that a MHI takes on the line to inspect a carcass is unlikely to be significantly reduced i.e. inspection is not usually the current limiting factor for line speed (ROA pers. opinion). Rotation of inspectors, as is currently the practice, will need to be maintained. Equipment There will be a reduced resource requirement in terms of knives and the means to ensure that they are appropriate for use (clean, sharp etc.). The resources requirement for the recording of observations will not change. Training Additional resources will be required to train existing MHIs to be aware of, competent in, ch ange to and implement a new system. There may be a reduction in resources required to train new MHIs, as knife skills will no longer be required. Operations Any operational/systems requirements for implementation of a change will be an initial additional resource e.g. the revision of operations manuals, SOPs, etc. Other See Other impacts If any additional risk mitigation measures are perceived to be required then these will have resource implications. These might include capital expenditure within the abattoirs to install mirrors or rotating systems; changes to slaughter house procedures such as logistics, ordering of submissions etc, and staff deployment and/or numbers if carcases are required to be presented to the MHIs in a different way; for example , if hearts are required to be opened by a member of staff and then presented to the MHI for a visual inspection of the opened heart. Any such resource implications may have economic implications for individual premises. The resource implications will need to be carefully considered by risk managers with respect to whether they are deemed proportionate to the apparent risk. FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 48 of 54 If endocarditis lesions are perceived to represent a residual risk then arrangements could be made to open hearts for inspection, eithe r for all carcases or where it is thought to be necessary. However, given the low percentage of batches affected with the condition, the low mean prevalence in batches in which the condition is present and the lack of use of the current information for fee dback on animal health status it is difficult to envisage what criteria would be used , or set, on which to make a decision to identify any relevant subset . To make a proactive decision a priori to the slaughter and inspection of a batch of pigs, the criter ia would need to be based on appropriate and relevant information on the disease pattern/status from the production unit and/or from previous post-mortem inspection. What would constitute such information for endocarditis remains to be determined. To make a reactive decision during slaughter of a batch in response to increased visual evidence of systemic bacteraemia is unlikely to be possible without an extremely flexible and adaptive inspection system. The impacts on resources arise from the work neede d to set up, implement and maintain such systems . An increase in resources will be required, the scale and duration will depend on the scope of the system proposed. The current system of Food Chain Information submission would need to be adapted and optimised to achieve the required aims. If granulomatous lesions are perceived to represent a residual risk then arrangements could be made to incise relevant lymph nodes for inspection, where it is thought to be necessary. Again, given the extremely low percentage of batches affected with the condition (none in our field study), and the lack of an appreciable animal health problem in the pig population , it is difficult to envisage what criteria would be used, or set, on which to make such a decision. To make a proactive decision a priori to the slaughter and inspection of a batch of pigs, the criteria would need to be based on appropriate and relevant i nformation: one possibility could be an assessment based on the disease status in cattle in the area of the production unit. The impact s on resources would be similar to those required for addressing risk mitigation measures for endocarditis lesions. There will also be resource implication s if the use of harmonised epidemiological indicators is required to mitigate the perceived risk due to Salmonella spp. and Yersinia spp. Other impacts Although the present meat inspection system facilitates the impl ementation of the sampling for carcass contaminants such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals and their by -products, their presence or absence is not determined by the current inspection procedures but by laboratory analysis. A change from the traditional to a vi sual inspection system will not, therefore, lead directly to any change in the risk profile; however, consideration must be given to whether it would have any impact on the implementation of the sampling protocols for carcass contaminants. Similar consider ation should be given to any potential impact on any other surveillance or survey activity that might currently fall within the possible remit of MHIs; for example - if their skills set is changed (no knife skills required) will it prec lude them from other activities? FS145003 Final report ANNEX 4 v6 Page 49 of 54 Benefits The primary benefit of a visual -only system of inspection that encompassed pigs from non - controlled housing conditions would be, in the UK, the ability to implement such an inspection system. At present although it is theoretically possible to do so for pigs from controlled housing conditions , in terms of the regulatory process, such systems have not been implemented because slaughterhouses process fattening pigs from different management systems. If some require traditional inspecti on and others can be inspected on a visual -only basis, it is simpler to keep to the common process of traditional inspection. Mousing et al. , (1997) concluded that the main benefit of a visual -only inspection sys tem for pigs would ...probably be a reduce d level of cross -contami nation with hazardous bacteria. This is still a debatable point, although our fi eld study provides some evidence for reduced carcass contamination with Enterobacteriacae on carcases where it was present. Mousing et al., (1997) also concluded that an indirect benefit would be a reduction in labour that could be a resource that could be utilised elsewhere. It is not clear on what evidence this conclusion was based. If a visual -only inspection system could be implemented for all fatte ning pigs in the UK, then the benefit would be the initiation of a methodology that could change the emphasis of inspection and form the basis of a system that maximises aspects relat ed to consumer safety, in addition to providing reassurance of the use of sound hygiene processes in production and, ultimately, food safety.

FSA145003 Final report ANNEX 5 v6 Page 1 of 25 ANNEX 5 FINAL REPORT FOR PRO JECT FS145 003 OBSTACLES TO IMPLEME NTATION - OBJECTIVE 5 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The aim of this work was to identify any possible obstacles that may hamper the implementation of a risk -based visual only inspection system and to suggest appropriate adaptations to overcome those obstacles. We have identified ten main areas where potential obstacles to implementation may arise. These include : the development of (and agreement on ) how to classify batches of pigs according to risk; how to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place to process batches of pigs according to their risk classification; the resource implications in terms of alterations to plant layo ut, staff availability and amendments to plant operating procedures to ensure meat quality; maximising the visibility of the carcass and offal while minimising microbial contamination; the potential loss of data for animal health and surveillance purpose s; and, issues associated with change in the job, methods and responsibilities for FSA staff. There are adaptations that could be made to overcome most of these obstacles; some however, will require further work and some will need to involve change managem ent and behavioural change; areas that are outwith the scope of this project. We conclude that the majority of the obstacles identified are the same as those that are expected if visual -only inspection were to be implemented for fattening pigs from control led housing conditions and that any adaptations required would be similar.

Such inspection is now not totally appropriate for the c ontrol of food - borne risks to public h ealth. Historical ly, meat inspection dete cts gross pathological lesions in the carcas e and offal from slaughtered pigs , thus enabli ng the detection and condemnation of meat unfit for human consumption. As traditional inspection is restrict ed to the identification of conditions and/or disease s with macroscopic sign s, it excludes microbiological food-borne hazards , such as Salmonella, Campylobacter , and Yersinia . These potential food-borne risks for public health are not controlled by the traditional inspection methods . Information from farms of origin was not historically available to the official veterinarian prior to the slaughter of the animals. Knowledge about management and other factors on the farm of origin can give indications of the likely health status of pigs sent to the a battoir and it can help to identify any disease or conditions in carca se and offal that might endanger public health. Post-mortem inspection is currently (Anonymous, 2004 b) part of a whole system which inclu des ante-mortem inspection and the lat ter must include information from the farm of origin. The European Commission reviewed the current Meat Inspection legislation (Anonymous, 2000) . They considered some alternative methods of inspecti on for fattening pigs that were included in Regulation (EC) No 1244/2007 (Anonymous, 2007 b). The Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health was asked to review the current inspect ion at slaughterhouses for pigs. They concluded that traditional inspection is limited in its goal to prevent zoonotic infections in humans from fattening pigs processed in abattoirs and they explored alternative post-mortem inspection method s. They added that, not only did traditional in spection not prevent current food -borne risks for humans, but it could increase the micr obial risk by cross contaminati on of the carcases. Abattoir meat inspection is implemented in the United Kingdom ( UK) according to the European legislatio n, Regulation (EC) 854/2004. Under certain conditions , fattening pigs from controlled housing conditions in integrated production systems since w eaning are only require d to be visual ly inspected at abattoirs (Anonymous, 2007 b). This is not the case for fattening pigs fr om non -controlled housing conditions; these still have to be inspected at abattoirs by traditional methods . The present use of farm information delivered to the Official Veterinarian (OV) in the abattoir in the form of Food C hain Information (FCI) , prior t o the slaughtering of pigs , should help to identify h azards before the carcases are o n the line . Procedures to improve the de tection of specific conditions that might be at a higher risk of occurring in a particular lot coming f rom a farm with a history of a condition , e.g. with a high prevalence of Salmonella , can then be implemented for that lot. This use of FCI is a process introduced in the UK, by the F ood Standards Agency (FSA), for pigs in 1st January 2008 as required by Regulation (EC) No. 853/2004 ( Anonymous, 2004 a), in order to improve the quality of the ante-mortem inspection in animals prior to slaughte r. Information must be sent by producers at least 24 hours before the arrival of the animals to the abattoir. Information regarding the farm of ori gin is included FSA145003 Final report ANNEX 5 v6 Page 5 of 25 to help the OV to decide if any further inspection or test s are needed during the inspection of animals/carcases to declare them fit for human consumption. It is believed that there is better control of the health of the animals at farm level, if pigs are housed in controlled conditions (Anonymous, 2011) . The prevalence of c ertain diseases affecting public health (such as tuberculosis (TB) or Trichinella ) is also believed to be lower in pigs from controlled housing conditions, than in out door pigs, as they are not exposed to sources of disease . If this is not the case and the risk from batches of pigs raised under non- controlled housing conditions is not higher than that of batches of pigs coming from controlled housing conditions , then ou tdoor pigs can also be included in the visual -only inspection process. The aim of Project FS145 003 was to investigate the implications of changing the inspection method, from the traditional method to a visual -only method, for fattening pigs from non- controlled housing conditions in the UK. OBJECTIVE S The objectives of this part of the study we re: To identify any possible obstacle , at any level, that might hamper the implementation of visual -only inspection system for fattening pigs from non -controlled housing systems in abattoirs. To suggest any appropriate adaptation of the visual -only inspection that will help to overcome the o bstacles identified. For those conditions where visual -only inspection appears to be insufficient compared to traditional meat inspection a risk analysis approach will be carried out to identify strategies to improve the detection level of visual -only insp ection . Particular s of inspection during the trial The v isual-only post-mortem inspection carried out during the trial is different to the proposed visual -only inspection that would be implemented in abattoir s, if a change of inspection method was to be applied. Due to the nature of the study, no handling of the carcase and/or offal was permitted by Meat Hygiene Inspectors (MHIs)1 involved in the visual -only inspection during the trial . Microbiological swabs were collected after both inspection s as part of the tr ial (Annex 3) so the visual -only inspection was restricted to only visual inspectio n, with no handling of carcases i.e. a hands -off inspection. The visual -only inspection proposed for future implementation (Huey, 2012 ) would be a form of risk -based inspection, where: Ante-mortem inspection would include not only an inspection of the live animals but also the consideration of the post-mortem inspection results of previous batches of pigs from the same source and the FCI information provid ed. 1 Meat Hygiene Inspectors is the UK term for Official Auxiliaries FSA145003 Final report ANNEX 5 v6 Page 6 of 25 If the batch of pigs wa s classified during the ante-mortem inspection as low risk and there wa s no reason to suspect that there would be conditions dur ing the inspection that require any further inspection i.e. Officials would not need to palpate and/o r incise any part of the carcase and/or offal during post-mortem inspection to carry out their inspection: then the batch will undergo ONLY VISUAL INSPECTION . If the batch of pigs wa s classified during ante-mortem inspection as high risk and/or there wa s reason to suspect that there would be conditions that require any further inspection i.e. Official would need to palpate and/or incise any part of the carcase/offal during post-mortem inspection to carry out their inspection: then the batch will undergo VISUAL , PALPATION AND INCISION INSPECTION (referred to from here on as further inspection ). For example: animals coming from batches with a high risk (e.g. a previous history of the conditions in th e abattoir) of tumours might undergo further incisions of lumps found in the carcase by Official s to identify them as potential tumours. One potential method of classifi cation of batches, to enable the official inspectors to sp ecify the risk and therefore ensure the appropriate method of post-mortem inspection for each batch , could be to consider two levels of risk . This is an example for illustrative purposes only, not a recommendation. i. Low risk: No current ly recorded presence in the herd of origin of any conditions such as abnormal high mortality, Salmonella, or any disease d iagnosed or suspect in the herd and a p revious ly low presence /absence of post-mortem conditions identified in the abattoir in recent slaughter batches of animals from the herd. ii. High risk: Recorded p resence in the herd of origin of any conditions such as abnormal high mortality, Salmonella, or any disease d iagnosed or suspect in the herd and a p revious ly high frequency of post-mortem conditions identified in the abattoir in recent slaughter batches of animal s from the herd. For the purpose of the study , no herd categorisation according to risk was carried out during the trial. This i s an area that needs more work (Annex 4). Obstacle 1 : The development of appropriate criteria , on which relevant parties agree , in order to classify the risk status of batches of pigs is a potential obstacle to implementation of a risk -based inspection system. Adaptation 1: Further work is required We include in this report any potential obstacle to the implementation of risk-based visual - only inspection as it would be implemente d were the system to be changed . This will include some obstacle s not found during the trial as a consequence of the alterations made, but expected to be present if t he whole method was implemented i.e. including the classification of the risk level of the batch at ante-mortem inspection.

Analysis of the impact for public health, animal health and w elfare of those conditions under -detected by visual -only inspec tion compared to traditional inspection. vi. Discussion of possible and practical strategies to improve the detection of the above conditions where public health, animal h ealth and welfare are reduced. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Decision tree (flow chart) for tra ditional and visual -only inspection We have drawn a decision tree for traditional inspection (see Figure A5:1), as it is currently implemented in abattoirs in the UK for fattening pigs, and one for the alternative inspection method as it would be if a risk-based visual inspection system (Figure A5:2) was implemented. In the visual inspection decision tree we h ave identified three steps that were not present in traditional inspection: FSA145003 Final report ANNEX 5 v6 Page 8 of 25 - Analysis of the risk status of a batch of pigs prior to slaughter - Further inspection could be required for certain batches (high risk pigs) - Further need for handling of carca sses and/or offal by abattoir personnel In order to ensure that visual inspection is successfully impleme nted these new procedures would have to be addressed at each abattoir. These new procedures are the same as those that would be expect ed to be required if visual -only inspection were implemented in fattening pigs from controlled housing conditions (which is deemed acceptable in the UK but not implemented , for logistical reasons) . We analysed the needs for these new procedures together with other issues detected during the trial.

FSA145003 Final report ANNEX 5 v6 Page 12 of 25 Identification of obstacles and possible solutions (including the ones identified in the decision tree) 1. Changes to FCI (includ ed as part of the current ante-mortem inspection ) As discussed earlier, the analysis of FCI as part of the ante-mortem inspection is essential if a new method of post-mortem inspection is to be based on risk. Decisions would be made prior to animals arrival at the abattoir in order to adapt the inspection to the perceived risks from d ifferent batches and/or farms. The a nalysis of FCI from different batches and/or farms, at least 24 hours before arrival for slaughter, may lead to the conclusio n that further inspection of carcases is required, i.e. of those with a perceived higher risk of conditions which might affect the fitness for human consumption. FCI play s an important role in the detection of conditions/diseases during the post-mortem inspection. Healthier animals are normally taken to the a battoir, leaving the sick ones o n the farm of origin ( there is a welfare pre -requisite of fitness to travel and health , in order to be transported and to be eligible for slaughter , respectively ). Animals sent for slaughter should appear healthy; however they may still have an underlying problem. It may be more difficult to identify them as unfi t for human consumption during post-mortem inspection , if the latter is visual -only. When the information from the rest of the herd is available as FCI to the Official at the abattoir, procedures might be put in place to increase the likelihood of detecting conditions/diseases (risk -based inspection). These procedures might vary depending on the conditions expecte d to be present, e.g. if the presence of clinical signs indicative of infection with organisms known to lead to endocarditis are recorded and so endocarditis is expect ed to be present or occur at a high frequency in the batches, the n opening of hearts prio r to the Officials post-mortem inspection may be required ; or if due to prior knowledge of the history of the herd, a high prevalence of milk spot is expected, further handling of offal by Official s will be requir ed to increase the likelihood of detection of the condition. Information record ed on FCI must be complete and comprehensive to allow the Official to take the appropriate measures. FCI should include information such as history of recent Salmonella in the her d, any disease suffer ed in the herd recently, mortality rate, vacci nation status of the herd , etc. to help the O fficial to define the health status of the herd of origin of the batch sent to slaughter. It might also be important to make the FCI available to the Official with more time than the current 24 hours prior to arr ival of animals to the abattoir. This will allow the arrangement of any specific post-mortem inspection, such as slaughter at the end of the day to avoid cross contamination of carcases wh en slaughtering animals coming from a farm with history of Salmonella . Obstacle 2 : the s election of the post-mortem method has to be made prior to animals arriving at the abattoir based on the risk of each batch. Adaptation 2 : the improvement of the availability of Food Chain Information (FCI) to allow the O fficial s at the slaughterhouse to gathe r enough information with sufficient time to define the risk of each batch , according to the agreed criteria, and to implement the appropriate post-mortem method and arrangements. FSA145003 Final report ANNEX 5 v6 Page 13 of 25 2. Changes to plant layout s and slaughtering procedures During traditional inspection in the study abattoir (which is similar to most abattoirs in the UK): all carcases with any condition s that need trimming and/or other process that need to be rectifi ed (e.g. after MHIs have identified an issue to be addressed before the carcase can be considered as fit for human consumption) are sent to the \"detention \", or \"detained\" . Here plant personnel will take action and then prese nt the carcase to an additional MHI who will confirm that the carcase is fit and stamp it with the health mark . It will then be released to the chillers. These detained rails have a limited capacity. The number of carcases they can take is different in each abattoir; it was around 20 carcases in the study abattoir. Once they are full the main slaughter line has to be stopped to al low time to clear space on the detention rail before a new carcase can be placed on it. How to deal with aesthetic condi tions (such as hair in carcases , bruising, bite wounds, or blood splash) should be included as part of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan for any plant. Different strategies may be used: t rimming in the detection rail detailed above is only one possibility. Plan t operators may favour the rectification of those condi tions on the slaughter line; training expert staff in trimming them without increasing the risk of contamination to other carcases or delaying the speed of the line, or they might manage them during th e further processing of the carcases, such as preparing meat in the adjacent cutting plant. It has been suggested (Anonymous, 2011) that, during the visual post-mortem inspection, carcases suspected visually to be affected with any conditions that may c lassify the carcase as unfit for human consumption should be placed on a \"detention rail\". Here, further inspection (palpation and/or incision) to confirm fitness for human consumption would be carried out. The intention is to place them in the \"detention rail\" and carry out the further inspection without causing any cross contamination to the adjacent carcasses in the slaughter line. These methods might be safe but, in the opinion of the primary author (ROA) not practica l, or feasible, in the modern UK slaughterhouse, as the capacity of current \"detention rails\" will not be sufficient for the amount of potential carcas es that need further inspection. In the authors opinion, those further inspections will have to occur on the slaughter line (right after the visual inspection). Training will need to be put in place to ensure that the risk of cross contamination to other carcases is minimised when these inspections are done. Aesthetic conditions will be no longer inspected b y the O fficial s, as there is no food safety implication. This raises a potential additional problem that may occur with the logistics within abattoirs. Officials will stamp all carcases fit for human consumption and send them to the chillers, but as we hav e explained earlier, plant staff will need to handle them to resolve the aesthetic issues, for example they may need to trim bruising. This could be done before or after the official post-mortem inspection. If it is done after inspection, it is possible that an increase will be required in the capacity of chillers to keep carcases and offal in need of further handling by plant staff . This might affect t he layout of the abattoir. Affected carcases and offal would need to be stored in chillers where practices such as opening hearts, lungs or removing parts of carcases for aesthetic purposes (when no risk for public health has been identified) would take place. These modifications of the layout of the abattoir would need to be part of the plants HACCP plan and the complexity will depend on each particular abattoir. FSA145003 Final report ANNEX 5 v6 Page 14 of 25 The layout of the slaughter line might not permit visual access to the whole carcase for a complete visual -only inspection. This problem was observed in the study abattoir. The back of the carcase is an area particularly difficult to access with a \"hands off\" system. Handling of carcases is not specifically included in the process of traditional inspection but it is necessary to an overall inspection; for example, opening the carcase to achieve better inspection of the inside or turning the carcase around to inspect the back of the carcase. During the trial in the study abattoir, visual -only inspection was located in an area of the slaughter line where this \"turning\" was logistically not possible; the visual -only MHI was unable to achieve an overall inspection, especially of the tail area. This might not be the case for all abattoirs and would not have been the case if the visual -only inspection had occurred at the traditional inspection point in the s tudy abattoir. The use of tools, such as mirrors or turning devices, has been suggested to help the visual access to the whole carcase without handling. Further research would be necessary to study the practicability and usefulness of different tools to im prove the visual -only inspection in abattoirs in UK. The effect of the layout of t he study abattoir might have bias ed the results observed during the trial. The frequency of detection of c onditions identified during the visual -only inspection might have be en higher if the poor access has not impeded the visibility to the whole of the carcase. Obstacle 3 : A potential in creas e in the number of carcases in need of further handling before they are release d to the chillers and the consequent resource implications, whether that be in terms of capital investment and alterations in the layout of abattoirs, or plant staff numbers and training. Adaptat ion 3: Alterations to plant layout and staff resources to handle additional carcass dressing will need to be plant specific. Obstacle 4 : The implementation of mechanisms to ensure that detection of conditions by visual inspection is maximised (e.g. s ome parts of carcases/offal may not be acce ssible to the visual inspection) and the consequent resource implica tions. Adapta tion 4: Additional mechanisms to ensure access and visibility to carcases and offal will need to be plant specific. Risk managers will need to consider if the resource implications are proportionate to the perceived risk and the potential gain. Examples include changes to the layout of the abattoir , or plant staff tasks, such as introduc ing rotating tools or mirrors to allow access to all parts of carcases/offal or the preparation of offal (opening of hearts) prior to inspection. 3. Chang es to plant HACCP and procedu res Historically , meat i nspection has enabled alterations to carca ses th at have little impact on the risk to public health e.g. conditions that affect the aesthetics of the carcases but are n ot considered a risk for humans. If this is no longer part of the duty of the O fficial s from the Competent Authority (FSA in UK), then it will become part of the food business operators (FBO) responsibilities at the abattoir. If visual -only post-mortem inspection were to be implemented at the abattoir, these conditions might no longer be detected and resolved by Officials . In order to deal with these aesthetic issues there would need to be further handling of carcases and offal by the FSA145003 Final report ANNEX 5 v6 Page 15 of 25 operators. These additional procedures will need to be included in the HACCP protocol in each abattoir . There is a potential risk of microbial cross conta mination of carcases and/or offal during these additional handling procedures by the Food Business Operator ( FBO) personnel. This would probably occur after the official inspection (Fig A5:2) and this, must be included as an important control point for the plant HACCP plan. Training on how to handle carcases, detect and rectify the se conditions w ould need to be organise d and delivered by the FBO to their staff. The risk s that arise from potential occupational hazards , which currently apply to Officials , would transfer to the plant personnel staff trained to handle the carca ses and/or offal not rejected at visual -only inspection by Officials . Obstacle 5: The need to transfer additional meat quality responsibilities to the food business operators to deal with all the a esthe tic conditions in carcases (such a s hair contamination) that no longer fall within the Competent Authoritys remit. Obstacle 6 : The potential for microbial cross contamination of carcases and/or offal during the plant procedures to handle and deal with the above aesthetic conditions (after official post-mortem inspection). Adaptatio ns for 5 & 6 : There are no immediate solutions to these obstacles; they will be plant -specific. FBOs will need revise thei r HACCP plan s to address these issues. 4. Changes to data generated in the abattoir Information collected in the abattoirs has a role in the surveillance of animal health and welfare in UK and there is increasing interest in its use and utility . Farmers receive (or, at least, in theory could receive) the Collection and Communication of Inspection Results (CCIR ) for all batches of pigs processed in th e abattoir. This could help the farmers to improve the health status of their h erd by identifying conditions and/or diseases misse d at the farm level but identified during the ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection of the animals. If visual -only inspection is implemented and some condit ions (regarded as low risk for public health, such as certain para sites) are not identified and/or recorded, there is a potential for the loss of information that currently benefit s farmers and national animal health and w elfare status. This includes aesthetic conditions discussed in point 2, such as bruising, bite wound s and blood splash. Where these are considered to be useful welfare indicators additional effort will be required to ensure that they are still recorded. These conditions c ould be identified later on by plant staff (wh en further handling of carcase and offal takes place). To ensure that all post-mortem conditions (regardless of who identified them) are recorded and information is fed back to the appropriate people , CCIR could collect d ata not exclusively from the FSA records but also from the \"further inspection by plant\". These conditions might not be essential for public h ealth but they are still information that should be fed back to farmers/veterinarians as part of the Knowledge Transfer, so they ca n be aware of t he status of their herds . FSA145003 Final report ANNEX 5 v6 Page 16 of 25 Obstacle 7 : a perceived, or actual, l oss of data on animal health and welfare from animals slaughtered in the abattoir . Adaptati on 7: Further work to identify the utility and benefits of the u se of alternative data sources, suc h as the plant s own records of conditions found in th e abattoir (e.g. HACCP records), followed by the implementation of appropriate systems where relevant. 5. Lack of competence, skills and understanding of the new method of post-mortem inspection: visual -only inspection 5.1. Meat Hygiene Inspectors (MHIs) Meat hygiene inspectors might perceive the new system as a potential way to reduce their work loads and subsequently lead to a loss of their jobs. Efforts must be made to e nsure that this is not t he case. The new system will need to be explained; the science behind it and the role of meat inspection should be adequately communicated to MHIs for the alternative method. There will be a need to retrain MHI s for the new visual -only in spection of meat. MHIs have been carrying out traditional inspection for a long period of time and their routine (and habits) may be difficult to modify . Lack of observation during the visual -only inspection due to the reduction of activities and monotony of the new system (Mousing et al. , 1997 ) might lead to a reduction of condit ions detected by MHIs . This could be minimised by reducing the inspection period in the slaughter line for MHIs in the rota. These rotas are individual to each abattoir, and will need to be adjuste d in each one. There is a possible need for better communication between the inspection points for carca ses and offal during the post-mortem inspection . In visual -only inspection the detection of several conditions in different parts of carcase and/or of fal will be required to identify carcases and offal unfit for human c onsumption; for example, enlarge ment of lymph nodes in different parts of the carcase to identify tuberculosis (TB). In the study abattoir there was some information missing as a conseque nce of the layout of visual -only inspection during the trial. MHIs at the carcase inspection point and at the offal inspection point were located in different positions due to spatial limitations and logistics. There was no possible interchange of informat ion, therefore the information was not correlated and the MHIs did not have an overall picture of conditions found in the pig (carcase and offal). If, in the study abattoir, only a visual -only inspection system was in place, then both MHIs would be in the same (or close) location so information about a carcase and from the corresponding offal could be more easily exchanged. This would help to make decisions about the outcome of the post-mortem inspection. To minimise this risk of missing conditions the layout of post-mortem inspection must be adapted to the new method. This must be a nalysed for each abattoir (beca use the design of the slaughter line and inspection points might be different to the study abattoir) to ensure practicality and efficiency. . FSA145003 Final report ANNEX 5 v6 Page 17 of 25 Obstacle 8 : Official inspection team - perception of possible loss of their jobs as a consequence of new system. Obstacle 9 : Reduced awareness due to l ack of experience with the new post -mortem inspection method, insufficient communication between carcase and offal inspection points and/or the potential for a reduction in the attention paid to the task, during post -mortem inspection , due to the monotony of the process . Adaptations for 8 & 9 : It is outwith the scope of Project FS145 003 to suggest methods of change management and how to achieve behavioural change; however, t raining (and subsequent auditing) of all of the Official inspection team involve d with the new system will be needed to ensure an adequate understanding of it and to maintain a high standard of communication and service. 5.2. Official Veterinarian s With traditional inspection, ante-mortem inspection was primarily used to assess if animals that arrived at the abattoir were fit for slaughter; to search for any clinical signs of any disease and to check that there were no welfare issues, either due to transport or arising from the farm of ori gin. If a new or revised risk-based inspection is to be applied, the OV s must be trained in any new requirements that are needed to carry out risk -based categorisation of pig batches, using FCI and previous data (conditions found in previous batches from t he same farm) . This is required to ensure that the decisions , on which inspection should be applied, are made in a standardised, consistent manner. This means that the FCI must be complete and available for assessment at least 24 hours before arrival , but preferable earlier than that . This will allow Officials to ensure that the logistic al issues are addressed and they are ready to undertake the appropriate inspection. The role of FCI and ante-mortem inspection is crucial. Animals sent to the abattoir migh t appear healthy, so FCI from the farm of origin may help to assess the real health status of the farm and detect the hidden presence of some subclinical conditions, which might make the meat from those animals unfit for human consumption, regardless of th e result of ante- mortem inspection at the abattoir. The quality of FCI must be assessed to ensure that the data provided by producers are comprehensive and suitable for the purpose of ante-mortem inspection. There may need to be training for producers on w hat information is needed for FCI. The FCI provided may need to be adapted and/or revised. FCI need s to include further information from the herd of origin, such as recent diseases observed in the herd (Salmonella, Erysipelas...), any conditions observed in the herd (such as lameness), abnormal high mortality, vaccination strategy or any management details that might help Officials to determine the health statu s of the herd of origin. This w ould be necessary to predi ct the likelihood of certain conditions (or take extra precautions to avoid cross contamination, e.g. in case of potential Salmonella presence in pigs sent to slaughter when animal s come from a farm with recent history of Salmonella ) during the post-mortem inspection, such as higher prevalence of pleurisy, Erysipelas -like lesions, or arthritis. FSA145003 Final report ANNEX 5 v6 Page 18 of 25 If the FCI was available to Officials with more time than is current ly required, it would be helpful. The appropriate time period required would need to be investig ated and optimised; it has been suggested that, ideally having it a week prior to the ar rival of the batch, would be of use. Information from the actual batch to be sent to the abattoir might be unknown (as management in the farm might be unsure of the spe cific batch to be sent) but information regarding the herd of origin is known and of gre at importance for the Officials . Information from the FCI and post-mortem data from previous batches received in the same abattoir, collected and kept by the FSA will need to be used for decision -making. FSA could then make any logistical arrange ments in advance ; for example, the availability of additional staff, re-arrangement of slaughter strategies (e.g. pigs coming from farms with a history of Salmonella to be killed at the end of the day or in a specific day of the week) or any other decision to enhance the efficiency of the post-mortem inspection (to maintain the safety of the meat produced in the abattoir) and to minimise the cross -contamination of carcases during the process. This refined approach to ante-mortem inspection may also be important to identify any animal health or welfare problem at the farm, which, with traditional inspection, would have been identified later on during the post-mortem inspection. One of the concerns when changing to visual -only inspection is that diseases such as TB might be missed. If suitable predictive risk factors can be determined through appropriate studies, then animals at a higher risk of being infected , e.g. with TB, might potentially be identified during the ante- mortem inspection of FCI. Obstacle 10 : A perceived, or actual, decrease in the quality of the Official Veterinarian work, such as identification of high risk batches in need of a post-mortem inspection with inclusion of further incision of palpation, due to the lack of experience with the new system. Adaptation 10 : It is outwith the scope of Project FS145 003 to suggest methods of change management and how to achieve behavioural change; however, training (and subs equent auditing) of all FSA personnel involved with the new sys tem will be needed to ensure an adequate understanding of the concepts and responsibilities that are involved and so to maintain a high standard of service . Limitations of trial The recording of the conditions was not exactly the same in the traditional system (touch screen) and visual -only system (spreadsheet) during the first pilot week of the trial , therefore the visual -only spreadsheet was amended to reflect the same conditions as in the tr aditional inspection. During the first week these missin g conditions in the spreadsheet were recorded by M HIs as \"other\" (as requested ) until amended spreadsheets were created and circulated for the following weeks. At the study abattoir, during the tradit ional inspection, conditions we re detected at two points on the slaughter line ( Figure A5:3 & A5:4) and identified using plastic markers attached to the carcase. These conditions were not recorded. In order to speed up processing on the line, an FBO opera tive between the first traditional inspection and final carcase inspection/health marking would remove con ditions such as hair contamination . Carcases found to be free of abnormalities at the second traditional inspection point, including some where condit ions had been rectified (i.e. some hair removal, stripping of pleura, peritoneum) FSA145003 Final report ANNEX 5 v6 Page 19 of 25 went along the main rail for further processing (no further inspection). Any carcass not stamp ed as fit for human consumption at the second inspection point would be sent to the detain rail , where furthe r rectification and trimming could take place. Any carcase rejection conditions were recorded at the end of the detained line . These conditions are, therefore, recorded in the system. There were two points where rectification could have been performed b efore this inspection and recording process. For logistical reasons, d uring the trial at the study abattoir , the visual -only inspection point for the carcases and the recording of the abnormalities seen had to be positioned at the point of the 1st traditional MHI inspection. This was before any rectification or trimming process . There will , therefore, be a higher frequency of recording of certain conditions, such as hair contamination , by visual -only inspection compare d to traditional inspection. I t might seem, that visual -only inspection i s able to detect a greater number of these conditions, but this would be a n incorrect assumption; u sually those conditions were detected, resolved but never recorded.

This operator removed any aesthetic conditions (mainly hair left on the carcases) to improve the presentati on of the carcase. They did not remove any conditions that affect the fitness of the carcases for human consumption, so the final MHI carrying out the traditional inspect ion was presented with all conditions affecting the safety of the meat. The effect of this positioning can be seen in the outcomes from the field trial; for example, in the visual -only inspection many occurrences of \"faeces contaminations in any part except tail\" were recorded. This was due to no visual ac cess to the back of the carcass; whereas in the traditional inspection recording s are mainly of \"faeces contamination in tail\". Any other contamination (apart from tail) ha d been identified by the first M HI (at the visual -only and 1st traditional inspection point) and dress ed by the plant staff before the final M HI at the traditional inspection point; therefore they were not recorded in the system. Contamination in the tail area has not been detec ted by first M HI (and similarly at the visual-only point ) and, as a result it was not address ed before the final M HIs traditional ins pection; hence, it is recorded in the system. We also noticed that there could be another reason as to why there was a higher prevalence of hair recorded on carcases at visual inspection than at the traditional inspection. When conducting traditional inspection, an MHI will usually have a routine e.g. incise the sub maxillary lymph nodes first and then visually work their way up the carcase. It was noticeable that, when conducting the visual inspection, the MHI tended to focus more at eye level. This could possibly lead to more incidences of hair contamination being recorded. In addition, w e noticed duri ng the field trial that there was a difference i n how different MHIs record ce rtain conditions, or more specifically , the location of the conditions. For example, conditions that were locate d in a small part of the carcase could be recorded either under th e specific area (such as bile in belly ) or under a general area (such as bile in trim ). During the sampling and recording of the trial it was observed that it depended on the person. Some of the M HIs were locating these conditions mostly in trim, and o ther M HIs were mor e precise in the location. Both recording systems are fine but may interfere with any comparison of the similarity or difference in the identification of cond itions between visual -only and t raditional inspection method s. This problem was considered during the condition analysis (Objectives 1, 2, and 3) and resolved. Conditions were regrouped accordingly to the type of conditions and not to the location of conditions. Once this was don e, the inspection bias was controll ed. It will be essen tial to train, audit , assess, validate and evaluate the new inspection method when implemented to ensure that it is appli ed consistentl y by all official food safety personnel. During the trial M HIs were not allowed to palpate or incise any carcass during t he process of the inspection. In theory, if visual -only inspection were implemented for outdoors pig carcasses in UK abattoirs, palpation and incision of any part of the carcass will be acceptable whenever the Officials suspect a condition that will need f urther investigation . There were a few occasions during the field trial where the MHIs mentioned the fact that he/she would progress to palpate and/or incise a specific area of the carcass after suspect ing a condition; for example, arthritis of the joints or to differentiate an abscess from a tumour . As explained , no such further inspection took place during the trial . The outcomes FSA145003 Final report ANNEX 5 v6 Page 21 of 25 of the trial may not , therefore, reflect the reality of a visual & risk based system. It is probable that the visual -only syst em as implemented during the field study is a \"worst case scenario\" for the detection and observation of conditions in pig carcasses i.e. the potential of a visual & risk based inspection system to detect conditions in pig carcas es will be greater . However , in the trial, one of the objectives was to compare the microbiological contamination due to handling (palpation and incision) of carcasses during the traditional inspection and during the visual -only inspection, in o rder to investigate whether contaminat ion is lower when visual - only inspection was implemented. The outcomes of this investigation may potentially reflect a better situation than would exist in a visual & risk based inspection system, especially if non-food safety trimming is carried o ut late r by plant staff (ANNEX 3 & 4 ). CONCLUSIONS AND RECO MMENDATIONS Conclusi ons We have identified ten main areas where potential obstacles to the implementation of a risk- based visual inspection system for fattening pigs may occur (Table A5:4). Adaptations should be possible to overcome all of them; however further work may be required. Specific areas include: 1.1. Certain l ack of competence, skills and understanding of the new method of post-mortem inspection (visual -only inspection ) is expected. Training of all FSA personnel for the ne w visual -only inspection is required and should suffice to overcome this obstacle ; to include subsequent audit , evaluation , inter and intra - operator validation and revision of training and methods. 1.2. Use of tools might be needed to help Officials to carry out a whole carcase visual inspection. These tools might be a rotated system or mirrors (so the back of the carcase will be accessible to the visual inspection). 1.3. It is advised (EC, Anon. 2011) that a ll carcase handling and trimmin g by plant staff, such as removal of tumours, should be done in a detained area to avoid any cross contamination to other carca sses: however, the difficulty of such a procedure is understood. It is mainly due to the busy nature and high speed of the slaughter line combined with the number of carcases that are expected to be detained , which is high. I t could lead to delay s and associated costs. This could be partly solved if abattoir personnel are deploy ed in those detain rails permanentl y an d routinely perform these tasks. Alternatively they could be sited on the line near the visual inspection point with adequate training to minimise cross contamination between carcases. 1.4. Animal health and welfare associated information from carcases could be collected with different methods that are already in place in some abattoirs , such as the British Pig Health Scheme ( BPHS ) inspections; or new methods, such as information from further inspectio n done by the plant . The return of this information to producers is relevant for animal health and indirectly relevant for public health as it can be used by farmers to improve the ir herd health status . FSA145003 Final report ANNEX 5 v6 Page 22 of 25 1.5. The result from the microbial study (objectives 1, 2, and 3 of Project FS145003) could be used as the b aseline recommended by the Scientif ic Committee (Anonymous, 2000) for the study abattoir before introducing the new system. Each abattoir will require a baseline t o be established via a microbiological survey of a n appropriate design. 1.6. Revision of current HACCP plans will be needed in abattoirs to ensure that all requirements necessary for the implementation of visual -only inspection are in place and impleme nted to the relevant standards: a uditing of all HACCPs in all abattoirs slaughter ing fattening pigs will be required . Again, these HACCP plans must be individual for each abattoir. The goal of modern meat inspection is to minimise the food -borne risk for humans (Anonymous, 2011 ) (i.e. Food Safety) . It is commonly accepted that it is not possible to reduce the risk to zero; t here will always be certain conditions missed by any method of inspection. The impact of such omissions will be considered in the report for Objective 8. Recommendations A list of recommendations for practices tha t could be included in the abattoirs once the visual -only insp ection is applied is as follows : i. Availability of the FCI in sufficient time to allow risk management decisions to be made and the logistics to be organised, prior to the arrival of pigs for slau ghter, is essential. The FCI might contain information from the whole herd, as specific batch es to be sent to the a battoir might be unknown at the point of information submission . ii. Information in the FCI should include the recent history of the herd . This should include diseases and conditions of interest, such as Salmonella, or Erysipelas , vaccination strategies , and welfare indicators e.g. lameness, tail biting) mortality rate etc. iii. Information of post-mortem inspection from previous batches killed at the same abattoir from the same farm should be available and used by Officials . iv. Officials at the abattoir should use the information from both the FCI and previous post-mortem inspection results from each herd to categorise the batches of pigs prior to arrival at the abattoir according to risk. This will enable the allocation of appropriate resources to improve the quality and efficiency of the post-mortem inspection and maintain the safety of the meat produced. v. Re-arrangement of slaugh tering strategies could include the slaughtering of high risk batches (such as pigs coming from farm with a recent history of Salmonella ) at the end of the day, with a gap between previous batches (to minimise potential cross contamination to low risk batches) or even in a particular day of the week; it may be a pre-requisite that hearts are opened prior to post-mortem inspection in the li ne (e.g. in cases of recent history of high prevalence of endocarditis from batches coming from the same farm); extra plant staff in the line to trim conditions such as pleurisy without disturbing the speed of the line and the work of the FSA inspectors if likelihood of presence of pleurisy is expected to be high . FSA145003 Final report ANNEX 5 v6 Page 23 of 25 vi. Use of any tool available to allow access to the whole carcase (included the back of the carcase) for the visual inspection, such as mirrors, rotating devises or inspectors at both sides of the li ne. Alternatively, allow handling of carcases/offal when necessary, e.g. handling of offal in batches with recent history of high prevalence of milk spot, to improve the detection of milk spot. vii. Communication with the FBO if high risk batches are expected t o be slaughtered at a particular day or time, allowing the abattoir ma nagement team to allocate staff and resources to manage the potential increase of procedures such as preparation of carcases/offal prior to official post-mortem inspection, trimming, detection of carcases or further handling of carcases during the further preparing of the meat before dispatch. viii. Officials should be allow ed minimal handling of carcases if the visual access to the whole carcase/offal is impeded and not resolved with any alternative method. The visual inspection of carcases/offal must be comprehensive and complete to ensure the efficiency of the visual -only inspection. This additional hand ling must be kept to the minimum and only when visual access is not possibl e by any other mean s. ix. MHIs should be authorised to carry out minimal incision of carcases/offal when any condition/pathology is suspect and require the incision for confirmation, such as abscess. The process must be kept to the minimal and hygiene must be ensure d to avoid any cross contamination to other parts of the carcase/offal or adjacent carcases/offal. x. Any of the above should be based on appropriate evidence and agreed a priori by risk managers and the industry to ensure that any mitigation measur es and the consequent resource implications are proportionate to the perceived/apparent risk. Table A5:2 : The ten potential obstacles to implementation of a risk -based visual meat inspection system for fattening pig carcases and adaptations that may be req uired to overcome them. Potential Obstacles Potential A daptations 1. The development of appropriate criteria, on which relevant parties agree, in order to classify the risk status of batches of pigs is a potential obstacle to implementation of a risk-based inspection system Further work is required to develop agreed protocols for the classification of batches of pigs according to the perceived or apparent risk to public health 2. The selection of the post-mortem method has to be made prior to animals arriving to the abattoir based on the risk of each batch The improvement of the availability of Food Chain Information (FCI) to allow the official veterinarian and inspectors to gather enough information with suffic ient time to define the risk of each batch, according to the agreed criteria, and to implement the appropriate post-mortem method and arrangements 3. A potential increase in the number of carcases in need of further handling before they are released to th e chillers and the consequent resource implications, whether that be in terms of capital Alterations to plant layout and staff resources to handle additional carcas s dressing will need to be plant specific. FSA145003 Final report ANNEX 5 v6 Page 24 of 25 Potential Obstacles Potential A daptations investment and alterations in the layout of abattoirs, or plant staff numbers and training. 4. The implementation of mechanisms to ensure that detection of conditions by visual inspection is maximised (e.g. some parts of carcases/offal may not be accessible to the visual inspection) and the consequent r esource implications. Additional mechanisms to ensure access and visibility to carcases and offal will need to be plant specific. Risk managers will need to consider if the resource implications are proportionate to the perceived risk and the potential gai n. Examples include changes to the layout of the abattoir, or plant staff tasks, such as introducing rotating tools or mirrors to allow access to all parts of carcases/offal or the preparation of offal (opening of hearts) prior to inspection 5. The need t o transfer additional meat quality responsibilities to the FBO to deal with all the aesthetic conditions in carcases (such as hair contamination) that no longer fall within the food safety authorities remit There are no immediate solutions to these obstacles; they will be plant -specific. Food business operators will need revise their HACCP plans to address these issues 6. The potential for an increase in microbial contamination of carcases during the plant procedures to handle and deal with the above aesthetic conditions (after official post-mortem inspection). 7. A perceived, or actual, loss of data on animal health and welfare from animals slaughtered in the abattoir Further work to identify the utility and benefits of the use of alternative data sources, such as plant own records of detection found in the abattoir (e.g. HACCP records), followed by the implementation of appropriate systems where relevant. 8. FSA personnel - perception of possible loss of their jobs as a consequence of new system It is outwith the scope of Project FS145 003 to suggest methods of change management and how to achieve behavioural change; however, training (and subsequent auditing) of all FSA personnel involved with the new system will be needed to ensure an adequate understanding of the concepts and responsibilities that are involved and so to maintain a high standard of service. 9. Decre ase of the FSA MHI service quality due to different factors, such as the lack of experience with the new post -mortem inspection method, or the decrease of attention during post -mortem inspection due to the monotony of the task. 10. A perceived, or actual, decrease in the quality of the Official Veterinarian work, such as identification of high risk batches in need of a post-mortem inspection with inclusion of further incision of palpation, due to the lack of experience with the new system.
