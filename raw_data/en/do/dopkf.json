Definition / general - Chronic allergic fungal sinusitis is an eosinophil mediated hypersensitivity reaction initiated by environmental fungi Essential features - Characterized by thick allergic mucin (with degranulated eosinophils and Charcot crystals) and hyphal fragments on GMS stain Terminology - Also called allergic fungal rhinosinusitis Epidemiology - 5 - 10% of all chronic sinusitis Environmental causes - A. fumigatus, A. flavus or demateaceous fungi can trigger extreme eosinophil driven hypersensitivity to fungi in susceptible individuals - Allergic fungal sinusitis is a TH 2-like lymphocyte mediated response Clinical features - Young adult with recurrent sinonasalpolyp, asthma, poor response to medical treatment Laboratory - Peripheral eosinophilia, elevated IgE Radiology description - CT: opacification of the nasal cavity and one or more paranasal sinuses - Erosion of bone (skull base and orbit) is seen in 20 - 60% of cases Case reports - 24 year old woman with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with obstruction of the upper respiratory tracts ( - the mucus and inflamed tissue followed by intranasal or systemic corticosteroids and possible maintenance therapy with fungal desensitization vaccines Gross description - Edematous polypoid respiratory mucosa with thick, tenacious mucus similar to peanut butter or wet clay Microscopic (histologic) description - Diagnostic features: eosinophilic mucin with red and blue ripples (laminations composed debris, epithelium, polymorphonuclear long needle-like structures - Rare noninvasive fungal hyphae (often found only with GMS stain) - Schneiderian mucosa reveals thickened basement membrane with goblet cell hyperplasia, and numerous inflammatory cells with prominent eosinophils - Eosinophils may have degenerative changes of smudged, elongated or basophilic nuclei Microscopic (histologic) images Differential diagnosis - It is unclear if eosinophilic mucin rhinosinusitis (EMRS) is a (AFS) because: - Fungal hyphae are not always detected in allergic mucin, although the sensitivity for fungal detection by the gold standard Gomori methanamine silver (GMS) stain is dramatically improved by trypsin predigestion, which speaks against EMRS as a distinct entity - On the other hand, aspirin sensitivity and bilateral sinus disease are more common types of eosinophilic mucin rhinosinusitis than allergic fungal sinusitis, consistent with the idea that ERMS represents a distinct clinical entity - Thus, this issue remains unresolved "}
