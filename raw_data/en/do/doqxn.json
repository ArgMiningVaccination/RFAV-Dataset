Instrument -Based Ocular Screening Medicaid covers instrument -based ocular screening (99174) (e.g. photo screening, automated - refraction) for children three years to five years of age , who are unable to cooperate with rout ine acuity screening (e.g. intellectual disability, developmental delay and sever e behavioral disorders). Ocular screening is only covered when completed by a physician or a non -physician practitioner. Standard vision screening methods are included in the reimbursement for the age appropriate wellness examination. Screening services generally are not covered by Idaho Medicaid due to statutory requirements for medical necessity. The Affordable Care Act requires certain screening services be required includi ng services with an \"A\" or \"B\" recommendation from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) . The USPSTF gives a \"B\" recommend ation for vision screening of all children at least once at the age of three and once again at the age of four or five to detect the presence of amblyopia or its risk factors. The USPSTF concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of vision screening for children less than three years of age. These services are non -covered.

Tamper Resistant Prescription Requirements To comply with federal regulations, Idaho Medicaid will only pay for outpatient drugs reimbursed on a fee -for-service basis when the prescription for the covered drug is tamper -resistant. If the prescription cannot be faxed, phoned, or electronically sent to the pharmacy, then providers must ensure that the prescription form meets all three of the following requirements: One or more industry -recognized features designed to prevent unauthorized copying of a completed or blank prescription form. One or more industry -recognized features designed to prevent the erasure or modification of information written on the prescription by the prescriber. One or more industry -recognized features designed to prevent the use of counterfeit prescription forms. The intent o f this requirement is to reduce forged and altered prescriptions and to deter drug abuse. Emergency fills for prescriptions written on non -tamper resistant pads are permitted as long as the prescriber provides a verbal, faxed, electronic, or compliant writ ten prescription within 72 hours after the date on which the prescription was filled. In an emergency situation, this allows a pharmacy to telephone a prescriber to obtain a verbal order for a prescription written on a non -compliant prescription pad. The p harmacy must document the call on the face of the written prescription. 4.37.1. References: Tamper Resistant Prescription Requirements (a) CMS Guidance State Medicaid Director Letter# 07 -012.

Idaho Medicaid has adopted the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) periodicity schedule as the recommended frequency for child wellness exams. If a child has not received the recommended care previously, the schedule should be brought up to date at the ea rliest possible time. This periodicity schedule has been replicated in the tables found in Appendix B: Periodicity Schedule . If a PCP determines during a wellness exam or an interperiodic scr een, (see IDAPA 16.03.09.580.01) that a child needs a medically necessary service or product that is not covered under the child's Medicaid benefits, the PCP should consult the Early Periodic Screening and Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit section o f the General Information and Requirements for Providers , Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for coverage and prior authorization information. Federal regulations require that all Medicaid eligible children are tested for lead poisoning at the age of 12 months and 24 months, as part of their wellness exam. Children over the age of 24 months up to 21 years of age should receive a screening blood lead test if there is no record of a previous test. See the Laboratory Blood Lead Screening section for more information. Children younger than 37 months of age with a physical or mental condition that has a high probability of developmental delay are eligible for Early Intervention Services through the Infant Toddler Program. See the Early Intervention Services section of the General Information and Requirements for Providers , Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for more infor mation. Weight management is a covered benefit for children aged five years and older, with a BMI that falls in either the overweight, obese, or the underweight category as calculated using the Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook Physician and Non -Physician Practitioner August 8, 202 3 Page 86 of 167 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Child and Teen BMI Calculator. If a PCP determines a child may benefit from a weight management program and the child, they should review the Preventive Health Assistance (PHA) section of the General Information and Requirements for Providers , Idaho Medicaid Provider Han dbook for more information. Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook Physician and Non -Physician Practitioner August 8, 202 3 Page 87 of 167 4.43.5. Child Wellness Exam: Maternal Postpartum Depression Screening Effective January 1, 2018, maternal postpartum depression screening may be billed for the mother of an infant under 12 months of age if a standardized screening instrument is used. Acceptable screening instruments are: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) ; Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ -9) Screener ; and Beck Depression In ventory (BDI) . Claims should be billed under the infant's Medicaid ID number with G8431 for a positive depression screen or G8510 for a negative depression screen. No additional diagnosis codes should be added for this service. If a screening is positive for depression , mothers with: Active Medicaid coverage should be directed to contact OPTUM Idaho Member Line at (855) 202 -0973 for assistance finding a provider ; Other insurance should be directed to contact their carrier for a list of available providers; or No insurance should be directed to contact community resources in their area . Reimbursement for the screening is limited to three (3) per infant. 4.43.6.

Covered Services and Limitations - Surgery Medicaid pays all surgical fees based on the globa l fee concept as defined by CMS and the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT\u00ae) Manual. The global sur gical package includes all preoperative, intra-operative and postoperative services that are normally a usual and necessary part of the procedure. It also includes all medical and surgical services during the postoperative period to treat complications that do not require a return to the operating room. The following services ar e always included in the global fee payment for the procedure: Access to the site; Local infiltration, metacarpal/metatarsal/digital block, or topical anesthesia ; Subsequent to the decision for surgery, one related Evaluation and Management (E/M) encounte r on the date immediately prior to or on the date of the procedure (including history and physical) ; Supplies, except those identified as exclusions by Medicare ; Miscellaneous services such as: o Dressing changes; o Local incisional care; o Removal of cutaneous sutures, lines, wires, tubes, drains, casts and splints; o Insertion, irrigation and removal of urinary catheters, routine peripheral intravenous lines, and nasogastric and rectal tubes; and o Changes to and removal of tracheostomy tubes. Administration of fluids and drugs during the procedure; Immediate postoperative care, including dictating operative notes and talking with the family and other physicians ; Writing orders ; Evaluating the patient in the post anesthesia recovery area ; Postop erative visits and miscellaneous services related to the surgery including, but not limited to, the application of casts, splints and straps ; and Postoperative pain management provided by the surgeon. If a provider , outside of the performing surgeon's practice, delivers part of the global components listed above, he/she must bill the appropriate CPT\u00ae code for the actual services delivered with the appropriate modifier. Some surgeries may require a prior authorization. Surgeries requiring a prior authoriz ation require an authorization for both the professional component and the facility, but only a single request needs to be submitted for both. Reconstructive and plastic surgery always require a prior authorization. See the Prior Authorization (PA) section for more information on determining if a procedure requires a prior authorization. 5.1.1.

Anesthesiology Anesthesia claims must include th e CPT\u00ae anesthesia code for the surgical procedure that was performed on the participant. Base units will be added by the system automatically and should not be billed separately. Units are equal to Medicare base units multiplied by fifteen (15). A list of Idaho Medicaid base units may be found in Appendix C. Anesthesia Base Units. Base units include p reoperative evaluation, reviewing the participant's medical record, and post -operative visits. Anesthesia time begins when the anesthesiologist physically starts to prepare the participant for the induction of anesthesia in the operating room , or equivalent area, and ends when the anesthesiologist is no longer in personal attendance. Units are equa l to the total amount of time in one (1) minute increments, and any necessary modifiers. Only time spent in personal attendance in the room with the participant should be counted. The anesthesiologist may account for discontinuous time by adding time befor e and after interruptions of personal attendance. Documentation of personal attendance should be maintained as part of the participant's record. Idaho Medicaid limits reimbursement for anesthesia procedures to once per day. The anesthesia start date is th e only date that should be used. Do not date span. A repeat anesthesia procedure on the same day that is billed with the CPT\u00ae modifier 76 or 77 will be considered included in the original payment. Medicaid considers that a second separate session of anesth esia has occurred when a patient is returned to surgery after spending time in another unit of the hospital. In these cases, Medicaid will reimburse both CPT\u00ae anesthesia codes plus the total time for both sessions, with adequate documentation. Medicaid does not pay for supervision of anesthesia services. The provider who administers the anesthesia, either a physician or Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist ( CRNA) , is paid 100 percent of the allowed amount for the procedure. Postoperative pain management is included in the surgeon's global payment when related to the procedure. An anesthesiologist may only render services if they are separate, medically neces sary and the surgeon does not have the skill or experience for treatment. The surgeon is responsible to document in the medical record the referral to the anesthesia practitioner, and why. Anesthesia Modifier s A repeat anesthesia procedure on the same day which is billed with the CPT\u00ae modifier 76 or 77 will be paid at $0.00. AA Anesthesia services personally performed by an anesthesiologist. The AA modifier is used for all basic procedures AD Medical supervision by a physician, more than four concurrent anesthesia procedures. P1 Normal healthy patient. P2 Patient with mild systemic disease P3 Patient with severe systemic disease P4 Patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life P5 Moribund patient who is not expected to survive without the operation. QS Monitored anesthesia care service (can be billed by CRNA or a physician). Modifier QS (Monitored Anesthesia Care) is for informational purposes. Please report actual Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook Physician and Non -Physician Practitioner August 8, 202 3 Page 103 of 167 Anesthesia Modifier s monitoring time on the claim form.

Obstetrical Anesthesia Time for epidural anesthesia services rendered during labor is counted differently from other anesthesia services. Obstetrical neuraxial anesthesia/epidural, CPT 01967 for vaginal delivery is not counted like general anesthesia time. Obstetrical epidu ral time is counted in minutes from beginning to end even if the anesthesiologist is not physically in the room. This is allowed because the anesthesiologist may attend more than one patient concurrently under continuous epidural analgesia for obstetrical deliveries. Medications for pain relief given during the time of the epidural anesthesia are included and must not be billed as a separate procedure. Only one provider will be paid for epidural services. Medicaid does not pay for supervision of anesthesi a services. The provider who administers the anesthesia, either a physician or Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA), is paid 100 percent of the allowed amount for the epidural procedure. Anesthesia for Cesarean Delivery Following a Planned Vagin al Birth Coding for scheduled cesarean deliveries can be done on a single claim line. When a delivery is planned as a vaginal delivery, but concludes as a cesarean delivery, two claim lines are required to fully describe the services. CPT codes 01968 and 01969 are anesthesia add -on codes to be used for cesarean delivery and cesarean hysterectomy following anesthesia given for a planned vaginal delivery. When an appropriately licensed and enrolled rendering/performing provider starts a planned vaginal deliv ery (CPT code 01967) which results in a cesarean delivery (CPT code 01968), both procedures may be billed. The date of delivery must be the date of service for both the primary and add -on code. Do not report CPT 01968 for \"standing -by\" the patient the physician/provider doesn't perform an epidural. Anesthesia for Sterilization at the Time of Delivery Anesthesia time for sterilization is added to the time for the delivery when the two procedures are performed during the sam e operative session. If the sterilization and delivery are performed during different operative sessions, the time is calculated separately. All sterilization consent and documentation requirements must be met. 5.5.5.

Office -Based Pediatric Dental Anesthesia Idaho Medicaid only reimburses dental anesthesiologists for providing moderate to deep sedation or general anesthesia services in the office to participants under the age of 21 when provided in accordance with this section. This service is a benefit under Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT), which requires a prior authorization. The service must be billed with CPT\u00ae 00170 and an EP modifier. Requests for prior authorization must also include the CDT\u00ae for the dental surgical procedure that will be performed for the participant. Conditions Justifying an Approved Prior Authorization Condition Code Set Codes Severe on the table above or below will be handled on a case -by-case basis. Inclusion on the table below does not prohibit coverage of dental anesthesia when a participant has another qualifying condition and procedures for the conditions below are performed in the same session. However, reimbursement for the procedure itself is not covered by this section. Conditions Prior Authorizations will be Denied for Condition Code Set wisdom teeth evidence of pathology, two or more episodes of pericoronitis, or severe pain directly related to the impacted tooth that does not respond to more conservative treatment will be denied. Dental anesthesiologists must perform the following activities based on best practices. Additionally providers must also follow \"Guidelines for Monitoring and Management of Pediatric Patients Before, During, and After Sedation for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures,\" \"American Society of Dentist Anes thesiologists: Parameters of Care,\" \"Practice Guidelines for Moderate Procedural Sedation and Analgesia 2018.\" Prior to the procedure: Review the patient's case with the dentist performing the procedure and the child's parent or guardian; Determine anesthesia is medically necessary and discuss the risks and benefits with the child's parent or guardian; Redirect the dentist to more conservative treatments where possible; Conduct the pre -operative evaluation/assessment prior to the dental p rocedure to determine if the child meets criteria for ASA Class I or II and is therefore appropriate for office -based dental anesthesia; Develop and implement an emergency safety plan including: Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook Physician and Non -Physician Practitioner August 8, 202 3 Page 107 of 167 o Preparation to halt the procedure in case of any complicatio ns; o Details for efficient arrival of emergency personnel and transport to the hospital in case of emergency; o An emergency cart in the room stocked with reversal agents (such as flumazenil and naloxone) and the necessary age and size -appropriate equipment t o resuscitate a child and safely maintain their airway until arrival at a hospital; and o Available support from at least two other persons in the room, at least one of whom is PALS -certified and skilled at obtaining intravenous access. During the procedure : Induce anesthesia and monitor the patient throughout the procedure, including, but not limited to, continuous oximetry, heart rate, and ventilation (ideally by capnography, especially when using deep sedation or general anesthesia); Place vascular access immediately after inducing anesthesia, if unable to place prior to induction; Utilize the lowest dose drug with the highest therapeutic index for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia; and Record full vital signs at a minimum of every ten minutes an d more often during deep sedation or general anesthesia.

Hysterectomies are not covered for the sole purpose of rendering the participant unable to reprod uce. Therefore, they are not considered for coverage under the sterilization policy . A prior authorization (PA) is required by the QIO for coverage . In addition, one of the following circumst ances and supporting documentation must be met for reimbursement : The p articipant was advised both verbally and in writing that the hysterectomy would result in permanent sterility and th e inability to bear children . Providers may either create their own form or use the Sterilization Consent Form (HW0034 or HW0034S). If a provider elects to create their own form, they m ust treat it as any other standalone informed consent form. In addition to the language the provider drafts for the form, it must also contain the language verbatim in the handbook example below, the participant's signature, Medicaid ID number or date of b irth and the date it is signed. The Medicaid ID number and date of birth does not have to be filled in by the participant and can be printed on the form. Either form used must be signed by the participant, regardless of the participant's age or reproductiv e capabilities , and submi tted with claim s for the procedure . The provider may not use a copy of the handbook page in place of a consent form. The participant was sterile before the hysterectomy. The physician must certify this in writing and include the prior cause of sterility. The certification must be attached to claims for the procedure. Medical records are not a substitution for certification. The hysterectomy was necessary for a life -threatening emergency in which prior acknowledgement was not possi ble. The physician must certify this in writing and include a description of the emergency . The certification must be attached to claims for the procedure. Medical records are not a substitution for certification. Medicaid may cover a hysterectomy for a participant found to be retroactively eligible for Medicaid benefits . Prior authorization requests must be submitted to the QIO retroactively. Instructions for retroactive eligibility in the General Billing Instructions , Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook must be also be followed . In the event of retroactive eligibility , one of the three scenarios above must be met for reimbursement , or additionally , if applicable, the physician may submit a written statement certifying that the participant was informed before the hysterectomy that the procedure would make them permanently incapable of reproducing. The certification must be attached to claims for the procedure. Medical records are not a substitution for certification. If using the Sterilization Consent Form, the field for \" operation know n as\" should be completed with \"hysterectomy\" and the form should be signed and dated by the participant. If using a form that meets the required elements below for hysterectomy consent, but not the Sterilization Consent Form, the form may be signed either before or after the surgery has been performed. If the form is signed after the sur gery has been performed, the participant must sign a statement clearly stating that they were informed, both verbally and in writing, before the surgery was performed, that the hysterectomy would render them sterile. Example of Hysterectomy Consent Form Requirements I have been informed orally and in writing that the hysterectomy will render me permanently incapable of reproducing. I was i nformed of these consequences prior to the surgery being performed.

Sterilization Procedures A sterilization is any procedure performed for the purpose of rendering a participant permanently incapable of reproducing. Sterilization coverage includes tubal ligation (by cautery, occlusion, or ligation), salpingectomy and vasectomy as a benefit under Idaho Medicaid for participants 21 years of age and older, who are mentally competent and not institutionalized . Opportunistic salpingectomies , which are effective for sterilization and can prevent future ovarian cancer, are also covered if provided during a cesarean section or hysterectomy. Institutionalized participants are those that are involuntarily confined or detained under a civil or criminal statute in a correctional or rehabilitative facility, such as a mental hospital or other facility for the ca re and treatment of mental illness. Participants voluntarily committed to an inpatient program for mental health services are also considered institutionalized. Hysterectomies are not consid ered sterilizations under this policy. Sterilizations do not require prior authorization from the Department or QIO; however, consent and an interpreter's statement , if applicable , must be obtained with strict adherence to federal regulations including mandatory waiting times . All supporting documentation must use the same name for the participant in all three (3) name fields . Claim s will be denied if consent is not documented correctly. P roviders may not bill the participant for errors related to completing the form. Sterilization claims must include the consent form , court order, if applicable, and an interpreter's statement , if applicable, and the ICD-10-CM code Z30.2 . Procedures , other than hysterectomies, performed for a purpose other than sterilization, but that result in sterilization, instead require attached chart notes and an operative report to the claim . Should the cla im deny for lack of sterilization diagnosis code Z30.2, a claim review request as detailed in the Claim Review Request section of General Billing Instructions , Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook, will be required for successful processing . 5.10.1.

Informed Participant Consent The consent form must be signed by the participant, the person obtaining consent and the physician performing the procedure. An interactive sterilization conse nt form can be downloaded from the Gainwell Technologies Medicaid website. The form is available in English (HW0034) and Spanish (HW0034S). Three copies are needed - one for the patient, one for the physician, and one is required to be attached to the claim. Providers are required to use these forms or other forms , such as HHS -687, that have been approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Pro viders are encouraged to use these forms to prevent any possible discrepancies that may affect reimbursement. Prior to the procedure, the participant must voluntarily sign and date the consent form in the presence of the person obtaining the consent. The participant must be at least 21 years of age, and mentally competent before signing. Mentally competent means the participant has not been declared mentally incompetent by a Federal, State or local court, unless the court has ruled the participant is compe tent to give consent for sterilization. All communications must be provided in a manner the participant can understand including accommodations for participants, who are blind, deaf, handicapped or speak a language other than English as their primary language. Consent does not qualify as informe d if the participant is: In active labor or childbirth; Seeking to obtain or obtaining an abortion; or Under the influence of alcohol or other mind -altering substances. Before the participant signs and dates the consent form, they must be advised that ot her medical care and federal benefits w ill not be withheld based on their decision to be or not be sterilized. The person obtaining consent must offer to answer any of the participant's questions about the procedure and provide a copy of the consent form. The person obtaining consent must also communicate and then certify the following occurred: The requirements on the consent form were verbally explained to the participant ; The participant was advised of alternative options for birth control; The particip ant was informed that sterilization procedures are considered to be irreversible; A thorough explanation to the participant of the procedure being performed including a full description o f the discomforts, risks, benefits and advantages of the procedure; Explain that the procedure cannot be performed except after the mandatory waiting time; and To the best of the person obtaining consent's knowledge and belief, the participant appeared mentally competent and knowingly and voluntarily consented to the sterilization. The person obtaining consent may sign the form any time on or after the date the person giving consent signed the form. If the physician obtains the participant's signature, then the physician must sign both statements on the form, once as the person obtaining the consent and again as the physician performing the surgery. The physician who performs the surgery does not need to be the physician who obtains the consent from the participant. However, the physician who performs the surgery must also sign the consent form. The performing surgeon's signature must be obtained either within three days prior to surgery or any time after the surgery. The performing physician must perform and certify that shortly before the procedure, the physician: Reviewed the consent form with the participant; Reiterated the required components performed by the person obtaining consent; Received a copy of a court order requiring the sterilization, if applicable, and Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook Physician and Non -Physician Practitioner August 8, 202 3 Page 118 of 167 To the best of the physician's knowledge and bel ief, the participant appeared mentally competent and knowingly and voluntarily consented to the sterilization. There must be a lapse of 30 days between the time the participant signs the consent form and the time the sterilization is performed. This allows the participant time to consider the decision to be sterilized. The form expires 180 days after the participan t's signature if the procedure is not performed. Date signed Participant signs form. This does not count as the first day. Day 1 Count begins, and 30 days must lapse. This counts as the first day. Day 3 1 First day surgery can be performed. Day 18 0 Last d ay surgery can be performed. The sterilization may be performed 72 hours after the signature if premature delivery occurs or emergency abdominal surgery is required. In the event of a premature delivery, the informed consent must be signed 30 days or more before the expected due date to qualify as a premature delivery. The surgeon must certify the reason for the exception in paragraph two of the physician's statement of the consent form with either: The expected delivery date and provide written details of the premature delivery; or The emergency nature of the abdominal surgery. If the participant, person obtaining consent or physician fails to complete the statement correctly, all claims regarding the sterilization, including physician, hospital, and anesthesiologist charges, may be denied. Corrections to the participant signature and signature date are not allowed. Corrections are allowed for other fields of the form. 5.10.3.

The participant must meet criteria for clinically severe obesity with a Body Mass Index (BMI) equal to or greater than 40 , or greater than 35 with comorbid conditions such as type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or osteoarthritis of the lower extremities. The serious comorbid medical condition must be documented either by the primary physician who refers the patient for the procedure, or by a physician specializing in the participant's com orbid condition . The physician who refers the participant must not be associated by a clinic or other affiliation with the surgeons who will perform the surgery.

The participant must have a psychiatric evaluation to determine the stability of personality at least 90 days prior to the date a request for PA is submitted to Medicaid. The procedure is prior au thorized by the QIO . If approval is granted, the QIO will issue the authorization number and conduct any necessary length -of-stay reviews. The procedure(s) must be performed in an Idaho Medicaid -enrolled hospital that is also Medicare certified. Physicians and Hospitals practices must meet national medical standards for weight loss surgery. 5.11.1. Abdominoplasty or Panniculectomy Abdominoplasty or panniculectomy is covered only with medical necessity, and a PA from the QIO. Medicaid does not cover procedures for c osmetic purposes.

Inpatient Stay Reviews Idaho Medicaid contracts with a Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) to conduct review on a preadmission basis for selected diagnoses and procedures and a concurrent length of stay review on all hospital stays that exceed a specified number of days. All inpatient admissions must be reviewed by the QIO if the stay exceeds three days, except for a qualifying cesarean delivery (admitting or principal diagnosis) which needs review if the stay exceeds four days. If the patient is not discharged by the end of the third day (count the day of the admission as day one) , a review must be obtained on day f our, and thereafter at intervals determined by the QIO. If the review due date falls on a weekend or a holiday, the review is due by the next business day. The QIO performs retrospective reviews for services that were not reviewed in a timely manner (penalties may apply). Retrospective reviews may also be requested from the QIO for services requiring prior authorization (PA) and for admissions longer than three days when the patient receives retroactive eligibility. The participant's physician or the treating facility may initiate the request for PA. Both providers are equally responsible for obtaining authorization. See procedures and instructions detailed in the QIO Provider Manual or contact the QIO . 6.1. Penalties Medicaid assesses a penalty to physicians and hospitals for failure to obtain a timely QIO review instead of withholding tota l payment. Information on the penalty amounts are detailed in the Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits, IDAPA 16.03.09.505 Physician Services - Provider Reimbursement and IDAPA 16.03.09.705.03 Inpatient Psychiatric Hospital Services - Provider Reimbursement; Physician Penalty Schedule , available online or by calling the Department of Administration, Office of Administrative Rules at 1 (208) 332 -1822. Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook Physician and Non -Physician Practitioner August 8, 202 3 Page 124 of 167 7. Prior Au thorization s A prior authorization (PA) is a written, faxed or electronic approval from the Department or its designee that permits payment or coverage of an item or service that is only covered by such an authorization. Some items and services always require a PA, but others may only require a PA under these circumstances: The participant has exhausted their benefit; The participant does not meet the established criteria, but can demonstrate a medical need; or The participant has an alternative benefit such as EPSDT or waiver that can only be accessed through a prior authorization. Items and services that require a PA mu st receive approval before they can be delivered to the participant except as otherwise noted. It is the provider's responsibility to verify the participant's eligibility on the date of service and to request any required PA. PA requirements specific to a service or item are listed throughout the handbook for the provider's convenience. For information regarding if a prior authorization is required, providers can: Check participant eligibility and PA requirements through your Trading Partner Account at www.idmedicaid.com ; Check the Idaho Medicaid Numerical Fee Schedule available online for items that always require a PA and the authorizing entity; and Check the Appendices of the Hospital , Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook for ICD -10- PCS codes requiring a prior authorization from the Medical Care Unit or the QIO, Telligen . Participants with Medicare as their primary insurance do not require a PA from Idaho Medicaid for Medicare approved items and services. Participants with a different primary payor, or a participant with Medicare receiving services non -covered by Medicare, do require a PA from Idaho Medicaid as if they were Medicaid only participants. A request f or a PA or an approved authorization for services does not guarantee payment. All other Department requirements must be fulfilled. Authorizations only confirm medical necessity criteria for the item or service based on the documentation submitted. The Depa rtment's review of prior authorizations includes general criteria requirements in addition to any item specific criteria. They do not review if a provider or place of service is appropriate or any other considerations. Reimbursement is dependent on the par ticipant being eligible on the date authorized services are rendered and the request must meet any other requirements such as: Meet medical necessity as established in section 011 or 880 of IDAPA 16.03.09, \"Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits\"; Meet all policy re quirements; Be appropriate and effective treatment for the participant's current medical condition; Be furnished by providers with the appropriate credentials; Be the most cost -effective method of meeting the participant's medical needs; and Meet all feder al and state regulations. Medicaid issues a written notification of authorization or denial for all written requests for PA. Participants will receive a mailed notice of decision with information on their appeal rights and how to request a hearing if they disagree with the Department's decision. Providers receive notifications based on their profile's preferences. If the participant or provider disagrees with the Department's decision they can consider requesting a reconsideration or file an appeal . Approved authorizations are valid only for the period between the start and stop dates. If the service is going to be delivered outside of the approved dates, a new PA request must be Idaho Medicaid Provider Handbook Physician and Non -Physician Practitioner August 8, 202 3 Page 125 of 167 submitted. Requests should be made before the expiration of the previous request to avoid breaks in care. When authorized services or items are billed, PA numbers must be included on the appropriate claim line. Effective May 1, 2014, the claim line will be denied if the PA number is not present. Claims for inpatient services must have the prior authorization number on the header or each claim line, or the claim will deny. Some authorizations may also include modifiers as part of the approval. If the modifier listed in the authorization is missing from the claim line it will deny. The PA number and any required modifier are found on the paper Notice of Deci sion (NOD) letter or online through the Trading Partner Account (TPA) under View Authorizations. Payment will be denied for any medical item or service that requires a PA from Idaho Medicaid's designated authorizing entity, but the item or service was pro vided prior to obtaining authorization. An exception may be allowed on a case -by-case basis in which, despite efforts on the part of the provider to submit a timely request or due to events beyond the control of the provider, PA was not obtained; e.g., a h ospital discharge outside of business hours, etc. An explanation of the delay in submission must accompany the PA request and be submitted to the Department with any supporting documentation and a request for an exception. In addition, the provider may not bill the Medicaid participant for services not reimbursed by Medicaid because the PA was not obtained in a timely manner or because the provider failed to verify that a PA was required. If an individual was not eligible for Medicaid at the time items re quiring a PA were provided but was subsequently found eligible pursuant to IDAPA 16.03.05.051.03 , a request must be submitted with all required docum entation within 30 days of the date the provider became aware of the individual's Medicaid eligibility. The medical item or service will be reviewed by the Department retroactively using the same medical necessity guidelines that apply to other prior autho rization requests. If approved, the provider should refund to the participant any amount previously collected for the item or service.

Idaho rule and policy requires payment be made only for claims submitted by the enrolled provider who is physically present ( not simply on -site) and performing the service. Examples of misrepresentation of services prohibited by Idaho Medicaid includes, but is not limited to: 'Incident to' billing of services performed by a non -physician provider of a type or specialty enrolled by Idaho Medicaid under a physician 's NPI; Global billing when services are rendered by two different provider types in the same group practice ; By any provider who is not an en rolled with Idaho Medicaid, under the NPI of any enrolled provider ; Student s or unlicensed aide s of an Idaho Medicaid provider ; Unenrolled subcontractor s to an Idaho Medicaid provider ; and For supervision of services rendered by any other provider of medic al services or supplies, whether or not enrolled with Idaho Medicaid. 9.4.1.

Locum Tenens and Reciprocal Billing Arrangements Idaho Medicaid allows for physicians to bill for locum tenens and reciprocal billing arrangements . Arrangements may be made with one or more substitute physicians, and do not have to be in writing. The absent physician continues to bill and receive payment for the substitute physician's services as though they were performed by the absent physician. Locum tenens and reciprocal billing arrangements are allowed when: The regular physician is unavailable to prov ide the services. The Medicaid participant has arranged or seeks to receive services from their regular physician. The regular physician identifies the services provided by a substitute physician by appending the appropriate modifier to the procedure cod e on claims. The regular physician maintains a record of each service provided by the substitute physician and their National Provider Identifier (NPI). Records must be available to DHW upon request. Services are not reported separately as substitute servi ces for an operation and/or post - operative care covered by a global fee. Locum tenens arrangements occur when the substitute physician covers the regular physician during absences for illness, pregnancy, vacation, or continuing education. The regular physician pays the substitute physician for their services on a per diem, or similar fee -for-time basis . Locum tenens arrangements cannot exceed a period of 90 continuous days. The regular physician must use the Q6 modifier on claims for services provided by the substitute physician in a locum tenens arrangement. Reciprocal billing arrangements occur when the substitute physician covers the regular physician during occasional absences such as on -call coverage. The absent physician agrees to cover the substitute physician at a later time in exchange for their services. Arrangements are not to exceed a period of 14 continuous days. The regular physician must use the Q5 modifier on claims for services provided by the substitute physician in a reciprocal billing arrangement. 9.6.1.
