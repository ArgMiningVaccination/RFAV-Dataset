Quite the contrary, the majority are very much interested in their child's health. They feed them wholesome foods such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains. They don't feed them processed and junk foods, unfortunately a typical diet for many of our children. Ultimately it leads to obesity and health problems. If governments really cared about our children's health they could start by banning heavily processed foods as well as foods high in sugar. As far as vaccinations being scientific, those among that profession also claim genetically modified foods are safe and companies like Monsanto are allowed to operate and compromise the health of one and all. If you do your research and dig deeply you will find out it's all about the money. Susan Harris Bellingen In the mid-1980s our vaccinated children attended a country school. Whooping cough was introduced into the school and almost the entire school of about 150 children were affected. The children woke frequently during the night, coughing so violently that it brought on vomiting. Our children, aged five and 18 months, were affected. Our five year old lost three kilograms. What about the lost hours of learning at the school because the children were so unwell? Our local doctor sighed and said there was nothing to be done, it was a virus, and that it was not called \"the cough of 100 days\" for nothing. There was no public alert and we were not told to keep the children home from school. As promised, after 100 days, it passed and the children recovered, but in the meantime a large number of families in a small town lost three months of sleep. I say this because, fortunately, sleep was all that was lost, unlike the parents whose young babies do not survive the reintroduction of whooping cough into the community in so-called enlightened times. My children were protected because they were vaccinated. These young babies do not and I grieve for their families. Angela Hardcastle Mascot As a practitioner of homeopathy I often find there has not been any attempt to ask parents who have concerns about vaccination why they choose not to, just wild speculation as to their motivations ranging from ignorance to a \"misplaced suspicion in western medicine as a whole\", or \"the result of a casual school gate conversation\". Most parents who have chosen not to vaccinate and the much larger number who have chosen to discontinue the schedule have thought very deeply about this choice before making it. It is not a spurious decision based on a casual conversation. Regardless of whether or not the conclusions they come to may or may not be wrong, to dismiss their concerns so arbitrarily, and make no attempt to understand, nor discuss, let alone address them is a policy bound for failure and further alienation. I know a number of parents who have discontinued the vaccine schedule due to the fact that their child had strong reactions, but when they attempted to get these acknowledged by their GP and registered on the vaccine adverse event register their concerns were either completely dismissed or they were told the symptoms were just a coincidence. Their frustration at their concerns not being taken seriously understandably leads to a lack of trust in official information on vaccine safety. This is not uncommon. They are then told by health authorities that the data on the safety of vaccines is something that they need to trust implicitly. Understandably this leads to a lack of trust in our public health authorities. And if they also question why their newborn should be vaccinated for Hepatitis B they are told the decision is based on cost and convenience. The message: expediency, the wishes of pharmaceutical companies and the health budget are considered a higher priority than the safety of their child. No wonder the rate of not vaccinating has doubled. Kylie Turner Alexandria A call for consistency Oh, those pesky Greens with their stubborn anti-vaccination stance despite the scientific evidence (\"Greens must stop their vacillation on vaccination issue\", April 14). Reminds me of that other pesky lot, you know, the anti-climate-change mob, despite equally powerful scientific evidence. Angela Namoi Crows Nest Wrong to sell souvenirs, sushi at war memorial My grandfather served in both the First World War and the Second World War. My father served in the Second World War. My grandfather was severely wounded while serving at the Western Front. In the Second World War he was one of the lucky ones to survive Singapore. Both men came home from the wars, but both were traumatised for the rest of their lives. I still have the whistle my grandfather used to signal brave young men to their doom. As we come to celebrate 100 years of Anzac,. I think both these men would be broken-hearted by what has become of the Australian War Memorial. The Australian war memorial should be one of the most sacred sights in our land, a place where we reflect on the courage of men,and the horrors of war. It should not be Disneyland. It should not be an entertainment venue or tourist attraction selling cheap souvenirs and sushi rolls. I was greatly saddened to find out this week, that Anzac Hall, as well as other parts of the war memorial are now available for commercial functions: \"a truly unique dining experience where you can wine and dine among historic items\". What have we become? Lest we forget! Radford Lewis Moss Vale Renewable energy is an endangered target Your editorial criticism of the federal government's energy white paper should be extended to the government's intransigence on the renewable energy target (\" [Energy white paper has some huge black holes](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/smh-editorial/energy-white-paper-has-some-huge-black-holes-20150412-1mjflr.html)\", April 13). Minister McFarlane has never explained the reason for the winding back of the target and he looked very uncomfortable announcing the reduction from 41,000 GWh to 26,000 GWh. McFarlane now says the government will not even move from 32,000 GWh to the 33,500 GWh proposed by the opposition. Tony Simons Balmain David Nash (Letters, April 14) failed to mention that Britain proposes to use nuclear power as a major part of its plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Britain is going nuclear as fast as it can. So is China. So is India. So are many oil and gas producing nations of the world, such as the United Arab Emirates. Simeon Glasson (Letters, April 14) failed to mention that nuclear power is prohibited by legislation in Australia. So much for the \"free market\".

What a relief. Now we do not have to threaten our farming land and water supplies. Wonderful. We can wait for all scientific concerns to be addressed. But no! the \"drilling must continue\", the NSW government says. Why? You may well ask. I guess there was a mandate to continue to destroy. Peggy Fisher Killara Bipartisan tax pain, general gain Call me naive if you like, but has there ever been a better moment for the Coalition and Labor to come to a bipartisan agreement on the obvious need for increasing or broadening the GST? In addition to resolving many of our deficit woes, co-operating in this way would mostly nullify the voter backlash that arises when tax increases are discussed. David Harrold Kellyville Greste free to question policy How frustrating it must be for the government. All that work getting Peter Greste released, and a few brief minutes of stunning PR (\" [Peter Greste delivers warning on Q&A: 'If we ignore it, it will come back to bite us'](http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/peter-greste-delivers-warning-on-qa-if-we-ignore-it-it-will-come-back-to-bite-us-20150414-1mkdw2.html),\" April 14). And then the realisation he's anything but the poster boy they imagined. The Peter Greste seen on Q&A must have given certain ministers shivers down their spines. Joan Kunze Penrith All hail Hillary the hungry The gravitas of the headline, \" [Hillary Clinton's hunger for power could unravel her campaign](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/hillary-clintons-hunger-for-power-could-unravel-her-campaign-20150413-1mjqsh.html)\" (smh.com.au, April 14) will be remembered for generations. This was the moment we knew, finally, that a \"power hungry\" candidate could run for President of the United States. Obama, Bush, Clinton, Bush and the men before them through the centuries have overcome their instinctive humility and deference to others to seek high office. Demurring against the trappings of power, the prestige and lure of global authority, no doubt their fierce wives had to work day and night to convince them to announce their candidacy and ruefully step back from their family responsibilities. Well, no longer. Hillary Rodham Clinton is the leader to take us to beyond reluctant candidates, driven only by servant hearts. Alone among her contemporaries with her appetite to lead, Clinton's legacy will clearly be her utterly unique and remarkable drive. This I'll tell my granddaughters: when this woman wanted to lead, against all the odds, she beat a cadre of men who practically begged not to be president.

Mustafa Erem Terrigal Last Post for colonialism There is a lot to admire about Noel Pearson (\" [Pearson calls for competition to recognise first Australians](http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/noel-pearson-calls-for-a-national-competition-to-recognise-indigenous-australians-20150414-1mk45o.html)\", April 14). His suggestion for a national competition to draft a declaration recognising the place of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in the nation's history and culture is a rippa. While we are at it, why don't we declare the date of adoption of this declaration as the new and legitimate Australia Day, thereby moving this fabulous day of celebration away from the unnecessarily provocative Invasion Day. What the heck, maybe while we are on a roll we could remove the Poms' flag from its current inset position on the Aussie flag and replace it with something Indigenous in nature and have our own grown-up flag, free of all colonial artefact? Kevin Jamieson Menai Warring partners in crime At last, bipartisan co-operation between Israelis and Palestinians (\" [Palestinian child labourers reap grim harvest on Israeli-run farms](http://www.smh.com.au/world/palestinian-child-labourers-reap-grim-harvest-on-israelirun-farms-20150413-1mk3zs.html),\" April 14). Too bad that it involves the exploitation of young Palestinians on Israeli farms in disputed territories. Under international law the Israeli settlements in the Jordan Valley are illegal and the use of child labour to harvest their farm produce, facilitated by Palestinian middle-men, is a breach of human rights conventions. Brian O'Donnell Burradoo Learn from the Tate Modern Why aren't we turning the Balmain Power Station, this wonderful building, into an adjunct to the Sydney Art Gallery (Letters, April 14)? One only has to think of the Tate Modern, in London, which is housed in a former power station. Not only would it not mean gobbling up more of the precious Sydney Domain, but it would also give a cultural presence in this part of Sydney. Surely the architectural minds now giving their thought to how to add to the Art Gallery could produce something quite brilliant at Balmain.

Of the front row at the fashion show, 80 per cent are actively involved with their electronic devices and one is doing what 80 per cent of the audience would have been doing 20 years ago: observing and applauding.
