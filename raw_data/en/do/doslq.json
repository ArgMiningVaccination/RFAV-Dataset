C. botulinum causes botulism in cattle, sheep and goats , through 8 either ingestion of the potent neurotoxin C. botulinu m produces , or ingestion of C. 9 botulinum spores which then germinate and colonise the gut cause toxico- infection. 10 Botulism in cattle, sheep and goats is often fatal. Poultry are carriers of C. botulinum ; 11 and the use of poultry litter in processes such as fertilis ing crops used for cattle 12 feeds, has been associated with outbreaks of botulism in sheep and cattle. 13 Foodborne cases of botulism in humans are caused mainly by ingestion of botulinum 14 neurotoxin. Currently animals with botulism (or associated food products such as 15 meat and milk ) are prohibited from entering the food chain until 18 days after the 16 cessation of clinical symptoms , however; asymptomatic animals from the same herd 17 may still be used (ACMSF, 200 9). 18 In 2006 the ACMSF produced a comprehensive report which assess ed the risk to 19 human health posed by botulism in cattle. In 200 9 a further ACMSF report was 20 produced which addressed botulism in sheep and goats. This report reviews the 21 available literature produced since these reports covering the following areas: 22 1. Clostridium botulinum the organism; 23 2. Diagnosis and epidemiology of botulism in animals. 24 3. The link between poultry waste and botulism outbreaks in cattle , sheep and 25 goats. 26 4. Contamination of food products through the transfer of spores, toxins or 27 bacteria from groups of animals with botulism or suspected botulism . 28 5. The associated risk to public health from food products derived from these 29 animals. 30 This information has been collected to assess w hether there is new information 31 which is relevant to the current ACMSF advice on botulism precautions. 32 33 List of acronyms 34 16s rRNA - 16 Svedberg ribosomal ribonucleic acid 35 ACMSF - Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food 36 APHA - Animal and Plant Health Agency 37 ACM/1352 Annex 1 2 BoNT - Botulinum Neuro Toxin 38 DEFRA - Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs 39 DNA - DeoxyriboNucleic Acid 40 EBSCO - Elton B.

In particular, it addresses the link between poultry 62 litter and suspected botulism cases in cattle. The committee assessed the safety of 63 cattle in proximity to poultry litter and the subsequent risk to human health from food 64 chain issues linked to botulism in cattle. The 2006 report concluded that good 65 practice in poultry litter management and disposal should be extended to cattle 66 farmers and the FSA guidance on biosecurity should be extended to highlight the 67 risks of disease transmission through poor management of carcass removal. The 68 report also concluded that the risk to human health presented by toxin types C and D 69 (the main toxin types to affect cattle) is low, and recommended that t he voluntary 70 restrictions on meat and milk from affected animals (for 14 days after the onset of the 71 last clinical case or 17 days after removal of source of contamination ) should be 72 maintained, but indicated that in the absence of other signs, meat and milk products 73 ACM/1352 Annex 1 3 from healthy animals on farms where there have been clinically suspected cas es of 74 botulism do not need to be further restricted. 75 In 2007 the ACMSF sub group met a further three times to discuss botulism in cattle, 76 sheep and goats after the emergence of botulism in sheep. The committee produced 77 a further report on botulism to assess whether the recommendations for cattle made 78 in 2006 should also be applied to sheep and goats, where there have been 79 suspected cases of botulism. The subsequent report published in 2009, concluded 80 that although botulism outbreaks in sheep and goats in the UK are uncommon in 81 comparison to cattle, the number of animals affected by each outbreak could 82 potentially be higher. Poultry litter was also found to be a contributing factor to 83 botulism in sheep and goats. The 200 9 report concluded that there was a strong 84 association between poultry litter and botulism in sheep in the UK between 1999 and 85 2007, highlighting that the advice on the management of poultry litter on farms 86 should be extended to sheep and goat farmers. The risk to human health from 87 consumi ng meat and milk from clinically healthy sheep and goats is negligible, and in 88 the absence of other signs, meat and milk from healthy sheep on farms with 89 suspected botulism should not be restricted. However, clinically affected sheep and 90 goats should follow the same restrictions as those used for cattle. 91 In 2009 , following the recommendations of the 2006 ACMSF report, the FSA 92 amended advice on botulism to follow the recommendation of the committee. The 93 voluntary restriction on meat and milk products from c linically affected cattle was 94 unchanged, but the voluntary restriction on healthy cattle from farms with clinically 95 suspected botulism was no longer necessary , with the recommendation that 96 information should be reviewed if new evidence emerges of cases in cattle , sheep or 97 goats caused by the toxin types A, B, E or F (human toxin types). 98 Clostridium botulinum 99 Clostridium botulinum (C. botulinum ) is an anaerobic, spore- forming bacterium which 100 is responsible for producing a potent family of neurotoxins (ACMSF, 2006 ). C. 101 botulinum can be divided into four distinct taxonomic lineages ( I-IV) with the 102 botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) produced being split into seven antigenically different 103 lineages (A-G) (McLauchlin, Grant, and Little 2006, Rasetti -Escargueil et al. 2020) . 104 The organism is f ound in environments such as soil, rotting vegetation and 105 carcasses (APHA , 2018 ). Spores are resistant to heat, desiccation, some chemi cals 106 and radiation, allowing the survival of the organism for long periods of time ( ACMSF , 107 2006). However, C. botulinum is unable to grow in acidic conditions (pHs of 4.6 or 108 lower ), if spores are present in acidic conditions, they are unable to germinate and 109 grow to produce BoNT (WHO, 2018 ). 110 Botulism in animals is often fatal, cows and sheep may become ill through the 111 ingestion of BoNT or spores in contaminated grass and silage or through contact 112 with poultry litter or carcasses (APHA , 2018) . The majority of animal cases are 113 thought to be intoxication caused by ingestion of the pre- forme d BoNT. However , 114 animals ingest the spores and in some cases it is possible that infection is caused by 115 intestinal colonisation (ACMSF 2006). In animals, clinical signs include sudden onset 116 ataxia, recumbency, and developing paralysis. Clinical signs can develop from 24 117 ACM/1352 Annex 1 4 hours to three weeks after exposure (APHA, 2018). In the UK, botulism in animals is 118 reported under a voluntary restriction , clinically affected animals may not be used for 119 human consumption for 18 days after the cessation of clinical symptoms (ACMSF , 120 2009). 121 Human in toxication by C. botulinum can be foodborne and is potentially fatal. Infant 122 botulism (two months to one year of age) can be caused by both the presence of 123 pre-formed BoNT or C. botulinum bacteria. In infants and individuals with chronic 124 gastro- intestinal conditions such as Crohn's disease, C. botulinum can coloni se the 125 intestine and produce toxin (Fox, Keet, and Strober 2005, Griffin e t al. 1997, 126 Shep pard et al . 2011) . In adults, botulism is more frequently intoxication caused by 127 the ingestion of the pre -formed BoNT ; the C. botulinum bacteria are not usually able 128 to colonise the intestine of adults as the resident intestinal flora outcompete C. 129 botulinum (Roberts 2000, WHO 2018). In adults the onset of illness is between 12 to 130 36 hours after inges tion (McLauchlin, Grant, and Little 2006) with BoNT intoxication 131 resulting in respiratory and muscular paralysis (ACMSF , 2006) . 132 Table 1:Taxonomic lineages of C. botulinum with the strains most commonly affecting each 133 organism , strain H is omitted (Collins and East 1998; McLauchlin, Grant, and Little 2006, 134 Demarchi et al. 1958) . 135 Toxin type A B C D E F G Taxonomic Group I I or II III III II I IV Human Yes Yes Very r arely Very r arely Yes Yes No Cattle Occasionally No Yes Yes No No No Sheep Occasionally No Yes Yes No No No Goats Occasionally No Yes Yes No No No Poultry Yes No Yes Yes No No No 136 Humans are generally affected by lineage I and II C. botulinum which produces toxin 137 types A, B, E and F, with toxin types A and B being the most common foodborne 138 types (Table 1) (McLauchli n, Grant, and Little 2006) . Ruminants are more commonly 139 affected by lineage III C. botulinum which produces toxin types C and D (APHA, 140 2018). The spores produced by all four taxonomic lineages o f C. botulinum are very 141 heat resistant and survive conventi onal pasteurisation conditions (Rasooly and Do 142 2010) . Due to the heat tolerance of spores and fatal nature of the toxins it is 143 essential that the risk to human health from potentially contaminated food products is 144 carefully monitored. 145 146 ACM/1352 Annex 1 5 Reported botulism/suspected botulism incidents 2008- 2018 147 148 Figure 1: Reported botulism/suspected botulism incidents in UK animals and humans between 149 2008 and 2018. 150 The number of UK botulism /suspected botulism incidents in animals reported to the 151 FSA/FSS between 2008 and 2018 are summarised in Figure 1. The number of 152 botulism/suspected botulism incidents in animals since 2008 appear to have 153 decreased. (Figures were prepared using raw data, a start date of 2008 was used as 154 this was the earliest record on the current archive software. Botulism in the UK is not 155 notifiable ). 156 157 Figure 2:Percentage of reported botulism/suspected botulism incidents attributed to each 158 animal species 2008 -2018 . 159 ACM/1352 Annex 1 6 The distribution of cases across different animals is shown in Figure 2, with just over 160 half of reported botulism cases in cattle. Non -specific animal refers to cases w here 161 suspected botulism was reported at a particular farm or location but no animal or 162 case details were given and this accounted for 26%, sheep accounted for 9%, 163 poultry 1% and goats 0% of case s. 164 165 Figure 3 : Percentage of cases attributed to poultry litter as the cause. 166 Of the reported cases, 42% of cattle cases were attributed as being poultry litter 167 related with only 5% of sheep cases linked to poultry litter. 58% of cases related to 168 poultry litter and had no defined animal associated (Figure 3). 169 Objectives 170 The topics for each search were chosen to match the sub sections of the 2006 171 ACMSF report on botulism in cattle and subsequent 2009 ACMSF report. 172 A literature search was performed to obtain data on: 173 Clostridium botulinum the organism 174 Diagnosis and epidemiology of infection in animals 175 Links with poultry waste and botulism outbreaks . 176 C. botulinum infection of food products from cows, sheep or goats through the 177 transfer of spores, toxin, bacteria. 178 Updates on the risk to public health posed by food related botulism. 179 This review specifically c onsiders data related to cows, sheep or goats and was 180 conducted with a global reach. 181 182 Materials and Methods 183 The review was written following the principles of a systematic review methodology 184 (Moher et al. 2009). This involved the following steps: 185 ACM/1352 Annex 1 7 defining review questions and developing the eligibility criteria 186 literature searches 187 screening studies for inclusion or exclusion 188 data collation 189 data presentation 190 interpretation and conclusions 191 192 Review questions 193 The review questions were decided based on the original request from policy and the 194 subsections of the 2006 ACMSF report the original request referred to. This resulted 195 in five separate review questions as detailed below . 196 Review Question One 197 Have there been any peer reviewed publications detailing updates since 2006 / 200 9 198 for C. botulinum and b otulism including: the organism, pathogenesis and disease in 199 humans, botulinum toxin, structure and processing, uptake of toxin, mode of action? 200 Review Question Two 201 Have there been any peer reviewed publications detailing updates since 2006/200 9 202 for epidemiology and diagnosis of botulism including ; occurrence, clinical signs, 203 clinical diagnosis, lab oratory diagnosis, immunology in cows , sheep or goats ? 204 Review Question Three 205 Have there been any peer reviewed publications detailing updates since 2006/200 9 206 concerning the risk to animals associated with p oultry waste ? With particular 207 reference to : the definition of poultry waste, types of litter and manure, or practices 208 and sources of risk to cattle , shee p or goats . 209 Review Question Four 210 Have there been any peer reviewed publications detailing updates since 2006/200 9 211 concerning the risk to public health of products from transfer of botulinum toxin or 212 vegetative spores of C. botulinum to milk and/ or meat from cows, sheep or goats ? 213 Review Question Five 214 Have there been any peer reviewed publications detailing updates since 2006/200 9 215 concerning public health advice/ risk to human health from the biological activity or 216 availability of toxins in humans and milk/ meat products. Toxin availability in meat, 217 human cases associat ed with consumption of foods produced from cows, sheep or 218 goats? From both individuals with suspected botulism or healthy individuals from an 219 affected herd. 220 Literature searches 221 Two databases were searched to retrieve relevant literature.

Inclusion Keyword abstract screening 338 Following title screening, a more specific screen of the abstracts was performed 339 using keywords . In all five searches, any abstracts which did not mention botulism 340 were screened out. 341 ACM/1352 Annex 1 13 Search A was narrowed to screen out all papers that did not refer to C. botulinum , 342 botulism or botulinum toxin and human or animal infection. 343 Search B was refined by excluding results which did not mention C. botulinum or 344 botulism and a relevant animal and a health or diagnosis related term . 345 Search C was refined by including the specific animals : sheep, cows or goats . 346 Search D was refined by excluding searches that did not include either C. botulinum , 347 spores, bacteria or toxin, and the addition of the relevant animals to the inclusion 348 terms. 349 Search E was also refined by the exclusion of abstracts that did not ment ion one of 350 the forms of C. botulinum and one of the relevant animals. Screening strings are 351 detailed in Table 8. Abstracts which met none of the exclusion criteria were taken 352 forward , if the abstract did not refer to any of the exclusion or inclusion criteria the 353 paper was taken to the full text stage and was appropriately screened f or inclusion 354 criteria. 355 Table 8: Screening strategies for abstracts 356 Questions Answers Inclusion/Exclusion Review Question 1 Does the abstract re fer to C. botulinum or botulism ?

This process was performed independently by 360 two FSA researchers in line with good practice guidance for systematic literature 361 reviews. Papers were excluded using the criteria listed in Table 9 based on reviewer 362 interpretation. In the case of disagreements, papers were discussed until a 363 consensus was achieved, with the default of continuing to include the paper in the 364 next stage of the pr ocess. In search B there were a number of papers referring to 365 vaccination of cattle against botulism, this was not part of the 2006 report however, 366 they have been included due to the change in usage since the 2006 report was 367 written . 368 Table 9 : Categories for exclusion from manual sifting 369 Exclusion Category Explanation ACM/1352 Annex 1 15 Botox Concerning the use of botulinum toxi n for clinical and a esthetic purposes such as botox (search A).

The data were extracted and collated using a standardised system 373 independently by two FSA researchers. The methodology and categorisation for 374 information extraction is listed in Table 10. Several papers which were written in a 375 language other than English but had abstracts in English were discovered at this 376 stage. The reviewers were unable to obtain the full texts of these papers in English, 377 so they were excluded at this stage. 378 Table 10 : Method for data extraction and collation 379 Questions Answers Inclusion/Exclusion Is it a primary research paper?

After duplicates were removed, the papers were then 396 automatically screened for relevant keywords in the tit le and abstract using excel 397 formulas for the keywords described in the methods. 398 The abstracts of the papers were then manually sifted for relevance. At this point 399 some of the papers were excluded from each section. Many of the papers excluded 400 at this stage referred to clinical and medical uses of botulinum toxin, or on the 401 chemical hazards of botulinum toxin. For s earch C a number were excluded as they 402 discussed botulism in poultry and wild birds with no reference to transmission to 403 cows, sheep or goats. Searches D and E contained a number of papers for food 404 products that were not derived from cows, sheep or goats. During the full text 405 analysis, a small number of papers were excluded due to the fact they were in a 406 language other than English or that the paper was a review paper. The final number 407 ACM/1352 Annex 1 19 of papers was 40 with 10 in Search A, 23 in Search B, 4 in Search C, 2 in Search D 408 and 1 in Search E. 409 Review Question One- Clostridium botulinum and b otulism. 410 General inform ation 411 Ten primary research papers contained relevant information on updates to C. 412 botulinum or botulism knowledge. There were no relevant publications which 413 contained novel information on C. botulinum the organism , pathogenesis of disease 414 in humans or structure and processing. Five papers contained information on 415 botulinum toxin types, contained information on uptake of toxin and mode of action. 416 Since the 2006 ACMSF report , a further C. botulinum type has been identified. There 417 are eight antigenically different strains of C. botulinum A-H (Prathiviraj, Prisilla, and 418 Chellapandi 2016). Type B C. botulinum produces two BoNT complexes, 16s and 419 12s toxins. The 16s toxin has higher toxicity as it is more stable in stomach acid 420 conditions than the 12s. It was found that this increased toxicity is also due to the 421 16s toxin binding to secretory immunoglobin A which attenuates binding of the toxin 422 to intestinal epithelial cells (Matsumura et al. 2007) . Type B BoNT crosses the 423 epithelial barrier of the human intestine using a hemagglutinin complex to disrupt the 424 paracellular barrier of the intestinal epithelium. It was found that type A BoNT 425 crosses the intest inal barrier in the same way as type B BoNT but is more potent. 426 However, type C BoNT was unable to disrupt the paracellular barrier of human 427 epithelial intestinal cells in culture and therefore had no effect (Fujinaga et al. 2009) . 428 Once intoxicated, it was previously thought that neuronal cells infected with BoNT 429 could not be further infected by BoNT due to disruption of synaptic vesicle recycling. 430 However, it was found that cultured neurons exposed to BoNT type A could still take 431 up BoNT type E (Pellett et al. 2015) . 432 In animals the most common toxin type is from group III. Animals are affected by 433 toxin types C and D as well as a chimeric C/D strain consisting of two thirds C BoNT 434 and one third D BoNT. The heavy chain receptor -binding domain of this mosaic 435 strain was found to bind synaptosome membranes in cattle better than the D strain 436 alone (Zhang et al. 2011) . Group III C-type C. botulinum is able to produce a number 437 of different C -type sub- strains, of which some are virulent and others, avirulent. The 438 difference between the virulent and avirulent strains are single point mutations which 439 induce minor structural changes, these avirulent C sub- strains identified serve as 440 potential candidate strains for further vaccine production (Prathiviraj, Prisilla, and 441 Chellapandi 2016) . 442 One paper discusses the ac quired thermal tolerance of C. botulinum : toxin type A C. 443 botulinum , when exposed to prolonged high temperatures , which is reported to 444 change gene expression away from sporulation, to pathways such as carbohydrate 445 metabolism (Selby et al. 2017). 446 Four paper s contained information on novel detection methods of BoNT which have 447 been further developed since t he 2006 ACMSF report. The first identified a novel 448 method of detection designed to be used as a replacement for the mouse bioassay. 449 As BoNTs block spontaneous neurotransmission, cultured neurons can be used as 450 an in vitro method for detecting neuromuscular junction intoxication (Beske et al. 451 ACM/1352 Annex 1 20 2016) . Three papers discuss the use of qPCR for detection of BoNT genes . Primers 452 or probes are designed to detect the N onToxin NonHaemagglutinin (NTNH) regions 453 of the BoNT genes. Four singleplex assays can be used to identify BoNT genes for 454 the A, B, E, and F toxin types. These could be used to identify BoNT producing 455 clostridia in food samples (Fach et al. 2009) . This was then further developed into 456 multiplex Taqman qPCR reactions to simultaneously detect A, B, E, F BoNT genes 457 from human samples (Satterfield et al. 2010). This method was also used in a 458 second paper which detailed the use of singleplex Taqman qPCR for the detection of 459 neurotoxin- producing clostridia in food samples (Kirchner et al. 2010) . Public Health 460 England diagnostic methods for identifying Clostridium species , then differentiation 461 of species and toxin types u se a selective media- based anaerobic culture method to 462 grow the bacteria combined wi th Gram staining and microscopy for colonial 463 appearance, f ollowed by nucleic acid amplification tests such 16s rRNA sequencing or whole genome sequencing (PHE, 2016). 465 Conclusion 466 Since the 2006 ACM SF report, there are now eight toxin types (A -H) and further 467 characterisation of some toxin types such as the mosaic C/D strain has been carried 468 out. Further mechanisms of intoxication have been identified. The use of NAATS in 469 human animal and food diagnosis methods are now possible, an d in vitro cell culture 470 based methods as a replacement to mouse bioassays are being developed. 471 Review Question Two- epidemiology and diagnosis of botulism in animals. 472 General information 473 After the full text analysis twenty -two papers contained relevant information on the 474 epidemiology and diagnosis of botulism in animals. Of these, all twenty -two referred 475 to cattle, two papers referred to sheep (Payne et al. 2011; Abdel -Moein and Hamza 476 2016) , two papers referred to goats (Abdel -Moein and Hamza 2016; B\u00f6hnel and 477 Gessler 2013) and one paper referred to a human case potentially linked to cattle 478 (Kr\u00fcger et al. 2012) . 479 Of the twenty -two papers, six were from Germany, three were from England and 480 Wales and two were from France, the other papers were distributed across a range 481 of countries as shown in Figure 4. 482 ACM/1352 Annex 1 21 483 484 Figure 4: Geographical distribution of papers identified for question 2 . 485 The number of animal s assessed in each paper varied, the smallest number of cattle 486 used was three and the largest was 1388 cattle. The two papers which included 487 sheep used 52 and 15 sheep, and for goats 51 and 14. T wo papers did not include 488 the number of cattle used. 489 Eight papers contained information of clinical signs of botulism in cattle, three papers 490 were studies on healthy or recovered animals (Souillard et al. 2015; Abdel -Moein 491 and Hamza 2016; Kr\u00fcger et al. 2013). Five contained clinical symptoms described as 492 sudden onset : ataxia, recumbence, muscle weakness or stiffness, difficulty 493 swallowing with a loss of tongue tone and excess salivation, loss of appetite and 494 death (Relun et al. K\u00fcmmel et al. 495 2019; Senturk and Cihan 2007) . These clinical signs support the description of 496 clinical signs in the 2006 A CMSF report. 497 Eighteen papers contained information on laboratory -based diagnosis of botulism 498 (Figure 5). Four papers contained information on clinical diagnosis all as stool 499 samples, (Souillard et al. 2017; Abdel 2016; al. 2012; 500 Seyboldt et al. 2015) , which are cultured on selective media for subsequent 501 diagnostic tests . 502 The 2006 ACMSF report states that laboratory diagnosis is difficult particularly in 503 distinguishing between toxin types. The accepted methods of diagnosis in 2006 were 504 potential indicatory changes in urine of affected cattle and on occasio n visible 505 haemorrhage in the intestines. The most sensitive diagnostic test for C. botulinum 506 toxin is the mouse bioassay method (ACMSF, 2006). 507 Of the eighteen papers identified; seven papers used ELISA as a detection method 508 (Mawhinney et al. 2012; Kr\u00fcger et al. 509 ACM/1352 Annex 1 22 B\u00f6hnel, Wagner, and Gessler 2008). Six papers used qPCR as a detection method 510 (Souillard et al. 2017; et al. 2017, al. 511 Bano et al. 2015; Mariano et al. 2019) . Seven papers used the mouse 512 bioassay (Relun et al. 2017; Guizelini et al. 2019; Gessler 513 2008; Mariano et al. 2019; K\u00fcmmel et al. 2018, Brooks et al. 2010; 2011). 514 Of the papers that used ELISA, 1 paper used ELISA to detect C. botulinum , 5 papers 515 used ELISA to detect the presence of BoNT and 2 papers used ELISA to detect 516 spores (after pre- enrichment). ELISA's were found to be as sensitive as the mouse 517 bioassay for identifying spores, BoNT or C. botulinum , provided that a heat and pre- 518 enrichment step is used prior to the ELISA (Brooks et al. 201 0). qPCR can be used 519 to identify the presence of C. botulinum and differentiate between toxin types using 520 primers o r probes designed to the NTNH regions on BoNT genes as described by 521 Kirchner et al. 2010. Laboratory methods that do not use live animals for diagnostic 522 purposes are preferential and where possible alternative methods are used however, 523 in some instances where diagnosis is difficult the mouse bioassay is still used 524 supplementary to other diagnosis methods . 525 526 Figure 5; distribution of lab -based analysis methods used , for papers where more than one 527 method was used have been counted for each method . 528 APHA diagnosis involves analysis of clinical symptoms and a possible cause such 529 as proximity to poultry litter. If a cause such as proximity to poultry litter is not 530 obvious , a post-mortem of the animal is carried out using visual inspection of organs 531 and intestinal contents are tested tor the presence of BoNT by mouse bioassay and 532 if negative, the presence of C. botu linum - associated toxin genes by PCR . The Agri -food and B iosciences Institute in Northern Ireland, uses ELISA and 534 PCR for diagnosis. 535 ACM/1352 Annex 1 23 Nineteen papers contained information on toxin types ( Table 12), eight referred to 536 toxin type C, nine referred to toxin type D , one referred to the chimeric C/ D type 537 (Souillard et al. 2015) and four papers contained information on other toxin types. 538 539 Table 12: Summary of toxin types contained in literature, some papers refer to more than one 540 toxin type. 541 Toxin Type C D C/D D/C Other (Souillard et al. 2015) (Mawhinney et al. 2012) (Souillard et al. 2015) (Dlabola et al. 2015) (Abdel -Moein and Hamza 2016) (Brooks et al. 2010) (Brooks et al. 2010) (Mariano et al. 2019) (Kr\u00fcger et al. 2012) (Brooks et al. 2011) (Brooks et al. 2011) (Seyboldt et al. 2015) (Kr\u00fcger et al. 2014) (Kr\u00fcger et al. 2014) (B\u00f6hnel, Wagner, and Gessler 2008) (Bano et al. 2015) (Payne et al. 2011) (Fohler et al. 2016) (Guizelini et al. 2019) (Senturk and Cihan 2007) (Senturk and Cihan 2007) (Steinman et al. 2007) (K\u00fcmmel et al. 2018) (K\u00fcmmel et al. 2018) (Mecitolu et al. 2015) (Mecitolu et al. 2015) (Moeller et al. 2009) (Mawhinney et al. 2012) Total 10 10 2 4 542 Four papers described detection of human pathogenic strains of C. botulinum in 543 cows, sheep of goats ( Table 13). Abdel -Moein and Hamza 2016 tested cattle sheep 544 and goats for type A C. botulinum . The results , shown in Table 13, are the 545 ACM/1352 Annex 1 24 percentage of the 18.7% of animals that tested positive for the presence of type A C. 546 botulinum . Kr\u00fcger et al. 2012 tested cows on a farm where there where human 547 cases of botulism . Of the cattle that tested positive 90.9% tested positive for type A 548 C. botulinum , however the human cases had a higher incidence of type E BoNT, 549 suggesting that t he human cases where not from the cattle and originated from a 550 different source. Fohler et al. 2016, tested for the incidence of BoNT genes from 551 faeces of cattle, the results are summarised in Table 13. Whereas B\u00f6hnel and 552 Gessler 2018 tested both cattle and goats for the presence of both human 553 pathogenic strains of C. botulinum or the presence of pre formed B oNT defined as 554 ABE, from a number of different organs in cattle. A fifth paper, Seyboldt et al. 2015 555 tested for the presence of BoNT in cattle faeces, the results showed no detection. 556 These papers demonstrate that on occasion human pathogenic C. botulinum strains 557 can be isolated from animals in Germany , alongside the more prevalent C, D and 558 C/D forms. 559 Table 13: Non C or D toxin types described in the literature with the species these strains were 560 isolated from, the percentage detection rate and method of testing used . 561 Paper Species Toxin Type Percentage detection rate Tested for (Abdel -Moein and Hamza 2016) Cow A 2 C. botulinum Sheep A 5.8 C. botulinum Goat A 2 C. botulinum (Kr\u00fcger et al. 2012) Cow A 90.9* C. botulinum Human E 64.7* C. botulinum (Fohler et al. 2016) Cow A 1.7 BoNT genes B 2.2 BoNT genes E 0.7 BoNT genes F 2.2 BoNT genes (B\u00f6hnel and Gessler 2013) Cow Human (ABE) 4 33 C. botulinum and BoNT Goats Human (ABE) 0 0 C. botulinum and BoNT (Seyboldt et al. 2015) Cow A,B,E,F 0 BoNT *The results for Kruger et al. (2012) refer to a subset of animals. Of the 18.7% tests 562 with positive results, 90.9% of the positive cow related cases were type A and 64.7% 563 of human cases were type E. 564 Three papers contained information on healthy cattle as asymptomatic carriers of C. 565 botulinum . The papers describe that C. botulinum can occasionally be found in the 566 rumen and intestine of non- diseased cows (Fohler et al. 2016) , particularly type C , C. 567 botulinum which can be present without causing illness but induces seroconversion, 568 leading to detectable levels of antibody (Bano et al. 2015) . The third paper foun d that 569 healthy asymptomatic c attle may be intermittent carriers of type C and D C. 570 botulinum , particularly when tested following a botulism outbreak within a herd or 571 neighbouring poultry farm. Healthy cattle tested positive for C/D and D/C C. 572 botulinum . The prevalence of C. botulinum and spores in the environment mean that 573 cattle contamination may occur through indirect contact with contaminated materials 574 including from asymptomatic carriers, however when subsequent testing was carried 575 ACM/1352 Annex 1 25 out two months later no carriage was detected (Souillard et al. 2015) . In accordance 576 with the recommendations of the 200 9 ACMSF report , clinically asymptomatic 577 animals from farms with clinically suspected botulism are not restricted and products 578 may be used for human consum ption. From the papers identified, a symptomatic 579 carriers can be defined as animals that are clinically healthy or asymptomatic but 580 have C. botulinum present in their intestine, rumen or faeces. The faeces of 581 asymptomatic carrier animals may test positive for BoNT, C. botulinum , or spores 582 and blood tests may show increased antibody production against C. botulinum 583 (Abdel -Moein et al. 2016) . 584 Three papers in this search contained information on vaccination against C. 585 botulinum type C and D in cattle. The first, tested both vaccinated and un-vaccinated 586 cows for C. botulinum , types A, B, C, D, E in field conditions, as well as testing 587 faeces for the presence of BoNT. The vaccinated cattle had elevated levels of 588 antibodies against the C and D C. botulinum and a significantly reduced number of 589 spores in their faeces (Kr\u00fcger et al. 2013) . The second paper vaccinated cattle from 590 non-outbreak regions and cattle from outbreak regions that had positive antibodies 591 against BoNT. In both groups the antibodies produced increased against BoNT C 592 after each vaccination. The level of antibody against BoNT D increased after the first 593 vaccination for both groups did not change between the second and third 594 vaccination. There was no difference in the efficiency of the vaccination between the 595 two groups meaning that the natural antibodies did not interfere with the vaccination 596 process (Mecitolu et al. 2015) . The third paper looked at the effectiveness of the 597 vaccination strategy used. Two -week old calves were injected with a priming 598 vaccination of C and D C. botulinum . This was followed by a 4- week booster 599 vaccination. However, samples taken before the 1- year booster was given showed 600 that only 15- 30% of the calves were protected. The paper recommended giving an 601 additional booster at 6 months (Steinman et al. 2007). The 2006 ACMSF report 602 states that vaccination against C. botulinum is only permitted under a s pecial 603 treatment authorisation in the UK. Since 2010, three vaccines are available under 604 special import to the UK which all prevent against botulism caused by C. botulinum C 605 and D toxoids. \"Botulism Vaccine\" (Onderstepoort Biological Products, South Africa), 607 . Ultravac is the vaccine referred to by (Kr\u00fcger et al. 2013) . 608 Conclusion 609 The ACMSF 2006 report on C. botulinum in cattle states that the toxin types most 610 commonly associated with cattle infections are predominantly C and D. Since this 611 report a new chimeric C/D toxin type has been identified and is associated with cattle 612 outbreaks. Since 2006 there have been a smal l number of further instances of cattle 613 outside of the UK testing positive for human pathogenic botulism strains (A, B, E, F ). 614 However no further human cases of C or D botulism have been identified. The most 615 common human pathogenic strain to be identified in cattle and sheep is toxin type A 616 followed by B and F for cattle . These animals were identified in Germany. 617 The 2006 ACMSF report describes the use of a mouse bioassay as the most 618 informative method of C. botulinum detection. Since 2006 there has been a move 619 away from using live animals for diagnostic purposes wherever possible. Testing for 620 ACM/1352 Annex 1 26 the presence of C. botulinum , BoNT or spores may now use pre-enrichment followed 621 by ELISA based methods or qPCR . Mouse bioassay is still used for confirmation, or 622 identification of C.botulinum , BoNT or spores in more difficult diagnoses . Both APHA 623 and PHE use a mixture of laboratory -based methods including NAATS. Un -tested 624 asymptomatic c attle may carry or test positive for the presence of C. botulinum , 625 particularly type C C. botulinum , as type C C. botulinum produces avirulent strains it 626 is possible that some of the strains carried by health animals are a virulent . It is not 627 clear whether suspected clinically affected individuals are tested for the presence of 628 all seven toxin types or just C and D type BoNT. 629 Since the 2006 ACMSF report two vaccinations against C. botulinum are used in the 630 UK, however, available literature is still debating the effici ency of different 631 vaccination regimes. 632 Review Question Three- poultry waste 633 General informati on 634 Four primary research papers contained information on incidents involving botulism 635 outbreaks associated with poultry waste. All f our papers referred to outbreaks 636 involving cattle and two papers referred to outbreaks in sheep. No papers referred to 637 the outbreaks in goats associated with poultry waste. 638 No papers were found for an updated definition of poultry waste, or the type of 639 poultry litter and manure that caused the outbreaks. 640 Two papers detailed botulism in animals caused by proximity to broiler litter ( VLA 641 2011). One paper detailed an outbreak in cattle due to grass silage from pastures 642 alongside where p oultry litter was stored and stacked. The silage was potentially 643 contaminated by type D/C C. botul inum spores which were potentially spread 644 through wind dispersal or run off from nearby poultry litter. The silage was 645 insufficiently acidified, allowing the growth of C. botulinum and production of B oNT 646 However, only the bacteria itself was detected not BoNT. Intestinal samples of one 647 affected cow showed the presence of C. botulinum (Relun et al. 2017) . One paper 648 details positive C. botulinum test results for D/C C. botulinum from cattle in farms 649 within a 1km proximity to asymptomatic poultr y farms (Souillard et al. 2017) . 650 Four papers detailed the source of risk to animals, two detailed the association of 651 poultry litter with type C, D and D/C C. botulinum both cattle and sheep (VLA, 2011; 652 Payne et al. 2011). Two detailed the potential risk of healthy poultry as a potential 653 reservoir of type D and D/C, C. botulinum (Souillard et al. 2017; Relun et al. 2017) . 654 Conclusion 655 Since the 2006 ACMSF report, a number of papers have looked at botulism in 656 poultry and subsequent transmission to cattle. Poultry can be asymptomatic carriers 657 of type C, D and D/C C. botulinum and cattle in proximity to seemingly uninfected 658 poultry farms still pose a risk to cattle health. Disposal of poultry litter in or near fields 659 used for growing crops for cattle or sheep feed poses a risk to the animal's health. 660 The associations between poultry litter and botulism outbreaks support the 661 conclusions of the 2006 ACMSF report advising careful management of poultry litter. 662 However, new studies since 2006 have added additional information to this in that 663 ACM/1352 Annex 1 27 poultry may be asymptomatic carriers of C, D and C/D C. botulinum . Cross 664 contamination may occur through proximity of cattle, sheep and goats or their feed to 665 poultry farms rather than direct contact with poultry waste. 666 Review Question Four - risk to public health of products from transfer of 667 botulinum toxin or vegetative spores of C. botulinum to milk and/ or meat. 668 General information 669 One primary research paper contained information on the risk of transfer of C. 670 botulinum to food products and detailed the toxin types found. 671 The paper details both BoNT and bacteria as present in milk. In this study milk 672 samples from 37 farms affected by botulism in Germany, were tested. Milk from 673 three farms (8.1 per cent) contained BoNT , samples from two farms (5.4 per cent) 674 contained C botulinum . Ten udder samples (19.6 per cent) contained toxin, with 7 675 (13.7 per cent) containing C. botulinum . One sample contained both C. botulinum 676 and BoNT (B\u00f6hnel and Gessler 2013) . 677 The toxin types responsible for human infection described as type A/B/E , identified 678 that both spores and bacteria of this toxin type were present in three of the milk 679 samples (B\u00f6hnel and Gessler 2013) . 680 Conclusion 681 Since the 2006 ACMSF report th ere have been no reported instances of humans 682 becoming ill from ingestion of contaminated meat or dairy products from cows, sheep 683 or goats affected by botulism. However, one further study identified C. botulinum in 684 milk from infected animals. This paper also identified a small number of samples that 685 were type A /B/E human toxin forms of C. botulinum . No further papers were found 686 on the heat tolerance of type C, D or C/D in milk (however, studies on the heat 687 tolerance of type C and D were carried out prior to 2007) . No further information was 688 identified on the transmission of C. botulinum to meat, potentially as clinically 689 suspected animals are prevented from entering the food chain and inspected at 690 slaughter. 691 Review Question Five- public health advice/ risk to human health from the 692 biological activity of toxins in humans and milk/ meat products. 693 General information 694 One primary research paper contained information on public health advice and the 695 risk to human health from botulinum toxins in milk/ meat products. The paper details 696 cows milk as the food product (B\u00f6hnel and Gessler 2013) .The activity of toxins in 697 milk or other food products is not mentioned. The paper found that in a small number 698 of cases the udders of infected cows were colonised with C. botulinum . However, the 699 origin of this infection is not known. It is suggested that the faeces and saliva of both 700 healthy (asymptomatic) and infected cows may contain C. botulinum which may be a 701 source of contamination. The recommended advice is to continue to avoid the use of 702 milk and milk products from infected animals until fully recovered (B\u00f6hnel and 703 Gessler 2013) . 704 ACM/1352 Annex 1 28 Conclusion 705 There was only one paper identified as detailing the risk to human health from food 706 products produced from animals with clinically suspected botuli sm. This paper 707 supports the recommendation of the 2006 ACMSF report which recommend ed that 708 milk and meat from affected animals are voluntarily restricted from entering the food 709 chain for a period of 14 days from the onset of illness of the last clinical case or 17 710 days from removal of the source of contamination. 711 Overall c onclusions 712 Since the 2006 and 2009 ACMSF report s, there are now eight recognised toxin 713 types for C. botulinum , with some C. botulinum strains now further characterised for 714 mechanism of virulence such as the mosaic C/D strain. Commonly used methods of 715 identification of BoNT or clostridia from food, human and animal samples now 716 include ELISA and NAATs to avoid the use of mice where possible however the 717 mouse bioassay remains the most r obust detection method. 718 Since the 2006 and 2009 ACMSF reports; there have been a small number of 719 instances where human pathogenic strains of C. botulinum have been identified from 720 animals outside of the UK . With the most commonly identified human pathogenic 721 strain identified in cattle being toxin type A, followed by B and F, with sheep and goat 722 occurrences of these toxin types being lower than cattle. (Potentially due to the 723 smaller amount of research into botulism in sheep and goats). 724 Healthy c attle may be asymptomatic carriers of C. botulinum , particularly those 725 within close proximity existing outbreaks or poultry farms. Poultry may be 726 asymptomatic carriers of C , D, D/C type C. botulinum and there have been further 727 instances of outbreaks of botulism in cattle and sheep associated with poultry litter , 728 however there have been no outbreaks involving goats in association with poultry 729 litter. 730 There have been few further papers published on the transmission of botulism from 731 animals to food. One paper identified C. botulinum spores in milk identifying human 732 toxin type (A/B/E) spores in milk. Type B spores are more heat resistant than type A 733 spores which could cause an issue if the frequency of animal cases caused by type 734 B C. botulinum were to increase, however the number of animal cases caused by 735 type B C. botulinum are to date is very small (see question 2) . The faeces and saliva 736 of cows may contain C. botulinum spores , which is potentially be a source of 737 contamination if good hygiene practices are not adhered to when milking. There was 738 only one paper detailing the risk to human health from contaminated food (B\u00f6hnel 739 and Gessler 2013) ; this paper supported the safety recommendations of the 2006 740 and 200 9 ACMSF report update where milk and meat from affected animals is 741 voluntarily withdrawn. 742 Uncertainties and future considerations 743 The ACMSF in 2009 recommended that, in the absence of other signs, there should 744 be no requirement to restrict sales of meat or milk from clinically healthy cattle from 745 farms where there have been clinically suspected cases of botulism in cattle. In 746 addition, there is no requirement to restrict the slaughter of healthy cattle from herds 747 where cases of confirmed or suspected botulism have occurred. However, the 748 ACM/1352 Annex 1 29 identified literature described that there have been identified cases of asymptomatic 749 cattle still testing positive for C. botulinum . The strain of C. botulinum most 750 commonly identified from these animals was strain C and a virulent strains of type C 751 C. botulinum have been identified. However, it could not be established from the 752 literature whether the asymptomatic animals were carrying a virulent or a virulent 753 strain. This literature would be useful to establish w hether asymptomatic carrier 754 animals pose a risk to human healt h, particularly in the case of \" raw\" unpasteurised 755 drinking milk . 756 The literature identified that s heep are more susceptible to type A botulism (a human 757 pathogenic strain) than cattle , but the amount of published research on botulism in 758 sheep is considerably less than cattle. The literature review identified gaps in 759 literature around the instances of botulism in sheep, particularly whether C. 760 botulinum can be detected in sheep milk . However, the literature identified that there 761 are fewer instances of botulism in goats particularly type A botulism . No literature 762 was identified that examine d the presence of C. botulinum in goat milk. 763 From the literature identified, it is not clear exactly how C. botulinum spores get into 764 milk. The literature has identified that C. botulinum cannot cross the blood- milk 765 barrier , and that the suckling calves of adults do not also become ill. However, C. 766 botulinum was isolated from udder swabs and milk samples. Further literature was 767 not identified to detail how this contamination occurs, or the precis e frequency of this 768 occurrence. 769 Recommendations 770 The recommendations from both the 2006 and 2009 ACMSF reports have been 771 included below, some of the recommended further work may have been completed 772 or partially completed. 773 Recommendations from the 2006 ACMSF report 774 Epidemiology and diagnosis of botulism in cattle 775 In outbreaks of clinically suspected cases of botulism in cattle we recommend 776 that the mouse bioassay be applied to gastrointestinal samples in order to 777 provide an aid to diagnoses and to help assess risk by determining whether 778 the toxin types involved are those that have been associated with botulism in 779 humans (types A, B & E). 780 Work should be undertaken to understand the diagnostic and clinical 781 significance of finding botulinum toxins in gastrointestinal contents of cattle. 782 Because of concerns over the use of live mice for the bioassay, work should 783 be undertaken to develop new highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tests 784 that do not use animals for the detection of C. botulinum toxins and organisms 785 in biological matrices. 786 Samples collected during clinical investigations should be archived to assist 787 with the development of further assay systems. 788 789 Poultry waste 790 We recognise a need to reinforce DARDNI and VLA/DEFRA messages on the 791 use and disposal of poultry litter (Annexes 4 and 5 in ACMSF 2006) and 792 recommend that the FSA works closely with the poultry industry to ensure 793 ACM/1352 Annex 1 30 good practice in litter management and disposal, while recognising that 794 practical solutions will need to take into account local factors such as 795 availability of arable land or other means of disposal of litter. This advice 796 should be extended to cattle farmers. 797 FSA messages to broiler farmers with respect to biosecurity should be 798 expanded to highlight the risks of disease transmission through deficient 799 practices of carcase removal. Education of cattle farmers with respect to 800 these risks is also recommended . 801 802 Management of botulism outbreaks in cattle in the UK 803 We recommend that UK veterinary authorities continue to encourage cattle 804 farmers to report suspected cases of botulism in cattl e. 805 If evidence emerges of other toxin types such as A, B and E causing 806 outbreaks in UK cattle populations the question of making botulism in cattle 807 notifiable should be reviewed. 808 809 Risk to public health 810 Laboratory evidence suggests that recent outbreaks in cattle in the UK are 811 associated with toxin types C and D. We recommend that the risk should be 812 re-assessed if other toxin types emerge . 813 Clostridial spore numbers are known to increase in milk when cows are fed 814 silage. Spores may be expected to increase if botulism results from toxico- 815 infection (caused by spores) rather than intoxication (caused by preformed 816 toxin). Therefore investigation into the presence of spores in milk from 817 botulinum affected cows should be considered (Driehuis et al, 2000). 818 819 Public Health advice 820 From the evidence presented to the Group, we recommend that, in the 821 absence of other signs, there should be no requirement to restrict sales of 822 milk from clinically healthy cattle from farms where there have been clinically 823 suspected cases of botulism in cattle. 824 Only animals that are healthy should be sent for slaughter for human 825 consumption and therefore any clinically affected animals should not pass 826 ante mortem meat inspection. We recommend that there should be no 827 requirement to restrict the slaughter of healthy cattle from herds where cases 828 of confirmed or suspected botulism have occurred, but that meat and milk 829 from clinically affected animals should not enter the food chain due to concern 830 that this may pose a risk to consumers. 831 It would be worthwhile to undertake a small study on the stability of toxin 832 activity in milk, for native and proteolytically activated toxin types A -E, with 833 and without pasteurisation. 834 835 Recommendations from the 200 9 ACMSF report 836 In the absence of other signs, there should be no requirement to restrict meat 837 or milk from healthy sheep or goats from farms where there have been 838 suspected cases of botulism. 839 ACM/1352 Annex 1 31 The incidence of toxin types other than C and D among sheep and goats 840 should be monitored and the situation s hould be reviewed if there is evidence 841 for the types associated with human disease. 842 UK agriculture departments should reinforce their advice to farmers involved 843 in the production, storage and spreading of poultry litter on measures for the 844 prevention of on- farm botulism and the FSA should work closely with the 845 poultry industry and enforcement bodies to ensure good practice in litter 846 management and disposal, while recognising that practical solutions will need 847 to take into account local factors such as availability of arable land or other 848 means of disposal of litter. This advice should be extended to sheep and goat 849 farmers. 850 UK veterinary authorities should continue to encourage sheep and goat 851 farmers to report suspected cases of botulism 852 853 ACM/1352 Annex 1 32 References 854 Advisory Committee on the Micr obiological Safety of Food, 2006.
