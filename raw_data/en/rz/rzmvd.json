One of the lingering questions that deserved more time and analysis, in my view, was how the United Nations human rights system works and how it could be improved. I was particularly interested in the work of the U.N. 's independent experts on hu-man rights (known in U.N. parlance as the Spe-cial Procedures) who had drawn so much praise and a fair amount of criticism for their activities. This issue had attracted more attention than usual in the context of the negotiations in 2005-06 to abolish the Commission on Human Rights and to create a new and more elevated Human Rights Council. Exasperation bordering on outright hos-tility toward both the Commission and the Coun-cil from the Bush Administration and other gov-ernments only heightened my interest in examin-ing in more depth the tricky intersection between universal norms and practical implementation of such norms at the country level. I was drawn to this issue for several reasons. First, I knew from my own experience and fur - ther research that sound, empirical studies of the role of the Special Procedures and the effective-ness of this mechanism on the ground had never been published. Second, I was convinced that the main challenge to the international human rights community is, as then U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour declared, im-plementation, implementation, implementation. While new human rights norms may need to be developed in some areas, the bulk of the main hu-man rights principles, protocols and procedures have already been conceptualized and codified in treaties that have been signed and ratified by most governments. The real challenge is how the international system created since the end of World War II can be more effective in influenc-ing states to promote and protect human rights for all. Third, given the intensity of the debate around creation of the Council, and knowing that its work would be reviewed after five years (2011), I felt there was an opportunity to contrib-ute something meaningful to the discussion. I am grateful to so many people who helped make this project a reality. Brookings President Strobe Talbott has been a steady and stalwart supporter of the idea of doing more public policy research on questions of human rights, humanitarian af-fairs and foreign policy. He, along with Martin In-dyk, Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy at Brookings, and his predecessor Carlos Pascual, now U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, played an es-sential leadership role in backing this effort. Bruce Jones, who directs the Managing Global Insecu-rity project where I sit, challenged me early on to tackle the effectiveness question. Ongoing support from the Foreign Policy team, especially Char - lotte Baldwin, Julia Cates, Adrienne Anzanello, ACKN oWLEdGEMENTSivCATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human RightsMargaret Humenay, Gail Chalef, Kristina Server and Jacqueline Geis, was essential for keeping the project on track. No intensive research project like this could hap- pen without the vision and financial support of our donors. I am especially grateful to the Em-bassy of the Netherlands in Washington, led by a real human rights leader in the diplomatic com-munity, Ambassador Renee Jones-Bos, and Po-litical Counselor Robert Dresen for their early and enthusiastic endorsement, as well as Maryem van den Heuvel, Edwin Keyzer and Peter Potman in the Hague. The Foreign Ministry of the Swiss Confederation, with the support of Ralf Heckner and Mirko Giulietti, provided timely financial as-sistance, as did the United Nations Foundation Better World Campaign thanks to Susan Myers and Peter Y eo. Support from the Connect U.S. Fund was vital to our convening experts and hu-man rights defenders from around the world for two days of meetings in Washington in February 2010. I especially appreciate the guidance of Eric Schwartz, Nancy Soderberg, Heather Hamilton, and Francesco Femia, along with Karin Ryan of The Carter Center. I was very fortunate in carrying out the project to have the guidance and advice of an outstand-ing Experts Advisory Group of practitioners, academics, lawyers, and activists who helped me work through the conceptual framing, method-ology, and factual details of the report and ulti-mately to endorse its recommendations. I can't thank them enough for their active participation in our meetings and online and always friendly and constructive input. In addition to this group listed on page vii, I benefited greatly from the ex-pertise and feedback of Nigel Rodley, Felice Gaer, Tania Baldwin, Elizabeth Ferris, Julia de Rivero, Philippe Dam, Dokhi Fassihian and Gay McDou-gall. From the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, I want to extend special thanks to Deputy High Commissioner Kyung-wha Kang, Charles as well as Will Davis from the U.N. Information Center in Washington. In order to do an objective evaluation of how gov- ernments respond to the Special Procedures, we had to analyze the public written record, which is voluminous. To make sense of it, I had the in-valuable assistance of my stellar Senior Research Assistant, Emily Alinikoff. On this and so many other details from a to z, Emily made things hap-pen, brought new ideas, created new ways of ana-lyzing and organizing data, organized multiple trips and interviews, and trained and coordinated a fantastic group of top notch graduate and un-dergraduate students. I am especially grateful to Nicholas Marwell, who helped me conceptualize the project, and Christopher Le Mon, who did excellent work on methodology. In addition, I want to thank Pooja Kadakia, Matthew Perault, Mila Cecerina, Bora Park, Anna Fox, and Shannon Dobson for doing the yeoman's work of analyzing scores of reports and communications. Finally, I want to thank my dear wife, Susan Gibbs, and our three wonderful children for en-during my long hours away from home. vCATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human RightsMEMBERS oF EXPERTS W oRKING GR oUP Brookings Research Project on Strengthening U.N.

Over decades, the international community has constructed a house with a strong foundation of universal norms that place the individual's right to human dignity at the center. To give meaning to this concept, states have adopted treaties that define the scope and content of a wide variety of political, civil, economic, social and group rights. They have agreed to regulate and limit the state's power to infringe those rights. And they have forged a variety of tools to monitor how states implement their obligations, and to assist, cajole and demand protection of such rights in real time. Building this house was one of the great accomplishments of the second half of the 20th century. A critical human rights challenge of this century is to ensure that the house functions effectively to shelter those individuals who need protec-tion from discrimination, abuse and violence. To do this, we need to ask and answer a seemingly simple question: What works when it comes to in-ternational promotion and protection of human rights at the national level? This report seeks to answer that question as it relates to one piece of the United Nations human rights system: the in-dependent experts mandated by governments to report on how states respect human rights in fact, otherwise known as the \"Special Procedures. \"The report comes at a time when the main forum states have established to negotiate these ques-tions, the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, continues to face intense scrutiny. For a variety of reasons, most notably the high political sensitiv-ity of human rights, the Human Rights Council has become a battleground for defending a state's reputation at home and abroad. This report does not seek to evaluate all the pros and cons sur - rounding the body as it comes upon its five-year evaluation. It does aim, however, to evaluate an important element of the Council's work in the hopes it will contribute to a more objective and balanced assessment in the United States and around the world of what works when it comes to promoting human rights. FINdINGS After months of research, interviews and field visits, and with the benefit of input from a group of expert advisors, the report draws a compelling portrait of this unique mechanism. Among its conclusions, the report finds: The U.N. 's independent experts on hu- man rights are catalysts for rights, helping to convert abstract principles into mean-ingful change. Thanks to their status as in - dependent experts mandated by the Unit- ed Nations, most Special Procedures have played, and continue to play, a critical role in shaping the content of international ixCATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightshuman rights norms, shedding light on how states comply with such norms, and influencing how governments behave, to the benefit of millions of people. Lack o f state cooperation with Special Pro- cedures represents the chief obstacle to their work. Failure to accept requests to visit, to respond to allegations and to follow up on their recommendations as well as hostile at-tacks on their work are the most glaring and widespread areas needing attention. The Sp ecial Procedures are also hobbled by a host of other challenges, including inad-equate resources and training, insufficient understanding of the local context for their work, and the lack of a systematic process for following up their recommendations. Desp ite these obstacles, the Special Pro- cedures mechanism represents one of the most effective tools of the international human rights system and deserves further strengthening and support from the inter - national community. Coun try visits were seen as the most effec- tive tool for influence in the independent experts' toolbox. The blue U.N. flag they carry on mission when combined with well-prepared and politically skillful judg-ments have a direct impact on elevating at-tention to important and sensitive human rights problems by government officials, nongovernmental organizations, the media and politicians. Coun try visits are especially important for human rights defenders to help them mo-bilize advocacy, involve victims, call atten-tion to problems and remedies, and influ-ence state and international behavior on human rights. Coun try visits have had the effect of influ- encing government behavior in a variety of positive ways: bett er treatment and release of political prisoners and journalists new l aws and policies to protect migrants and internally displaced persons dismis sals and prosecutions of military and police officials charged with abuses moni toring prisons to prevent torture expan ding access to health education and services adopt ing legislation to address domes- tic violence against women and children including victim and witness protection measures, and pro tecting freedom of expression through decriminalizing defamation. The ke y factors that facilitate positive state action in response to a country visit are: The cr edibility and moral power of the United Nations The timin g of the visit at it relates to a country's political development The qu ality and specificity of the expert's research and recommendations The wi llingness and capacity of the gov- ernment to cooperate with the expert The a bility of local NGOs to articulate their grievances in a timely and effective way and to do follow-up advocacy The fr eedom and capacity of the media to report on the visit and track results The ab ility of U.N. staff to support the independent experts through prepara-tion and follow-up activities. Wri tten communications from Special Pro- cedures transmitting allegations of human rights problems to governments have some limited impact on influencing state behav- ior but in general are ineffective.xCATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rights Analysis of nearly 9,000 communications sen t over a five-year period by 17 mandates to 174 states shows that 58% received no or immaterial responses by governments. In 18% of responses, governments took steps to address the underlying allegation in some way, while 21% showed rejection of the allegation with no evidence of an in-vestigation of the underlying claim. On bal ance, states in Europe and the Amer - icas had better scores on responding to al-legations than states in Africa and Asia. Similarly, states considered democratic had a significantly higher positive response rate and a lower rate of non-replies than non-democracies. The imp act of country visits and commu- nications is negatively affected by the lack of any institutionalized mechanism for fol-lowing up on an independent expert's rec-ommendations. RECoMMEN dATIoNS Based on these and related findings, and with the endorsement of the project's Experts Advisory Group, the report makes the following recom-mendations for strengthening the Special Proce-dures mechanism: The se lection process for independent ex- perts, while improved, would benefit from a wider variety of qualified candidates and less political interference from member states. Sta tes should fulfill their obligations to co- operate with Special Procedures by issuing standing invitations, responding quickly to requests for visits, accepting the standard terms of reference for such visits and re-sponding to all communications in a time-ly and substantive manner. A pub lic record of how states cooperate with the independent experts, including a database on all communications, should be produced on an ongoing basis. States should rely on this record of cooperation when electing members to the Human Rights Council and in making decisions on resource allocation and technical assis-tance to states. Spe cial Procedures should improve their working methods by investing more time to preparation of country visits, more bal-anced presentation of their findings, more specific and actionable recommendations, and more careful selection of which states to visit. A numb er of follow-up steps are needed to strengthen the impact of the mechanism such as: regular submission of progress re-ports by states, better coordination among Special Procedures and their staffs, peri-odic follow-up visits, incorporation of rec-ommendations in U.N. country team work plans, and greater monitoring and report-ing by civil society and the media. Giv en the quantity and quality of the Spe- cial Procedures' work in translating uni-versal norms into improved state practice, states and the U.N. system should increase resources for them, continue to reduce ear - marking, and direct funding to support implementation of the experts' recommen-dations. To su pport further professionalization and greater effectiveness, new and improved training of Special Procedures is necessary, particularly training by former mandate holders and development of diplomatic and communication skills.xiCATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rights States must refrain from abusing the Spe- cia l Procedures Code of Conduct to harass independent experts and criticize such be-havior when it does occur. Complaints of inappropriate conduct should be directed to the Special Procedures Coordination Com-mittee which should keep the Council in-formed of steps taken to address allegations. The U.N. sys tem should do much more to integrate the work of the Special Proce-dures into their activities, programs and work plans and find ways to connect their recommendations to funding priorities. 1CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human RightsINTR odUCTI oN In June 2009, a team of researchers at the Brookings Institution's Foreign Policy Program undertook a research project on a cornerstone of the United Nations human rights system: the U.N. Special Procedures. The term \"Special Procedures\" refers to the special rapporteurs, special representatives, independent experts and working groups mandated by the U.N. 's political bodies to monitor and report on human rights violations and to recommend ways to promote and protect human rights. 1 U.N. member states created these mechanisms over thirty years ago to serve as independent eyes and ears evaluating the application of international human rights norms to concrete situations. The Special Procedures carry out this function by undertaking fact-finding missions to countries of concern; issuing communications, including ur - gent appeals, to governments and requesting cor - rective action; calling public attention to specific violations; elaborating on human rights norms; and providing periodic reports to the Human Rights Council (HRC) and General Assembly. They operate as critical nodes in a larger system composed of treaty bodies, political resolutions, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, tech-nical assistance, and field offices, connecting to each part in different and unique ways. They serve as the main entry point into this system for vic-tims and human rights defenders in every corner of the world, offering a practical forum for the promotion and protection of human rights. By most accounts, they have played a critical role in shaping the content of international human rights norms, shedding light on how states comply with such norms, and advancing measures to improve respect for them. They are considered by many to be, in the words of then U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, \"the crown jewel of the system. \" 2 Despite their well-deserved place in the interna-tional human rights architecture, there exists no comprehensive public study of the contribution these key mechanisms have made to implemen-tation of international human rights standards at the national level, leaving a gaping hole in the human rights and foreign policy scholarship that 1 Under criteria established by the Human Rights Council in 2007, these experts are selected based on their expertise, experience in the field of h uman rights, independence, impartiality, personal integrity and objectivity.

Currently there are 31 thematic mandates and 8 country-specific mandates. 2 \"The Special Procedures are the crown jewel of the system.

's hu- man rights system.3 This debate has intensified with the creation of the Human Rights Council in 2006 and continues as member states take up the five-year review of the Council in 2010-11. The purpose of this report is to assess what role the Special Procedures mechanism plays in pro-moting human rights at the national level and to recommend steps for strengthening them. CoNTEXT Over the last several years, U.N. member states and human rights experts have engaged in in-tense and acrimonious debate over the purpose and credibility of the international human rights system. This debate, catalyzed by then U.N. Secre-tary General Kofi Annan's drive for U.N. reform, ultimately led to the establishment in 2006 of a new Human Rights Council to replace the Com-mission on Human Rights. Key features of the old Commission, like the independence of the Special Procedures and of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), were preserved, resources to deploy human rights monitors to the field were expanded, and a new universal peer review mechanism to evaluate each country's human rights record was created. A process encouraging competitive elections for seats on the Council was established, allowing, for the first time, for certain candidates with bad human rights records to be defeated (e.g., Iran, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan and Belarus), although others with similar records continue to be elected (e.g., Cuba, China, Saudi Arabia and Egypt). The Council retained the Commission's ability to ad-dress country-specific situations, and lowered the bar to convene special sessions to examine urgent cases. But some member states, particularly those with worse human rights records, continue to op-pose strongly the principle of country scrutiny while simultaneously supporting certain long-standing exceptions like Israel, which is subject to an open-ended mandate on the Occupied Pal-estinian Territories and often biased treatment. In light of this mixed picture, doubts continue to be expressed in the United States and internation-ally about whether this new arrangement is able to have a meaningful impact on respect for inter - national human rights. One important objective of this study is to put this debate in the United States and abroad on firmer empirical ground by examining the effectiveness of one of the system's most important and prolific mechanisms. It is hoped the results will enable policymakers to make more informed decisions concerning the costs and benefits of policy deci-sions that affect the U.N. 's human rights regime. In this regard, the timing of the report is useful. The U.N. General Assembly, when it created the Council, agreed to review its mandate at the five-year mark in 2011, a process that formally gets 3 A number of other experts have published studies illustrating how the system works and analyzing its working methods.

Furthermore, the Obama Administration faces ongoing challenges about how best to reengage after a period of ab-stention from the Council adopted by the Bush Administration. Disappointments, such as a con-tinued emphasis on resolutions targeting Israel, the lack of attention to other alarming country situations, the election of serious human rights abusers to the Council, and backsliding on free-dom of expression issues have stoked ongoing un-dercurrents of criticism and hostility from some members of Congress, the media, and advocates who have dismissed the U.N. and its instruments as ineffective. METHodo LoGY In evaluating the work of the U.N. Special Proce-dures and their effects on state behavior, the proj-ect focused on state responses to the variety of communications and recommendations issued by the mandate holders. Communications typically convey allegations of an ongoing or imminent hu-man rights violation within the mandate of one or more Special Procedures, and are raised by an al-legation letter or an urgent appeal to the relevant government. In accordance with HRC resolutions, governments are expected to reply to the mandate holder in a timely manner with all information regarding the allegations, including, where appro-priate, the steps the government is taking to ad-dress the alleged human rights violation. 4 To capture how states respond to these com-munications, the project team analyzed official government replies to a set of 19 thematic man-date holders' communications over a five-year period (2004-2008). 5 This part of the research process involved categorizing state replies to thousands of allegations contained in over 5,000 communications sent to over 140 countries. The team assigned one of five values to each state re-sponse, ranging from no reply, on the low end, to steps taken to address the allegation, on the high end. 6 This comprehensive approach allows us to derive conclusions not only about the timeliness and quality of a state's reply, but also about the effect such communications have on influencing state behavior and advancing human rights at the country level. A more detailed note explaining the methodology for categorizing government replies to SP communications is available in the Appendix. The project team also examined country visits, another key tool of the Special Procedures. Dur - ing missions, which are undertaken only with the consent of the state concerned, mandate holders meet with government officials, national human rights institutions, relevant nongovernmental organizations, and alleged victims to assess the situation relating to their respective mandates at the national level. After concluding a visit, man-date holders issue a mission report\u2014including findings and recommendations\u2014to the Human Rights Council. 7 While most states do not for - mally reply to the country mission reports, some do submit notes to the OHCHR or HRC, make public statements or answer follow-up inquiries issued by the Special Procedure. 4 See U.N. HRC Res. 5/2, \"Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the Human Rights Council, \" para. 1. 5 These replies are summarized by OHCHR staff and incorporated into the public reports of the mandate holders to the Human Rights Co uncil. 6 Government responses to Special Procedure communications were assigned one of the following five categories: No Response (NR), Imm aterial Response (IM), Violation Rejected Without Substantiation (VR), Responsive but Incomplete (RI), or Steps Taken to Address Allegations (ST). These categories were slightly altered for assessing the Working Groups due to their different working methods. For more information, see Appendix, Note on Methodology. 7 See U.N. HRC Res. 5/2, \"Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the Human Rights Council, \" Articles 11-13.4CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human RightsThe research team focused on a cross-section of such country visits to conduct qualitative re-search, including field visits to selected countries that a range of Special Procedures have visited. Field visits allowed us to conduct original, quali-tative research by visiting local NGOs, human rights victims, independent experts and govern-ment officials with whom Special Procedures have interacted. The objective of these visits was to as-sess first hand how a variety of states and other stakeholders respond to country visits conducted by Special Procedures and to elucidate findings and recommendations. In November 2009, the project director traveled to Spain and Morocco to study the work of the Special Procedures on torture, migrants, educa-tion, sale of children, housing, and enforced and involuntary disappearances, all of whom con-ducted visits between 2003 and 2009. In January 2010, he visited the United Kingdom to study the work of Special Procedures on migrants, freedom of religion, and the use of mercenaries. In April 2010, he visited Indonesia to study the work of the Special Procedures on education, indepen-dence of judges and lawyers, migrant workers, human rights defenders, and torture. In May 2010, he conducted a research trip to Colom-bia, one of the countries most visited by Special Procedures. Since 2003, there have been a dozen country visits conducted by Special Procedures to Colombia\u2014including the Special Rapporteur on summary executions, the working group on ar - bitrary detention, the Special Rapporteur on in-digenous peoples, and the Special Rapporteur on internally displaced persons (IDPs). 8 In addition to the field visits, the project team initiated oral and written interviews with nearly 30 current and former mandate holders, as well as OHCHR staff, government officials, NGO representatives and independent experts guided by a questionnaire containing over a dozen questions relating to SPs' activities. A list of the more than 230 individuals and groups interviewed can be found in the Ap-pendix. It is important to note at the onset that the proj- ect did not seek to determine the precise causal relationship between the recommendations of Special Procedures and state implementation of international human rights norms. This would be virtually impossible. It would require proving that a state took action on a particular human rights matter as a direct result of an SP's activities. Many factors, of course, contribute to a state's decision to take such action; singling out the specific role of a U.N. mandate holder is unrealistic. That said, the effect or influence of a Special Procedure as a contributing factor or catalyst toward state action is measurable with some confidence. This can be illustrated, for example, through a state's recog-nition of the mandate holder as the catalyst for compliance. Where the project has obtained cred-ible acknowledgement of such causation\u2014and there are a handful of examples\u2014information is reflected accordingly. Typically, though, when governments make progress towards implement-ing an SP's recommendations they do not identify the mandate holder as the source of inspiration or change. In these more typical narratives of government action, the project sought to explain what value-added role the Special Procedures play in implementation and to identify best practices and shortcomings to derive recommendations for further strengthening of the mechanism. We fur - ther aimed to identify the factors that facilitate or 8 From 1992-2004, the official name of the IDP mandate was Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General on Internally Displaced Persons. In 2004, th e official name of the mandate became the Representative of the U.N. Secretary General on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons. In June 2010, the title of the mandate was changed to Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons. The titles are used interchangeably throughout the report.5CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightsundermine the effectiveness of a mandate holder's activities in a particular country. During the course of the 18-month study, the proj- ect convened an experts working group of former mandate holders, human rights leaders, policy-makers, academics, lawyers, and diplomats to ad-vise on the methodology and scope of the project as well as to shape and endorse final conclusions and recommendations. Members of the group are listed on page vii. This group met two times in Washington and engaged in dozens of substan-tive exchanges online. The group provided invalu-able input into the drafting of the final report and reached consensus on its core recommendations; the research findings, on the other hand, are the sole responsibility of the project director. The project director also benefited from participa- tion in various meetings and briefings convened by member states and research institutions regarding the current workings of the Human Rights Coun-cil and its deliberations regarding the five-year re-view. 9 In February 2010, the project and its experts group teamed up with The Carter Center's Human Rights Defenders program to discuss measures to strengthen the U.N. human rights system. The two-day conference held in Washington included private and public meetings aimed at formulating policy recommendations to strengthen the Coun-cil and encourage effective U.S. participation. The chief output of the collaboration was the publica-tion and dissemination of a joint statement, found in the Appendix, endorsed by an exceptional group of human rights defenders, academics, and practitioners about the importance of an effective Human Rights Council. A SHoRT SUMMARY oF SPECIAL PRoCEdURES : WHo THEY ARE ANd WHAT THEY do The U.N. 's system of Special Procedures is a unique and effective mechanism that allows independent, periodic, on-the-ground scrutiny of a country's record of respect for human rights. Since the ap-pointment by the Commission on Human Rights of an Ad Hoc Working Group to inquire into the situation of human rights in Chile in 1975, fol-lowed by appointment of the first special rappor - teur in 1979 on the same subject, this mechanism has grown to become one of the U.N. system's most important instruments for promotion of universal human rights norms at the national and international level. Currently, 31 thematic man-dates exist, an increase of 47.6 percent since 2000; eight country-specific mandates are in operation, a decline of 42.8 percent over the same period. 10 This shift reflects two important trends: the cre-ation of new mandates dealing with economic, social and cultural rights of particular concern to developing countries; and the successful efforts by some states, particularly those with bad human rights records, to avoid the \"naming and shaming\" tactics associated with country-specific mandates in favor of the peer review and technical assis-tance aspects of the Universal Periodic Review. The experts appointed by the Human Rights Council to serve as Special Procedures are in-dependent of governments, serve in their per - sonal capacities, and carry out their mandates on a volunteer basis. They may serve no more than six years total (thematic mandate holders typically serve two terms of three years and coun-try-specific mandate holders typically serve for 9 These included a Wilton Park conference on the HRC five-year review in January 2010, a symposium hosted by New England College of Law in Ma rch 2010, and a research workshop organized by the Centre for International Governance at the University of Leeds in June 2010. 10 A list of current mandate holders can be accessed at <http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/index.htm>. The 2000 OHCHR Ann ual Report refers to 35 mandates, of which 21 were thematic and 14 were country/territory specific.

Their authority is de- rived from their professional qualifications to ad-dress specific human rights situations objectively as well as the political mandate they receive from the Council. Governments rely on them to gather facts, identify problems and make recommenda-tions, but carry out little systematic follow-up.One of their greatest assets is a sense of passion and commitment to the cause of human rights which, combined with subject matter expertise, political skills and good judgment, represents a dynamic force for catalyzing attention and action to protect human rights. In June 2007, the Human Rights Council agreed upon a new system of appointing its independent experts that moves away from the close control formerly exercised by the President of the Coun-cil and the High Commissioner toward greater transparency and consultation with multiple stakeholders. 11 Candidates may be nominated by governments, nongovernmental organizations, other U.N. bodies or individuals. OHCHR pre-pares a public list of eligible candidates. Criteria for appointment include human rights expertise and experience in the field of the mandate, in-dependence, impartiality, personal integrity and objectivity. A Consultative Group composed of representatives from each regional group re-views the candidates and makes recommenda-tions to the President of the Council, who con-tinues a process of consultation before presenting the list to the Council for final approval. While this method has decreased the level of backroom dealing and manipulation that was evident un-der the old system, and continues to generate on whole an impressive and diverse group of candi-dates from every region, some states continue to demand that their favorite candidates be chosen, as was seen most recently in the appointment of certain mandate holders in June 2010. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights serves as the repository of all official com-munications of the Special Procedures and has a specialized unit to support them with a team of professionals who rotate around the system. 12 This support structure has improved from the early days when the Center for Human Rights acted as the U.N. Secretariat's staff for human rights; the Center then became the Office of the High Com-missioner for Human Rights in 1994 with the ap-pointment of the first High Commissioner that year, an important and positive outcome of the Vienna Conference on Human Rights in 1993. The 2003 creation of a Special Procedures Branch (SPB) in OHCHR allowed for better management of resources and personnel. During the following six years, the Special Procedures Branch evolved into the Special Procedures Division (SPD) and continued to support the majority of thematic mandate holders. In 2010, the OHCHR under - went an internal restructuring which resulted in the creation of the Human Rights Council and Special Procedures Division, which is responsible for supporting the Human Rights Council, the Universal Periodic Review, and the Special Pro-cedures. These structural adjustments have further im- proved services to the Special Procedures although much work remains to be done to improve support to the independent experts. OHCHR staff support-ing the country-specific mandates, for example, remain in a separate branch located in a separate building with fewer resources. 13 Furthermore, sup- porting the mandate is only one of many tasks that these country desk officers handle. Some Special 11 HRC Resolution 5/1, paras. 39-53. 12 Despite repeated requests, OHCHR was unable to provide a figure of how many of its staff support the Special Procedures, including the num ber directly assigned to the Special Procedures Branch. 13 OHCHR Annual Report 2009, pp. 18-19, available at <http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/I_OHCHR_Rep_2009_complete_fina l.pdf>.7CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human RightsProcedures bitterly complain of the lack of pro- fessional support they receive from Geneva while others express satisfaction. Tension between the independence of the Special Procedures and the support function of the OHCHR arises fre-quently, particularly around issues of resource al-location, public communications and the Code of Conduct, and demands ongoing attention from the High Commissioner and her senior staff. The main reference points for Special Procedures' examination of a state's human rights record range broadly from the general provisions of the Uni-versal Declaration of Human Rights and other in-ternationally recognized human rights standards to the specific terms of their mandates from the HRC. They may rely on particular instruments of \"hard\" treaty law as well as \"soft\" law of relevant declarations, resolutions and guiding principles. In this regard, they have several important advan-tages over treaty bodies: they are not restricted to the text of any one convention; they may exam-ine any U.N. member state, not just those states that have ratified a treaty; they may make in situ visits to any country in the world (assuming the government concerned grants permission); and they may receive and act upon individual com-plaints without prior exhaustion of domestic rem-edies. This combination of features gives them a uniquely flexible and independent role to play in a system otherwise dominated by governments.They operate, in the words of one researcher, in the space between universal norms and local re-alities, allowing them to elaborate and interpret international standards grounded in concrete sit-uations, \"to define rights in real time. \" 14What role such a mechanism plays in engender - ing state cooperation to defend human rights is the central inquiry of this report. While the U.N. Charter sets forth every state's obligation to pro-mote \"universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or re-ligion, \" and to cooperate with the U.N. to achieve this objective, 15 no specific treaty instrument binds them to cooperate with the Special Proce-dures or to comply with their recommendations. The Human Rights Council has, however, urged \"all states to cooperate with, and assist, the special procedures in the performance of their tasks, and to provide all information in a timely manner, as well as respond to communications ... without undue delay. \" 16 Furthermore, when creating the Council, the General Assembly decided that states elected to the new body \"shall fully cooperate with the Council. \" 17 Nearly all states that run for a seat on the Council make pledges in which they proclaim a commitment to work cooperatively with the Council and its mechanisms, including its independent experts. These provisions offer some leverage for the Special Procedures to insist on state cooperation, who otherwise rely on po-litical pressure and moral persuasion to influence state behavior. As this report details, a variety of factors help to determine state responses to inter - national scrutiny of their human rights perfor - mance. In carrying out their mandates, the Council's in- dependent experts employ a variety of working methods to bridge the distance between interna-tional norms and national-level implementation. 14 Joanna Irene Naples-Mitchell, \"Defining Rights in Real Time: The U.N.

Of these, the country visits and communications are most directly relevant to evaluating the contribu-tion of Special Procedures to national level imple-mentation of international norms and, therefore, serve as the core focus of our report.9CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human RightsSUMMARY oF FIN dINGS 1. Our research found that the U.N. 'sindependent exper ts have played a valuable and, in some cases, decisive role in drawing attention to chronic and emerging human rights issues and in catalyzing improvements in respect for human rights on the ground, including direct support to victims. 2. At th e same time, state cooperation with the Special Procedures is highly uneven and gen-erally disappointing, with some notable ex-ceptions. Cooperation by states ranges from regularly accepting country visits by multiple independent experts along with high response rates to their communications, to virtually zero recognition or dialogue with the rapporteurs. As further illustrated by the evidence that fol-lows, this failure by member states to fulfill their obligations to cooperate with the Special Procedures and address the recommendations they make is the main obstacle hampering their ability to fulfill the mandates states have given them. 3. The Sp ecial Procedures are also hobbled by a host of other challenges, including inadequate training and resources, insufficient under - standing of the local context for their work, and the lack of a systematic process for follow-ing up their recommendations. Despite these obstacles, the Special Procedures mechanism represents one of the most effective tools of the international human rights system and de-serves further strengthening and support. CoUNTRY VISITS Scope of Activity 4. The Sp ecial Procedures are prolific workers, annually conducting dozens of country visits, producing hundreds of country-specific and thematic reports, and issuing thousands of communications to individual governments. Together, Special Procedures have conducted an average of 50 country visits per year since 2005. This number has grown from 48 visits to 38 countries in 2006, to 53 visits to 48 coun-tries in 2008 and 73 visits to 51 states and ter - ritories in 2009. 18 The overwhelming majority of these visits result in country-specific reports presented to the Human Rights Council. In 2009, Special Procedures presented a total of 160 reports to the Human Rights Council and General Assembly\u2014nearly 70 regarding coun-try situations and more than 60 on thematic 18 One explanation for the increase in country visits since 2006 is the creation of three new mandates on slavery, water and cultural rights. The Sp ecial Procedures Facts and Figures from 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 provide annual breakdowns of country visits. For 2005 figures, see the 2005 OHCHR Annual Report.10CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightsissues.19 The total number of reports has re- mained generally consistent over the last sev- eral years; from 2006 through 2008, they pre-sented roughly 150 reports annually. 20 Notably, the number of mandate holders reporting to the General Assembly has increased since 2008 when Special Rapporteurs on Education and Housing were mandated to report annually to the New Y ork body. 21 5. While t he overall number of states visited by Special Procedures annually has increased in the last decade, the breakdown and make up of those states and mandates in a given year have varied. States in the GRULAC and Af-rica groups stand out as demonstrating an in-creased willingness to receive visits compared to other regions. In 1999 GRULAC and Africa hosted thirteen and nine visits respectively. In 2009 they hosted 23 and 19 each. States in the Asia, WEOG, and EEG groups received a slightly higher number of visits in 2009 as they did in 1999. 22 For a country-by-country sum- mary of the number of completed and pending SP visits, see the Appendix. 6. The st ates that have received the highest number of visits\u201416 states and territories have received ten or more visits in the last ten years\u2014have received an increasingly diverse group of the-matic mandate holders, reflecting the intro-duction of new areas of attention, especially topics concerned with economic, social and cultural rights and group rights. 23 For example, Guatemala\u2014one of the most frequently visited states\u2014has received the Special Procedures on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary execu-tion; involuntary disappearances; and in more recent years the mandate holders on food and 19 Facts and Figures 2009, p. 14, available at <http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/docs/Facts_Figures2009.pdf>. 20 Facts and Figures 2007, p. 16, available at <http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/docs/SP2007FactsFigures.pdf>; Facts and Figures 2007, p . 10, available at <http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/docs/SP2007FactsFigures.pdf>; Facts and Figures 2008, p. 12, available at <http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/docs/Facts_Figures2008.pdf>. 21 A total of 22 thematic and three country specific mandate holders currently submit annual reports to the GA. Facts and Figures 2009, pp. 4 an d 14, available at <http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/docs/Facts_Figures2009.pdf>. 22 The Asia Group received 11 visits in 1999 and 13 in 2009; WEOG received 7 visits in 1999 and 9 in 2009; EEG received 7 in 1999 and 8 in 2009. 23 The 16 states and territories that have received more than ten visits since 1998 are Sudan, Cambodia, Colombia, Guatemala, Occupied Pa lestinian Territories, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Brazil, Mexico, Afghanistan, Burundi, the United States of America, Turkey, Ecuador, United Kingdom and Indonesia. 11CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightseducation. Among its visits, the Russian Federa- tion has accepted the Special Procedures on vi-olence against women, independence of judges and lawyers, and indigenous rights (although it continues to deny permission for the expert on torture to visit). Brazil has hosted several man-date holders, running the gamut from torture and housing to toxic waste, while the United States has received the Special Procedures on migrants, extreme poverty, counter terrorism, and the use of mercenaries, among others. 24 7. In so me cases, states have received more than one visit from the same thematic mandate over the last ten years. For instance, Nigeria received the Special Rapporteur on food in 2001 and for a follow up in 2004; the Democratic Republic of Congo hosted the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary execu-tions in 2002 and 2009; the Special Rapporteur on education visited the United Kingdom in 1999 and 2002; and the Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG) on internally displaced persons visited Georgia three times from 2000 to 2008. Twenty-four states have received repeat visits from the same mandate. Colombia and Guatemala top this list, having received five and three repeat visits respective-ly. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Cuba, Ecuador, Timor-Leste and Uganda have each received two repeat visits. 25 OHCHR main- tains a list of country visits conducted since 1998 with tallies of forthcoming, requested, and pending visit requests. Please see the Ap-pendix for a summary breakdown. 8. By mos t accounts, country visits were the most important tool in the SP toolbox. The monitoring function of a Special Procedures' country visit in and of itself has a salutary im-pact on the human rights situation in a given country. This is largely due to the serious at-tention SP visits receive from most govern-ments, civil society and the media. The blue U.N. flag SPs carry when they land in a coun-try allows them privileged access to key ac-tors on the ground, granting them an elevated voice in the quest to achieve greater respect for human rights. Their physical presence in country gives victims of human rights viola-tions and their defenders a higher platform for advocacy at the national level and a direct entry point into an otherwise complicated and bureaucratic U.N. system. 9. Coun try visits by SPs, which typically last 5-15 days, allow for close examination of specific human rights situations and motivate key ac-tors in and outside governments to concen-trate their energies toward establishing facts, identifying violations and recommending remedies. The visits are especially important for civil society actors who devote consider - able time and attention to informing the ex-perts about the human rights problems in the country, preparing substantive reports, helping them make contact with victims and suggest-ing ways to improve state compliance with in-ternational standards. In many cases, such vis-its prompt or strengthen mechanisms of col-laboration among disparate nongovernmental 24 The United States has hosted 14 country visits since 1998. In 2005, it rejected visit requests from the Special Procedures on health and on indep endence of judges and lawyers to visit Guantanamo Bay while accepting the same request of the Special Procedures on freedom of religion, torture, and arbitrary detention. The terms of the visit, however, were very limited, allowing only one day and prohibiting private interviews with detainees. The SPs declined the visit on grounds that restricting the privacy of confidential interviews contravenes the Terms of Reference for Fact-finding Missions by Special Procedures. To view the SPs' press release, see <http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=608&LangID=E>. 25 The 16 states that have received one repeat visit from the same mandate are: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cen tral African Republic, Chile, El Salvador, Georgia, Germany, Netherlands, Niger, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Turkey, Y emen, and the United States. For a list of states visited, see <http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/countryvisitsa-e.htm#burundi>. A list is also contained in the Appendix.12CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightsorganizations, help professionalize their work and foster ongoing cooperation that leads to more effective advocacy. The visits also allow mandate holders the opportunity to raise issues directly with government officials at the high-est levels and advise them on specific reforms. 10. Bec ause of their high profile, visiting a country as an independent U.N. expert can be a political minefield. Therefore, an effective country visit depends on thorough and substantive prepara-tion by the independent expert and his or her staff before, during and after a visit. Close con-sultation with a range of relevant actors, includ-ing OHCHR, treaty bodies and U.N. country team staff, government officials, human rights defenders and experts, political party leaders and parliamentarians to understand the politi-cal context and identify the main challenges is critical to a successful mission. 11. The me dia play an essential role in amplifying the main points of the visit and creating some pressure for governments to respond. Typically, SPs brief the media upon arrival in a country to explain the terms of their mandate and purpose of the visit then refrain from any further public statements until a departure press conference in which the expert provides initial observations regarding the subject under review along with some recommendations. Preceding this public report, which is generally well-covered by the media, the Special Procedure briefs govern-ment officials, giving them an opportunity to provide initial reactions to the expert directly and to the press, subsequently. This process of private consultation and public reporting is well regarded by most actors involved and should be considered a good practice. 26 Public statements by SPs before arriving in country, on the other hand, can complicate a country visit unless they are scrupulously neutral. 12. It ta kes several months for Special Procedures to prepare and issue their final reports, which are closely read by government officials and human rights activists alike. From the point of view of human rights advocates on the ground, however, it is the substantive public statements made by the Special Procedures while in coun-try, particularly during the concluding press conference, that matters most. Waiting a year or more for a final report in a foreign language can often deflate the momentum generated by the visit. When it does happen, presentation of the report to the Council through brief \"inter - active dialogues\" with member states is anticli-mactic, often overshadowed by other concerns on the agenda and loses it punch, particularly for the country in question. 27 Broad dissemi- nation of the final report in country is uneven and rarely available in local languages or only after much delay. 13. While s tates are generally encouraged to en- gage in a dialogue and cooperate with SPs, most do not file official responses to country visits, thereby making it difficult to analyze how states themselves evaluate the final report delivered to the U.N. or what action they take in response. Based on interviews conducted by the project team, states that have accepted country visits use the opportunity to provide background and context to the issues under discussion and to engage in direct dialogue with the SPs as they prepare their reports. 28 26 The Manual of Operations of the Special Procedures sets forth this process in paragraphs 71-72. 27 Some rapporteurs reported a higher quality, more substantive interactive dialogue in New Y ork. 28 Draft reports generally are submitted to the government four to six weeks before publication to allow it to correct any misunderstandings or fact ual inaccuracies, according to the Manual of Procedures, para. 74. See also Code of Conduct, Art. 13(c) (\"mandate holders shall ensure that the concerned government authorities are the first recipients of their conclusions and recommendations concerning this State and given adequate time to respond... \").13CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human RightsSome government officials, however, express disappointment that their input is not always fully reflected in the final reports. In more dramatic cases, governments react very badly to criticism by special rapporteurs, especially when delivered in language perceived as un-duly harsh or aggressive, and go so far as to block any substantive consideration of the report. 14. Star ting in 2004, the Commission on Hu- man Rights strongly encouraged states to of-fer standing invitations to Special Procedures as a way to facilitate their access to a country in a timely way. 29 Currently, only 72 member states have issued standing invitations, al-though many more states allow visits in prac-tice. 30 When broken down by regional group, stark differences emerge with African and Asian governments representing only a small fraction of countries on the list of standing invitations. 15. In genera l, a country's issuance of a standing invitation to Special Procedure visits results in easier access to that country. Of the 72 states that have issued standing invitations, all those which have received requests for visits (64) have accepted them at least once. 31 On the other hand, of the remaining 120 29 Commission on Human Rights Resolution 2004/76, Human rights and special procedures, para. 2(b), available at <http://daccess-dds-ny. un.org/do c/UNDOC/GEN/G04/162/00/PDF/G0416200.pdf?OpenElement>. 30 Of the top ten most visited states\u2014Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guatemala, Haiti, Israel/Occupied Pales tinian Territories, Mexico, Sudan and the United States\u2014four have issued standing invitations (Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico). 31 Eight of these (11 percent) have not received a request for a visit. These eight states are Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Iceland, Luxembourg, Mon aco, Montenegro, and San Marino.SI (Standing Invitation ) NSI a60Number of C ountries Standing Invitations by UN Regional GroupNumber of C ountrie s UN Regional Gr oup 4449 746 19 151826 3 14CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightsstates that have failed to issue a standing in- vitation, 44 (36 percent) have never received a visit, and 19 of these states carry a total of 41 unfulfilled visit requests. 32 Looked at an - other way, since 1998, states that have issued standing invitations have received four visits and maintain one and a half pending visits from Special Procedures, while those that have not issued standing invitations have re-ceived three visits and maintain nearly three pending visits. 33 Of course, there are notable exceptions to this trend and country behav-ior varies in practice. Iran, for instance, has issued a standing invitation but has not al-lowed a country visit since 2005 and cur - rently maintains seven pending visits. Some requests for permission to visit are known to have languished for over ten years; even once a government accepts a request to visit, it can take over five years for the visit to take place. Perversely, because SPs cannot visit a country without the government's permis-sion, non-cooperating states with serious hu-man rights problems like Zimbabwe, Libya, Eritrea and Syria can evade scrutiny by SPs while states that allow visits inevitably get more attention. 16. Befo re the visit takes place, SPs and states engage in direct negotiations on the terms of reference for the visit, which are spelled out in the SP's Manual of Procedures. These guidelines include freedom of movement, ac-cess to all prisoners and places of detention, and confidential and unsupervised contact with witnesses, who must be protected from reprisals. 34 Negotiations are often complicat- ed by a state's desire to influence the timing, scope and itinerary of an expert's visit as well as to spread out the workload of multiple reporting requirements. It is up to each rap-porteur to decide whether the conditions of the visit would compromise his or her ability to independently monitor the human rights 32 As of June 2010, the 19 states that have never accepted a request for a country visit are: Congo, DPRK, Eritrea, Gambia, Gabon, Guinea, Guin ea-Bissau, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Namibia, Nauru, Seychelles, Swaziland, Syria and Zimbabwe. Namibia, however, received its request in 2010 and Syria received its first special rapporteur in September 2010. Another 25 states that have not issued a standing invitation have never received a request for a visit. 33 For the purpose of this study, \"pending visits\" is defined as requested visits and visits that have been agreed upon in principle but remained un scheduled. 34 See Annex III to Manual of Procedures, E/CN.41998/45 Appendix V . Protection of witnesses and their relatives is of growing concern due to n otorious attacks against them, most notably the murder of two human rights defenders in Kenya in 2009 after they met with the Special Rapporteur on summary, extrajudicial or arbitrary detention.0246 81 0 Zimbab we Eritrea Libyan Arab Jamahiriya Syria Malawi Mauritius Swaziland Seychelle s Nauru Namibia Marshall Islands Guinea-Bissau Gabon Congo Mali Madagascar Guinea9 4 4 3 3 3 2 2 1 1111111111States That Have Never Accepted Special Procedur es' Requests for Countr y Visits (1998-June 2010)15CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightssituation in the country. Granting exceptions to the standard terms of reference can pro-vide a bad precedent for other rapporteurs, opening the door for states to insist on easier terms for the next visit. China, for instance, exploited the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention's (WGAD) willingness to negoti-ate the terms of the visit on the ground and demanded the same terms from the Special Rapporteur on Torture, who declined the visit under these circumstances. 35 Effects on State Behavior 17. In gen eral, states have made modest but im- portant progress toward implementing the recommendations a Special Procedure makes after a country visit. The reasons why states take such actions are multiple and complex. In many cases, an SP's country visit serves as an important tool for elevating human rights issues to senior levels of government and gen-erating action to remedy the problem. Several human rights defenders explained that they did not see positive action by the government on an issue they had raised for years until the Special Procedure confirmed and called at-tention to the problem. 18. In so me cases, it is possible to draw a direct line between a Special Procedure's recom-mendation and a state's implementation of such an action. For example, the Special Rap-porteur on Migrants was able to use informa-tion he received regarding a secret agreement between the governments of Indonesia and Malaysia to prompt reforms. The bilateral agreement allowed Malaysian employers to take identity documents away from Indone-sian migrant workers, leading to many hu-man rights abuses. Government officials first denied the allegation, and then threatened retaliation if he insisted on including a refer - ence to the MOU in his report. After going ahead and publishing the discovery of the MOU, officials annulled the document, re-sulting in immediate improvements. 36 19. More recently, the Special Rapporteur for Ca mbodia was able to visit two journalists im- prisoned on defamation charges, and quickly secured better treatment from the authorities; shortly after, one of the prisoners was released. One of the journalists' relatives publicly cred-ited the rapporteur for his freedom. 37 20. Typically, however, a direct connection be-tw een an SP's recommendation and govern- ment action is hard to prove. In part this is due to the fact that the relevant national au-thorities are not inclined to give credit to a U.N. mechanism for their actions or are moti-vated by other domestic political factors. 21. Durin g our research, we gathered numerous examples of positive steps taken by govern-ments after the issue was raised during an SP's country visit. Here are just a few illustrations (additional examples can be found in the Ap-pendix): 35 Sir Nigel Rodley, \"On Negotiating with Torturers, \" interviewed by Amy D.

According to various sources, employers may no longer hold a migrant's passport; other provisions, like improved working conditions, remain under discussion between the two governments. 37 Ros Rada, Letter to the Editor, Cambodia Daily , Ja nuary 29, 2010. According to the Special Rapporteur, a number of human rights organizations, both national and international, campaigning for their release deserve some credit for this outcome. 16CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human RightsEXAMPLES a. In 2004, the Independent Expert on the sit uation of human rights in Afghanistan successfully persuaded government au-thorities to release hundreds of illegally detained prisoners. Upon visiting the Pol-e Charkhi prison, the Independent Expert discovered that 734 Pakistani and Afghani detainees had been forcibly held in de-plorable conditions for more than thirty months. After presenting the information to the Minister of Justice in May 2004, President Karzai released 534 of these prisoners and later issued decrees to par - don various others. 38 Moreover, through documentation of substandard living and health conditions, the Independent Expert secured the visit of two doctors to the pris-on, resulting in the diagnosis and treat-ment of hundreds of cases of tuberculosis. b. In an other case during his tenure, the Inde- pendent Expert on Afghanistan uncovered and publicized unacceptable conditions in a women's prison in Afghanistan. Not only were many of these women imprisoned for crimes committed by family members but they were forced to raise their children within the confines of the prison. In ad-dition to publishing this information in a country mission report, the Independent Expert encouraged government authori-ties to improve prison conditions, result-ing in increased budget allocations for food and supplies. Each prisoner received a second blanket and plastic sheets so they could create private corridors. Addition-ally, government officials ensured monthly inspections by authorities and weekly vis-its by doctors. 39 c. The SR on human rights of internally dis-pl aced persons helped shape and imple- ment IDP policy in Turkey after making a country visit in 2002 and conducting a follow up working visit in 2005. Upon his recommendations, the government de-cided to gather data and statistics on IDPs that had previously been lacking, to train local governors on the Guiding Principles on treatment of IDPs, and to begin to ad-dress questions of compensation for prop-erty lost as a result of displacement. 40 The question of the number of IDPs in Turkey had become a hot political issue with es-timates varying from a few thousand to more than two million. The decision by the government to commission an inde-pendent study on the number of IDPs was thus an important step in developing plans to address the concerns of the displaced and human rights groups that worked with them. The SR encouraged provincial au-thorities to develop action plans to address internal displacement and provided tech-nical assistance to them, particularly in the case of Van province. The development of laws and policies to provide compensation for IDPs who had lost property is another area where the SRSG was able to provide necessary technical assistance. 38 Report of the Independent Expert of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, September 21, 2004, pp. 5 an d 20. U.N. Doc: A/59/370. 39 Cherif Bassiouni served as Independent Expert on human rights in Afghanistan from 2004 -2006, pres enting two reports to the Human Rights Commission and General Assembly: A/59/370 and E/CN.4/2005/122. Examples of impact found in the reports were augmented by an interview with the former mandate holder on March 12, 2010. 40 Hacettepe University's Institute of Populations Studies conducts the Turkey migration and Internally Displaced Persons Survey annually and ques tionnaire for the survey was \"prepared in guidance of the United Nations' Internally Displaced Persons Guiding Principles. \" For more information see <http://www.hips.hacettepe.edu.tr/eng/dokumanlar/TMIDPS_press_release.pdf>.17CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightsd. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summ ary and arbitrary executions visited Colombia in 2009 and revived media and international scrutiny of the ongoing fal - sos positivos or false positives scandal. For years, NGOs had been gathering and pub-licizing information regarding executions of unarmed civilians by military person-nel who would falsely present the victims as guerilla fighters. The scandal came to a head in 2008 with the Soacha tragedy that resulted in nearly two dozen cases of falsos positivos. The government consistently de- nied a problem until the high-profile Soa-cha killings, at which time it dismissed 27 military officials, including three generals. The Special Rapporteur's visit\u2014amidst the scandal\u2014served to confirm the allega-tions of victims' relatives and civil society, determine that soldiers received certain privileges and benefits from their com-manders in return for guerrilla \"captures, \" and encourage further dismissals, investi-gations and prosecutions of perpetrators. The Special Rapporteur was able to raise his concerns directly with President Uribe and other high-level officials. His findings lent further credence to the understanding that the murders were committed by ele-ments of the military and were not isolated occurrences, and helped secure additional arrests and prosecutions. 41 e. The Sp ecial Rapporteur on torture con- ducted a particularly tumultuous coun-try visit to Spain in 2003 that resulted in an 80-page response from the govern-ment that challenged nearly every recom-mendation issued by the mandate holder. Nevertheless, one of the Special Rapporteur's recommendations was taken up and has resulted in tangible results. To prevent tor - ture and ill treatment, the mandate holder suggested that video cameras be installed in all interrogation rooms. The govern-ment first responded by explaining why this recommendation was not feasible. In a 2007 follow up, however, the govern-ment indicated that it was in the process of determining the viability of video re-cording in interrogation rooms. 42 By 2008, the government ordered the installation of video cameras in detention areas in police and Guardia Civil stations. Despite the government's original rejection of the rap-porteur's report, the recommendations ul-timately contributed to improved detainee treatment. 43 Key Factors to Explain Impact of Country Visits 22. Sev eral factors emerge as key ingredients for facilitating positive action by governments in response to a country visit. These include: a. The cr edibility of the United Nations in the country concerned as the premier global body to develop and uphold universal norms and foster international coopera-tion. The moral power of the U.N. 's\"blue stationery, \" the international backing it conveys, and the public attention a U.N. expert commands often yield significant pressure to generate positive state action. b. The ti ming of the visit as it relates to a coun- try's political and human rights situation. Countries in transition, moving away from conflict or authoritarian rule and toward a more open, peaceful and democratic 41 Report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Mission to Colombia. U.N. Doc: A/HRC/14/24/Add.2. 42 Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture, follow up to country visits. U.N. Doc: A/HRC/7/3/Add.2 43 Many government and NGO representatives interviewed over the course of the project confirmed this impact of the visit.18CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightssociety, tend to offer more opportuni- ties for external influence than countries locked in civil conflict or burdened by a closed system. In intensely polarized situ-ations, opposing sides will seek to manipu-late a rapporteur's visit and report to their own advantage, hindering impact. This is not to say, however, that efforts to en-gage closed regimes or conflict situations should be dropped as the U.N. expert often offers the only avenue for human rights is-sues to be examined and publicly aired. c. The qu ality and specificity of the SP's re- search, analysis and recommendations and the level of preparation before a vis-it. On the one hand, it was strongly felt by key government and non-government actors that a well-grounded report with solid evidence, strong legal arguments and concrete recommendations is one of the most important elements for achiev-ing progress. 44 On the other hand, general, aspirational recommendations have little impact and make follow-up difficult. In some cases, factual mistakes or statements by SPs perceived as unduly harsh or unbal-anced were used by states and others to at-tack and undermine not only the SPs' work but that of other U.N. actors as well. The language, tone and style a rapporteur uses matters almost as much as the content of what he or she has to say. Positive words acknowledging progress where it exists can go a long way toward helping govern-ment officials accept the more critical find-ings of a rapporteur's report. As one senior government official explained, a report that failed to present the government's side of the story was \"thrown into the trash. \"d. The wi llingness of the relevant government to cooperate with the SP's visit. For example, a well-placed, sympathetic official or leading parliamentarian can often make a difference in facilitating the SP's work and implemen-tation of recommendations. The willingness and ability of the government to organize inter-ministerial coordination mechanisms to address concerns raised by the SPs is an-other important factor. Conversely, obstruc-tion and interference by government agents can frustrate or neutralize the SPs' work. Some government officials have unrealistic expectations that the expert's mission is to endorse state policy rather than serve as an objective critic and shut down cooperation in the wake of a negative report. e. The ab ility of local and international NGOs and victims' groups to communicate their grievances in a timely and effective manner and to engage in follow-up advocacy. In many cases, the principal reason any fol-low-up action was taken by governments was due to a persistent NGO adopting the SP's recommendations as a platform for a long-term advocacy campaign. In North-ern Ireland, for example, a coalition led by British Irish Rights Watch worked closely with the Special Rapporteur on the In-dependence of Judges and Lawyers (Mr. Param Cumaraswamy) to prepare his visit and to follow up his recommendations. After six years of determined advocacy, all but one of his recommendations had been implemented by the relevant government authorities. On the other hand, special rapporteurs must be vigilant to the risk of being manipulated by nongovernmental groups who seek to use their visits as part 44 The Manual of Procedures, para. 98, states that SP recommendations should be SMART: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time- bo und. 19CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightsof a propaganda campaign to allege human rights abuses against the government with-out substantiation. f. The le vel of freedom of the media to report on an SP's activities. In most countries, a visit by a senior U.N. expert generates widespread attention which is greatly en-hanced by a robust and well-briefed media corps. Here again, the established practice of SPs reporting their findings to the press at the end of their visit is well-received by states and SPs alike. On the other hand, the SP's ready access to the media can complicate the mission, prompting strong government criticism. The seminal case, decided in favor of the Special Procedures in 1999, involved a $112 million claim of defamation filed by the government of Malaysia against Param Cumaraswamy, the Special Rapporteur for Independence of Judges and Lawyers. Eventually, the International Court of Justice ruled that U.N. special rapporteurs must be regard-ed as \"experts on mission\" and accorded certain privileges and immunities such as exemption from defamation charges. 45 Other more recent examples include the critical U.S. response to statements made by the SRSG for Internally Displaced Per - sons regarding its actions after Hurricane Katrina, Spain's denunciation of the Spe-cial Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while coun-tering terrorism regarding comments on his visit to the Basque country, and Bra-zil's public attack on the Special Rappor - teur on the Right to Food in response to his comments regarding genocide. g. The ca pacity of and attention paid by the U.N. country team and other relevant U.N. agen-cies like the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the U.N. Development Pro-gram. The potential contribution of these U.N. actors to the success of a country visit is great but in practice has varied. The U.N. presence ranges in size and capacity from a small country office with only a few staff ca-pable of providing assistance before, during or after an SP's visit, to a major field pres-ence with dozens of in-country staff well-positioned to help organize the visit, provide advice to the SPs on key elements, and in-corporate their findings and recommenda-tions in the workplan after the visit. Some U.N. country teams prefer to remain at arms length from the SPs due to the sensitive top-ics they raise. Others admit that the rap-porteurs can say tough things that need to be said and that their reports help make the case for reforms and technical assistance. FoLLoW-UP To Co UNTRY VISITS 23. What happens after a country visit remains on e of the most challenging questions for the U.N. human rights system. A number of good practices have been established largely on the initiative of a few rapporteurs with additional resources. These include ongoing requests for information from the government concerned, questionnaires to key stakeholders, annual reporting to the HRC on the status of a state's progress or lack thereof, and follow-up visits by the rapporteur or his or her successor. 24. There is, however, no institutionalized mech- anism for follow-up to an SP's country visit. 45 Difference Relating to Immunity From Legal Process of a Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion of 29 Ap ril 1999, International Court of Justice, available at <http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/100/7619.pdf>.

Only in a few cases, usually when additional resources are available, has an SP methodically reported on a state's implementation of recommenda-tions. 46 Similarly, a current or successor SP has carried out visits to the same country two or more years later with the express purpose of tracking progress on previous recommen-dations. The Special Procedures on internally displaced persons and on indigenous peoples have conducted the most follow-up visits. 47 Others that have conducted follow up visits are the Special Procedures on independence of judges and lawyers, human rights defend-ers, housing and migrants. 25. Wit h the exception of most of the OHCHR field presences, the U.N. Country Team and other U.N. actors have not always been keen or reliable partners in this endeavor while NGO campaigns tend to be ad hoc, under-resourced or overcome by more urgent mat-ters. The new Universal Periodic Review mechanism (UPR) does allow an SP's recom-mendations for a specific country to receive renewed attention at least once during that country's four-year cycle of peer reviews, but it is premature to say what effect this has on a member state's implementation of the recom-mendations. (See section below on UPR for more information.) CoMMUNICATI oNS 26. According to OHCHR, since 2005 alone, Spe-cia l Procedures with thematic mandates have sent more than 5,000 communications to hundreds of member states on behalf of thou-sands of victims of human rights violations. 48 When tallying communications, OHCHR counts a communications sent by multiple mandate holders once. 46 The Special Procedures on torture, extrajudicial summary and arbitrary executions, and housing make a point of sending follow up ques tionnaires to countries they or their predecessors have visited and publishing results as follow up reports. 47 The former visited Azerbaijan in 1998, 2007, 2010; Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2005 and 2008; the Central African Republic in 2008 and 2009; th e Democratic Republic of Congo in 2008 and 2009; Georgia in 2000, 2005, and 2008; Sri Lanka in 2007 and 2009; Sudan in 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2005; and Uganda in 2000 and 2009. The latter visited Chile in 2003 and 2009; Colombia in 2004 and 2009; Guatemala in 2002 and 2010. For a full list, see the OHCHR compilation of country visits located in the Appendix or accessible at <http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/countryvisitsa-e.htm#burundi>. 48 Facts and Figures 2005, p. 2, available at <http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/docs/facts_figures_2005.pdf>; Facts and Figures 2006, p . 3, available at <http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/docs/facts_figures_2006.pdf>; Facts and Figures 2007, p. 17, available at <http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/docs/SP2007FactsFigures.pdf>; Facts and Figures 2008, p. 7, available at <http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/docs/Facts_Figures2008.pdf>; Facts and Figures 2009, p. 8, available at <http:// www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/docs/Facts_Figures2009.pdf>. Note: The 2009 OHCHR statistics do not include data from the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID) in the overall number of communications sent by Special Procedures because the group uses unique working methods. According to the 2009 annual report of the WGEID covering the period 5 December 2008 to 13 November 2009, the WGEID transmitted 456 new cases of enforced disappearance to 25 governments. For purposes of this report, the number of communications sent in 2009 is an aggregate of OHCHR's 689 figure and WGEID's 456 new cases for a total of 1,145. 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Total Communications 1,049 1,115 1,003 911 1,145 Government Recipients 137 143 119 Individuals Implicated 2,545 2,869 2,994 2,206 2,29621CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rights27. For the scope of this study, from 2004 to 2008, 17 th ematic Special Procedures (not including the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention or the Working Group on Disap-pearances) sent 8,713 communications to 174 states and ten non-state actors. 49 These figures are higher than those of OHCHR be-cause the research team counted all commu-nications recorded by each mandate in their annual reports from 2004-2008, irrespective of whether or not the communication was re-corded by more than one mandate holder. 50 Some states received far more communica-tions than others. According to OHCHR, the highest recipients in 2009 were Iran with 42 total communications, Mexico with 37, and China with 35. 51 According to our study, the top four recipients over the course of the five years studied were similarly Iran with 594 communications, China with 500, Colombia with 348 and Mexico in a close fourth with 305. These four countries alone account for nearly 20% of all communications received by states. Half of all communications issued in the same period went to 17 governments. 28. Accor ding to the HRC's Code of Conduct, communications from Special Procedures should be based on information \"submitted by a person or group of persons claiming to be a victim of violations or by a person or group of persons, including non-governmental orga-nizations, acting in good faith in accordance with human rights...and claiming to have direct or reliable knowledge of those viola-tions substantiated by clear information. The 49 Non-state recipients of communications from 2004-2008 were the World Bank, Syngenta, ITM Angola, the Global Fund, Coca Cola Co mpany, Asian Development Bank, Agence Francaise de Developement, Newmont Ghana Gold Limited, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the U.N. Mission in Kosovo and were sent by the Special Procedures on Food, Health, Housing, Sale of Children, Toxic Waste, and Violence Against Women. This trend of examining the effects non-state actors have on respect for human rights is new and deserves further study. 50 While special procedures do send the majority of communications with at least one other rapporteur, these are not necessarily recorded ident ically in the official documentation made available by OHCHR\u2014different dates may be recorded, records may not include an identical list of all mandate holders collaborating, and the focus of the summarized allegation and government response may differ from communication to communication depending on the focus of the mandate holder at hand. Therefore, since many joint communications were not recorded as pure duplicates, we deemed it necessary to account for all communications logged by special procedures during this period. Similarly, state responses were counted as they were recorded in special procedure communications documents. 51 Facts and Figures 2009, p. 10, available at <http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/docs/Facts_Figures2009.pdf>. 0 100 200300 400 500 600 Iran China Colombia Mexico Nepal Sudan India Russian F ederation Uzbekista n Pakista n Democratic R epublic of C ongo Syria Myanmar Tunisia Bangladesh Guatemala Philippines549 500 348 305 297 250 249 217 215 213 202 195 175 165 164 161 16017 Sta tes Have Received Mor e Than Half of all Special Procedures Communications (2004- 2008)22CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightscommunication should not be exclusively based on reports disseminated by mass me-dia. \" 52 Unfortunately, there is no formalized, consistent procedure for cataloguing corre-spondence received from parties requesting intervention by the Special Procedures; each rapporteur ultimately has the discretion to decide which allegations to act upon. There-fore, it is impossible to determine how many appeals for action the Special Procedures re-ceive on an annual basis or to determine what percentage of requests is acted upon. The treaty bodies, on the other hand, have a for - mal procedure for the submission of individ-ual complaints and formal criteria for deter - mining admissibility. In 2009, treaty bodies received 9,900 pieces of correspondence, of which only 110 were considered admissible individual complaints. 53 29. Comm unications by SPs generally take the form of letters of allegation or urgent appeals that are transmitted to the state involved via its diplomatic mission in Geneva. Urgent ap-peals alert state authorities to time-sensitive and life-threatening violations of an ongoing or imminent nature while letters of allega-tion convey information of a past incident of lesser urgency. They serve an important role in establishing a written record of victims' complaints and putting them into appropri-ate government channels. Human rights de-fenders complain, however, that they do not receive confirmation from OHCHR that their correspondence has been registered or what, if any, action was taken by the SP in response. 30. As fur ther detailed below, in a fair number of cases, the SP communications process does generate positive movement by a state toward addressing the underlying violation. Several examples stand out, as illustrated in the sum-mary of state replies found below and in the Appendix. In terms of a state's timeliness and quality of response, however, this mechanism has a generally disappointing record of influ-ence on the state concerned. 31. Of the t otal 8,713 communications issued by 17 thematic mandate holders between 2004 and 2008 (not counting the Working Groups on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and on Arbitrary Detentions), a majority of communications (58.56%) received no or im-material responses by states, making impact assessment virtually impossible. 32. Over t he same five-year period for the same 17 mandates, responses that demonstrated governments took steps to address the under - lying allegation or initiated concrete action to determine the validity of the allegation repre-sented 18.31% of responses. A slightly higher number, 21%, represented responses in which the government rejected the substance of the violation without indicating what steps were taken to investigate the underlying claim. 33. These t rends vary in notable ways across the five official U.N. regional groups, with some exceptions. The Africa group, recipient of 20% of all communications, had the highest rate of no or immaterial responses with 73.16%, and the lowest rate of responses that indicated actions taken to address the allegation with only 7% in this category. The Eastern Eu-rope Group (EEG)\u2014recipients of only 6.4% of communications\u2014maintained the lowest 52 HRC Code of Conduct, Article 9 (d) and (e). 53 OHCHR 2009 Report, Activities and Results, p. 12, available at <http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/I_OHCHR_Rep_2009_ com plete_final.pdf>.23CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human RightsMandate total # nr subto tal subtotal Ed35 2 18 4 - No R esponse ri - R esponsive but Incomplete iM - Immat erial Response st - Step s Taken to Address Allegation vr - V iolation Rejected without Substantiation in - In translation F or further Information on scoring, please see Appendix H.

By far, this regional group maintains the lowest rate of unsubstantiated rejections with only 8.6% in this category. Y et, states in this group carry the second largest no or immaterial response rate with 57.4%\u2014a tie in this category with the Asia group, the largest recipient of com- munications. 55 34. The dat a also reveals some notable differ - ences in the way democracies and non-de- mocracies respond to SP communications. Democratic governments for this purpose are defined as those states invited to participate in the Ministerial Conference of the Com-munity of Democracies (CD) held in Lisbon, Portugal in 2009, with non-democracies de-fined as all those not making the list of invit-ed participants. 56 Democratic governments have a significantly higher positive response rate to SP communications and a lower rate of non-replies. Specifically, CD governments achieve a combined score of 28% in the Steps Taken and Responsive but Incomplete cat-egories, while non-democracies score 11%. 54 The Africa and Asia Groups are each composed of 53 member states; GRULAC has 33 member states; WEOG is made up of 29 member sta tes, including for this study's purpose Israel and the United States; and EEG maintains 23. 55 When non state actors are considered when analyzing responsiveness, they carry the lowest rate of no or immaterial responses with 42.8% and t he highest rate of responsive communications with 57.14%. In no case did a non state actor unsubstantially or categorically deny the allegation. 56 The Community of Democracies is the only global intergovernmental forum of democratic governments aimed at fostering cooperation to st rengthen and support democratic development. The Convening Group that organizes their meetings invites governments to biennial ministerial meetings based on a set of criteria drawn from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international standards.

By is olating all 4,248 communications that received responses from governments, we learned that it takes an average 124 days for a mandate holder to receive a response. On the low end, there are a few dozen cases of same day replies; on the longer end, it can take years. Bangladesh, for example, took six years to respond to two communica-tions sent by the Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children in 2004. Of all commu-nications that received responses, 17.35% were received within 30 days, 20.2% were received within one to two months, and 43.5% were received in the two to six month range. Cumulatively, 81% of governments that responded did so within six months of receiving the communication. Correspond-ingly, within each response (quality) cat-egory, the most frequent response time was two to six months: 42% of all responses that rejected the violation without substantia-tion were received in this range while 47% of all responses that indicated government action fell in this range. Interestingly, those responses that presented immaterial infor - mation did not follow this trend\u201448% were received within two months.Immaterial Response No Response Violation Rejected Without Substantiation Responsive but Incomplete In Translation Steps Taken to Address Allegation26CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rights Less than 30 da ys 1 - 2 ye ars 2 - 6 months more than 2 ye ars6 months - 1 ye ar 1 - 12%253 6%42 1% 737 17% examples of communications that re- ceiv ed scores reflecting that steps were taken in response to the allegation include:57 Freeing Human Rights Defenders from Prison in Bahrain In November 2004, the then SRSG on human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal to the Kingdom of Bahrain on behalf of two human rights defenders who worked with an organiza-tion dedicated to helping victims of torture. In October they were arrested and detained with a dozen others for participating in a peaceful pro-test calling on authorities for a prisoner's release. A month later, the government responded to the Special Representative's urgent appeal, explaining that three weeks after receiving the communica-tion the King issued a directive ordering the re-lease of all persons arrested in the incident. 58 Holding Violators Accountable in India In May 2007, the Special Representative for hu- man rights defenders sent a letter of allegation on behalf of an LGBT activist in India who had been forcefully held in a police station and subjected to verbal and sexual assault. The government of India responded to the letter in November of the same year, explaining that while no complaint had been filed by the alleged victim, the Office of the Superintendent of Police led an inquiry and discovered misbehavior by two officers. Depart-mental action was underway at the time of send-ing the communication. 59 Protecting Protestors in Brazil In April 2008, the Special Rapporteurs on free- dom of expression, housing and human rights defenders sent a letter of allegation to the govern-ment of Brazil on behalf of a human rights pro-testor attacked during a demonstration against the building of a dam and the subsequent dis-placement of local communities by the project. The government responded in October of the same year confirming the facts of the attack and explaining that the victim had received medical treatment and that the perpetrator had been ar - rested and indicted. 60 57 All examples are taken directly from communications documents annexed to annual reports submitted by Special Procedures to the Human Rig hts Council or Special Procedures Bulletins available on the OHCHR website. 58 Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights defenders, Summary of cases transmitted to Governments an d replies received, March 16, 2005, pp. 16-17.

Within three months, the government replied to the communication confirming the facts. After conducting a criminal investigation, it was con-firmed that a police officer was the perpetrator of the threats alleged. He was suspended from his work and disciplinary actions were instituted against him. 61 Working groups: specialized Working Methods, Better resul ts? There are currently four thematic Working Groups operating in the system of Special Pro-cedures: on African descent, on arbitrary de-tention, on enforced or involuntary disappear - ances, and the Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of impeding the exer - cise of the right of peoples to self-determination (Mercenaries). While these mandates serve the same general purpose of promoting and pro-tecting human rights as the individual rappor - teurs and experts, their working methods differ, and therefore deserve separate consideration. Working Groups include five members, one from each of the five U.N. regional groups, one of whom serves as Chairperson-Rappor - teur. In several interviews, U.N. experts, NGO representatives, and government officials pointed to this geographic diversity as a particu-lar asset, explaining that it is much more difficult for hostile governments to justify noncompli-ance by claiming that these special procedures are beholden to a regional group or individual sponsor. On the other hand, having five mem-bers from each region can complicate collabo-ration, communication, and consensus. They may speak different languages, must coordinate schedules and time zones to communicate, and travel long distances to meet in-person. In spite of these challenges and pursuant to their re-spective themes, the Working Groups have de-veloped distinct working methods to promote and protect human rights. For the purpose of this study, the Working Groups on Arbitrary Detention and on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances\u2014two of the oldest mandates in the system and with a well-documented re-cord of activity\u2014were subject to quantitative analysis. 62 61 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression pp. 140-141. U.N. Do c:A/HRC/11/4/Add.1. 62 The Working Group on African Descent neither publicizes nor documents a communications or complaints procedure and was hence omitted from quantitative analysis. Established in 2002 after the 2001 Durban World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, the Group is mandated to \"study the problems of racial discrimination faced by people of African descent living in the Diaspora and to this end gather all relevant information from Governments, non-governmental organizations and other relevant sources, including through holding public meetings with them. \" To execute its mandate, the Group submits annual reports to the Human Rights Council, conducts country visits, and convenes a five-day meeting annually. For more information on the Working Group on African Descent, see: <http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/racism/groups/african/4african.htm>. The Working Group on Mercenaries was established in 2005 and falls outside the scope of the project's methodology for quantitative consideration. The Group is mandated \"to elaborate and present concrete proposals on possible new standards, general guidelines or basic principles encouraging the further protection of human rights, in particular the right of peoples to self-determination, while facing current and emergent threats posed by mercenaries or mercenary-related activities\" among other tasks. To execute its mandate it receives communications, renders opinions, issues urgent actions, and conducts country visits. It has recently tabled a draft convention regulating private security companies for intergovernmental consideration. For more information on the Working Group on the use of Mercenaries, see: <http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/mercenaries/index.htm>.28CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human RightsWorking Group on Arbitrary Detention Established in 1991, the Working Group on Ar - bitrary Detention (WGAD) is mandated to in- vestigate individual allegations of deprivation of liberty, generate information on arbitrary deten-tion to help states prevent or stem the practice, and report annually to the Human Rights Coun-cil. 63 To carry out these tasks the Group has de- veloped four primary working methods. First, it investigates individual cases to evaluate whether or not international legal norms have been vio-lated. 64 Second, the Group formulates \"delibera- tions\" on general matters to help develop consis-tent principles. Third, it sends an \"urgent action\" in cases where a person's health or life is at grave risk, and fourth, the Group conducts country visits to establish direct dialogue with govern-ment officials and civil society. 65 When considering an individual case, the Group first reviews a communication received from a complainant and transmits it to the government in question, requesting comments within 90 days. The government response, if any, is sent to the complainant for comment. The Group then is-sues an opinion to determine whether or not the detention is arbitrary. 66 In this sense, the Group helps facilitate dialogue between the complainant and the government.67 The Group transmits its opinion to the government with recommenda-tions and sends it to the source three weeks later; opinions are also published in the annex of the WGAD's annual report to the Council. This thorough, consultative process has pro- duced positive results and the highest response rates of all special procedures examined in this report. However, because the process is time consuming and opinions can only be is-sued when all five members are together, less than fifty are issued annually. The quantitative analysis of states' cooperation with the Work-ing Group was based on its considerations of individual cases and opinions issued in reports published from 2004 to 2008. During this time period, the WGAD issued 189 opinions to 58 countries. Governments failed to respond to cases only 20% of the time\u2014remarkably lower than the over 50% non-reply rates to individual mandate holders. In 8% of cases, governments provided immaterial responses. Governments were responsive to allegations in 25% of cases and in 27% of the cases the government indi-cated that the individual in question had been released, without a finding that the detention was arbitrary. Governments rejected the allega-tion outright in 20% of cases. 63 Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Fact Sheet No. 26, The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, par III (B). For full doc ument, see: <http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet26en.pdf>. 64 Generally, the Group's involvement is prompted by the receipt of a communication but in certain circumstances it can take up cases on its ow n initiative. 65 Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Fact Sheet No. 26, The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, par V . 66 If the government does not reply, the WGAD may consider the case and issue a recommendation. If the Group does receive a response fr om the government, it forwards it to the source for more information. When the Group is ready to make a decision it issues one of five opinions: 1. If the person is released, the case is filed but the Group reserves the right to render an opinion as to whether or not the detention was arbitrary; 2. If the Group considers that the case is not one of arbitrary detention, it will render an opinion accordingly; 3. If the Group considers more information is required from the Government or the source, it may keep the case pending until the information is received; 4. If the Group is unable to obtain sufficient information on a case, it may file the case provisionally or definitively; 5. If the group decides that arbitration deprivation of liberty did occur it will render an opinion accordingly and make recommendations to the government.

This excellent account of the Working Group's methods of work further states that the individual complaints procedure \"not only initiates a dialogue among the source, the government, and the WGAD, but also facilitates international coordination and cooperation by sharing information at its disposal with any United Nations Organ wishing to have such information. \"29CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human RightsResponse rates across regions vary in notable ways. The Asia group, recipient of 52% of all cases, had the highest rate of responses that re-jected the violation with 30% in this category. The Africa group, recipients of 17% of cases, had the highest no response rate with 27% of cases in this category. The Latin America and Caribbean Group (GRULAC) received 10% of cases over the five-year period and had the low-est rate of no response with 5% in this category and the highest rate of released individuals, with 50% in this group. The Eastern European Group (EEG) received the smallest number of cases, representing only 4% of the caseload but maintained the highest rate of responsive replies with 50% of responses indicating some govern-ment action to address the violation. The West-ern Europe and Others Group (WEOG) group received 17% of the caseload and presented the lowest percentage of responses that rejected the allegations outright, with only 3% in this cate-gory. While the Group sent cases to 58 govern-ments over the five years, 56% of the caseload was directed to ten governments. China, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Mexico were the top five recipients of cases with 20, 18, 16, 13, and eight cases received respectively over the five-year period. 68 The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances The Working Group on Enforced or Involun- tary Disappearances (WGEID) was established in 1980 to assist relatives to ascertain the fate and whereabouts of their disappeared family. 69 To carry out its mandate, the WGEID engages in four principal working methods. First, it transmits individual cases to governments for clarification, acting as a channel of communica-tion between victims' families and governments. Second, it meets three times annually to make decisions on cases and transmit them to the gov-ernment in question. Third, it conducts country visits to establish dialogue with government and NGO officials on the ground. And, fourth, the WGEID reports to the Council annually to pres-ent its findings and cases. In addition to these major activities, the group has been tasked, since 1992, with monitoring state compliance with the U.N. Declaration on the Protection of All Per - sons from Enforced Disappearances and report-ing on progress. 70 When considering an individual case, the WGEID acts on information received. Those that pass standards of admissibility are forwarded to governments with a request for investigation and to keep the WGEID apprised of developments. Any replies from governments are sent to the source for comment and if the source challenges the government's submission, this information is re-sent to the government before the Group considers the case clarified, closed, or discon-tinued. A case is considered clarified when the source fails to respond to the government reply within six months or when the source challenges the government responses on grounds that are 68 The next five recipients from 2004-2008 were Myanmar with seven cases and Algeria, Colombia, Egypt, and Iraq with six each. In a study con ducted by Jared Genser & Margaret Winterkorn-Meikle, the top ten recipient countries similarly made up 48% of the WGAD's caseload from 1992-2006 but the distribution differed. In their analysis, the top ten recipients were: Peru, China, Cuba, Syria, Israel, Vietnam, Myanmar, United States, Tunisia, and Turkey.

Opendocument>.30CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightsconsidered unreasonable to the WGEID. If the source challenges the government's response on reasonable grounds, the information is sent to the government for comment. Cases are con-sidered closed when national authorities, with concurrence of the relatives of the disappeared, pronounces the individual deceased, and cases are considered discontinued in the rare sce-nario that family does not wish to pursue the case or when the source is no longer able to fol-low up on the case and WGEID's efforts to es-tablish alternative channels of communication have proved unsuccessful. According to the WGEID, it has received more than 50,000 indi-vidual cases in more than 80 countries since its inception in 1980. Only 20% of these cases have been clarified by governments in question. 71 It follows up regularly with governments that maintain outstanding cases, sending annual re-minders of all cases that haven't been clarified and semi-annual reminders regarding urgent actions that remain unclarified. When examining the WGEID, the project con- sidered individual cases sent to governments from 2004-2008. In many of these cases, resub-missions of cases sent in previous years were in-cluded. Over the five-year period, the WGEID sent 269 communications to 59 governments. A given communication could contain one or hundreds of individual allegations. In 44% of cases, the government provided no response whatsoever while in 32% of cases, WGEID in-dicated that information from the government had been received, but without sufficient de-tail in the summary to determine to which al-legation the response was directed. In 18% of cases, the government provided an immaterial response. Governments indicated that some ac-tion had been taken to address the allegation in only four percent of cases and in the remaining two percent of cases governments rejected the allegation outright. Regionally, the Asia group received 51% of all communications and maintained a lower than average no response rate with 35% in this cate-gory. The Africa group, recipients of 26% of the communications, maintained the highest rate of no responses with 63%. GRULAC, WEOG, and EEG received 17%, respectively. With only nine communica-tions received over the five-year period, WEOG maintained the highest rate of responses that rejected a violation outright with 22% in this category. The top ten recipients of communica-tions\u2014Colombia, Algeria, Nepal, Philippines, Russian Federation, Sudan, India, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia\u2014made up 55% of the caseload over the five-year period. However, since letters can contain more than one indi-vidual allegation, this list does not necessarily reflect the countries that received the most al-legations of individual disappearances. While the response rates from governments leave much to be desired, the Working Groups' annual statistical reporting and systematic and transparent follow-up should be considered a good practice. In each annual report, the WGEID presents an aggregate figure of total cases clarified and unclarified by each govern-ment. Of those cases that have been clarified, the WGEID indicates whether the source or the government provided the clarifying informa-tion. Without greater accountability of member states for failing to clarify the thousands of cases of disappearances still pending, however, im-provement is unlikely. 71 Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Fact Sheet No. 6, Rev. 3, p. 77.31CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human RightsDemanding Justice for Victims of Torture in Egypt In April 2004, the Special Rapporteur on Torture and Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Ex-ecutions sent a letter to the government of Egypt on behalf of a detainee arrested on suspicion of membership in an illegal organization, who was tortured in custody and died in transit from the police station to the hospital. The government confirmed the facts and explained that the De-partment of Public Prosecutions charged a police officer and sergeant with torture causing death. 72 37. While it is alarming that more than half of communications go unanswered by states, it is important to note that a government's fail-ure to respond in writing does not indicate that the communication has no effect. Gov-ernment officials, NGO representatives, and Special Procedures themselves have asserted that some communications have prompted action on a matter even though the govern-ment provided no official written response. RESoURCES 38. Although the level of support provided to th e Special Procedures has improved signifi- cantly over the last ten years, severely limited resources for the SPs' work continues to be a chronic weakness that clearly undermines the effectiveness of this mechanism. According to the 2009 OHCHR Annual Report, of the of-fice's $158.8 million in spending that year, $11 million was spent on Special Procedures\u2014a mere seven percent of total spending. 73 If these costs were divided evenly among the 39 Spe-cial Procedures that year, this would amount to only $280,000 allocated on average for each mandate. Of the $11 million spent on Special Procedures, $7.3 million came from the regu-lar U.N. budget and $3.9 million came from extra-budgetary donations in the form of voluntary contributions. Nearly half of extra-budgetary donations are spent on OHCHR field presences, another 14% is allocated to the Humanitarian Trust Funds, and only four percent is spent on Special Procedures. 74 39. The HRC 's independent experts work on a volunteer basis, with reimbursement only for travel-related expenses (travel costs, per diem and a 40 percent supplemental for two coun-try visits a year plus travel three times a year to Geneva and one trip to New Y ork if required to report to the General Assembly). OHCHR resources available to support thematic SPs cover on average only one staff person for each mandate, further limiting their ability to carry out their functions; country-specific rapporteurs get even less staff support. Actual allocated resources vary according to a needs assessment of such elements as a rapporteur's workplan, volume of communications and extraordinary circumstances (like the earth-quake disaster in Haiti). Given the heavy de-mands of taking on a position with virtually no compensation, some qualified experts may 72 Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Summary of Information, inc luding cases transmitted to Governments and replies received, March 30, 2005, pp 123-124.

Please note that OHCHR's 2009 report contains an apparent discrepancy on this figure. On page 19, it states that 7.5% of OHCHR's $158.8m in expenditures was spent on Special Procedures. This figure would be $11.9 million; however, pages 181-184 of the same report show that spending for Special Procedures, determined through line items with the term \"Special Procedures, \" equaled only $11 million, a figure which represents 7% of total expenditures, rather than 7.5%. This discrepancy is most likely explained by the fact that some spending occurs in other line items as special procedures are also supported by the Research and Right to Development Division and the Field Operations and Technical Cooperation Division, which is tasked with supporting country-specific mandate holders. Unfortunately, the OHCHR decided against providing us with the precise amount spent on Special Procedures, thus costs were estimated based on line items that make specific reference to the system. 74 OHCHR Annual Report, 2009, Financial Statements, pp. 180-199.32CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightsbe dissuaded from presenting their candida- cies, withdraw early from service, or curtail their activities to meet the demands of their principal professional positions. 40. Som e states and a small group of non-govern- mental donors earmark their contributions to OHCHR for certain purposes or mandates, thereby limiting OHCHR's flexibility in al-locating funds according to need. According to the OHCHR Annual Report, 11 states al-locate funds directly to support the Subpro-gram for Human Rights Thematic Fact-Find-ing Procedures. 75 OHCHR was unwilling to disclose exactly how and to which mandates these states earmark their funds. Earmark-ing funds directly to a mandate holder has obvious benefits for the recipient but raises difficult problems regarding equity across the range of different mandates. The lack of transparency about funding sources and allocations also raises questions about who is supporting which mandates and what, if any, influence they have on their work. 41. Ano ther challenge faced by mandate holders and OHCHR is the growing number of new thematic mandates, joint field missions and ad hoc fact-finding panels established by the HRC but with no funding. These unfunded man-dates increasingly compete with existing man-dates for scarce financial and time resources. 42. Alt hough mandates have different needs to be effective, some mandate holders with access to or experience with external donors are able to raise additional resources from such do-nors (generally from the North and West) or leverage resources from their home institu-tions to meet these needs; other rapporteurs may not have the same possibilities, raising questions regarding equity and effectiveness. There is a lack of transparency regarding such extra-UN system resources, even among the relevant OHCHR staff, raising concerns of accountability. JoINT ACTIVITIES ANd Coo RdINATI oN AMoNG SPECIAL PRoCEdURES 43. Special Procedures mandate holders are in-cre asing coordination among themselves as demonstrated by the steady rise of joint let-ters of allegation, urgent appeals and press re-leases, and even joint country visits. 76 Prior to 2008, barely half of all communications were sent jointly by two or more mandate hold-ers. In 2008 and 2009, joint communications made up 66% of all communications. 77 Of communications studied for this report sent from 2004 to 2008, joint communications made up nearly 73% of the volume. The only mandate holder that sent more than 50% of communications individually was the Spe-cial Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion, who over the five-year period sent 52% of commu-nications alone. Differently than OHCHR's count, our figures show that joint communi-cations have remained at a steady 70% since 2004 with a spike to 83% in 2009. 78 75 OHCHR Annual Report 2009, p. 196. The 11 states are Spain, Norway, Germany, United Kingdom, Canada, Finland, Ireland, Russian Fe deration, Belgium, Japan, and Austria. 76 Since 2006, there have been four joint visits to states in three regions. Before 2006, the only joint visit recorded was to East Timor by the SR o n Executions, Torture, and Violence Against Women. In 2006, the SRSG on IPDPs, the SR on Housing, and the SR on Health visited Israel and Lebanon. In 2006 the Special Procedures on Racism and Minority Issues visited the Dominican Republic. In 2008, the Special Procedures on Violence against Women and Torture visited the Republic of Moldova, and in 2009 the Special Procedures on Water and Extreme Poverty visited Bangladesh. For a full list of country visits conducted by Special Procedures, see: <http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/countryvisitsa-e.htm>. 77 Facts and Figures 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009. 78 When analyzing joint communications sent from 2004-2008, the research team counted the total number of communications recorded by special pr ocedures in their annual communications documents, irrespective of whether or not the joint communication appeared in more than one report. 33CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rights 44. In this work they are facilitated by the OH CHR's maintenance of a Quick Response Desk which centralizes incoming information to the mandate holders and processes com-munications sent. This enhanced coordinated action appears to have the effect of improving efficiency and facilitating joint action among rapporteurs. It also has the effect of increasing the attention paid by national governments and other actors to the problems raised in the communications. For instance, communica-tions sent jointly have a lower rate of no or immaterial responses (58%) than communi-cations sent by one mandate holder alone in these same categories (63%). The quality of responses by states that do reply, however, does not seem to relate to whether the com-munication was sent jointly. If anything, communications sent by one Special Proce-dure alone have a slightly better track record of garnering a positive state response than joint communications. 79 45. Regul ar communications among the Special Procedures, highlighted by the annual meet-ing of the Special Procedures, are an effec-tive way to exchange lessons learned, tackle common challenges and raise professional standards. The need for greater coordination among the Special Procedures was one of the 3,149 50%483 8% Communications Score Breakdown (2004-2008)Individual Communications Score Breakdown (2004-2008) 79 Of all responses to joint communications, 17% were scored in the Responsive but Incomplete and Steps Taken categories while 21% of solo comm unications were in these categories.

The Committee's main function is to facilitate co-ordination among the rapporteurs and to act as a bridge between them and the OHCHR, the broader U.N. human rights system, and civil society. 80 The Committee played a criti- cal role in forging common positions during the UNGA debate on creation of the HRC and in the negotiations of the institution-building package and had a direct impact in removing the most onerous provisions of the draft Code of Conduct in 2007. 46. In an a ttempt to formalize and manage com- plaints by some states of SPs violating the Code of Conduct, the Committee created an Internal Advisory Procedure to Review Prac-tices and Working Methods in June 2008. A tool for self-regulation, the procedure al-lows the body to examine information about a mandate holder's conduct confidentially and to determine what further guidance or corrective action should be taken. Informa-tion is then submitted to the President of the Council. 81 Despite the valuable role played by the Coordination Committee in this and other aspects, and that it was recognized by the Council in a 2008 presidential statement, some states claim it lacks legal standing and, therefore, do not grant it the recognition it deserves. CodE oF CoNdUCT 47. Special Procedures are challenged by growing an d at times hostile demands from member states for improving their working methods. Persistent objections to the way in which the SPs exercise their independence led in 2007 to a Code of Conduct for Special Procedures sponsored by the Africa Group and adopted as part of the Human Rights Council's institu-tion building package. The Code of Conduct serves as a way to supervise and regulate the rapporteurs but contains no procedure for handling specific allegations. Instead, com-plaints tend to get aired during interactive dialogues with SPs or in other venues. 48. While some experts consider the Code of Con- duct a useful step toward greater professional-ization of the Special Procedures, others say it has had a chilling effect on their ability (and of OHCHR staff) to speak out clearly against violations. This problem appears to have worsened due to recent incidents of member states' hostile attacks against certain mandate holders for allegedly stepping outside their mandates, a tactic some states use to avoid responding to the substance of the concerns raised by the Special Procedures. Avenues to address complaints by states, like the Internal Advisory Procedure to Review Practices and Working Methods managed by the SP Coor - dination Committee, are generally ignored in favor of using the bully pulpit of Council sessions when mandate holders only have five minutes to reply to all state commentary. TRAINING 49. Mandate holders, upon assuming their po-sit ions, receive basic orientation and train- ing in Geneva on the administrative, media relations and support structure provided by OHCHR.

Sta rting in the fall of 2009, the SP Coordi- nation Committee, with the assistance of OHCHR, began offering an induction pro-gram for new mandate holders that includes a session to hear lessons learned from cur - rent or former SPs. Y et no written materials exist on the political and diplomatic tools of the trade as learned by seasoned practitio-ners in the system. This means that mandate holders appointed out of cycle and unable to attend the annual training miss out on this important opportunity. Surprisingly, many outgoing rapporteurs do not sit down pri-vately with their successors to share the les-sons learned from their term in office, either for lack of time and resources or personal inclination to avoid encumbering the new rapporteur with past practice, or vice versa. Further compounding the uneven transition between mandate holders, OHCHR staff are routinely rotated in and out of assignments, undermining continuity and institutional memory. UNIVERSAL PERIodIC REVIEW 51. When creating the new Human Rights Coun-cil , the General Assembly decided to establish the Universal Periodic Review, to review ev-ery state once every four years on its record of adherence to internationally recognized human rights \"based on objective and reli-able information. \" Designed as a cooperative, state-driven process based on peer-to-peer in-teractive dialogue, the review results in a set of recommendations addressed to the state under review which may or may not accept them. 52. The UPR p rocess, according to a range of in- terlocutors at the national and international level, has been a net positive for the cause of promoting human rights. In its first three years, it has achieved something no other part of the U.N. human rights system has achieved: 100 percent participation of mem-ber states. It has elevated the subject of hu-man rights on the agenda of national govern-ments with most delegations coming well-prepared substantively after inter-ministerial deliberations; some are led by cabinet-level delegations composed of officials from a range of ministries. Civil society represen-tatives are invited to engage in the process through both written submissions, available publicly on the OHCHR website, and in the final session in which the report is adopted; some states have actively reached out to do-mestic groups for input to their official re-ports and in many cases domestic and inter - national NGOs have used the sessions as an advocacy and education tool for their cam-paigns. Proceedings are webcast live, allow-ing unprecedented global access to official Geneva. On the negative side, some states have manipulated the process to ensure that only soft questions or even praise are offered. NGOs are not permitted to make their case in person during the UPR review session and many struggle to find funding for additional travel to Geneva to advocate in person with delegations and before the full Council. Of even greater concern, the quality of recom-mendations range widely with some falling below the standards of international law as articulated by treaty bodies. 53. While t he Special Procedures have no formal role in the review process, their recommen-dations are consulted and reflected in the of-ficial public documents prepared by OHCHR for each country under review. UPR thus offers the only institutionalized system of 36CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rights follow-up to the rapporteurs' country-specific recommendations. It allows a formal oppor - tunity for their recommendations to be raised if a member state chooses to do so during the proceedings. Even before the review takes place, some states feel pressure to improve their records by, for example, accepting visit requests from Special Procedures or ratifying or removing reservations from human rights treaties; others accept such recommendations in the course of the review. 54. Durin g the review itself, states have peti- tioned other states to improve cooperation with Special Procedures and in many cases such requests have been accepted. Based on a review of UPR recommendations proffered through December 2009, member states have made such requests 263 times. Of these, 106 recommendations were accepted, while 50 were rejected with the remaining receiving imprecise or no response. Not surprisingly, the states making SP-related recommenda-tions tended to be those with better records of cooperation with SPs (WEOG, EEG and GRULAC groups), while those receiving such recommendations were from Asia and Afri-ca, regions which show a much weaker record of cooperation with SPs. RELATI oNS WITH TREATY Bod IES 55. While governments are strongly encouraged to co operate with Special Procedures, mem- ber states that ratify international human rights treaties are under a specific obliga-tion to comply with their provisions. Despite this, treaty bodies suffer similar challenges regarding low levels of state cooperation. For instance, in 2009, the Human Rights 170 45%43 11% 29 8% Special Procedures Received during UPR (2008-2009)Recommendations on Made during UPR (2008-2009) Africa WEoG EEG GRULAC Asia37CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human RightsCommittee reported that 50 states, of the 164 that have ratified the ICCPR, were five or more years overdue in reporting to the Com-mittee. 82 Moreover, of the more than 500 cas- es being monitored by the Committee, only 67 have received satisfactory responses from member states. Satisfactory is defined as \"the willingness of the State party to implement the Committee's recommendations or to offer the complainant appropriate remedy. \" 83 56. Bec ause the two mechanisms serve comple- mentary functions aimed toward the same goal\u2014improving a state's respect for interna-tionally recognized human rights\u2014they are increasingly finding ways to work together. 84 The Human Rights Committee, for example, which reviews state compliance with the In-ternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, regularly consults relevant SP reports and recommendations when considering a state report. The respective chairs of the treaty bodies now meet at least annually with the SP Coordination Committee to compare notes and find ways to strengthen collaboration. In the infrequent instance that treaty bodies conduct country visits, there is evidence that coordination and collaboration with relevant rapporteurs occur. 85 For example, in 2003, the Committee on Elimination of Discrimi-nation against Women visited Mexico to con-duct an inquiry under its optional protocol. According to the report of the committee, work of the Special Procedures on extrajudi-cial, summary or arbitrary executions and on the independence of judges and lawyers was considered during the examination period that led to the committee's decision to make a visit. 86 Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women conducted a visit to Mexico two years later, citing the commit-tee's work several times in her mission re-port. 87 This complementary behavior typifies Sir Nigel Rodley's observation that \"since nei-ther mechanism has the resources that would make follow-up visits practicable, the Special Rapporteur's visit was able to serve as a de facto follow-up to the Committee's visit. \" 88 82 Report of the Human Rights Committee, U.N.

The selection process for Special Procedures, whi le improved, still suffers from a lack of transparency, politicization and apparent back-room deals in which experts do not al-ways appear well-matched to their mandates. The June 2010 episode in which states like Algeria and India demanded their candidates receive certain mandates and the President of the HRC modified his final list of nominees per demands from the Africa Group and OIC further degraded a process that should empha-size expertise, independence and objectivity as the main criteria for selection. a. The Co uncil and the OHCHR should im- prove the selection process by reaching out early and often to a wide network of relevant stakeholders, advertising vacan-cies publicly, setting clear deadlines for ap-plications and providing more information about each candidate to help states and civil society assess qualifications, experience and suitability for particular mandates. b. Civi l society has a special role to play in identifying qualified candidates with a proven track record of expertise in promot-ing and defending human rights and should more proactively recruit, nominate and support top candidates. c. Qua lified candidates with a diverse life ex- perience, including practical knowledge of politics, communications and diplomacy, should be actively recruited. CoUNTRY VISITS ANd Co MMUNICATI oNS 2. While there are several positive examples of pr ogress in the implementation of internation- al human rights norms as a result of the work of the Special Procedures, the mechanism is severely challenged by member states' failure to fulfill their obligations to cooperate with the Council and its mechanisms. An endur - ing resistance to or rejection of perceived in-tervention in internal affairs, expressed mainly by states seeking to avoid scrutiny, remains a major obstacle. In other cases, a lack of dip-lomatic resources allocated to reporting and follow-up is a problem. a. All states should cooperate with the Council by issuing standing invitations for country visits by all Special Procedures, responding promptly (within three months) to requests for such visits, agreeing to the dates of a vis-it within one year of a request, accepting the The following recommendations for strengthening the Special Procedures were endorsed by the Experts Working Group listed on page vii.39CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightsstandard terms of reference for such visits, and cooperating fully during the visits. b. OHCHR s hould maintain a public list of countries that fail to implement standing invitations they have issued in accordance with the criteria above and remove those states that reject or do not effectively hon-or their standing invitation commitments from the list. 89 c. Likewise, member states should fulfill their res ponsibilities to respond to all SP com- munications in a timely and complete man-ner setting forth steps taken to address vio-lations or providing explanations for failing to do so. In the case of urgent appeals, states should respond substantively to the allega-tion within 30 days. For other allegations, states should respond substantively within two months. d. The HRC S ecretariat should regularly pub- lish data on each state's record of respond-ing to SP communications and reports, the quality of the state's response (as a few rap-porteurs do now), and more details on the status of requests to visit. Civil society and states should use such data to evaluate can-didates for election to the Human Rights Council, keeping in mind the General As-sembly's directive that all members \"shall fully cooperate with the Council. \" e. Sta tes should use a government's record of cooperation with the Council's mechanisms, including its responsiveness to SP commu-nications and requests for country visits, as criteria for election and re-election of any candidate for membership on the Human Rights Council. Any candidate running for a seat on the Council should demonstrate their qualifications by implementing the above guidelines as a matter of policy and practice. 3. Sta tes with positive records of cooperation with the Council's mechanisms should be priority candidates for technical assistance and other resources from the U.N. system and donors to help them address specific human rights con-cerns. Similarly, states with a record of persis-tent lack of cooperation should be brought to the attention of the full Human Rights Coun-cil for further discussion. Such lack of coop-eration should be critically considered when states elect members to a seat on the HRC as well as during their UPR review. 4. When s electing which states to visit, Special Procedures, with the assistance of OHCHR, should consider how to maximize the effec-tiveness of their visit by reviewing the seven factors set forth in paragraph 22 above, par - ticularly the questions of timing, civil society participation, independent media and U.N. country team contributions. It is critical that they make proper preparations for their visit by contacting a wide range of stakeholders in the country concerned in advance of their visit. A questionnaire sent in advance of the visit to key actors would help illuminate the most pressing issues, identify the most relevant parties for direct interviews and educate the mandate holder on the political context. They should endeavor to complete their report in a timely fashion and keep relevant stakeholders informed and engaged through wide dissemi-nation of the report in the country of concern. 89 Human Rights Watch has suggested distinguishing between the usage of the term \"effective\" and \"ineffective\" standing invitations rather th an grouping together all states that have issued standing invitations. For a standing invitation to be considered effective, the government making the invitation should respond to requests for visits by special procedures within six months and should actually schedule the visit within two years. For full explanation and text see: Human Rights Watch, Curing the Selectivity Syndrome: The 2011 Review of the Human Rights Council, June 2010, p. 18.40CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rights 5. States should agree to improve the quality of t he interactive dialogue with Special Pro- cedures, including by allotting more time to each individual mandate-holder for presenta-tion of his or her report, holding a separate dialogue on each country mission report, and inviting the NHRI of the relevant country to speak after the country concerned. 6. The HRC S ecretariat should maintain a public database, continuously updated and search-able by country and mandate, where all in-formation about communications and state responses can be found. This is particularly important to victims who are rarely informed of the status of the complaints they submit to the SPs. In addition, the SP's annual report to the Council should include the status of that year's new communications and outstanding ones, as the Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances does. Similarly, any individual alleging a human rights viola-tion should receive a reply from the relevant rapporteur(s)or their staff acknowledging re-ceipt and indicating what the process for con-sideration entails. 7. OHCHR should task Special Procedures, country teams, and itself with tallying how many requests for communications it receives on an ongoing basis in order to determine what percentage of complaints is acted upon or considered lacking in sufficient detail or credibility. 8. Public ations of SP communications, reports and government responses should be avail-able in the main languages of the country concerned. FoLLoW-UP PRoCEdURES 9. Given the significant investment of resources dev oted to country visits, and the important contribution they can make toward advanc-ing human rights at the national level, the absence of any systematic mechanism to follow-up on such visits is glaring. The UPR process offers at least one avenue to recall the recommendations made by the SP but the schedule of reviews only once every four years is entirely insufficient for proper fol-low-up. Similarly, treaty bodies can do more to consult and build upon SP recommenda-tions. 10. Sta tes, OHCHR, other elements of the U.N. system, SPs, national human rights institu-tions and civil society can take a number of actions to address this deficit: a. One ye ar after a country visit, SPs should write to the state concerned to raise rel-evant issues regarding progress to date on the recommendations and request a progress report within three months to be submitted to the Council as part of the SP's regular reporting. b. Out going SPs and their staff should be required to brief incoming SPs on the sta-tus of pending and recent visits and com-munications as well as concrete ideas for follow-up. c. SPs a nd their staff should prioritize follow- up visits to selected states within a 2-3 year period of the previous visit. d. The U.N. C ountry Team, OHCHR staff in the field, UNHCR personnel and other relevant actors should facilitate follow-up activities, incorporate the SP's recommen-dations into their workplans and regularly report back directly to the High Commis-sioner for Human Rights and the relevant Special Procedure on progress toward ful-filling recommendations. 41CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightse. Human rights and humanitarian NGOs sh ould work together to follow up on an SP's visit by monitoring state compliance with recommendations, carrying out ad-vocacy campaigns to press for reforms and keeping SPs regularly informed of prob-lems and progress. RESoURCES 11. To address the chronic under-funding of the Sp ecial Procedures, expand flexibility and re- duce inequities, member states in partnership with OHCHR should: a. Incr ease funding so that each mandate holder is able to visit at least three coun-tries each year and has at least two full-time professional OHCHR staff dedicated to their mandate. b. Con tinue to reduce earmarking of contri- butions to specific mandates and increase voluntary contributions to the general ac-count for Special Procedures as a way to rebalance the distribution of resources across all mandates. c. Adj ust allocation of resources in such a way that guarantees a minimum floor of funding for each mandate while provid-ing additional resources for mandates that are particularly time- and labor-intensive due to such factors as volume of commu-nications received, follow-up visits and the emergency nature of violations. d. Crea te a dedicated fund where Special Procedures can apply for added resources for special projects like elaborating stan-dards, conducting trainings, organizing workshops, etc. e. Open a n ew trust fund account for Spe- cial Procedures as an additional option for public and private donors that seek to contribute to the pool of funds available to all mandates. Individual mandate holders would still be free to fundraise indepen-dently. 12. Man date holders should receive an annual research honoraria or stipend to compensate them for mandate-related research expenses incurred in the course of preparing country visits, thematic and country reports and fol-low-up communications with stakeholders. Such funds could be spent at the discretion of the expert to support research staff in their home institutions, organize and attend the-matic seminars or undertake follow-up ac-tivities at the national or regional level. 13. Oth er U.N. agencies who work on similar is- sues to particular mandates should expend resources to support the work of the Special Rapporteurs through direct financial support to their mandates, assignment of specialized staff, in-country assistance and funding for follow-up activities. 14. Man date holders able to raise additional re- sources from sources outside the U.N. budget for the effective fulfillment of their mandate should find ways to share this information more widely. TRAINING 15. To support further professionalization and gr eater effectiveness of the Special Proce- dures, it is essential that they receive addi-tional training and guidance before carrying out their duties. This should include special instruction from experienced mandate hold-ers who have invaluable experience handling politically sensitive missions. A panel of for - mer mandate holders could be charged by the Coordination Committee to prepare written 42CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightsmaterials on the history and lessons learned of their work with a focus on the diplomatic, political, fundraising and communication skills needed to maximize effectiveness on the ground. CodE oF CoNdUCT 16. Both member states and Special Procedures sh are a set of obligations toward each other and the U.N. system for it to work effectively on behalf of victims. These include a faith-ful adherence by member states to the Code of Conduct, including every state's duty to fully cooperate with the Special Procedures, respect their independence and provide all information requested in a timely manner. States should refrain from using the Code of Conduct to block scrutiny of their human rights records or to harass and intimidate the mandate holders and should criticize such at-tacks when they occur. 17. If a state wishes to allege a violation of the Code of Conduct, it should follow the In-ternal Advisory Procedure to Review Prac-tices and Working Methods adopted in June 2008 by the Special Procedures Coordination Committee. The Coordination Committee should, in turn, be more transparent with the President of the Council and with states on steps taken to address concerns regarding in-dividual expert's behavior on mission. In this way, all parties involved will have more con-fidence in the Special Procedures' own rules for self-regulating their activities. 18. The Pr esident of the Council should also be more pro-active in explicitly recogniz-ing the legal and professional standing of the Coordination Committee and support regular consultations between the Commit-tee and member states. The President should also take the initiative to re-direct Council discussion of an SP's conduct to the Coordi-nation Committee as early as possible. The High Commissioner's Office or a small group of former mandate holders appointed by the Coordination Committee could also be in-volved as observers to the Committee's delib-erations. Proposals to create a formal \"ethics committee\" or panel of jurists to handle com-plaints of SP's behavior should be rejected as a diversion that would unreasonably oc-cupy the SPs' limited time in a series of po-tentially harassing, frivolous and politicized complaint procedures and would undermine rather than strengthen the SPs as a body of professional, independent U.N. experts. RELATI oNS WITH UPR, T REATY Bod IES ANd oTHER U.N. H UMAN RIGHTS ANd HUMANITARIAN ACToRS 19. The Special Procedures operate within a larg-er int ernational system for promoting and protecting human rights. Much more could be done to integrate them further into this framework to maximize effectiveness of their mandates. 20. Regar ding UPR, country-specific mandate holders should be called upon at all stages of the relevant country review as subject mat-ter experts. Thematic mandate holders could also be asked to participate in reviews of countries they have recently visited. SP rec-ommendations should continue to be refined to ensure actionable steps are identified for the UPR review, as set forth in the Manual of Procedures. SP visits to states could be timed to take place within a year of a country's up-coming review to maximize attention to re-sulting recommendations. 21. Tre aty bodies should adopt the practice fol- lowed by the Human Rights Committee of regularly consulting all relevant SP reports 43CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightsfor states under review and raising their rec- ommendations in the course of the review. 22. The Se cretary General should require U.N. Country Teams to incorporate SP recom-mendations into their annual workplans and to appoint a focal point in each country team responsible for followup monitoring and re-porting on state actions to address such rec-ommendations. A similar effort should be addressed toward mainstreaming SP recom-mendations into activities of U.N. peacekeep-ing missions. 23. OHCHR s hould spearhead coordination with specialized U.N. voluntary funds to connect SP recommendations to funding priorities. This is beginning to happen in an ad hoc way. For example, the Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery has cooper -ated with the Special Rapporteur on the same subject on four project grants to grassroots Haitian NGOs to combat child labor and pro-vide assistance to child domestic workers and their families. 90 Similarly, the U.N. Voluntary Funds for Victims of Torture, for Indigenous Populations, and for Violence against Women could be tapped for resources to help states im-plement SP recommendations in those areas. 24. Wit h the creation of a new Assistant Secre- tary General for Human Rights in New Y ork, the time is ripe to connect the Special Pro-cedures more directly to key U.N. bodies at U.N. headquarters, particularly the Security Council and the Third Committee. The As-sistant Secretary General should have as a top priority the mission of mainstreaming the work of the Special Procedures into the ac-tivities of relevant U.N. actors in New Y ork. 90 OHCHR 2009 Report, p. 177.44CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rights The Human Rights Council, Acting in compliance with the mandate entrusted to it by the United Nations General Assembly in resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, Having considered the draft text on institution- building submitted by the President of the Coun-cil, 1.

III, paras. 60-62.45CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rights41. Technical and objective requirements for eli- gi ble candidates for mandate-holders will be approved by the Council at its sixth session (first session of the second cycle), in order to ensure that eligible candidates are highly qualified individuals who possess established competence, relevant expertise and extensive professional experience in the field of human rights. 42. The f ollowing entities may nominate candi- dates as special procedures mandate-holders: (a) Governments; (b) Regional Groups op-erating within the United Nations human rights system; (c) international organizations or their offices (e.g. the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights); (d) non-governmental organizations; (e) other human rights bodies; (f) individual nominations. 43. The Office of t he High Commissioner for Hu- man Rights shall immediately prepare, main-tain and periodically update a public list of eligible candidates in a standardized format, which shall include personal data, areas of ex-pertise and professional experience. Upcom-ing vacancies of mandates shall be publicized. 44. The pr inciple of non-accumulation of human rights functions at a time shall be respected. 45. A man date-holder's tenure in a given func- tion, whether a thematic or country mandate, will be no longer than six years (two terms of three years for thematic mandate-holders). 46. Indi viduals holding decision-making po- sitions in Government or in any other or - ganization or entity which may give rise to a conflict of interest with the responsibilities inherent to the mandate shall be excluded. Mandate -ho lders will act in their personal capacity.47. A cons ultative group would be established to propose to the President, at least one month before the beginning of the session in which the Council would consider the selection of mandate -ho lders, a list of candidates who possess the highest qualifications for the mandates in question and meet the general criteria and particular requirements. 48. The co nsultative group shall also give due consideration to the exclusion of nominated candidates from the public list of eligible can-didates brought to its attention. 49. At th e beginning of the annual cycle of the Council, Regional Groups would be invited to appoint a member of the consultative group, who would serve in his/her personal capacity. The Group will be assisted by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. 50. The con sultative group will consider candi- dates included in the public list; however, un-der exceptional circumstances and if a partic-ular post justifies it, the Group may consider additional nominations with equal or more suitable qualifications for the post. Recom-mendations to the President shall be public and substantiated. 51 The con sultative group should take into ac- count, as appropriate, the views of stakehold-ers, including the current or outgoing man-date-holders, in determining the necessary expertise, experience, skills, and other rel-evant requirements for each mandate. 52. On the b asis of the recommendations of the consultative group and following broad con-sultations, in particular through the regional coordinators, the President of the Council will identify an appropriate candidate for each vacancy. The President will present to 46CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightsmember States and observers a list of candi- dates to be proposed at least two weeks prior to the beginning of the session in which the Council will consider the appointments. 53. If ne cessary, the President will conduct fur - ther consultations to ensure the endorsement of the proposed candidates. The appointment of the special procedures mandate-holders will be completed upon the subsequent ap-proval of the Council. Mandate-holders shall be appointed before the end of the session. B. revi ew, rationalization and improvement of mandates 54. The re view, rationalization and improve- ment of mandates, as well as the creation of new ones, must be guided by the principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity and non -se lectivity, constructive international dialogue and cooperation, with a view to en-hancing the promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, political, economic, so-cial and cultural rights, including the right to development. 55. The re view, rationalization and improvement of each mandate would take place in the con-text of the negotiations of the relevant reso-lutions. An assessment of the mandate may take place in a separate segment of the inter - active dialogue between the Council and spe-cial procedures mandate-holders. 56. The re view, rationalization and improvement of mandates would focus on the relevance, scope and contents of the mandates, having as a framework the internationally recog-nized human rights standards, the system of special procedures and General Assembly resolution 60/251.57. Any de cision to streamline, merge or possi- bly discontinue mandates should always be guided by the need for improvement of the enjoyment and protection of human rights. 58. The Co uncil should always strive for im- provements: (a) Man dates should always offer a clear prospect of an increased level of human rights protection and promotion as well as being coherent within the system of human rights; (b) Equ al attention should be paid to all human rights. The balance of thematic mandates should broadly reflect the ac-cepted equal importance of civil, politi-cal, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development; (c) Ever y effort should be made to avoid un- necessary duplication; (d) Are as which constitute thematic gaps will be identified and addressed, includ-ing by means other than the creation of special procedures mandates, such as by expanding an existing mandate, bringing a cross-cutting issue to the attention of mandate-holders or by requesting a joint action to the relevant mandate-holders; (e) Any co nsideration of merging mandates should have regard to the content and predominant functions of each mandate, as well as to the workload of individual mandate -ho lders; (f) In cre ating or reviewing mandates, ef- forts should be made to identify whether the structure of the mechanism (expert, rapporteur or working group) is the most effective in terms of increasing human rights protection; (g) New m andates should be as clear and spe- cific as possible, so as to avoid ambiguity.47CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rights59. It should be considered desirable to have a unifo rm nomenclature of mandate-holders, titles of mandates as well as a selection and appointment process, to make the whole sys-tem more understandable. 60. Thema tic mandate periods will be of three years. Country mandate periods will be of one year. 61. Man dates included in Appendix I, where ap- plicable, will be renewed until the date on which they are considered by the Council ac-cording to the programme of work. 92 62. Current mandate-holders may continue serv-ing , provided they have not exceeded the six-ye ar term limit (Appendix II). On an ex- ceptional basis, the term of those mandate-holders who have served more than six years may be extended until the relevant mandate is considered by the Council and the selection and appointment process has concluded. 63. Deci sions to create, review or discontinue country mandates should also take into ac-count the principles of cooperation and gen-uine dialogue aimed at strengthening the ca-pacity of Member States to comply with their human rights obligations. 64. In ca se of situations of violations of human rights or a lack of cooperation that require the Council's attention, the principles of ob-jectivity, non-selectivity, and the elimination of double standards and politicization should apply. 92 Country mandates meet the following criteria: There is a pending mandate of the Council to be accomplished; or There is a pending mandate of the General Assembly to be accomplished; or The nature of the mandate is for advisory services and technical assistance.48CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightsprocedures Mandate-holders of the human rights council Th e Human Rights Council, Guided by the aims and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declara-tion of Human Rights and recognizing the ensu-ing obligations inter alia of States to cooperate in promoting universal respect for human rights as enshrined therein, Recalling the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted on 25 June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights, Recalling also that in resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, entitled \"Human Rights Council\" , the General Assembly: (a) Rea ffirmed that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that all human rights must be treated in a fair and equal manner on the same footing and with the same emphasis;

Types of impact include direct intervention on behalf of victims leading to improvement in their situations, policy changes, legislative reforms, favorable judicial decisions, agenda-setting of new issues demanding national and international at - tention, and capacity building. CoUNTRY VISITS Stopping Ill Treatment of Prisoners in Cambodia After visiting two imprisoned journalists in 2009, the Special Rapporteur on Cambodia complained about and publicized poor prison conditions. He confronted senior government officials and prison administrators about the poor conditions and treatment subsequently improved. One of the prisoners' sisters confirmed the success of the mandate holder's visit to a local newspaper, de-claring that since the Special Rapporteur's visit \"the prison administration treated my brother much better by allowing him to sleep in a wider space and letting him get out of his cell five hours a d a y.\" 93 Eventually, one of the prisoners was released by a presidential pardon and had the op-portunity to thank the Special Rapporteur in per - son. In a related case of normative impact, the Special Rapporteur, building on the work of his prede-cessor, encouraged the government to eliminate criminal charges for defamation. The mandate holder directly raised this issue with the Prime Minister and his advisors and while it has not been fully resolved, the penal code was revised, in line with recommendations, so that media defa-mation would no longer result in criminal liabil-ity or imprisonment as a penalty. 94 Protecting Internally Displaced Persons in Georgia The Special Representative of the Secretary Gen- eral on the human rights of internally displaced persons has played a fundamental role in re-cent years in encouraging effective government policy approaches to Georgia's complicated and ever changing displacement problems. After the SRSG's first visit in 2000, he recommended the government design national programs and poli-cies in accordance with the U.N. Guiding Princi-ples on Internal Displacement. In 2005 his succes-sor visited again, issuing a report recommending EXAMPLES oF HoW SPECIAL PR oCEdURES VISITS AN d CoMMUNICA TIoNS AFFEC T NATI oNAL AC TIoNAPPEN dIX E 93 Ros Rada, Letter to the Editor Cambodia Daily, January 29, 2010.

Pur - suant to these recommendations, the Georgian government enacted three displacement-related normative laws in 2006 and 2007 that complied with the SRSG recommendations. The 2006 Law of Georgia on Internal Displace- ment guarantees specific rights for IDPs in accor - dance with the Guiding Principles while the 2007 Law on Property Restitution and Compensation for the Victims of Conflict in the Former South Ossetian Autonomous District in the Territory of Georgia established the legal procedures by which refugees and IDPs can seek property restitution and compensation. 95 In addition, the Georgian government adopted Decree #47 of 2007 on Ap-proving the State Strategy for Internally Displaced Persons which recognized the Guiding Principles as the conceptual framework for Georgia's IDP policy and laid out the strategy for the return of the internally displaced, decent living conditions for the displaced population, and their participa-tion in society. 96 Following the August 2008 con- flict in South Ossetia and subsequent hostilities in Abkhazia that led to thousands of additional displacements, the SRSG conducted an official mission in October 2008 and another follow up visit in November 2009 to study the impact of the conflict. The SRSG continued to encourage the implementation of the national action plan that has since been updated and revised to reflect new challenges per his advice. 97Promoting Right to Health in Peru The Special Rapporteur on health visited Peru in 2004, formulating recommendations in health policy, sexual and reproductive rights, and mental health among other issues. Nearly a year after the visit, the country reported on its progress and ex-plained actions taken to address the mandate hold-er's recommendations. The government launched a national campaign four months after the Spe-cial Rapporteur's field mission to comply with his primary recommendation that \"government, in cooperation with stakeholders, formulate a com - prehensive health policy and strategy, underpinned by the right to health (in short, a 'pro-poor equity-based health policy'). \" 98 The government campaign, known as Carta de Salud, allowed members of the public to contribute to and comment on govern-ment health policy. More than 60,000 responses were collected\u2014with special attention given to il-literate and/or Qechua-speaking citizens. 99 Responding to the mandate holder's recommen-dation on sexual and reproductive rights, the government launched national health strategies aimed at enhanced treatment and education in these areas. Per the Special Rapporteur's recom-mendation on providing comprehensive sexual and reproductive health information and services to young people, 100 the government systematically incorporated the subject into the curriculum of more than 3,000 primary and secondary schools in 34 regions. 101 95 Brookings-Bern Project on Internal Displacement, National and Regional Laws and Policies on Internal Displacement: Georgia.

Monitoring Violence against Indigenous Women in Canada After visiting Canada in 2004, the Special Rap- porteur on violence against women revealed high rates of violence experienced by indigenous women. Approximately 500 Aboriginal women had been murdered or reported missing over a 15-year period, and Aboriginal women were five times more likely to experience a violent death than other Canadian women. 104 The mandate holder recommended that \"particular attention be paid by specialized institutions to the abuse and violence of Aboriginal women and girls, par - ticularly in the urban environment. \" 105 In March 2005, the government signed a five-year contri-bution agreement with an indigenous rights or - ganization to run the \"Sisters in Spirit\" program, aimed at addressing violence, particularly ra-cialized and/or sexualized violence, against Ab-original women through awareness-raising and practical-oriented research, aimed at gaining a better understanding of this phenomenon. 106 Treating Maternal Mortality as a Human Rights Issue Implementation at the state level is not the only way to measure the effectiveness of Special Pro-cedures. During his tenure as a mandate holder, the Special Rapporteur on health focused consis-tently on maternal mortality as a human rights issue. It was the focus of his 2006 report to the General Assembly; the theme of his 2007 country visit to India and a supplementary note attached to the report; the topic of his March 2007 state-ment to the Council; the topic of a side panel to an HRC session in 2008; and the topic of a paper authored by him in 2007 for UNFPA. At the June 2009 session of the HRC, member states endorsed a resolution that recognized preventable maternal mortality as a human rights issue and tasked the OHCHR with investigating the topic. Promoting Gender Equity in the Judiciary in the Maldives After visiting the Maldives in 2007, the Special Rapporteur for the independence of judges and lawyers voiced concern that there was not one sin-gle female judge in the country\u2014an issue that had been formally recognized by the Attorney Gen-eral's office dating back to 2004. 107 Less than two months after presenting his recommendations, the Maldives announced the first appointment of female judges in the country's history. 108 102 E/CN.4/2005/51/Add.3, p. 21, para 76. 103 E/CN.4/2005/G/32, p. 4, #2. 104 Rodolfo Stavenhagen, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, Mi ssion to Canada, December 2, 2004, para 56.

Furthermore the mandate holder recommended that solicitors be present during police interrogations. According to gov-ernment officials in the United Kingdom, police intimidation of defense layers nearly ceased after both measures were implemented in 1998. Tackling Violence against Women in IndonesiaIn some cases, it takes years for a mandate holder's recommendation to come to fruition. In 1998, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women visited Indonesia in the aftermath of violent sexu-al attacks against Chinese women in major cities. According to one NGO representative, civil soci-ety used the Special Rapporteur's report as a lob-bying tool to press government and parliament to enact new measures on domestic violence and to help shape their agenda, including a presiden-tial decree creating the National Commission on Violence Against Women (Komnas Perampuan). After many years of campaigning, Indonesian leg-islators in 2006 passed a victim and witness pro-tection law, a step recommended by the mandate holder following her visit. Improving Prison Conditions in UruguayIn Uruguay, the Special Rapporteur on torture's visit in March 2009 made a difference even before the report was made public. The govern-ment took immediate action to address the Spe-cial Rapporteur's discovery that in some prisons \"detainees are held in deplorable conditions as well, with overcrowded cells lacking appropri-ate sanitation and places to sleep. \" 109 Only three weeks after his visit the government enacted a plan, at the request of the president and minister of interior, to alleviate overcrowding. More than 1,200 detainees were transferred to new facilities with special arrangements for those with psychi-atric illnesses, drug addictions, and women with children. 110 Addressing Neglected Diseases in Uganda The Special Rapporteur on health visited Uganda in collaboration with the World Health Orga-nization in 2005 to focus on neglected tropical diseases\u2014ailments that affect nearly one billion impoverished persons annually. Following the visit, the Special Rapporteur recommended that the Uganda Human Rights Commission (UHCR) \"establish a right-to-health unit that is responsible for monitoring those policies, programs and proj-ects relating to neglected diseases. For example, relying on existing data, the unit should track the incidence of neglected diseases and the initiatives taken to address them. \" 111 In response to the recommendation, the Com-mission created a new unit in 2006 tasked exclu-sively with focusing on neglected tropical dis-eases. Key functions of the unit include monitor - ing government policies, programs and activities and sensitizing health workers and policy-mak-ers to a rights-based approach to health care. 112 109 U.N.

Combating Torture in JordanAfter visiting Jordan in 2006, the Special Rap- porteur on torture issued conclusions and recom-mendations that were challenged by the govern-ment. 113 Despite the opposition to some of the findings, the government took several steps to address recommendations. The mandate holder concluded that there existed an implicit social tolerance for torture and recom-mended that the highest authorities, particularly those responsible for law enforcement, declare that torture would not be tolerated and would be punishable by a prison sentence. According to non-governmental sources, the Public Secu-rity Directorate (PSD) officials reported that King Abdullah and the Director of PSD issued clear in-structions that there was to be no torture. These declarations were not made public. NGO sources further confirmed to the Special Rapporteur that the General Intelligence Directorate (GID) issued written and oral instructions to all personnel to refrain from abusing any detainee physically, ver - bally or emotionally, and providing an increase in penalties for violations. 114 The Special Rapporteur also recommended that the government establish an effective and independent complaints system for victims of torture and abuse. NGO sources confirmed several steps taken by the government to ensure a complaints mechanism: the PSD estab-lished a radio station through which complaints are aired; the PSD installed sealed complaints boxes in their Human Rights Offices; PSD's Le-gal Affairs prosecutors were made available at all times in seven prisons to receive complaints; the PSD and the National Center for Human Rights (NCHR) set up hotlines to receive complaints; and the Office of the Ombudsman was founded in February 2009. 115 Developing Anti-Torture Policies in Georgia After the Special Rapporteur on torture visited Georgia in 2005, the government began to imple-ment recommendations even before the pub-lication of the official report. The government amended the criminal code to bring the definition of torture in line with international standards, ac-ceded to the Optional Protocol of the Convention Against Torture, (OPCAT) and recognized CAT's competence to consider individual complaints\u2014all in compliance with the Special Rapporteur's preliminary findings. 116 The government also quickly implemented many of the Special Rap-porteur's other recommendations: it developed and adopted a new anti-torture action plan; be-gan refurbishing prisons to remedy overcrowding and made the necessary budgetary allocations for future repairs; transferred thousands of prisoners from overcrowded facilities; and began to sepa-rate pre-trial detainees from convicted prisoners with more consistency. 117 Protecting Freedom of Expression in the Maldives After visiting in March 2009, the Special Rappor - teur on freedom of expression recommended that 113 Note verbale dated from the Permanent Mission of Jordan to the United Nations Office at Geneva addressed to the Office of the High Co mmissioner for Human Rights, 22 March 2006, p. 2. 114 Manfred Nowak, Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment: Follow-up to r ecommendations, February 18, 2008, paras 238-295.

In addition, Congress passed the Law on National Languages, which officially recog-nized the Mayan, Garifuna and Xinka languages and promotes their preservation and use. 121 Fostering the Rule of Law in Indigenous Com-munities in Mexico After visiting Mexico in 2003, the Special Rappor - teur on indigenous peoples recommended that the government should incorporate indigenous law into the judicial system. 122 Subsequently, the government established \"indigenous courts\" or \"peace Quintana Roo and San Luis Potos\u00ed, comprised of members of local in-digenous communities, with power to hear civil and family cases, as well as minor criminal cases, on the basis of indigenous law and custom. The National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (CDI) also conducted studies on indigenous law and its compatibility with hu-man rights norms and national legislation. 123 GoVERNMENT RESPoNSES To Co MMUNICA TIoNS pakis tan: The case of Ayub Masih, a Pakistani Christian sentenced to death under Pakistan's harsh blasphemy law, was taken up by the Work-ing Group on Arbitrary Detention which issued an opinion in November 2001 finding that his de-tention was arbitrary and in violation of Articles 9 and 10 of the UDHR. The Working Group called on the government either to retry Masih or par - don him. Freedom Now, an NGO that supported Masih's complaint, used the WGAD opinion to persuade members of the U.S. Senate to issue a letter to President Pervez Musharraf to pardon him. In response, the government accelerated the case review in the Supreme Court of Pakistan which found violations of due process, acquitted Masih of all charges and ordered his immediate release. 124 Vietnam: Dr. Nguyen Dan Que, a democracy ac- tivist in Vietnam for many decades, was arrested in March 2003 after criticizing the government's slow pace of political reform. Freedom Now, on his behalf, filed two petitions to the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention alleging Dr. Que's 118 Frank La Rue, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Mission to the Maldives, May 25, 2009, p. 16, p ara 59.

Freedom Now relied on this opinion to intensify a political and media campaign demand-ing his release. The combination of these elements led Vietnam to release him in February 2005. 125 Bahrain: A series of three joint communication issued on January 10, January 18, and February 20, 2008 by the Special Rapporteurs on the situ-ation of human rights defenders; on torture and other cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment or punishment; on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; on the freedom of religion or belief; on extraju-dicial, summary or arbitrary executions; and the Working Group on arbitrary detention called on the government of Bahrain to release Mr. May-tham Bader Jassim Al-Sheikh from prison. Mr. Al-Sheikh was detained during a wave of arrests between 21 and 28 December 2007, which tar - geted more than 60 activists, including several human rights defenders, and had been sentenced to five years in prison. His appeal of this convic-tion was denied on 28 December 2008. On 3 April 2009, Jassim Al-Sheikh was released from Jaw Prison by royal decree, due to the deterioration of his health condition. 126 saudi arab ia: On May 27, 2008, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special Rapporteurs on free dom of o pinion and expres- sion; on the situation of human rights defenders; on the independence of judges and lawyers; and on torture sent an urgent appeal to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in relation to the case of a promi-nent human rights defender. On 11 January 2009, the individual was released after spending 235 days in solitary confinement in prison. 127 united kingdom: In the report on her coun- tr y visit to the United King dom (A/HRC/7/10/ A dd.3), the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief expressed concerns at the con-tinued existence of the common law offence of blasphemy. She concluded that the offence is dis-criminatory because it favors Christianity alone and lacks a mechanism to take account of the proper balance with freedom of ex pres sion. She recommended that the government de crimina lize blasphemy as an insult to a religion and to fully implement the protection of individuals against incitement to racial or religious hatred. Subse-quently, debates in the Houses of Parliament and a report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights explicitly referred to the Special Rapporteur's rec-ommendations. Amend ments w ere introduced in the Criminal Justice and Im migrat ion Bill with a view to abolish the offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel under the common law of Eng-land and Wales. The Act received royal as sent o n 8 May 2008 and the relevant section abolishing the common law blasphemy offences came into force in July 2008. 128 afghanistan: On January 28, 2008, a joint urgent ap peal issued by the Special Rapporteurs on free- dom of opinion and expression, on freedom of religion or belief, on the independence of judges and lawyers, and the Working Group on enforced or involuntary disappearances called for the re-lease of Sayed Perwiz Kambakhsh, a young jour - nalist who was sentenced to death and then to 20 years in prison for downloading an article about the rights of women in Islam. After being held for nearly two years, the journalist was pardoned and 125 Id., pp. 138-43. 126 Special Procedures Bulletin No. 13, April-June 2009. 127 Special Procedures Bulletin No. 12, January-March 2009. 128 Special Procedures Bulletin No. 9, April-June 2008. 68CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightsreleased.

The document, entitled \"Housing the Homeless, \" con-tains 15 recommendations aimed at preventing and addressing homelessness in the country. The report cited the recommendations raised by the Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate hous-ing following his visit to Australia in 2006. 130 The Maldives: In July 2005, the Special Rap-porteurs on freedom of expression, freedom of religion or belief, and human rights defend-ers sent an urgent appeal to the government of the Maldives concerning the country's Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs banning people from possessing the Universal Declaration for Human Rights (UDHR). The government responded within a week affirming its support for the UDHR and explaining that the Council's statement was not legally binding. Moreover, the Deputy Min-ister of Foreign Affairs responded a month later to confirm the initial response and to inform the mandate holders that the government informed the Council to desist from such pronouncements without prior consultation. 131 129 Special Procedure Bulletin No. 14, July-September 2009. 130 Ibid. 131 Report of the Special on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Summary of cases transmitted to Governments and replies re ceived, March 27, 2006, pp. 176-177.

These communica-tions typically convey allegations of an ongoing or imminent human rights violation that falls within the mandate of one or more Special Procedures, who raise these allegations by letter or urgent ap-peal to the relevant government. Governments are expected to reply to the mandate holder in a timely manner with all information regarding the allegations, including, where appropriate, the steps the government has taken to address the hu-man rights violation alleged in the Special Proce-dure's communications. 132 We analyzed these gov- ernment responses to 19 current mandate hold-ers' communications (17 Special Rapporteurs and 2 Working Groups) over a five-year period (2004-2008), with the goal of deriving conclu-sions and making recommendations for strength-ening the effectiveness of Special Procedures as a mechanism for influencing state behavior and advancing human rights at the country level. Replies by governments to communications sent by UN Special Procedures vary in their timeli-ness, content and responsiveness. When analyz-ing a government's reply to a Special Procedure communication, we focused on the content of the reply as it relates to the specific human rights vio-lation alleged by the original Special Procedure communication. Government responses to Special Procedure communications were assigned one of the follow-ing five categories: No Response (NR), Immate-rial Response (IM), Violation Rejected Without Substantiation (VR), Responsive but Incomplete (RI), or Steps Taken to Address Allegations (ST). Responses that were not available due to transla-tion issues were marked with In Translation (in). A brief description of each category follows. Ex-amples are meant to expound each classification but do not serve to limit the category's applica-tion to the details contained therein. The Working Groups on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) and En-forced or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID) were assessed with the same categories but have additional classifications to accommodate their unique working methods. 133 nr - no respo nse: Government has not replied at all to the Special Procedure communication. iM - immate rial respo nse: Government replies in writing to the Special Procedure communica-tion, but the response does not contain a material METH odoLoGY FoR ANALY ZING GoVERNMENT REPLIES T o U.N.

XX76CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightsresponse to the human rights violation alleged in the communication. Inc ludes responses in which a government merely acknowledges receipt of a Special Procedure communication or otherwise provides a pro forma reply with little to no substantive information. Inc ludes responses in which a government provides irrelevant information that does not address the underlying human rights violation alleged by the Special Procedure: examp le: A government responds with additional facts about the matter or with information about human right protec-tion broadly in the state but does not ad-dress the underlying violation. V r - Violation rejec ted Without substa ntia- tion : Government replies to reject the allegation that a human rights violation occurred, but does not provide sufficient information to substantiate its denial of the allegation. Inc ludes replies in which a government cat- egorically denies the violation examp le: Government reply simply in- dicates that no such violation occurred. examp le: Government reply states that it never engages in the acts that com- prise the alleged violation. examp le: A government responds to indicate why the victim of the human rights violation merited certain treat-ment without addressing alleged human rights violation. Inc ludes replies in which a government de- nies the violation but fails to provide suf-ficient information to support its denial, or fails to provide information that indicates that an adequate investigation occurred. example : Government reply notes merely that the allegation was looked into and found to be false, without de-scribing investigation in any detail. examp le: Government reply provides some information regarding its investiga- tion, but not enough to determine wheth-er the steps taken were adequate to ad-dress the alleged human rights violation. ri - respo nsive but incom plete: Government re- ply responds to and addresses the violation alleged by the Special Procedure communication, but the reply either does not fully respond to the allegations or, for a communication referencing multiple indi-viduals or violations, the government reply responds only with regard to some. Also included are respons-es that indicate that an investigation has been or - dered or commenced but is not yet concluded. Inc ludes responses where a Special Proce- dure communication makes reference in a single communication to multiple indi-viduals whose human rights were violated, but a government reply includes responsive information for some but not all of these individuals. examp le: Special Procedure commu- nication indicates that six persons were victims of human rights violations, but the government reply only provides ad-equate information about four of these individuals and provides no or incom-plete information regarding the other two individuals. Inc ludes responses where the government reply does not completely address the violation(s) alleged in the Special Proce-dure communication. examp le: Special Procedure commu- nication states that an individual was 77CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of the U.N.'s Independent Experts on Human Rightsvictim of two violations and the govern- ment response indicates that one viola-tion was subject to adequate investiga-tion and concluded that it did or did not occur, but the response provides no information regarding the second alle-gation. Inc ludes responses where a government investigation has been ordered or com-menced but is not yet complete, and where such investigation appears to be adequate in its design. st - steps taken t o address all egations: Gov- ernment reply indicates that an adequate investiga-tion is completed, and/or that concrete steps have been taken to address and/or remedy the human rights violation. Inc ludes situations where the government explains what measures were taken to ad-dress the violation: examp le: Government undertook ad- equate investigation and concluded that violation did occur, and took steps to punish offenders and/or provide rem-edy for victim examp le: Government undertook ad- equate investigation and concluded that violation did not occur, and investiga-tion was appropriate in its scope and importance. example: Government undertook ad- eq uate investigation and concluded that violation did occur, and prosecution of wrongdoer is ongoing. Inc lude situations where government con- cludes that allegations are not well-found-ed, if the government investigation that reaches this conclusion appears adequate to give the reviewer confidence that the in-vestigation was appropriate. Inc ludes situations where the underlying human rights violation is denied by the government, but only in situations where such a denial is founded upon an adequate or complete investigation of the allegations. When determining the legitimacy of an investi-gation, researchers considered features, including but not limited to, the independence of the au-thority in charge, the date of commencement of the investigation, indication of official character, and the quality and number of documents and witnesses referenced. In select cases, government replies concurrently satisfied several category areas\u2014particularly when responding to communications involving more than one individual. Many of these cases fit in the RI category which provides space for an assorted government response while others were determined a best fit elsewhere. 78CATALYSTS FOR RIGHTS The Unique Contribution of
