The COVID -19 pandemic, social and racial inequities, and climate change have all tested our resolve over the past few years and made real the need for a collective effort to achieve a better shared future. The Smithsonian , the world's largest museum, education, and research complex, has an important role to play on behalf of the American people. It is our responsibility to repay the trust we have as keepers of some of the nation's most revered artifacts, as scholars who examine our past and present, and as scientists who address basic questions to help us underst and our world and universe. To that end, Smithsonian 2027: Our Shared Future , the five-year Strategic Plan we launched in the winter of 2022, outlin es our aspirations, priorities, and planned impact as we continue our transform ation to meet the challenges and opportunities of a rapidly changing world. It identifies five areas the Smithsonian must target to help secure a better shared future for our Institut ion, our nation, and our planet : Ensuring every home and classroom can access the Smithsonian's digital content ; Working together to build a nimble r and more effective Smithsonian ; Taking advantage of our status as a trusted source of information to explore and grapple with what it means to be American ; Harnessing the Smithsonian 's expertise to elevate science in the global discourse ; and Engaging with educational systems across the country to build and enrich a national culture of l earning . The President's FY 2024 Budget includes $1.241 billion for the Smithsonian to enable the Institution to carry out these plans and fulfill its mission to increase and diffuse knowledge. We are grateful for the robust support we receive from the American people, Congress, and the Administration . As we look to implement the Institution -wide initiatives that support our new strategic focus areas, receiving robust federal support will be more vital than ever. The following are the ways we have begun this implementation and highlight how we will actively support, evaluat e, and measur e the progress of our plans for the Smithsonian. A More Digital Smithsonian The pandemic accelerated the Smithsonian's transformation into a virtual museum complex that complements our physical spaces. Nothing replaces the authentic objects we display, but by using the digital tools at our disposal , we will ensure that our treasures still reach millions across the country and around the globe who cannot visi t us in person. For many years, we have worked to digitize our objects, specimens, archival materials, and library books to make them more accessible to the public. Our museums and libraries have created digital images for more than five million objects, specimens , and books, and electronic records for more than 33 million artifacts and items in the national 1 collections. Our Digitization Program Office has created 3D digital images for collection objects people can access, explore, and even print, such as the space shuttle Discovery or a triceratops fossil . And in February of 2020 , we launched Smithsonian Open Access, an initiative that makes more than 4.5 million digital 2D and 3D objects in our collections freely available for anyone to download, share, and reuse for any purpose. To date , people have downloaded this material millions of times, using it to explore, discover , and create their own learning resources . The Smithsonian is building digital capacity to be in every household, classroom, and community . Our new Office of Digital Transformation is prioritizing innovative and ongoing digital initiatives to reach audiences across the nation and around the world. These initiatives will allow people to experience our world -renowned scholarship, research, and collections in new and exci ting ways and will be organized around themes such as democracy, race, innovation, sustainability, and identity. By seeking out new and innovative partnerships to leverage state -of-the-art resources, we can use more groundbreaking technology and inspire new audiences worldwide. A Nimble r and More Effective Smithsonian For the next five years, the Smithsonian will increas e the nimbleness of the organization's administrative functions, both those that are managed centrally and those embedded within individual museums, research centers , and units. By building stronger connections within the Institution , we will improv e efficiency and generate more effective and integrated solutions. Equally critical is the goal of fostering an environment for staff that promotes safety, professional development, and individual accountability. We must achieve these objectives to ensure the Smit hsonian remains an employer of choice for all staff . One of the most exciting ways we are implementing the ideas and processes necessary to be more agile and responsive is through our new National Museum of the American Latino (NMAL) and the Smithsonian American Women's History Museum (SAWHM) . Not only will they integrate a digital mindset from their inception, they will apply efficient processes in design and construction, develop a comprehensive funding model to carry the Museums through the next decade, and adopt an audience -centric approach to program development that values diversity and inclusion to better serve the public . A Trusted Source for America One of the Institution's great strengths is the trust we have earned for 176 years . The Smithsonian has a unique and vital role to play in finding common ground and giving hope to the American people. Accordingly, w e have launched several initiatives to help the public grapple with the nation's bigg est challenges . For example, Our Shared Future: Reckoning with Our Racial Past , the first coordinated Smithsonian effort to explicitly address racism and racial equity, is exploring how Americans confront race, the legacy racial discrimination has left on communities, and how the way we deal with issues of race will shape our nation 's future. It has begun to explore and expand the conversation about the historic roots of contemporary movements in social justice. It is also providing a collaborative space for 2 dialogue about race and help s advance the work of others by offering live and digital resources and experiences to local communities throughout the country. Another area where we can apply our status as a trusted source is in the stewardship of our c ollections . By work ing closely with the communities of our collections ' origin s to evaluate these objects , we will develop stewardship practices to preserv e and sustain them for future generations. We recently initiated the Institution -wide Shared Stewardship and Ethical Returns Policy to return collections or share stewardship of objects if we find them to have been unethically obtained. More just, ethical, and inclusive man agement practices like these will foster goodwill with different constituencies and help make our collections and archives more accessible while also adding context to the stories they tell . We will also use our upcoming rural initiative to reach out to communities often overlooked in the national conversation . By explor ing current, relevant issues in rural America , we can provide resources to help them build resilience. We will expand our programming and services to collaborate with rural stakeholders in meet ing their needs and learn ing from rural and Tribal communities in the United States. Through this initiative, the Smithsonian will provide space for dialogue, prioritize diversity, ide ntify and root out bias in our collections and programs, and work to form partnerships around the country . Elevating Our Science The Smithsonian is an institution historically driven by science . Our researchers have worked on endeavors from developing the precursor to the National Weather Service to creating the first image of a black hole at the center of our galaxy . To strengthen the capacity of our scientific activities , we are d evelop ing a strategic plan for science at the Smithsonian that captures our core priorities to explore life on a sustainable planet, solve the mysteries of the universe , and center the Smithsonian in critical conversations about science. Under the umbrella of Smith sonian Science, this set of initiatives strives to expand our reach, relevance, and impact with strategic investment s in and strengthened coordination of research, collections, long -term data sets, field stations, partnerships, digital infrastructure, and communication s platforms. Through this work, we will catalyze change, action, and inclusion under three sub -initiativ es: Life on a Sustainable Planet , Solving the Mysteries of the Universe , and Communicating Science for Impact . Life on a Sustainable Planet will implement science strategies on Oceans, Environmental Justice, One Health, and Working Ecosystems. Solving the Mysteries of the Universe will focus on tipping and turning points in the evolution of the universe, galaxies, solar systems, and planets, helping us grasp our place in the universe. Communicating Science for Impact will inspire citizens of all ages to engage in scientific discovery, take advantage of science, technology, ingenuity, and culture, and contribute to a new era where people and nature can thrive in harmony . This focused and collaborative approach will allow us to research where communities and science come together, use what we find to create sustainable and effective solutions, and communicate what we learn to the public through our museums, research centers , and educational programs. We will showcase ways we lea d, collaborate , and share, expanding 3 our understanding of life on Earth and our place in the universe. And w e will emphasize the importance of partnerships, transdisciplinary research, and interdisciplinary collaboration, demonstrating the global impact of Smithsonian Science, most notably with respect to the United Nations ' Sustainable Development Goals. Reach ing Everyone through Smithsonian Education The final strategic focus area is the Smithsonian 's education al goal to create a national culture of learning . We have many education, learning, and discovery spaces in our museums and research centers. Our Science Education Center, Affiliate museums, and the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service work diligently to bring our virtual educational offerings in history, culture , and science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STE AM) to every state nationwide and countries around the world. To broaden our reach and maximize our impact, we have set a goal to access every pre-K-12 classroom in America . We are beginning to implement an Institution -wide effort to reach 56 state and Tribal education agencies , 50 million students, and 3.2 million teachers with our educational resources and programming. The effect we can have with underserved students is particularl y profound given significant achievement and opportunity gaps for low -income and racial/ethnic minority students, students with disabilities, and English learners. Smithsonian staff are work ing with other educators around the country to help students thrive , making a substantial difference in national educational outcomes . We will achieve this by enabling our educational specialists to work with key stakeholders in develop ing and implement ing a comprehensive Smithsonian education strategy that will allow our education programming, tools, and resources to have greater reach, greater relevance, and a more profound impact, and provide a unified message to teachers, students, partners, and donors. The Office of the Under Secretary for Education will facilitate capacity building and resource distribution to strategically leverage the work already occurring in the units and ramp up signature offerings. By w orking with partners, collaborators, colleagues, and advocates for educa tion, we will help build a national culture of learning to ensure that our audiences have the tools they need to understand and navigate the world around them , even in underserved communities where resources are scarce . Part of our educational strategy w ill also include using technology to reach more learners and develop needs -based content strategies, implementing a unified approach to educational research and broadening the distribution of resources and services through strategic partnerships to grow the digital skills and capacity of the Smithsonian education community and increase the impact of our offerings .The Smithsonian Office of Educational Technology will lead this initiative , building on existing digital platforms such as our Smithsonian Learning Lab that ha s had great success in providing lesson plans, materials, and activities in history, design, and STE AM. It will also expand Web-based and broadcast technologies , seek out partnerships to increase our capacity and reach, and develop new resources aligned with educator needs . 4 Looking Ahead With our new areas of strategic focus , the Smithsonian will be better equipped to address relevant topics through scientific research, collecting, and public programming on topics such as climate change, cultural heritage protection, zoonotic diseases, life after the COVID -19 pandemic (as well as the science related to it), and unde rstanding the impact of race on our nation. By rigorously studying important societal issues , we will continue proving our relevance to the diverse and expansive audiences we serve. Thanks to the wisdom and boldness of Congress , we have been entrusted with bringing to life two new museums . The recent opening of the Molina Family Latino Gallery in the National Museum of American History provides a n important preview of what visitors can expect from the Latino Museum , and we are ready to proceed with both new museums pending legislative action on the sites we identified. The NMAL and SAWHM will help the Smithsonian further reimagine what new museums look like in a post -pandemic world , expand the meaning of the American story, and better serve our fellow citizens . As the leader of this influential scientific, cultural, and educational institution, I believe it is essential for us to exercise our power to bring people together to share big ideas and varying perspectives about important topics that touch all aspects of society such as race relations , a deadly virus , or the meaning of democracy . The Smithsonian , as a gift to the United States, has an obligation to work for the common good by giving back value to our country and increas ing the public's ability to understand our universe, our history, and our shared future . With the continued support of the Administration , Congress , and the American people, I have no doubt we will achieve our goals. T he Smithsonian will continue to welcome everyone to learn, marvel , and dream , using our creativity , imagination, and intellectual capital for the good of society. We will also continue the ongoing project and grand tradition of transforming this hallowed Institution into a cauldron of ideas, innovation , and understanding that reaches more people and has greater impact than ever before.

In addition, t he Institution requests an increase (+$311,000) to support the Smithsonian Folklife Festival's compliance with National Park Service (NPS) regulations in its management of the National Mall . Because of the continued issues of security on and around the Mall, the NPS has called for stronger security measures for the Festival, including greater numbers of officers, specialized armed officers, and enhanced security camera surveillance. The Institution must cover the se necessary costs to maintain public safety and security and to comply with federal NPS requirements . 17 SUMMARY OF FY 20 24 S&E PROGRAM CHANG ES FY 202 3 Base ($000s) FY 202 4 Program Changes ($000s) FY 202 Research 54,689 +1,000 0 New Museums +10,000 +36 National Museum of the American Latino 10,392 +4,000 +13 Smithsonian American Women's History Museum 9,568 +4,000 +16 Central Operations Support for New Museums +7 Total S&E Program Increases +$47,045 +109 Note: For a complete list of program categories, see page 37 RESEARCH Category FY 202 4 Program Increase ($000s) FY 202 4 FTE Change Scientific Research +5,900 +10 Giant Magellan Telescope +800 +1 Research Program Initiatives Pool +2,000 +0 Marine Science Research +1,100 +2 +10 FTEs) Harnessing the Smithsonian's expertise to elevate science in the global discourse is a key focus area in the Smithsonian's Strategic Plan. The Institution includes a leading science and research complex, with thousands of experts and rich partnerships with academia and the private sector. The Smithsonian remains fully committed to expanding our understanding of life on Earth and our place in the universe through its two major science initiatives: Life on a Sustainable Planet and Solving the Mysteries of the Universe . We will explore the tipping and turning points in the evolution of galaxies, solar systems, and planets, and study challenges to ecosystems and biodiversity facing our world. The FY 2024 Budget supports the programs described below to advance s cience, technology, and innovation within the Institution and achieve a high return of benefits from the investment in research. G-CLEF Instrument (+$800,000, +1 FTE) \u2014The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observator y (SAO) is assembling a spectrograph instrument known as the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) Consortium Large Earth Finder (G -CLEF) that will help characterize Earth -like planets around other stars. G -CLEF will enter a multi - year integration period beginnin g in December of 2023. This period requires increased coordination as well as tooling and fixturing to enable these parts to be carefully assembled into the G-CLEF instrument. The request includes $800,000 in FY 2024 to fabricate the required tooling and major handling fixtures for the G - CLEF instrument and support a manufacturing engineer position to coordinate and oversee its assembly. It will take years to build and fully test the G -CLEF instrument and given its significance to the success of any future Extremely Large Telescope we must begin investment now. Finally, the G -CLEF instrument is intended for the Giant Magellan Telescope, bu t it can be used at other facilities. The request also includes $187,000 and 1 FTE for a science position at the SAO to help oversee development of the G -CLEF instrument and play a key role in commissioning the spectrograph. Research Program Initiatives Pool (+$2,000,000) \u2014 The funding requested will continue to support the innovative research pool that is managed by the Under Secretary for Science and Research. The pool fosters a research environment conducive to scientific i nnovation and provides the essential financial support needed to execute world -class science. Priority is given to high -risk, high -reward activities that lead to new ways of collecting and analyzing data and build technical capabilities within the Smithson ian's established areas of research. Priority is also given to research on nature -and community -based solutions to help promote living sustainably with nature. This program will help the Institution recruit and retain the finest scientific talent, support postdoctoral researchers, and build a diverse science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce. 19 The funding criteria will be flexible enough to respond to unique research opportunities that could change our understanding of how Earth 's ecosystems operate, as well as new discoveries beyond Earth . The funds will be distributed through both competitive and more targeted efforts. Program administrators expect to allocate the funding in several tracks; for example, through internally competit ive seed and innovation grants, and start -up funds for new researchers. The funding would also be used to analyze large datasets produced by Smithsonian research in numerous areas, including biodiversity and ecosystems science, astronomy and planetary science , and genomics. There is a definite need for expanded capabilities to analyze the enormous amounts of data generated by our scientists. This request will provide the resources needed to address the Smithsonian's strategic goals for digitization; STEM education through citizen science ; and especially large, visionary , interdisciplinary research projects usi ng large data sets. These funds would help build and support the data platform that can connect collections, research, and global data, making the platform more interoperable and useful for scientists answering complex research questions about important is sues of our time. The goal is to develop a collaborative knowledge platform that connects collections and research data and links it to global data resources using the largest natural history collection in the world. Support for this pool would represent a major leap forward in our ability to put all the pieces together and identify solutions to many of the challenging problems we face today. Other examples of cutting -edge research to be funded include: One Health (interactions between human, animal, plan t, and ecosystem health ); biodiversity genomics (answering questions about ecology and evolution ); movement of animals across landscapes; studying endangered and invasive species ; and how climate change affects all these areas. In addition, in the areas of astronomy and planetary science, the research would include h ow to find evidence of life on other planet s, what conditions lead to habitabilit y, and w hat physical -chemical processes lead to the great diversity among planets in our solar system and beyond . The Institution will also use these funds to help communicate these results to the public as only the Smithsonian can, through public programs, exhibits, and educational materials. Marine Science Research (+$1,100,000, +2 FTEs) \u2014 The Institution requests funding (+$950,000, +1 FTE) to support the Center for Ocean Science at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama that leads the marine social, ecological, biological, and physical monitoring program on climate in the Eastern Tropical Pacific and the Caribbean Ocean. The request will support a marine monitoring coordinator for all STRI research, allowing scientists to work with partners to support marine protected areas as well as sustainable local fisheries . In addition, these resources will replace critical monitoring infrastructure, including the replacement of a 22-year-old small boat with a new vessel that will enhance research opportunities in the Gulf of Panama and beyond. 20 In addition, the request includes funding for the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) to support new and innovative research collaborations on major coastal environmental issues related to climate, biodiversity, and resilience by enhancing and expanding its S cientific Visitor Program (+$150,000, +1 FTE). As SERC's profile has grown for its expertise on major coastal environmental issues, demand for on -site workshops for visiting scholars has increased to include synthesiz ing data and inform ing restoration effo rts. Present staffing is inadequate to support existing activities, let alon e meet new and increasing demands for collaborative problem solving. This additional funding will support a coordinator for the program, enabling more visiting scholars to particip ate. Biodiversity Research (+$2,000,000, +7 FTEs) \u2014 The Smithsonian is well known for research products , which help sustain biological diversity, assess the effects of climate change , and develop equitable, nature -based resilience strategies for understand ing and manag ing invasive specie s and infectious diseases. The Institution's assets include one of the world's largest groups of scientists working on the biology of plants and animals, a network of Earth observation platforms and field stations, and huge collections of specimens and libraries of biodiversity resources. Additional information on this request is provided in the Enhanced Interdisciplinary Research section of this budget submission. o Global Earth Observatories, ForestGEO and MarineGE O (+$1,000,000, + 5 FTEs ) \u2014 The mission of our Global Earth Observatory (GEO) networks is to accelerate understanding of the diversity and functioning of forest and marine ecosystems to predict their futures and sustain their vital roles in supporting life on Earth. The world's forest and marine ecosystems support all aspects of life on Earth: everything from providing food, medicines, and building materials to storing carbon and regulating climate . They have never been under more pressure from the dual threats of climate and land -use changes. Research -based global solutions are required to mitigate these risks and increase ecosystem resilience : our networks provide the deep science to allow ground -truth based solutions . The Smithsonian GEOs have developed gl obally distributed in-situ monitoring and experimental observatories on land (ForestGEO) and in the sea (MarineGEO) which , coupled with new global scientific capacity and satellite data , will transform our understanding of these ecosystems and provide policy makers with options for their future sustainable management. For FY 202 4, the Institution requests funding (+$400,000 and + 2 FTEs) for the Forest GEOs . The ForestGEO network provide s long -term scientific data about biodiversity and the ecological, hydrological, soil, and meteorological processes associated with climate change at local, regional , and global scales , as well as invaluable data on carbon storage . The requested resources will: (i) expand ForestGEO to better represent all major forest types worldwide , transforming the network into a permanent global observation system for the world's forests; (ii) broaden the scientific disciplines 21 addressing forest response to cl imate change through strategic appointments in genomics, microbial ecology , and ecosystem modeling; (iii) ensure the long -term value of ForestGEO science by strengthening the coordination and management of network sites and future data collection; and (iv) increase the role of ForestGEO in science development through Fellowships and training to build the human resources needed to solve the global forest crisis. Together, these steps will provide a robust opportunity to revolutionize our understanding of one of Earth's most biologically complex and important systems. In addition, the Institution requests funds (+$600,000 and + 3 FTEs) f or the Marine Global Earth Observatories, or MarineGEO. The MarineGEO network is dedicated to understanding changes in the st ructure and function of coastal marine ecosystems , as well as monitoring, forecasting, and enhancing resilience to climate change . The MarineGE O sites document and monitor blue carbon, which is critical to identifying nature -based solutions, a nd support local fishery knowledge. These funds will build on existing Smithsonian federal and trust investments and collaboration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Science and Technology Council 's Subcommittee on Ocea n Science and Technology (SOST) , and leverage in-kind support from academic partners to expand the network beyond the initial sites. o Life on a Sustainable Planet (+$1,000,000 , +2 FTEs ) \u2014 The funding requested will support research partnerships and public communications related to our Life on a Sustainable Planet initiative, including work related to environmental resilience, ecosystem monitoring, climate , and related fields . The funds will also enable scientists to coordinate with other national and international efforts. In addition, the new funding will provide research and monitoring infrastructure and support personnel across Smithsonian facilities and programs, allowing the Institution to meet evolving needs and priorities. This will bolster existing monitoring networks (particularly in grasslands) and support establishing new field sites. More information on this can be found in the Enhanced Interdisciplinary Research section of this b udget submission. DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION Category FY 20 24 Program Increase ($000s) FY 2024 FTE Change Digital Transformation +2,400 +7 Pool +1,375 0 Digital Unit +7 22 Digital Transformation (+$2,400,000 , +7 FTEs) A key pillar of the Secretary's strategic framework has been the continued development of the \"Virtual Smithsonian,\" which seeks to leverage the latest digital capabilities and platforms to ensure that every household, classroom, and community across the nation has access to the Smithsonian's digital content. Our \"Virtual Smithsonian\" will serve as a valuable, trusted tool to enrich the lives of all Americans no matter their age, location, digital savvy, disability, education, or English proficie ncy. To accomplish this goal, the Smithsonian is embarking on a digital transformation led by the Institution's Office of Digital Transformation (ODT) to make our most valuable assets available to the public wherever, whenever, and however they are most needed. This ambitious vision for a Smithsonian that is equitably accessible to the nation requires us to deliver digital experiences which not only meet the needs of the American people , but also prioritize data -informed efforts to better understand the audiences we are trying to reach. The Smithsonian is uniquely positioned as a trusted source for the nation because of our 155 million objects that have been assembled during our 176 years of history. These iconic collections, especially when digitized for broader access, will offer our staff and the public a powerful resource for research to \"increase and diffuse knowledge,\" and share with the world. Digital Support Pool ( +$1,375,000 ) \u2014 The Institution request s a $1,375,000 increase to continue supporting the Digital Support Pool. Three goals from the Smithsonian's Strategic Plan guide these ambitious efforts: (1) e nsure every home and classroom has access to the Smithsonian's digital content ; (2) be a trusted source that explores and grapples with America's past, present and future ; and (3) harness Smithsonian expertise to elevate science in the global discourse . These goals are more important than ever, because the recent COVID -19 crisis and national reckoning on race and identity both demonstrated that our citizens and the education al sector have come to depend heavily on the Smithsonian as a trusted source for online content. Our focus on digital content is vital to fulfill our responsibilities on all these fronts. During the COVID -19 pandemic , educators and other digital practiti oners across the Smithsonian were able to respond quickly, delivering informative and accessible content and programming for audiences of all ages. The crisis accelerated some digital initiatives already planned or under way and highlighted new opportuniti es. Offerings that were only accessible in person, which limited their reach to local audiences, became virtual and available to national and international audiences. One of the Institution's strengths that we want to continue to leverage is our ability t o engage people in meaningful dialogue right where they live. As a leader in scientific, cultural, and educational fields, it is essential for the Smithsonian to serve as a catalyst for bringing people together to share big ideas and varying perspectives, 23 especially about important topics that touch all aspects of society, such as race relations, a deadly virus, the health of our democracy, or sustainability in the face of global climate change. The Smithsonian has the special ability and obligation to increase the public's understand ing of our universe, our history, and our shared future, and to work for the common good. These requested pool funds will support Institution -wide digital platforms and programs for sharing our collections and digital content , such as Reckoning with Our Racial Past , Life on a Sustainable Planet , and Smithsonian: Where I Live, as well as the Open Access initiative, the digitization program, the centr al digital transformation function, and volunteer programs such as the Transcription Center which attract thousands of volunteers nationwide every year. In addition, the funding will expand our data science efforts and the information management infrastruc ture to support the logistics and technology for Smithsonian researchers to do their work. This includes continued support of the Data Science Lab that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to extract information from our digitized co llections, perform research, and assist curators and researchers in looking at our objects and specimens in ways that are otherwise not possible, given the massive scale of the national collections. Digital Unit Support (+$1,025,000, +7 FTEs ) \u2014 The Institution requests an increase of $1,025,000 and 7 FTEs to continue developing the \"Virtual Smithsonian\" and leveraging digital capabilities to reach expanded audiences. This funding will support Institution priorities which address high-profile public concerns. The ODT has determined that it is essential for units to have the support staff and this increase includes additional staff embedded in key units to support our top pr iorities and digital efforts. This will enhance the capabilities of units so they can produce more digital content and better transform their workflows to reach expanded and underserved audiences. In addition, this funding would enable the ODT to hire n ew staff members for its central data and customer experience teams that will help develop and implement a Smithsonian -wide, data -informed digital strategy to put people at the center of our digital offerings. By adding this capacity, the Smithsonian will be able to deliver a connected, seamless experience across our entire Institution that is focused on diverse audience s, informed by data, and driven by our ne w Strategic Plan. The additional resources and staff will also support website modernization and digital transformation efforts. It is essential to have the support staff who can better leverage data and technology to serve the public with our digital resources. Our physical museums and research centers attract tens of thousands of visitors every year, yet a strengthened virtual strategy provides an opportunity to reach even more parts of the country and expand our offerings for far larger audiences. Spec ifically, the additional funds will enable the Institution to advance its goal of ensuring that every household and classroom can access the Smithsonian's digital 24 content. By building a foundation of digital capabilities centered on the customer experience , the Smithsonian will develop Web enhancements to meet the needs of the public and provide the greatest educational impact in line with the Institution's mission \"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\" The systems supported by this request are the infrastructure that enables the Smithsonian's collections and other content to be made available to our online audiences. The funding is therefore crucial to achieve the Institution's transformation goals and strategic priorities. Additional justification s for this request are provided in the respective unit budget submissions. EDUCATION Category FY 20 24 Program Increase ($000s) FY 2024 FTE Change Education Support +2,440 +6 Pool +1,500 0 Education +6 Education Support (+$2,440,000 , +6 FTEs) The Smithsonian is the nation's \u2014 and one of the world's \u2014 most dynamic resources to support and enhance lifelong learning. Our 21 museums, three cultural centers , 21 libraries and archives, six research centers, six education centers, and the National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute encompass every part of the human experience \u2014 art, history, culture, and science \u2014 and make connections between artistic expressio n and scientific discovery, future and historic research, individuals, and communities at both global and local levels . The Smithsonian has evolved into one of the foremost education organizations in the country , supporting both informal and formal educa tion ecosystems. Our educators enlighten, inspire, and engage people of all ages with rich and diverse programming. Simply put, our approach to education engagement, programming, and outreach strives to empower and equip teachers, accelerate student learni ng, broaden access to engaging content, and provide vast opportunities for exploration. In addition to providing in-person engagement within our museums and research centers , the Office of the Under Secretary for Education is developing a national strategy to work with state education agencies, districts, schools, and o ther partners to support learning experiences in communities across the nation. Therefore, additional invest ment s in education staff and programming are needed t o ensure America' s premier museum complex reaches communities nation wide. 25 Education Initiatives Pool \u2014 The Institution is requesting funding of $1,500,000 for a new Education Initiatives Pool, which would be administrated by the Office of the Under Secretary for Education, to support unit -specific programming, outreach, and projects. Annually , educators across the Institution reach approximately four million people t hrough programing and outreach and our 300+ educators disseminate more than 10 million publications to communities. Smithsonian educators are skilled at curating inter -disciplinary learning experiences to support teacher professional learning, design relev ant instructional resources, create student -centered interactives, provide in -person , hands -on engagement, structured out -of-school -time experiences. In FY 2024, the Education Initiatives Pool will support unit -specific education projects and programming and accelerate collaborations with more than 200 affiliate museum s and cultural institutions across the nation. In addition, the funding will support our traveling exhibits, which last year reached 156 communities and 41 states. Pool funds are also used to help improve student outcomes and enhance student learning outside of the classroom . To do this, the Smithsonian has embarked on new partnerships with trusted out -of-school organizations to reach millions of you ng people across the country . The requested pooled funds will support outreach, programming and engagement with these entities. Education Unit Support \u2014 The Institution also requests funds ( +$940,000 and +6 FTEs) to support six units that will play an essential role in delivering programs and serving schools and educators nationwide. The additional positions will increase unit -specific engagement to support overall strategic priorities. For example, units will increase digital education re sources and expand virtual platforms; help ensure a world -class academic experience; strengthen engagement with community partners , particularly in rural and Tribal communities; help school districts engage in relevant and meaningful instruction and educat ional activities; and support partnerships with teachers and parents to provide the hands -on learning and exploration that promotes science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) skills in learners of all ages. Additional justification s for this request are provided in the respective unit budget submissions. EXHIBIT IONS Category FY 20 24 Programs Exhibit Support: FTEs) The requested increase will support the Institution's traveling exhibitions managed by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service and Smithsonian Affiliations (SITES | Affiliations) . The two new national outreach managers would serve as an integral part of the Smithsonian's outreach to the nation. O ur current national outreach managers serve as the primary liaison s for more than 200 Smithsonian Affiliate organizations across the United States , Panama , and the local communities that fall unde r their areas of responsibility. In the conduct of their duties, they often reach broad and underserved audiences and connect Affiliates to the resources, content, and expertise of the Smithsonian , and develop programs, exhibitions, and other educational o fferings for Affiliate communities. The n ational outreach managers have a broad understanding of their audience s' needs and the best way to deliver programs both digitally and in -person. These two new positions will support Smithsonian efforts to build and enrich a national culture of learning while also expand ing access to the Institution's digital content. COLLECTIONS Category FY 20 24 Program FY FTEs) Collections stewardship is a key component and core priority of the Smithsonian's Strategic Plan. Assembled throughout the Institution's 176 -year history, the national collections are fundamental to carrying out the Smithsonian's mission and serving as the intellectual capital for scholarship, exhibition, and education. The proper management, documenta tion, preservation, and accessibility of the collections are essential to the nation's research and education infrastructure, enabling researchers to address such significant challenges as the spread of invasive species and the loss of biological diversity and its impact on global ecosystems and human welfare, as well as to better understand our nation's complex and rich cultural history. Collections Support (+$1,775,000, +4 FTEs ) \u2014 The requested funds will support the establishment of a new Shared Stewardship and Ethical Returns Program at the Smithsonian. Specifically, funding is requested for the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) (+$1,400,000 and +2 FTEs) and the office and +2 FTEs) . In accordance with the Secretary's policy and guidance , the program authorizes collecting units to return collections, in appropriate circumstances, based on ethical considerations. How a collection was origi nally acquired and the context of its 27 acquisition are important considerations. Circumstances demonstrating unethical acquisition may include items that were stolen, taken under duress, or removed without consent of the owner. This program will address o ne of the Institution's top priorities by considering ethical issues embedded in NMNH collections and helping foster better relationships with communities and countries around the world. There is a growing understanding at the Smithsonian and in the museum community that our possession of collections carries with it certain ethical obligations to the places and people where the collections originated. Among these obligations is to evaluate , using contemporary moral norms, what should be in our collections a nd what should not. Additional information is provided in the N MNH budget section. Funds are also requested for the NCP office to support Institution -wide efforts related to the implementation and oversight of the Shared Stewardship and Ethical Returns Program as well as engagement on other collections issues. The NCP office provides central leadership , policy oversight, strategic planning, and support for Institution -wide collections initiatives. Additional fund s are needed to sustain its leadership, coordination, and support of current and future collections initiatives, including innovative collectio ns space planning, collections preservation environments, collections emergency management, and sustainable collections care. Further information is provided in the Administration section of this budget submission. Animal Welfare (+$1,500,000, +5 FTEs) \u2014 Additional resources are requested for the National Zoo and Conserv ation Biology Institute (NZCBI) to provide for the health, well -being, and safety of our animal collection, staff, and Zoo visitors. The accepted standards and industry best practices for medical care, husbandry, animal welfare, and safety for Zoo animals are continually increasing. The needs of animal care collections, including staff support and safety, continue to rise as our understanding of the unique challenges of caring for critically endangered species improve. For example, federal and state regulations require intensive animal quarantining and scre ening procedures to prevent disease transmission from wildlife to livestock, people, and other animals in the NZCBI living collection. As another example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced in 2023 a final rule to establish new regulations and standards governing the handling, care, treatment, and transportation of birds covered by the Animal Welfare Act. Although NZCBI has successfully met the accepted levels of animal care standards thus far, it required redirect ing resources to do so, wh ich is not a sustainable approach in the long term. Additionally, new veterinary medical procedures, diagnostic, and testing require upgraded medical equipment and more specialized professional expertise. Moreover, breeding and research protocols designed to save endangered species from extinction require a new, more time -intensive, sophisticated management approach to ensure the safety of both animals and staff. The increased cost s of food, including hay, a main food source for many animals, and life -saving medicines have significantly impacted the NZCBI operating budget. In the last five years, the 28 costs of some consumer market food products increased by an average of 60 percent , life-saving medicine and other veterinary supplies and services increased by 70 percent , and hay field management labor and operational costs increased by approximately 88 percent . Managing these con stant increases , which are partly due to the inflationary effects of supply chain disruptions, has forced tough and strategic decisio ns related to healthcare and nutrition management, thus increasing the risk of providing time -sensitive animal care. Finally, the NZCBI continues to modernize and update its historic 1920s -era infrastructure and animal enclosures. Maintaining animal habitats and providing specialized items for animals' health and well -being as well as staff and public safety are required by oversight and regulatory entities such as the Association of Zoos and A quariums (AZA) and the USDA. These standards are essential to appropriately care for our living collection while safeguarding the public and staff. Without the additional resources and specialized exhibits support, the quality of animal care and the visito r experience will be diminished , and the NZCBI's professional accreditation may be put at risk . FACILITIES SERVICES Category FY 20 24 Program Increase ($000s) FY 2024 Facilities Maintenance (+$8,600,000, +10 FTEs) \u2014 The Smithsonian requests an additional $8,600,000, including 10 additional FTEs, to improve facilities management practices, slow the growth of deferred maintenance backlog, reverse the decline of facilities conditions, and provide acceptable space for Smithsonian exhibits, research, collectio ns, and staff. The Institution's facilities conditions have declined, resulting in adverse impacts to Smithsonian operations, collections , and visitor experiences. Coupled with growing inflationary factors, the deteriorating facilities conditions have c aused Smithsonian's deferred maintenance backlog to increase to $1.76 billion . The increased funding will support hiring additional building maintenance personnel as well as facilities asset management professionals to improve the overall facilities mana gement program. This will allow the Institution to ensure the preventive maintenance of facilities systems is optimally scheduled and performed. It will also enable the improved identification, prioritization, programming, and execution of 29 facilities repai r project to address the most significant deferred maintenance requirements in the most cost -effective manner. As a result, facilities conditions will gradually improve to better support the mission and reputation of the Institution. Specifically, the incr eased funding and improved facilities maintenance program will help ensure that proper environmental conditions are maintained for the national collections and the visitor experience. These essential funds will enable the Institution to complete additional repairs on life -safety systems; elevators and escalators; heating, ventilation, and air -conditioning systems; plumbing infrastructure; roofing systems; and exterior hardscapes. It will also allow the Institution to address the need for hazardous material abatement in the Smithsonian's many aging facilities. Several of the Institution's national museums have experienced water leaks, sewage system failures, humidity spikes, and other adverse impacts resulting from failing infrastructure. With the funds reque sted, the Smithsonian will significantly reduce the incidence of such failures and resulting damages and preserve not only the collections but the Institution's world -class reputation as the American public expects. Facilities Operations (+$4,400,000, +8 FTEs) \u2014 Operating under a \"new normal\" in the post -pandemic era, as well recent inflationary pressures, requires additional resources to keep the Smithsonian's staff, volunteers, and visitors safe. This request provides funding to cover inflationary cost i ncreases for contracts, supplies, and materials, as well as additional cleaning demands, a nd to fill vacant positions which could not be filled because of increased operating costs. In addition, it will provide resources to fund a training program administ rator and contract support to address gaps in the Smithsonian safety and health training programs and emergency capabilities. Finally, t he requested funds will be used to develop emergency plans and training exercises to enhance the Institution's security response to active shooters , extreme weather events, and natural/manmade and technological hazards. Despite efforts to improve efficiencies and outcomes, more resources are required to achieve acceptable standards of service and cleanliness. In addition, the revitalization of spaces, including the National Air and Space Museum, with modern and higher gloss finishes and exhibits, which get more traffic and require greater time and effort for cleaning, has intensified cleaning demands at the same time there is an increased need to keep public areas better sanitized in accordance with post - pandemic protocols. The requested funds will also absorb the costs of NZCBI cleaning, snow removal, and trash removal and recycle operations which were once covered by the F riends of the National Zoo (FONZ) before its relationship with the NZCBI was dissolved during the pandemic. The Smithsonian's goal is to achieve Association of Physical Plant Administrators (APPA) cleanliness Level 2, Ordinary Tidiness. Currently, the Smithsonian does not have sufficient resources to maintain the lower APPA Level 3 Casual Tidiness standard, which is resulting in a lack of cleanliness and sanitation in our museums. The funds requested will allow the Smithsonian to maintain the APPA L evel 3 standard and get closer to our goal of achieving APPA Level 2. 30 This request also includes funding to continue procurement of electric vehicles (including plug-in hybrid technology) and associated charging infrastructure as the Institution transitions its motor vehicle fleet to clean and zero -emission vehicles. The Smithsonian uses base fleet resources to operate new electric vehicles brought into the fleet and accelerate installation of the necessary charging infrastructure. Security (+$4,200,000, +2 FTEs) \u2014 The Smithsonian has the solemn obligation and responsibility to provide adequate security for our staff, visitors, and museums on the National Mall. Security officers and staff represent our front line of defense, and it is imperative that we provide ade quate resources to keep our museums safe and open to the public. Unfortunately, recent years have seen a demonstrated increase in violent crime and mass shootings in public spaces. We remain hyper vigilant and have taken many steps to mitigate the risks, including purchasing and installing new advanced electronic screening systems at some of our museum entrances t o prevent the introduction of firearms to our facilities; outfitting our security officers with body armor; and upgrading our Smithsonian -wide e lectronic security system. While federal funding has enabled us to make significant progress in recent years, the Smithsonian remains a soft target in the current climate of internal and external physical threats. As a result, it is vital that we receive a dditional resources to enhance security, accountability, and emergency preparedness to better protect our staff, visitors, and collections. There are still a significant number of visitors who enter our facilities without going through enhanced security screening. Additional funds will allow us to install equipment for the remaining facilities not yet screening visitors. Furthermore , we have identified a need to increase the access control, emergency response, and accountability of our staff to mitigate the increased climate of physical threats, particularly insider threats. Increased funding will allow us to install and implement additional electronic security systems at our staff access points and ensure we are providing a safe and secure workplace. In response to the increased security risks, there is an essential need to enhance police and security response training, as well as provid e annual staff security awareness training against the threat of an active shooter. To evaluate the effectiveness of our existing security resources, the Smithsonian conducted a benchmarking study of armed security officer pay with peer agencies in the Wash ington, DC area . For the Smithsonian, we determined that pay needs to be increased from a GS -5 level to a GS -6 for armed security officers to be competitive with similar agencies . Without the additional funding , Office of Protection Services' officers will continue to leave the Smithsonian for better paying jobs elsewhere. This will lead to higher vacancy rates and ultimately an inability to fully open Smithsonian museums and research centers to the public due to safety concerns . 31 Accordingly, this request provide s for additional equipment, wage increases for security officers, and enhanced security training of staff . Ensuring the safety of every person who walks through the Smithsonian 's doors will always be a top institutional priority. Additional information on these Facilities Services ' requests is provided in the Facilities Maintenance and Facilities Operations, Security , and Support sections of this budget submission. MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS Category FY 20 24 Program Increase ($000s) FY 2024 FTE Change Management Operations +5,530 +19 Information (IT) Security +1,000 0 Human Resources Support +2,500 +11 Unit , +19 FTEs) During the next five years, the Smithsonian will focus on increasing the nimbleness of the organization's administrative functions, both those that are managed centrally and those embedded within the individual museums, cultural and research centers, and u nits. By building stronger connections within the Smithsonian, we will increase the efficiency of our processes and generate more effective and integrated solutions. Equally critical is the goal of fostering an environment for staff that promotes attribute s such as safety, Diversity, Equity, Accessibility and Inclusion (DEAI), professional development, and individual accountability. In addition, we must ensure our information technology (IT) systems are safe and secure. IT Security (+$1,000,000) \u2014 The Institution requests IT security funding (+$1,000,000) to enhance security monitoring and response, as well as to implement initiatives on zero -trust architecture. The funding also supports implementing initiatives on system security and authorization, supply chain risk management, threat intelligence, data -loss prevention, and enhancements to the Institution's security assessment, risk management, and compliance processes. The requested increase will enable the Institution to rapidly detect and respond to increasingly sophisticated threats by expanding our ability to monitor and investigate potentially suspicious activities and identify and address risks to the Smithsonian's supply chain. This funding will also help prevent the inappropriate disclosure or distribution of personal and other sensitive information and integrate security components for better visibility into our systems' enterprise risk. Additionally, the requested funds will enabl e the Institution to enhance security training and improve compliance with payment card industry data security standards. 32 These resources are vital for the Smithsonian to effectively detect malicious activity; monitor and protect sensitive data; defend the Institution against sophisticated threats ; investigate suspicious activity; manage risk both internally and from the cyber -supply chain; and adapt the Smithsonian's electronic defenses to the evolving business needs of an increasingly remote and widespre ad work environment and the growing problem of cybercrime . Human Resources Support (+$2,500 ,000, +11 FTEs) \u2014 Given the importance of attracting and maintaining an effective talent pipeline, while also focusing on staff retention and employee engagement, having sufficient resources available to support the Smithsonian's Office of Human Resources (OHR) is vital. This request will continue ongoing efforts designed to improve hiring timeliness, provide quality and timely advice to managers and sta ff, increase staff training, and improve overall customer service to Smithsonian units. It is imperative for our success that the Smithsonian attract and hire the best talent while honoring DEAI in every work role within the Institution. The requested funding will support hiring additional staff in OHR to ensure that the Smithsonian meets or exceeds its hiring targets, develop s and implement s business process improvement strategies to enhance our time -to-hire, establish es a more robust performance management system, and provide s additional resources to develop and deliver a wide range of training courses for the entire Smithsonian workforce . Unit Management Support (+$2,030,000, + 8 FTEs) \u2014 This request supports eight new positions to provide the important operational and management support that will ensure efficient operations in several units , including for the Office of the Inspector General. Our Strategic Plan approach emphasizes improving both centr al and unit -based operations, since they are all part of an integrated system. Within this area of focus, f unding is requested to support the new Office of the Head Diversity Officer (+$800,000 and +3 FTEs). To ensure the Smithsonian is fully activating and responding to concerns a bout DEAI, the Secretary created a diversity office at the highest level of the organization to lead these efforts, build community, and engage throughout the Institution. The requested resources will provide the fund ing to staff the new office , enable it to develop Institution -wide training and guidelines , and build the community between the Smithsonian and people with disabilities through targeted outreach strategies. Th e Institution aspires to embody DEAI ideals in both our workforce and external programs and scholarship and continues to expand its reach, both within the Smithsonian and with external stakeholders, including the disability community, the museum field, and disability advocacy and justice organizations. Current staff members' responsibilities and performance elements continue to increase in scope as the Smithsonian's implementation of DEAI initiatives grows. Additional funds are requested for management support staff at the National Museum of American History (NMAH) (+$ 220,000 and +2 FTEs) and the Smithsonian Environmental 33 Research Center (SERC) (+$110,000 and +1 FTE). Investing in these positions will improve the procurement, communications, budgeting, human resources, and performance evaluation functions t o provide efficient, nimble, cost -effective, and innovative operations. We want to devote resources to these important management positions because they are essential to museum and center operations. The lack of management support pos itions at NMAH and SERC has required other professional staff to focus on administrative tasks instead of the jobs they were hired to do. This request also includes additional funding (+$900,000 and +2 FTEs) for the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) to support contract audits in two high -risk areas (IT security and construction expenditures) and two essential positions ( a deputy assistant inspector general for audits and a n auditor). The OIG has been paying for the audits of these two high-risk areas with salary -lapsed funds caused by OIG's chronic staffing shortfalls However, starting in FY 2023, the OIG will be fully staffed and will need additional requested funds to pay for these annual high -risk audits. NEW MUSEUMS Category FY 202 4 Program Increase ($000s) FY 2024 FTE Change New Museums +10,000 +36 National Museum of the American Latino +4,000 +13 Smithsonian American Women's History Museum +4,000 +16 Central Operations Support for New Museums +2,000 +7 New Museums (+$10,000 ,000, + 36 FTEs) National Museum of the American Latino (+$4,000,000, +13 FTEs ) \u2014 Public Law 116 -260, signed by the President on December 27, 2020, established the National Museum of the American Latino (NMAL) within the Smithsonian Institution. The mission of NMAL is to give voice to the richness and challenges of the Latino American experience so all people can better understand how it reflects the depth, complex ity, and promise of the American experience, and serve as a national forum for collaborati ng on and celebrati ng Latino American history and culture through educational and social institutions. Specifically, the Museum will be the keystone for people in the United States and visitors worldwide to learn more about Latino contributions to life, art, history, and culture in the United States , as well as a gateway for visitors to view Latino exhibitions, collections, and pr ogramming at other Smithsonian Institution facilities and museums nationwide . 34 Funding in the request will enable NMAL to continue recruit ing and selecti ng initial personnel; form ing planning and coordination teams to develop exhibitions , public programs, education, research, collections acquisition, technology , and capital fund raising; and develop ing administrative operations . Smithsonian American Women's History Museum (+$4,000,000, +16 FTEs ) \u2014 Public Law 116 -260, signed by the President on December 27, 2020, also established the Smithsonian American Women's History Museum (SAWHM) within the Smithsonian Institution. Currently, t here is no national museum in the United States devoted to document ing women's contributions throughout the nation's history. On December 19, 2014, Congress created a commission to study the potential for an American museum of women's history. The bipartisan commission unanimously concluded that the United States needs and deserves a national museum dedicated to showcasing the historical experiences and impact of women in the United States.

Funding these efforts will enable the Smithsonian to integrate the work of many disciplines within and across our museums and cultural and research centers, as well as broaden external collaborations. The p rograms are grounded in research and emphasize complementary education and outreach; together, they will influence how the Smithsonian directs its resources and focuses its energies. The Institution has developed and implemented initiatives to advance cros s- disciplinary, integrated scholarly efforts which use a competitive internal process to distribute externally raised funds for advancing research, revitalizing education, and harnessing the power of emerging technology. The funding may also help to levera ge additional resources, both internal and external, thereby amplifying the scope and breadth of cross -cutting research initiatives. Funds are distributed through existing Smithsonian units with subject -matter expertise to make the most cost -effective use of expenditures in the areas being supported. Although there are no specific units primarily associated with these initiatives, all Smithsonian museums, cultural and research centers, and offices will look for opportunities to integrate the Institution's research goals and objectives into their 38 activities and programs. The table below summarizes the FY 2024 programs in the four centers. Programs FY 202 3 Enacted $000s FY 2024 Request $000s Change $000s Universe Center 184 184 0 Biodiversity Center 1,563 3,563 +2,000 World Cultures Center 1,292 1,292 0 American Experience Center 600 600 0 Total 3,639 5,639 +2,000 EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes an increase of $2,000,000 , which provides a programmatic increase for biodiversity research. The requested increase will help make research on important societal issues more focused, relevant, and rigorous for \"the increase and diffusion of knowledge,\" which is our core mission. The budget also supports the Smit hsonian's efforts to modernize and manage our research infrastructure and applies to scientific collections and biological field stations, as well as interagency partnerships, such as those with the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and its relationship with our Forest and Marine Global Earth Observatories. Specifically, these resources will enhance the science for conserving biodiversity and ecosystems in ways that support culture, livelihoods, and social equity. While other research ins titutions work in fields which may resemble those of the Smithsonian, the Institution's scientific initiatives complement the operations of our federal agency and university partners. The federal appropriation we receive enables us to approach research fro m a uniquely long -term perspective. We establish observatories that collect data for many decades, enabling studies to keep acquiring collections and data for use by scientists and citizens nationwide and throughout the world. The Smithsonian is also well-positioned to communicate these research results to the public. The Institution's scientific research enhances but does not duplicate that of our partner federal agencies such as the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Interior, Commerce, and Defense, all of which have staff in residence at our facilities; or our contracted partners such as the United States Navy, United States Air Force, Federal Aviation Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), for wh om we share our expertise to boost the quality and impact of federally funded science for natural resource management. Our exceptional scientific staff collaborates regularly with research universities in the United States and abroad , as faculty benefit fr om participating in the Smithsonian's long -term research studies and the Institution recognizes the expertise these scientists bring to those programs in return. This mutually beneficial arrangement adds value to the research conducted by both public -and private -sector participants and results in a more efficient, symbiotic coordination of our resources. 39 Category FY 2024 Program Increase ($000s) FY Global Earth +5 Life on a Sustainable Planet +$2,000 +7 Biodiversity Research (+$2,000,000, +7 FTEs) The Smithsonian has a special role nationally and globally in not only conducting biodiversity and ecosystem research, but also training the next generation of scientists and providing infrastructure and information which enable research by others. Everyth ing the Institution does in biology \u2014 from acquiring collections and conducting research to advancing education and outreach \u2014 is potentially useful to the bioeconomy , which represents the infrastructure, innovation, products, technology, and data derived from biologically related processes. The biological sciences also drive economic growth, promote public health, and increase social benefits for the American people. For example, much of the Smithsonian's research as part of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) is directly relevant to biosecurity ; such as keeping diseases and pests away from animals, people, and property; and biosurveillance monitoring th at detects and prevents the spread of pests and diseases and contributes to long -term public - health security goals . The Smithsonian is well known for research products which help sustain biological diversity, assess the effects of climate and develop equ itable, nature -based resilience strategies, and understand and manage invasive species and infectious diseases. The Institution's assets include one of the world's largest groups of scientists working on the biology of plants and animals, a network of Eart h observation platforms and field stations, and huge collections of specimens and libraries of resources. Global Earth Observatories, ForestGEO and MarineGEO (+$1,000,000, + 5 FTEs ) The mission of our Global Earth Observatory (GEO) networks is to accelerate understanding of the diversity and functioning of forest and marine ecosystems to predict their futures and sustain their vital roles in supporting life on Earth. The world's fores t and marine ecosystems support all aspects of life on Earth: everything from providing food, medicines, and building materials to storing carbon and regulating climate. They have never been under more pressure from the dual threats of climate and land -use changes. Research -based global solutions are required to mitigate these risks and increase ecosystem resilience: our networks provide the deep science to allow ground -truth based -solutions. The Smithsonian GEOs have developed globally distributed in-situ monitoring and experimental observatories on land (ForestGEO) and in the sea 40 (MarineGEO) which , coupled with new global scientific capacity and satellite data, are transform ing our understanding of these ecosystems and provid ing policy makers with options for their future sustainable management. The Smithsonian provides the essential foundation for these networks, based on: 1) long-term global leadership and workforce development in biodiversity science; 2) multi -disciplinary science that draws on the res ources of the Tropical Research Institute (STRI), Environmental Research Center (SERC), National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute (NZCBI), and the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH); 3) inter -agency collaborations, including those with the Nat ional Science Foundation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Energy, NEON, Long -Term Ecological Research, and BOEM; 4) scientific and educational partnerships with diverse U .S. universities; 5) leadership in open science and information and knowledge dissemination; 6) programs for strengthening scientific capacity nationally and internationally; and 7) enhancing international partnerships built through science -based diplomacy . For FY 2024, the Institution requests funding (+$400,000 and +2 FTEs) for the Forest GEOs. The ForestGEO network provides long -term scientific data about biodiversity and the ecological, hydrological, soil, and meteorological processes associated with c limate change at local, regional, and global scales, as well as invaluable data on carbon storage. The requested resources will: (i) expand ForestGEO to better represent all major forest types worldwide , transforming the network into a permanent global observation system for the world's forests; (ii) broaden the scientific disciplines addressing forest response to climate change through strategic appointments in genomics, microbial ecology, and ecosystem modeling; (iii) ensure the long -term value of Fores tGEO science by strengthening the coordination and management of ForestGEO sites and future data collection; and (iv) increase the role of ForestGEO in science development through Fellowships and training to build the human resources needed to solve the gl obal forest crisis. Together, these steps will provide a robust opportunity to revolutionize our understanding of one of Earth's most biologically complex and important systems. In addition, the Institution requests funds (+$600,000 and +3 FTEs) for the M arine Global Earth Observatories, or MarineGEO. The MarineGEO network is dedicated to understanding changes in the structure and function of coastal marine ecosystems, as well as monitoring, forecasting, and enhancing resilience to global change. The Marin eGEO sites document and monitor blue carbon, which is vital to understanding nature -based solutions, a nd support local fishery knowledge. These funds will build on existing Smithsonian federal and trust investments and collaboration with NOAA and the National Science and Technology Council 's (NSTC) Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology (SOST), and lev erage in -kind support from a range of academic partners to expand the network beyond the initial sites. 41 Life on a Sustainable Planet (+$1,000,000 , +2 FTEs) The funding requested will support research partnerships and public communications related to our Life on a Sustainable Planet initiative, including work related to environmental resilience, ecosystem monitoring, climate, and related fields . The funds will also enable Smithsonian scientists to coordina te with other national and international efforts. In addition, the new funding will provide research and monitoring infrastructure and support personnel across Smithsonian facilities and programs, allowing the Institution to meet evolving needs and priorities. The potential practical u ses include bolstering current monitoring networks (particularly in grasslands) and establishing new field sites. 42 NATIONAL AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 7,082 36 16,822 3 765 FY 202 3 131 22,380 69 9,963 37 12,287 2 633 FY 202 131 23,405 69 10,065 38 11,998 2 689 Federal Resource Summary by Performance and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage in vital arts and humanities research 19 3,862 19 4,042 0 180 Digital Transformation Provide improved digitization and audience engagement 1 211 1 221 0 10 Education Provide education support to engage and inspire diverse audiences 4 604 4 632 0 28 Public Programs Provide relevant reference services and disseminate information to the public 8 1,273 8 1,332 0 59 Exhibitions Offer compelling, first-class exhibitions 22 3,609 22 3,777 0 168 Collections Improve the stewardship of the national collections 54 8,510 54 8,904 0 394 Facilities Operations and Maintenance Improve facilities operations and provide a safe and healthy environment 2 394 2 412 0 18 Management Operations Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure 17 3,103 17 3,233 0 130 Information Technology Improve the Institution's information technology systems and infrastructure 4 814 4 852 0 38 Total 131 22,380 131 23,405 01,025Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change 43 BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT The Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum (NASM) collects, preserves, studies, and exhibits artifacts and works of art related to the history, culture, and science of aviation and spaceflight and the study of the universe. Its cutting -edge research and o utreach activities serve multiple audiences within and beyond its walls. The Museum commemorates the past , looks at current and future developments in aerospace, and educat es and inspir es the next generation of innovators and explorers to study and apply s cience, technology, engineering, art , and math (STEAM) to create the future. NASM is administered as one Museum with multiple locations: the National Mall Building (NMB) in Washington, DC ; the Steven F. Udvar -Hazy Center (UHC) in Chantilly, Virginia; and the Paul E. Garber Facility in Suitland, Maryland (a non- public facility) . This past year is most notable for the level of effort expended to prepare the Museum for the safe and successful reopening of its flagship facility on the National Mall. Despite li ngering impacts from the COVID -19 pandemic, increasing costs, and altered schedules, NASM opened eight new galleries in FY 2023 to considerable public and media acclaim. The Museum provides millions of on -site guests from around the world with access to its peerless collection of aerospace artifacts and stories . In calendar year 2022, NASM had 424,000 visitors at the NMB and 1,176,000 at the UHC. In addition, the Museum continued to engage t he public online through enhanced digital resources reaching more than 10 million virtual guests via its website, broadcast/webcast educational programming, and social media. While re opening newly transformed galleries, the Museum successfully released it s new brand and unveiled its improved website. This effort now allows NASM to provide exceptionally large amounts of digital analytics and educational programming through a user -friendly and fully modernized platform. The Museum also completed its first full year of publishing the \"Air and Space Quarterly,\" releasing four public ations on time and rapidly growing its readership. In FY 202 3, NASM continu ed to collect and preserve the nation's key aviation and space artifacts and archival material, as well as those from other countries, and to perform original research and referen ce support in aviation , space history , and planetary science . Core activities support a broad array of exhibitions, programs, publications, and education and outreach project s. As new audience trends emerge after the pandemic, the Museum is balanc ing on-site and online programming t o provid e educational resources and engaging , entertaining , and inspiring content for learners of all ages . NASM accomplish es its public service mandate and reach es diverse audiences by draw ing upon a mix of in -house and contracted resources as well as a large roster of volunteers and docents. Museum exhibits immerse visitors in the stories o f peop le of all backgrounds who have broke n barriers, defied what was thought possible , and changed the world to inspire a new generation to 44 accomplish the amazing. As Apollo 11 command module pilot and the first director of NASM Michael Collins once said, \"To go places and do things that have neve r been done before \u2014 that's what living is all about.\" Today, d igital offerings allow anyone , anywhere to take a path that engages them with the Museum's collection s and stories, provides resources to students, teachers , and researchers , and integrates those elements with the in -person experience to amplify its impact. In FY 202 3, NASM is focused on revitaliz ing the NMB and transform ing all the exhibits there . Preparation for artifact movement as part of the revitalization and transformation effort resulted in a detailed plan to relocate and conserve/preserve more than 4,000 artifacts. This has involved steadily moving artifacts to the Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar and Emil Buehler Conservation Lab at the U HC for treatment . Artifacts are being temporarily stored in the Dulles Collections Center Storage Module or on the public floor of the UHC. Museum teams and contractors are finalizing designs and components for the east end of the building even as NASM senior leadership moves forward with plans for the Bezos Learning Center (BLC) and revisit s master plans for the UHC, all while continuing world -class science and history research program s. MEANS AND STRATEGY Public Engagement \u2014 Learning at NASM sparks curiosity and empowe rs audiences to imagine the possibilities of our collective future. Museum staff continue their efforts to reach diverse group s in meaningful ways through exhibitions, educational programming, research reference support, publications, and digital outreach. In FY 2024, NASM will use its transformation to continue strengthen ing the Museum's role as a learning facilitator and convener by developing experiences t o place the audience at the center of its activities and programs . The Museum will continue to embrace hybrid programming through both online and onsite learning to engage national and local audiences. The team will deploy several tools to track progress. Among those tools are a three -year, digital engagement roadmap, key performance indicators, par ticipation targets calculated with a percentage increase from the previous cycle , and quality assessments conducted by external evaluators. This combined strategy will position NASM as a key stakeholder in building a nation of innovators and explorers via experiences inspired by real -world issues, and rooted in national learning standards, t o help foster critical -thinking skills. Developing these skills in diverse learners will prepare them to be high -quality contributors in a complex 21st century global so ciety and continue advanc ing America's status as home to the world's greatest innovators. As both a national an d community Museum, in FY 2024 NASM will continue adding programs and products to its arc of engagement for learners from p reK to adult levels . Museum staff will support educator s' abilit ies to enhance classroom learning via high -quality professional development focused on teaching with collections and aligned to national learning standards. These efforts include a professional learning community (PLC) of middle -school educators, the Teacher Innovation Institute, on -demand, YouTube -based teacher resources , and 45 workshops and in -service activitie s for schools and community -based organizations. NASM will launch a series of design challenges for youth to leverage resources across the Smithsonian and are rooted in, and have the potential to solve, real -world problems. The Museum will also launch the BLC Student Architecture and Design Challenge by bring ing the team of winning entrants onto the Learning Center's architecture and development team. In addition, the Museum will build upon the success of virtual and on -site student -focused programs and resources to inspire the next generation of innovators and explorers. One component of this work will be continuing to add to the Museum's Web-based learning resources hub that launched in fall of 2022. The presentation of these resources is unique in that users only need select from five drop-down menus to get a series of resources served up to them, elimin ating the many hours classroom educators spend surfing the Web for high -quality resources. The NASM team will also focus on expanding audience awareness of the Museum's suite of online early childhood experiences , Flight of Fancy , which include s readings of air -and-space -inspired original stories, associated craft time segments and accompanying music videos. In FY 2024, NASM staff and volunteers will continue support ing daily experiences for students and families \u2014 such as hands -on science act ivities, demonstrations, virtual planetarium shows, STEAM labs, engineering and design student workshops and resources for learners with autism and sensory perception disorders. The Museum will also facilitate large, multi -faceted, day -long events which can reach tens of thousands of diverse visitors in one day such as Innovations in Flight and Air and Scare. In addition, NASM will recruit its astronomy educators to help develop and implement programming fo r the total solar eclipse in April of 2024 . The M useum continues to advance Institutional priorities by making collections, archival documents, and images available via publicly accessible websites. NASM collections and archiv al databases contain extensive information on the history and provenance of each artifact and are an effective way to offer in -depth information to the public through electronic or digitized means. These electronic resources may also encourage more researche rs to request access to the Museum's many archives and collections, and to make in - person visits to follow -up on initial online research efforts. The NASM Archives set up workflows for attaching digital assets to the Smithsonian Online Virtual Archives (SO VA). Since then, more than 78,844 digital assets were attached to SOVA in FY 2022 , resulting in a total of 1,251,661 digital assets currently available to the public . Exhibitions \u2014 In FY 2023, the Museum continue d to ensure stewardship of and access to its priceless collection of aerospace artifacts and archival materials and produce expert scholarship and research while guiding the fabrication of new exhibitions at the N MB. These exhibits offer a fresh interpretat ion of many stories the artifacts represent. During FY 2023, NASM is finish ing the design and start ing fabrication of 10 new galleries in the east end of 46 the building, including: a rotating exhibit in the Allan and Shelley Holt Innovations Gallery , with th e first installment being about climate change; the Barron Hilton Pioneers of Flight G allery which will feature the famous Spirit of St. Louis airplane that Charles Lindbergh piloted in the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean; the TEXTRON How Things Fly Gallery , with more than 50 mechanical interactives aimed at teaching middle -school students STEAM concepts; the Raytheon Technologies Living in the Space Age Gallery with life - size spacecraft; the Jay I. Kislak World War II in th e Air Gallery , which will display prime examples of military aviation; and the At Home in Space Gallery, Discovering Our Universe Gallery, Flight and the Arts Center, and the Modern Military Aviation Gallery. Additionally, the Museum is finalizing the Boeing Milestones of Flight Hall , which will feature a large screen showing the collection on display in the Museum. Collections \u2014 In support of NASM's transformation , the Museum has completed the de-installation of 3,454 objects from the NMB. Roughly 1,2 00 of these objects will be returning for exhibition, with the balance of 2,200 going on display at the UHC, on loan to other museums , or into storage at the Dulles Collections Storage Module . Approximately 3,000 objects will be installed in the transforme d Museum galleries , including many artifacts never on display before. Most of the artifacts slated for display will require some type of preservation or conservation and the collections staff has estimated the treatment time for each artifact. Treatment of all the artifacts is estimated to take approximately 15,000 workdays, inc luding conservation and preservation. This work has progressed on schedule , with more than 1,000 artifacts already moved, treated, or in treatment. FY 2022 brought some major acquisitions , such as Blue Origin's New Shepard PM4 -2 Propulsion Module and the Intelsat 1 \"Early Bird\" flight test satellite. NASM continues support ing outreach through an active loan program. The Museum collaborate s with private collectors, corporate entities, and Smithsonian and non -Smithsonian museums to secure loans of artif acts to share with the public in new exhibits , inspiring stories of America's role in pioneering aeronautics and space exploration. NASM has engaged with 132 lenders to borrow more than 400 artifacts for the National Mall exhibits. The Museum has an active outgoing loan program that currently supports more than 1,000 objects on loan to 160 borrowers. In FY 2022 , Museum staff relocated 106 medium -sized and 3,956 small artifacts from inadequate storage facilities at the Paul E. Garber Facility in Suitland, Maryland to the UHC in Fairfax County , Virginia . The relocation of artifacts from inadequate to museum -quality storage will continue for the foreseeable future. Facilities \u2014 The Smithsonian is using the Dulles Collections Center Storage Module 1 , next to the UHC , as a swing space for storing artifacts from the NMB as the main Museum undergoes renovations. After completion of the NMB revitalization, 47 this storage module will support the continued move of artifacts from the Garber facility but is only the first of five such buildings required to store all the NASM artifacts remaining at the Garber facility. Accordingly, in FY 2023, NASM has begun designing a second storage module project. In the meantime, NASM has continued making progress on the NMB revitalization effort in FY 2023 , beginning with the public opening of phase 1 west- end Museum exhibition spaces and the continued phase 2 renovation activities in the east half of the NMB. In addition , design work is ongoing for the BLC to be located on the east terrace. Scientific Research \u2014NASM's Center for Earth and Planetary Studies (CEPS) conducts original research related to planetary exploration, with an emphasis on the evolution of solid surfaces throughout the solar system. The Center also curates g alleries and offers public programs in the planetary sciences. NASM scientists currently work as science team members for the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Express, Curiosity Mars rover, InSight Mars lander, Venus EnVision, OSIRIS -APEX (to visit the asteroid Apophis), and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter missions. NASM scientists analyze the data from these and other missions to solar system bodies and convey this exciting information to the public. Original research and publications in scientific literatur e concentrate on the National Research Council and N ational Aeronautics and Space Administration priorities to determine the origin of solar system bodies and habitable planets, with an emphasis on the past climate of Mars and icy moons with subsurface wat er in the outer solar system. Historical Research \u2014 The Museum continues to lead in the field of recording aerospace history by producing books, scholarly articles, and other publications, and by making presentations at professional conferences on the history of aerospace technology, aviation, aerodynamics, spaceflight, space sciences, and aviation and space ar t. Based on their research and expertise, NASM's archives and curatorial staff will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions for the national collections and respond to public inquiries. The Museum will also continue to upgrade exhibitions dealing with aviation and spaceflight, thereby ensuring that current materials remain available to the public. Curators across NASM continue to produc e an average of more than 50 publications each year, many award -winning. For example, t he book Operation Moonglow , by curator Teasel Muir -Harmony , won the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics ' Eugene M. Emme Astronautical Literature Award . Other significant publications by NASM scholars in FY 202 2 included Flying Camelot: The F -15, the F -16, and the Weaponization of Fighter Pilot Nostalgia , by Michael Hankins , and The Wind and Beyond: A Documentary Journey into the History of Aerodynamics in America , Volume III , co-edited by Jeremy Kinney . NASM historical research also appeared in important journal s, including curator Michael Neufeld 's article s in Quest: The History of Spaceflight Quarterly and the Journal of Educational Media, Memory, and Society . 48 Digital, Social Media, and Media \u2014 The Museum continues to expand its use of digital and social media outreach to share educational, collections , and research information with the public and encourage their engagement with online assets, as well as to visit NASM and participate in its programs and events. Across all platforms, the number of Museum followers increased by more than 13 percent in FY 2022, with continued strong engagement per post. Website visits topped six million. In FY2023, the Mu seum continue d develop ing its analytic data to deliver targeted content to students, teachers , and other key audiences to ensure they have access to NASM's educational resources and provide timely information on visitation and programs. The Museum also en gages consistently with local, national , and international media to ensure potential visitors are aware of the collections, educational offerings, research findings , and NASM events. During FY 2023, those efforts generated more than 20,000 print and online stories , with a potential audience impression numbering in the tens of billions. Management \u2014 In FY 2022, the Smithsonian named a new permanent director of NASM who is supported by a seven -member senior leadership team. The team advance s tactical objectives to achieve the goals of the Museum's FY 2020 -2025 strategic plan: Expanding Our Universe . NASM is implementing this plan by moving to a hybrid work environment , with telework -eligible employees splitting time between their duty stations and telework sites. Management decisions are rooted in cost -effective and responsive administration to make the most out of the opportunities from revitalizing and transforming the NMB. The Museum also continues to pursue the goals of the Diversity, Equity, Accessibility, and Inclusion (DEAI) strategic implementation plan to ensure that the NASM reflects the population of the United States and the world. To assist with these efforts, the Museum has chartered an E mployee Resource Group to give a voice to employees and enlist them as partners in DEAI efforts. The Museum has also reviewed and improved its r ecruitment and hiring practices to ensure that hiring panels are diverse and interviews include DEAI -related questions. NASM continues to widen candidate searches to better reach under - served populations , provide curriculum and programming to support a more inclusive environment , and work with a DEAI content lead for the exhibition program. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes an increase of $ 1,025 ,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff funded in this line item. 49 NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 General trust funds support research, education, exhibitions, and fund raising, including salaries and benefits. Donor/sponsor -designated funds support costs related to specific programs and projects. A $250 million campaign to support the transformation of the NMB and the reimagination of the 23 exhibits and presentation spaces is under way, with $240 million already secured. The Museum received the largest gift since the Smithsonian's founding when Jeff Bezos donated $200 million , approximately $70 million of which will fund part of the trans formation efforts (included in the $240 million shown above). The remainder of the Bezos gift, $130 million, will fund education programs and the building of the B LC. Private support is also used to fund educational initiatives and public programs, as well as to apply for Government grants and contracts which support research and other scientific activities. However, the extended closures of the NMB and the UHC due to the COVID -19 pandemic continue to have a significant effect on NASM's reduced private -sector revenue stream and will impa ir programming and operations at the Museum for years to come. 50 SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 7 5,851 237 79,003 1 237 FY 202 3 ENACTED 88 26,412 92 24,475 7 6,096 237 79,003 1 249 FY 202 4 REQUEST 90 27,844 92 24,475 7 5,851 237 79,003 1 249 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage research and discovery 81 20,865 82 21,854 1 989 Education Provide education support to engage and inspire diverse audiences0 0 1 187 1 187 Public Programs Provide relevant reference services and disseminate information to the public 1 220 1 230 0 10 Facilities Operations and Maintenance Improve facilities operations and provide a safe and healthy environment 0 3,172 0 3,369 0 197 Security Provide world-class protection for Smithsonian facilities, collections, staff, visitors and volunteers 1 230 1 230 0 0 Management Operations Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure 5 1,680 5 1,729 0 49 Information Technology Improve the Institution's information technology systems and infrastructure 0 245 0 245 0 0 Total 88 26,412 90 27,844 21,432Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change 51 BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT Founded in 1890, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory ( SAO ) is the largest and most diverse astrophysical research institution in the world. SAO has helped develop some of the world's most powerful and sophisticated astronomical instruments, with high resolution at wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum. Alone or in long -standing partnerships with the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Department of Energy, it has pioneered the development of orbiting observatories and large, ground -based te lescopes; the application of computers to study astrophysical problems; and the integration of laboratory measurements and theoretical astrophysics. Observational data are gathered at SAO's premier facilities: the Submillimeter Array (SMA) in Hawaii; the 6 .5-meter -diameter Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT ); the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) in Chile ; and the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) in Arizona; as well as the specialized telescopes at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory. SAO also conducts research with a broad range of powerful instruments aboard rockets, balloons, and spacecraft (most notably, the Chandra X -ray Observatory, the Solar Dynamics Observatory, and the Parker Solar Probe ), and at locations as diver se as the high plateaus of northern Chile and the Amundsen South Pole Station. Headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, SAO collaborates with the Harvard College Observatory to form the Center for Astrophysics Harvard and Smithsonian. SAO's mission is to : (1) advance the public's knowledge and understanding of the universe through research and education in astronomy and astrophysics ; and (2) be of service to the national and international astronomical communities, and to society in general, i n areas associated with our primary mission. SAO directly supports the Smithsonian Strategic Plan goal to \" Harness the Smithsonian's expertise to elevate science in the global discourse.\" SAO's research is unique and world -renowned because of the strengt h and diversity of its observers, theorists, instrument developers, engineers, and laboratory scientists, and because SAO emphasizes multiple strategies which draw from the strengths of both small projects and large research centers, including NASA flagshi p missions. Indeed, SAO's extraordinary research success is partly the result of the rich cross -fertilization among its outstanding scientists and engineers in a climate that nurtures collaborative excellence, the sharing of ideas, and the building of cutting-edge telescope instrumentation. For decades, SAO astronomers and their colleagues have made revolutionary discoveries which have changed our fundamental understanding of the universe and our place in it. We have discovered and examined planets in orbits around other stars, watched as new stars are born, and found bizarre remnants of dead stars that emit vast quantities of x-rays. We have determined that the universe is 13.7 billion years old, and that it is populated with billions of galaxies, most of which have supermassive black holes at their centers. We have found convincing 52 evidence that most matter in the universe is a n unexpected mixture of some kind of mysterious \"dark matter,\" with normal matter making up less than four percent of the total; and that the expansion of the universe is apparently accelerating, driven by a mysterious and invisible \"dark energy.\" At the s ame time, SAO astronomers conduct the vital basic research that seeks to understand the sun and ex plain its x-ray- emitting corona, the nature of our solar system, the abundant elements in our Milky Way Galaxy, the gas and dust between the stars, the format ion and evolution of galaxies, and the large -scale structure of the universe. Today, SAO continues to use advanced technologies to make new discoveries which will tell a coherent story of the cosmos from the Big Bang to the origins of life on Earth. SAO h as an extraordinary record in developing and successfully implementing large, complex, and innovative observational and theoretical research projects. Additionally, SAO carries out investigative research performed by individual researchers and small groups . This broad range of activities creates the distinctive, fertile research environment that drives SAO's success and makes it a recognized global leader in astrophysics. No event better illustrates the strength of SAO's science than the extraordinary imag es of supermassive black holes caught by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) in 2019 and 2022. The EHT team was led by SAO astronomer Dr. Sheperd Doeleman and many of the key sub - elements were led by junior scientists at SAO. Hundreds of researchers from the United States, Europe, and Asia contributed to this project under SAO's leadership. SAO now leads the Next Generation EHT project, which will greatly expand the telescope's capabilities and eventually allow scientists to watch black holes evolve in real t ime. In 2023, SAO will launch and operate the NASA Tropospheric Emissions Monitoring of Pollution ( TEMPO ) satellite, which will conduct hourly monitoring of pollution over the United States . In addition, SAO is developing an education program that will allow students to download and analyze TEMPO data for high-school research projects. In 2022, SAO astronomer Mercedes Lopez -Morales and her team was one of four \"tiger teams\" that used data from the new James Webb Space Telescope to detect carbon dioxide in a planet outside our solar system, for the first time. 53 Building on its recent record of success, SAO is now embarking on a major new mission to deliver instrumentation for the Giant Magellan Telescope. With unmatched image quality, seven of the world's largest mirrors will work in concert to collect unprecedented images of the farthest reaches of the universe. The Giant Magellan Telescope will unveil the stars and galaxies in the infant univer se just after the Big Bang, help us understand the nature of dark matter and dark energy through gravitational lensing, and reveal the presence of oxygen in extrasolar planet atmospheres for the first time, allowing us to distinguish between planets that m ay harbor life and planets without life. SAO is building the following three instruments for the Giant Magellan Telescope on behalf of the U .S. astronomical community: GMT \u2014 Consortium Large Earth Finder ( G-CLEF ): A high-precision spectrograph to detect O 2 on extrasolar planets, and the only spectrograph of its type for decades ; Acquisition, Guiding and Wavefront Sensing System ( AGWS ): An innovative sensor system to keep the telescope mirrors aligned so that light from distant stars and planets will be sharp ; and GMT \u2014 Multi -object Astronomical and Cosmological Spectrograph (GMACS ): A transformative wide-area spectrograph to detect light from the first galaxies in the universe. These instruments will be available for the entire U .S. astronomical community to drive new discoveries on behalf of the Amer ican public . SAO aims to have G -CLEF ready and tested before its commissioning on the Giant Magellan Telescope. 54 MEANS AND STRATEGY SAO scientists make optimal use of various astronomical facilities, including the ground -based optical and radio telescopes owned and operated by SAO in Arizona and Hawaii, and space -based telescopes, most notably the Chandra X -ray Observatory, which is op erated by SAO on behalf of NASA. SAO scientists also have research access to the two 6.5 -meter Magellan telescopes in northern Chile through a partnership with the Harvard College Observatory. SAO scientists and engineers are leading the science operations team and using the VERITAS telescope to carry out a vital scientific research program in very high -energy astrophysics. These facilities enable SAO scientists to make substantial progress in answering basic questions about the origin and nature of the uni verse, including efforts to learn more about dark energy and dark matter, as well as questions about the formation and evolution of the Earth and similar planets. In addition, SAO scientists will continue their work on future space missions, collaborating with NASA and its research centers on missions to study the sun, the x-ray universe, and the outer solar system. SAO collaborates with Taiwan's Academia Sinica, Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, to establish radio observatories in Greenland. A 12 -meter -diameter telescope was delivered to Thule in 2016 and came online in 2018. Plans are being developed to move the telescope to Sum mit Station, the NSF's site high on the ice plateau. These additional capabilities will play a crucial ro le in enabling new, more detailed , next-generation Event Horizon Telescope observations of our neighbor ing galaxy M87, which can produce a \"black -hole cinema\" to help us better understand how black holes grow and feed from their surrounding stars and gas. The Astro2020 Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics ranked the U.S. Extremely Large Telescope Program, including the Giant Magellan Telescope, as its top priority for U .S. ground -based astronomy. SAO is a founding partner in the Giant Magellan Telescope. As one of 14 partners, including Harvard, the University of Texas at Austin, Carnegie Observatories, the University of Arizona, Arizona State University, the University of Chicago, Texas A&M, and the Australian National University , SAO is helping to build t he GMT instruments with additional funding from partner institutions, which is normal for large telescope projects. SAO's role reflects its status as one of the nation's leading engineering programs and is why SAO has been chosen to bu ild more Giant Magellan Telescope instruments than any other U .S. organization. In addition to helping develop telescope instrumentation, SAO scientists take a leadership role in astrophysics by participating in or hosting national and international co nferences (e.g., the American Astronomical Society, the International Astronomical Union, and the Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems conference series), by participating as keynote and/or invited speakers at such meetings, and by serving on a diverse range of astronomical and astrophysical review panels. SAO scientists also continue to publish in leading peer-reviewed journals, such as the Astrophysical Journal , the Astronomical 55 Journal , and Astronomy & Astrophysics . In addition, SAO developed and operates the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS), which is recognized as a world leader in the dissemination of scientific literature about the cosmos. SAO scientists lead and contribute to nationwide education and outreach programs, including the micro -observatory program that allows students worldwide to control robotic telescopes and design and conduct astronomy experiments. SAO will expand its nationwide education reach with the launch of the TEMPO satellite by developing a telescopes -in-schools program, targeting rural and underprivileged schools ac ross the country, and with an astronomer -in-residence program at the Smithsonian 's National Air and Space Museum (NASM) . Supporting SAO's information technology (IT) infrastructure to ensure it is robust, reliable, and secure remains a priority. Additiona lly, SAO is committed to maintaining a cooperative environment via communication s and activities which underscore SAO's special mission and each staff member's contribution to its success; evaluating managers and supervisors on their compliance with applicable equal opportunity laws, rules, and regulations, and on the effectiveness of their efforts to achieve a diverse workforce ; and facilitat ing the use of small, minority, and women -owned businesses in its procurement operations and business relation ships to the maximum extent practicable. These proven management approaches will continue to support and enhance SAO's scientific and educational missions. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes a total increase of $1, 432,000 that provides $861,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff funded under this line item , and an increase of $197,000 to cover increased rental costs for current federal ly leased space , which is also referenced in the Fixed Costs section of this budget submission. The request also includes a programmatic increase of 2 FTEs and $374,000 as described below. Education Support (+$187,000, +1 FTE) An important new initiative in FY 2024 is to implement an ambitious new education and outreach program at SAO . This budget request seeks an increase of 1 FTE to hire an SAO education program manager to drive this effort. This position will develop and manage a nationwide telescope s-in-schools program called Smithsonian Telescopes and Astronomy in Regional Schools ( STARS ) and an astronomer -in-residence (AIR) program at the NASM . STARS will provide portable , computerized Schmidt -Cassegrain telescopes, teacher training , and student project s to high-school students in rural and regional schools in the United States to enhance student engagement in science and technology in underserved areas. AIR will bring SAO astronomers (based in Boston) to Washington , DC to share their science with school children and the public through an ongoing residency program at the NASM . 56 Scientific Research (+$187,000, +1 FTE) The budget request also includes an increase of $187,000 and 1 FTE for a manufacturing engineer position at the SAO to help oversee the develop ment and assembly of the G -CLEF instrument and play a key role in commissioning the instrument. Specifically, the position will conduct surveys with GMT pathfinder instruments and the MMT and Magellan telescopes and collaborate with scientists to fully exploit the use of the G-CLEF instrument . The G -CLEF will enter a multi -year integration period beginning in December 2023. This period requires increased coordination as well as tooling and fixturing to enable these parts to be carefully assembled into the G -CLEF instrument. These multi -year preparations are essentia l to the overall SAO science program and the instruments that SAO is developing. To fully maximize the discoveries with next-generation telescopes, these scientific preparations require several years of lead time prior to the telescope becoming operational. NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 General trust funds come primarily from overhead charged on grants and contracts. SAO uses these funds to support administrative functions approved in the Indirect Cost Proposal submitted to the Department of the Interior, as required by 2 Code of Federal R egulations 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards. Donor/sponsor -designated funds come primarily from restricted gifts from individuals, foundations, and corporations, which are earmarked for specific purposes; restricted endowment funds; and non -Governmental grants and contracts. Government grants and contracts come from Government agencies for research in areas of SAO's expertise. SAO often conducts this research in cooperation with governmenta l, academic, and research institutions in the United States and abroad. 57 MAJOR SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 4,118 0 0 0 0 0 0 FY 2023 ENACTED 0 4,118 0 0 0 0 0 0 FY 202 4 REQUEST 0 4,731 0 0 0 0 0 0 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage research and discovery 0 4,118 0 4,731 0 613 Total 0 4,118 0 4,731 0 613Salaries and Expenses ($'s in thousands) Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 ChangeFederal Resources by Performance Objective and Program Category BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's (SAO) work directly supports the Smithsonian Strategic Plan's goal to \"Harness the Smithsonian's expertise to elevate science in the global discourse.\" SAO contributes to advancing knowledge and is at the forefront of humanity 's quest to understand the universe. SAO 's strength in observational astrophysics relies on its major ground -based facilities: the Submillimeter Telescope Array ( SMA ), the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT), the Magellan Telescope, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA ) space -based facilities, including the Chandra X -ray Observatory, the new James Webb Space Telescope, the Parker Solar Probe, and the upcoming Tropospheric Emissions Monitoring of Pollution ( TEMPO ) satellite. Access to both ground -and space - based observatories enables SAO scientists to conduct research that would be impossible with either type of observatory alone. SAO's future strength in ground -based observationa l astrophysics depends on developing specialized instruments and facilities which do not yet exist. A team of talented scientists and engineers must devise these tools with support from multiyear MSI funding. Continued federal support makes this leadership possible. 58 The Smithsonian uses its no -year funding from the Major Scientific Instrumentation (MSI) line item to develop large -scale instrumentation projects with advanced technologies which enable SAO scientists to remain at the leading edge of astronomy and astrophysics research. The Smithsonian's criteria for proposing and selecting MSI projects are: 1) the instrumentation will enable compelling scientific advances that would not otherwise occur (either at SAO or anywhere else in the world) for some tim e to come; 2) the instrumentation is novel , technically advanced, and would not be developed without SAO's contribution; and 3) the science enabled by the innovative instruments would significantly advance the Smithsonian 's Strategic Plan. The fundamental role for federal appropriations is to support the basic scientific infrastructure that enables SAO to conduct research, compete for external grants and funding, publish articles in peer -reviewed journals, and inform and e ducate the public about the latest scientific discoveries in an exciting and compelling manner. The magnitude of the costs involved, and the long timeline required to fabricate major new instruments and reconfigure existing ones , require that MSI funds for t hese projects be kept available until they are spent. Innovative instrumentation has enabled Smithsonian astronomers to make fundamental discoveries about the universe. Today, SAO scientists use advanced technologies to tell a coherent story of the cosmos from the Big Bang to the origins of life on Earth. MSI funds are used to meet this objective. Three SAO projects are included in the FY 202 4 MSI line item: the Greenland Telescope; the SMA on Mauna Kea, Hawaii; and the work being done at the MMT in Arizona, as well as the advanced telescope instrumentation for the GMT and the Magellan Clay Telescope located at the Las Campanas Observatory in northern Chile. MEANS AND STRATEGY SAO's mission is to engage in astrophysical research and discovery. Observational astrophysics is the basic science responsible for understanding the universe and its components beyond Earth. SAO has contributed to many key discoveries in astrophysics, including: 1) the remarkable discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating; 2) the discovery of enormous filamentary patterns traced by galaxies in the universe; 3) the most compelling demonstration of the existence of supermassive black holes at the centers of most galaxies; 4) the discovery of very high -energy gamma rays; 5) the most convincing observational evidence for the existence of dark matter; 6) the discovery of planets orbiting other stars and carbon dioxide in the atmospheres of those planet s; and 7) the spectacular image of the supermassive black hole at the center of our own Milky Way and our neighbor ing galaxy M87, released by the SAO -led EHT team. SAO scientists contributed to these dis coveries by using key facilities that enable observations in several different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e., the broad range of light emitted by shining objects in the universe). 59 SAO's pre -eminence in the field is underscored by the promin ent role its scientists take in the consideration and establishment of national policy for astrophysics. SAO scientists participated in the National Academies of Science Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics as members of science definition teams an d topical panels. In addition, SAO offers key advice and reviews to NASA for the recently deploy ed James Webb Space Telescope. Advanced Telescope Instrumentation for the Optical Telescopes ($2,613,100) SAO 's expertise in building large and powerful instruments is a crucial capability in the era of extremely large telescopes. Continued MSI funding will enable SAO to conduct this research and maintain the United States' lead in this important scientific field. SAO leads the design, developmen t, and manufacture of the GMT -Consortium Large Earth Finder (or G -CLEF). G -CLEF will search for planets that are \"Earth Twins\" orbiting other stars, and for evidence of life on those planets. G -CLEF is the only instrument in development that can detect si gns of biological activity (life) in exoplanet atmospheres. In FY 2024, MSI funds will be used to continue designing G -CLEF and develop prototypes of the high -risk subsystems needed to use the instrument to its full potential. MSI funds will also help prepare G -CLEF for testing on the 6.5 -meter Magellan Clay Telescope in Chile . SAO's ability to use the Clay Telescope for this purpose is funded and facilitated by its partnership with the Harvard College Observatory. The MMT, a joint project of SAO and the University of Arizona, dedicated in 1979, was originally made up of six identical 1.8 -meter telescopes in a single altitude -azimuth (naval -gun-type) mount. In the 1990s, SAO and the University of Arizona replaced the six smaller mirrors of the original MMT with a single mirror 6.5 meters in diameter. This large mirror more than doubled the light -gathering capacity of the telescope, and a set of large corrector lenses, built with MSI funding, has since increased its field of view 400 times. The MMT is a sup erb platform on which to develop innovative technologies for the new generation of extremely large telescopes such as the GMT. Accordingly, SAO scientists are developing novel instrumentation to validate and optimize the underlying concepts before similar GMT -scale instruments are constructed. Greenland Telescope ($500,000) The Greenland Telescope, located in Thule, Greenland at the U.S. Air Force Base, was originally a National Science Foundation (NSF) prototype for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The Greenland Telescope was transferred to SAO from NSF Astronomy and retrofitted for cold -weather operation by SAO's partner insti tution, the Academia Sinica Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) in Taiwan. 60 These investments by the NSF and our Taiwanese collaborators are greatly enhanced by the SAO contribution, making the project an excellent opportunity to capitalize on a highly leveraged use of federal funds with high -value science returns on the investment. The Greenland Telescope serves as the northernmost node of the EHT network, operated jointly with SAO's SMA (in Hawaii), the international ALMA telescope array (in Chile), and other telescopes, to make unprecedented observations of the event horizon of the supermassive black hole at the heart of the giant galaxy M87 (M87*). The telescope will continue to be a key resource for new observations of M87* and potentially o ther black holes. SAO worked with the NSF Division of Polar Programs to identify a high, dry, northern site on the Greenland ice sheet as the ideal place for high -frequency radio astronomical observations that require excellent atmospheric transmission and exceptional atmospheric stability. As part of its contribution to this project, t he NSF is redeveloping the Greenland Summit Station to better conduct this research. Submillimeter Telescope Array ($1,617,900) The SMA is a pathfinder telescope that operat es between radio and infrared wavelengths to better explor e the cool universe. In recent years, scientific studies have continued to focus on the study of the distant universe, planet -forming disks, and star formation. The SMA is also a key element of the EHT, as discussed above. SAO scientists and engineers are dramatically improving the sensitivity of the SMA and enabling remarkabl e wideband capabilities to obtain comprehensive molecular inventories of star -forming regions to shed light on the origin of c omplex organic molecules. Continued improvement to the SMA's sensitivity, imaging, and studies of transient phenomena depend on upgrading the telescope instrumentation that receives and processes the incoming signals using innovative technologies. The upgrades highly leverage the infrastructure investment in the antennas and at the site. With continued MSI funding, SAO is building and testing new wideband receiver sets at its labs in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Once all eight SMA antennas have been equipped with the new receiver sets, the sensitivity of the SMA will be increased by more than a factor of 20 since the SMA was commissioned nearly two decades ago. Its instantaneous frequency coverage will be wider than that of any other radio telescope. 61 EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes a total increase of $613,000. This programmatic increase is an investment to fully develop G -CLEF, a high-precision spectrograph to detect oxygen molecules on habitable planets outside our solar system. G-CLEF will be the only instrument of its type for decades. With this funding, G -CLEF will be completed and installed on the 6.5 -meter Magellan Clay Telescope. The G -CLEF instrument on Magellan will allow SAO to detect molecular oxygen on an extrasolar planet for the first time. G -CLEF is a flexible and adaptable instrument, allowing it to be installed on many telescopes worldwide , including Magellan and the GMT . Funding G -CLEF will enable SAO to make tremendous advance s in humankind's understanding of our universe and the uniqueness of our planet Earth. 62 NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED 6 2,522 11 4,150 47 15,300 7 2,700 11 1,190 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage research and discovery 88 18,795 88 19,573 0 778 Digital Transformation Provide improved digitization and audience engagement 4 547 4 569 0 22 Education Provide education support to engage and inspire diverse audiences 11 1,915 11 1,994 0 79 Public Programs Provide relevant reference services and disseminate information to the public 42 7,694 42 8,013 0 319 Exhibitions Offer compelling, first-class exhibitions 26 3,917 26 4,079 0 162 Collections Improve the stewardship of the national collections 77 16,893 79 18,992 2 2,099 Facilities Operations and Maintenance Improve facilities operations and provide a safe and healthy environment 4 906 4 943 0 37 Security Provide world-class protection for Smithsonian facilities, collections, staff, visitors and volunteers 1 195 1 203 0 8 Management Operations Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure12 1,946 12 2,026 0 80 Information Technology Improve the Institution's information technology systems and infrastructure 12 2,431 12 2,533 0 102 Total 277 55,239 279 58,925 2 3,686Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change 63 BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT The mission of the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) is to understand the natural world and our place in it. We seek to inspire curiosity, discovery, and learning about nature and culture through outstanding research, collections, exhibitions, and education. Building upon our unique and vast collections and associated data, field research stations, specialized laboratorie s, and an internationally recognized team of scien ce researchers , the Museum staff and the knowledge they generate serve a wide range of constituencies from various federal agencies to the public. NMNH scien tific research focuses broadly on discovering, documenting, and understanding biodiversity; studying the formation and evolution of the Earth and other planets; exploring human diversity and cultural change; and investigating evolutionary patterns and processes throughout the history of li fe on Earth . This research is closely linked to important societal issues such as global climate change, biodiversity loss, cultural conflict, environmental justice, invasive species, and man-made and natural hazards. In terms of reputation, NMNH science has worldwide impact and is often cited by the greater scientific community. Our researchers discover new species and document and analyze how species arise, evolve, persist, diversify, and interact with each other and with the environment, as well as how they migrate and go extinct. Our Earth and planetary scientists contribute to understanding of our world's history as well as the effects of geologic and meteoritic phenomena on Earth's atmosphere and biosphere. They st udy the dynamic planet we inhabit in all its aspects, from its surface to its core. NMNH anthropologists use collections and field -based studies to help understand the continually evolving story of our species and our interactions with other life and with the planet. Our staff also translate science to society through their diverse and dedicated outreach efforts and invest heavily in training and mentoring the next generation of new scientists. Our physical collection , consisting of more than 148 million specimens and objects , and our collections expertise are at the core of the Museum's mission a s well as fundamental to science. The scope and breadth of the NMNH collections provide a vast research infrastructure that su pports the scientific mission. The Museum's scientists work with their professional colleagues in the United States and around the world to further build and draw on these collections , make new discoveries , and test new theories. NMNH collections also represent a valuable historical archive in their own right , since they document billions of years of planetary, geological, organismal, and cultural change s. As part of a larger Smithsonia n initiative , the Muse um focuses on the ethical use s of collections, particularly those related to humans , in light of changes involving current societal considerations and concerns about equity and respect for diverse cultures and traditions . NMNH collections provide vital information and are a dynamic resource used by researchers, educators, and policy makers worldwide. They serve as essential reference materials fo r U.S. Government agencies. These resources are used by staff 64 members for the Departments of Defense, Commerce, and Agriculture, who are housed in NMNH facilities. For example, tens of thousands of insects urgently requi ring identification are sent to the Museum from U.S. ports of entry each year. Scientists at the Department of Agriculture and the NMNH consult the collections and rapidly provide identifications to border control agencies so that American agricultural and economic interests are kept se cure from damage by potential ly invasive species. NMNH collections also serve repository functions for agencies such as the National Cancer Institute , the Depar tment of the Interior, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ). The FBI als o uses the Museum's human skeletal collections to assist in its criminal investigations. NMNH's first -class research and collections are at the heart of its exhibitions and educational outreach. As one of the most visited museums in the world prior to the COVID -19 pandemic , the NMNH provides diverse public audiences with presentations on every aspect of life on Earth. Through its many affiliations and partnerships, the Museum takes its science exhibitions and public programs to other instituti ons and non-traditional exhibition venues, such as libraries, parks, schools, and universities across the country. With a growing body of digital data, network of interactive websites (which host more than 12 million unique visitors annually ), distance -learning experiences, and social media, the NMNH is transforming itself into a t rue digital classroom that is accessible to everyone \u2014 free of charge . MEANS AND STRATEGY During the next four years, the Museum will continue implement ing its strategic plan \u2014 Our World, Our Future . At the heart of this plan is a recognition that the NMNH plays a central role in tackling some of the biggest issues of our time by using its research, outreach, and collective efforts to inspire and train the n ext generation of natural history scientists. Through this effort , the Museum will align itself with broader Smithsonian objectives and embrace NMNH's potential as a conven er of national and international conversations, reaching Americans in their own communities through a more visible digital presence, and seizing opportunities to partner with other Smithsonian units to strengthen our collective impact on the public . The Museum's strategic plan is centered around the following four \"Big Idea\" initiatives which are supported with a combination of federal and private funding : Our Unique Planet will combine NMNH Earth science assets and a NASA mission to understand the origin of the Earth's oceans, continents, and the geologic conditions that allowed for the evolution of life on our planet . The Ocean Science Center will consolidate the Museum's vast marine portfo lio and create a n array of new tools, techniques , and collections to measure marine biodiversity more accurately and rapidly . Our World will be an immersive Museum experience that uses big data and stunning visualizations to drive home the reality , impact , and urgency of the 65 current climate and biodiversity crises we face while focusing on success stories to help visitors understand the opportunities for positive outcomes. The Inclusive Science Initiative will focus on youth from underserved communities and under -represented groups and train them to be the next generation of scientists and science -savvy citizens. On this last point , NMNH has a long history of training future scientists. In FY 2024, the Museum will continue combining federal a nd private funding to invest in the next generation of young scientists and researchers , with an emphasis on opportunities for individuals from diverse backgrounds . Through NMNH academic programs, the Museum will continue creat ing a staircase of academic opportunity to mentor the next generation of scientists and professionals. These programs take students and young professionals from the early stages of scientific exploration in high school to the postdoctoral peak of stepping int o the role of professional researchers , by offering various Fellowship and internship programs for undergraduates, graduates, and postgraduates. NMNH is committed to the stewardship of its scientif ic collections . These resources play an important federal role in public health and safety, homeland security, trade and economic development, medical research, and environmental monitoring. They also provide the foundation for the Museum's diverse research, exhibits, and public outreach programs. The NMNH will continue its strong commitment to cutting - edge research and state -of-the-art stewardship of the collections, in partnership with the Departments of Defense, Commerce, Agriculture, and the Interior. Significantly, federal funding is the keystone for maintaining and preserving these priceless collections and their valuable information for future generations, while also supporting their use for ongoing research. The Museum's collections ar e the bedrock of its scientific enterprise. That is why the scientific research staff is organized into seven departments: anthropology ; botany ; entomology ; mineral sciences ; invertebrate zoology ; paleobiology ; and vertebrate zoology. NMNH programs address current topics, such as biological diversity, global climate change, molecular systematics to better understand the relationship s between living things, ecosystem modeling , and the documentation and preservation of human cultural heritages. In 202 2, the Museum's scientific st aff authored more than 720 scholarly publications . On an annual basis, they typically contribute to the discovery and description of hundreds of species new to science . In FY 2024, the NMNH will continue to maintain and upgrad e permanent exhibitions ; replac e outdated exhibits with multidisciplinary, interactive exhibitions on the Mall ; improv e public access to the Museum's resources through DIY (Do -It- Yourself) exhibits ; and expand our digital reach across the country. The Museum's most significant and substantial multiyear project (FY 2023 into FY 2026) is The People and Nature Experience . Encompassing nearly 10,000 square feet on the building 's second floor, the Experience combine s exhibits and interactives with an awe -inspiring , multimedi a immersive zone to thrill people with the wonders of our natural world, imbue them with hope that by working together we can help our 66 fragile earth revive, and connect them with the means to get involved in doing such work. Made possible through substantial philanthropic support, the Experience and its associated on -site and online programming focus on the youth of America, and their parents, teachers , and advocate s. Three special exhibitions that opened in FY 2023 will continue into or through FY 2024. Barro Colorado Island: 100 Years of Discoveries and Wonder was developed by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) to celebrate the centennial of the Barro Colorado Island Research Station in Panama, the most intensively studied tropical forest in the world. For the past century , this island has drawn scientists from around the globe who study everything from microbes to towering trees. Barro Colorado is the oldest active research station in the American tropics and has been described as one of the Smithsonian's \"jewels in the crown.\" In March of 2023 , the Museum open ed Lights Out: Recovering Our Night Sky . Developed in conjunction with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) and with contributions from NASA, Lights Out explore s how the sight of the night sky \u2014 and its disappearance due to light pollution \u2014 affect s all life on Earth, from natural ecosystems to human cultures. Featuring stunning images of the night skies from around the world and revealing images of our over -lit Earth as seen from space, Lights Out shows visitors what steps they can take in the ir homes and communities to lessen light pollution and re -connect with the dazzling night show in the skies above. In June of 2023 , the Museum will launch the long -awaited exhibition Cellphone: Unseen Connections , a youth -oriented investigation into the often -surprising connections between the natural world and the fastest -growing and most widespread technology in human history. Made possible with a combination of feder al funding and corporate support, Cellphone combines displays of natural specimens and technological and cultural artifacts with innovative media interactives to tell a rich story about the environmental and societal impacts of that ubiquitous device in our pockets. Varied on-site and digital educational programming will extend the exhibit's impact into schools and communities nationwide. The Museum's groundbreaking DIY program offers bilingual print-on-demand poster version s of popular exhibit s, which are free to schools, community centers, libraries , and clinics around the world and will expand to five exhibits in FY 2024. Our pilot project, the DIY version of Outbreak: Epidemics in a Connected World , has been displayed in more than 55 countries and 47 U .S. states and territories . Dig It! The Secrets of Soil and Genome: Unlocking Life's Code came next, followed by Exploring Human Origins in FY 2023, and finally Cellphone: Unseen Connections that will be available in FY 2024. The COVID -19 pandemic that closed the Museum to the public required making significant adjustments to the special exhibits calendar, but NMNH has since welcomed visitors back with a full offering of exhibitions and collections on display . In FY 2024 , the Museum will continue to inspire public appreciation of , and engagement with , science and the natural world through efforts in our education, outreach , and visitor experience programs. Ever mindful of public access , the NMNH 67 will contin ue improv ing the accessibility of exhibits and programs and reach underserved audiences and visitors from under -represented communities. In FY 2024 , NMNH will study the effectiveness of its programs and activities and how they impact audiences, both at the Museum and nation wide. These studies will include evaluative as well as research -based inquiries which can inform learning about science, technology, engineer ing, and mathematics (STEM) topics. The Museum is also using a system known as ISEE (informal STEM education evaluation) , developed by NMNH with its partner , the Center of Science and Industry (COSI) in Columbus, Ohio, to measure informal -education outcome s and institutional impact within and across organizations. The system was developed with support from the National Science Foundation. In addition, Q?rius, The Coralyn W. Whitney Science Education Center \u2014 the Museum's interactive STEM learning facility \u2014 continues bring ing NMNH research and collections to visitors and learners . Q?rius programs inspire, nurture, grow, and diversify the next generation of STEM professionals by helping citizens become aware of their connection to curr ent issues affecting the natural and cultural world. In FY 2024 , the Museum will launch a Web-based app lication for visitors' phones to give audiences more control over their own learning experience s as they explore the education collections within Q?rius. In FY 202 4, in-person, on -site, interactive learning experiences at the Museum will continue with p rograms such as \"The Expert Is In\" series and special events such as Teen Earth Optimism, Natio nal Fossil Day, and the World and Me. These programs provide opportunities for the public and NMNH science experts to come together and discuss natural history and science topics . During the pandemic , NMNH educators acquired new insights into teacher and student needs and adjusted the Museum's digital education strategy by developing nine transmedia bundles , which are collections of digital experiences and content resources, each thematically aligned to core science concepts and skills . Each bundled collection is anchored with a digital school program, which is a standards -aligned school program delivered by NMNH educators directly to individual classrooms or groups of classes by grade level within schools. They also include live Smithsonian Science webinars to connect students with a Smithsonian scientist who will talk with them about natural history science research. The content aligns with the Smithsonian 's \"Life on a Sustainable Planet\" initiative and Next Generation Science Standards. In school year 2021 -2022, more than 1,000 of these school programs were delivered to 32,000 students nationwide. Additional Museum o utreach activities will include traveling exhibitions, the Ocean Portal and Human Origins websites , and the Encyclopedia of Life , as well as digitized collections and longstanding programs of lectures and films. These NMNH programs and resources will continue to inspire audience s by making them aware of current issues related to the natural and cultura l world, helping them understand their role as citizens in addressing those issues, and providing experiences to inspire stewardship, conservation, and protection of natural and cultural 68 diversity. In addition, Museum staff are reaching new youth audiences and increas ing youth participation in a continuum of opportunities to inspire, nurture, grow, and diversify the next generation of STEM professionals. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 202 4 budget request includes an increase of $3,686,000 that provides $2,286,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff funded under this line item, as well as a programmatic increase of 2 FTEs and $ 1,400,000 for collections steward ship. Collections S tewardship (+$1,400 ,000, + 2 FTEs) The NMNH requests $1,400,000 and 2 FTEs to launch a Shared Stewardship and Ethical Returns program for implementing one of the Secretary 's top priorities in the recently released Shared Stewardship and Ethical Returns Policy of 2022. Th is program will be the cornerstone in the Museum's future collections stewardship actions and directly support the Secretary's Ethical Returns Policy by address ing ethical issues embedded in the NMNH 's collections. The program will resolve these ethical issues by: 1) ensuring the ethical return of cultural material, as well as biological or geological material , when appropriate ; 2) reproduc ing object s in the Museum's collections; 3) enabling the digital retu rn of archival or other records ; and 4) shar ing stewardship in accordance with the Secretary's policy . The program will operate on a global scale , working with cultural heritage and other materials. The Shared Stewardship and Ethical Returns program will help the Smithsonian address the legacies of colonialism and power imbalances inherent in museum collections obtained during the 19th and early 20th centuries. This program will strengthen the position of the Smithsonian as a global leader and effective collaborat or by acknowledging the rights of communities that have been traditionally overlooked, leading to better cultural understanding and increased relevance for all the Institution's museums. Investment in this program will bolster the NMNH's role as a trusted source of ethical guidance for the museum community, which is a top Smithsonian priority. The program 's mission directly relates to diversity and inclusivity by restoring cultural heritage and other materials obtained during an era of colonialism and pronounced power imbalance s. However, w ithout significant investments in funding and staff to implement this program , it will not be possible to meet policy requirem ents. The Museum's c urrent resources are fully dedicated to Native American and indigenous repatriation within the United States , so the NMNH is at present unable to adequately support a global shared stewardship and ethical returns program without additio nal funding. Simply put, unless these vital resources can be made available, the Museum will not be able to contribute to the Smithsonian Institution 's important strategic initiative of being a trusted source of ethical collections management and stewardsh ip. 69 NONAPPROPRIATE D RESOURCES \u2014 General trust funds support salaries and benefits of administrative personnel, advancement and business activities, and other program -related costs. The Museum raises funds from private sources to support research, exhibitions, public programs, and administrative functions. Donor/sponsor - designated funds are vital to support exhibition hall renovations and offer educational activities and programs. In addition, significant endowment gifts support internship s and Fellowships which introduce more students to the natural sciences, underwrite field research, and help the Museum maintain and expand its educational programs. 70 NATIONAL ZOO AND CONSERVATION BIOLOGY INSTITUTE APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 11,496 6 1,286 FY 20 23 204 35,388 41 12,323 42 10,703 7 1,200 FY 20 24 REQUEST 209 38,279 43 12,627 43 10,883 7 1,300 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage research and discovery 45 4,963 45 5,213 0 250 Education Provide education support to engage and inspire diverse audiences 1 137 1 197 0 60 Exhibitions Offer compelling, first-class exhibitions 88 17,951 88 18,351 0 400 Collections Improve the stewardship of the national collections 61 10,603 66 12,443 51,840 Facilities Operations and Maintenance Improve facilities operations and provide a safe and healthy environment 2 333 2 433 0 100 Management Operations Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure 5 977 5 1,137 0 160 Information Technology Improve the Institution's information technology systems and infrastructure 2 424 2 505 0 81 Total 204 35,388 209 38,279 52,891Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2024 Change BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT In FY 2024, the Smithsonian 's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute (NZCBI) will continue to implement its strategic plan (2020 -2025 ) with the focus for FY 2024, as follows : 71 Enhance Animal Care, Safety , and Sustainability The life, safety , and health of the animals in our care is core to the NZCBI 's mission of \"saving species\" and \"sharing knowledge.\" Federal funding is vital to fully meet the costs for animal care, including increases to comply with new federal requirements and evolving Association of Zoos and Aquariums ' (AZA) accreditation standards, the gold standard in zoological care . In short, federal funds are essential to provide for the basic , minimal needs of the animals in our living collection \u2014 resources t hat cannot be secured through philanthropy, grants , or partnerships. Costs for animal care, drugs and medicines, animal food, as well maintain ing habitats or replac ing and repair ing equipment generally increase faster than t he annual rate of inflation , even with the past year of higher inflation . The health, well -being , and safety of both the animals and staff of the NZCBI are its highest priority. As the science of zoology and aquatic studies grows, so too do accepted standards or best practices for medical care, husbandry, animal welfare and safety for zoo animals. Therefore, zoological facilities must continually im prove in all areas to keep up with rising standards and expectations from regulatory agencies as well as the visiting public. The AZA standards are updated annually and have recent ly focus ed on increasing the requirements for animal welfare by mandating investment in monitoring programs, evaluations , and data collection , and then developing action plans to improve in areas of concern. Additionally, new veterinary medical procedures, diagnostics , and testing require more medical equipment and expertise, and breeding and research protocols to save endangered species from extinction require cutting -edge , sophisticated management approach es to ensure the safety of both animals and staff. When every birth of an endangered ani mal may impact the survival of a species, new and labor - intensive approaches are increasingly needed to provide life -saving veterinary care, medication , and hand -rearing that literally mean the difference between life and death. As our understanding of an imals ' social and behavioral needs increases, so too do the size and complexity of their spaces and monitoring equipment to observe their behavior overnight without the distracting presence of humans . Maintaining appropriate animal habitats requires extens ive investments in their environments to allow for more species -appropriate behaviors and social interactions. With the opening of the new Bird House at the Zoo , the NZCBI team needed to monitor the acclimation of the birds to the newly renovated interior spaces, assess their behavior, and respond to welfare challenges. Similarly, when introducing two pairs of siamangs (a type of arboreal gibbon) to adjacent enclosures, using technology to monitor for indications of territoriality improves the animals' well -being and keeps the staff safe. Finally, the welfare protocols and processes which enhance the safety of both the animals and the people who care for them are rapidly evolving and involve specialized equipment and additional staff to ensure best practice s (e.g., two -person rules for staff working with large, dangerous carnivores; and lock-out/tag -out systems 72 to ensure humans and dangerous animals never unintentionally share space). In addition , the NZCBI works closely with the U.S. Department of Agricultu re (USDA ) to ensure our facilities exceed the requirements of the Animal Welfare Act. As the USDA implement s new requirements related to bird management, the NZCBI will need to make investments to ensure the Bird House is a leader in bird welfare and husbandry. Fortify and Focus Science, Animal Care, and Collections Management to Advance Species Conservation and Sustainability The NZCBI is world -renowned for its efforts to research, care for, breed, and reintroduce some of the world's most critically endangered species. More than 3 70 species are exhibited at the Zoo's Rock Creek Park campus, including giant pandas, Panamanian golden frogs, Sumatran tigers , and Asian elephants. One of the NZCBI's key contributions to ensuring the survival of endangered species is the work at its 3,200 -acre site in Front Royal, Virginia. There, NZCBI staff study and breed more than 20 species, including some \u2014 like black -footed ferrets \u2014 that were once extinct in the wild. Both locations house and care for some of the world's most endangered animals, such as kiwis, clouded leopards, red pandas, and cheetahs, among others. The Great Plains Science Program is a critical area for research at the NZCBI , where staff scientists are helping preserve the northern Great Plains of North America by conducting studies on topics such as restoring bison and reintroducing the swift fox to the environment . NZCBI scientists are developing new and advanced analytical tools to model how ecosystems and species interac t with their environment and how these systems respond to global climate and other changes. Additionally, NZCBI scientists and animal care experts collaborate with colleagues in more than 30 countries , working to identify solutions to threats facing endangered animal populations . That is why the NZCBI staff is known throughout the conservation and zoo community for continually setting high standards for medical care, nutrition, husbandry , reproduction , and safety for zoo animals , and for helping to ensure those standards are adopted by zoos worldwide . Recent accomplishments range from enhancing the sustainability of the North American elephant population and improving safety for keepers of dangerous carnivores to better understandi ng cheetah reproduction and reintroduci ng the scimitar -horned oryx to the wild in Chad . In 2023, the NZCBI reopened the Bird House after more than six years of renovations to the 19 28 structure. Focused on the stories of migratory birds which are native to the United States ' eastern seaboard, the Bird House exhibit explains the loss of more than three billion birds in the last few decade s, immerses visitors in stor ies of the birds ' migration from the East Coast of the United States to the coffee farms of Central America, and provides concrete actions all people can take to help the bird population recover. The positive messages in the Bird House exhibit drive migratory bird conservation efforts through thoughtful and inspiring educa tional outreach. 73 Strengthen Core Foundations of People, Places, and Fiscal Resources for Mission Success During FY 2023, the NZCBI continued to recover from the impacts of lost revenue due to COVID -19-related closures. Global inflation also significantl y impacted the cost s of food, medicines and medical care, and hay production for the living collection, further straining the NZCBI's resources. In addition, the NZCBI is continuing to rebuild critical functions it acquired after the dissolution of an asso ciate d friends ' support organization. MEANS AND STRATEGY The health, well -being , and safety of both the animals and staff of the NZCBI are its highest priority. The NZCBI is world -renow ned for its efforts to research, breed , and reintroduce some of the world 's most critically endangered species, including the scimitar -horned oryx, Przewalski's horse, ferret, red-crowned cranes , and many others. Accepted standards or best industry practices for animal care, husbandry, veterinary medicine , and nutrition for Zoo animals are continually increasing. In addition, the safety standards for the animals, the staff who care for them, and the visiting public are also increas ing. Examples of AZA standar ds which have been recently updated include new requirements for safety monitoring equipment , animal emergency procedures , and animal well -being programs . Besides having to meet existing increased standards and best practices, the NZCBI is struggling to fund new best practices to prevent transmission of zoonotic diseases , such as COVID -19 and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza , as well as cover the higher costs of caring for the animals (e.g., medici ne, vaccines, testing , and personal protective equipment ) and safe operations (e.g., crowd management and permanent changes to cleaning protocols ). EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 202 4 budget request includes an increase of $ 2,891 ,000 that provide s $1,391 ,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff funded under this line item, as well as a programmatic increase of $1,500,000 and 5 FTEs for animal care and management Support (+$1,500,000 , +5 FTEs and +5 FTEs ) to provide specialized support for its living collections, which are critical for inspiring and educati ng the public and saving endangered species from extinction . Unlike the museums within the Smithsonian Institution, the NZCBI cares for living animals, some of which are among the rarest species on Earth. Animals in our care require specialized support to meet certain mandatory standards for species as varied as Asian elephants , giant pandas , black -footed ferrets, endangered cor als, and extinct -in- 74 the-wild frogs. Required s upport ranges from providing adequate shelter, food , and clean, accessible water to providing specialty care for animal breeding or for aged or infirm animals. Despite increase d federal funding in FY 2022 and FY 2023 , the NZCBI still has many unfilled vacancies in essential care positions, including animal keepers, curators, and scientists, as well as shortages in other operational positions such as finance, facility and pest mana gement, and aquatic life support , all of which can directly or indirectly impact the welfare of animals in the NZCBI' s care. Most Smithsonian collections are housed indoors . However, the NZCBI's 163- acre park in Washington, DC and its 3,200 -acre campus in Front Royal, Virginia include many outdoor habitats and complex, specialized facilities designed to care for wildlife . Every animal in the collection requires a specific habitat, designed to meet its physical and psychological needs. This includes everything from shade structures to protect the eyesight of seals and sea lions to climbing structure s sturdy enough to withstand the activities of a gorilla troop . In addition , the NZCBI maintains miles of animal containment that must be constantly secured and maintained to protect both animals and the public . Maintaining animal habitats and providing specialized items for animals' health and well -being are not just recommended best pract ices but required by oversight and regulatory entities such as the AZA and the USDA. Most critically, animal care staff, including keepers, curators, veterinarians, and scientists, must possess specialized knowledge and training, and staff numbers must be maintained at appropriate levels to ensure the life, safety , and health of both animals and people . Accordingly, $650,000 of our request will go to support this critical functional area so the NZCBI can ensure the care and maintenance of a robust live collection while also protecting the safety of its staff and the public . The needs and standards for animal and veterinary care increase as our understanding of the unique challenges of caring for critical ly endangered species increases and regulations concerning animal health and welfare change. In the post - COVID -19 environment and the wake of global inflation and supply chain disruptions, the impact to the medical care system in the past two years has led to a significant increase in the costs of medicine, lab testing, and medical care for the NZCBI's animals. This has challenged the NZCBI as one of the leading organizations in the United States addressing health care and pandemic diseases for the living c ollection. Although the NZCBI has thus far maintained minimal care standards, mission - essential resources have been redirected to maintain these standards. Inflationary pressures during the past year have further eroded the NZCBI's ability to appropriately feed and care for the animals in our care. Without the additional resources for the living collection, the quality of animal care , research , and conservation will be diminished, or the size of the liv ing collection may have to be reduce d \u2014 meaning that species at risk today will not benefit in the way that other critically endangered species have. Without additional funding , prior successes will be diminished and future efforts and visitors ' experience s will be at risk. That is why $800,000 of this request address es the higher costs of food, medicine, and hay due to inflation and increasing costs . 75 The last component of our request for increased funding concerns the NZCBI 's continuing effort to modernize its historic 1920s infrastructure. The reopening of the Bird House, after a six-year closure, marks a crucial point in the conservation of native migratory songbirds in the United States. The ability of visitors to walk through the free-flight aviaries, a first for the NZCBI, will engender wonder and educate our visitors on the importance of these birds. Consequently, $50,000 of this request is to appropriately support the newly imagined Bird House space and maintain the health and welfare of the birds in this collection. NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 General trust funds , including onsite earned revenue (e.g., parking, food, and retail , etc.) support salaries and benefits of the NZCBI director and general operational requirements not fully covered by federal funds (e.g., education, professional training, animal acquisitions, finance and administration, information technology , communications, exhibits, and animal care). Donor/sponsor -designated funds support costs related to specific programs and projects for critically endangered species (e.g., antelope , amphibians, cheetah s, giant pandas, Asian elephant s, and tigers , etc.). Private donations help the NZCBI implement multiple small -to medium -sized projects and support exhibit interpretive design and implementation. Government grants and contracts support a wide array of scientific studies on ecology and the biology and habitats of wildlife species. 76 SMITHSONIAN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH CENTER APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED 27 2,468 FY 2023 ENACTED 34 4,934 6 700 15 2,000 30 4,000 27 2,700 FY 2024 REQUEST 36 5,430 7 800 15 2,300 30 4,000 27 2,500 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage research and discovery 22 3,218 23 3,530 1 312 Public Programs Provide relevant reference services and disseminate information to the public 4 663 4 686 0 23 Management Operations Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure 8 1,053 9 1,214 1 161 Total 34 4,934 36 5,430 2 496Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT The Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) is a national leader in research and public programs on ecosystems in the coastal zone , where most of the world's population lives and our economy is based . SERC's innovative research and unique setting advance basic environmental science to inform wise policy management decisions for many natural resources on the coasts . SERC's complementary array of hands -on and virtual programs also provide the public with the kno wledge to solve the environmental challenges of the 21st century. Research and discovery are the core activities at SERC . Scientists use the Center's 2,650 -acre site on the shore s of the Chesapeake Bay , the nation's largest estuary, as a model system for long-term research and one-of-a-kind experiments. SERC researchers incorporate other sites, including Smithsonian field stations , to investigat e connections among aquatic, terrestrial, and atmospheric components of 77 complex ecosystems through comparative studies on regional, continental, and global scales. In addition, SERC is a partner in key Smithsonian research initiatives, including Life on a Sustainable Planet , ForestGEO , and MarineGEO (Global Earth Observatories ). SERC also leads collaborations with other federal research networks, such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) funded by the N ational Science Foundation (NSF) , and the National Ballast Information Clearinghouse (NBIC) funded by the U.S. Coast Guard. SERC is expanding programs for public engagement . Public outreach programs connect thousands of people to a wide range of activities, including virtual evening lectures, Science Saturdays for families, nature hikes , and tours of the Center's facilities. In 2021, SERC finished restoring the historic 1735 Woodlawn House as a welcome center and public exhibit on the archaeology and history of land use at the Rhode River site. Science , technology, engineering, and mathematics (S TEM ) programs in environmental science provide thousands of school children with hands -on projects and virtual field trips and teachers with training that builds their confidence to lead students in STEM activit ies. In addition, SERC's highly successful citizen -science program engages more than 500 volunteers in research across a wide spectrum of projects. The Center's vigorous professional training program for interns, graduate and postdoctoral Fellows , and visi ting scientists produc es the next generation of scientists and natural resource managers . SERC's strategic plan envisions the Smithsonian Institute for the Environment that will convene interdisciplinary teams to solve difficult environmental problems and advance visionary research. In addition, SERC continue s to update and implement its facilities master plan . In FY 202 3, the Center add ed short -term housing to its Green Village as cottages for visiting scholars and consolidated its facilities maintenance structures for improved safety and efficiency. SERC is a Smithsonian leader in s ustainability through energy conservation and shift s to renewable solar energy , and in FY 2023 the six newly completed visitor's cottages became the Smit hsonian's first \"net -positive energy\" buildings to take the next step to ward the Center's goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions for all of SERC by 202 5. Improved water reuse and recycling systems also eliminate waste at the site . MEANS AND STRATEGY In addition to federal appropriations, SERC achieves its research mission through competitive success at applying for extramural grants and contracts. With these public and private resources, SERC stewards its 2,650 -acre Chesapeake site as a mode l for long -term research and experiments on land -sea interactions. The site's topography of streams, shorelines, forests, and agricultural fields now provide ecological data sets going back nearly 60 years, and host large -scale experiments, instrument arra ys, and remote sensing . SERC leverages its local infrastructure and global research platform to measure the effects of land use, pollution, fisheries, invasive species, habitat restoration, and climate change on biodiversity and complex ecosystem interacti ons. To observe and interpret changes in near -shore marine ecosystems and 78 terrestrial environments, SERC serves as the headquarters for the MarineGEO program, leads long -term studies of ForestGEO's temperate forest plots, and is a base for the NSF-funded NEON forest tower and ground -based sampling array . SERC also supports the efforts of other federal agencies and collaborators ( such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Geological Survey, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U .S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Coast Guard, the Department of Energy, and many universities and state agencies). SERC's research, education, and outreach activities support the Smithsonian's Strategic Plan by informing local environmental resource ma nagement and conservation and engaging the public in hands -on science. SERC uses its Chesapeake base to test and inform new national and international approaches to habitat restoration of forests, streams, wetlands , and shorelines . The Center uses the Smithsonian 's Earth Optimism program as a power ful communication s tool to engage the public and policy makers in applying its research results . SERC plans a primary facility to convene diverse teams of business leaders, policy makers, educators , and s cientists to find innovative solutions to the difficult environmental problems facing our nation . In addition to providing a public lecture series, workshops, and many volunteer opportunities , the Center also offers expert consultation for the public, including teachers and public officials . As part of its interactive core mission, SERC is open to the public six days a week for visitors to explore the Center's many trails through forests , fields, and more than 1 5 miles of shoreline along the Chesapeake Bay. Furthermore, SERC 's comprehensive facilities master plan will continue to support sustainable growth to improve public access and engagement and highlight conservation lessons by setting an example of decreasing energy and water consumption to reduce operating costs across the campus. Finally, SERC management ensure s proper accounting for its research activities, including indirect cost recovery in its sponsored research program. The Center also maintains excellent record s of safety for all employees and visitors , as well as for managing its properties and protecting sensitive information and data. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes an increase of $496,000 that provides $236,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff funded under this line item , and a programmati c increase of 2 FTEs and $260,000 for a human resources specialist and coordinator for its Scientific V isitor Program . Operations Support (+$110,000, +1 FTE) This budget request includes an increase of $110,000 and 1 FTE to hire a human resources specialist . SERC has no staff dedicated to support the many personnel transactions and record keeping for position classification, hiring, training, promotions, and de partures for a very active programs in research and public engagement. The 79 central Smithsonian Office of Human Resources does not have capacity to support these activities , so funding this request would enable SERC to ensure these transactions comply with Office of Personnel Management and SI guidelines and policy. Scientific Research (+$150,000, +1 FTE) The request includes funding to support new and innovative research collaborations on major coastal environmental issues related to climate , biod iversity, and resilience by enhancing and expanding its Scientific Visitor Program. As SERC's profile has grown for its expertise on major coastal environmental issues, demand for on -site workshops for visiting scholars has increased to synthesize data and inform restoration efforts. Present staffing provides inadequate support for existing activities, let alone to meet new and increasing demands for collaborative problem solving. This additional funding will support a coordinator for the program, enabling the participation of more visiting scholars. NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 Extramural Government grants, contracts, and interagency agreements amounting to approximately $ 8 millio n annually support most (70 percent ) of SERC's scientific research program , including the NBIC as established by Congress under the National Invasive Species Act of 1996. In addition, indirect cost recovery derived from these extramural research and education awards provide s core administrative support . Other resources include donor/sponsor -designated funds which provide essential operating support for specific programs and projects in research, public education, and professional training. 80 SMITHSONIAN TROPICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 202 1,529 55 8,138 15 1,740 Federal Resource Summary by Performance and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage and discovery 113 10,178 114 11,465 1 1,287 Digital Transformation Provide improved digitization and audience engagement 3 208 3 213 0 5 Education Provide education support to engage and inspire diverse audiences 2 368 2 380 0 12 Public Programs Provide relevant reference services and disseminate information to the public 6 497 6 537 0 40 Security Provide world-class protection for Smithsonian facilities, collections, staff, visitors and volunteers 18 736 18 795 0 59 Management Operations Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure 41 3,674 41 3,910 0 236 Information Technology Improve the Institution's information technology systems and infrastructure 8 515 8 550 0 35 Total 191 16,176 192 17,850 1 1,674Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change 81 BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT In 1910, Smithsonian Secretary Charles Walcott received a request from President William Howard Taft to send a scientific expedition to Panama to study the environmental impact of the Panama Canal. The President of Panama, Pablo Arosemena, invited the Smithsonian to extend its st udy to the entire i sthmus (1910 -1912), establishing a relationship that more than 110 years later continues to be a remarkable scien tific investment for both countries and the world at large . The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) is now the principal U.S. organization dedicated to advancing fundamental scientific discovery and understanding of biological and cultural diversity in the tropics , and its contribution to human welfare. As such, STRI plays an important role for the U.S. Government and the Smithsonian by maintaining world -class research facilities in Panama, where each year approximately 1,400 resident and visiting international scientists and university students come to conduct re search . STRI serves as the official custodian for the Barro Colorado Nature Monument (BCNM) , under the terms of the Convention on Nature Protection and Wildlife Preservation in the Western Hemisphere , as ratified by the U.S. Senate in April of 1941 and codified in the Panama Canal Treaties . The BCNM is the only mainland tropical reserve under U.S. stewardship since it first served as the original base of operations for the 1910 expedition . STRI also owns and administers Coibita Island , which was beq ueathed to the Institution to preserve and use for research, and is part of Panama's Coiba National Park, a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO ) World Heritage Site. The rise of the Isthmus of Panama , about three million years ago, changed the world. It connected North and South America and separated the Atlantic from the Pacific Ocean , setting into motion a global change that dramatically impacted marine and terrestr ial life. STRI is located at the ideal spot to study this event . Its 13 research facilities and field stations , situated throughout Panama's diverse ecosystems , serve as an unparalleled field research platform to investigate the groundbreaking events that shaped the modern world and its tropical diversity . Scientific Productivity A Visiting Committee of outside experts regularly evaluates t he relevance, quality, and performance of STRI scientists . In their last review, the Visiting Committee used National Research Council criteria to measure the productivity and impact of STRI science compared to 142 of the best university research dep artments in the United States. STRI scientists ranked first in all measures of scientific relevance ( such as publication citations), quality (in terms of scientific honors), and productivity ( including publication numbers). In addition, the number of young scientists who choose STRI as the base for their graduate and postgraduate research training provides an other annual measure of the relevanc e and quality of STRI science to the future of tropical biology and policy. STRI's staff share their research platform with scientists from the United States and international organizations . This collaborative effort has produced more than 15,207 scient ific publications to date , and currently results in an average of one new scientific publication every day. 82 FY 2021 and part of FY 2022 were challenging yea rs for the Institute because the measures needed to contain the COVID -19 pandemic required the continued closure of STRI facilities for much of that time . Despite the closures, STRI's scientific achievements include the following: 1) employ ing 40 staff scientists and hosting some 1,400 scientific visitors every year, from undergrad uates and interns to postdoctoral investigators and tenured research associates ; 2) helping to manage 350 running research projects annually; and 3) publish ing more t han 400 peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals every year. The research is not only shared widely with the global scientific community, but also reaches policy makers in Panama and beyond, receives worldwide media coverage, and is the foundation for an outreach and training program that reaches hundreds of teachers and tens of thousands of school children every year. Scientific Direction s The long -term research conducted by STRI scientists and collaborators is a n essential contribution to the Smithsonian Institution's Strategic Plan. The Barro Colorado Island Research Station in Panama will celebrate its upcoming 100th birthday with an exhibition at Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural Histor y in Washington DC. This e xhibition will be an expanded version of the one shown in Panama City at the Museo del Canal Interoceanic o. This year , STRI will participate in the I nstitution -wide Ocean Strategy , with a clear focus on marine science for sustainability. This strategy will focus new and existing resources on four integrated research pillars critical for resolving the future of ocean environments in the face of global change: drivers of reef resilien ce; blue carbon and ecosystem co -benefits ; marine biodiversity and sustainable fisheries ; and urbanized coasts. MEANS AND STRATEGY STRI is the only major research center to locate modern scientific instrumentation and facilities at the edges of tropical forests and coral reefs. Institute staff lead internationally recognized research programs and assist scientific visitors with obtaining visas, collecting permits, transportation, housing, computing, and library needs . STRI staff are also mentors for students from universities across the U nited States and around the world. Pan amanian staff and the support of the Government of Panama , including rent- free use of multip le propert ies, have fostered Smithsonian research in Panama for more than a century and STRI has been an exceptional ambassador of goodwill for the United States in Panama and throughout Latin America. As part of its core mission, STRI will continue to enhance the Smithsonian's scientific platform for long -term research on biodiversity, ecosystems, and the impacts of environmental change . This will be done through novel research, educating the next gener ation of scientists , and disseminating scientific findings to its global audiences. Policy makers and scientists need long -term data on fluctuations in the primary productivity of forests and reefs around the globe, as well as information on changes in the abundance and distribution of biological diversit y. STRI provides that information like 83 no other part of the U .S. mission in Panama . In addition, the Institute shares knowledge, experience , and expertise with the next generation of tropical scientists. STRI typically hosts more than 800 pre -and postdoctoral students each year , half of whom come from the United States . For many, their experience at STRI is their first real opportunity to be scientists. Furthermore, the Institute supports education by working with science teachers to inspire wonder and critical thinking skills in the classroom. In Panama and through digital partnerships with U.S. school districts, STRI explain s field and laboratory science and make s environmental research readily accessible to teachers and students. ENABLING STRI's MISSION THROUGH ORGANIZATIONAL EXCELLENCE The Institute continues to advance the vision detailed in the decadal plan for upgrading its facilities, some of which date back to the pre -World War II era of Panama Canal defense. STRI is also developing its Coibita facilities as required by its benefactors . In addition, the Institute offers important facility resources for federal agencies and universities. For terrestrial research, STRI serves as the headquarters for ForestGEO . For coastal areas, the U.S. Geological Survey partnered with STRI to establish seismic monitoring equipment on BCNM as part of its Caribbean Tsunami Warning System. Moreover , the Continuously Operating Caribbean GPS Observational Network (COCONet) project, funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) , has partnered with STRI to develop large -scale geodetic an d atmospheric monitoring infrastructure in the Caribbean. STRI 's two marine facilities in the Atlantic (Bocas del Toro and Galeta) and two in the Pacific (Naos and Coibita Island) permit scientists to move between experiments in the eastern Pacific Ocean a nd the Caribbean Sea in a few hours . This recurring two -ocean theme in marine science at STRI has resulted in landmark studies of the evolution and ecology of tropical marine species and communities, as well as research funded by the NSF and the National Institute s of Health for the ecologically guided discovery of new pharmaceutical compounds. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes an increase of $1,674,000 that provide s $724,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff funded under this line item, as well as a programmatic increase of $950,000 and 1 FTE to support the Institute's research mission . Scientific Research (+$950,000, + 1 FTE) The Institute requests a funding increase (+$950,000 and +1 FTE) to strengthen its support for marine science research . For decades, STRI has maintained a robust marine monitoring program, providing researchers with high-quality meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic data needed to support their work . The program includes nine automated weather stations, two weirs, a network of remote ocean temperature sensors deployed along the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Pan ama, and multiparameter ocean water -quality monitoring in the Bay of Panama and Bocas del Toro. This program is supported by one full -time staff position, focused principally on terrestrial monitoring. In the last decade, STRI has made steady progress in developing its marine social, ecological, biological, and physical monitoring program, which now includes a mix of temperature, 84 salinity, acidity , turbidity , chlorophyll , light , and other measurements . However, this program has no staff support. With the la unch of the SI -wide Ocean Strategy, STRI has an urgent need for standardized physical data on the major marine regions of Panama (Bocas del Toro and Galeta on the Caribbean and Coiba and Las Perlas on the Pacific). This monitoring program should be predominantly near the shore (including relevant islands) and should, at minimum , collect key variables critical for measuring climate change, including acidity , partial pressure of carbon dioxide , alkali nity, water t emperature , dissolved oxygen salinity . In addition, STRI and Institution -wide marine research also requires standardized sea-level monitoring and bathymetric mapping in all four regions named above . This work requires permanent sites in e ach region , with environmental variables monitored on the sea floor and the surface, as well as sensor arrays in each region to detect regional variation of basic variables (temperature, salinity , and dissolved oxygen). The request will support a marine mo nitoring coordinator for all STRI research related to this program. In FY 2023, the Smithsonian launched an Institution -wide Ocean Strategy with a clear focus on science for sustainability. As part of this initiative, STRI is committed to establish ing and resourcing interlocking centers dedicated to ocean and sustainability science. This includes a request to replace STRI's 22-year-old research boat, a federally funded vessel in the fleet, to fill a significant gap in our capacity to facili tate and enhance research opportunities in the farthest research areas in Gulf of Panama. The Institute proposed replacing its aging, 23 -foot vessel with a 30-foot-long boat for six passengers with diving capabilities, ample deck workspace , and a davit for bottom sampling , with 300 pounds of lift. Finally, without the funds requested , STRI will be unable to adequately support the Institution -wide Life on a Sustainable Planet Ocean Strategy and establish the interlocking centers to build partnerships and conduct integrated research in service of sustainability. NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 General trust funds support salaries and programmatic expenses for a small percentage of STRI employees involved in research, public outreach, and fund raising. Donor /sponsor -designated funds support discretionary research needs and specific programs , project s, and positions , including donor- designated support for an endowed chair for the director , an endowed staff position in tropical paleoecology , an endowed chair for the director of ForestGEO , and private funds to support the Institute's Agua Salud program that studies carbon sequestration and tropical reforestation, as well as a 10-year staff position in terrestrial microbiology . Funding from the Rohr Foundation , board members , and an emeritus scientist has enabled the Institute to fund six new postdoctoral Fellows . After the COVID -19 pandemic , STRI experienced a significant loss of earned revenue due to temporary closure of all facilities and the cancellation of most academic courses due to the shutdowns caused by the pandemic . This gap in earned revenue has required STRI to make painful budget cuts and realign its expenses to maintain financial stability during the ongoing closures. Despite this adversity , STRI received a $3 million NSF award with Global Sustainability Scholars . These funds will allow STRI to host 36 post -baccalaureate scholar s from under -represented groups in the United States to work for one-year Fellowship periods with STRI scientists in the next four years. 85 ARTHUR M.

Almost 65 years later, on September 28,1987, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery opened to complement the Freer , adding another 1,000 works of Asian art and more than 40,000 square feet of public space to the existing building . Today , 100 years since opening its doors, the Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art is committed to preserving, exhibiting, researching, and interpreting art in ways that deepen our collective understanding of Asia and the wo rld. Home to more than 4 6,000 objects, the Museum stewards one of North America 's largest and most comprehensive collections of Asian art, with works dating from antiquity to the present , from China, Japan, Korea, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Islamic world. Its rich holdings bring the arts of Asia into dialogue with an important collection of 19th-and early 20th -century American works, providing a bridge for creative collaboration s and cultural exchange s between the United States, Asia, and the Middle East. Beginning with a 1906 gift that paved the way for the Freer Gallery 's opening in 1923, the National Museum of Asian Art is a leading resource for visitors, students, and scholar s in the United States and internationally. Based on broad consultation, and fully aligned with the Smithsonian 's overall Strategic Plan , the Museum's new strategic plan , adopted in June of 2019 , charts a path forward that is as faithful to the past as it is ambitiously future -oriented. The vision, values, and goals that it sets out promise a more creative, engaged, and efficient Museum; one that celebrates Asian art and addresses basic questions about culture. It aims to do full justice to the extraordinary art it houses and the public trust it holds. MEANS AND STRATEGY The Museum will advance both Institution -wide and internal goals by continuing to execute its 2020 -2025 strategic plan to guide operations, planning , and decision making. The plan's four goals are both practical and ambitious. They are as follows: Goal 1: To expand, preserve , and celebrate our collections ; Goal 2: To identify, attract , and serve new audiences through both our physical and digital spaces ; Goal 3: To foster an object -inspired understanding of the arts communities, cultures, and societies of Asia; and Goal 4: To build a museum culture that is creative, collaborative, trans parent , and resourceful. In FY 2024 , the Museum will: continue celebrating the centennial of the Freer Gallery through a series of exhibitions, public programs, and events ; 87 add distinction to its newly established National Museum of Asian Art collection through the ongoing acquisition of extraordinary objects and donated collections; provide expertise in cultural heritage to global partners through training programs, joint ex hibitions, and research projects ; ensure the integrity of our collection by enhancing the Museum's excellence in conservation and scientific research ; implement a digitization plan that extends our reach and impact to national and international audiences ; raise our local, national, and global profile with a coordinated campaign of communications, partnerships, and program s to attract audiences interested in understanding and celebrating Asian art and culture ; better address visitor needs ; fund collaborations with selected Smithsonian museums, universities, and other nonprofit partners to broaden our expertise and impact in fostering an understanding of Asian arts, cultures, and societies ; strengthen relationships with Asian and Asian American communities, including organizations that represent them, by enhancing our outreach and programming through formal partnerships and informal collaborations; increase its paid internship program for both undergraduate and postgraduate student s, first established in FY 2022; and advance a robust fundraising strategy to support the Museum's highest priority programs . The Museum will monitor progress on these focused plans and other daily operations through its cross -departmental implementation team . This team provides regular oversight of action plans and tracks progress on key performance indicators. These metrics allow the Museum to take advantage of emerging opportunities and adjust to revenue fluctuations while also providing the focus need ed to ensure that the four main goals of the strategic plan are achieved . In addition, the Museum has a longstanding commitment to education, scholarship, and research , which will continue to advance by sharing knowledge with student audiences through deep digital engagement and online programming that bring our collections and research to the public . In FY 2023, the Museum began a search for a new leadership position to add depth and strength to its educational offering s. This new associate director for community engagement , learning , and interpretation will also lead the Museum 's Diversity, Equity, Acces s, and Inclusion ( DEAI ) initiatives. In FY 2024 , the Museum will pay special attention to programming, visitor services, communication s, research, monitoring the integrity of our infrastructure , and advancement. The Museum will also increase its commitment to visitor accessibility by: continuing its centennial year celebration through the s pring of 2024 ; adding two additional heritage festivals ; 88 building on audience research , including the results of the study support ed by a grant from the Smithsonian's Asian American Pacific Islander Center , to help the Museum's leadership better understand how Asian American communities view our collections, galleries, and program s; leverag ing the emerging partnerships created through its grant activity to deepen the public's understanding of Asian religions through programming, digital initiatives, and exhibitions ; capitalizing on a digital -first approach that put s the Museum at the forefront of the Smithsonian's open -access effort by executing the digital strategic plan developed with an Institution -wide team of digital experts ; planning for a new Center for Asian Art Conservation, Research , and Education that will build upon the Museum's unrivalled expertise in A sian art conservation, and both broaden and deepen the Museum's impact as a leading educational resource for visitors , both in person and online; transforming the Museum's current laboratory into an active site of participation in and collaboration on con servation and scientific research. By expanding its digital reach, the Museum will engage current and new audiences more deeply in conservation work, sharing knowledge , and stimulating innovative ideas ; and continuing to implement digital solutions which add interactive features and functionality to core activities and better serve the needs of internal and external users . The FY 2024 exhibition schedule and complementary public programs will offer opportunities for au dience engagement with both historical and contemporary topics and provide visitors with access to some of the finest works of Asian art. As the Museum continue s to build a culture that is creative, collaborative, transparent, and resourceful, staff will assess and enhance their own development, the efficacy of their organizational structure, and oversight of internal controls by: maintaining fiscal discipline in support of the Museum's strategic plan and taking advantage of opportunities for investments in infrastructure and new partnerships ; recruiting new talent in the areas of curation , research, visitor services, digital and multimedia, and administration . In FY 2024 , the Museum's staff will collaborate with colleagues to provide the mentorship and resources need ed to advance our mission. This infusion of new thinking, talent , and enthusiasm will also allow the facility 's leadership to assess operations and ensure that the Museum is nimble, collaborative, and well -positioned to meet the challenges of the next century ; and dedicat ing funds for leadership and supervisory training to equip managers and supervisors with the information, skills, and tools needed to make effective decisions and better serve the visiting public . 89 EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes an increase of $291,000 that provides for necessary pay and other related salary costs . NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 General trust and donor/sponsor -designated funds are generated from memberships ; revenue sharing from Museum shop sales and the Smithsonian Channel; participation fees from traveling exhibition venues; special events; unrestricted and restricte d gifts and grants ; and endowment income. The National Museum of Asian Art depend s to a substantial extent on income sources to support the quality of exhibitions, programs, and publications expected by visitors and scholars, both online and on site. 90 ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN CENTER APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 2,520 1 222 0 0 0 0 FY 20 23 ENACTED 7 2,560 0 88 0 0 0 0 FY 202 4 REQUEST 7 2,615 0 37 0 0 0 0 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage in vital arts and humanities research 0 324 0 345 0 21 Digital Transformation Provide improved digitization and audience engagement 0 50 0 50 0 0 Education Provide education support to engage and inspire diverse audiences 0 90 0 0 0 -90 Public Programs Provide relevant reference services and disseminate information to the public 5 718 5 972 0 254 Exhibitions Offer compelling, first-class exhibitions 0 649 0 535 0 -114 Collections Improve the stewardship of the national collections 0 502 0 410 0 -92 Management Operations Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure 2 227 2 303 0 76 Total 7 2,560 72,615 0 55Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT The Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center (APAC) was established in 1997 as a mission -critical initiative to further the inclusion of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (AANHPI) across the Smithsonian 's collections, research, exhi bitions, and programs. Asian Americans are the fastest -growing racial and ethnic group in the United States. More than 24 million American citizen s trace their roots to 20 + countries in East and Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. In less than 50 y ears, nearly one of every 10 people 91 in America will have a heritage from the continent of Asia and the Pacific Islands. Given the importance and size of these demographics, it is essential that AANHPI stories be told to ensure our understanding of America and America's standing in the world is more accurate, compelling, and powerful. Having celebrated its 25th year in 2022, the APAC is extending its mission of amplifying AANHPI voices at the Smithsonian by creating new spaces for storytelling on the Natio nal Mall in Washington, DC. This period of significant and fast-paced transformation will shift APAC's mostly virtual presence into more physical and enduring spaces, culminating in a dedicated gallery on the Mall \u2014 slated to open in 2030 \u2014 where community members and visitors can learn how the AANPHI people have contributed to the American experience and America's position in the world. In the FY 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congress decided to appropriate the Center's federal resources of $860,000 and 7 FTEs in its own line item . This new line item also include d $1,700,000 in funds for the Asian Pacific American Initiatives Pool ( APAIP ), which brought APAC's total FY 2023 allocation to $2,560,000. MEANS AND STRATEGY As the APAC works to create the Smithsonian's first museum space dedicated to exploring the complexities of AANHPI history, culture, and lived experiences, the Center's efforts advance the Institution 's strategic goals. The path to establishing this dedicated spa ce begins with two one -year residencies at sister Smithsonian units . The APAC work s across units to display co -collected objects and integrate AANHPI stories into narratives told in existing spaces . These unexpected story arcs catalyze new conversations th at address the complex challenge of telling a full and inclusive story of the American experience. Yearlong residencies will help the Center develop a dedicated gallery by providing the time and space to test a range of interpretive strategies, content, and design approaches, as well as identify visitor needs to help the APAC better understand and impact 21st -century audiences. More importantly, this is a phased approach to engaging the vast landscape of cultural stewards and presenters with whom the Cent er must develop reciprocal and respective relationships to collectively drive this visionary and interdisciplinary work. The Smithsonian's dedicated gallery will be the Institution's first effort to tell a pan-AANHPI story with significant collection s development, research, and interpretation that fully embod ies the principles of the Smithsonian Strategic Plan to create greater reach, greater relevance , and profound impact in serving the public . 92 ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN INITIATIVES POOL The APAIP will document the full spectrum of the American Experience by allocating funds to support research, exhibitions, educational programs, collections, digital and media projects, as well as partnerships with local and regional cultural organizations. Projects are selected on a competitive basis from proposals that demonstrate innovation and advancement of scholarship , cost-effective deployment of the pool funds, coordination with other Smithsonian resources, and successful external fund raising from the private sector. Since its inception in FY 2016, the APAIP has funded more than 80 programs and projects across the Smithsonian and increased the Asian Pacific American presence in the Institution's presentation of and research into the American Experience. In FY 2018, the APAIP supported its first curator dedicated to preserving and exhibiting Asian Pacific American history at the National Museum of American History ( NMAH ). With the additional funding provided in FY s 2020 and 2022, the pool was able to suppo rt more projects and employ two curatorial assistants \u2014 one at NMAH and the other at the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage (CFCH) . In FY 2023 , the APAIP will take on the additional responsibility of support ing a curator at the National Museum of Am erican Indian (NMAI) to focus on Native Hawa iian History and Culture , a collections specialist at the Archives of American Art focused on Asian Pacific American art, and a curatorial assistant at the Smithsonian American Art Museum to support the research, documentation, display, and acquisition of works by Asian Pacific American artist s. All positions supported by the pool are not to exceed four-year term positions. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes an increase of $55,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff funded under this line item. NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 General trust funds support salary and benefit costs for the Center director a nd other program -related costs. Donor/sponsor -designated funds support salaries and benefits for development staff; costs associated with reaching the APAC's fundraising goals; training of future conservators; conservation of objects for exhibits and commu nity loans; publications and special events for exhibition openings; and costs related to specific programs and projects . 93 CENTER FOR FOLKLIFE AND CULTURAL HERITAGE APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 1,272 2 1,233 FY 20 23 ENACTED 20 3,938 12 1,681 7 2,200 4 1,400 FY 20 24 REQUEST 21 4,532 12 1,512 7 2,200 0 600 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage in impactful scientific research and discovery Engage in vital arts and humanities research 1 190 1 196 0 6 Digital Transformation Provide improved digitization and audience engagement 1 210 2 389 1 179 Education Provide education support to engage and inspire diverse audiences 1 215 1 221 0 6 Exhibitions Offer compelling, first-class exhibitions 11 1,891 11 2,263 0 372 Collections Improve the stewardship of the national collections 3 450 3 465 0 15 Facilities Operations and Maintenance Improve facilities operations and provide a safe and healthy environment 0 395 0 395 0 0 Deliver an aggressive and professional maintenance program Security Provide world-class protection for Smithsonian facilities, collections, staff, visitors and volunteers 0 150 0 150 0 0 Management Operations Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure 3 437 3 453 0 16 Total 20 3,938 21 4,532 1 594Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT The Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage (CFCH) is a Smithsonian research and education unit with the mission to increase understanding of the diverse , community -based cultural traditions found in the United States and around the world, aid their pres ervation, and strengthen the public's appreciation for our 94 shared humanity. For more than five decades, the CFCH has accomplished this mission through scholarly research, public presentation s \u2014 most dramatically through the Smithsonian Folklife Festival \u2014 and the widely distributed Smithsonian Folkways Recordings, as well as publications which rely on documentation in the Ralph Rinzler Folklife Archives and Collections , and various other cultural heritage and sustainability projects. The Center has also dev eloped a robust website and digital outreach presence that reaches an audience of hundreds of millions. The CFCH collaborates with Smithsonian museums, cultural and educational centers, and other federal partners \u2014 especially the Library of Congress' American Folklife Center and the National Endowment for the Arts' Folk and Traditional Arts program \u2014 in addition to hundreds of organizations in the United States and around the globe. The CFCH is recognized as a national and world leader in the cultural heritage field. The award -winning Smithsonian Folklife Festival is a model for presenting living , community -based cultural heritage in the United S tates and other nations . The Center has repeatedly produce d large , public educational events similar to the Festival \"back home\" in many U.S. states, as well as for presidential inaugurals , the opening of national museums and monuments such as the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) , the National Museum of the American Indian , the World War II Memorial , the Smithsonian's 150 th anniversary, the bicentennial of the United States and the Olympics. The quality of CFCH products is widely recognized. Smithsonian Folkways Recordings has won 10 Grammy Award s for its productions, 11 lifetime Grammys for its key artists, three Grammy Hall of Fame awards , 30 additional Grammy nominations, one Latin Grammy, two Latin Grammy nominations , and 30 Independent Music Awards. Recognition of the CFCH's excellence include s Academy and Emmy Awards for documentary film s, and awards from various educational organizations. Center staff have authored important books , been elected to national academies and designated as prestigious Fellows , led professional associations, and received top national and international honors in their fields . CFCH personnel lecture at universities and museums and annually mentor some 120 interns and Fellows from the United States and other nations. In addition, the Center consults with the U.S. Department of State on international cultural heritage policies and practices and has partnered with the U.S. Agency on International Development ( USAID ) on many projects to encourage cultural enterprise and development as a vehicle for cultural preservat ion and vitality . MEANS AND STRATEGY The CFCH accomplishes its mission through high -quality scholarship, educational productions, and project implementation involv ing Smithsonian and numerous external partners , including U.S. agencies, state cultural agencies, and international cultural organizations . Toward this end, f ederal appropriations provide base -level support for research and education, archival and collections care, and Festival production , while also leveraging considerable support from U.S. federal and 95 state agencies, foreign nations, foundations , and philanthropic sources. Federal collections support is vital for research and educational purposes, and for Smithsonian Folkways Recordings, which generat es $3 million annually in earned revenue to support 19 staff salaries and operations from the proceeds of distributing and licensing music in the collections . Federal funds represent an investment that annually leverages about three times its value in nonappropriated funds and helps the CFCH reach an audience of more than 300 million a year, thereby also increas ing public understanding of grassroots cultural traditions in the United States and abroad. The Center 's original signature production , the Smithsonian Folklife Festival , returned to the National Mall for two weeks around the July 4 th holiday in 2022 after a hiatus necessitated by the COVID -19 pandemic and public health and safety concerns. One Festival program featured Earth Optimism , with more than 200 cultural exemplars and scientists demonstrating how cultural traditions are addressing environmental conservation and sustainable practices while enhan cing innovation, civic engagement, and economic development. The second program feature d the folklife and cultural heritage of the United Arab Emirates. More than 100 cultural practitioners performed traditional songs and dances, demonstrated traditional v isual, culinary , and occupational arts, and illustrated how that heritage is being adapted and applied to contemporary circumstances. A series of concerts featured Puerto Rican bomba and plena music as well as Tex-Mex and Appalachian music . Long -term colla borator Yo-Yo Ma hosted a concert focusing on Afghani and Asian musical traditions, now carried to the United States by immigrants and refugees. In relaunching the Festival, t he Center adapt ed lessons learned during the pandemic years , with a vigorous online presence offering musical performances, crafts and cooking demonstrations , and panel discussions which reached well beyond the National Mall . In 2023, the Festival will present several programs , including one on the culture of the Ozarks \u2014 focusing on Missouri and Arkansas \u2014 and another on the cultural traditions \u2014 foodways, music, craftsmanship , and celebration \u2014 growing out of the diversity of religious communities in the United States . A special July 4 th concert is planned to feature musicians from Ukraine. Building on lessons learned during the pandemic years, the CFCH will continue to extend the Smithsonian's overall digital strategy and expand its reach beyond the two-week physical production on the National Mall. Meanwhile, Smithsonian Folkways Recordings \u2014 the Center's most broadly distributed signature product \u2014 has extended its impact with the continued success of several recently produced music boxed sets. The most elaborate was The Smithsonian Anthology of Hip -Hop and Rap , a major collaboration of Smithsonian Folkways with the NMAAHC and the hip -hop community. The production is on its way to becoming a signature publication, setting the standard for the field, much like prior Smithsonian anthologies of jazz and folk music did. Additional releases in 2022 included Hazel Dickens & Alice Gerrard , Pharis and Jason Romero's Tell 'Em You Were Gold , Rebolu's Mi Herencia/My Heritage , and My Lai by the Kronos Quartet Jake Blount's The New Faith , a musical exploration of Afro -futurism , was on many 96 top recordings lists for the year. In 2023 , Smithsonian Folkways ' planned recordings include major box set s of the Collections of Mack McCormick 1968 -1971 , Songs from Senegal and the Gambi a, Corazones Candiones , and Aga Kahn Master Musicians . Folkways will also continue to extend its reach to millions more listeners, distributing 65,000 tracks of audio recordings to teachers, students, scholars, and the public via download and streaming services . In addition, the label will keep expand ing its collaboration with private partners to deliver the entire Folkways collection to more than 560 libraries throughout the North American continent and beyond. A third major program matic activity , the Smithsonian Cultural Vitality Program , fulfills the Center's commitment to cultural preservation by encouraging communit ies and local cultural exemplars to combine traditional practices and heritage with entrepreneurial activities in ways that generate both civic and economic benefit s. For example, the CFCH works closely with U .S. Native American organizations to preserve indigenous languages, and with African American artisans to expand their visibility and access to resource s and markets and enhance their economic opportunities . The Center also collaborates with USAID and other supporters to develop cultural t ourism, local artisanry, and other creative industries in Armenia, Tunisia, Bosnia and Herzegovina , Kazak hstan, Mexico, Moldova, and Bhutan. By building on their research and community -responsive collaborations , curators and research staff will continue to publish books, articles, and digital features, and make professional presentations at gatherings of specialists. The y also will continue to serve in an advisory capacity for other Smithsonian units and external agencies and in leadership roles for academic and professional societies. For example, CFCH curators contributed to the traveling exhibition World on the Move: 250,000 Years of Human Migration , produced in collaboration with the American Anthropological Association , that will be mounted in li braries around the country with support from the American Library Association. Curators also organized the , Smithsonian exhibition Music HerStory : Women and Music of Social Change , which premiered at the National Museum of American History and will also tour the nation. The Ralph Rinzler Folklife Archives and Collections contain the written and audiovisual documentation of more than 50 years of Festival research and planning , the recordings of Folkways and 19 other record labels , and a rapidly expanding digital footprint . Its major recent accomplishments include the renovation of the Center's archives repository with expanded off -site storage and the re-housing of collections. Archives staff have enhanced the tracking of collections , increased digitization of audiovisual media , and process ed additional materials from the Arhoolie Records collection and others . The Center will make these vast collections accessible to source communities and the public while ensuring their continued availab ility as a \"working archive\" for CFCH staff to use for ongoing productions. 97 Finally, t he CFCH continues to play a strong role in realizing the Smithsonian 's Strategic Plan. It is a key collaborator with many museums and units such as the annual Mother Tongue Film Festival it organizes with the National Museum of Natural History and the National Museum of the American Indian. It produces various educational programs and World Wide Web features with the Asian Pacific American Center and the Nationa l Museum of the American Latino. It produced the Music HerStory exhibition with help from the Smithsonian American Women's History Initiative and Smithsonian Libraries and Archives, and the benchmark Smithsonian Anthology of Hip Hop and Rap in collaboration with the NMAAHC . In keeping with its decades of community -based consultation and collaboration, the Center enshrined its commitments to culturally respectful collections management in its Shared Stewardship of Collections Policy and contributed to the Secretary's call for an Institution -wide policy on Shared Stewardship and Ethical Returns. In addition, the CFCH p rovides programming for the Smithsonian Channel and regularly contributes stories to Smithsonian magazine. As the Smithsonian a nd the nation prepare for the 250th anniversary of U.S. independence, the Center will play a major organizing and coordinat ing role in those activities . EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 202 4 budget request includes an increase of $594,000 that provides $116,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff funded under this line item , and an increase of $ 311,000 to cover the fixed cost s of Folklife Festival security and other necessary cost s, as justified in the Fixed Costs section of this budget submission . The request also includes a programmatic increase of $167,000 and 1 FTE for an audiovisual archivist, which is described below.

As one of the most visited modern art museums in the United Sta tes, the HMSG seek s to share the transformative power of modern and contemporary art by creating meaningful personal experiences in which art, artists, 103 audiences, and ideas converge. Through groundbreaking exhibitions, events, research, and acquisitions, visitors encounter the most important artists of the 21st century. The Hirshhorn's holdings encompass one of the most important collections of post-World War II art in the world, wherein today's artists have a global platform to explore new ways to create, with performance, digital media, video, and technology. As the national Museum for modern and contemporary art, the HMSG is home to a collection of more than 12,000 artworks and objects which cover the broad sweep of visual culture in the last 150 years , including paintings, sculpture, works on paper, performance, video, and digital media. While the initial collection was a gift from the Museum's founder, Joseph Hirshhorn, collections acquisition efforts are ongoing. The acquisition program focuses on artworks at the forefront of contemporary art, and the Museum has increased its efforts to prioritize greater diversity in its collection. For instance, nearly one -fifth of recent acquisitions in the last six years were created by Black artists. The collections care and conservation of the HMSG 's extensive holdings receive a substantial portion of the Museum's resources and enable s staff to showcase artwork at the building , online, and through an active loan program with other institutions. During FY 2021, the Museum transitioned from in -person to online programs and used digital -native content as the primary means of connecting with audiences. The closure of physical spaces required by the COVID -19 pandemic provided an opportunity to highlight the time -based media and video works within the Hirshhorn's collection. Staff curated novel, digital -native exhibitions available to visitors through the Museum's website and social media channels, while also looking forward to the building 's reopening and preparing thoughtful and well -researched physical exhibitions. The HMSG offers a wide range of educational and public programs serv ing diverse audiences and encourag ing viewers to learn about various fields of contemporary culture. The Museum leverage s the lessons learned from ARTLAB+ , the award -winning digital media studio that connects teenagers from local, underserved communities with artist mentors, to better serve diverse audiences with youth and family programming. The Hirshhorn is also constantly improving its financial and administ rative management tools and procedures. The Museum strives to create a staff culture that is efficient, collaborative, committed, innovative, and diverse. MEANS AND STRATEGY Efforts to support Enhanced Interdisciplinary Research continue as the Museum develops public forums on the intersections of art, design, technology, and education, featuring international subject -matter experts and an interactive online component, extendi ng digital audience engagement far beyond the walls of the physical building . The Hirshhorn will expand its online and on -site programs dealing with the role of technology and new media in contemporary art, museum culture, and digital education. The HMSG 's proposed exhibition schedule for FY 202 4 builds upon the mission to expand access to the arts and increase public understanding of, and engagement with, 104 the international scope of modern and contemporary art in all its diversity. FY 202 4 will feature exh ibitions and major events highlighting the best of emerging, international contemporary art. This will include: John Akomfrah's acclaimed six -channel video work, Purple (on view through January of 2024 ). This film captures ecological features around the world \u2014 from the Arctic to the South Pacific \u2014 which are at risk of or are disappearing due to changing climates. Wrapped in the gentle arc of the Museum's curved walls, the installation will allow visito rs to experience remote landscapes within a panoramic exploration of vulnerable environments. Set against current conversations regarding gender, power, and recognition in our society, the exhibition celebrates the depth, breadth, radicality, and rigor of art made by women while calling attention to the ways that gender itself can be understood in relation to the making and presentation of art \u2014 both irrelevant and irrevocable. A Window Suddenly Opens : Contemporary Photography in China (on view through January of 2024 ) include s a sweeping selection of contemporary Chinese photography. The exhibit ion includes works by more than 20 photographers from between 1993 and 2004, a vibrant period that put Beijing on the map as a nexus of experimental art. Evocative of the rapidly changing society from which they emerged, these photograph s are ambitious in scale and impact , and they resonate with possibility in the face of an unscripted future that is still un folding today . Opening in November of 2023, the Hirshhorn will feature the first comprehensive survey of artwork by Simone Leigh ( who was born in 1967 in Chicago). Among the most respected artists of her generation, Leigh represented the United States at the 59th International Art Exhibition of La Bienn ale di Venezia in 2022. The exhibition will survey approximately 20 years of her highly disciplined production s in ceramic, bronze, video, and installation s, and will feature works from Simone Leigh: Sovereignty , the artist's Venice Biennale presentation, providing audiences with the chance to experience this landmark installation. Addres sing a wide swath of historical periods, geographies, and traditions, her art references vernacular and hand -made processes from across the African diaspora, as well as forms traditionally associated with African art and architecture. Simone Leigh will off er visitors a timely opportunity to gain a holistic understanding of the complex and profoundly moving work of this groundbreaking artist in one of the country's few free public institutions devoted to contemporary art. Opening in May of 2024 , the Museum will host the largest U .S. exhibition of works by the Brazilian duo OSGEMEOS . This world -renowned street -art duo draw on their interests in hip -hop, American graffiti, and Brazilian folk art to create imagined worlds populated by distinctive cartoon -like characters. Their work combines a surreal, playful, and humorous approach with a keen attention to social concerns. Visitors will experience the full breadth of the artists' 30 years of creative output, including paintings, immersive installations, v ideo works, and sculpture. 105 In addition, t he HMSG continues planning for large -scale immersive exhibitions to celebrate the Museum's 50th anniversary in October of 2024 with installations highlighting the Hirshhorn 's extraordinary collection holdings. Also in FY 2024, i n support of the strategic goal to expand access to the Smithsonian's d igital content , the Museum's website will engage with local and remote audiences about exhibition offerings, upcoming public programs, and information on collections a nd artists. Featured content will include audio and video from public programs, interviews with artists and curators, and searchable access to the collections. The Hirshhorn's communication s and marketing efforts will diffuse deep knowledge of contemporary art and culture, not merely describe actions and exhibits in superficial terms. In addition, t he Museum continues to publish original catalogues to complement exhibitions, along with other books that examine modern art, design, and cultural shifts of the early 21st century . Using Hirshhorn Eye! (Hi! for short), a revolutionary , in-gallery art guide that applies image -recognition technology to scan art and instantly provide access to exclusive artist videos and inside information, staff have increased interaction between visitors and the digital resources of the Museum. Hi! content is updated regularly in coordination with rotating exhibitions. In FY 202 4, the HMSG will continue to create and deliver content that builds on these in-gallery exh ibition learning aids. In addition, the innovative Hirshhorn Eye! technology will provide more in -depth content for the recently released Collections Catalogue . By scanning high -quality photographs, readers will be linked to artist interviews, additional viewpoints, and related content that could not be included in the published book. The HMSG will continue to offer public programs for visitors with varying levels of art experience and cultural interests, and by expanding the concept of a museu m as a learning center. Local artists lead workshops for K -12 teachers and students. They will present ideas and inspirations to people of all ages through the \"Meet the Artist\" programs and \"In Conversation\" interviews and panel discussions. The Museum wi ll draw upon a wide range of artists, researchers, and experts to provide interpretive tours. In concert with educational foundation sponsors, the Hirshhorn will reinvigorate the ARTLAB+ program to create workshops where local teenagers can explore digital media. The Museum will re -launch the \"Gallery Guides\" program to bring advanced art students into the galleries to aid visitors' critical experience with art on display and develop the students' own education obje ctives and teaching skills. The Hirshhorn will also launch pilot programs to reach preschool -aged children, families, and underserved audiences through increased accessibility programs offered in Spanish and American Sign Language. The HMSG will also continue collections research in the Museum's state -of-the-art Conservation Lab and collections storage space. The upgraded spaces have improved natural light to enhance collections management and conservation activities. In addition, the Hirshhorn will advanc e research and preserve time -based media ( such as film, digital video, and audio artworks ) by integrating the work of conservation and exhibits to improve the presentation and stewardship of the analog and digital time -based media. The Museum 106 will also continue to photograph and catalogue the collection to make it more accessible via search features on the HMSG website. The Museum will merge the functional with the artistic by including artists and designers in discussions with facilities staff. This will involve revitaliz ing the Sculpture Garden and re-envisioning the way that the plaza and gallery spaces are used as we approach the Museum's 50 th anniversary year . These projects will enable the Hirshhorn 's physical plant to support the Museum's mission and its expanded programming and collections, as well as enhance the visitor experience and address infrastructure needs. The new Garden will create an are a for large -scale contemporary works and performances within intimate spaces where visitors can enjoy the Museum's many modern masterpieces. Finally, the HMSG will continue improv ing long-range program planning reviews to enhance resource allocation, funds management, and more effective cost sharing with outside organizations to support major exhibitions and programs. By identifying and working with partners in the private sector, the staff will leverage the Museum's federal appropriations to the maximum extent possible. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 202 4 budget request includes an increase of $ 283,000 that provides $226,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff , and $ 57,000 to support anticipated higher costs for off -site leased collections storage space, which are also referenced in the Fixed Costs section of this budget submission .

Also in FY 2023, t he NMAfA will continue renovations to the second -level facilities area for supporting staff, and increase the visibility of and public access to Museum assets , including the education program areas, the renowned Warren M. Robbins Library , and the Eliot Elisofon Photographic Archives, which are all dedicated to helping the public learn more about African art. Phase 1 improvement s include a new conference room and lecture hall with technology to provide b etter on-site and online public accessibility. The renovation plan repurposes the current architecture to minimize costs while improving spatial work flow and efficiencies. This st aged, multi -year renovation project has been designed to permit ongoing access to current facilities. 109 In addition, the Museum is working with the Freer and Sackler Galleries of Asian Art to create new , fire-rated storage space s and modify existing fire -rated spaces to meet current life-safety codes. In pursuit of this goal , the NMAfA has completed three phases of its main storage master plan and is using resources from the Smithsonian's Collection's Care and Preservation Fund ( CCPF) to finish more phases of this work. Several technology modifications are under way to support both on -site and virtual exhibitions and program access. Museum s taff are adapt ing exhibition technology to permit touchless capabilities, as well as deve loping new digital technologies to create virtual gallery experiences. The NMAfA is exploring the potential to link this technology to the Museum's webpage and include add -ins such as artist or curator tours, other contextual information, and access to a new, online NMAfA store. Also, t o further enhance the in-person experience, the Museum has begun upgrad ing all exhibition fixtures and lamps with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) throughout the building . The LEDs installed in two first-floor galleries to date improve the lighting's energy efficiency and reduces the facility's utility costs . The NMAfA also continu es to process its award of a $1.5 million five-year implementation grant from the Lilly Endowment , Inc. to support the Museum's Global Religions of Africa Initiative. Africa's global religious practices on the continent and in its diasporas engage with verbal, visual, and performing arts and offer strategies relevant to the urgent issues of our day. This initiative focuses on educ ational programming, community outreach, and audience engagement through on -site and virtual programs. Endowment - funded programming is designed to enhanc e diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion (DEAI) in program s and offerings, as well as to bette r represent voices and communities of faith. The grant includes contract support for a project coordinator and four paid internships per year. MEANS AND STRATEGY The NMAfA catalyze s new methods of engagement with larger audiences \u2014 including with stakeholders historically engaged with the Museum as well as new, first -time visitor audiences \u2014 by working to ensure that every home and classroom has access to the Smithsonian's digital co ntent . Through its expanding digital strategies, the NMAfA will emphasize enhanced learning styles, introduce new language content , and improve accessibility for differently abled visitors . The Museum has also launched a phased Web redesign that will addre ss accessibility, offer content in additional languages, and present exciting NMAfA resources for educators, art enthusiasts, and students world wide. As part of this redesign, the Museum will also offer teacher s new tools in multiple languages and produce more visual content to reach diverse audiences. The website redesign continues in support of the strategies to expand the Museum's social media presence on multiple platforms and reach a broader range of long -term audiences as well as new audiences and s takeholders. New digital stories will be developed and shared on the Museum's website, the NMAfA interface on Google Arts and Culture, via the Smithsonian Voices blog, in addition to other social media platforms which broaden the reach of the Museum's work and increase its visibility. The Museum will also continue digitiz ing its art and photographic archive collections to make them available to the public via the portals on the NMAfA website. This will increase 110 public access to its collections through enh anced navigation features via eMuseum and multi - media applications, and by completing additional image and object catalogue records for the NMAfA 's public access database. The Museum works closely with the Office of Digital Transformation and the Office of the Chief Information Officer to embark on a large -scale , mass -digitization project that will add a substantial number of new object records to the online collection database. Conservation and registration records are also being digitized and added to the Institution's database network. The N MAfA will continue to broaden visibility , prepare future programming that attracts more visitors , and seek visitor feedback on exhibitions and programs , using visitor comments, docent interactions, and surveys of its public programs . Collaborative projects initiated by the NMAfA include working with Smithsonian units on best practices in program development, internships, and audience assessment. In October of 2022, the NMAfA made its first deaccession of collections under the Smithsonian's new Ethical Returns and Shared Stewardship Policy by formally transferring ownership of 29 Benin bronzes to the National Commission for Museums and Monuments in Nigeria. The bronzes, which had been part of the Museum's collection, were stolen during an 1897 British raid on Benin City. The Institution's Board of Regents voted to deaccession the bronzes in keeping with the new policy , which authorizes the return of Smithsonian c ollections to the community of origin, when appropriate, based on ethical considerations such as the manner and circumstances in which the items were originally acquire d. The NMAfA will continue to participate in the process for restitution and repatriatio n of colonial -era and looted collections objects. In the future, t his collaboration will forge connections with colleagues at African museums to share information, develop mutually beneficial partnerships, and address questions of DEAI in the United States and worldwide. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 202 4 budget request includes an increase of $ 220,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff funded under this line item . NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 General trust funds support staff salaries, benefits, and travel. The Museum raises contributions from individuals, foundations, and corporations to support activities and programs such as the Paid Internships Initiative, the ongoing NMAfA Women's Initiative, and the Global Religions of Africa Initiative. In addition, grants, donations, and sponsorships fund special projects like e xhibitions, education programs, and publications. The Museum has expanded its offerings and increased fund raising to support new projects, such as collaborative programs with partner African museums, multi -year curatorial residencies, and participation in professional development training that increase s both domestic and international peer perspectives, welcomes new voices , and raises the visibility of art from the African continent around the globe. 111 ANACOSTIA COMMUNITY MUSEUM APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 2 593 2 340 0 245 FY 2023 ENACTED 17 2,949 3 612 0 100 0 210 FY 2024 REQUEST 20 3,434 3 636 0 200 0 100 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage in impactful scientific research and discovery 3 242 3 258 0 16 Digital Transformation Provide improved digitization and audience engagement 2 530 4 779 2 249 Education Provide education support to engage and inspire diverse audiences3 422 4 595 1 173 Public Programs Provide relevant reference services and disseminate information to the public 1 180 1 185 0 5 Exhibitions Offer compelling, first-class exhibitions 2 450 2 460 0 10 Collections Improve the stewardship of the national collections 3 421 3 437 0 16 Facilities Operations and Maintenance Improve facilities operations and provide a safe and healthy environment 1 346 1 351 0 5 Security Provide world-class protection for Smithsonian facilities, collections, staff, visitors and volunteers 0 75 0 75 0 0 Management Operations Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure 2 209 2 219 0 10 Information Technology Improve the Institution's information technology systems and infrastructure 0 75 0 76 0 1 Total 17 2,949 20 3,434 3 485Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change 112 BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT Since its founding in 1967, the Anacostia Community Museum (ACM) has been a catalyst to help people in urban neighborhoods voice their concerns about city life, examine their role in society, and encourage local cultural expression. As the Smithsonian's first community museum, the ACM is uniquely positioned as a trusted bridge between organizations, academia, government, businesses, and community members, which together give voice to previously untold perspectives and uncover novel solutions to the problems of urban living. MEANS AND STRATEGY In 2023 and 2024, the ACM continues to expand its programmatic offerings. The Museum is in the third year of a five -year initiative, Transforming America, that looks at five issues through the lens of racial equity, with 2023 and 2024 highlighting issues of the envir onment and public health. The 2023 exhibition To Live and Breathe: Women and Environmental Justice in Washington, DC celebrates ordinary women making extraordinary change through the lens of \"where we live, work, play, and pray.\" Environmental toxins, de adly viruses, and climate change threaten all of us, but they have a disparate impact on people of color and anyone who cannot afford to leave dangerous jobs or move away from neighborhoods with high levels of pollution or flooding. The COVID -19 pandemic a nd recent severe climate events have laid bare what women have long discussed at kitchen tables around the country. The stories in this exhibition provide us with inspiring examples of women who face great odds but are tireless in their efforts to protect their families, neighbors, and communities. As part of this focus, the Museum will host four anchor public programs which highlight environmental themes and mark key community commemorations, as well as expand our programming to include more offerings for families and seniors. Key to the Museum's Year of the Environment will be the launching of the ACM's Center for Environmental Justice. The Center will use a humanities -based framework that places traditional scientific research and data in the context of daily life and offers a range of community -based programs, including the inaugural Environmental Justice Academy funded by the Coca -Cola Foundation and the Women's Environmental Leadership (WEL) network and summit. In addition, the ACM continues to provi de more direct service for people experiencing food insecurity by hosting the Feed the Fridge program. This program placed a fridge on the Museum grounds and filled it five days a week with prepared meals for anyone in need. During 2021, the community frid ge fed more than 8,000 residents of the city's Wards 7 and 8. In 2024, the ACM will launch its education -themed exhibition tentatively titled A Bold and Beautiful Vision, focusing on the significance of Washington, DC arts educators as catalysts for local and national artists and cultural workers. The ACM plans to expand its community engagement reach by collaborating with the Charles 113 Sumner School Museum and Archives, and the DC History Center \u2014 to install three exhibits, one at each site, focusing on the history of the struggle for equal education for children of color in Washington, DC. In addition, the ACM will continue to enhance its online presence with a defined social media strategy and amplify the Museum's programmatic offerings. In 2023, the ACM implemented its impact statement and prioritized audiences by incorporating it into our program planning. As part of this process, the impact framework is being used to develop and evaluate the upcoming exhibit To Live and Breathe: Women and Environmental Justice in Washington, DC . This evaluation will provide vital information on the effectiveness of our content and whether the Museum is having the desired impact on our audiences. Even though the Museum has reopened to the public, the ACM will continue t o develop and implement online content as well programs that may take place off Museum grounds. These types of virtual and off -site programs allow the ACM to better meet audiences where they are and expand outreach as a community -based Museum. The ACM is committed to improving the stewardship of and increasing public access to its collections. The Museum's major priority is to continue digitizing collections and developing its online portal to make hundreds of high -quality images and records available thro ugh the Smithsonian's Collection Search Center and The Museum System (TMS) database. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes an increase of $485,000 that provides $89,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff funded under this line item, and a programmatic increase of 3 FTEs and $396,000 for digital transformation and education support. Digital Support (+$239,000, +2 FTE s) The FY 2024 request includes funding for a new digital content manager (+$110,000, +1 FTE), who will lead the strategy for ensuring that ACM content and digital resources reach and serve the needs of the diverse ACM community. This position will allow the Museum to broaden its reach to new audiences and create and maintain an online presence that leads to awareness and increases in -person visitation. In addition, this position will coordinate existing content from researchers and scholars and rewrite content for the ACM's digital, marketing, and outreach programs to build public awareness of and increase engagement with the Museum's audiences. The position will involve working across multiple platforms, including the Smithsonian intranet, public social media and crowdsourcing platforms, and e -newsletters. The FY 2024 request will also support a digital curator (+$129,000, +1 FTE) to research and produc e digital resources and exhibitions in the Museum's major content 114 areas, which focuses on community life in the Washington, DC region. The ACM approaches curation of community life through the following core content areas: arts, environmental justice, famil y histories, historical achievement, and community activism, encompassing a broad swath of issues which include housing, education, and public health. The digital curator will create digital companion exhibits for those in the Museum's gallery as well as i ndependent digital exhibits such as the first standalone online exhibition, We Shall Not Be Moved: Stories of Struggle from Barry Farm - Hillsdale , which expanded the Museum's audience. The digital curator would also program the ACM's recently launched Outdoor Projector Program that uses recurring digital art exhibitions and introduces a new digital gallery experience for the public to extend the Museum's reach beyond its limited physical exhibit space. A di stinguishing programmatic approach is the engagement of local, national, and international artists with ties to the region who, in their own artistic practice, form a dialogue with the Museum's core content areas. Additionally, the program seeks to amplify and deepen the public's interpretation of African American and Washington, DC -based artists with works in the ACM's collections by using a collections -based curatorial approach. Education Support (+$157,000, +1 FTE) The Museum educator position will as sist the ACM in developing and implementing programs aimed at community members in the metropolitan Washington region, including Maryland and Virginia. Programs will be developed for youth and family audiences and may take place at the Museum or off site i n conjunction with community partners. The purpose of the programs will be to better connect the ACM with local communities by sharing content focused on the humanities. NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 The ACM's financial strength is closely tied to its strat egic revitalization. Recently, for the first time in more than a decade, the Museum hit its fundraising target. In FY 2024, through the development of a comprehensive fundraising plan, advancement staff will leverage the ACM's success in 2023 to inspire cu rrent donors and attract new ones through its community focused mission and vision. Key areas of fund raising will support the Center for Environmental Justice and exhibits, public programs, and school programs, including digital content and experiences fo r To Live and Breathe , A Bold and Beautiful Vision , the 2025 exhibition focused on public health, and the 2026 exhibit commemorating the nation's 250th anniversary. The ACM will also leverage the institutional campaign as a key component of the Museum's fundraising strategy. 115 ARCHIVES OF AMERICAN ART APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 0 0 FY 2023 ENACTED 14 2,097 2 689 17 2,506 0 0 FY 2024 REQUEST 14 2,180 2 644 17 2,804 0 0 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Digital Transformation Provide improved digitization and audience engagement 1 139 2 388 1 249 Public Programs Provide relevant reference services and disseminate information to the public 1 138 1 138 0 0 Exhibitions Offer compelling, first-class exhibitions 1 70 1 70 0 0 Collections Improve the stewardship of the national collections 9 1,280 8 1,114 -1 -166 Management Operations Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure 2 470 2 470 0 0 Total 14 2,097 14 2,180 0 83Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT Founded in 1954, t he Smithsonian 's Archives of American Art (AAA) is the world's pre -eminent and most widely used resource for original papers and other primary records documenting the visual arts in the United States. By collecting, preserving , and making available more than 30 million uni que letters, diaries, photographs, financial records, sketchbooks, scrapbooks, and the like, AAA embodies the Smithsonian's mission for \"the increase and diffusion of knowledge .\" To achieve the Institution's strategic initiative to ensure that every home and classroom has access to the Smithsonian's digital content, AAA continues its 116 ambitious digitization program, established in 2005, to provide online access to a significant portion of its holdings. By digitizing entire archival collections and fulfilling digitization -on-demand requests from researchers , in FY 2024 AAA will make hundreds of linear feet of material freely available and searchable online . In addition, the Archives will continue to engage in comprehensive and systematic collection assessment surveys to inform the strategic initiative of developing stewardship practices that ensure the preservation and sustainability of our collections for future generations. As part of th is effort, AAA continues to decreas e the backlog of unprocessed collections in both audiovisual (AV) and born-digital holdings. AAA will provide a nimble, cost -effective , and responsive administrati ve infrastructure by regularly assessing and enhancing staff development and maintaining conscientious oversight of internal controls. MEANS AND STRATEGY AAA will achieve the Institution 's strategic initiative to be a trusted source of information that explores the American identity by representing the American experience and diversifying our exhibition s online and in the Donald W. Reynolds Center . As part of this effort, AAA is working with the National Portrait Gallery to co-curate the exhibition Felix Gonzalez -Torres: Angel of History , which is scheduled to open in the fall of 2024 ; and collaborating with the Smithsonian American Art Museum on the exhibition Subversive, Skilled, Sublime: Fiber Art by Women , opening in May of 2024. These exhibition s address the strategic goal of creating One Smithsonian , with collaborative programmin g and, in the case of the fiber-art exhibition, promot ing the American Women's History Initiative (AWHI) . The Archives will advance the Smithsonian's role as a trusted so urce in ongoing efforts to enhance collection catalog ue records and finding aids with inclusive and conscientious description and subject tagging related to artists from historically under -represented communities . This includes participating in the Institu tion's reparative description projects and learning best practices from other units and committees, such as the AWHI's gender and metadata working group. In FY 2024 , with lessons learned from the Smithsonian's experience with the COVID -19 pandemic, AAA will refine its means of conducting remote oral history interviews . Using portable kits funded by the Alice L. Walton Foundation , Archives staff will conduct remote interviews and focus on under -represented artists. AAA will reach new audiences through its monthly podcast, Articulated: Dispatches from the Archives of American Art , which draw s on the breadth and depth of AAA's oral history collection while incorporating multiple points of view from external part ners. In addition, the Archives will continue to host virtual events which tell an expansive story of art and the American experience while highlighting its mission to preserve these primary sources and make them available to the public . 117 In FY 2024 , with ongoing support from the Terra Foundation for American Art and other funding streams in the private sector , AAA will add an estimated 150,000 digital image files online. The Archives will also develop its internal digitization and Collections Information System ( CIS) application to ensure proper collections documentation and support increasingly complex workflows, as well as to provide proper logging and accessioning of materials in born-digital formats . Together, t hese efforts will enable AAA to track the life cycle of all materials from pre -acquisition to storage and access. In addition, the Archives will work with staff in the Office of the Chief Information Officer to leverage its investment in the description, digitization , and management of its collections by participating in ArchivesSpace, SOVA (Smithsonian Online Virtual Archives), the Smithsonian's Enterprise Digital Asset Network ( EDAN ) architecture, the Digital Asset Managem ent System (DAMS), the Smithsonian Transcription Center, and other Smithsonian digitization initiatives . Furthermore, i n FY 2024 , the Archives will process all new collection s and at least 10 percent of AAA's backlog , or about 1,000 linear feet of archival collections , resulting in new, fully searchable finding aids on AAA's website. Finding aids will provide online access to many previously hidden collections , with a focus on the records of art galler ies as well as on the papers of women, Latinos, and Asian Pacific artists and arts organizations. System workflows will continue to integrate accelerated processing and preservation strategies to diminish the current backlog and prevent a new backlog. AAA's audiovisual archivist will review workflows for the acquisition, preservation , and description of and access to AV formats. This review will drive plans to digitize large quantities of at -risk digital formats and advance AAA's role in the new Institution -wide Audiovisual Media Preservation Initiative (AVMPI) . In addition , the Archives will continue to strengthen its collections stewardship through ongoing, comprehensive collections assessment surveys for manuscript collections , photographic materials, and at -risk AV and born -digital holdings. R eports generated from this data provide valuable information about AAA's holdings so the Archives' staff can make informed , shared decisions about the best way to allocate limited resources. AAA will continue taking a leadership role in working with the larger Smithsonian archival community to initiate and implement Institution -wide collections assessment strategies and systems. In FY 2024 , AAA will support researchers by providing access to its collections and microfilm in the Archives' Washington, DC research center, as well as other U.S. research centers . AAA staff will offer remote reference services through the Web-based \" Ask Us\" form , and continue to digitize legacy microfilm on demand, thereby expanding a new revenue stream . Also in FY 2024, AAA will establish a new , two-year residency position for an entry -level archivist to assist with accessioning, collections stewardship and processing, refer ence services, and digital projects. This position will include opportunities for professional development and mentorship. 118 Finally, the Archives will focus on increasing the flexibility of its administrative functions to make them nimble . By continuing to implement the strategic initiative of \"Our Shared Future,\" AAA will increase the efficiency of its processes, generating more effective and integrated solutions. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE This FY 202 4 budget request includes an increase of $83,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff funded under this line item. NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 General trust funds support AAA's advancement office, including salaries and benefits. Donor /sponsor -designated funds support specific programs and projects, including exhibitions, internships, production of oral history interviews, collections and media processing, and publication of the Archives of American Art Journal . In FY 2024 , the Archives will continue work ing closely with its diverse advisory board to position this publication as the leading scholarly journal in the field of American art history. During the past eight years, AAA has increased the number of outstanding su bmissions, raised the visibility of the journal, strengthened the Archives' relationship with the University of Chicago Press, and established more cost -effective, multiyear contracts for design and printing. Also, in FY 2024, the Archives will continue to develop strategies for sustaining its digitization program by growing its endowment to support essential staff and implementing improved rapid -capture technologies and techniques. Funding from the Terra Foundation for America n Art , the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation, and other donors support s AAA's ambitious digitization program. The Archives will continue to raise money from the private sector for digitization, oral history projects , collections management, and general operating expenses. In response to the Smithsonian's initiative to build and enrich a national culture of lifelong learning by engaging with educational systems nationwide, AAA will continue to develop and broaden its teaching with primary sources program with the goal of making the Archive's digital resources active in undergraduate course s and graduate seminars across the United States . AAA will also expand Fellowship opportunities by piloting a short -term visitor program open to all researchers with a compelling reason to consult original primary sources , including curators, artists, independent scholars, undergraduate and graduate students, as well as scholars with academic affiliations . 119 NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTOR Y AND CULTURE APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 4,419 44 24,372 0 0 FY 202 3 ENACTED 155 35,767 24 6,640 51 29,920 0 7 FY 202 4 REQUEST 155 36,886 26 6,972 54 31,416 0 0 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage in vital arts and humanities research 23 5,139 23 5,300 0 161 Digital Transformation Provide improved digitization and audience engagement16 3,895 16 4,017 0 122 Education Provide education support to engage and inspire diverse audiences 18 3,219 18 3,320 0 101 Public Programs Provide relevant reference services and disseminate information to the public 21 6,333 21 6,531 0 198 Exhibitions Offer compelling, first-class exhibitions 18 4,379 18 4,516 0 137 Collections Improve the stewardship of the national collections 19 4,012 19 4,137 0 125 Facilities Operations and Maintenance Improve facilities operations and provide a safe and healthy environment 5 810 5 836 0 26 Management Operations Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure 26 4,860 26 5,012 0 152 Information Technology Improve the Institution's information technology systems and infrastructure 9 3,120 9 3,217 0 97 Total 155 35,767 155 36,886 01,119Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change 120 BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT The National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) was established by Congress in 2003 to document, collect, conserve, interpret, and display the historical and cultural experiences and achievements of African Americans. Since opening in 2016, the NMA AHC , both in person and virtually, continues to provid e a meeting place for all people to learn about the history and culture of African Americans and their contributions to American life. Th e Museum seeks to help all Americans and others around the world to understand these contributions, and in so doing, stimulate a dialogue about race and help foster a spirit of reconciliation and healing. As the only national Museum devoted exclusively to documenting and exploring African American history and culture, t he NMAAHC bridges a major gap in our national memory by creating exhibitions and programs which focus on a wide arc of history and look deeply into slavery, Reconstruction, the Harlem Renaissance, the great migrations of African Americans before and between the World Wars, the civil rights movement, and other significant issues of the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries . The Museum also celebrates African American creativity and cultural expressions through art, dance, sports, theater, music, and literatur e. The NMAAHC's building, exhibitions, digital technology, and Sweet Home Caf \u00e9 are all award -winning entities, and the Museum's shop and caf \u00e9 both continue to enjoy large crowds. The Museum will be welcoming its nine millionth visitor in the spring of 2023. In FY 202 4, the NMAAHC will mark the continuation and expansion of major initiatives which fulfill the mission of looking at American history through the lens of African American history and culture: the building of a national collection; c ontinued development of information technology and digitization programs; and the development and continued implementation of a robust research and education programming initiative \u2014 through both virtual and in -person resources. MEANS AND STRATEGY In FY 2024, the Museum's top priorities are to make long -term enhancements to its scholarly output , education al outreach , and digita l programs \u2014 all while continuing to build the national collection . This includes growing domestic and international partnerships to generate additional support for the Museum; designing and developing temporary and traveling exhibitions for display throughout the United States; expanding scholarly research in all areas of African American history and culture; and developing robust virtual and in -person programming for the public, educators, and students. Also i n FY 2024, the Museum's office of digital strategy and engagement will continue expanding the NMAAHC's global audience reach, engagement, and impact. The Museum will research, design, and develop new digital experiences using emerging technologies to enhance interactive educational programs, promote engagement with visitors, and help make the collections, exhibitions, programs, and educational resources more accessible to a global audience. Furthermore , the NMAAHC will continue to expand its interactive, Web, and mobile offerings to provide innovative and engaging digita l experiences that deepen the 121 connection between visitors and the Museum's collection through bold storytelling and introduce our diverse audiences to themes which are both timely and relevant in today's world. In 2023, the NMAAHC continued to build on the success of The Searchable Museum, a multiyear initiative to make all content accessible through an intuitive, responsive, and accessible online platform, by releasing two new exhibitions : Making a Way Out of No Way and Spirit in the Dark, along with relat ed educational content and additional digital resources. In addition, The Searchable Museum 's new features include digital experiences drawn from the Museum' s permanent exhibitions, including Defending Freedom, Defining Freedom: Era of Segregation 1876 -1968 , and its latest special exhibition, Afrofuturism: A History of Black Futures . New \"digital -only\" experiences will build on The Searchable Museum initiative in FY 2024 and further realize the Smithsonian strategic goals of ensuring 1) every home and cl assroom has access to the NMAAHC 's digital content , and 2) being a trusted source of information that explores and grapples with America's past, present , and future . In FY 2024, NMAAHC curators will continue to acquire artifacts, fine art, archival materials, photographs, film, and other media assets for the Museum 's permanent collection. Curatorial research will contextualize objects from a historical and contemporary perspective, with the aim of reckoning with our racial past through interpretive exhibitions, digital projects, publications, symposia, and public programs. Projects currently in development include publications on African American athletes and photography; books and digita l publications related to the Museum's 10th anniversary in 2026; and an exhibition with a companion publication about African Americans and the White House. In addition, the Center for the Study of Global Slavery's exhibition, In Slavery's Wake : Making Bla ck Freedom in the World is scheduled to open in the Museum's special exhibition s gallery in 2024 and will then travel internationally. In Slavery's Wake explores the wider international history of slavery and colonialism, and the way it transformed geographies, societies, economies, and concepts of race and identity. As part of the exhibition development process, the NMAAHC and its partners conducted a public conversation and oral history initiative called Unfinished Conversations. These filmed conversations around the lasting legacies of slavery and colonialism in contemporary life will inform a new globally shared archive that speaks from the perspectives of the descendants of those formerly enslaved and colonized peoples . The Museum now co -owns, with the J. Paul Getty Trust, the physical Johnson Publishing Company Archive and will continue to process, digitize, and make digitally accessible more than four million of its images, including photographs published in Ebony and Jet magazine s. The NMAAHC will also continue p lanning to move the collection from Chicago to a new research center in Washington, DC when digitization is complete. The initial online portal is scheduled to open for the public in early 2024. Digital Humanities, an interpretive method and type of project based on the intersection of scholarship, digital tools, and technology, will be incorporated into projects to provid e new and innovative ways for visitors to engage with the Museum's collections and i nterpretive content. In FY 2024, NMAAHC staff will continue to focus on recent acquisitions and undigitized objects to improve the features and functions of the Museum's collection information and cloud -hosted digital storage and delivery systems, 122 as well as online user interfaces. These enhanc ed systems will be used in connection with the NMAAHC 's digital -first strategy to drive visionary, interdisciplinary research and scholarly projects. The Robert Frederick Smith Center for the Digitization and Curation of African American History will continue to deliver public programming, digitization of community -based collections, Fellowship programs, and visitor engagement through the Explore Your Family History Center and the Community Curation Program \u2014 an online platform for members of the public to share personal stories through digitized images, video, and audio, along with digital media resources from the Museum's community and institutional partners. The NMAAHC will also continue offering online audiences cur ated and community -generated selections of digital collections in the Museum's virtual environment. The NMAAHC will keep work ing to make 100 percent of the Museum's collections accessible to the public online, adding to the more than 18,000 items now available, and ensure that all digitized collection records and images for unrestricted materials are freely available via the Digita l Public Library of America. The NMAAHC will also add new features and resources for the more than 3,000 objects in the collection now available through the Open Access Initiative . The Museum will increase access to the Freedmen's Bureau records by continu ing a multiyear effort with the Smithsonian Transcription Center to provide searchable, full -text transcriptions of the records, which are now linked to a genealogical index. This will include working with partners to conduct Transcribe -a-Thons, where volu nteers help transcribe historical documents. In addition, the NMAAHC continues to offer compelling, first -class exhibitions and engage and inspire diverse audiences. In early FY 2023, the Museum opened a temporary exhibition entitled Spirit in the Dark: R eligion in Black Music, Activism and Popular Culture. This exhibit examines Black religious life through a selection of photographs from the Johnson Publishing Company . The images in the exhibition spotlight noteworthy individuals \u2014 including religious and political leaders, musicians, authors, athletes, activists , and educators \u2014 and are supported by diverse objects from the Museum's collection, many on display for the first time. Also in FY 2023, the NMAAHC began explor ing ways to further realize the potential of the Museum's second -floor space: Explore More! The NMAAHC en vision s this space as an integrated, state -of-the-art gallery that uses technology and programming to engage visitors of all ages, and provide them with the opportunity to deeply explore educational themes, family genealog ies, the Museum's media offerings, library, and other featured collections. While many of the current individual elements are successful on their own, the NMAAHC will address issues of functionality, flow, connectivity, and presentation to improve the visitor experience. This project is set to be completed by the fall of 2026 to coincide with the Museum 's tenth anniversary. In 2023 and into 2024 , the NMAAHC will present the next large -scale temporary exhibition, Afro-Futurism: A History of Black Futures from the Past, Present, and Beyond . This exhibition present s a deep dive into ideas of Black identity a nd representation by contextualizing the African American experience through the perspectives of science, technology, and futuristic principles. Afro-Futurism provide s a template for re -imagining Black futures, unimpeded by the restrictions of racism, and will 123 explore the various people, concepts, themes, and artistry which have given voice to expressions of such a better and more humane society. The Museum will also continue its intensive and comprehensive rotation program to replace loans and at -risk objects within its long -term exhibitions . Typically, the NMAAHC replaces between 200 -300 objects per year on a twice -yearly cycle. The Museum achieves the strategic goa l of building and enriching a national culture of learning by presenting an array of lectures, conferences, community resources, staged readings, film screenings, concerts, and conversations with renowned scholars, thought leaders, musicians, actors, artis ts, authors, and filmmakers. In FY 2024, the NMAAHC's staff plans to increase their national reach and impact by presenting programs digitally and in person, while adhering to necessary health and safety protocols. The Museum will continue to leverage educ ation technology by making resources available by streaming programs \u2014 such as those about Juneteenth and Black History Month \u2014 and will create virtual experiences to enable audiences across the globe to participate. NMAAHC educators will also continue ini tiatives for all audiences by expanding digitally based resources which use the Museum's collections and exhibitions and provid e resources for the classroom and home by offering educator - and caregiver -development opportunities to reach learners where they live and study . The Museum will advance the Smithsonian's educational goals by sharing content about African Americ an history and culture through media, marketing, and social media channels. Media campaigns, audience cultivation and outreach, marketing, communications, and social media are all avenues that the NMAAHC will continue developing to build and maintain its p ositive brand. To achieve the strategic initiative of improving c ollections stewardship , the Museum's office of curatorial affairs will continue to identify, acquire, process, and lend collections while developing, preserving, and refining the m to make the collection more accessible to the public . The NMAAHC has 41,729 objects in its collection and continues to manage offers of new co llections and facilitate a robust review process. The Museum is also enhanc ing its collections -storage spaces and improv ing efficiency with high -density storage equipment and reorganization activities, and regularly coordinates with the National Collecti ons Program. In addition, t he NMAAHC continues develop ing keystone collection documents and standards while reviewing and streamlin ing workflows to be nimble and promote collaborative, integrated solutions. The NMAAHC office of strategic partnerships will advance the strategic goal of making the Museum a trusted source of information by delivering far -reaching and transformative support for African American and African Diaspora history and culture organizations regionally, nationally, and i nternationally. The office work s with its collaborating institutions , provides access to training and resources in support of leaders and best practices , and raises awareness of these projects . In FY 202 4, the NMAAHC will continue its Historically Black Co lleges and Universities (HBCU) History and Culture Access Consortium, a five -year initiative to address issues facing HBCUs and their affiliated museums and archives. This initiative will strengthen the long -term institutional stability of these vital cult ural organizations. The resulting community of best 124 practices will focus on skill -based training for traditionally under -represented professionals , executive leadership training , and collections inventory and digitization. This initiative will culminate in 2026 with a travelling exhibition, aligned with the U.S. semi -quincentennial, to highlight the essential role HBCUs have played to advance American history and identity. Additionally, the NMAAHC will execute a series of virtual and in -person training sessions for museum professionals to strengthen ethical interpretation practices in the field and support environmentally centered community engagement and successful global partnerships. To achieve the goal of improving the Smithsonian 's digital strategy initiative , the Museum will continue building its cloud -based computing environment to create a more cost-effective, flexible, scalable, and secure infrastructure that supports technical innovation s. The NMAAHC will also continue developing digital initiatives, using low -or no-cost, open -source technologies, to enable rapid prototyping while minimizing costs. Also in FY 2024, the Museum will help launch the Smithsonian's climate action plan by designing and installing outdoor gar den spaces to not only recapture groundwater and add to the NMAAHC 's green spaces but also educate visitors about subjects such as food justice, urban farming, and African -American environmentalism. Finally, the Museum will contribute to the strategic goal of building a nimble Smithsonian by continuing to develop its organizational structure and refine its business practices to accomplish program goals. The NMAAHC 's safety and facilities program will continu ally improve health and safety p rotocols, emergency operation s procedures, disaster management plans , and related consolidation efforts .

Behring Center, has the unique and cherished role as the only Museum in the country dedicated to telling the full history of the United States. Through incomparable collections, rigorous research, and dynamic public outreach, the NMAH seeks to empower people to create a just and compassionate future by exploring, preserving, and sharing the complexity of our past. Learning U.S. history helps people understand that today's world is the resul t of myriad choices and actions made by many different individuals and communities across time and place. Increasingly, we understand that knowledge of the past is not a luxury. It is essential for the civic health of our country and for our democracy to s urvive. The Museum is honored to steward the nation's premier history collections, consisting of more than 1.8 million objects and more than three shelf -miles of archival collections. Our artifacts form a fascinating mosaic of American life and make up t he greatest single collection of American history in the world. The NMAH manages a nearly 800,000-square -foot building on the National Mall in Washington, DC as well as collections primarily stored and cared for at the Museum Support Center and the Paul E. Garber Facility in Suitland, Maryland, and at the Pennsy Drive Building in Landover, Maryland. At the heart of the Museum are the employees who care for its audiences, collections, resources, messages, buildings, and scholarship, all in service to the p eople of the United States and their ongoing education. Collectively, the staff create a series of forums, both virtual and in the Museum, where millions of people engage with one another and with inspiring and challenging stories from U.S. history. In our galleries and online presence, we have connected generations of Americans to deeply researched history via an exceptionally broad range of primary sources and material culture. Approximately 1. 8 million people visit ed the Museum in 2022 and more than 11 million guests interacted with the Museum last year through online channels (e.g., via websites, social media platforms, the YouTube channel, and e -news). The NMAH has shared its work in Rapid Response Collecting related to the COVID -19 pande mic, Black Lives Matter , and other protests, as well as the January 6th Capitol attack, through proactive news media outreach and educational offerings. The Museum's exhibitions, collecting, research , and digital work are also covered extensively through m edia campaigns, which in FY 2022 reached a potential audience of 19.85 billion people, with coverage across all national networks, wire services, U.S. and international newspapers and their digital outlets, as well as radio, podcasts, and blogs. MEANS AND STRATEGY The Museum's 10 -year strategic plan (for 2020 -2030) guides the NMAH as it envisions pathbreaking public work to mark the 250th anniversary of the United States in 2026, followed by a full -scale renovation of the Museum's entire East Win g. The plan is organized around the NMAH 's vision to become the country's most accessible, inclusive, relevant, and sustainable public history institution. To fulfill that role by 2030, 127 the Museum will serve an audience that reflects the full racial, class , gender, ethnic, and geographic demographics of the United States. The NMAH is deploying its recently developed state -of-the-field interpretative and collections plans to advance the Museum's overarching strategic plan. The NMAH's vision is a timely reflection of its status as the Smithsonian 's flagship history museum, given the congressionally authorized creation of the Smithsonian American Women's History Museum (SAWHM) and the National Museum of the American Latino (NMAL) , whose goals are inextricably tied to the current mission and work of th e NMAH. The Museum has already established the groundwork for these two new museums through its participation and partnerships with the Institution's American Women's History Initiative (AWHI) and the Smithsonian Latino Center. Accordingly, t he NMAH will c ontinue these collaborative efforts with the new museums and ensure that our combined mutual resources serve audiences in the best possible manner. The fiscal impact of these two new museums on the NMAH will be reflected in future budget considerations. This groundwork is evidenced by the Museum's recent and upcoming slate of public projects that advance the NMAH's commitment to telling the stories of women 's history in innovative ways. Girlhood (It's Complicated), an exhibition that tackles the long and complicated history of girls from all backgrounds, races, and classes, and what it has meant to grow up female in the United States, from the 1790s to the present, begins a national tour in early 2023 . The exhibition mines the Museum's rich collections and covers key topics such as education, wellness, work, fashion, and girls' involvement in American political and social movements. In addition, the AWHI -funded podcast Collected , which launched in 2022, offers compelling and accessible journeys through topics in African American history which are particularly relevant today. The NMAH's connection with the NMAL is highlighted by the traveling exhibition \u00a1Pleibol! In the Barrios and the Big Leagues/En los barrios y las grandes liga s. It takes audiences on a bilingual journey into the heart of the nation 's pastime, vividly conveying how generations of Latin Americans have helped make modern baseball the game it is today. Their inspirational stories gesture toward larger themes in Amer ican history that connect us all, on and off the baseball diamond. The Museum also provided the NMAL with space and assistance to open the Molina Family Latino Gallery at the NMAH in 2022. This 4,500 -square -foot space centers the U.S. Latino experience wit hin America's historical narrative via a series of changing exhibits, the latest in digital technology, and robust educational programs designed for multi -generational audiences. The Molina Family Gallery is the first physical space at the Smithsonian prim arily dedicated to showcasing the contributions of the Latino community in shaping America's culture. The NMAH engage s diverse audiences , nurtur es community partnerships , and advanc es collaborative work across disciplinary boundaries. Recent accomplishmen ts include developing the Center for the Public Understanding of American Religion and continuing the multiyear Undocumented collecting initiative to chronicle the efforts of undocumented people to shape political change. Other related projects involve showcasing the history of the Filipino American community in Stockton, California 128 through the acquisition of a 20th-century ste amer trunk and associated materials; the acquisition of the first Black -owned vehicle to be collected by the Museum , a rare 1932 Ford Model B purchased by Delbert McKinney with his Pullman porter wages; and the public display of the Fight the Virus, NOT th e People banner presented to the Museum by members of the San Francisco Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association. In addition, the NMAH is investing in its digital future as part of the Smithsonian's strategic goal to ensure that every home and classro om has access to our digital content . The Museum is redesigning, migrating, and refreshing its public Web platform for the first time in seven years, based on the identified needs of the NMAH's audiences and staff. The Museum is also developing a plan to d efine new digital -outreach goals and objectives, with a focus on more efficient and nimble workflows, enhanced infrastructure, and better training to increase staff capacity. The NMAH continues improv ing access to and use of its collections through digitiz ation, more descriptive cataloguing, and increased availability of images in the public domain, which allows people to download them in high -resolution formats , for free. The Museum also partner s with the Journal Storage platform known as JSTOR to develop an experimental project that will link NMAH collections to scholarly publications. Recently , the NMAH completed a forward -looking collections plan that enables sustained stewardship and advances a more inclusive and accessible national collection for the American people . This plan creates a shared language and common sense of purpose that will guide decisions about the Museum 's collections' acquisition, stewardship, and utilization. Through deep examination of collections and discussions with colleagues in museums around the world, we are closely examining materials to better care for our most important collections and finding ne w homes for those better suited for specialized or regional repositories. In collaboration with the Smithsonian's National Collections Program and Smithsonian facilities management , the NMAH has prepared design s and begun early work to support the Museum's East Wing revitalization (also known as the Public Space Renewal Program \u2014 PSRP IV); completed design s and begun construction of the Pod 6 collections storage space at the Museum Support Center; and completed the first phase of the most pressing collectio ns inventory and decontamination project at the Garber Facility. Most importantly, the Museum is exploring preventive measures to enhance the resiliency of the main building and protect it from catastrophic flooding. Through these far-reaching, long -term initiatives, the NMAH will continue to promote and enhance the value of its collections ; complete intensive inventory, digitization, and description projects; increase online access; advance cross -institutional collaborations; deploy innovative uses of te chnology; and work to transform its physical infrastructure \u2014 all with the goal of preserving the historical memories of the nation for future generations . The Museum's new interpretive plan provid es direction and focus to create rich and engaging visitor experiences within the NMAH, in classrooms, and on digital channels. The plan recognizes the potential power of the breadth of our audiences \u2014 from visitors, readers, program attendees, students, and teachers to online users, co - 129 creators, community partne rs, conveners, and artists. By engaging with a living past, audiences will recognize themselves as change -makers and see new connections with their fellow citizens. This sense of empowerment and interconnection is basic to the Museum's mission to help the visiting public realize \"a just and compassionate future.\" In FY 2023, the NMAH will continue crafting a multiyear strategy to identify and engage audiences as part of the Museum's public outreach efforts. The NMAH continue s adapt ing to the changing n eeds of pre-K-12 teachers and students. As public schools transitioned back to in -person learning, the need for digital media and downloadable resources remained steady. For daycare centers and other pre-K-serving organizations, the transition has been ch allenging , with both parents and organizations needing supportive print and digital media materials to keep young learners engaged. In FY 2022, NMAH educators continued to add to the thousands of free resources on History Explorer , the Museum 's acclaimed website for teachers. Highlights include Brief and Incomplete: Votes for Women , a 12 -minute , AWHI -funded video that capsulizes for middle and high -school students the long and challenging path to woman suffrage, and Really Big Money , an exhibitio n and classroom curriculum co - curated by historians and educators who use the Museum 's extensive numismatic collection s to help elementary students learn about world cultures and financial literacy. In FY 2022 , the Museum started , and in FY 2023 will continue conducting its 10th National Youth Summit (NYS), with a special focus on the intersection of history and civics that asks the driving question, \"How do the stories we tell about our past shape our democracy ?\" In response to teacher and stude nt needs, the 2022/ 2023 NYS has been divided into a four -part civic education series that spans the 2022/2023 school year. Each part includes a case study that uses Museum objects and artifacts, addresses a supporting question, and includes teacher -and st udent -facing materials. Each case study is supported by a live webinar that provides students with the chance to interact with panelists as well as peers . The webinars are recorded and made accessible for asynchronous use as additional learning resources . The NMAH's NYS provides a unique opportunity to bring middle and high-school students together with scholars, teachers, policy experts, and activists in a national conversation about important events in America 's past which remain relevant to the nation' s present and future. The 2021 /2022 NYS focused on gender equity and drew nearly 5,000 young people from 34 states and at 12 different Smithsonian Affiliate museums across the country . In FY 2023, the Museum opened several new exhibitions which bring the long lens of history to bear on contemporary needs and concerns. Entertainment Nation explores how film, television, music, and sports have served as forums for key national conversations about who we are and who we want to be. ( Re)Framing Conversation s: Photographs by Richard Avedon, 1946 -1965 illustrates how Richard Avedon's iconic portraits speak to the complexities of his time and raise enduring questions for all Americans today. In preparation for the upcoming 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, the NMAH launched the Revolutionary Questions initiative that will 130 culminate in exhibitions, public programs, pre-K-12 partnerships, digital outreach, and other interpretive products to inspire dialogue and reflection around the core questi on: \"How have people come together to make change ?\" Also u pcoming in 2023, Mirror, Mirror: Reflections of America in Disney Parks will explore how Disney has conveyed visions of American identity and history , Treasures and Trouble: Looking Inside a Legendary Blues Archive will showcase a one -of-a-kind blues archive; and \u00a1De \u00faltima hora!: Latinas Report the News will focus on women who contributed to the growth, popularity, and advocacy of Spanish -language television in Latin o communities. In 2024 , Do No Harm will explore a paradox at the heart of modern medicine \u2014 its amazing inventiveness in saving lives and its sobering ability to tolerate, even exacerbate, social inequities in our collective health and well -being. Change YOUR Game will use the Museum's col lections to explore how athletes, inventors, and technology have reimagined and reshaped sports. Also opening will be Coraz\u00f3n y Vida : Lowrider Culture in the United States and Science on Trial , an exploration of the power of scientific evidence in our just ice system. Finally, the NMAH will achieve the strategic goal of creating a nimble and responsive administration by reorganizing the Museum to align its work and human and financial resources with its strategic plan. Staff will focus on demonstrat ing acco untability and efficiencies in the Museum's administrative, personnel, hiring, and governance practices which prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion among volunteers, interns, Fellows, employees, and the NMAH advisory board. The Museum 's Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Access (IDEA) Council is working to establish a more inclusive and equitable business environment , address issues of unconscious bias and racial equity , and develop a long -term training plan tailored to the needs of the Museum and its staff. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes an increase of $ 1,529,000 that provides $1,309,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for e xisting staff funded under this line item, and a programmatic increase of 2 FTEs and $220,000 to expand operational support at the NMAH. Operational Support (+$220,000, +2 FTEs) This budget submission includes an increase of $220,000 and 2 FTEs to bolster the Museum's operational and management capacity. Investing in these positions will improve and support the procurement, communications, budgeting, human resources, and performance evaluation functions of the Museum . We need to devote resources to these important management positions as they are essential to the smooth functioning of NMAH operations . The lack of management support positions at NMAH has required other professional staff to focus on operational tasks instead of performing the jobs they 131 were hired to do. Filling these positions will help the Museum be more cost -effective, nimble, and responsive . NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 General trust revenue sources include space rentals for special events, revenue sharing from business operations, honoraria for speaking engagements, and tuition reimbursements for classes taught by staff. These general trust funds support salaries and benefits for NMAH staff w ho work in administration, advancement, public affairs, and special events, as well as other program costs. In addition, the Museum receives restricted funding through donor/sponsor -designated trust funds (such as gifts, private grants, and endowments) and Government grants and contracts. These restricted funds are used to develop, install, and promote new exhibitions, fund public programs and educational initiatives, and support research, travel, and collection acquisitions. These restricted funds are vita l to complete the renovation of the public spaces in the Museum through the fabrication and opening of new exhibits, such as the recently opened 20 -year exhibition Entertainment Nation , and a temporary rotating exhibition space on the third floor of the building's West Wing. 132 NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 2 645 22 9,756 0 92 FY 202 3 ENACTED 185 36,762 3 1,364 38 13,087 0 139 FY 202 4 REQUEST 185 38,126 3 1,169 28 9,564 0 0 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage in vital arts and humanities research 14 2,696 14 2,799 0 103 Digital Transformation Provide improved digitization and audience engagement 8 1,454 81,513 0 59 Education Provide education support to engage and inspire diverse audiences39 5,720 39 6,008 0 288 Public Programs Provide relevant reference services and disseminate information to the public 15 2,710 15 2,821 0 111 Exhibitions Offer compelling, first-class exhibitions 21 6,255 21 6,410 0 155 Collections Improve the stewardship of the national collections 30 4,784 30 5,005 0 221 Facilities Operations and Maintenance Improve facilities operations and provide a safe and healthy environment 12 2,073 12 2,161 0 88 Security Provide world-class protection for Smithsonian facilities, collections, staff, visitors and volunteers 0 1,214 01,214 0 0 Management Operations Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure 34 6,924 34 7,175 0 251 Information Technology Improve the Institution's information technology systems and infrastructure 12 2,932 12 3,020 0 88 Total 185 36,762 185 38,126 0 1,364Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change 133 BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT By partnering with Native peoples and their allies, the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) fosters a richer shared human experience through a more informed understanding of the Native peoples of America . In keeping with its authorizing statute, t he NMAI is one Museum in three locations: the NMAI -DC on the National Mall, NMAI -NY in lower Manhattan, and the Cultural Resources Center in Suitland, Maryland. However, despite having multiple sites, t he NMAI will continue to focus its resources to support research , exhibits , and programs concerning the cultures and histories of Native communities and to present contemporary works of art to the public. The online and on-site offering s of diverse exhibitions, cultural demonstrations, tribal festivals, educational presentations, and scholarly symposia ensure a meaningful visitor experience at all the Museum's locations and on the World Wide Web. Online content based on these programs wil l continue to expand our reach to distant virtual visitors who may not be able to come to the Museum in person . Through its exhibitions and public programming, the NMAI continues to present the contemporary voices of Native peoples to educate and inform th e public while correcti ng widespread stereotypes. The NM AI will continue to steward the more than one million collection items entrusted to the Museum's care . The collections represent an excess of 14,000 years of history and more than 1,500 indigenous cultures and communities through out the Western Hemisphere and Hawaii. MEANS AND STRATEGY The NMAI is directing its resources to: 1) activities that will increase visitation; 2) public programming and exhibits that will encompass information about the ind igenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere and Hawaii (as mandated in the NMAI enabling legislation) and demonstrate the presence and cultural contributions of contemporary Native peoples; 3) outreach to Native communities, tribes, and organizations through programming that include s consultation s, loans from NMAI collections, online access to collections and content , videoconferences, internships, and publications ; and 4) amplify the civic discourse on issues facing Native Americans by conducting seminars and symposia on matters of public interest . Major e xhibitions opening or under development in FY 202 4 include : Unbound \u2014 Narrative Art of the Plains reflects the dynamic tradition of narrative art among Native nations from the Great Plains. The exhibition traces the evolution of the art form from historic hides, muslins, and ledger books to more than 50 contemporary works commissioned by the Museum . Illustrating everything from war deeds and ceremonial events to notions of modernity and identity, the selected artworks are as diverse as the individuals who created them. The exhibition was featured in NMAI's New York facility in 2016 and will open in an expanded version in Washington , DC on May 20, 2024. A fully illustrated catalogue with scholarly essays will accompany the renewed version of the exhibition. 134 Sublime Light \u2014 Tapestry Art of D.Y. Begay will open at the Museum's Washington, DC location on September 24, 2024. This will be the first major retrospective of D.Y. Begay, an innovative and accomplished Din\u00e9 (Navajo) artist and weaver. Hailing from the community of Tselani, on the Navajo Reservation in Arizona and the Ame rican Southwest, D.Y. Begay is a transformative artist whose work bridges her traditional Din\u00e9 upbringing and lifelong passion to explore Indigenous and non -Indigenous fiber arts. Begay's work helps shift perceptions of Indigenous fiber arts as \"craft\" or \"women's domestic art,\" and places it squarely within the contemporary art world. Know Your Treaty \u2014 NMAI collaborated with Museums on Main Street ( MoMS), a program of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES), to organize regional versions of the NMAI's award -winning exhibition Nation to Nation: Treaties Between the United States and American Indian Nations , curated by Presidential Medal of Honor awardee Suzan Harjo and currently on view in Washington, DC. M oMS works with regional museums to co -create exhibitions relevant to local histories and audiences. The NMAI will support partnerships with pertinent tribes to help tell local stories of Indigenous presence, treaty dispossessions, and ongoing relations today. Regional venues will be booked for 2024. In addition, t he Museum will achieve its education goals by continuing to provide daily exhibit and educational programming about Native peoples of the Western Hemisphere and Hawaii, thereby providing opportunitie s to expand public knowledge. The seven -day-a-week operation will include interpretive activities, film and video presentations, cultural arts performances, demonstrations, and resource materials about Native American history and cultural heritage. The NMA I will also continue working with Native educators and cultural experts on the Museum 's national education initiative , \"Native Knowledge 360 ,\" to create model curriculum materials. In support of this program, the NMAI will offer an array of virtual and on-site teacher professional development resources across the country to provide educators with materials to augment their students ' understanding of Native American history and culture. To promote learning across generations, the imagiNATIONS Activity Cen ters in Washington, DC and New York City will provide bilingual (English/Spanish) interactive learning spaces to introduce aspects of Indigenous knowledge or Native science through tangible examples of their remarkable accomplishments and contributions to the world. The NMAI is also developing related online educational resources to make the centers more accessible for audiences unable to visit the Museum in person . NMAI staff will continue provid ing on-site and online educational programs for groups, schools, and other public audiences , leading presentations in galleries and deploying volunteers in all public spaces and program areas to ensure maximum use of all the Museum's available educational resources to enhance the visitor experience . Public engagement efforts will continue to bring the Museum and its resources to audience s through both on-site and online venues and via innovative outreach and 135 training programs. These contacts will link external communities to public audiences through technology and involve them in NMAI activities and exhibit planning and programming . In addition, the NMAI will keep dedicating re sources to expand access to the Museum's collections on line, providing digital educational resources and developing its website as part of the Smithsonian's strategic digital transformation goal. The NMAI will also continue to hire and retain the highest quality research staff and collaborate with leading institutions of learning and community -based scholars. Museum staff will also disseminate their research to Native American communities and public audiences through the World Wide Web, exhibitions , printed materials, programs, and publications, and will continue to seek collaborative opportunities with other organizations, museums, institutions of higher learning, and Native American communities. Through judicious acquisition, documentation, digitization, inventory, preservation, research, security, storage renewal , and enhancements , as well as loans to museums across the United States, t he NMAI 's staff will continue to serve as a trusted source for information and content in concert with Native communities and cultural experts. The Museum's scholars will also continue to engage the public by increasing digital access to collections for Native communities and hosting virtual workshops. This includes enhancing the collections by acquiring works which document Native experiences and expressive cultures, such as those represented in modern and contemporary arts. In addition, the NMAI will continue to loan collections objects to tribal museums and, where appropriate and in accordance with the Smithsonian's new ethical returns policy , repatriate sacred objects and items of cultural patr imony to their original tribes . Furthermore, the Museum also maintains the National Native American Veterans ' Memorial, which was legislatively authorized and opened on the grounds of the main building on the National Mall in FY 2021. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes an increase of $1,364,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff funded under this line item.

The mission of the NMAL is to give voice to the richness and challenges of the Latino American experience, make it possible for all people to understand the depth, complexity, and promise of the American experience, and serve as a national forum for a collaboration on and celebration of Latino American history and culture for educational a nd social institutions. More specifically, the NMA L will be the keystone institution for people in the United States and visitors worldwide to learn about Latino contributions to life, art, history, and culture in the United States; and will serve as a ga teway for visitors to view other Latino exhibitions, collections, and programming at other facilities and museums throughout the United States. MEANS AND STRATEGY As mandated by P.L. 116 -260, the Museum will illuminate the story of the United States by featuring Latino contributions and provid ing a national resource for the collection, study, research, publication, and establishment of exhibitions and programs about Latino life, art, history, and culture that encompass es, for example : Latino contributions to the early history of what is now the United States of America and all its territories; Latino service in the armed forces from the earliest days of the American Revolution to current military deployment s in defense of our freedoms; Latino contributions to the freedom, well -being, and economic prosperity of all people in the United States through historical movements; the entrepreneurial and charitable activities of Latinos; and the study and appreciation of Latino life, art, history, and culture, and their impact on U.S. society. The Museum will begin to hire the highest quality research staff and collaborate with leading institutions of learning and community -based scholars. The NMAL staff will make research for film, video, audio, and photographic content developed for exhibitions available at the Museum and eventually to public audiences through the World Wide Web, printed materials, and collaborative activities with other groups and organizations. 138 Moving forward, t he NMAL will also establish a planning and coordination structure to develop a projec t schedule for defin ing exhibition emphasis, direction, and composition; form a collections identification and acquisition strategy; coordinat e collaborative efforts with other museums ; creat e a strategic public relations plan and initial materials to intr oduce the new Museum to national and global audience s; develop operating plans ; purchas e needed equipment, supplies, and contractual support; and perform environmental impact and traffic analyses of potential building sites . The NMAL will also further its nimble and r esponsive administration efforts by developing annual operating budgets ; preparing personnel actions and vacancy announcements to hire new Museum staff; organizing a capital campaign office ; and developing a fundraising strategy and implementation plan to identify philanthropic prospects and major gift sources . In FY 2022, the Museum entered the early stages of development by: (1) forming the NMAL Board of Trustees and meeting on a regular basis; (2) selecting a founding director to begin work in early May of 2022; (3) starting site selection for the Museum . (4) forming a Scholarly Advisory Committee to begin meeting in March of 2022; (5) merging the Smithsonian Latino Center with the NMAL and adding new staff to the existing roste r of personnel; and (6) opening the Molina Family Latino Gallery in June at the National Museum of American History (NMAH) , so it can serve as the provisional NMAL until the new Museum opens its doors. In FY 2023, the NMAL will continue these efforts an d focus on staffing, research, outreach, fund raising , and planning for the new Museum to include a site selection and collection plan. In FY 202 4, the NMAL will continue the work of the Latino Initiatives Pool (LIP), which provides funding for Smithsonian -wide projects that support Latino programs and focus on U.S. Latino contributions to science, history, and culture. Pool funds have been used to support exhibition and collections development, public and educational program s, research and publications, digital content, and Fellowships and internships. Projects are selected on a competitive basis, as recommended by a peer - review panel, from proposals that demonstrate cost -effective deployment of pool funds, as well as coord ination with other Smithsonian and external resources. Since its creation in 1995, the LIP has provided in excess of $42.8 million in funding for more than 600 Smithsonian programs and projects. In addition, the Latino Curatorial Initiative has supported 17 Latino curators and eight curatorial assistants at various Smithsonian units. The initiative was designed to increase Latino representation and scholarship at the Smithsonian. Their areas of expertise include archaeology , history, anthropology, America n Studies, archival services , Latino art and design, and traveling exhibition support. Furthermore, the expanded funding of the LIP has broadened the Smithsonian's 139 outreach efforts nationwide. This includes an increased number of traveling exhibitions, public and educational programs, and institutional partnerships. These funds ensure that Smithsonian content is available to more visitors throughout the country and t he world, including new audiences using digital platforms. The LIP funding will continue to support Smithsonian leadership and professional development programs as well. An example of this is the Smithsonian Latino Center's Latino Museum Studies Program (LMSP), which now boasts a national alumni network of more than 350 museum and museum -adjacent professionals and scholars, some of whom are employed at the Smithsonian. Programs such as the LMSP play an important role in creating an extensive pool of qualified museum professionals and a network of cultural specialists at universities, museums, and cultural centers , many of which also collaborate with the Smithsonian. The LMSP recently expanded to include an undergraduate internship supported by The Andrew Mellon Foundation and re -establish ed predoctoral and postdoctoral opportunities for graduate students and scholars. The undergraduate internship focus es on areas of museum work that are often under -represented by Latino professionals . Those areas include museum conservation, digital humanities, museum education, and exhibition design. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request for the NMAL includes an increase of $4,243,000. The increase includes $243,000 for necessary pay and other related salary cost s for existing staff funded under this line item, and $4,000,000 in programmatic increases for 13 FTEs . The program increases are as follows: National Museum of the American Latino (+$4,000,000 , +13 FTEs) This increase will support the initial planning activities for the new Museum in the areas of exhibitions, public programs, collections, and outreach. Extensive programmatic planning, in conjunction with facilities planning, will be necessary so that the NMAL's programs and the eventual design of the Museum building are compatible and enable the NMAL to achieve its intended mission. Planning will encompass the development of strategies for the identification, acquisition, and management of collections and a rchival materials for research; physical and thematic design, composition, and direction of exhibitions; design of a full range of public programs for various audiences; and establishing a n outreach program to address diverse Museum constituencies , includi ng different ethnic groups, schools, families, and cultural and historical foundations. This initial planning work is vital because it will form the foundation for the programs and activities the NMAL offers in the future. Administrative staff will perfor m all necessary purchasing tasks to acquire supplies, equipment, and contractual services; develop budgetary estimates and budget justification material; perform accounting functions; process personnel actions , including hiring and all other personnel services ; and obtain legal advice and opinions. This additional staffing will be essential for the smooth functioning 140 of operations as the workforce and workload of the new Museum grow each year to support opening the NMAL to the public . This increase wi ll also expand the Museum's fundraising campaign department and enable the recruitment and hiring of professional fundraising personnel who will develop a strategic fundraising plan and cultivate donor prospects. The staff for this office will be a mix of federal and trust positions and contractors in accordance with the provisions of P.L. 116 -260 that specifically authoriz es the NMAL to use appropriat ions for fund raising. NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 General trust funds support salary and benefit costs for the Museum director a nd other program -related costs. Donor/ sponsor -designated funds support salaries and benefits for development staff; costs associated with reaching the NMA L's fundraising goals; training of future conservators; conservation of objects for exhibits and community loans; publications and special events for exhibition openings; and costs related to specific programs and projects . 141 NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 1,953 13 4,095 0 0 FY 20 23 ENACTED 57 7,473 3 1,855 17 4,410 0 0 FY 2024 REQUEST 57 7,830 3 1,777 17 4,498 0 0 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage in vital arts and humanities research 3 507 3 526 0 19 Digital Transformation Provide improved digitization and audience engagement 1 248 1 257 0 9 Education Provide education support to engage and inspire diverse audiences 8 917 8 967 0 50 Public Programs Provide relevant reference services and disseminate information to the public 2 280 2 292 0 12 Exhibitions Offer compelling, first-class exhibitions 19 2,255 19 2,373 0 118 Collections Improve the stewardship of the national collections 19 2,528 19 2,646 0 118 Management Operation Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure 5 738 5 769 0 31 Total 57 7,473 57 7,830 0 357Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT The Smithsonian 's National Portrait Gallery (NPG) inspires visitors from around the world by illuminating the American experience through powerful images that connect people and their stories. 142 The NPG strives to bring visitors face to face, literally and figuratively, wit h exceptional Americans and their remarkable stories across time, place, and circumstance. The Portrait Gallery uses diverse approaches in visual biography to focus on changing notions of American identity, and to track evolving ideas about who is signific ant and has an impact on American culture. As a result, the NPG aspires to be widely known as the place that sparks thought and conversation, one that translates factual American biography into a discussion of contemporary issues, and as a resource that in cludes diverse audiences as participants to help define American identity through portraiture and biography. The Portrait Gallery devotes a major portion of its asset s toward increasing the availability and accessibility of the NPG 's collections through e xhibitions, public programs, and publications . The exhibitions explore themes in history, biography, and art in a way that brings out new meaning s and a better understanding of the American experience. The Portrait Gallery's exhibitions in FY s 2023 and 202 4 will continue to support the Smithsonian's American Women's History Initiative (AWHI), examining the contributions of women in shaping America. Support has also been received by the Asian Pacific American Initiative s Pool (APAIP) and the Latino Initiativ es Pool (LIP) to highlight diversity in our programming. Highlights of special exhibitions opening in FY 2023 include : One Life: Maya Lin \u2014 As part of our One Life series, this exhibition is the first visual biography of architect, sculptor, and environmentalist Maya Lin to be presented in an art museum. Known primarily for her initially controversial and ultimately epoch -making Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, Lin has consistently and provocatively explored how we experience and relate to the landscape. Depicting Lin's upbringing, education, and the challenges and triumphs of her impactful career, this exhibition will demonstrate the formative influences that led to her significant contributions to art and architecture and will inspire visitors through the stories of her challenges and accomplishments. The APAIP provided significant support for this exhibit . Portraiture Now: Kinship \u2014 Seven contemporary artists explore intergenerational relationships, whether among blood relatives or friends, to examin e the shifting notions of family. The works evoke the mutable aspect of the kinships they depict, attending to both internal and external forces which affect those relation ships. Njideka Akunyili Crosby and Ruth Buentello portray the effects of migration and transnational lives, while LaToya Ruby Frazier 's photographs of Flint, Michigan depict the impact of industrial neglect on a single family. Jessica Todd Harper probes th e subtle tensions underlying daily interactions between family members. Jess T. Dugan's work explores her relationship with her wife, Vanessa, as they traverse daily life as a queer couple embarking on parenthood. Elsewhere, i n paintings he describes as a \"form of prayer ,\" Sedrick Huckaby addresses the memorialization of family members and loved ones whose lives have been taken by gun violence. 143 Portrait of a Nation: 2022 Honorees \u2014 Displaying recently acquired and commissioned works, this exhibition include s portraits of the newest recipients of the NPG 's Portrait of a Nation award: Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s , Clive Davis , Anthony Fauci , and Serena and Venus Williams. I Dream a World: Selections from Brian Lanker's Portraits of Black Women Who Changed America (Part 2) \u2014 Since the first publication of these images more than 30 years ago, African American women have gained greater visibility on the national stage and in the global arena. Many of the remarkable women featured in thi s two -part exhibition, drawn from Lanker's extensive photographic project of 75 portraits, will be familiar to audiences. They include writers, entertainers, athletes, activists, and politicians. The personal challenges and powerful journeys undertaken by each of these remarkable women should prove inspirational to all visitors. 1898: U.S. Imperial Visions and Revisions \u2014 This groundbreaking exhibition is the first to examine the Spanish -American War , the Philippine American War, and the joint resolution to annex Hawaii through a comparative study of portraiture and visual culture. With support from the LIP and APAIP, t he exhibition will reveal new cultural perspectives which have remained marginal in the histories of this pivotal era . One Life: Frederick Douglass \u2014 Also in the One Life series, this exhibit feature s the pre -eminent African American of the 19th century and one of the nation 's greatest writers, speakers, and intellectuals. Born enslaved, Douglass devoted his life to abolitionism and \"all rights for all ,\" a slogan of his newspaper, the longest continu ally running Black newspaper in the 19th century. He was also the most photographed American of his time and became a national icon through his mastery of the arts of writing, speaking, and portraiture. In addition to permanent collection rotations, in FY 2023 the Portrait Gallery will conclude its immensely popular tour of the portraits of President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama after two final stops at the de Young Museum in San Francisco and the Fine Arts Museum in Boston. The Outwin 2022: American Portraiture Today exhibit will begin its tour at the Orlando Museum of Art in Florida, and planning will commence for a two -venue tour of the upcoming exhibition Brilliant Exiles: American Women in Paris, 1900 -1939 . Within the Portrait Gallery , and with a loan from the Hartley Dodge Foundation, the NPG will install in its America's Presidents permanent exhibition a life -size portrait of Abraham Lincoln by W.F.K. Travers , accompanied by a new tactile component of replicas of the Lincoln life -mask and hands for low -vision visitors. The NPG's combined Audience Engagement team , consisti ng of Communications, New Media, and Education staff, will broaden access to the 144 Portrait Gallery's collections by defining overarching goals and strategies to support each goal, actionable tactics for each strategy , and key performance metrics to measure success. The NPG will also make further strides to raise its national visibility, as well as to increase local attendance and engagement, by pursuing a hybrid model of online offerings and in -gallery programming. The Audience Engagement team will accomplish these goals through targeted outreach, Web, and social media campaigns. Building on the online engagement capabilities developed in recent years, the NPG will serve international audience s with the unique content of its collection of American visual biographies and studies . Demonstrating the diversity of our collection subjects, the Portrait Gallery will leverage social media platforms to attract more followers and convert them to visitors while also expand ing engag ement with international media. In FY 2023 , the NPG will continue to collaborate with its innovative learning groups, the Teen Council , and the Teacher Advisory Board, and use the ir perspectives and knowledge to extend the educational value of the Portrait Gallery 's collection both programmatically and digitally. The Accessibility Task Force will help bring NPG staff up to par with accessibility demands. Other popular programs, inclu ding evening events, curator tours, and exhibition -specific programs and events, will continue to anchor the NPG's educational offerings , both in person and online. The NPG docent corps remains a vibrant and diverse group , well- versed in the collection and trained to engage diverse audiences ; one quarter of the docents are fluent in Spanish and English, and the full corps has successfully made the switch to virtual tours. Explore! , the NPG education space for 18 -month to 8- year-olds and designed to help you ng people explore portraiture as art and history, will continue draw ing more families to the Gallery . The NPG's primary publication projects in FY 2023 are 1898: Visual Culture and U.S. Imperialism in the Caribbean and the Pacific (in the summer of 2023) and Brilliant Exiles: American Women in Paris, 1900 -1939 (in April of 2024). These publications contribute new research to the field of portraiture, highlight the important contributions of individuals to U.S. history and culture, and complement the Gallery 's major exhibitions. In FY 2023 , the catalogue for the NPG exhibition Hung Liu: Portraits of Promised Lands (published in June of 2021 by Yale University Press) won the Smithsonian Secretary 's Research Prize. The Portrait Gallery's publications of fice continues to collaborate with other departments in providing more accessible and valuable digital conten t by editing and manag ing hundreds of bilingual extended object labels and various education materials . The NPG continues its efforts to strengthen collections and will feature prioritized acquisitions of portraits of under -represented Americans. Toward that end, the Gallery is conducting several collections care projects, such as assessing the need for customized cold-storage equipment to safely house its large and oversized color prints while continuing to address cataloguing backlogs; enhancing access to 145 collections by establishing a digitization process for acquisitions; and further promoting the study and appreciati on of its collection of portraits in all media by researchers and the public world wide. The NPG will also improve its conservation capacity by upgrading lab equipment and maximizing the effectiveness of limited c onservation lab space. Gallery staff will co ntinue digitizing collection objects , especially works on paper , and extending the breadth and depth of images , files, and object condition reports in the Smithsonian 's Digital Asset Management System. In FY 2023 , key object conservation work will focus on paintings and sculpture s of notable American women, American Presidents, and treatments for delicate frames of portraits. MEANS AND STRATEGY In FY 202 4, the NPG will continue concentrat ing its efforts and resources to install exhibitions, develop and maintain its collection, expand public education offerings, and pursu e new research directions. The Portrait Gallery plans to reach its audiences in FY 202 4 with an ambitious on -site and traveling exhibition schedule, featuring the following: Forces of Nature: Voices in Environmentalism presents some of the key people \u2014 scientists, politicians, activists, and artists \u2014 whose work has shaped attitudes toward the environment from the late 19th century until today. This exhibit traces a history of environmentalism in the United States from turn -of-the-20th-century conservationism to mid -20th-century environmentalism to current action s on environmental justice and the climate crisis. It uses portraiture, biography , and, when possible, the subjects ' own words to probe this important and complicated history. Star Power: Photographs from Hollywood's Golden Age by George Hurrell features the work of George Hurrell, widely regarded as the pre -eminent Hollywood portrait photographer of the 1930s and '40s. Hurrell created definitive, timeless images of many of the most glamorous figures of cinema' s golden era. With a keen eye for lighting effects and artful posing, he developed a style of present ation whose impact extended far beyond the boundaries of Hollywood and, for better or worse, influenced popular standards of beauty for decades to come. This exhibition will showcase images from the Portrait Gallery 's collection and illustrate Hurrell's special ability to create iconic portraits of legendary stars whose public images were burnished in his studio. Brilliant Exiles: American Women in Paris, 1900 -1939 examines the first four decades of the 20th century when American women made crucial contri butions to the vibrant creative milieu of Paris. Drawn by a strong desire for independence, they crossed the Atlantic to pursue personal and professional ambitions in a city viewed as the epicenter of modernity. Brilliant Exiles will recapture the experien ces of these unorthodox women who found 146 in Paris the freedom to blaze new trails in a variety of fields, including art, literature, design, publishing, music, fashion, journalism, theater, and dance. The NPG will work with the Smithsonian's AWHI on this project. One Life: James Baldwin \u2014 Honoring the 100th anniversary of writer, essayist, and playwright James Baldwin 's birth , this exhibition will create a picture of Baldwin that situates him among a pantheon of cultur al leaders instrumental to his life and legacy. Featured works will present Baldwin alongside other gay civil rights activists who impacted his life , such as Bayard Rustin, Lorrai ne Hansberry, and Barbara Jordan, as well as next - generation artists who were influenced by Baldwin , including photographer Lyle Ashton Harris, writer Essex Hemphill , and filmmaker Marlon Riggs . In addition to these on -site temporary exhibitions, the Gallery will continue the national tour of The Outwin 2022 photographic competition to three locations: the Ackland Art Museum at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill; the Michele and Donal d D'Amour Museum of Fine Arts at the Springfield Museum in Massachusetts : and the Grand Rapids Art Museum in Michigan . The NPG will also prepare Brilliant Exiles for a two -venue tour to begin in March of 2025. The combined A udience Engagement team will continue to reach and educate audiences by defining overarching goals, strategies to support each goal, actionable tactics for each strategy , and key performance indicators to measure success. The NPG will continue to raise its visibility with a brand awareness campaign outlined in a new strategic plan and to evaluate data to better understand visitors \u2014 both in person and online. Staff will accomplish these goals through data- driven evaluation and communications , and continue to build Diversity, Equit y, Access, and Inclusion ( DEAI ) into the fabric of the Portrait Gallery's programs, social media platforms , and the Audience Engagement team . Also in FY 2024 , the Audience Engagement staff will implement the NPG strategic plan by expanding civic engagemen t programs and cementing 10 new partnerships for the NPG. These partnerships will expand existing programs and exhibitions, and create deep, impactful experiences for audiences across the United States. In addition, t he NPG will reimagine the physical design of its Education Center, the Explore! gallery, and the alcove that joins the two spaces, to offer visitors a true museum engagement experience. The Portrait Gallery will build on existing programs by looking to its strategic plan for gu idance on the best way to expand our reach and use data and evaluation to offer a more tailored and engaged experience for visitors. The NPG will also explore options for creating spaces where visitors can participate in civil discourse and think about bec oming more engaged citizens in the modern American experience . The Portrait Gallery' s ma in publication projects in FY 2024 include completi ng exhibition catalogues for Brilliant Exiles and One Life: James Baldwin and develop ing the catalogue for its future exhibition of the work of artist Felix Gonzalez -Torres . With 147 each publication, the NPG aims to broaden access through high-quality printed works which reach far beyond the Gallery's walls nationally and worldwide . The NPG will continue to improve the stewardship of the national collections by providing a fuller picture of the early nation , with further acquisitions of 18th -and 19th - century portraits of under -represented minorities and women and the reinstallation of the permanent collectio n gallery of artworks from 1600 -1900 . This effort includes works never previously on view and features more women and other historically under - represented groups . The Portrait Gallery will also seek to acquir e portraits of contemporary leading figures in d isability rights, the sciences, business, and the arts. The NPG will expand its collection of time-based media artworks while also commissioning more original portraits of all media and continue working with the Digitization Program Office until its entire collection of two -and three -dimensional works is digitized and made accessible to the public and researchers via the Web. Moreover, the Portrait Gallery will support the physical cons ervation needs of the national collection in all media and continue to provide state -of-the-art analysis of works in the permanent collection. Finally, the NPG will continue to focus on its nimble and responsive administration through vigorous efforts to recruit a diverse and professional workforce. The Portrait Gallery will participate in working groups launched by the Under Secretary for Administration to improve Institution -wide policies and procedures for recruiting, contracting, security, and facilities management . As the national champion of American biography, it is vital that the NPG remain open, welcoming, and relevant to all Americans , with accessibility programs to make the Portrait Gallery 's educational initiatives available to all visitors both in person and online. Accordingly, the NPG will dedicate a program specialist to engage the accessibility community about how to improve the diversity of portraiture, cultures, and art. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes an increase of $357,000 for necessary pay and other related salary cost s for current staff under this line item. NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 General trust funds support essential positions and the costs of special events for exhibition openings, loan exhibition development, outreach, fund raising, management, and research. The NPG must support exhibitions, publications, public lectures , gallery programs, symposia, and some collection acquisitions w ith donor/sponsor -designated funds. Private donations are thus critical to the Portrait Gallery 's planning, programming, and ability to deliver on its public mission. It is through a public -private partnership that the NPG achieves its goals and serves the Smithsonian's mission. 148 NATIONAL POSTAL MUSEUM APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 18 3,152 FY 2023 ENACTED 8 2,280 1 109 5 2,800 21 3,510 FY 2024 REQUEST 8 2,343 1 115 5 3,200 24 3,700 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage in impactful scientific research and discovery 1 110 1 114 0 4 Engage in vital arts and humanities research 1 177 1 184 0 7 Digital Transformation Provide improved digitization and audience engagement 1 125 1 130 0 5 Public Programs Provide relevant reference services and disseminate information to the public 1 49 1 51 0 2 Exhibitions Offer compelling, first-class exhibitions 1 132 1 137 0 5 Collections Improve the stewardship of the national collections 3 462 3 481 0 19 Facilities Operations and Maintenance Improve facilities operations and provide a safe and healthy environment 0 888 0 909 0 21 Security Provide world-class protection for Smithsonian facilities, collections, staff, visitors and volunteers 0 337 0 337 0 0 Total 8 2,280 82,343 0 63Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT The National Postal Museum (NPM), with the world 's largest museum collection of stamps and postal artifacts, is dedicated to creating visitor experiences that educate, 149 excite, entertain , and inspire. With more than six million objects, the Museum is respon sible for the Smithsonian's second -largest collection. The NPM dedicates its resources to developing new and innovative ways to explore the vital role of the postal system in American life, and to make its vast philatelic and postal collections available t o all visitors \u2014 both in person and online . The Museum uses its collections in exhibit ions and public programs which educate visitors on the history of America, transportation, communication s, economics , and commerce. The NPM's strategic plan (for the years 2022 -2025) is designed to advance the core strategic directions of the Museum. Many of the strategic objectives assigned to key areas (by management) require Institution -wide cooperation. The t eamwork and processes n ecessary to achieve shared objectives were created by the Museum's management staff. The NPM 's senior leadership gave special attention to the plan for digital outreach and engagement because this area will become increasingly important to the Museum as it develops new audiences and serves as a focal point for national and international philatelic history, collecting, and storytelling. Expanding the research and public output of the curatorial department will enhance the brand of the NPM as a global leader in education and the collection and dissemination of postal and philatelic history. Toward that end, since s ocial media is an ever-increasing and helpful platform for broadening the curatorial impact on philately and postal history , using the World Wide Web to highlight our collection's depth and value will provide better access for the public and scholars , as well as encourage donations to support our work. In addition, the Museum will change how it greets and orients visitors, supports and staffs exhibitions, and creates new programs to attract and serve diverse audiences. The NPM will become a leader in the Smithsonian's effort to embody DEAI (Diversity, Equity, Accessibility, and Inclusion) principles and practices in its operations. This commitment will span both in -house activities (from hiring practices to inter -staff professional communications) and the Museum's outward -looking efforts to develop and attract new audiences. These highlights of the NPM's strategic plan shine a light on the strong potential of the Museum to dramatically increase its reach and impact and continue to be known as a leader in the field of philately . MEANS AND STRATEGY The NPM's primary activities will contribute to the Smithsonian's vision of building on \"its unique strengths to engage and to inspire more people, where they are, with greater impact, while catalyzing critical conversation s on issues affecting our nation and the world\" through the prism of postal communications and philately. These challenges will be met by partnering with other Smithsonian museums and serving as a catalyst for conversations about complex issues; extending the digital reach of the Museum ; understanding and impacting 21st century audiences; contributing to large, visionary, 150 interdisciplinary research and scholarly projects; and preserving our philatelic and postal heritage while optimizing our assets . In March of 2023, the Museum will open its second rotation of artifacts and historic memorabilia for Baseball : America's Home Run , an exhibition exploring America's national pastime. Featuring hundreds of U.S. and international stamps commemorating historic moments and drawing on original artwork and archival material from the United States Postal Service's (USPS) esteemed Postmaster General 's (PMG) Collection, the display of stamps and mail is enhanced by dozens of objects loaned by other Smithsonian museums, law -enforcement agencies, and private collectors. The bilingual, three -year exhibition (running from 2022 -2025) is presented i n English and Spanish with help from the Smithsonian Latino Center and has broad appeal to the public. In FY 2023, the NPM's education and visitor experience department will continue to expand pre -K-12 educational programs and create and expand exhibit -related learning opportunities for both on -site and virtual learners. The Byrne Education Center will continue to support the Museum's enhanced learning opportunities for visiting groups. By focusing on social and emotional learning practices, hands -on activ ities, and civic connections to the Museum's collections, the NPM is well-positioned to help learners make personal connections to Museum content. Throughout FY 2023, the Byrne Education Center will once again be used by the NPM and the greater Smithsonian community for meetings and educational experiences for visitors of all ages. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, the Museum continued to expand its virtual educational programming and resources, and now offers a suite of virtual field trips for students from pre-K through 5th grade as well as recurring virtual programs for early learners and adults. Keeping DEAI practices and principles at the center of the department 's work, nearly all virtual programs include live closed captioning or sign language interpreters, visual descriptions of speakers and images, and recognitions honoring the history and culture s of the region's Native American communities. The education and visitor services department has continued f urther efforts to amplify previously overlooked stories related to historically marginalized and/or under - represented communities with objects in the Museum's collections. At the NPM, federal resources are dedicated to improving the stewardship of the six million objects which represent the national collection of philatelic material and postal history. The Museum's collections team leads efforts to preserve and provide acces s to collection objects on site and online. Since 2020 , the collections department has steadily increased and enhanced the number of object records available online through various initiatives, including a bi -annual publication of new accessions to the Mus eum's website, participating in the Institution -wide open -access initiative, and reviewing never -before - published object records for posting to the website. In FY 2023, the NPM collections staff will build on their accomplishments by continuing to participate in Institution -wide digitization efforts, carrying out exhibition 151 rotations, identifying and consolidating material in storage, processing deaccessions, and maintaining normal business operations. Collections will be made available to Museum visitors, researchers who contact the team for an appointment to see material not on view, and to audiences around the world who can see NPM objects via the Museum's w ebsite. The collections department will also support collections management by developing, maintaining, and preserving the national collection s and making them more accessible to the public. For example, the team will continue to document and add collec tions -related information to the NPM database. The Museum's conservator will carry out conservation treatments on the permanent collection, ensuring that the objects are preserved for future generations. And finally, the team will process new acquisitions to enhance the NPM's ability to fully capture philatelic and postal history. In addition, the collections department will continue to catalogue, image, and conserve the loan of the PMG Collection of original stamp art. The PMG Art C ollection, which began transferring to the Museum from the USPS in FY 2012, represents one of the NPM's most important collections. It includes the original artwork, as well as rejected designs and preliminary sketches, commissioned for more than 3,000 U.S . postage stamps between 1942 and the present. As the USPS continues to transfer new PMG material to the NPM, the collections department will examine, treat, and re -house the collection and process related archival collections. Also in FY 2023, the team will refine collections policies, plans, and procedures due for review , includ ing the Museum's collections management and lending policies and its collections emergency and stewardship plan s. The stewardship plan will guide the content and development of t he NPM 's collection. The collections department will lead staff in a coordinated and uniform direction to draft this plan, which will allow the Museum to gain better control of its collections and ensure th ere are appropriate staff and resources to manage them. Finally, for America 's 250 th anniversary, the Museum will develop and publish a virtual exhibition exploring the history of voting by mail in the United States . EXPLANATION OF CHANGE This FY 202 4 budget request includes an increase of $63,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff funded under this line item. NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 The USPS provides the NPM with an annual grant that supports more than 60 percent of the Museum's core functions and opera tional costs , includ ing nonfederal salaries and benefits, facility maintenance, exhibitions, education, and collection management programs. Fundraising initiatives generate resources from the private sector to develop and support new exhibitions, research opportunities, educational and public programs, and special events. 152 SMITHSONIAN AMERICAN ART MUSEUM APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T GRANTS 2,184 37 9,181 1 136 3 200 FY 202 3 ENACTED 86 11,913 13 2,249 37 9,456 1 140 3 206 FY 202 4 REQUEST 86 12,701 13 2,300 37 9,500 0 0 0 000 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage in vital arts and humanities research 6 797 6 837 0 40 Digital Transformation Provide improved digitization and audience engagement 5 925 5 958 0 33 Education Provide education support to engage and inspire diverse audiences 2 296 2 309 0 13 Public Programs Provide relevant reference services and disseminate information to the public 13 1,655 13 1,741 0 86 Exhibitions Offer compelling, first-class exhibitions 22 3,140 22 3,286 0 146 Collections Improve the stewardship of the national collections 21 2,757 21 3,114 0 357 Facilities Operations and Maintenance Improve facilities operations and provide a safe and healthy environment 1 140 1 147 0 7 Deliver an aggressive and professional maintenance program 0 0 Management Operations Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure 13 1,883 13 1,969 0 86 Information Technology Improve the Institution's information technology systems and infrastructure 3 320 3 340 0 20 Total 86 11,913 86 12,701 0 788Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT The Smithsonian American Art Museum ( SAAM ) is the nation's Museum dedicated to the art and artists of the United States from colonial times to the present. It 153 is the home of the largest and most inclusive collection of American art in the world, a nd its holdings of mo re than 4 8,000 works , span ning three centuries of the nation's cultural development , tell the story of America through the visual arts. The Museum's programs make the collection available to national and international audiences , as well as to those who visit its two historic buildings in Washington, DC: the Donald W. Reynolds Center (DWRC ) for American Art and Portraiture (shared by SAAM and the National Portrait Gallery) and the Renwick Gallery, dedicated to American crafts and decorative arts. SAAM curators and research Fellows -in-residence use the collection and other resources to develop new insights into America's cultural and artistic legacy as well as current themes and explorations . The resulting knowledge drives collections development , exhibitions , associated award -winning catalog ues and scholarly publications, and educationa l programs . The F ellowship program cultivates the next generation of professors and curators. SAAM has hosted more than 800 scholars who now work at academic and cul tural institutions across the United States , Australia, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East , and South America. The Museum's peer - reviewed journal , American Art, serves as a primary venue for groundbreaking scholarship in the field . In addition, SAAM hosts international symposia and semina rs on topics of relevance in the field of American a rt and encourage s a deeper understanding of American art's global connections . In FY 202 4, SAAM will continue to e xpand digital technologies by offering activities to engage users both online and in the galleries . The Museum tak es full advantage of the latest technologies , with a focus on mobile -optimized websites and applications, video production, and social media enga gement. Three videoconference center s deliver the Museum's education programs to classrooms around the worl d. The digitization of SAAM's collection s also continues, allowing the Museum to add new assets and media to support its vast online resources. The Museum continues to produce world -class exhibitions , educational opportunities, and public programs as it works toward our shared Smithsonian future. An ambitious schedule of exhibitions developed in -house and complemented by shows obtained from other organizations attract s new visitors and encourage s repeat visits. At the DWRC , large spaces, shops, and a renovated restaurant greet visitors with a broad range of activities to maintain their interest . The Lunder Conservation Center provides a window on preservation of the nation al collections , and the Luce Foundation Center for American Art displays 3,500 collection objects in an invi ting, visible storage center. SAAM's Renwick Gallery has additional space for exhibitions, public programs, and rotating displays of its permanent collection of American crafts . Multiple traveling exhibitions are shared with other museums throughout the United States, enriching people's lives by giving them direct access to the ir nation's artistic and cultural heritage. National education programs directly reach K -12 teachers and students. These programs use the latest technologies to incorporat e art into social studies, history, and language arts. Resident teacher institutes are supplemented by online/on -demand courses f or the K -12 community. The Museum regularly collaborates with private and public organizations to provide teachers with new resources. In addition, s tudents are brought into the Museum as often as possible to provide that direct experience with the 154 transfo rmative power of great art. The MacMillan Education Center, located in the galleries, serves students across the nation and on U.S. military bases worldwide . Public programs enhance Museum exhibitions and highlight permanent collections with lectures , tours , and gallery talks, as well as craft and sketching workshops . The McEvoy Auditorium hosts four of SAAM's five lecture series and two of its five music series , with additional programming at the Renwick Gallery or in the Kogod Courtyard. The latter space also hosts programs such as family days , heritage months , and art -themed movies . In FY 2022 alone , SAAM hosted more than 100 programs and events. Preserving Our Natural and Cultural Heritage through the lens of American art is at the forefront of all collection activities . Scholarship and research help set acquisition objectives . Gifts of art and p rivate funds raised through advancement activities pay for additions to the national collection . Conservators research methods and tools to preserve the artwork. The Museum's Lunder Conservation Center is an important resource for conservation training and colloquia of interest to the conserv ation community and the public. Conservation Fellowships ensure that experience and knowledge are shared with the larger community of conservation practitioners. SAAM also has a robust safety program to ensure a safe and healthy environment for Museum staff and visitors . The Museum takes a multi -pronged approach to ensuring that Cost-Effective and Responsive Administration supports its mission . Information Technology (IT) staff implement and maintain the information framework on which so many other efforts depend. This includes exhibition space screens and kiosks that provide access to information anywhere, on any device . Managers carefully plan, promote, protect , and conserve the Museum's resources . MEANS AND STRATEGY Research on the collections and related American art topics by curatorial staff continues in support of exhibitions and the permanent collection . Endowments and multi -year private support have allowed the Museum to hire a full slate of curators with specia lties ranging from sculpture, photography , and contemporary crafts to media arts. The Museum's award -winning journal, American Art , will publish three issues of new scholarship . SAAM also hosts approximately 20 research Fellows every year from throughout the country and internationally , thereby increasing the number of scholars using the collection s. The resulting discoveries and interpretations by staff and Fellows help Americans appreciate their diverse cultural heritage as well as advance sch olarship in American art. Research also feeds into educational programs and provides content for the Museum's website and new media . The Museum embraces the Web by making as much of its artwork and related data as possible freely available online to the public. Ninety -nine percent of SAAM's collection is now online . The Museum hosts dynamic websites for visitors, 155 researchers, and educators, most notably through the popular website at AmericanArt.si.edu . SAAM also participates in collaborative digital initiatives with other organizations, using powerful tools such as Linked Open Data (LOD). The publication of SAAM's collections d ata as LOD has established the M useum as a leader in promoting se mantic Web standards in the museum community. SAAM also maintains an active social media presence on many platforms \u2014 including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and our blog, Eye Level \u2014 which engages the public in conversations about art-related topics. The Museum adds dozens of educational videos and live streams to its n on-profit YouTube channel each year and makes these assets fully accessible , regardless of the type of device used. Custom -built interactive exhibition components, a pps, and videos are used whenever appropriate to provide a richer learning experience for visitors. SAAM is planning six exhibitions in FY 2024, including: Sharing Honors and Burdens: Renwick Invitational 2023 The Bi ennial Invitational features artists Joe Feddersen (Arrow Lakes/Okanagan), Lily Hope (Tlingit), Ursala Hudson (Tlingit), Erica Lord (Athabaskan/I\u00f1upiat), Geo Neptune (Passamaquoddy), and Maggie Thompson (Fond du Lac Ojibwe). Together, these artists present a fre sh and nuanced vision of Native American art. Musical Thinking: New Video Art and Sonic Strategies Exploring the powerful resonances between recent video art and popular music , this exhibition focuses on video art that employs the strategies of musical creation \u2014 scores, improvisation, and interpretation \u2014 as well as its styles, structures, and lyrics , to speak to personal as well as shared aspects of American life . Many Wests: Artists Shape an American Idea Ideas about the American West, both in popular culture and in commonly accepted historical narratives, are often based on a past that never was, and fail to consider important events that actually occurred. The exhibition examines the perspectives of 48 modern and contemporary artists who offer a broader and more inclusive view of this region, which too often has been dominated by romanticized myths and Euro -American historical accounts. Composing Color: Paintings by Alma Thomas This exhibit provides an intimate view of Alma Thomas' evolving artistic practices during her most prolific period from 1959 to her death in 1978 . Fighters for Freedom: William H. Johnson Pic turing Justice William H. Johnson 's Fighters for Freedom series from the mid -1940s is a tribute to African American activists, scientists, teachers, and performers , as well as international heads of state working to bring peace to the world. The exhibition is drawn entirely from the collection 156 of more than 1,00 0 works by William H. Johnson that were given to SAAM by the Harmon Foundation in 1967 , and it reminds us that individual achievement and commitment to social justice are at the heart of the American story. Subversive, Skilled, Sublime: Fiber Art by Women This exhibition presents an alternative history of 20th-century American art by showcasing the work of artists such as Emma Amos, Sheila Hicks, and Faith Ringgold, who, stitch by stitch, used fiber materials to express their personal stories and crea te resonant and intricate artworks of beauty and power. As part of its goal to make as much material as possible accessible to the public, the Museum regularly rotates artworks in the permanent collection galleries to show the many facets of American art and culture, as well as to en courage return visits . To supplement t his ongoing effort, SAAM is renovating its galleries with new installations to showcase additional works of art for our diverse audiences . Developed in collaboration between interpretation and curatorial colleagues, American Voices and Visions is the guiding interpretive framework for SAAM's permanent collection galleries throughout the Museum. Transformative additions to our permanent collection presenta tions will include Native American art and a rotating selection of photography. The newly refurbished and reimagined galleries will also feature many new acquisitions which have been obtain ed in accordance with collection strategies designed to expand repr esentation of under -represented artists and perspectives. National outreach includes the touring exhibitions Kara Walker : Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated) ; Fighters for Freedom: William H. Johnson Picturing Justice; Ginny Ruffner: Reforestation of the Imagination; and Printing the Revolution ! The Rise and Impact of Chicano Graphics . Interactive exhibition components keep pace with proliferating information streams . In addition, whenever possible, SAAM loans objects from the national collection to other museums . SAAM continues to develop its highly successful distance -learning program with staff and 2 2 volunteers who create content that reaches classrooms worldwide . Three videoconference center s, including the MacMillan Education Center , enable the Museum to serve more students than ever before . Contracts and p artnerships with Government agencies such as the Department of Defense, the American Battle Monuments Commission, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and Washington, DC public schools also expand the Museum's reach to more diverse audiences. In addition, the Museum created three virtual \"Smithsonian Summer Sessions,\" which are interdisciplinary weeklong experiences taught online to model strategies for learning through art, history, and culture. Since 2020, SAAM has welcomed 530 teachers from 46 states, Washington, DC, two U.S. territories (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands), and nine foreign countries ( including Barbados, Bolivia, Canada, India, Iran, Italy, Mexico, Taiwan, and United Arab Emirates) to this program . SAAM also turned the 157 \"Summer Sessions\" content into three online courses which have enrolled more than 3,200 teachers. The safe storage and display of collection s objects remain a top priority. SAAM continues to develop public interest in and awareness of preservation issues through the Luce Foundation Center and the Lunder Conservation Center and their many public and professional programs . The Museum uses new tools and instrument s to preserve its collection and has l eased cool -storage space to ensure that photographic material is preserved in idea l conditions. Artworks will be acquired to fill gaps in the collection . Time -based media (that is , works exhibit ing a changing observable state , such as film, video s, or lights ) continue to receive special attention in our Time -based Media Lab. Galleries in the DWRC continue to be converted to light-emitting diode (LED) lighting , which is less damaging to the collection and more economical and energy efficient in reducing the costs of maintenance and utilities . The Museum's IT and administrative proc edures close ly monitor resources and processes , resulting in Cost -Effective and Responsive A dministration . Use of the Museum's intranet s ite keep s staff current on the ever-changing procedural and regulatory environment. Finally, SAAM conducts continual review s of work processes and conditions to develop safer techniques and materials for both staff and the environment , as well as the national colle ctions . EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes an increase of $788,000 that provid es $571,00 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff funded under this line item, and an increase of $217,000 in unit rent to support SAAM's collection storage needs, which is also referenced in the Fixed Costs section of this budget submission . NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 Nearly all SAAM 's non -personnel costs, including those for exhibitions, educational and public programs, and purchases for the national collection, are paid with funds provided by individuals, foundations, and corporations. Donor/sponsor -designated funds support specific programs and projects . Additionally, trust funds support salaries and benefits for one-third of Museum staff, as well as all fundraising activities and related costs. 158 SMITHSONIAN AMERICAN WOMEN'S HISTORY MUSEUM APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 0 287 0 153 0 0 FY 2023 ENACTED 22 9,568 2 386 8 1,267 0 0 FY 2024 REQUEST 38 13,778 2 460 4 1168 0 0 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage in vital arts and humanities research 0 0 0 150 0 150 Digital Transformation Provide improved digitization and audience engagement 4 764 5 1,000 1 236 Education Provide education support to engage and inspire diverse audiences3 283 7 1,150 4 867 Public Programs Provide relevant reference services and disseminate information to the public 4 5,557 8 6,360 4 803 Exhibitions Offer compelling, first-class exhibitions 0 100 0 100 0 0 Collections Improve the stewardship of the national collections 3 384 8 1,271 5 887 Management Operations Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure 8 1,139 10 1,758 2 619 Information Technology Improve the Institution's information technology systems and infrastructure 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ensuring Financial Strength Secure financial resources required for Institution's mission 0 1,341 0 1,989 0 648 Total 22 9,568 38 13,778 4,210Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change 159 BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT Public Law (P.L.) 116-260, signed by the President on December 27, 2020, established the Smithsonian American Women 's History Museum (SAWHM) within the Smithsonian Institution. Currently, there is no national museum in the United States devoted to the documentation of wome n's contributions throughout our nation's history. On December 19, 2014, Congress created a commission to study the potential for an American museum of women's history. The bipartisan commission unanimously concluded that the country needs and deserves a n ational museum dedicated to showcasing the historical experiences and impact of women in the United States. A comprehensive women's history museum would document the full spectrum of the experiences of women in the United States, represent a diverse range of viewpoints, experiences, and backgrounds, more accurately depict the history of the United States, and add value to the Smithsonian Institution for the American people. MEANS AND STRATEGY Establish ing the SAWHM will provide the Smithsonian with a significant new vehicle for the collection, preservation, study, and exhibition of programs relating to American women's contributions in various fields and different periods of history which have influenced the direction of the United States; spur collaboration with other Smithsonian museums and facilities, outside museums, and educational institutions; enhance the Institution's ability to reach audiences nation wide through digital resources; and create exhibitions and progra ms to recognize diverse perspectives on women's history and their contributions to the life of our country . The SAWHM will begin hiring the highest quality research staff and collaborate with leading institutions of learning and community -based scholars. The SAWHM staff will make research and content available at the Museum once it is built, and to communities and public audiences through the World Wide Web, printed materials, and collaborative activities with other groups and organizations until then . As work is done on the physical building, the SAWHM will focus on creating virtual content and digital experiences to reach audiences nationwide and advance the strategic goal of ensuring that every home and classroom has access to the Smithso nian's digital content . Moving forward, the SAWHM will establish a planning and coordination structure to develop a project schedule for defining exhibition emphasis, direction, and composition; plan a collections identification and acquisition strategy; coordinate collaborative efforts with other museums ; and devise a strategic public relations plan for publish ing initial materials about the new Museum . This work will be guided by a report issued in 202 2 that examined best practices across the Smithsonian and identified ways that the SAWHM could better attract diverse audiences and support staff. Audience research and focus groups conducted in 2023 have helped the staff better understand what people want from the new Museum , digitally and online. The 160 SAWHM will also develop operating plans; purchas e needed equipment, supplies, and contractual support; and perform environmental impact and traffic analyses on potential building sites. The site -selection process has involved gaining insight through stakeholder focus groups and a national survey, in -depth analysis of potential sites, and consultation with federal agencies and commissions. Additional studies will also be needed to assess and plan for future collections and collecting activities. The Museum will also further its nimble and responsive administration by developing annual operating budgets ; preparing personnel actions and vacancy announcements to hire new staff; organizing a capital campaign office; and preparing a fundraising strategy and implementa tion plan to identify philanthropic prospects and major gift sources. The SAWHM has already received several major donations , including several grant s from foundation s and multiple corporate gift s. The American Women's History Initiatives (AWHI ) Pool, first funded by Congress in FY 2018, officially merged with the SAWHM as part of an organizational restructure approved by Congress in December of 2022. The Initiative will continue to heighten the public's knowledge and appreciation of the transformational role women have played in constructing our national identity and culture , focusing on Institution -wide programming, and supporting all Smithsonian museums with their efforts to increase the repres entation of women in their collections, exhibitions , and programs . As a result, t he Smithsonian Institution, through the AWHI, will: (1) magnify the contributions of women through exhibitions, programs, and educational content; (2) increase the representat ion of women online by building on the Institution's trusted resources; (3) hire staff committed to amplifying the impact of American women's history; and (4) expand the national collection s, both online and on site, to better portray how women have shaped this country. The FY 2021 appropriation included an additional $1 million to expand the AWHI and amplify women's history for local, national, and international audiences. Also i n FY 2021, with federal and non -federal funds, the AWHI hired a director and two data scientists to provide a more sophisticated analysis of collections data on women's history. Since its inception, the AWHI has awarded more than $10 million to 28 Smithsonian units in support of 150+ projects. In FY 2020, the AWHI launched the exhibit Girlhood: It's Complicated at the National Museum of American History. Since then, t he Initiative has continue d to fund the development of the traveling exhibit, which will tour the nation from 2023 through 2025. In addition to th is traveling exhibition, the AWHI has supported 13 Smithsonian -developed exhibitions at museums such as the National Portrait Gallery. In FY 2022, the second edition of the book Smithsonian American Women was published , which shares treasures from the Smit hsonian's collections with people across America. The AWHI also support ed the acquisition of several significant new collection items , and AWHI -funded curators worked across the Institution to make these projects and acquisitions happen. In FY 2022 and FY 2023 , the AWHI has continue d to share women's history with broad and diverse audiences as a part of the new SAWHM . Educational output s include a 12 -page , at-home activity guide for Women's History Month for USA 161 Today , virtual events for early learners linked to Women's History Month , podcast episodes , and public program s centered on empower ing girls to both make change and spark interest in American History. Launched in 2019 through the AWHI , the Because of Her Story (BOHS) Cohort Internship Program is a paid, eight -week summer internship. BOHS interns amplify women's stories to tell a more complet e American history, reach a diverse audience, and empower and inspire people from all walks of life. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the 2021 and 2022 BOHS program was held virtually with 30 interns from across the country at various Smithsonian units. In FY 2024 , these educational efforts will ground SAWHM's outreach to teachers, students, and families. The SAWHM continues to promote research and education via online partnerships and expand its digital work to establish a baseline to guide the representation of American women and girls in the Smithsonian's public digital collections. In addition, the AWHI -funded digital projects will provide gender - inclusive descriptions of collections metadata, which will incre ase the visibility of women and girls in Smithsonian collections online. In FY 2022, the AWHI's efforts to share the stories of American women on Wikipedia generated 260,410 new words and 103 new articles on the site. These specific additions have directly generated 636,935 unique views on Wikipedia ( in the English -language version). To date, the Smithsonian 's open -access images of American women generated 19.3 million views. This work puts trusted Smithsonian resources directly in the hands of the public. Per H.R. 1923 and the \"Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020\" (Public Law 116-330), the AWHI has consulted on the U.S. Mint's American Women Quarters program si nce January of 2021, providing subject -matter expertise and advising on the selection of honorees for the 2022 and 2023 series. In FY 2024, the SAWHM will continue working with the U.S. Mint and the National Women's History Museum in Alexandria, V irginia to recognize the honorees for the 2024 and 2025 circulating quarters. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes a n increase of $ 4,210,000 that provides $210,000 for necessary pay for existing staff funded under this line item and a programmatic increase of $ 4,000,000 and 16 FTEs. The program increases are as follows: Smithsonian American Women's History Museum (+$4,000,000 , +16 FTEs) This increase will support planning activities for the new Museum in the areas of project management, exhibitions, public programs, collections, and outreach. Extensive programmatic planning, in conjunction with facilities planning, will be necessary so that SAWHM programs and the eventual design of the Museum building are compatible and support the new Mu seum in achieving its intended mission. Planning will encompass the development of strategies for the identification, acquisition, and management of collections and archival materials for 162 research; the physical and thematic design, composition, and directi on of exhibitions; preparations for a full range of public programs for various audiences; and establishing a n outreach program to involve a broad range of constituencies that include different ethnic groups, schools, families, and cultural and historical foundations. This planning is essential to establish the foundation for the programs and activities the SAWHM will offer in the future. Administrative staff will perform all necessary purchasing tasks to acquire supplies, equipment, and contractual services; develop budgetary estimates and budget justification material s; perform accounting functions; process personnel actions , including hiring and all other required staffing actions; and provide legal advice and opinions. This additional staffing will be vital to the smooth functioning of operations as the workforce and workload for the new Museum increase each year. This increase will also help the Museum build a fundraising/campaign office, including the recruitment and hiring of additional professional fundraising personnel who will enact a strategic fundraising plan and cultivat e donor prospects. P.L. 116 - 260 establish es the SAWHM and authorizes the Museum to use appropriat ions for fund raising. NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 General trust funds support salary and benefit costs for the Museum director and other program -related costs.

Furthermore, the Smithsonian requests $1,500,000 in funding to support the establishment of a new Educational Initiatives Pool. MEANS AND STRATEGY COLLECTI ONS CARE AND PRESERVATION FUND ($8,197,000) Collections stewardship is a key component and core priority of the Smithsonian's Strategic Plan. Assembled throughout the Institution's 176-year history, the national collections are fundamental to carrying out the Institution's mission and serve as the intellectual base for scholarship, exhibition, and education. Currently, Smithsonian collections total 157.2 million objects and specimens, 148,200 cubic feet of archives, and 2.2 million library volumes, which include irreplaceable national icons , examples of everyday life, and scientific material vital to the study of the world's natural and cultural heritage, covering subjects from art to zoology. The proper stewardship of the national collectio ns is essential for America's artistic, scientific, and education infrastructure, enabling researchers to address challenges facing society, such as the effects of the global pandemic, climate change, racial injustice, and the loss of biological and cultur al diversity and its impact on the world's ecosystems and cultures. To achieve our strategic goals, the Collections Care and preservation Fund ( CCPF ) provides essential resources to make targeted improvements in the accountability, documentation, care, pr eservation, storage, and accessibility of the Institution's vast and diverse collections. With this funding, the Smithsonian continues to strategically address important Institution -wide collections care needs in a pragmatic and systematic manner, based on sound collections assessment data, innovative collections care methodologies, economies of scale, and project -driven activities, including collections moves, re -housing, and digitization. Smithsonian senior leadership acknowledges that an effective strate gy for addressing our collections challenges depends on a coordinated , Institution -wide approach. Holistic collections -level management enable s comprehensive improvements which benefit the greatest number of collection items and collecting units in an effi cient, practical, and cost-effective way. Collections Physical and Digitization Assessments As background, s ince FY 2012, the National Collections Program (NCP) and the Office of Digital Transformation (ODT) implemented an Institution -wide assessment tool \u2014 the Collections and Digitization Reporting System (CDRS) \u2014 to annually assess the state of the collections' physical condition and their digitization status , establish priorities, identify 176 areas where improvements are needed, measure progress, and provide a practical framework for the allocation of limited resources. Based on assessment results, the NCP has used centralized CCPF resources to achieve targeted improvements in the preservation and accessibility of collections in the most efficient and cost -effective manner possible. These funds have enabled staff to correct specific collections management deficiencies identified in the Smithsonian's Inspector Gen eral audit recommendations; enable collections moves from substandard facilities and conditions; replace obsolete, substandard storage equipment; support the management and preservation of the Smithsonian's cryo -collections; improve the preservation and ma nagement of time -based media, digital art, and audiovisual collections across the Institution; and strengthen Institution -wide collections emergency management and professional development. By working closely with the Digitization Program Office ( DPO ), the NCP has also provided essential resources to support the collections care activities required for the success, efficiency, and comp letion of many DPO -supported, unit -driven, mass -digitization projects. Collections Space Planning In FY 2015, the Smithson ian completed a multi -year, Institution -wide collections space planning initiative, includ ing a first -of-its-kind survey of existing collections space conditions . The initiative culminat ed in the Collections Space Framework Plan (CSFP) , which include d recommendations and a 30 -year implementation plan for addressing current and projected Institution -wide collections space requirements in a strategic, integrated, and collaborative manner. The plan is a road map that provides renovation and construction strate gies to address unacceptable collections space conditions, allow for decompression of overcrowded collections areas to make them more physically accessible, anticipate future collections growth, and reduce the Institution's need to lease costly space for collections storage. To address near -term space requirements , the implementation of the CSFP includes : (1) the decontamination of collections in Garber Buildings 15, 16, and 18, including processing, re -housing, and temporary storage in Building 37; (2) the construction of Pod 6 at the Museum Support Cen ter to relocate at -risk collections from the Paul E. Garber Facility, and several Mall museums subject to flooding , as well as p rovide essential temporary swing and permanent collections space for the National Museum of American History ( NMAH ) East Wing public renewal project; (3) the construction of two new storage modules and a hangar next to the Udvar -Hazy Center to support the continued move of the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) collections from s ubstandard conditions at the Garber Facility and the immediate need for temporary collections swing space during the NASM Mall building renovation; and (4) the completion of t he Suitland Collections Center (SCC ) Master P lan. The CSFP, the SCC Master Plan, and the 2021 Climate Change Action Plan support a phased development of the Suitland and Dulles campuses to accommodate the Institution's intermediate and long -term collections space needs. The Smithsonian has robust Institution -wide data on the national collections, their physical condition, state of digitization, and current collections space conditions . When combined, this information provides key tools and direction for improving the management, 177 care, and accessibility of the national collections. In FY 202 4, the Smithsonian will continue to implement collections initiatives and strategically address the preservation, digitization, and storage space needs of collections, based on the results of the Institution -wide physical and digitization collections assessments and the collections space survey. INFORMATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT POOL ($3,187,000) The Information Resources Management Pool support s network operations and server administration , including the Institution's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) financial system. Specifically, the requested funds are used for: upgrades and enhancements to the Smithsonian's information technology (IT) infrastructure ; contractor support in the Network Operations Center ; services of Active Directory and desktop migration technicians ; network hardware/software maintenance ; and delivery of Smithsonian digital assets to the public. RESEARCH EQUIPMENT POOL ($1,300,000) The Smithsonian's ambitious research agenda requires appropriate equipment t o achieve its strategic goals. This basic equipment infrastructure requires regular maintenance, upgrades, and routine replacement. This pool align s with major initiatives and strategic priorities, including: Our Shared Future: Reckoning with Our Racial Past ; Life on a Sustainable Planet ; and My Hometown. The Research Equipment Pool funds have enabled Smithsonian museums and research centers to undertake groundbreaking research in many areas . For example, genomics is offering new opportunities for exploring biodiversity. To be successful, biodiversity genomics requires a set of cutting -edge genetic technologies such as next-generation sequencing. Similarly, the Institution's efforts in materials conservation have been greatly enhanced by using highly specialized equipment that has enabled conservators to better identif y the age and provenance of a rtifacts as well as improve the preservation of fragile materials. Investing in equipment and maintenan ce contracts will allow the Smithsonian to better leverage its collections and expertise in these important areas of research. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE In FY 2024, the Smithsonian is requesting increases of $2,000,000 for the Research Program Initiatives Pool and $1,375,000 for the Digital Support Pool to expand on these Institution -wide priorities. Furthermore, the Smithsonian requests $1,500,000 in fund ing to support the establishment of a new Educational Initiatives Pool. 178 RESEARCH PROGRAM INITIATIVES : $6,400,000 (INCLUDES AN INCREASE OF $2,000,000) The funding requested will continue to support the innovative research pool that is managed by the Under Secretary for Science and Research. The pool fosters a research environment conducive to scientific innovation and provides the essential financial support necessary to execute world -class science. Priority is given to high -risk, high-reward activiti es that lead to new ways of collecting and analyzing data and build technical capabilities within the Smithsonian's established areas of research. Priority is also given to research seeking nature -and community -based solutions to help us live sustainably with nature. This program will help the Institution recruit and retain the finest scientific talent, support postdoctoral researchers, and build a diverse science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce. The funding criteria will be fle xible enough to respond to unique research opportunities that could change our understanding of how Earth systems operate, as well as new discoveries beyond Earth. The funds will be distributed through both competitive and more targeted efforts. We expect to allocate the funding in several tracks; for example, internally competitive seed grants and innovation grants, and start - up funds for new researchers. The funding would also be used to analyze large datasets produced by Smithsonian research in numerous areas, including biodiversity and ecosystems science, astronomy and planetary science , and genomics. There is a definite need for expanded capabilities to analyze the enormous amounts of data generated by our scientists. This request will provide the reso urces needed to address the Smithsonian's strategic goals for digitization; STEM education through citizen science ; and especially drive large, visionary interdisciplinary research projects using large datasets. These funds would help build and support the data platform that can connect collections, research, and global data, making the platform more interoperable and useful for scientists answering complex research questions about important issues of our time. The goal is to develop a collaborative knowled ge platform that connects collections and research data and links it to global data resources using the largest natural history collection in the world. Support for this would represent a major leap forward in our ability to put all the pieces together and identify solutions to many of the challenging problems we face today. Other examples of cutting -edge research to be funded include: One Health (interactions between human, animal, plant, and ecosystem health ); biodiversity genomics (answering questions about ecology and evolution ); movement of animals across landscapes; studying endangered and invasive species ; and how climate change affects all these areas. In addition, in the areas of astronomy and planetary science, the research would includ e how to find evidence of life on other planet s, what conditions lead to habitabilit y, and w hat physical -chemical processes lead to the great diversity among planets in our solar system and beyond . We will also use these funds to help communicate these res ults to the public as only the Smithsonian can, through public programs, exhibits, and educational materials. 179 DIGITAL SUPPORT POOL : $3,500,000 (INCLUDES AN INCREASE OF $1,375,000) The Institution is requesting $3,500,000 overall and a $1,375,000 increase above FY 2023 to continue supporting the Digital Support Pool. Three goals from the Smithsonian's Strategic Plan guide these ambitious efforts: (1) ensure every home and classroom h as access to the Smithsonian's digital content; (2) be a trusted source that explores and grapples with America's past, present and future ; and (3) harness Smithsonian expertise to elevate science in the global discourse . These goals are more important tha n ever, because the recent COVID -19 crisis and national reckoning on race and identity both demonstrated that our citizens and the educational sector have come to depend heavily on the Smithsonian as a trusted source for online content. Our focus on digital content is vital to fulfill our responsibilities on all these fronts. During the COVID -19 pandemic, educators and other digital practitioners across the Smithsonian were able to respond quickly, delivering informative and accessible content and program ming for audiences of all ages. The crisis accelerated some digital initiatives already planned or under way and highlighted new opportunities. Offerings that were only accessible in person, which limited their reach to local audiences, became virtual and available to national and international audiences. One of the Institution's strengths that we want to continue to leverage is our ability to engage people in meaningful dialogue right where they live. As a leader in scientific, cultural, and educational fields, it is essential for the Smithsonian to serve as a catalyst for bringing people together to share big ideas and varying perspectives, especially about important topics that touch all aspects of society, such as race relations, a deadly virus, the health of our democracy, or sustainability in the face of global climate change. The Smithsonian has the special ability and obl igation to increase the public's understanding of our universe, our history, and our shared future, and to work for the common good. These requested pool funds will support Institution -wide digital platforms and programs for sharing our collections and di gital content, such as Reckoning with Our Racial Past , Life on a Sustainable Planet , and Smithsonian: Where I Live , as well as the Open Access Initiative, the digitization program, the central digital transformation function, and volunteer programs such as the Transcription Center which attract thousands of volunteers nationwide every year. In addition, the funding will expand our data science efforts and the information management infrastructure to support the logistics and technology for Smithsonian resea rchers to do their work. This includes continued support of the Data Science Lab that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to extract information from our digitized collections, perform research, and assist curators and researchers i n looking at our objects and specimens in ways that are otherwise not possible, given the massive scale of the national collections. 180 EDUCATION INITIATIVES POOL ( +$1,500,000) The Institution is requesting funding of $1,500,000 for a new Education Initiatives Pool, which would be administrated by the Office of the Under Secretary for Education, to support unit -specific programming, outreach, and projects. Annually, educators across the Institution reach approximately four million people t hrough programing and outreach and our 300+ educators disseminate more than 10 million publications to communities. Smithsonian educators are skilled at curating interdisciplinary learning experiences to support teacher professional learning, design releva nt instructional resources, create student -centered interactives, provide in -person, hands -on engagement, and facilitate structured out -of-school -time experiences. In 2024, the Education Initiatives Pool will support unit -specific education projects and programming and accelerate collaborations with more than 200 affiliate museums and cultural institutions across the nation. In addition, the funding will support our traveling exhibits, which last year reached 156 communities and 41 states. Pool funds are also used to help improve student outcomes and enhance student learning outside of the classroom. To do this, the Smithsonian has embarked on new partnerships with trusted out -of-school organizations to reach millions of young people across the country. The requested pooled funds will support outreach, programming , and engagement with these entities. 181 SMITHSONIAN EXHIBITS APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T GRANTS & 25 3,498 18 262 0 0 0 12 0 98 FY 20 23 ENACTED 25 3,627 18 262 0 0 0 0 0 0 FY 202 4 REQUEST 25 3,806 18 262 0 0 0 0 0 0 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs 2,814 20 2,953 0 139 Collections Improve the stewardship of the national collections 1 138 1 145 0 7 Management Operations Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure 4 675 4 708 0 33 Total 25 3,627 25 3,806 0 179Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT The Smithsonian Institution Exhibits (SIE) office is a full -service exhibit planning, design, and production shop supporting Smithsonian public exhibitions that connect the American people and international audiences with the richness of the Institution's content and collections.

The MCI combines knowledge of materials and the history of technology with state -of-the-art instrumentation and scientific techniques to provide technical research studies and interpret artistic, anthropological, biological, and historical objects. Through its Protecting Cultural Herit age and Preventive Conservation programs , the MCI responds 187 to threats facing cultural heritage in multiple and complex ways . This includes analyzing and consulting on the most appropriate preservation environments , and developing less invasive and more protective storage, display, and conservation techniques . The MCI also suppor ts U.S. agencies and the museum community in identifying illicitly trafficked cultural heritage artifacts and objects and develop ing capacity building initiatives for interna tional cultural heritage preservation . For example, the MCI works with the U.S. Department of State on capacity building programs at the Iraqi Institute for the Conservation of Antiquities and Heritage in Erbil, which support the recovery and conservation of Iraqi and regional cultural heritage artifacts. The MCI, as the only Smithsonian resource for technical studies and scientific analyses for most of the Institution's national collections, brings unique analytical capabilities to Smithsonian researchers, including a central mass -spectrometry instrument core and advanced technological capabilities for analyzing biomolecules. These services are available to Smithsonian units at no charge. In addition to responding to internal Smithsonian requests for consultations , the MCI handles requests from affiliates and outside organizations such as the White House, the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 's Homeland Security Investigations branch , the U.S. Department of State, the FBI , and many other federal, museum, and aca demic agencies and organizations. MEANS AND STRATEGY The MCI is align ing its operations to support the key focus areas of the Institution's five -year Strategic Plan . As part of this alignment, t he MCI will leverage its streng ths to c ontinue developing processes and procedures as part of a Smithsonian - wide transformation . The effort provides the MCI with a path to participate in several of the initiatives under each of the five focus areas of the Strategic Plan and support s the Institution's overall goal to meet the challenges and opportunities of a rapidly changing world. In support of science , the MCI will harness its expertise to elevate the global discourse by collaborating with the Smithsonian's scientists and research centers and providing increased technical and research assistance to Smithsonian arts and humanities researchers, collections, and museums . The MCI will initiate, facilitate, and support the Smithsonian's collaborative research projects by using biomolecular mass - spectroscopy, including biological isotopes and proteomics (i.e., the large -scale study of proteins , particularly, the ir structures and functions). The MCI will also conduct basic research into the mechanisms of material degradation and biodeterioration, preserve cultural heritage , and harness new technologies. The MCI's research programs will cross boundarie s between Smithsonian units as well as support all the Institution 's signature programs and Institution -wide stakehol ders. In addition, the MCI will support the conservation and heritage science fields through publications, hosted symposia, presentations, invitation -only seminars, lectures , and it s website . The Institute will use all these means to disseminate the result s of its research programs. 188 In FY 2024 , the MCI will continue deploying its stable isotope, proteomics, and biomolecular mass -spectrometry capabilities as part of the Smithsonian's central research infrastructure. In particular , the Institute will focus on proteomics , an area of rapid growth in biological and medical research that is being driven by advances i n molecular separation and mass -spectrometry technology. Along with genomics, the field has the potential to rapidly acquire data that speeds the discovery and identification of organisms, the linking of genotypes and phenotypes, and the development of novel biomolecular markers. Proteomics, in tandem with genomics, is expanding our understanding of biological and ecological functions . Building on this knowledge, the MCI is updating its isotope -ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) laboratory to continue support ing archaeological, paleontological, ecological, and environmental studies by comparing the relative abundance of isotopes arising from isotopi c fractionation in natural systems. In short, these capabilities will allow the MCI to gather more information from Smithsonian collections, cultural objects, and biological specimens, and learn more about their materials, origins, and causes of their dete rioration , as well as how to better preserve them . In addition, the MCI will support Smithsonian museums and research centers to improve stewardship and scholarship of the national collections and disseminate collections information to the larger museum community and the public. The MCI will pursue collaborative conservation treatm ent projects with other Smithsonian units to provide conservation guidance and technical consultations to the art and history museums for their more challenging and endangered objects. This will be done by drawing on the MCI's proven track record of establ ishing scientifically based environmental standards for museum collections, detecting unsafe conditions and materials for museum exhibition and storage, and solving biodeterioration problems \u2014 including those that involve buildings and monuments. The Institute is expanding its research in preventive conservation by developing new tools and partnerships that aid in reduc ing deterioration caused by environmental factors. For example, t he MCI has joined IPERION HS, a pan-European research infrastructure on her itage science , and contribut es to research on digital toolkits and apps for modeling and informing preventive conservation. The MCI's photograph ic and paper conservation lab will continue support ing conservation and research for the Smithsonian's fragile and at -risk photographic collections and assess ing and remediat ing hazards to those collections . The MCI will also focus on identifying and using less invasive and damaging materials and procedures for collections conservation, reflecting the importance of incorporating energy -efficient and \"green\" materials and practices into the Institute's work. By working closely with museum conservators, the MCI will identify special training needs and research projects and develop research and symposia to address the most urgent collections preservation needs, such as preventive conservation in museum environments (involving light, temperature, humidity, and pollutants), and museum hazards ( such as pesticides an d hazardous components of collection s). As part of the Smithsonian's Strategic Plan focus on digital initiatives , the MCI will help ensur e a digitally empowered Institution can expand its virtual reach . The MCI 189 will improve digitization support for maki ng Smithsonian research and collections accessible in ways that broaden public access to collections, exhibitions, and outreach programs . In addition, t he Institute will conduct advanced research and develop effective and economical digital imaging technologies appropriate for social media platforms , mobile applicati ons, and virtual reality . The MCI will support the Smithsonian's goal of reaching one billion peo ple by expanding its webpage to engage contemporary audiences an d highlight large, visionary, interdisciplinary research and scholarly projects . Finally, t he MCI will make its research products and records secure and accessible by expanding its use of The Museum System (TMS) and repositorie s such as the Digital Asset Management System (DAMS) and Smithsonian Research Online. The MCI will support the Institution's Strategic Plan efforts to becom e a trusted source for audiences to explore America's past, present and future . Accordingly, t he MCI will provide heritage literature reference s to professionals and the public and its technical information office will continue serving the museum and cultural heritage management communities, museum studies students, and the public. In addition, t he MCI will continue enhanc ing its social media presence to increase the impact of the Instit ute's research and outreach programs. The MCI , in collaboration with Smithsonian museums and Affiliates, will offer public programs to present the results of MCI research, heighten awareness of the problems of preserving cultural heritage, and gather data about the nature and scope of problems that the Institute's clients encounter. The MCI will also collaborate with Smithsonian museums and A ffiliates to offer media events, printed and online materials, presentations, workshops, and demonstrations to reach new audiences, especially those targeted by the Institution's newest museums. As part of the Smithsonian's Strategic Plan focus on education , the MCI will build and enrich a national culture of learning by engag ing with educational systems nation wide. T he Institute will engage and inspire diverse audiences by training higher - education students and professional s. The MCI will also continue to promote career development for Smithsonian conservators and other collections care providers through colloquia, symposia, and workshops, as well as distance -learning opportunities , internships , and Fellowships for students pursuing careers in conservat ion and conservation science . These programs will be grounded in diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion principles both internal and external to the Institution . Through these efforts , the MCI will attract students from a wider variety of backgrounds and encourage them to pursue conservation , conservation science , and other museum careers . To advance this goal , the MCI will continue to support internal Smithsonian programs and the Andrew W. Mellon Opportunity for Diversity in Conservation , stewarded by the UCLA/Getty Interdepartmental Program in the Conservation of Cultural Heritage , to expand a diverse pool of students considering careers in museology, heritage care, and conservation . 190 In support of both the Strategic Plan goals on education and to make the Smithsonian a trusted source of information , the MCI provid es in-kind resources and leads a partnership with the Iraqi Institute for the Conservation of Antiquiti es and Heritage in Erbil, Iraq to train local communities in the safeguarding, recovery , and proactive management of regiona l cultural heritage. Currently, an interagency agreement with the Department of State and other grants support salvage and recovery at the important archaeological si te of Nimrud and other major cultural heritage sites in Iraq as well as development of a n online exhibit with the Iraq National Museum in Baghdad . All Smithsonian projects in Iraq educate the local population in the conservation of their heritage and serve as cultural goodwill ambassadors for the American people . The MCI will also build a nimble and effective Smithsonian as part of the Strategic Plan . In FY 2024 , the MCI will revise its own strategic plan to fully reflect the goals, initiatives, and metrics of the Institution's guidance on properly allocat ing its budgetary and human resources and secur ing additional financial resources for its high - priority programs. To ensure an effective use of funds, r esource allocations will be tracked against performance metrics in each of the strategic areas, and against the needs and goals of the Smithsonian's museum s and research centers. The MCI will encourage staff to participate in budget -performance integration, succession management, and leadership development programs. In addition, the Institute will continue implement ing and communicat ing efficient, rational, and creative operational and administrative practices so staff can advance the Smithsonian mission in a transparent manner that reflects the Institution 's status as a public trust. The MCI will accomplish these goals by maintain ing an efficient, collabora tive, committed, innovative, and accountable workforce through leadership development, evaluation, and support of staff , and the recruitment, selection, and development of diverse, highly skilled employees. The MCI will promote diversity in working wit h the Institution's employees, Fellows , interns, volunteers, and vendors while also improv ing communications with internal and external stakeholders in both the public and private sector s. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes an increase of $181,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff funded under this line item. NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 The MCI receives annual nonappropriated resources from gifts and endowments, grants and contracts, discretion ary income, and business ventures. These sources provide funds for specific programs and projects in research, education, and outreach designated by the donor/sponsor, and for general activities at the discretion of the director of the MCI.

Mellon Foundation challenge grant, provides the salary , benefits, and travel and research funds for the MCI director , with the remaining funds going to strengthen conservation science research. 191 SMITHSONIAN LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 1,418 8 1,417 0 0 FY 202 3 ENACTED 114 16,835 8 1,330 12 2,147 0 0 FY 202 4 REQUEST 116 18,088 13 2,409 12 2,211 0 0 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage and discovery 13 2,035 13 1,648 0 -387 Engage in vital arts and humanities research 32 3,626 32 4,519 0 893 Digital Transformation Provide improved digitization and audience engagement 14 1,928 15 2,137 1 209 Education Provide education support to engage and inspire diverse audiences 1 130 1 135 0 5 Public Programs Provide relevant reference services and disseminate information to the public 4 694 4 721 0 27 Exhibitions Offer compelling, first-class exhibitions 1 147 1 153 0 6 Collections Improve the stewardship of the national collections 35 6,222 35 6,474 0 252 Management Operations Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure 7 990 7 1,034 0 44 Information Technology Improve the Institution's information technology systems and infrastructure 7 1,063 8 1,267 1 204 Total 114 16,835 116 18,088 2 1,253Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change 192 BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT The Smithsonian Libraries and Archives (SLA) appointed its inaugural director in FY 2022. Following orientation, FY 2024 will provide the opportunity to continue successful operations and implement new initiatives. Under this new leadership, the SLA develo ped new organizational structures with redefined priorities to better help the Smithsonian meet existing and new challenges. The SLA serves as the institutional memory of the Smithsonian's unique cultural organization and is responsible for ensuring institutional accountability. The SLA's archival collections document the history of the Smithsonian, from its founding in 1846 to the present, and support the Smithsonian community, scholars, an d the public by acquiring, evaluating, and preserving the records of the Institution and related documentary materials. Accordingly, the SLA manages the care, storage, and retrieval services for the Institution's records in a wide variety of analog and digital formats. SLA staff develop policies, provide guidance for managing and preserving the Institution's vast archival collections, and offer a range of reference, research, and recordkeeping services. Permanent records are safeguarded and preserved in lea sed, specialized environments at facilities in Washington, DC ; Landover, Maryland (Pennsy) ; and Iron Mountain in Boyers, Pennsylvania. Additionally, research library collections are held in the SLA's vast network of libraries from the Republic of Panama to New York City. The SLA's network of 22 specialized Library and Archives Research Centers and the library and archives professionals who select, preserve, and interpret the collections for Smithsonian researchers play a dynamic role in advancing scientific and cultural understanding. These mater ials and the staff who select , interpret, and preserve them support the Smithsonian's mission to increase and diffuse knowledge by providing the Institution and visiting curators and researchers with print and digital scholarly research materials to help advanc e knowledge in their fields. SLA librar ies diffuse knowledge to the public by digitizing important holdings and providing access to Smithsonian -published research and history on the public websites, libraries.si.edu and siarchives. si.edu, and through exhibits, public programming, and educational resources. MEANS AND STRATEGY In FY 2024 , the new SLA director will shape a funding vision for SLA by building on the e xtensive groundwork that has been laid to develop a new integrated SLA culture and redeploy ing staff in an effective and logical organizational structure. With this integrated approach , the following key areas will define the SLA means and strategy for this budget request. 193 Expanding Capacities The SLA's primary goal is to leverage existing capacities and scale staff expertise to meet strategic initiatives of the Institution. Providing SLA services and collections to help develop the two new Smithsonian museums is a signi ficant example in this area. In addition, e xpanding the Institution -wide Audiovisual Media Preservation Initiative (AVMPI), developed by the SLA, and partially supported by the National Collections Progr am (NCP) , will provide the Smithsonian with a state -of- the-art program for the preservation of and access to audiovisual assets. The SLA will remain quick to redirect resources to support new Smithsonian initiatives , interdisciplinary programs, and research areas , but some activities, such as those involving genomics and the larger initiative of Life on a Sustainable Planet (as detailed below) , require expensive resources and staff skills. The following key areas will require an expansion of SLA capacity and resources to achieve the Institution's ambitious goals. Digital Strategies and Infrastructure. A sustainable , robust digital infrastructure that addresses the core needs of the SLA collections and services and improve s digital infrastructure will advance our ability to deliver more modern and expand ed online modes of research, scholarly communication, and public engagement . Key areas of focus will include : 1) a Web portal that integrates content and services from multiple systems to provide a seamless experience for SLA patrons , researchers , and visitors ; and 2) replac ing aging collections information systems with digital platforms to better support research data management, data science , knowledge sharing (such as with Linked Data ), and digital preservation. Linked data systems and technology will improve the SLA's ability to significantly contribute to the broader national and international knowledge communit ies. As part of this effort, the SLA will continue participating in the Smithsonian Open Access Initiative. The SLA will also strategically align its digital infrastructure to enhance and broaden engagement opportunities with audiences in and outsid e of the S mithsonian . Collections , Services , and Stewardship . The SLA supports both library and archives collections as core component s of scholarly research and knowledge creation. Toward that end, the Smithsonian is supported in its mission for \"the increase and diffusio n of knowledge \" by librarians and archivists who maintain the Institution's official records and select, interpret, and guide the staff on leveraging our extensive collections for the benefit of research and the public. Scholarly research at the Smithsonian requires both physical and digital collections , as well as archival research collections. Accordingly, the SLA must be selective to effectively balanc e access needs with the skyrocketing cost of online journals and databases , and to assign limited resources in a cost -effective manner to provide the staff and equipment required to create digital 194 collections. Also, since physical and primary source collections remain vital to conduct deeper , complex research , the SLA follows Smithsonian Directive 600 for guidance on collections management , adher ing to this directive for policies on acquisition and accessioning, deaccessioning and disposal, preservation, documentation, life -cycle management, inventory, risk management, safety and security, access, storage, loans, and intellectual property management . SLA staff also refer to SD 600 for help with makin g electronic and print content discoverable and to address legal and ethical issues which pertain to collections involving shared stewardship and ethical returns, Native American and Native Hawaiian human remains, and objects, cultural property, biological material, and objects unlawfully appropriated during the Nazi era. Supporting Life on a Sustainable Planet . As an important contributor to the Under Secretary for Science and Research 's Life on a Sustainable Planet initiative , the SLA directly assists scientific researchers with projects on biodiversity documentation and loss, conservation of complex ecosystems, human/animal disease vectors, understanding marine and forest ecosystems, and the climate crisis . Archival collections document historic Smithsonian research in these areas as well as uncover previously hidden data. SLA staff support Smithsonian researchers in all science units. As the leader of the global Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL), the SLA leverages its resources by aggregating biodiversity literature to provide Smithsonian researchers and their colleagues with longitudinal observational data, species descriptions, and related information. These data, accessible via the SLA's BHL port al and data aggregators such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), are foundational to understating life on our planet. Education and Engagement . Through a new organizational structure for strategic initiatives and programs, the SLA will align programmatic priorities and goals for education, exhibitions, and engagement (internships, Fellowships , and outreach) to create administrative efficiencies an d more effectively communicate with broader audiences of students, scholars, educators, researchers, and the public . The SLA will expand its current engagement with the Smithsonian's broader educational initiatives to the unit -level education departments and central education programs. Existing SLA internship and Fellowship programs will benefit from central SLA program management, and the SLA will expand the diversity of the intern ship and Fellow ship communities and aspire to fully fund all internship opportunities. Support a Culture of Excellence, Leadership, and Inclusion in the Operations of SLA. SLA personnel will communicate better with their own technology staff , as well as across the Smithsonian , to build upon the Institution's collaborative environment and introduce colleagues to 195 relevant data sets and digital tools and services. The SLA will also renew its efforts to streamline more effective communication about the array of services offered to different stakeholders. Currently, the SLA is creating a workforce plan to prioritize and support its core functions, the Smithsonian's \"new normal \" conditions , and the Secretary 's goals . These efforts will include s upporting communications by encouraging staff and supervisors to reach out and build community across the SLA, review ing SLA knowledge sharing and determin ing where SLA information should be shared , and providing central training and resources for all staff in essential work, software , and workplace knowledge that enhances the \"new normal \" environment. Finance and Administration. The SLA will leverage and extend existing financial resources for maximum value to the Smithsonian by streamlining financial services and providing administrators with clear spending plans and resource needs. The SLA will develop and sustain a skilled and engaged workforce that can succeed and thrive in an ever -changing environment while also nurturing talented archivists, librarians, and staff , as well as foster an organizational culture of innovation, service, and collaboration. External Collaborations. The SLA will build on existing national and global networks to pr omote Smithsonian resources for the public and the scholarly community. Robust involvement with organizations such as the Digital Public Library of America, the Society of American Archivists, the SLA partners in the BHL, the Coalition for Networked Inform ation, Wikidata information, and others promote SLA collections and services and provide a gateway for the Smithsonian to reach a broader community. The SLA will build on existing tools ( such as Smithsonian Research Online and Smithsonian Profiles) and relationships with federal agencies and libraries to address topics of mutual interest, including open science and public access to federally funded research and data . Other external collaborations focus on the SLA's expertise in the areas of museum librarianship and education. A key event for the coming year in this area include s a high -profile hosting of the California Rare Books School (CalRBS) on the Smithsonian 's campus in Washington , DC. In addition, SLA ex perts and external instructors will teach several sessions for postgraduate practitioners working on various issues/topics related to rare books and special collections. Finally, the SLA director is exploring funding options for symposi a to examine the nat ure, impact, and value of museum libraries. These events , to be held at three locations in the United States and United Kingdom , will culminate in the final session at the Smithsonian. 196 EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes an increase of $1,253,000 that provides $714,000 for necessary pay and other related salary cost s for existing staff funded under this line item ; $300,000 to cover the cost of library subscription inflation, justified in the Fixed Costs section of this budget submission; and a programmatic increase of 2 FTEs and $239,000 for digital support . Digital Support (+$239,000, +2 FTEs) The budget request includes funding for two new positions to support digital preservation of libraries and archives materials. Making digitized material open and available to the public requires rights management staff with legal expertise to determine the copyright status of an item. This is es pecially challenging for unpublished material s and orphan ed works, as well as for legacy Smithsonian Institution materials (including scholarly output). Currently, the SLA does not have available staff to focus on this essential copyright and legal researc h work and this request would provide a dedicated staff member for this task . Additionally, t he request will support one position for the SLA's Information Technology (IT) and Web staff to provide digital transformation services and seamless access to our collections, resources, and infrastructure . The necessary growth and modernization of SLA services require a specialist focused on IT infrastructure and technology. Th is additional position will enable the SLA to do the system s development and related work necessary to interopera te and integrate currently siloed Archives and Libraries collections management systems with core Smithsonian technical systems and keep pace with today's increasingly demanding security measures. NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 General trust funds help defray the costs of providing archival and information services to Smithsonian units, support outreach (including publications, social media, and public programs), and fundraising efforts. The funds also support the work of manag ing and preserv ing the Institution's collections and efforts to provide professional conservation expertise throughout the Smithsonian, to ot her institutions, and to the public. In FY 202 4, the SLA will raise funds through its own advancement efforts , which will be supported by even deeper cataloguing of collections and the compelling stories provided by combined SLA activities. In addition, th e SLA will continue to develop its education program and include education among its established priorities of acquisitions, conservation, digitization, internships, Fellowships , and exhibitions . 197 OFFICE OF THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 13 3,262 0 0 0 0 FY 20 23 ENACTED 110 65,035 14 3,249 0 0 0 0 FY 202 4 REQUEST 110 69,466 14 3,359 0 0 0 0 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Research Engage research and discovery 4 2,222 4 2,256 0 34 Digital Transformation Provide improved digitization and audience engagement 15 5,156 15 5,249 0 93 Collections Improve the stewardship of the national collections 11 2,837 11 2,895 0 58 Facilities Operations and Maintenance Improve facilities operations and provide a safe and healthy environment 10 2,096 10 2,131 0 35 Management Operations Enable efficient and responsive administrative infrastructure 26 14,783 26 15,060 0 277 Information Technology Improve the Institution's information technology systems and infrastructure 44 37,941 44 41,875 0 3,934 Total 110 65,035 110 69,466 4,431Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) provides vision, leadership, policy, applications, services, and oversight associated with managing and operating leading -edge information technology (IT) solutions for the Institution's strategic prioriti es, as well as for the Smithsonian's many museums and research and cultural centers. 198 MEANS AND STRATEGY The OCIO will continue using best practices in the implementation, management , and operations of information technology to enhance the \"increase and diffusion of knowledge \".

Administration includes executive leadership provided by the offices of the Secretary and Board o f Regents ; the Dep uty Secretary /Chief Operating Officer ; the Under Secretary for Museums and Culture ; the Under Secretary for Science and Research ; the Under Secretary for Education ; and the Under Secretary for Administration . Other central activities include human resources, diversity, digital transformation, financial and contract management, and legal services . 201 MEANS AND STRATEGY The Smithsonian will continue to use best practices in management to advance its mission for the \"increase and diffusion of knowledge\" and achieve the Institution 's goals while translating James Smithson's 19th-century vision into a modern 21st-century reality . The following strategies are cross -cutting and central to accomplishing the Smithsonian's mission and help promote innovation, research, and discovery : Ensure the financial strength of the Smithsonian and provide the Institution with effective and efficient financi al, contracting, and management support services, including reliable financial evaluation, auditing, and reporting. Provide oversight of the Smithsonian budget process as it is developed and executed to support the operating and Facilities Capital programs of the Institution, establish, and enforce budgetary policies and pr ocedures, and ensure that sufficient resources are available to allow the Institution to achieve its goals . Establish and maintain a comprehensive enterprise risk -management program to identify, monitor, and mitigate risk at all levels. Provide leadership and guidance for Institution -wide collections initiatives, policies, and programs to ensure the proper stewardship of the national collections. Support the Institution's Board of Regents and its committees. Develop and implement necessary internal control s as recommended by the Board of Regents' Governance Committee, which involve s strengthening non-collections property management and meeting increas ed demands for the acquisition of goods and services . Provide legal counsel to the Board of Regents and the Institution on issues such as museum admini stration, intellectual and real property, collections management, contracts, privacy and cyber -security, finance, employment, ethics, conflicts of interest, in ternational agreements, and requests for information . Manage human resources, foster diversity, hire a skilled workforce in a timely manner, and align human capital with the Institution's goals and performance objectives. This includes c onduct ing ongoing w orkforce and performance gap analyses, strengthen ing training and leadership policies and programs, develop ing succession planning, and evaluat ing and improv ing assessment tools for better human resources performance . Provide leadership and oversight for all policies, programs, and activities of the Institution's museums and cultural and research centers by attracting, recruiting, and retaining leaders with superior talent. Provide leadership, support, and resources to enable educators across the Institution to share the depth and breadth of the Smithsonian's collections and research , connect with diverse audiences , invite dialogue and exchange s of different viewpoints , and build on and contribute to best practices in t eaching and learning. Establish and maintain partnerships with the various Administration agencies and initiatives related to under -represented groups, such as Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, Hispanic Serving Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, the American Association of University Women, and Tribal Colleges and Universities, 202 and support the necessary public outreach to enhance the Smithsonian 's presence in these communities . Coordinate the efforts of the Secretary's executive diversity committee, the Office of the Head Diversity Officer (HDO), the Office of Human Resources (OHR) , and the Office of Equal Employment and Supplier Diversity to ensure compliance with federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission mandates, promote the Smithsonian's equal employment opportunity (EEO) and workforce diversity policies , and ad vocate for the use of small, disadva ntaged , woman -and veteran -owned businesses throughout Smithsonian contracting and procurement activities via the Institution's Supplier Diversity Program . EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 202 4 budget request includes an i ncrease of $ 8,045,000 that provides $1,990,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff funded under this line item , as justified in the Fixed Costs section of this budget submission . It also includes a programmatic increase of 25 FTEs and $ 6,055 ,000 for Institution -wide operations support as described in detail in the following sections . Human Resources Support (+$2,5 00,000, +11 FTEs) The Institution will continue its effort to accomplish the ambitious strategic objectives and goals outlined in the Smithsonian 's Strategic Plan. Given the importance of keeping an effective talent pipeline and focus on staff retention and employee engagement, it is vital that sufficient resources be available to support OHR operations so the Institution can lock in progress made to date and ensure continued progress in these areas. The funding requested will provide resources to: hire additional full-time equivalent (FTE) staff who will be responsible for developing procedures and reinforcing accountability mechanism s to ensure that OHR meets and exceeds its workforce targets ; establish a performance management posit ion tasked with contin uing to enhance employee engagement efforts ; develop and implement business process improvement strategies t o reduce the time-to-hire while increasing OHR's capacity to document procedures ; streamline knowledge transfer s among HR spec ialists ; enhance the orientation and training of new specialists for their positions ; and improve recruitment and retention strategies so the Smithsonian can meet our diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion (DEAI) goals . More broadly, the se funds will advance the OHR 's strategic goals by: establishing a more robust performance management program that includes acquiring a new performance management system ; implement ing an Institution -wide workforce planning program to align with its vision for the future of work ; expanding our training options to reduce skills gaps and support our workforce engagement efforts while improv ing our recruitment and talent acquisition processes ; and adding staff to reduce our time to hire. Strengthening OHR is especially important because the current ratio for the be nefits team is one specialist for every 1,090 employees . Adding FTEs to the recruitment and staffing cadre will enable the Smithsonian to align with best practices across Government and provide improved customer service Institution -wide. 203 New Museums Suppor t (+$2,000,000, +7 FTEs) It is essential that the Institution receive funding for operational support of the National Museum of the American Latino ( NMAL ) and the Smithsonian American Women's History Museum ( SAWHM ). The funding required will support centralized functions and services, including hiring the initial Museum personnel, budgeting, finance, and accounting, contracting services, and other general operational support. This funding is vital to ensure an efficient and effective operation in building the two congressionally mandated museums. Without these resources, the Smithsonian will not be able to effectively support the ramp up of activity anticipated in advance of building these two new museums as ordered by Congress. Diversity Supp ort (+$ 800,000, + 3 FTEs) Funding is requested to support the new Office of the Head Diversity Officer to ensure the Smithsonian is fully activating and responding to concerns around diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion (DEAI) . The Secretary cre ated a diversity office at the highest level of the organization to lead these efforts, build community, and engage throughout the Institution. The requested resources will provide the funding to staff the new office and enable it to further develop Instit ution -wide training and guidelines for staff and build the community between the Smithsonian and people with disabilities through targeted outreach strategies. The Institution aspires to embody DEAI ideals in equal measure in both our workforce and externa l programs and continues to expand its reach, both within the Smithsonian and with external stakeholders, including the disability community, the museum field, and disability advocacy and justice organizations. Current staff members' responsibilities and p erformance elements continue to increase in scope as the Smithsonian's implementation of DEAI initiatives grows. The Institution is embedding DEAI practices across our work to make its museums, labs, offices, and boardrooms reflect the nation at large. The new NMAL and the SAWHM will enable the Institution to take additional steps to address DEAI topics. Accordingly, t hese funds will support the Smithsonian's own resources to implement equity and diversity action plans. The requested resources will also support quarterly reporting to the Secretary on progress made with supplier diversity , EEO training, EEO complaints, reasonable accommodations, workforce diversity, and advisory board representation. Digital Support (+$380,000, +2 FTEs) The Institution requests an increase of $380,000 and 2 FTEs to continue developing the \"Virtual Smiths onian\" and leveraging digital capabilities to reach expanded audiences . This funding would enable the Office of Digital Transformat ion to hire new staff members for its central data and customer experience teams that will help develop and implement a Smithsonian -wide, data -informed digital strategy to put people at the center of our digital offerings. By adding this capacity, the Smithsonian will be able to deliver a connected, seamless experience across our entire Institution that is focused on diverse audience s, informed by data, and driven by our ne w Strategic Plan. 204 The additional resources and staff will also support website modernization and digital transformation efforts. It is essential to have the support staff who can better leverage data and technology to serve the public with our digital resources. Our physical museums and research centers attract tens of thousands of visitors every year, yet a strengthened virtual strategy provides an opportunity to reach even more parts of the country and expand our offerings for far larger audiences. Specifically, the additional funds will enable the Institution to advance its goal of ensuring that every household and classroom can access the Smithsonian's digital content. By building a foundation of digital capabilities centered on the customer experi ence, the Smithsonian will develop Web enhancements to meet the needs of the public and provide the greatest educational impact in line with the Institution's mission \"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\" The systems supported by this request are the infrastructure that enables the Smithsonian's collections and other content to be made available to our digital audiences. The funding is therefore crucial to achieve the Institution's transformation goals and strategic priorities. Collections Support (+$375,000 , +2 FTEs) Funds are requested for the National Collections Program ( NCP ) office to support Institution -wide efforts to implement and overs ee the Shared Stewardship and Ethical Returns Program as well as manage other collections issues. The NCP office provides central leadership, policy oversight, strategic planning, and support to Institution -wide collections initiatives. The NCP office will have a critical role implementing the Program, which authorizes collecting units to return collections, in appropriate circumstances, based on ethical considerations. The way a collection was originally acquired, and the context of its acquisition are important considerations. Circumstances demonstrating unethical acquisition may include items that were stolen, taken under duress, or removed without consent of the owner. Additional funding will sustain the NCP office's leadership, coordination, and sup port of current and future collections initiatives, including focusing on innovative collections space planning, collections preservation environments, collections emergency management, and sustainable collections care. NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 Gener al trust funds support salaries and benefits of personnel and other related costs , as well as administrative activities, information dissemination, outreach, publications, and fund raising. Donor/sponsor -designated funds support costs related to programs a nd projec ts such as scientific research , family days, and leadership development. 205 OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 0 0 0 0 FY 2023 ENACTED 23 4,426 0 0 0 0 0 0 FY 2024 REQUEST 25 5,507 0 0 0 0 0 0 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category Performance Objective/ FY 2023 FTEs $000 Management Operations Enable efficient responsive administrative infrastructure 23 4,426 25 5,507 2 1,081 Total 23 4,426 25 5,507 2 1,081 BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT The Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, requires the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) to conduct and supervise audits and investigations relating to programs and operations of the Smithsonian Institution (SI) that are, in the judgment of the Inspector General, necessary or desirable. Furthermore, the Act requires the Inspector General to transmit a budget submission specifyin g the aggregate amount of funds requested for the operations of the OIG, including the amount needed to satisfy training requirements, as well as any resources necessary to support the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE). MEANS AND STRATEGY The Office of Audits conducts audits of the Smithsonian's programs and operations to help improve their efficiency and effectiveness. To align its oversight responsibility with available resources, the Office of Audits develops an annual audit plan by conducting a comprehensive risk assessment of the Institution's programs and operations and seeking input from Smithsonian stakeholders and Congress. The audit plan also includes mandatory audits, such as the annu al financial statements audits that the OIG oversee s. The Office of Investigations pursues allegations of waste, fraud, abuse, gross mismanagement or misconduct, and violations of law that affect the 206 Smithsonian's programs and operations. It refers matter s to federal, state, and local prosecutors for action whenever the OIG has reasonable grounds to believe there has been a violation of criminal law. The Office of Investigations also presents any evidence of administrative misconduct to Smithsonian senior management for appropriate disciplinary action. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes an increase of $1,081,000 to provide $181,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff, and a programmatic increase of 2 FTEs and $900,000 in funding for critical staff and contract audits to address information technology (IT) security and construction expenditures. Management Operations Support (+$900,000, +2 FTEs) The FY 2024 budget request includes an increase of 2 FTEs and $900,000 for two essential positions, a deputy assistant inspector general for audits and a GS-13 auditor, along with funding to cover contract audits to address two high-risk areas (IT security and construction expenditures). The OIG has been paying for the audits of these two high-risk areas with salary -lapsed funds caused by the OIG's chronic staffing shortfalls. However, starting in FY 2023, the OIG will be fully staffed and will need additional requested funds to pay for these annual high- risk audits . The OIG does not have in-house expertise to conduct the IT security and construction contract audit work. NONAPPROPRIATED RESOURCES \u2014 The OIG does not receive any nonappropriated funds. 207 FACILITIES MAINTENANCE APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 116,917 0 0 0 0 0 0 FY 20 23 ENACTED 455 119,258 0 0 0 0 0 0 FY 202 4 REQUEST 465 130,954 0 0 0 0 0 0 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Facilities Operations and Maintenance Deliver an aggressive and professional maintenance program 440 111,358 450 122,949 10 11,591 Security Provide world-class protection for Smithsonian facilities, collections, staff, visitors and volunteers 15 7,900 15 8,005 0 105 Total 455 119,258 465 130,954 10 11,696Performance Objective and Program Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT The Facilities Maintenance program is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the Institution's physical infrastructure and works with Smithsonian museums, research centers , and offices to support approximately 14 million square feet of owned and leased facilities, including 21 museums, nine research centers, three cultural centers, and the National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute . In addition to physical infrastructure, the Institution is re sponsible for more than 25,000 acres of land as well as in excess of 680 buildings and structures , ranging from historical, one-of-a-kind landmarks and well-known museums to essential state -of-the-art laboratories which support global efforts to save endan gered species from extinction and ensure the success of long-term and cutting -edge ecological research. The primary role s of Facilities Maintenance are to provide proper stewardship of the infrastructure required to support the Institution's mission and to mitigate risks which could impede the Institution's operations or the preservation of our national treasures . The program's focus is to provide proper lif ecycle asset management to sustain facilities and infrastructure and prevent failure s which could impact Smithsonian operations, collections and visitor experiences. 208 The Facilities Maintenance program maintains all building systems (including heating, ventilation, and air -conditioning [ HVAC ], elevators/escalators, electrical and plumbing systems , roofing, interiors, exteriors , and the building structure ), site infrastructure, and grounds maintenance associated with Smithsonian properties . The p rogram also maintains systems related to electronic security , including access control and intrusion detection, visitor/staffing screening equipment, intercom systems , and perimeter barrier equipment. The program's mission is to provide proper infrastructu re stewardship by operating and maintaining a safe, secure, and healthy environment to enhance the Smithsonian experience for all visitors. As new and renovated museum and research center spaces open, maintenance requirements rise due to increased square footage, technological advances , and the growing number of infrastructure -supporting systems . These systems are made up of assets with added functionality, new technology, and a new, more complex level of maintenance requirements . The Facilities Maintenance Program benchmarks its staffing and service levels with other museums and professional organizations to ensure financial and personnel resources are being effectively employed. These includ e meeting Association of Physical Plant Administrators standards, which are most commonly applied to educational and federal facilities, and the requirements set by the International Association of Muse um Facility Administrators and the International Facility Management Association. MEANS AND STRATEGY The Smithsonian continues to pursue a long-term facilities maintenance and repair program, incorporating a cost -effective mix of planned, preventive , and predictive maintenance as well as reactive, corrective actions. The Smithsonian's goa l is to reduce its deferred maintenance backlog , currently estimated at $1.76 billion, through the coordinated efforts of its Facilities Maintenance and Facilities Capital programs. Proper maintenance funding prevents the accelerated degradation of buildi ng systems and components to reduce the n eed and cost f or major repairs. Through proper preventive maintenance , and by addressing identified deficiencies in a timely manner, the Institution can realize the anticipated useful life span of facilities systems and avoid the accelerated degradation of infrastructure and resulting higher costs . The Smithsonian will continue to identify efficiencies in managing existing resources to improve its current level of maintenance service in the most cost - effective manner possible . In addition, the Smithsonian will make further progress to improve electronic security systems and physical security measures which protec t the Institution's facilities, collections, staff, visitors, and voluntee rs. 209 EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes an increase of $11,696,000 that provides $3,096,000 for necessary pay and other related salary costs for existing staff funded under this line item, as well as a programmatic increase of 10 FTEs and $8,600,000 to address deferred maintenance, contract cost increases, and declining facilities conditions. Details concerning this request are as follows: Facilities Maintenance (+$8,600,000, +10 FTEs) The Smithsonian requests an additional $8,600,000, including 10 additional FTEs, to improve facilities management practices, slow the growth of deferred maintenance backlog, reverse the decline of facilities conditions, and provide acceptable space for Smithsonian exhibits, research, collections , and staff. The Institution's facilities conditions have declined, resulting in adverse impacts to Smithsonian operations, collections , and visitor experiences. Coupled with growing inflationary factors, the deteriorating facilities conditions have caused Smithsonian's deferred maintenance backl og to increase to $1.76 billion . The increased funding will support hiring additional building maintenance personnel as well as facilities asset management professionals to improve the overall facilities management program. This will help the Institution optimally schedule and perform pre ventive maintenance of facilities and systems. It will also enable the improved identification, prioritization, programming, and execution of facilities repair project s to address the most significant deferred maintenance requirements in the most cost -effective manner. As a result, facilities conditions will gradually improve to better support the mission and reputation of the Institution. Specifically, the increased funding and improved facilities maintenance program will help ensure that proper environme ntal conditions are maintained for the national collections and the visitor experience. These essential funds will enable the Institution to complete additional repairs on life -safety systems; elevators and escalators; heating, ventilation, and air systems; plumbing infrastructure; roofing systems; and exterior hardscapes. It will also allow the Institution to address the need for hazardous material abatement in the Smithsonian's many aging facilities. Several of the Institution's national muse ums have experienced water leaks, sewage system failures, humidity spikes, and other adverse impacts resulting from failing infrastructure. With the funds requested, the Smithsonian will significantly reduce the incidence of such failures and resulting dam ages and preserve not only the collections but the Institution's world -class reputation as the American public expects. 210 FACILITIES OPERATIONS, SECURITY, AND SUPPORT APPLICATION OF OPERATING RESOURCES FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS GENERAL TRUST DONOR/SPONSOR DESIGNATED GOV'T 336 0 0 FY 20 23 ENACTED 1,192 258,332 19 6,789 2 305 0 0 FY 20 24 REQUEST 1,202 278,374 19 7,123 2 320 0 0 Federal Resource Summary by Performance Objective and Program Category FTEs $000 FTEs $000 FTEs $000 Facilities Operations and Maintenance Improve facilities operations and provide a safe and healthy environment547 163,162 555 175,775 8 12,613 Security Provide world-class protection for Smithsonian facilities, collections, staff, visitors and volunteers 645 95,170 647 102,599 2 7,429 Total 1,192 Category FY 2023 FY 2024 Change BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT The Facilities Operations, Security, and Support program operates, secures, and supports the Institution's physical infrastructure in partnership with Smithsonian museums, research centers , and offices . It provides facilities services, operational security , and support services for approximately 1 4 million square feet of owned and leased facilities, in cluding 21 museums , nine research centers, three cultural centers , and the National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute . This program also stewards 180 acr es of garden galleries which are free and open to the public 24 hours a day , and a greenhouse facility showcasing almost 28,000 living collection items . This funding is required to provide a safe, secure, clean, healthy , and welcoming environment for Smithsonian staff and about 25 million on-site visitors each year. Resources within the Facilities Operations, Security, and Support program enable facilities operations, including security services; custodial work; fire protection; building system operations; grounds care and landscaping; garden exhibits care; snow removal; pest control; refuse collection and disposal; vehicle fleet operations and maintenance; and safety, environmental, and health services. The program also supports facilities planning, architectural and 211 engineering design, and real -estate services, as well as postage, utilities, and central rent costs. MEANS AND STRATEGY The Facilities Operations, Security, and Support program will focus its resources on meeting the growing operational requirements of the Institution's property and other programs . The Smithsonian will continue to effectively use its resources to operate and secure facilities and grounds , and to provide safe, healthy , clean, and appealing spaces to meet program needs and public expectations. To accomplish these goals, t he Smithsonian will further benchmark the Institution's custodial staffing and service levels with other museums and profession al organizations, which include meeting standards commonly applied to educational and federal facilities. The Smithsonian's Facilities Management organization will refine work schedules and practices to improve efficiencies and outcomes to the be st extent practicable with available resources and staffing . The program will assess and apply contract support where clear advantages can be achieved. In addition, supervisors will increase their use of information technology to better manage cleaning tasks, report ing requirements, and otherwise improv ing efficiencies and outcomes. Besides providing an acceptable level of facilities care, the Smithsonian i s equally committed to maintaining the highest levels of security to protect staff and visitors and safeguard the national collections . In support of that goa l, the Institution is continuing risk management and strategic security staffing analys es to determine exactly how many security and law -enforcement personnel are needed at each of the Smithsonian 's major facilities. The ongoing analyses address pay levels, training/skill requirements, armed versus unarmed coverage, and the appropriate mix of Smithsonian officers versus contract security guards . Finally, the Smithsonian will continue its commitment to ensure that employees have a safe and healthy workplace by embrac ing a goal of zero injuries; providing professional services to promote a culture of health and wellness; and keeping all Smithsonian facilities in compliance with local building codes, environmental r egulations , and best management practices. EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The FY 2024 budget request includes an increase of $20,042,000 that provides $6,270,000 for necessary pay and other related salary c osts for existing staff funded under this line item ; a programmatic increase of 10 FTEs and $8,600,000 for security, operations, electric vehicles, and support requirements ; as well as a net increase of $5,172,000 for utilities and other costs, which are further justified in the Fixed Costs section of this budget submission. 212 Security (+$4,200,000, +2 FTEs) The requested resources will fund essential security needs described below . The Smithsonian has the solemn obligation and responsibility to provide security for our museums, staff, and visitors on the National Mall. Our security officers and staff represent the front line of defense, and, with an increase in violent crimes and mass shootings, it is more imperative than ever that we provide ade quate resources to keep our museum visitors and staff safe and the museums open to the public. The results of a benchmarking study of armed security officers with peer agencies in the Washington, DC area indicated the salary structure for the Smithsonian' s armed security officers was below those of other agencies. To be competitive, the salary level of armed officers would be increased in FY 2024 to avoid attrition of those officers to other agencies. As the physical footprint of Smithsonian increases and facilities are revitalized, the Institution's security and law-enforcement needs have also grown. This has created a vital need to enhance police and security response training, along with staff awareness and active shooter training. Additio nal staffing is requested to enhance security around the Smithsonian's employee onboarding process in support for the Personnel Security and Identification Office (PSIO). This will ensure that all persons appointed to positions are and remain suitable for employment with the Institution. Furthermore, Smithsonian management has identified a n essential need to improve access control to our buildings and secure areas, emergency response, and accountability of our staff to mitigate the increased climate of physical threats, especially insider threats, as well as to raise the wages for armed security officers to decrease attrition of the more experienced and qualified officers to other agencies. In summary, the requested funding will allow the Institution to continue enhancing security screening at all Smithsonian facilities, equipping our officers, and upgrading our security systems for the protection of staff and visitors. Facilities Operations an d Support (+$4,400,000 , +8 FTEs) Operating under a \"new normal\" in the post -pandemic era, as well as recent inflationary pressures, requires additional resources to keep the Smithsonian's staff, volunteers, and visitors safe. This request provides funding to cover inflationary cost increa ses for contracts, supplies, and materials, to cover additional cleaning demands, as well as to fill vacant positions that have become unaffordable because of increased operating costs. 213 Funding for facilities operations has not kept pace with increased co sts in the past decade. Consequently, the Smithsonian no longer has sufficient resources to maintain an acceptable standard of cleanliness throughout public spaces, which is adversely impacting the visitor experience, staff satisfaction, and the reputation of the Institution, as well as the nation the Smithsonian represents. As recent inflationary pressures have worsened , they have resulted in increased costs for contracts, supplies, and materials. Despite efforts to improve efficiencies and outcomes, addit ional resources are required to achieve acceptable standards of service and cleanliness. In addition, the revitalization of spaces, including the National Air and Space Museum, with modern and higher gloss finishes and exhibits, which get more traffic and require greater time and effort for cleaning, has created more cleaning demands as has the increased need to keep public areas better sanitized in accordance with post -pandemic protocols. The requested funds will also absorb the costs of National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute (NZCBI) cleaning, snow removal, and trash and recycle operations that were once covered by the Friends of the National Zoo (FONZ), which dissolved its relationship with the NZCBI. The Smithsonian's goal is to achieve Association of Physical Plant Administrators (APPA) cleanliness Level 2, Ordinary Tidiness. Currently, the Smithsonian does not have sufficient resources to maintain the lower APPA Level 3 Casual Tidiness standard, which is resulting in a lack of cleanliness and sanitation in our museums. The funds r equested will allow the Smithsonian to maintain the APPA Level 3 standard and get closer to our goal of achieving APPA Level 2. This requested funding also continues efforts to increase the number of zero-emission vehicles to the Smithsonian's fleet. The Smithsonian continues prioritizing the procurement of electric vehicles (including plug -in hybrid technology) and associated charging infrastructure, transitioning the Institution's motor ve hicle fleet to clean and zero -emission vehicles. The request will also provide the resources needed to hire a health and safety training program administrator and additional contract support to address existing gaps in the Smithsonian safety and health training programs. Deficiencies have been documented in Minimum Essential Training Requirements (METRs) during the last several years, which will require additional resources to address, particularly for critical t raining in areas such as fall protection, permit -confined spaces, construction safety, control of hazardous energy, powered industrial trucks, and other equipment operation . The contract support will supplement existing staff and in -house expertise , enhanc ing the Institution -wide safety and health program by support ing internal Smithsonian customers in numerous areas, including: safety plan reviews, construction oversight, safety training program administration, and safety training content development and d elivery (instructor -led and online ). 214 Finally, t he requested fund ing will be used to develop emergency plans and training exercises to enhance the Institution's security posture related to hazards such as active shooters, extreme weather events, and natural/manmade and technological hazards. The Office of Emergency Managem ent (OEM) has a small staff and requires dedicated contractor support to conduct additional emergency exercises and train staff at a faster pace. Furthermore, with the creation of new, comprehensive Smithsonian Emergency Operations Procedures (EOP), additi onal funding will be needed to provide planning, training, and support training exercises in a timely manner as the EOP is implemented at and customized for the needs of each museum, research center, and the National Zoo. The additional funding will also s upport the disseminati on of the new procedures throughout the Smithsonian. 215 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 216 TAB 3 FACILITIES CAPITAL FACILITIES CAPITAL FY 202 2 Enacted $210,000,000 FY 20 23 Enacted $251,645,000 FY 2024 Request $265,000,000 BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT The Facilities Capital Program support s the Smithsonian's mission and represents an investment in the long-term interest of the nation . It provides modern facilities, often within our country's national historic and culturally iconic buildings, to satisfy public programming needs, facilitate world -renowned research efforts, and house the priceless national collections. While f unding for the routine maintenance and minor repairs of facilities is included in the Institution's Salaries and Expenses request , the Facilities Capital Program 's revitalization projects support major repairs or replace declining or failed infrastructure to address the problems of advanced deterioration. Once completed, these projects mitigate the failures in building systems which can create potentially hazardous conditions for visitors and staff, harm animals, damage co llections, or cause the loss of precious scientific data. The Institution uses the National Research Council's (NRC) facility condition assessments to calculate a Facilities Condition Index (FCI) rating. The FC I is the industry standard for analyzing the condition of a facility or group of facilities that may vary in terms of age, design, construction methods, and materials. The FCI is calculated by dividing the sum of the deferred maintenance (based on the asses sed condition ratings) of eight building systems (roofs, electrical, plumbing, HVAC [or heating, ventilation, and air -conditioning] , conveyance \u2014 i.e., elevators and escalators \u2014 interior, exterior, and structure) by the Current Replacement Value (CRV) of the facilities. The estimated overall CRV for the Smithsonian's facilities is $10.37 billion . Coupled with growing inflationary factors, the deteriorating facilities conditions have caused Smithsonian's deferred maintenance backlog to increase to an estimated $1.76 billion. This results in an estimated FCI of 83.1 percent, which the NRC would qua lify as \"fair\" condition. While facilities await renewal, their condition continues to decline, resulting in adverse impacts to Smithsonian operations, collections, and visitor experiences . Additional Facilities Capital funding is critical to realizing th e intended design life and full economic value of Smithsonian facilities and to protecting the Institution's investment in revitalizing its physical infrastructure. 217 EXPLANATION OF CHANGE The Smithsonian requests $ 265,000,000 and 53 FTEs for the Facilities Capital Program in FY 2024 to improve the FCI of many essential facilities and preserve and enhance our national treasures and cultural properties for generations to come . The requested funds will enable the Institution to continue the major revitalization project at the Smithsonian Institution Building (the \"Castle \"), as well as continu e construction of the Museum Support Center's (MSC) Pod 6 Collections Storage Module developed under a special partnership between the Smithsonian and the National Gallery of Art. In addition, other projects include : continuing safety and fire -prevention work at the National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute ; renovating the loading dock at the National Air and Space Museum ; continuing m ultiple projects at the National Museum of Natural History , including restor ation of the building's exterior envelope and upgrad es to the fire -alarm panels and mass -notification system ; continuing m ultiple projects at the National Museum of American History , including replac ement of old air -handling units and renewal of the East Wing; revitalizing t he garden and connecting tunnel at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden; continuing m ultiple renovation projects at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; replacing old air-handling unit s and continuing the decontamination collections project at the Suitland Collections Center ; ongoing s afety and security projects at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; repairing the stormwater system to prevent water leaks at the Donald W. Reynolds Center for American Art and Portraiture ; mitigating a glass blast hazard at the Freer Gallery of Art ; addressing other safety and security hazards as well as collections housing risks throughout the Institutio n; and planning and design for the t wo new congressionally mandated museums : the National Museum of the American Latino and the Smithsonian American Women's History Museum.

PROJECT BACKGROUND: The SIB, often referred to as the \"Castle,\" is the Institution's first home and its symbolic heart. The Arts and Industries Building (AIB) opened in 1881 as the first home of the National Museum. Together, these two buildings make up the Smithsonian's Historic Core. The Castle has historic architectural and institutional significance and is the public's doorway to, and the symbol of, the Smithsonian Institution. Both buildings are listed by the Department of the Interior as National Historic Landmarks. Plans for r evitalization of the AIB have been put on hold pending a decision whether to use the building as the home of a new museum . PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The Castle needs major revitalization work that will include new heating, air - conditioning, ventilation, electrical, and plumbing systems, as well as telecommunications, security, and life -safety systems. A major goal of the revitalization will be to provi de efficient and accessible space for visitors and staff. Public spaces will be restored after years of piecemeal remodeling that has diminished their original proportions and appearance. The last comprehensive refurbishment of the Castle occurred more tha n 50 years ago. PROJECT DESCRIPTION : The Budget provides $65.0 million in FY 2024 to award the construction management contract for foundation work that include s excavation below the building, underpinning the existing foundations, and installing a seismic base isolation system at the Castle to protect against future earthquake activity . Future work will include replacing or restoring all the building 's elements and systems, including mechanical, electrical, pl umbing, life -safety, security, telephone, and data systems , as well as refurbishing the Castle's windows, roof, and exterior stonework. The building 's life -safety and infrastructure systems will be updated for code compliance . Blast and seismic vulnerabili ty issues will be augmented . A newly expanded loading dock will improve the efficiency and safety of materials handling. 223 PROGRESS TO DATE: Programming was completed in FY s 2019 and 2020. Design was initiated in FY 2020 . The concept design was submitted in FY 2021 and the schematic design was completed in FY 2022 . Design work will continue through FY 2023. Early construction activities were initiated in FY s 2022 and 2023. IMPACT OF DELAY: If this project does not move forward, construction on the project will stop and the Castle will remain at increasing risk of catastrophic electrical, mechanical, and plumbing systems failure s, which would require permane ntly relocating all staff from the building and closing the facility to visitors. It is essential to continue construction to ensure that construction activity visible by the public is completed before the semi -quincentennial celebrations on the National M all in FY 2026. 224 PROJECT TITLE: Renovate Cheetah Conservation Station (CCS) INSTALLATION: National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute (NZCBI) LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $4,000* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING : $9,700* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING : $5,000* Total $18,700* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design . PROJECT BACKGROUND : Since 1891, various architects, including Olmsted Associates, created the National Zoo as we know it today. In contrast to earlier zoos which focused on displaying caged animals to the public, the Zoo in Rock Creek Park was formed for the care and conservation of endangered species in a more naturalistic habitat. For this purpose, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted (of New York City's Central Park fame) was chosen to plan a system of paths winding gently through the steeply slop ed, verdant park. Fellow Boston architect William Ralph Emerson designed a few of the early animal houses, such as the Buffalo Barn and the first Lion House. These buildings, made of rustic, local stone or wood, reflect the natural features of Rock Creek P ark and were meant to evoke images of the American wilderness. The National Zoo's 2008 Comprehensive Facilities Master Plan (CFMP) calls for a series of major capital renewal projects to be executed in order of priority during the next six to 11 years the plan is in effect. Much progress has been made with renewing the failing buildings, but there are several facilities which remain a priority for renewal, including the Cheetah Conservation Station. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: Much of the CCS area has old and failing infrastructure. The site's failing stormwater and sanitary utilities are negatively impacting animal welfare, with standing water and sanitary water backups. Over time, these conditions have damaged adjacent systems and structures, requiring a full building and site revit alization, including replacement of sidewalks and shelters. The mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems can no longer be repaired, and their dilapidated condition is causing significant issues with plumbing backups and insufficient heating, cooling, a nd humidification. In addition, the public and staff areas are deteriorating, causing unsafe working conditions. The animal habitats and housing are also inadequate, causing animal welfare and safety concerns and not allowing for appropriate behaviors and reproduction of the living collection. In many areas, erosion has caused tripping hazards and unsafe working conditions. This work is necessary to keep the facilities code -compliant with the constantly evolving animal care standards required to maintain ac creditation by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) and by the United States' Department of Agriculture (USDA). 225 PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $4.0 million in FY 2024 to continue renovating the CCS to include mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) system upgrades, along with related building infrastructure improvements, stormwater management and yard renovations, added containment fencing, and pedestrian surface repairs. As part of this project , nearly all site and building infra structure will be revitalized, which will restore operational functionality and support animal care needs. In addition, due to erosion caused by intense storm run -off, the structural foundation for the station must be replaced and raised up to prevent futu re deterioration. The containment fence, visitor barriers, and security systems will be replaced in response to AZA inspections and recommendations, and to reduce the deferred maintenance backlog. Structural improvements will be made to address the safety of maintenance workers and support best practices in animal welfare and management of their habitats and housing. PROGRESS TO DATE: The initial design report was completed in November of 2021. Work on the full design package has begun , with the 100 perce nt design submittal expected in the third quarter of FY 2023. IMPACT OF DELAY: A delay in renovating the CCS could threaten the National Zoo's AZA accreditation and damage the Institution's reputation and mission. System failures will result in unnecess ary operational emergency responses which are costly, disruptive, and preventable. Conditions for animal welfare and safety in yards are currently unacceptable and, if left at current standards , the CCS will have to be shut down. The impact of design delays would prevent the project from staying coordinated with the animal moves and negatively affect the guest experience. 226 PROJECT TITLE: Provide Accessible Walkway at Great Flight Aviary INSTALLATION: National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute (NZCBI) LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $2,000* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING: $3,000* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $5,000* PROJECT BACKGROUND : Since 1891, various architects, including Olmsted Associates, created the National Zoo as we know it today. In contrast to earlier zoos which focused on displaying caged animals to the public, the Zoo in Rock Creek Park was formed for the care and conserva tion of endangered species in a more naturalistic habitat. For this purpose, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted (of New York City's Central Park fame) was chosen to plan a system of paths winding gently through the steeply sloped, verdant park. Fellow Boston architect William Ralph Emerson designed a few of the early animal houses, such as the Buffalo Barn and the first Lion House. These buildings, made of rustic, local stone or wood, reflect the natural features of Rock Creek Park and were meant to evoke images of the American wilderness. The Great Flight Aviary project was completed in the 1960s and consists of six parabolic steel arches that formed a circle approximately 130 feet in diameter , with a central mast height of nearly 90 feet . PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: As constructed in the 1960s, a concrete bridge connects the Bird House and the Great Flight Aviary (GFA) above ground level. Egress to grade is only available using a staircase. Modifying access to the bridge is requ ired for compliance with current Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines. The natural flow of the exhibit directs visitors to the GFA bridge. However, currently, the GFA bridge has no universally accessible walkway for guests with disabilities and people with strollers. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $2.0 million in FY 2024 to begin the project for an accessible, ADA -compliant egress from the walkway connecting the GFA and the Bird House exhibit. PROGRESS TO DATE: Contract award for preliminary design is expected in the third quarter of FY 2023. IMPACT OF DELAY: Delaying this project pushes back the Zoo's ability to meet code -complian ce and ADA regulations that require a safe, accessible means of travel for all patrons of this facility. 227 PROJECT TITLE: Repair Site -Wide Electrical Distribution INSTALLATION: National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute (NZCBI) LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $2,000* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $2,000* PROJECT BACKGROUND : Since 1891, various architects, including Olmsted Associates, created the National Zoo as we know it today. In contrast to earlier zoos which focused on displaying caged animals to the public, the Zoo in Rock Creek Park was formed for the care and conservation of endangered species in a more naturalistic habitat.

Fellow Boston architect William Ralph Emerson designed a few of the early animal houses, su ch as the Buffalo Barn and the first Lion House. These buildings, made of rustic, local stone or wood, reflect the natural features of Rock Creek Park and were meant to evoke images of the American wilderness. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The Zoo has undergon e modest growth in recent years that has resulted in a few changes and modifications to the campus electrical distribution system. The facilities have significant limitations in power capacity for the 15kV distribution system , specifically with the \"Red\" and \"Blue\" feeders. In addition, the Zoo has campus -wide lack of power capacity issues. This project will support the power requirements for upcoming projects planned at various locations throughout the Rock Creek campus. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $2.0 million in FY 2024 to begin the process of repairing the site's electrical distribution systems. A few of the electrical components of the building distribution system have been updated, such as the switchgear s, but many of th e building distribution components still need replacing and are at the end of their expected service life. Replacement components are very scarce, and refurbished components are hard to find and expensive, creating a major problem with keeping the system i n operation . PROGRESS TO DATE: The design contract award is anticipated in the fourth quarter of FY 2023. Currently, electrical meters are being installed at the Vet erinary Hospital so th at peak loads can be identified prior to designing new equipment IMPACT OF DELAY: Delaying this project could result in areas of the Zoo being closed permanently to conserve power for other areas. If an external event due to weather or unseasonably warm conditions were to occur, the Zoo would have to close to the public to provide the proper safety to visitors, living collections , and infrastructure. 228 PROJECT TITLE: Upgrade Chiller C apacity at Seal and Sea Lion Exhibit INSTALLATION: National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute (NZCBI) LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $2,000* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $2,000* PROJECT BACKGROUND : Since 1891, various architects, including Olmsted Associates, created the National Zoo as we know it today. In contrast to earlier zoos which focused on displaying caged animals to the public, the Zoo in Rock Creek Park was formed for the care and conservation of endangered species in a more naturalistic habitat. For this purpose, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted (of New York City's Central Park fame) was chosen to plan a system of paths winding gently through the steeply sloped, verdant park. Fellow Boston architect William Ralph Emerson designed a few of the early animal houses, su ch as the Buffalo Barn and the first Lion House. These buildings, made of rustic, local stone or wood, reflect the natural features of Rock Creek Park and were meant to evoke images of the American wilderness. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The two Trane chiller s that make up the Life Support System (LSS) were installed in 2003 , are at the end of their life expectancy , and require replacement. The chillers have difficulty meeting the water temperature requirements and do not provide the redundancy required. The L SS chiller system serves four pools: the gray seal exhibit, gray seal holding area, the sea lion exhibit, and the sea lion holding area. This equipment is essential to meet animal welfare requirements set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) , which specify that water temperatures for marine mammals must be maintained at or below 72 degrees Fahrenheit. The Zoo has no alternative location to place the marine mammals in the event of a chiller failu re. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $2.0 million in FY 2024 to replace the existing chillers. In addition, the existing emergency generator does not have the capacity to support the existing chiller system and must be replaced. PROGRESS TO DATE: Preliminary design assessment is complete , with the final design submission expected during the fourth quarter of FY 2023. Construction award is anticipated for the second quarter of FY 2024. IMPACT OF DELAY: Delaying the chiller replacement places the seal s and sea lions at risk and puts the Zoo at risk of losing AZA accreditation for failing to meet the temperature requirements needed to maintain these living collections if the existing chillers were to fail. 229 PROJECT TIT LE: Modify Security Fence and Accessibility \u2014 Phase 3 (Bus Lot) INSTALLATION: National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute (NZCBI) LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $2,000* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design Total $2,000* PROJECT BACKGROUND : Since 1891, various architects, including Olmsted Associates, created the National Zoo as we know it today.

These buildings, made of rustic, local stone or wood, reflect the natural features of Rock Creek Park and were meant to evoke images of the American wilderness. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: Access for visitors arriving by private vehicle s is unsafe, confusing, and has security vulnerabilities. Currently, visitors are provided with no visual clues on how to maneuver from their parked vehicles into the main Zoo campus. A permanent structure is need ed to house staf f to minimize security risks and safely manage the screening process by funneling visitors to entry points where they can be screened. Also, a new middle -access point will have to be built for a connection to a raised asphalt crosswalk that complies with t he Americans with Disabilities Act and is painted with standard crosswalk markings and leads to a new path into the main walkway. Additional security elements, new ornamental fencing, and gates are also required. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian re quests $2.0 million in FY 2024 to modernize security and improve pedestrian access to the National Zoo. This project will improve ticketing , visitor flow, wayfinding signage, screening options, visitor counting, and video surveillance, enhance information technology ( IT) infrastructure, and create a search and recovery space, as well as build a new weather -controlled structure for staff and access for Zoo maintenance security carts. PROGRESS TO DATE: The Statement of Work for design is complete and the design contract award is anticipated to occur by the fourth quarter of FY 2023. IMPACT OF DELAY: Delaying the project would hamper the Zoo's ability to provide safe, efficient, and reliable access f or visitors and staff who manage large crowds every day . 230 PROJECT TITLE: Revitalize Steam Tunnels and Piping INSTALLATION: National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute (NZCBI) LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $2,000* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING: $6,000* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $8,000* PROJECT BACKGROUND : Since 1891, various architects, including Olmsted Associates, created the National Zoo as we know it today. In contrast to earlier zoos which focused on displaying caged animals to the public, the Zoo in Rock Creek Park was formed for the care and conservation of endangered species in a more naturalistic habitat. For this purpose, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted (of New York City's Central Park fame) was chosen to plan a system of paths winding gently through the steeply sloped, verdant park. Fellow Boston architect William Ralph Emerson designed a few of the early animal houses, such as the Buffalo Barn and the first Lion House. These buildings, made of rustic, local stone, or wood, reflect the natural features of Rock Creek Park and were meant to evoke images of the American wilderness. The st eam tunnel system serves the following \"Middle Zoo \" facilities: the Think Tank, Reptile Discovery Center, Lemur exhibit, Great Ape House, Small Mammal exhibit , Wallaby exhibit, and Elephant House, as well as parts of the Lower Zoo . PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The National Zoo is served by a central Boiler Plant that pipes steam throughout the campus on two separate , direct , buried distribution lines. The original steam tunnel distribution system was constructed in the 1920s and is now past its useful service life. The system is failing and requires constant replacing of segments and components to keep it functioning. Various segments have failed completely and sprung leaks due to settlement cracks, connection point failures, and corrosion which has resulted in inadequate heat supply for animals that cannot tolerate the cold during winter. The system requires constant maintenance and extensive and constant patching of leaks and other emergency temporary repairs to keep it functioning , which adds to the Zoo's ope rating expenses . PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $2.0 million in FY 2024 to revitalize/replace the steam distribution systems at the National Zoo . The steam distribution serves 12 buildings throughout the campus. This project replaces the steam supply to the Propagation Building. Replacement requires the open excavation and removal of failed concrete supply lines and replacement with modern materia ls. This project will also mitigate HAZMAT -containing materials used in the original construction. 231 PROGRESS TO DATE: Design for the next phase of work is complete. The construction contract for the steam tunnel revitalization is anticipated to be awarded in the first quarter of FY 2024. Design scope and contracting for subsequent phases of work will be developed in FY 2024. IMPACT OF DELAY: A delay in completing the upgrades to the steam distribution system could cause serious harm to staff and living collections as well as the need for emergency responses which are costly, disruptive, and preventable. 232 PROJECT TITLE: Upgrade Seal and Sea Lion Shade Structures INSTALLATION: National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute (NZCBI) LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $600* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING : $600* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design .

Fell ow Boston architect William Ralph Emerson designed a few of the early animal houses, such as the Buffalo Barn and the first Lion House. These buildings, made of rustic, local stone or wood, reflect the natural features of Rock Creek Park and were meant to evoke images of the American wilderness. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: Eye problems have been a n issue with seals and sea lions at zoological parks across the country, including at the National Zoo . Animal health experts suspect a contributing factor is ultravi olet (UV) light from direct sunlight and that a simple remedy is to provide shady spots for the animals. Expanding the shade panel system at the Zoo is the next phase in improving animal habitat and yards throughout the facility. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $600,000 in FY 202 4 to continue upgrad ing the shade structures in the habitat to protect the animals from excessive solar glare that is causing harm to the seals and sea lions. PROGRESS TO DATE: The design contract award is anticipated for the first quarter of FY 2024. The shade structure mock -ups were constructed in FY 2021 as a proof of concept for addressing the FY 2020 Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) recommendations before continuing with the project. Th is phase will complete compliance with the AZA requirements . IMPACT OF DELAY: Delaying these improvements and repairs could harm the animals as well as threaten AZA accreditation and result in the need for emergency responses which are costly, disruptive, and preventable. 233 PROJECT TITLE: Upgrade Electronic Security at the Veterinary Hospital INSTALLATION: National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute ( NZCBI ) LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $500* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design.

The SCBI was originally an army remount station. Construction began in 1911 and by 1916 the complex contained officers' quarters, barns, and stables on vast acreage. Primarily used to breed horses for use by the U.S. Army, the complex was active during World War II as a prisoner -of-war camp for ca ptured German soldiers. Many of the original structures still stand and have been repurposed to support the research in rare and endangered animals. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: To comply with Occupational and Safety Administration standards, the SCBI requires the installation of interior and exterior anchor fall -protection systems at various buildings within the campus. Fall -protection systems are required for maintenance and repair operations on building exterior surfaces and in building interior s. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $1.1 million in FY 2024 for the installation of fall - protection devices at various buildings at the SCBI to allow for safe access on maintenance projects campus -wide. Phase 1 will focus on the Vet erinary Hospital. PROGRESS TO DATE: Design work started in FY 2021 and will be completed in the fourth quarter of FY 2023, with construction completed in FY 2024. IMPACT OF DELAY: Delaying the installation of fall -protection anchors prevents timely maintenance at locations that are out of normal reach , resulting in potential equipment failure. Failure to maintain equipment could result in the need for emergency repairs, which are costly, disruptive, and preventable. 235 PROJECT TITLE: Upgrade Fire Protection INSTALLATION: National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute ( NZCBI ) LOCATION: Front Royal, Virginia FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $1,000* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design.

The SCBI was originally an army remount station. Construction began in 1911 and by 1916 the complex contained officers' quarters, barns, and stables on vast acreage. Primarily used to breed horses for use by the U.S. Army, the complex was active during World War II as a prisoner -of-war camp for captured German soldiers. Many of the original struc tures still stand and have been repurposed to support the research in rare and endangered animals. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: Several SCBI buildings do not have adequate fire protection that meets current safety code s. Complete sprinkler coverage throughout buildings is essential for controlling fires early before they can overtax the sprinkler system. According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA ) guidance that sets the standards for the installation of sprinkler systems, building sprinkler systems must extend to the entire building and be upgraded as necessary to provide complete coverage. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $1.0 million in FY 2024 to upgrade fire protection for offices and support areas. This project is part of a n SCBI -wide initiative to bring older buildings into compliance with new codes and standards. Phase 1 will upgrade sprinkler systems at the Vet erinary Hospital. PROGRESS TO DATE: Design work began in FY 2022 and will be completed in the fourth quarter of FY 2023, with the construction expected to be complete in FY 2024. IMPACT OF DELAY: Delaying fire -protection upgrades at SCBI risks the loss of life and/or property due to fire s and having an inadequate sy stem to contain them . 236 PROJECT TITLE: Renew Veterinary Hospital INSTALLATION: National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute (NZCBI) LOCATION: Front Royal, Virginia FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $4,100* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING: $3,100* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING : $5,000 * * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design .

This facility houses between 30 to 40 endangered species at any given time, and includes a Geographic Information System (GIS), endocrine and gamete lab s, veterinary clinic, radio tracking lab, 14 field stations, and biodiversity monitoring plots, as well as a conference center, dormitories, and education offices. The SCBI was originally an army remount station. Construction began in 1911 and by 1916 the complex contained officers' quarters, barns, and stables on vast acreage. Primarily used to breed horses for use by the U.S. Army, the complex was active during World War II as a prisoner -of-war camp for captured German soldiers. Many of the original struc tures still stand and have been repurposed to accommodate the research in rare and endangered animals. The Veterinary Hospital supports research and care for various species of zebras, onagers, Przewalski's horses, maned wolves, cheetahs, red pandas, and c louded leopards. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The Veterinary Hospital has not been renovated since it was constructed in 1985 and lacks adequate fire protection, compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements, and modern electrical and mechanical distribution systems. The rehabilitation of the Veterinary Hospital at the SCBI is an integral part of the 2008 Front Royal Comprehensive Facilities Master Plan a nd will provide optimal operation of laboratory space, operating theaters, office space, animal quarantine area(s), and the pharmacy. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $4.1 million in FY 2024 for the rehabilitation of the 13,250 -square -foot Veterinary Hospital at the SCBI to support a modern facility that will allow state -of-the-art veterinary care for the animals. This project creates an exterior fenced animal enclosure to facilitate observation of the animals after being treated. In additio n, the existing ambulance discharge area will be covered to protect animal care staff from snow and rain , which is needed when they must maneuver large , hooved animals from the transportation unit into the facility. 237 PROGRESS TO DATE: Design work bega n in the fourth quarter of FY 2022 and will be completed in phases. Phase 1 design for the endocrine relocation will be complete in the third quarter of FY 2023. Phase 2 design is for the temporary surgical space and may be included in the construction contract for phase 1. Final design for the renewal will be completed for construction planned t o start in FY 2024. IMPACT OF DELAY: Delaying the renewal and rehabilitation of the Veterinary Hospital at the SCBI could result in lack of proper care to the animals, along with the loss of vital scientific research essential to the survival of rare an d endangered species, as well as the potential emergency situations that could harm the animals in the care of the Smithsonian. Such emergency situations would incur additional, preventable, and unnecessary higher costs. 238 PROJECT TITLE: Improve Living Collections Habitat Infrastructure INSTALLATION: National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute ( NZCBI ) LOCATION: Front Royal, Virginia FY 2024 COST (Thousands of Dollars): $2,000* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING : $1,200* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING: $2,400* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design . Total $5,600* PROJECT BACKGROUND : The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) is a 3,200 -acre facility located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Front Royal, Virginia. This facility houses between 30 and 40 endangered species at any given time and includes a Geographic Information System (GIS), endocrine and gamete lab s, veterinary clinic, radio tracking lab, 14 field stations, and biodiversity monitoring plots, as well as a conference center, dormitories, and education offices. The SCBI was originally an army remount station. Construction began in 1911 and by 1916 the complex contained officers' quarters, barns, stables, and a racetrack on vast acreage. Primarily used to breed horses for use by the U.S. Army, the complex was quite active during World War II as a prisoner -of-war camp for captured German soldiers. Many of the original structures still stand and have been repurposed to support the research of animal life. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The Improve Living Collections Infrastructure Program is a multi -year, phased implementation of relatively small projects that hav e been identified, ranked, and prioritized to support the requirements of park management, animal care, and science staff. Dozens of deficiencies will be corrected by this project. This project is required to resolve an Association of Zoos and Aquariums ( AZA) accreditation inspection that discovered deficiencies and animal life and safety concerns. Remediation work will fix weather -related deficiencies for various animal holding buildings that require removal of hazardous materials and demolition of failin g structures to mitigate unsafe conditions for both staff and animals. This includes animal pools and containment fences, which keep out wild predators such as bears, coyotes, and foxes. Required improvements to the animal -containment facilities include ta ller fences, hot wires, and electrical infrastructure, as well as dig barriers, animal -shift gates, human -access safety gates, and climbing structures for animal exercise. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $2. 0 million in FY 2024 to upgrade various systems which do not meet current codes and standards for animal holding , as well as to protect the structures from further deterioration. The project will renew utilities, roads, and containment fencing ; provide access to fresh water; and install proper sanitary waste drainage and stormwater management systems. Environmentally sustainable designs will 239 create natural protection systems that vastly improve the welfare of living collections placed in the NZCBI's care. In addition, w ork will include improvements to animal habitats and yards; refurbishment of perimeter and interior separation/containment fences and barriers; human/animal safety separation barriers, which include shift gates, chutes, ladders, and dig barriers; predation and invasive species exclusion systems; replacement of pools/water systems ; and quality improvements and controls required for the humane and responsible stewardship of captive and endangered animals. PROGRESS TO DATE: The project is in the planning and design phase, with a construction award planned for FY 2024. IMPACT OF DELAY: Delaying these improvements and repairs could threaten the Institute's AZA accreditation, leave highly endangered species vulnerable to wild animal predation and escape, as well as cause harm to visitors, staff, and animals. In addition, failure to upgrade the living collections infrastructure could result in the need for em ergency repairs, which are costly, disruptive, and preventable. 240 PROJECT TITLE: Upgrade Post Area Utilities INSTALLATION: National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute ( NZCBI ) LOCATION: Front Royal, Virginia FY 2024 COST (Thousands of Dollars): $2,000* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING : $4,800* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design . Total $6,800* PROJECT BACKGROUND : The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) is a 3,200 -acre facility located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Front Royal, Virginia. This facility houses between 30 and 40 endangered species at any given time, and includes a Geographic Information System (GIS), endocrine and gamete labs, veterinary clinic, radio tracking lab, 14 field stations, and biodiversity monitoring plots, as well as a conference center, dormitories, and education offices. The SCBI was originally an army remount station. Construction began in 1911 and by 1916 the complex contained officers' quarters, barns, stables, and a racetrack on vast acreage. Primarily used to breed horses for use by the U.S. Army, the complex was quite active during World War II as a prisone r-of-war camp for captured German soldiers. Many of the original structures still stand and have been repurposed to support the research of animal life. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The SCBI prepared a comprehensive utilities master plan in 2008 to serve as th e basis for designing an upgraded utility infrastructure to support the entire campus for water, sewer, electric, and telecommunications systems and storm drains. The existing electrical, sewer, water supply, and telecommunications distribution systems hav e reached the end of their useful service lives. The utility infrastructure systems are prone to failure and unreliable service , which include unexpected power loss and mission interruption. The on -site sewer system is made of terra cotta or vitrified clay construction that is between 60 and 100 years old and contributing to recent problems with sewer breaks at various locations on campus. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $2.0 million in FY 2024 to continue utility upgrades that will improve sanitary sewer, electrical, communications, and water utilities along the Long Hill Road and Meade Road portions of the campus . Approximately 3,400 feet of new 4 -or 6-inch lateral and submain sewers and 18 sanitary manholes are required to replace the existing on -site collection system and extend the sewer collection system along the crane yards from the main campus. Based on the age and condition of the existing on -site overhead electric distribution system, and the numerous code -related deficienc ies, most of the system will need to be replaced, including the overhead electric distribution system. Additionally, a new underground electric distribution system will need to be installed. 241 PROGRESS TO DATE: Procurement documents are being prepared for award in FY 2023. The 2008 comprehensive utilities master plan detailed the scope of work for water, sewer, stormwater management, electrical distribution, and telecommunications systems . Concurrently, in April of 2008, the Smithsonian included a zero -energy Zoo study sponsored by the Department of Energy's Energy Management Program. IMPACT OF DELAY: The utility infrastructure systems have reached the end of their useful service life and are prone to systematic failures. Large -scale utility disruption s could occur if this comprehensive overhaul is not completed soon, potentially creating risks for staff and the many animals in their care. 242 PROJECT TITLE: Renovate Loading Dock INSTALLATION: National Air and Space Museum (NASM) \u2014 National Mall Building LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $8,000* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING: $10,000* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $18,000* PROJECT BACKGROUND : The NASM was built in 1976 to commemorate the national development of aviation and space flight. The 747,877 -gross -square -foot building (including approximately 161,145 square feet of exhibit galleries) preserves and displays artifacts, aeronautical and space flight equipment, significant historical data, and related technologies. The exhibit galleries hold the largest collection of historic air and spacecraft in the world. Before the COVID -19 pandemic , the Museum received an average of more than seven million visitors annually. The original loading dock built in 1976 was reconfigured in the 1980s as part of the East End restaurant addition. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The loading dock does not meet current blast, life -safety, and fire -protection codes. In addition, the loading dock and its access ramp provide limited overhead clearance, forcing delivery trucks to unload on the ramp to the basement or park illegally on the street or sidewalk, creating a safety hazard. A revitalization project at the NASM -National Mall Building (NMB) is well under way. The construction effort is occurring in two main phases to allow continual , partial operation of the Museum throughout the project. During the second main phase of the major revitalization project, which started in April of 2022, access to areas in and around the restaurant were closed off to allow for safe construction and reno vation efforts within and around the eastern sections of the Museum. These closures enable the Museum to renovate the loading dock and make code -related updates identified in the 2013 NASM Facilities Master Plan. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $8.0 million in FY 2024 to begin this project. The multi - year project will update life -safety and fi re-protection equipment systems, including the infrastructure to bring the loading dock up to current life -safety and blast requirements. In addition, this project will improve height clearance, where possible , to allow for access by larger trucks, and cre ate separate areas for restaurant deliveries, trash disposal and pick - up, and for movement of Museum collections. This upgrade will also allow for code compliance, greater security, increased safety, and efficiency of Museum operations. 243 PROGRESS TO DATE: A feasibility study report completed in October of 2022 will form the basis of design. The request for proposal f rom Architect/Engineering (A/E) design services was issued in the first quarter of FY 2023, with award of the design contrac t and work on the full design package expected to begin by the third quarter of FY 2023 . Construction is anticipated to start in FY 2024. IMPACT OF DELAY: A delay in renovating the NASM loading dock would increase the risk to its safe and efficient op erations in support of the Museum. Any system failures will result in unnecessary operational emergency responses which are costly, disruptive, and preventable. 244 PROJECT TITLE: Upgrade Floor Barrier -Mounted Exhibit Lighting INSTALLATION: National Air and Space Museum (NASM) Udvar -Hazy Center LOCATION: Chantilly, COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $2,000* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING : $2,000* Total $4,000* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design . PROJECT BACKGROUND : The Udvar -Hazy Center (UHC) in Chantilly, Virginia is the companion facility to the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) on the National Mall in Washington, DC. Opened in 2003, the 760,000 -square -foot building consists of two large hangers \u2014 the Boeing Aviation Hangar and the James S. McDonnell Space Hangar . The facility displays thousands of aviation and space artifacts, in cluding a Lockheed SR -71 Blackbird and the space shuttle Discovery , and before the COVID -19 pandemic received more than 1.5 million visitors annually. When construction was complete in 2003, the facility included exhibit barriers which incorporated exhibit lighting fixtures and track lighting mounted to the barriers. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: In 2014, safety issues required the track lighting system to be removed. The lighting track was short -circuiting, and the barriers were found to be unsecure. In 2017, a study was completed to analyze possible improvements to the barrier -mounted exhibit lighting. The study determined the original track system used at the exhibit barriers was not code - compli ant, was unsafe, and susceptible to wear and tear that ultimately resulted in the short -circuiting. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $2.0 million in FY 2024 to begin upgrading the exhibit barrier -mounted lighting system , bringing it to code -compliance, adding greater security, increasing safety, and providing greater energy efficiency. PROGRESS TO DATE: Design started in October of 2022 and is expected to be complete by the fourth quarter of FY 2023. Construction is anticipated to start some time in FY 2024. IMPACT OF DELAY: Since the previous barrier -mounted exhibit lighting system was removed, the NASM -UHC has been operating with insufficient exhibit illumination. A delay in upgrading the floor barrier -mounted exhibit lighting greatly reduces the quality of the visitor experience, impacts visitation , and impairs the Museum 's mission to \"Commemorate, Educate, [and] Inspire \" both the history of aviation and spaceflight and the public. 245 PROJECT TITLE: Restore Main Building Exterior Envelope, East and West Sides INSTALLATION: National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $2,000* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING : $2,000* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $4,000* PROJECT BACKGROUND: The NMNH building was designed by architects Hornblower and Marshall, with contributions by Charles McKim, and opened to the public in 1910. The East and West Wings were added in the early 1960s. Two infill buildings were constructed in the original building's East and West courtyards in the late 1990s. In addition to its wide array of public exhibits, the 1.3 -million -square -foot-building houses more than 147 million specimens and artifacts in its collections (used by both resident and visiting researchers), and educational, scientific, and administrative facilities serving approximately 1,200 people. The NMNH is one of the most visited museums in the world and typically hosts between seven and eight million visitors annually. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The east and west side s of the main building ha ve experienced leaks throughout the years. For example, during a driving rainstorm in October of 2021, the East Wing of the main building experienced serious leaks , with water intrusion into office spaces and corridors. An internal survey noted deficiencies to the exterior building envelope that allowed for the water intrusion, including cracked and broken stones, missing caulking, and windows that require repairing. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $2.0 million in FY 2024 to begin restoring the building's exterior. The project will repair the damaged granite panels and replace the panels that are beyond repair, as well as repair and tighten windows and fix the ledge on the sixth floor. PROGRESS TO DATE: A contract to survey the extent of the damage and provide project design was awarded in early FY 2022. The design will be completed by the summer of 2023. IMPACT OF DELAY: A delay in repairing the exterior of the east and west side s of the main building will cause continue d damage to t he main building infrastructure, equipment, collections, and artifacts. 246 PROJECT TITLE: Upgrade Fire -Alarm Panels and Mass -Notification Systems INSTALLATION: National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars ): $3,200 * PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING : $18,200* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design . Total $21,400* PROJECT BACKGROUND: The NMNH building was designed by architects Hornblower and Marshall, with contributions by Charles McKim, and opened to the public in 1910. The East and West Wings were added in the early 1960s. Two infill buildings were constructed in the original building's East and West courtyards in the late 199 0s. In addition to its wide array of public exhibits, the 1.3 -million -square -foot-building houses more than 147 million specimens and artifacts in its collections (used by both resident and visiting researchers), and educational, scientific, and administra tive facilities serving approximately 1,200 people. The NMNH is one of the most visited museums in the world and typically hosts between seven and eight million visitors annually. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The current NMNH fire -alarm panels are out of date and became obsolete when their production ended in September of 2018. Over time, parts will become difficult or impossible to find and eventually they will be incompatible with newer equipment. A simultaneous upgrade to the mass -notification system is well -timed because the two systems are integrated. Currently, the NMNH has no comprehensive way to notify the public and staff during emergencies. The speakers installed as part of the fire -alarm upgrade would provide that mass -notification capa bility. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $3.2 million in FY 2024 to continue upgrading the fire - alarm panels and components and installing a new mass -notification system. The Museum's existing Siemens MXL panels must be upgraded to the new Siemens XLS panels, and a comprehens ive mass -notification system needs to be designed and implemented as well. There is economy and efficiency in combining the fire -alarm system upgrade and replacement with the new speaker installation. The speaker layout for the mass -notification system wil l account for the Museum's acoustic issues, which are significant due to the grand and historic nature of the building with its many echoing high ceilings and large galleries. PROGRESS TO DATE: The final feasibility report, completed in March of 2019, provided the basis for the design contract scope, which was awarded in July of 2019, and completed in January of 2022. The initial construction contract was award ed in the fourth quarter of FY 2022 with a continuation of contracting through FY 2024. 247 IMPACT OF DELAY: An aging, outdated life -safety system runs the risk of failure and endangering collections, visitors, and staff. In the worst -case scenario, a malfunctioning fire -alarm system could put lives at risk, as well as delay notification of an active fire, possibly causing severe damage to the Museum and the national collections. In addition, mass -notification systems are rapidly becoming an essential feature in public buildings because they are necessary to quickly broadcast life -saving informa tion in the event of natural or man -made emergencies ranging from severe storms to active shooter incidents . 248 PROJECT TITLE: INSTALLATION: LOCATION: Replace Rotunda Copper Roof National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) Washington, DC FY 202 4 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $1,000 * * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $1,000* PROJECT BACKGROUND: The NMNH building was designed by architects Hornblower and Marshall, with contributions by Charles McKim, and opened to the public in 1910. The East and West Wings were added in the early 1960s. Two infill buildings were constructed in the original buildi ng's East and West courtyards in the late 1990s. In addition to its vast array of public exhibits, the 1.3 -million -square -foot-building houses more than 147 million specimens and artifacts in its collections (used by both resident and visiting researchers) , and educational, scientific, and administrative facilities serving approximately 1,200 people. The NMNH is one of the most visited museums in the world and typically hosts between seven and eight million visitors a year . PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The slat e dome of NMNH's Rotunda is surrounded by large areas of a flat copper roof. This flat -seam copper roof is in very poor condition. It has a lot of broken solder seams which have led to multiple water leaks throughout the Museum, endangering the priceless c ollections and sensitive equipment below. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $1.0 million in FY 2024 to begin remov ing and replac ing the existing copper roof, and existing flashing, and to repair other roof leaks around pipes and drains. Additionally, the project will include removal and repair/replacement of the first three rows of slate on the Rotunda dome to install the new copper and waterproofing sub -layers to continue up under the slate \u2014 a best practice for avoidin g future water infiltration. PROGRESS TO DATE: A feasibility report for the Rotunda copper roof replacement was recently completed and formed the basis for a scope of work and cost estimate for the project, which have also been completed. IMPACT OF DELAY: If the corroded copper roof is not replaced in a timely manner, water leaks will continue to damage the building fabric, sensitive equipment, and collections, as well as pose a danger to staff and the visiting public. 249 PROJECT TITLE: INSTALLATION: LOCATION: Modernize West Court Elevators National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $1,800* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $1,800 * PROJECT BACKGROUND: The NMNH building was designed by architects Hornblower and Marshall, with contributions by Charles McKim, and opened to the public in 1910. The East and West Wings were added in the early 1960s. Two infill buildings were constructed in the original building's East and West courtyards in the late 1990s. In addition to its wide array of public exhibits, the 1.3 -million -square -foot-building houses more than 147 million specimens and artifacts in its collections. The NMNH is one of the most visited museums in the world. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: Elevators 32, 33, 35 , and 36 were installed when the West Court of the Museum was newly constructed in 1996 and are overdue for an upgrade because of their high usage and age. Many of the elevator door operators and controllers require constant maintenance and are always at risk of failure. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $1.8 million in FY 2024 to begin the modernization of four elevators that are more than 2 5 years old. Elevators 32 and 33 provide access to food service areas and therefore have had high usage since their installation. The door operators, controllers, and other door components have developed many problems and shou ld be replaced with modern parts. The elevator door upgrade will provide an opportunity to address the other numerous deficiencies of these two elevators. Elevator 35 is a passenger/freight elevator that requires new counter rollers. Elevator 36 is a freig ht elevator that is used more often than any other elevator in the West Court and therefore requires complete modernization. PROGRESS TO DATE: By working with vertical transportation experts, the Smithsonian has identified the new parts and equipment re quired to bring the four elevators up to modern code standards, including life -safety compliance. Detailed scopes of work are being developed for each of the deficient elevators. IMPACT OF DELAY: If any of the elevators were to fail, it would have a significant impact on operations in the West Court area of the Museum. Due to the advanced age of the equipment, it takes a long time to locate replacement parts, keeping the elevators out of service. Without reliable elevators, food service and trash remo val into the basement would be very difficult, which would negatively affect the visitors' experience to a great extent. 250 PROJECT TITLE: Upgrade Electronic Security System INSTALLATION: Fort Pierce Research Station LOCATION: Fort Pierce, Florida FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $300* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING: $200* Total $500* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design . PROJECT BACKGROUND : Created in 1969, the Smithsonian Marine Science Station in Fort Pierce, Florida is dedicated to studying south Florida's ecosystems and biodiversity. It has evolved from its first home on a World War II -vintage floating barge to a campus with structures de signed in a simple tropical style. The Tyson House is a modern version of tropical vernacular architecture prevalent at the Station. Designed by Florida architect Peter Jefferson in 1977 for Peter and Jeanne Tyson, it was relocated from Vero Beach, Florida to the research Station as a gift from the owners. Today it is used as a residence for visiting scientists. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The building's electronic security systems are reaching the end of their useful life expectancy and need to be upgraded to meet current Smithsonian security standards. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $300,000 in FY 2024 to upgrade electronic security systems to meet current security standards. The Fort Pierce Research Station's electronic security systems modernization project will include installation of fiber -optic infrastructure, data -gathering panels, network video recorders, ac cess readers, cameras, intercoms, and intrusion -detection devices. PROGRESS TO DATE: The d esign for the system has been delayed due to COVID -19 pandemic travel restrictions which have prevented Smithsonian personnel, who are responsible for inspections a nd surveys, from being on site. Survey work is expected to commence by the fourth quarter of FY 2023. IMPACT OF DELAY: Delaying the project will leave the Fort Pierce Scientific Research Station with security devices which are near the end of their usefu l life, making them more prone to failure. It will also leave the building out of compliance with current Smithsonian and industry best -practice security standards, posing a potential risk to on -site staff and their data and work. 251 PROJECT TITLE: Replac e Collection Storage Air -Handling Units, Floors 4 and 5 INSTALLATION: LOCATION: National Museum of American History (NMAH) Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $5,000* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING : $6,300* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING: $2,500* Total * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. $13,800* PROJECT BACKGROUND : The National Museum of American History (NMAH), Kenneth E. Behring Center, opened to the public in 1964 and is one of the Smithsonian's most visited museums. This classic modern building (752,000 gross square feet) contains various exhibitions that explore America's technological, scientific, cultural, and political history. A 2 006 master plan generated a series of public space renewal projects, clarifying circulation, modernizing building systems and finishes, and incorporating innovative black -box galleries for exhibit installations. To date, renewal of public floors one, two, and three, totaling approximately 240,000 square feet in the center core and West Wing of the Museum, is complete. The future East Wing public space renewal project will begin in FY 2026. An updated master plan, completed in 2018, provides recommendations for continued modernization of building systems, revitalizations of the spaces on the remaining floors of the building, primarily containing workspaces, collections storage and food service, and improvements to the extensive grounds surrounding the Museum, including better flood protection. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The current air-conditioning units (ACUs) 1 -4 serve the fourth and fifth floor collections storage areas. The ACUs are about 25 years old and are at or past most estimates of useful ACU service l ife. Even with constant maintenance, the equipment cannot meet the need for environmental protection of the diverse collections at this Museum. The NMAH should benefit from a significant improvement to its energy use profile, and see reduced energy costs, after the total air -handling unit (AHU) system project is completed. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $5.0 million in FY 2024 to continue the project that is slated to start in FY 2023. This project will replace all aging, major ACUs with ne w AHUs serving collection storage spaces on the fourth and fifth floors. These new units will improve the collection storage environment on the fourth and fifth floors. Two types of air - handling systems will be used. The first type will be a constant volume reheat system, and the second type will be a constant volume reheat system with a desiccant dehumidification wheel. The second type of air -handling system will be deployed for areas which require a cooler, drier climate. All air -handling eq uipment will produce a minimum of six air changes per hour, as specified for collection storage spaces in the 2019 American Society of 252 Heating, Refrigeration, and Air -Conditioning Engineers' HVAC Applications Handbook . The project will also include install ing new hot-water converters to generate hot water, which will replace aging steam reheat coils within the fourth -floor mechanical rooms. Also, temporary cooling will need to be provided for collections storage spaces during construction, when the air -hand ling systems are not yet operational. The area of work will be confined to the mechanical rooms on the fourth floor and penthouse level . PROGRESS TO DATE: The construction documents are complete and will be issued for bid in March of FY 2023. The construction contract is expected to be awarded later in FY 2023. IMPACT OF DELAY: Air-conditioning equipment will continue to degrade, and increased maintenance will be required if this work is not done soon. Collections in the storage space s will be at higher risk of damage due to potential failures and emergency shutdowns. 253 PROJECT TITLE: Renovate East Wing, Floors 2 -4 INSTALLATION: National Museum of American History (NMAH) LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $2,500* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING : $1,000* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING : $123,000* Total $126,500* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design . PROJECT BACKGROUND : The National Museum of American History (NMAH), Kenneth E. Behring Center , opened to the public in 1964 and is one of the Smithsonian's most visited museums. This classic modern building (752,000 gross square feet) contains various exhibitions that explore America's technological, scientific, cultural, and political history. A 2006 master plan generated a series of public space renewal projects, clarifying circulation, modernizing building systems and finishes, and incorporat ing innovative black -box galleries for exhibit installations. To date, renewal of public floors one, two, and three, totaling approximately 240,000 square feet in the center core and West Wing of the Museum, is complete. The future East Wing public space r enewal project will begin in FY 2026. An updated master plan, completed in 2018, provides recommendations for continued modernization of building systems, revitalization of the spaces on the remaining floors of the building, primarily containing workspaces, collections storage, and food service, and improvements to the extensive grounds surrou nding the Museum, including better flood protection. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The 2006 master plan (updated in 2018) noted that the East Wing requires major revitalization of its exhibit galleries and public spaces, as well as expansions of educational, interactive, and multimedia offerings. Currently the East Wing's infrastructure does not meet the needs of the Museum staff or the public. The exterior ribbon windows and center core window curtain walls are failing, allowing water to infiltra te, and in some instances the ribbon windows have become detached. The escalators also require the same type of refurbishing as was done in the West Wing renovation . In addition, the heating, ventilation, and air -conditioning (HVAC) and fire -protection sys tems require upgrading to accommodate this revitalization. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $2.5 million in FY 2024 to continue moving collections to storage facilities to make way for the revitalization . The Public Space Renewal Program IV (PSRP IV) is the major revitalization of the three public floors on the east side of the building. Most of the revitalization will be on the second and third floors, which are the major public floors. Major systems, including HVAC, vertical tran sportation, and lighting , will be updated to support the modern exhibit experience for educational, interactive, and multimedia offerings. In addition, space currently used for collections storage and offices 254 will be converted to gallery shells ready for f uture exhibits . Elements of the building's perimeter enclosure, including the four stories of ribbon windows and center core curtain window walls, will be replaced. There will be additional work to replace the perimeter heat convection units on the non -public fourth floor. When this work is completed, it will create the perception of the entire building being one cohesive space. The East Wing will complement the revitalized West Wing (PSRP III); however, the East Wing will focus on a cleaner aesthetic with fewer visual interruptions in the exhibit spaces, as requested by the Pre-Project Planning Steering Committee. Funds permitting, the lower levels will be revitalized in FY 2031. PROGRESS TO DATE: The construction documents for the PSRP IV collections sw ing space were completed in January of 2023 and t he construction contract is expected to be awarded later in FY 2023. The Architect/Engineer for the revitalization project has been selected and the initial design contract is expected to be awarded later in FY 2023. The construction is planned between FY s 2026 and 2028. IMPACT OF DELAY: Delays will increase the Smithsonian Institution's exposure to risks associated with infrastructure failure, which poses a safety hazard for visitors and staff, as well as a security risk to the national collections. While mitigation strategies are being i mplemented, they are not permanent. An example is the Museum's fa\u00e7ade window that fell in 2019. The NMAH's relevance, ease of operations , and capacity to generate revenue could be further negatively affected by the delay. 255 PROJECT TITLE : INSTALLATION: LOCATION: Mitigate Water Infiltration on First Floor National Museum of American History (NMAH) Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $300* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $300* PROJECT BACKGROUND : The National Museum of American History (NMAH), Kenneth E. Behring Center, opened to the public in 1964 and is one of the Smithsonian's most visited museums. This classic modern building (752,000 gross square feet) contains various exhibitions that explore America's technological, scientific, cultural, and political history.

PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: Recently, water infiltration has been observed on the first floor, in multiple locations , including in the On the Water exhibit, the Lemelson Center, the Records Room ( that contains valuable coll ections), training rooms , and offices. It is imperative to start remediating the issue before it becomes more extensive and damages the national collections . PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $300,000 in FY 2024 to fix the most critical problems on the terrace. PROGRESS TO DATE: Construction documents will be completed in FY 20 23, with the contract award expected in early FY 2024. IMPACT OF DELAY: Unless the leaks on the terrace level are repaired soon, valuable collections will continue to be at risk for damage and water infiltration could result in closing the America on the Move exhibit. 256 PROJECT TITLE: Revitalize Sculpture Garden and Tunnel INSTALLATION: Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (HMSG) LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars ): $10,000* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING : $11,700 * ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING : $9,460 * Total $31,160* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. PROJECT BACKGROUND : The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (HMSG), the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of modern and contemporary art, was designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft, FAIA, of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, and opened to the public in 1974. The Museum is locate d at the northwest corner of 7th Street and Independence Avenue, SW, and the Sculpture Garden is north of the Museum across Jefferson Drive. The building is cylindrical in shape, 231 feet in diameter, and raised 14 feet above a paved plaza, on four concret e piers. The building is clad with precast concrete panels with crushed pink granite aggregate. The center of the drum is a circular courtyard with a large, shallow, bronze fountain. The Museum building has four above -ground stories and a lower level below the plaza that surrounds the building. The Sculpture Garden occupies 1.56 acres on the north side of Jefferson Drive and is connected to the Museum plaza by a tunnel below the street. Between 1977 and 1981, Lester Collins was charged with transforming Bun shaft's original design for the Sculpture Garden into the current blended plan, which focused on improved functionality and accessibility. Around the same time, the tunnel below Jefferson Drive was closed to pedestrians and fitted out to house the Museum's art education center. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The exposed aggregate walls of the Sculpture Garden are degrading due to \"concrete disease\" caused by additives commonly used in concrete during the period of construction. The garden floods after significant rainfall due to a lack of adequate stormwater drainage. The tunnel below Jefferson Drive lacks adequate waterproofing and is prone to leaks. In addition, the current configuration of the garden does not suit the programmatic needs of the Museum for the di splay of large -scale artworks or for performance art. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $10.0 million in FY 2024 to revitalize the Sculpture Garden. The concrete perimeter retaining walls will be reconstructed and new walls will be built along the garden's interior. Accessible entries to the garden will be provided from both the Mall and Jefferson Drive. The structure of the tunnel below Jefferson Drive will be properly waterproofed and reopened to pedestrian traffic between the Sculpture Garden and the Museum 's plaza. Improved stormwater management will alleviate the flooding problem. 257 The HMSG has commissioned the world -renowned artist Hiroshi Sugimoto as the \"Design Architect\" to reimagine the HMSG Sculpture Garden. The revitalized Sculp ture Garden will incorporate design characteristics from both Gordon Bunshaft's original design and Lester Collins's revision. There will be more flexible and responsive exhibition spaces for contemporary art installations, site -specific installations, and live performances. An enlarged pool in the central space will incorporate a stage for performance art, and an enlarged gallery area in the west section of the garden will enable the Museum to display larger works of art for which space is not currently av ailable. On the east side of the garden, the renovated walls will create intimate gallery areas more suitable for the display of the Museum's significant collection of bronze sculptures. PROGRESS TO DATE: Final construction documents are complete , with construction award expected in the third quarter of FY 2023. IMPACT OF DELAY: Delaying the revitalization of the Hirshhorn Sculpture Garden will allow the concrete walls to continue to decay and leave the art in the garden at risk of repeated fl ooding. It would also leave the tunnel walls and roof prone to further damage from water leaks . Longer term, the Museum building is slated for revitalization, and postponing the garden revitalization project would put the start of that project in jeopardy because the limited size of the whole HMSG site prevents both projects from being done simultaneously. 258 PROJECT TITLE: INSTALLATION: LOCATION: Revitalize Naos Laboratory Buildings Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (S Naos Site, Panama TRI) FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $2,500* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING : $4,500* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING: $17,000* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $24,000* PROJECT BACKGROUND : Located in Panama City, the Naos Marine and Molecular Laboratory site provides facilities for Pacific Ocean marine research, intertidal zones behavioral research, archaeology, and evolutionary speciation of terrestrial plants and animals. The laboratories house a seawater system that uses molecular biology tools to study marine organisms, their behaviors, ecology, and physiology, and their inter action with invasive species. Among many other research activities, environmental monitoring programs study the impact of human activities on coral reefs and other marine ecosystems. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: With the renewal of the Contract with the Nation of Panama, STRI will continue to occupy the current Naos Laboratories well into the future , allowing it to continue focusing research on the biological diversity and wonders of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean. To continue to fulfill its mission, STRI ne eds to modernize and reconfigure spaces as well as update the electrical and mechanical systems of its buildings, which will house essential and long -term experiments, along with several marine biology and archeological collections assembl ed by STRI scientists through the years. Additionally, with the requested funds, unoccupied structures will be repurposed and rebuilt to serve new functions, including housing for an enhanced seawater processing system. Finally, the reconstruction and repurposing o f old buildings will fully enable the modernization of the site for current and future research, an efficient use of space , and the overall renovation of the Smithsonian presence in the prime Panama City location where Naos is located. PROJECT DESCRIPTIO N: The Smithsonian requests $2.5 million in FY 2024 to start the project with the demolition of Building 332, which will be replaced by the new seawater system within this footprint, including the wing of the New Building Complex that will replace the exi sting laboratories. Conceptual studies of the new laboratory building complex call for phasing it into two modules, with one of them working as swing space to allow the project to be built without relocating the program. Additionally, this project will inc lude allocation of dedicated spaces for the storage of STRI\u00b4s marine biology and archaeology collections. After the conclusion of the project, laboratory buildings 359 and 352 will be demolished and permanently replaced with the new building. 259 PROGRESS TO D ATE: The concept design for the Naos site was completed in February of 2022. Currently, the design is in its schematic phase to determine the final layout of the building's floorplans. The design is projected to be complete in December of 2023. The constr uction contract award is targeted for mid -2024. IMPACT OF DELAY: The planned long -term presence of STRI at the Naos site demands proper revitalization and modernization of the existing buildings' spaces and electrical and mechanical systems, and the reconfiguration and repurposing of existing science program spaces to f it current needs. Additionally, much of Building 332 has deteriorated and requires renovation and reconstruction. Although this building's roof and exterior siding were recently repaired to keep the structure from becoming hazardous to occupy, a full renov ation is required to use these spaces to their full potential and for specific scientific functions. This major revitalization project will bring STRI's essential research site up to required standards for a new generation of scientists who are continuing to provide broader research diversity. STRI plans to base its long -term Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean research at the revitalized Naos site facilities . 260 PROJECT TITLE: INSTALLATION: LOCATION: Replace and Improve Galeta Facilities Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (S Galeta Site, Panama TRI) FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $3,400* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING : $2,300* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING : $12,000* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $17,700* PROJECT BACKGROUND : The Galeta Marine Station is located near the Caribbean terminal of the Panama Canal and the city of Colon. It serves as a laboratory and marine and wetland environmental monitoring station, as well as an education and outreach center for STR I. The site includes several small dormitories, a laboratory building, a small administration structure, and support buildings. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The buildings at Galeta Marine Station are located directly on an eroding shoreline and are experiencing seawater infiltration during high tides and windy conditions. In addition, the existing laboratory and dormitories are located in old, outdated buildings which do not comply with current building safety codes. Among the many deficiencies, they do not have a fire-suppression system and the current sanitary and potable water systems are substandard. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $3.4 million in FY 2024 to begin Phase 2 of this project, which includes a new wastewater system, upgrades to the existing main electrical and communication systems, and new shoreline barriers to protect the land and buildings from sea erosion. As part of STRI's Facilities Master Plan, the existing dormitories and laboratory will be replaced with code -compliant structures to safely host the research, education, and outreach activities. Subsequent phases of this project will incorporate a replacement laborat ory/administration building (Phase 3) and a replacement dormitory building (Phase 4). PROGRESS TO DATE: Design is complete and construction contract award for Phase 1 is expected in the fourth quarter of FY 2023. IMPACT OF DELAY: The Galeta Marine Station requires major renovations at many essential facilities, including the laboratory, administration building, and dormitories. Basic infrastructure systems for sanitary and potable water urgently need upgrades. Delaying this project will incre ase maintenance costs and impair STRI's ability to conduct research and educational programs at the Galeta site, and potentially endanger visitors and staff. In addition, the potable water installation at the site is not big enough to meet future demands a nd needs to be upgraded and modernized. 261 PROJECT TITLE: INSTALLATION: LOCATION: Renovate Tupper Laboratory Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) Tupper Site, Panama FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $1,700* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING: $1,500* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $3,200* PROJECT BACKGROUND : The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute's administrative base is the Earl S. Tupper Research and Conference Center located on Ancon Hill. This complex includes a library, lecture hall, laboratories, and offices, and was designed by the Panamanian archi tect Octavio Mendez Guardia , and dedicated in 1990. It was built on the site of the historic 1906 Tivoli Hotel, which was demolished in 1975, where visitors came to view the construction of the Panama Canal. The main structure is the Tupper Building, which houses several administrati ve and research programs, as well as the main offices for STRI's director. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: While the Tupper Building continues to be operational through maintenance actions and programs that have helped preserve the building through the years, there are areas, systems, and finishes which have deteriorated over time and need modernizing to ensure the building can remain functional. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $1.7 million in FY 2024 to continue making improvements to the laboratory spaces, bathrooms, ceiling s, and other refurbishments in nearby structures such as the Maintenance Shop and the SF Building ( also known as the Pastor House), as well as improvements to the Tupper campus driveway. PROGRESS TO DATE: The design contract has been awarded . Completion of the first phase of design documents is expected by the fourth quarter of FY 2023. IMPACT OF DELAY: Delaying this project will increase the deterioration of laborator y spaces, eventually rendering them unusable. Refurbishing the shops and engineering buildings will allow users to operate in safer , more adequate facilities for their current and future needs. 262 PROJECT TITLE: Revitalize Gamboa Building 56 INSTALLATION: Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) LOCATION: Panama COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $3,300* Total $3,300* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. PROJECT BACKGROUND : The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) has used the Old Gamboa Schoolhouse Building (Bldg. 56) for the academic program's housing and classrooms for courses provided by STRI for Gamboa and surrounding area field studies. B uilding 56 is an old concrete and wooden structure that was built in the 1930s, and was originally the elementary school building of the town of Gamboa during the Panama Canal Commission years. Academic programs will continue to be one of the Institute's flagship operations so the need for a permanent space to host overseas science students makes this building essential for STRI's operations at Gamboa. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: Building 56 is a 90 -year-old structure that has been damaged by the weather, insects , and the use of air-conditioning units running constantly in non -insulated spaces that has created excessive condensation throughout the wooden elements of structure , including the ceilings, flooring , and wooden supports. The deterioration level has reached a point that a reconstruction is required. All the wooden and natural building elements need to be replaced with more appropriate building materials for the hot and humid environment the building must endure. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The S mithsonian requests $3.3 million in FY 2024 for the reconstruction of Building 56. The project will eliminate the wooden supporting elements, ceilings and partitions , that are susceptible to deterioration in the tropical weather , and replace them with conc rete, steel, and synthetic materials to make the building weather and termite resistant in Gamboa's harsh climate. In addition, to bring the building into code - compliance, new electrical and mechanical systems will be installed and the building will be rec onfigured to meet Americans with Disabilities Act compliance standards as well as to accommodate lodging researchers and students and to provide lab spaces for academic groups. PROGRESS TO DATE: The design phase is currently in progress , and completion of the 65 percent design documents is expected in March of 2023. The design is expected to be fully completed by the end of calendar year 2023. Construction is targeted to be contracted by mid -2024. 263 IMPACT OF DELAY: Delaying this much -needed refurbishment will continue to place an excessive burden on maintenance to fix a deter iorating building as well as put research staff at risk due to the delay in bringing the structur e and systems into code -compliance. 264 PROJECT TITLE: Improve Fire -Alarm and Life -Safety Systems INSTALLATION: Research Institute (STRI) LOCATION: FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of $1,000* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING : $800* Total $1,800* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. PROJECT BACKGROUND : STRI has a research facility at Gamboa, which is located on the east bank of the Panama Canal, 17 miles north of Panama City and 13 miles south of Barro Colorado Island (BCI), is midway between both sites , and provides an excellent location f or terrestrial scientific investigation s. The buildings at STRI must endure harsh tropical weather environments with high temperature and high humidity in nearby dense forests and/or by sea -front locations. These conditions have caused the deterioration of the existing fire -alarm systems, including a high rate of false alarms. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The current fire -alarm systems need to be reconfigured. The fire -alarm panels, and associated electronic devices, are placed in undesirable locations where they are directly exposed to the high temperature and humidity that are eroding the panels at a faster rate than expected. In addition, the panels and remote alarms are not placed where first responders can receive signals and provide adequate response time s. Reconfiguring the fire -detection system will provide longer life expectancy of the equipment, reduce the number of calls, decrease maintenance costs, and provide staff with a safe and less troublesome fire -alarm system. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $1.0 million in FY 2024 to begin improving the fire - alarm system. The project will move the fire -detection equipment out of harsh weather environments, plac e the fire -alarm panels in climate -controlled spaces , and move the remote alarms closer to the first responders. PROGRESS TO DATE: The design phase is in development. The design of the first phase will be complete by the end of calendar year 2023. The c onstruction contract for this first phase should be awarded by mid -2024. IMPACT OF DELAY: Modernizing the fire -alarm systems is a high priority and will also reduce maintenance costs as well as improve workplace safety , so a delay of this project would prevent STRI from realizing these benefits . 265 PROJECT TITLE : Replace Laboratory and Storage Pod Air Handling Units INSTALLATION: Museum Support Center (MSC) Suitland, COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars ): $4,500 * PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING : $19,700 * ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING: $10,500* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $34,700* PROJECT BACKGROUND : The Museum Support Center (MSC) at the Smithsonian Institution's SCC is the Smithsonian's largest collections storage facility. Opened in 1983, the three -story structure has five separate storage areas (pods), as well as laboratories and office areas to support the care and analysis of the Institution's valuable collections of objects and documents. The storage pods and labs/offices are separated by a n access corridor (known as the \"Street\") that allows movement of objects within the building. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: Eleven of the air -handling units (AHUs) supporting the heating, ventilation, and air - conditioning (HVAC) system in Pods 1, 2, and 4, the \"Street,\" and the lab/office areas are original to the building and have exceeded their useful lives. They urgently require replacement. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $4.5 million in FY 2024 to replace AHUs in Pod 1 and the \"Street\" cir culation corridor. The AHU replacements will occur in four sequenced projects. Each multi -year project will be funded for two years. This is the third of the four sequenced projects. The AHUs will be replaced one at a time to ensure that the controlled collections environment is maintained in the facility throughout the process. PROGRESS TO DATE: The design for the pod AHU replacement was completed in June of 2017 and designs for the lab/office and \"Street\" AHU replacements were completed in January of 2020. The contract for construction of the first project ( in Labs 3 and 4), funded in FYs 2020 and 2021, was awarded in September of 2020 and is now complete. Phase 2 in the sequence was awarded in FY 2022. This project (Phase 3) specifically re places the AHUs in Pods 1 and 2, with funding in FYs 2024 and 2025. The fourth and last project (Phase 4) will follow in FYs 2026 and 2027. IMPACT OF DELAY: Failure to continue replacing the AHUs in a timely manner will put the facility's collections en vironment, and the priceless objects contained in the pods, at risk. 266 PROJECT TITLE: Decontaminate Objects in Building 16 INSTALLATION: Building 16, Silver Hill Facility (SHF) LOCATION: Suitland Collections Center (SCC), (Thousands of Dollars): $1,000* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING : $1,000 * ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING: $1,000 * * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $3,000 * PROJECT BACKGROUND : A study of the Smithsonian's collections storage space has identified the Suitland Collections Center, specifically, the Garber collections storage site, as having almost half of the Smithsonian's below -acceptable collections space. Much of the more than 230,000 square f eet of space, including Building 16, is compromised by hazardous materials in and around the collections. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: Building 16 contains collections which have been contaminated with asbestos from the interior building insulation. Encapsulat ion systems to shield the objects from the asbestos have failed and only a few highly trained and qualified Smithsonian staff are permitted in the building. The collections within the building are not available for research, exhibition, display, or loan, a nd are off limits to academia and the public. Funds received in FY 2017 and earlier were used to build temporary collections storage swing space and to decontaminate collections in other buildings. Building 16 is the next logical phase in this sequence. Th is project will decontaminate the collections objects in Building 16 and move them to a suitable storage location at the recently decontaminated and renovated Building 15. The collections will then be accessible for inventory, condition assessment, and research and exhibition. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $1.0 million in FY 2024 to decontaminat e the collections in Phase 3. This labor -intensive process includes accounting and inventory assessments, stabilizing the collection, and moving cleaned collections into a temporary swing space (Building 15) at the Garber facility. This swing space will ser ve as the staging area for emergency conservation and treatment, as well as packing and crating, until the items can be permanently moved into the Museum Support Center's new Pod 6 when that facility is completed. Phases 3 and 4 of the project will continu e to decontaminate and re -locate objects on the shelves of Building 16 and in various storage trailers adjacent to the building. PROGRESS TO DATE: The contract for Phase 1 of the project was awarded in FY 2021, and site work began in February of 2022 and was completed in June of 2022. Phase 2 of the project was awarded in June of 2022 and work continues to decontaminate object s in Aisles A and C of Building 16. 267 IMPACT OF DELAY: Given that Building 16 was constructed as a 10 -to 15 -year temporary building in 1959, a delay in decontaminating the collections objects and moving them to a suitable storage facility will perpetuate the poor care and inaccessibility of important objects and slow implementation of the Institution's Collection Spa ce Framework Plan and the SCC master plan. 268 PROJECT TITLE: Upgrade MSC Campus Electrical Systems INSTALLATION: Museum Support Collections Center (SCC), Suitland, Maryland FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars) : $1,000* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING : $5,000* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $6,000* PROJECT BACKGROUND: The Museum Support Center (MSC) at the Smithsonian 's SCC is the Institution's largest collections storage facility. Opened in 1983, the three -story structure has five separate storage areas (pods), as well as laboratories and office areas to support the care and analysis of the valuable collections of objec ts and documents. The storage pods and labs/offices are separated by an access corridor (known as the \"Street\") that allows movement of objects within the building. Multiple utility/electric services serve the MSC facility. The electrical systems are mostl y original to the 1983 building and are now old and at or near the end of their useful life and need upgrading or replacement. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: Electrical life -safety deficiencies, some related to arc flash, are a major concern at the MSC. This pro ject will address and correct those safety issues and provide a safe work environment as well as replace outdated and inefficient electrical equipment. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $1.0 million in FY 2024 to begin a multi -year revitalizat ion of the electrical system at the MSC, which will include replacing circuit breakers and panel boards with proper ampere -interrupting capacity (AIC) rating and circuit -breaker settings; connecting all direct digital control (DDC) panels in Pod 5 to emerg ency power; fully moderniz ing the MSC main electrical system by replacing all the equipment except Switchgear H; mitigat ing the arc flash safety concerns ; and bring ing the whole system into code -compliance. PROGRESS TO DATE: A comprehensive electrical study of the MSC was completed in FY 2021 to identify deficiencies, provide recommendations , and act as basis for the design to remedy the identified deficiencies and safety concerns. Design is planned to begin in FY 2023. IMPAC T OF DELAY: A delay will continue to put MSC staff and collections at risk due to aging and failing electrical equipment. 269 PROJECT TITLE: Improve Water System, Fred L. Whipple Observatory (Phase 3) INSTALLATION: LOCATION: Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) Amado, Arizona FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars ): $2,000* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING : $600* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING: $1,000* Total $3,600* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design . PROJECT BACKGROUND : The SAO's Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) in Arizona conducts world -renowned astrophysical research from the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) building on the summit of Mt. Hopkins as well as many other telescope sites on the peaks around the FLWO campus. The water system (above the Base Camp) that serves all the FLWO buildings was c onstructed over the course of several decades as the facility grew in response to the expanding SAO mission. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The water system has experienced service failures in recent years and is almost 40 years old. The water system draws on s ources of spring, well, and runoff water but the automated system failed several years ago and currently does not treat the water. Recent tests indicate a water quality issue that is creating a hazard to personnel health and safety. In addition, the staff must manually control pumps to refill tanks and keep the tanks tied to the fire -protection system full. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $2.0 million in FY 2024 to complete Phase 2 and begin Phase 3 of this project to replace all water, power, and communication infrastructure between the water source spring and the residence tanks. This will augment the pumping units installed within the buildings in the previous Phase 2. These pumping units will be d esigned based on pumping to the Ridge Site and a local tank. The local tank is the existing 2,500 gallon Water Tank 4. At the Ridge site, a pumping station shall be designed and constructed to pump water to the Aspen site. Two existing 20,000 gallon tanks are located at the Aspen site. The addition of the water, power, and communication infrastructure will automate the safety of water potability and support a water source for fire protection. PROGRESS TO DATE: The design for phases 1 and 2 of this projec t are completed. The design work for Phase 3 is in progress and will be completed in FY 2023. Phase 1 construction is complete. Phase 2 construction has started and is expected to continue into FY s 2023 and 2024. 270 IMPACT OF DELAY: A delay in Phase 3 would raise staff life -safety issues and impair fire protection at the property. The SAO currently provides bottled water to all facilities on the mountain as a safety precaution, and this will need to continue until repairs are made. In addition, the staff must now manually control pumps to refill tanks and keep critical tanks tied to the fire - protection system full , due to the failed system that wastes considerable staff time monitoring and adjusting the chlorine levels in the storage t anks. Despite SAO's best efforts and the dedication of significant staff time, the water quality is often questionable and continues to risk the health and safety of on -site personnel. 271 PROJECT TITLE: Remediate Pests and Security Threats at Base Camp INSTALLATION: Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) FLWO LOCATION: Amado, Arizona FY 2024 COST (Thousands of Dollars): $500* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING: $2,500* Total * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. $3,000* PROJECT BACKGROUND : The SAO's Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) in Arizona conducts world -renowned astrophysical research from the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) building on t he summit of Mt. Hopkins as well as many other telescope sites on the peaks around the FLWO campus. The Base Camp serves as the administrative and operational headquarters for the entire campus. It is located at the entrance to the SAO facility and serves as the interface location with the general public. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: Due to its proximity to the Mexican border, there are increasing security threats from drug traffickers who often use the campus grounds as a smuggling route. In addition, the remo te area in the mountain is home to many rodents who have infested and nested in the buildings , leaving behind feces in ceilings and walls that could pose a health risk from the Hanta virus, which poses a safety hazard to humans. The increased security risk from the narcotics smuggling requires extra security infrastructure, however installing the security systems requires accessing the dropped ceiling s and walls of the buildings and those areas are infested with rodents and cannot be safely accessed until t he pest infestation issue is remediated. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $500,000 in FY 2024 to begin Phase 1 of the project at the Base Camp, which is the remediation of the pest infestation , by removing the dropped ceilings and eliminating entrance points into and within the building. This phase will remediate the lower -level staff areas at the Base Camp's Administration Building as well as at the adjacent Visitor Center and gift shop. The pr oject will also include adding and/or updating security systems at the buildings in the Base Camp. Subsequent phases will address similar issues at other facilities on the campus . PROGRESS TO DATE: The design for Phase 1 of this project (Base Camp ) will begin in FY 2023 and be completed early in FY 2024. IMPACT OF DELAY: A delay in the project would elevate staff life -safety issues from both the security and health perspectives. 272 PROJECT TITLE: Improve Safety on Mt. Hopkins Road INSTALLATION: Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) LOCATION: Amado, Arizona FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars) : $400* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING : $1,200* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design . Total $1,600* PROJECT BACKGROUND: The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) in Arizona conducts world -renowned astrophysical research from the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) building on the summit of Mt. Hopkins as well as many other telescope sites around the FLWO campus. The SAO is located at the summit of Mt. Hopkins, at an elevation of 8,550 feet, reachable only by Mt. Hopkins Road, a 12 - mile-long, unimproved, single -lane access road. The Smithsonian built the road more than 50 years ago to accommodate traffic by SAO research faculty, staff, and students, as well as contractors and some members of the public. Telescopes are located on the summit peaks. SAO activities on Mt. Hopkins require access between its facilities at the Base Camp (located at 4,500 feet) and the summit to conduct basic operations, research, and educational activities which form its core mission. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The surface of the single -lane road is largely unp aved, out -sloped to the canyons 1,300 feet below, and is uneven with numerous switchbacks. Several sections are sloped at a 24 -percent grade, which is well beyond the capability of most drivers, standard vehicles, and pedestrians. A driver can easily lose control of a vehicle in wet or icy condition s and these types of conditions are frequent at the altitudes where the road is located. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $400,000 in FY 2024 to continue improving road safety issues by adding safety guard rails where none currently exist. This is imperative for safe travel of Smithsonian staff, contractors, and visitors on the roads between the various sites of the FWLO. PROGRESS TO DATE: Installation of the new guard rails will begin in FY 2024. IMPACT OF DELAY: If this project is delayed, SAO staff, visitors, and scientists will continue to face increased life -safety risks when driving to and from the Observatory, especially during nightly science operations when vehicles must dim their lights to ensure optimal conditions for using the telescopes or driving when the road is slippery due to adverse weather conditions . 273 PROJECT TITLE: Install Site -wide Fall Protection, Fred L. Whipple Observatory INSTALLATION: Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) LOCATION: Amado, Arizona FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars) : $350* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING : $300* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING : $1,200* Total $1,850* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. PROJECT BACKGROUND: The SAO's Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) in Arizona conducts world -renowned astrophysical research from the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) building on the summit of Mt. Hopkins as well as many other telescope sites around the FLWO campu s. SAO activities on Mt. Hopkins require access to and from its facilities at the Base Camp and the summit to conduct basic operations, research, and educational activities which form its core mission. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: Presently, there is no safe access to the equipment on the high -pitched roof of the MMT Control Building directly over the maintenance hangar. The MMT building, located at over 8,500 feet above sea level, is subject to very extreme and suddenly changing climate conditions, which include gale -force winds and heavy ice. Personnel attempting to service this equipment are at a significant risk to their persona l safety. In addition, there are numerous other life -safety deficiencies related to fall protection that are located throughout the campus and require remediation. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $350,000 in FY 2024 to create a safe walkway and platform on the MMT Control Building roof, which will include railings and code - compliant harness attachment points. Improvements will also be made to the horizontal lifeline system (HLL) on the roof of the Veritas building as well as at other site -wide locations where employees and contractors are exposed to the risks of hazardous falls. PROGRESS TO DATE: The FLWO performed a fall hazard risk assessment in June of 2014. A study was awarded in FY 2021 that provide d a concept design for the Base Camp buildings, Ridge buildings, Summit MMT (interior and exterior), and support buildings and Ridge water tanks. Concept design was completed in June of 2022 and the final design will be comp leted in FY 2023. IMPACT OF DELAY: A delay will continue to put SAO staff and contractors who maintain the equipment on the roofs at risk of falls when doing their essential work to support the Observatory's mission. 274 PROJECT TITLE: Construct Energy Efficiency Improvements at Summit a nd Base Camp INSTALLATION: Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory ( SAO ) at Hilo and Maunakea FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars) : $800* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING : $1,000* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $1,800* PROJECT BACKGROUND: The Submillimeter Array (SMA) is the world 's first imaging interferometric telescope to operate in the major atmospheric windows from 0.3 mm to 1.3 mm. Th e Observatory is located at the summit of Maunakea, 13,368 feet above sea level, which puts it above more than 90 percent of the water vapor in the atmosphere that absorbs much of the light at the wavelengths observed by the SMA. The array consists of eigh t 6-meter -diameter movable antennas that can be positioned in different locations to provide resolution equivalent to a huge single antenna with a diameter of 0.5 km (0.3 miles) across. The SMA control building was constructed in 199 7 with a gross area of 7,500 square feet. Adjacent to the control building is the SMA Antenna Maintenance Building , commonly referred to as the SMA Hanger. At the Hilo site there is a 16,000 -square -foot office and lab building (Base Camp) to support SMA operations. Together , these structures support scientific investigation s of stars, the solar system, and exoplanets. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: Electric power for SMA operations is provided by the Hawaii Electric Light Company (HELCO). For backup power, the SMA has a diesel generator that starts within 45 seconds. There is sufficient fuel on site to only run the generator for a day or longer. By installing energy -efficient measures at both the summit (Maunakea) and Base Camp (Hilo) , significant energy savings will be realized. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $800,000 in FY 2024 to begin Phase 1 of a two -phase, multi -year funded installation of photo -voltaic (PV) panels at both the summit and Base Camp facilities. The f irst phase will address requirements at the SMA Control Building at the summit, and the second phase will install PV panels at the Base Camp facility at Hilo, Hawaii . PROGRESS TO DATE: Preliminary design is complete for Phase 1 and final design and bid documents will be completed in FY 2023. Design work for Phase 2 will begin in FY 2024. IMPACT OF DELAY: A delay will continue the loss of potential energy savings at both the summit and Base Camp facilities. 275 PROJECT TITLE: Install Additional Chiller and Controls INSTALLATION: National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars ): $500* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING : $1,000* Total * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design . $1,500* PROJECT BACKGROUND : The National Museum of African American History and Culture 's exhibits cover more than 400 years of African American history and culture. The architectural and engineering team of Freelon Adjaye Bond SmithGroup began work on the design in November of 2009. The design concept leverages the image of the Corona by placing this singular building el ement within the landscape. Reaching toward the sky, the Corona expresses faith, hope , and resiliency. Internal to the building, the Corona forms a perimeter zone that surrounds the primary galleries. Daylight enters through openings in the screen panels a nd skylights \u2014 bringing in light while providing views upward and outward. The Corona rests on a base of clear glass panels which afford generous views into and through the building as well as outward into the surrounding landscape and the Washington Monum ent grounds. The landscape design is an essential component of the visitor experience. A reflecting pool at the south entrance includes both turbulent and still waters to symbolize the African American experience in the United States . PROJECT JUSTIFICATIO N: The redundant chiller was deferred from the initial construction of the building for budget reasons. Reliability concerns for the other chillers during peak loads now support the installation of this redundant chiller. In addition, fluctuating HVAC set points during extreme temperatures, and increased maintenance due to the existing chillers' age, have caused problems with the operation of the chillers. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $500,000 in FY 2024 to continue installing a fourth c hiller and connecting it to the existing infrastructure. Additionally, operating controls will be updated to work with the existing Building Automated System (BAS). PROGRESS TO DATE: Design services were completed in the fourth quarter of FY 2022 and construction submittals are in progress. IMPACT OF DELAY: The current situation is no longer sustainable. Existing equipment is stressed to its limits during extreme weather conditions. If one of the three chillers fails, it would jeopardize the NMAAHC's collections and negatively impact both Museum staff and the public's visitor experience. 276 PROJECT TITLE: Mitigate Groundwater Infiltration INSTALLATION: National Museum of African America n History and Culture (NMAAHC) LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $750* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING : $750* Total $1,500* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. PROJECT BACKG ROUND : The National Museum of African American History and Culture's exhibits cover more than 400 years of African American history and culture. The architectural and engineering team of Freelon Adjaye Bond SmithGroup began work on the design in November of 2009 after the Smithsonian Institution selected the firm through a design competition process. The design concept leverages the image of the Corona by placing this singular building element within the landscape. Reaching toward the sky, the Corona expresses fai th, hope, and resiliency. Internal to the building, the Corona forms a perimeter zone that surrounds the primary galleries. Daylight enters this zone through openings in the screen panels and skylights \u2014 bringing in light while providing views upward and o utward. The Corona rests on a base of clear glass panels which afford generous views into and through the building as well as outward from the interior into the surrounding landscape and the Washington Monument grounds. The design of the porch reinforces i ts importance in African American culture as a gathering and welcoming space. The landscape design is an essential component of the visitor experience. A reflecting pool at the south entrance includes both turbulent and still waters to symbolize the Africa n American experience in the United States. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The Museum 's waterproofing systems are keeping a substantial portion of the groundwater out of the building and serving their intended purpose as designed. However, additional measures need to be considered for managing both the current and future expected nuisance wa ter infiltration. The Museum is situated on the grounds of the Washington Monument. The northern part of the building is the lowest portion and rests on decomposed bedrock. The southern part of the building is significantly higher, and the foundation walls and slab sit in sandy soil. The Museum is severely restricted in its ability to dewater the site, because the adjacent Washington Monument relies on the groundwater to remain level. During the design and construction project, robust waterproofing systems were implemented to keep the site water sources out of the underground portions of the building. Since construction began, the building has experienced nuisance water infiltration from various locations. For example, water has damage d tile finishes in rest rooms on the c oncourse level. Grouting has been used to fill microcracks in concrete walls and floors as needed. 277 PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $750,000 in FY 2024 to implement water mitigation strategies at the NMAAHC . PROGRESS TO D ATE: The design services contract was awarded in the fourth quarter of FY 2022 and the design work will begin in FY 2023. IMPACT OF DELAY: Not implementing water mitigation repairs in a timely manner will increase the risk of extensive damage to property, equipment, and collections at the Museum . 278 PROJECT TITLE: Improve Kitchen Exhaust Ductwork Access INSTALLATION: National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI -DC) LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 Dollars): $3,000* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING: $2,000* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING : $1,000* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $6,000* PROJECT BACKGROUND: The curvilinear asymmetry of the National Museum of the American Indian provides a strong visual contrast to the regularity of the rest of the National Mall. Designed through consultations with the diverse Native groups and tribes of the Americas, the building reflects the broad commonalities in Indian tradition which emerged from those meetings. The incorporation of nature is seen throughout the structure of the Museum, which was designed by Douglas Cardinal of the Canadian Blackfoot tribe and the Philadelphia -based architectural firm GBQC and Polshek Partnership. In its sculptural form, the building illustrates the force of nature's energy through its effect upon the Kasota sandstone. In addition, the exterior of the buildin g reflects traditional Indian culture. The landscaping contains indigenous plants from areas where Indians once lived. Water flows around three sides of the building, adding to the illusion of water -worn limestone on the curved exterior. More than 40 bould ers surround the Museum, representing ancestors of the Native Americans. The building faces east toward the rising sun, reflecting Native American tradition. The Museum opened to the public in 2004 and was launched with a week of festivities attended by mo re than 20,000 Indians from tribes across the Americas. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The kitchen exhaust system requires improvements to ensure the facility complies with life and safety requirements, and to reduce repair and maintenance costs. PROJECT DESCRIP TION: The Smithsonian requests $3.0 million in FY 2024 to improve the kitchen exhaust system. Specifically, the project will improve kitchen exhaust duct maintenance access, replace critical mechanical components, including hoods and fans, and reconfigure duct work as necessary to improve efficiency. The project will make it easier to maintain the kitchen exhaust system and reduce repair and maintenance costs, as well as provide a better visitor experience by reducing fumes emanating from the current, inad equate system . PROGRESS TO DATE: A study was completed in May of 2020 to recommend improvements to the kitchen exhaust system. Concept design began in early FY 2022. Construction documents were completed in the first quarter of FY 2023 and the construction contract is expected to be award ed in the fourth quarter of FY 2023 as a multi -year-funded project. 279 IMPACT OF DELAY: The k itchen exhaust ductwork and fans are difficult to maintain properly due to lack of access into exhaust ductwork for cleaning, causing more frequent repair and replac ement of mechanical components. Buildup of grease within exhaust ductwork due to poor drainage also poses a fire hazard and impairs compliance with life -safety code requirements. In addition, the deficiency also negatively impacts the visitor experience because strong grease odors spread to the second -floor gallery due to poorly sealed exhaust ductwork from the Mitsitam Cafe below. This project will correct those deficiencies. 280 PROJECT TITLE: Replace Steam Humidification System INSTALLATION: Smithsonian Quadrangle LOCATION: FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $2,000* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING : $1,000* Total $3,000* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design .

Sackler Gallery, and the Ripley Education Center, is a three - story, underground building that opened to the public in 1987. There are pavilion entrances to the three facilities located in the Haupt Garden, the structure 's green roof. The 389,000 -square -foot building was designed by the architectural firm of Shepley, Bullfinch, and Abbott. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The building's steam hu midification systems are reaching the end of their useful life expectancy, have experienced leaks, and need to be upgraded to meet current performance standards and provide a comfortable environment for staff and visitors and to prevent damage to the natio nal collections. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $ 2.0 million in FY 2024 to continue upgrad ing the steam humidification systems to meet current standards for collections stewardship and the comfort of staff and the visiting public. PROGRESS TO DATE: The design study was completed in FY 2022. The first phase of humidification upgrades started in FY 2023. IMPACT OF DELAY: Delaying this project will leave the Quadrangle with steam humidification systems that are near the end of their useful life, making them more prone to malfunction and failure. It will also leave the building out of compliance with current standards for collections protection, visitor comfort, and systems performance and reliability. 281 PROJECT TITLE: Replace Track Lighting at International Gallery INSTALLATION: Smithsonian Quadrangle LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $500* Total $500* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design . PROJECT BACKGROUND: The Smithsonian Quadrangle Building, which includes the National Museum of African Art, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, and the Ripley Education Center, is a three - story, underground building that opened to the public in 1987. There are pavilion entrances t o the three facilities located in the Haupt Garden, the structure 's green roof. The 389,000 -square -foot building was designed by the architectural firm of Shepley, Bullfinch, and Abbott. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The track lighting system at the Internation al Gallery, on the third level of the Quadrangle, is original to the building's construction more than 35 years ago. The old system is failing and presents a risk of electrical shock s to the staff when lighting fixtures are relocated and refocused. PROJ ECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $500 ,000 in FY 2024 to replace these track lighting systems to meet current code standards for the safety of Smithsonian staff. PROGRESS TO DATE: The design work is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of FY 2023. IMPACT OF DELAY: Delaying the project will leave the International Gallery at the Quadrangle with track lighting systems that are at the end of their useful life, making them more prone to malfunction and failure , as well as risk the safety of Smithsonian staff . 282 PROJECT TITLE: Improve Technology Infrastructure INSTALLATION: Smithsonian Quadrangle LOCATION: Washington, DC 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $500* Total $500* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design . PROJECT BACKGROUND: The Smithsonian Quadrangle Building, which includes the National Museum of African Art, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, and the Ripley Education Center, is a three - story, underground building that opened to the public in 1987. There are pavilion entrances t o the three facilities located in the Haupt Garden, the structure 's green roof. The 389,000 -square -foot building was designed by the architectural firm of Shepley, Bullfinch, and Abbott. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The education technologies at the Ripley Center classrooms have not been substantially improved since the spaces were first created . Modern teaching practices, including distance learning, require the installation of contemporary systems for online instruc tion and computer -aided lessons . PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $500 ,000 in FY 2024 to install information technology systems that meet current standards for public education programs. PROGRESS TO DATE: The design work was initiat ed in FY 2023. IMPACT OF DELAY: Delaying the project will leave the Ripley Center classrooms with education technology systems that are significantly out of date and at the end of their useful life. 283 PROJECT TITLE: Repair Combined Sanitary/Storm Sewer INSTALLATION: Donald W. Reynolds Center (DWRC) LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $2,500* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING: $2,000* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $4,500* PROJECT BACKGROUND : Originally constructed as the Patent Office Building in 1840, the Donald W. Reynolds Center is an excellent example of a Greek Revival public office building. The South Wing is the original building and is distinguished by a monumental Greek Doric -style portico. The East, West, and North Wings, added between 1852 and 1867, expanded the building to occupy two entire blocks between 7 th and 9th Streets and between F and G Streets , NW, in Washington, DC. The total gross square footage is 669,931 square feet. A major renovation of the building was completed in 2006 by Hartman Cox. In 2007, the center courtyard was enclosed by a glass canopy designed by Norman Foster. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION : The basement of the DWRC, specifically the auditorium, has experienced flooding in the past several years. The leak most likely came from the canopy columns , with the second column in the northwest corner being the most problematic. Smithsonian Facilities staff suspect the water that backed up into the column came from the city's combined sanitary and storm sewer system. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $2.5 million in FY 2024 to begin repairing the stormwater system. PROGRESS TO DATE : Design is expected to be awarded by the third quarter o f FY 2023 , with the construction award expected in FY 2024. IMPACT OF DELAY : A delay in this project would cause t he flooding in the basement to continue , which will further damage the infrastructure 's walls, floor s, carpet s, furniture, and auditorium stage and make the space unusable. The cost for repairs will only escalate to repair/replace these collateral damages. 284 PROJECT TITLE: Replace North Basement Collections Space Humidity System INSTALLATION: Donald W. Reynolds Center (DWRC) LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $500* ESTIMATED FUTURE -YEAR FUNDING: $1,500* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $2,000* PROJECT BACKGROUND : Originally constructed as the Patent Office Building in 1840, the Donald W. Reynolds Center is an excellent example of a Greek Revival public office building. The South Wing is the original building and is distinguished by a monumental Greek Doric -style portico. The East, West, and North Wings, adde d between 1852 and 1867, expanded the building to occupy two entire blocks between 7 th and 9th Streets and between F and G Streets , NW, in Washington, DC. The total gross square footage is 669,931 square feet. A major renovation of the building was complet ed in 2006 by Hartman Cox. In 2007, the center courtyard was enclosed by a glass canopy designed by Norman Foster. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION : The collection s storage space in the basement of the DWRC requires temperature and humidity controls to protect the valuable artwork and collections. The aging air - handling unit (AHU) supporting this storage is unable to provide adequate humidity control for the collection spaces, espe cially during the winter months when the air can be quite dry. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $500,000 in FY 2024 to initiate the repairs/replacement to the humidity system, AHU, and associated components. PROGRESS TO DATE : Temporary fixes were done in -house to resolve the humidity problem in the basement, yet the humidity remains below the optimal level for collections storage. The construction contract package will be developed in FY 2023 , with the award to follow in FY 2024. IMPACT OF DELAY : A delay of the project will put valuable collections and artwork in jeopardy. The artwork must be stored in a well-ventilated and control led environment to preserve it for archival purposes. 285 PROJECT TITLE: Mitigate Glass Blast Hazard INSTALLATION: Freer Gallery of Art LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 202 4 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars ): $3,500* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $3,500* PROJECT BACKGROUND : The 225,000 -square -foot Freer Gallery of Art was constructed between 1916 and 1923 on the National Mall to house the art collections of Charles Lang Freer. It was the first Smithsonian Museum devoted to the fine arts . PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The building's original bronze double -hung windows, to which aluminum storm windows have been added, do not meet contemporary standards for blast protection, putting the building occupants and collections at risk. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $3 .5 million in FY 2024 to replac e the existing windows with new, blast -rated aluminum sash es. PROGRESS TO DATE: Design specification s for the window replacement project are expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of FY 2023. IMPACT OF DELAY: If not funded, the existing windows will not be replaced, putting the public, staff, and collections at risk in the event of a blast attack . 286 PROJECT TITLE: Repair Stone Fa\u00e7ade, Phase 2 INSTALLATION: Freer Gallery of Art LOCATION: Washington, DC FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars ): $1,800* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $1,800* PROJECT BACKGROUND : The 225,000 -square -foot Freer Gallery of Art was constructed between 1916 and 1923 on the National Mall to house the art collections of Charles Lang Freer. It was the first Smithsonian Museum devoted to the fine art s. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION: The building's outward -facing stone fa\u00e7ade requires refurbishment. The stonework is soiled, chipped, and in need of selective repointing , which could lead to potential water infiltration and interior damage . PROJECT DESCR IPTION: The Smithsonian requests $ 1.8 million in FY 2024 to refurbis h the stone fa\u00e7ade. PROGRESS TO DATE: Design is expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of FY 2023 . IMPACT OF DELAY: If not funded, the required repairs will be further postponed, resulting in the continued deterioration of these character -defining elements of the building, loss of original building masonry material, and potential water infiltration and interior damage , possibly including the priceless collections housed within the building . 287 PROJECT TITLE: Construct Turbidity Filter System INSTALLATION: Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) LOCATION: Edgewater, Maryland FY 2024 C OST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars): $400* PRIOR -YEAR FUNDING : $500* * Does not include funding in Facilities Planning and Design. Total $900* PROJECT BACKGROUND : As part of its sustainable practices, SERC plans to use a water reclamation system to provide a non -potable water source for the main campus. Reclaimed water would be processed through a treatment system located at the core campus. The inten t is to be able to pump this reclaimed water to a 300,000 -gallon water storage tower located on the northern hillside. This non -potable water will be used for fire protection and other purposes. Construction of the SERC fire -protection water -distribution s ystem, which included the non -potable water tower, was competed in 2015 and a turbidity filter was added to the treatment system in 2018. Since that time, the performance of the turbidity filter has been insufficient for the reclaimed water to be used as i ntended. Because of these problems, and SERC's continued inability to use the system with the turbidity filter as currently installed, a study completed in October of 2019 assessed the existing water reclamation system and recommended improvements to the t urbidity filter as part of the overall wastewater reuse system. PROJECT DESCRIPTION : The Smithsonian requests $400,000 in FY 2024 to finish installing a new cloth - disk filter facility next to the existing ultraviolet (UV) disinfection building. PROGRESS TO DATE : A study to review the current water reclamation system and provide phased - approach recommendations was completed in October of 2019 . Repair s to the primary wastewater treatment system are complete . The design is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of FY 202 3. IMPACT OF DELAY : The existing infrastructure is in place for non -potable use of reclaimed water. Delaying the installation of the new filtration system will require SERC to continue using potable water unnecessarily while the existing reclamation system remains idle, thus wasting resources and incurring additional costs 288 PROJECT TITLE: Building Projects Less than $1,000,000 and Miscellaneous Repairs INSTALLATION: Multiple Locations LOCATION: Institution -wide FY 2024 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars) : $8,900 PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This request includes smaller individual projects of less than $1 million each, which usually involve replacement of individual systems or components and miscellaneous capital repairs needed for unplanned emergencies. In addition, this funding supports oth er Smithsonian operations, such as library support and security guard services, collections upgrades, electronic security system modernizations, swing space for one of our two new museums, and conservation and related studies. PROJECT TITLE: Constructi on Supervision and Administration INSTALLATION: Multiple Locations LOCATION: Institution -wide FY 202 4 COST ESTIMATE (Thousands of Dollars) : $9,500 PROJECT DESCRIPTION : This request supports the essential specialized work associated with Facilities Capital Program projects. A total of 53 FTEs will be funded from the $9.5 million. These positions will consist of permanent and temporary construction management and cost -engineering staff, program managers in branch offices, five contract spec ialists, a historic preservation specialist, and term and temporary staff required to perform the specialized work associated with Facilities Capital Program projects. Included in this request is $1.0 million to hire additional staff necessary to begin cre ating the congressionally mandated National Museum of the American Latino and the Smithsonian American Women's History Museum . These personnel will assist with planning, design, site selection, programming, cost estimating , and environmental assessments for the two new museums . Construction management staff supervise and administer construction contracts. They directly supervise construction contractors to ensure that quality work is performed safely, resolve issues that arise during construction, negotiate change orders, approve payments, and perform other administrative functions as contracting officers' technical representatives . A central construction management administration section coordinates all funding, contract changes, tech nical issues, and project physical and financial closeout s. Cost engineers develop Independent Government Estimates for every stage of project development, as well as analyze consultant -prepared construction cost estimates and contractor cost proposals f or construction contract awards and change orders . On-site program managers ensure adequate oversight of projects in branch offices by using scope, schedule , and budget controls to directly lead major construction projects, as well as many smaller projects . Contract specialists help procure contract services to obtain the essential 289 expertise required to execute the Facilities Capital Program, thereby ensuring the timely award of planning, design, and construction contracts. The historic preservation speci alist supports capital projects for five National Historic Landmarks, as well as all the historic Smithsonian buildings on the National Mall, thus fulfilling the federal requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. This includes working with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation ; guiding the Section 106 federal program working with the Washington, DC Historic Preservation Officer; managing consultants who help prepare Historic Structures Reports and assist in the conservation of building materials; and providing general in -house architectural history research, technical reviews , and consultations. 290 FACILITIES PLANNING AND DESIGN Feasibility studies, needs assessments, and design for capital projects are required before site work can take place. This category includes all costs for contract facility master planning, preliminary and final designs for all revitalization and construct ion projects, special studies, and a small amount for facility engineering, capital leveraging, and research activities, such as those functions performed at the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. This funding will enable development of project baselines, including costs, scopes, and schedules, prior to receiving funds to perform the work. To plan and design ahead of Capital Program execution, funding of approximately 15 to 20 percent of the following year's program is required each year. The Planning and Design funding requested for FY 2024 will complete designs for projects planned for FY 2025 and provide necessary planning and design to the 35 percent stage for most projects included in the planned FY 2026 program. This will move the Institution closer to meeting the National Academy of Public Administration's (NAPA) recommendation that firm baselines be established before preparation of funding requests so budgets submitted provide more accurate cost estimates and enable timely award of construction contracts upon receipt of future -year funding. The Institution requests a total of $44,80 0,000 for planning and design in FY 2024. These funds will be used for site evaluations, early planning, and support for two new museums established by Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021: the Smithsonian American Women's History Museum and the National Museum of the American Latino ($2.0 million). These funds will continue design work for the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden major revitalization ($6.0 million); major revitalization of the National Museum of American History, includ ing renovation of the East Wing ($9.7 million) and other projects ($1. 8 million); the National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute ($10.0 million); major revitalization projects at the National Museum of Natural History ($3.2 million); the Smithsonian E nvironmental Research Center projects ($0.4 million); the Donald W. Reynolds Center projects ($0.3 million); security -related projects, including electronic security system modernizations at various facilities ($1.4 million); the National Postal Museum pro jects ($1.2 million); the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum projects ($0.5 million); and various collections storage improvement projects ($0.6 million). These funds will also be used to design many smaller revitalization projects and security upgra des, and for space utilization studies and smaller master planning initiatives ($7. 7 million), which will help guide the Smithsonian's future facilities decisions and ensure more effective use of existing space. 291 CONSTRUCTION PROJECT TITLE: Construct Pod 6 INSTALLATION: Suitland Collections Center (SCC) LOCATION: Suitland, Maryland (Dollars in $000s) Smithsonian Institution National Gallery of Art FY 2024 Cost Estimate Design $0 $0 FY 2024 Cost $37,000 $24,57 4 Prior -Year Funding Design $6,850 $2,610 Prior -Year Funding Construction $43,600 $38,670 Estimated Future -Year Funding Construction $13,800 $5,646 TOTAL $101,250 $71,500 PROJECT BACKGROUND : The Paul E. Garber Facility in Suitland, Maryland is one of the first off -site storage spaces for the Smithsonian Institution's collections. The structures were originally built as 10 - 15-year temporary buildings in the 1950s but have been in use ever since and still serve as one of the primary off -site collections storage spaces for the Smithsonian. An evaluation of SI collections storage space identified the Garber collections storage site as containing almost 50 percent of the Smithsonian's unacceptable collections space. Much of the more than 384,700 square feet of space at Garber does not meet current building code requirements for structural support, is compromised by hazardous materials, and does not provide the proper environmental conditions to adequ ately preserve the nation's priceless artifacts stored there. Construction of Pod 6 is the last phase of the Museum Support Center (MSC) complex project that began years ago at the Suitland Collections Center (SCC) campus and was one of the first projects identified in the SCC master plan. It is a three -story collections storage module to b e built next to the Pod 4 storage module and will be shared with the National Gallery of Art (NGA) under a special partnership agreement. Approximately 58 percent of the building will be occupied by the Smithsonian and 42 percent will be occupied by the NG A. Accordingly, the Smithsonian will fund 58 percent of the total construction costs and 42 percent will be funded by the NGA. The completion of Pod 6 will allow Phase 1 of the 40 -year SCC master plan to begin and will enable the Smithsonian to move a s ignificant number of its remaining collections out of the aging buildings of the Paul E. Garber Facility while also providing permanent , state -of-the- art collections storage facilities for both the Smithsonian and the National Gallery of Art. PROJECT JUS TIFICATION: The 2014 Collection Space Framework Plan identified increasing collections storage capacity as a primary goal for the Smithsonian to address unacceptable conditions, allow decompression, anticipate future growth, and reduce the Institution's reliance on and recurring costs for leased collections storage space. Concurrently, the NGA identified a similar need for a permanent, non -leased, climate -controlled facility to properly house, process, and conserve their priceless works of art. Their existi ng off -site storage, leased from a third party, is not 292 adequate in terms of quality or quantity, and can no longer accommodate the NGA's collections growth. Constructing the Pod 6 collections storage module will be a cost -effective first step in meeting th ese goals for both cultural institutions. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Smithsonian requests $37.0 million in FY 2024 to continue construction of Pod 6. A feasibility study completed in FY 2016 envisioned a 130,000 -square -foot addition on the west side of the MSC. The module will include space for collections from the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Postal Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and the NGA. This custom -designed module will give the Smithsonian Institution and the NGA a well -planned and executed structure that will provide conservation and preservation for some the most si gnificant historical artifacts and prestigious works of art in the world. When built, the module will maintain these national treasures under strict and efficient humidity and temperature controls, thus ensuring their preservation for generations to come. Pod 6 will provide 145,538 net square feet of storage space, which includes 84,214 net square feet for the Smithsonian and 61,324 net square feet for the NGA. Project design was completed in the second quarter of FY 2022, with the construction contract awarded in the last week of September of 2022 . PROGRESS TO DATE: The schematic design phase is complete. A Project Definition Rating Index meeting was held in June of 2020, ensuring that the design is moving forward in accordance with the Construction Indus try Institute standards. Thirty -five (35) percent design was submitted in September of 2020 and a Value Engineering study was completed in late 2020 to identify where cost savings and efficiencies can be realized. Sixty -five (65) percent design was receive d in April of 2021 and final design and construction documents were submitted in January of 2022. In addition, a Memorandum of Understanding for the design, construction, and use of Pod 6 has been signed by the senior leaders of both the Smithsonian Instit ution and the NGA . The construction contract solicitation occurred in June of 2022 and was awarded in September of 2022. IMPACT OF DELAY: A delay of the Pod 6 project will require both the Smithsonian and the NGA to continue storing precious artifacts in areas with substandard conditions, such as the basements of the Mall museums which are often subject to flooding. In addition, without this new module, the NGA will need to continue leasing substandard collections storage space at a substantial cost. A delay would also set back other museum renovation projects because part of the intended use of Pod 6 is to provide swing space for collections which need to be stored during other essential construction projects. Finally, such a delay would impair the Smithsonian's private -sector fund raising because benefactors and donors are more likely to endow museums and galleries when they know there will be permanent safekeeping of their gifts for the public good . 293 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 294 TAB 4 APPENDIX SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION PROPOSED - F EBRUARY 2023 Board of Regents Secretary Chief of Staff General Counsel Office of the Regents Inspector General Assistant Secretary Communications and External Affairs and Chief Marketing Officer Assistant Secretary Advancement Director, Equal Emp. & Supplier Diversity Contracting & Pers.

Includes the George Gustav Heye Center in New York City and the Cultural Resources Center (CRC) in Suitland, Maryland. 3. The drop in visit s in FY 2019 is due to the federal Government shutdown (in January of 2019), the partial closure of the National Air and Spac e Museum for a major renovation project, and a revised counting methodology. 4. The drop in visits in FYs 2020 -2022 is due to the COVID -19 pandemic closures in March of 2020 and thereafter. 5. The AIB increase in visitation in FY 2022 is due to the opening of the FUTURES exhibit. 296 TRUST FUNDS In addition to support provided by federal appropriations, the Smithsonian Institution receives and generates trust funds to expand and enrich its programs. Trust funds are used to leverage the Smithsonian's research capacity through partnerships with federal agencies, universities, non -Governmental organizations, industry, and other private organizations, both national and international. Trust funds are also raised to renova te and modernize exhibits throughout the Institution. The following summary provides an overview of the current sources of trust funds. The Institution's trust funds include general trust funds with limited or no restrictions on their use, funds restric ted by the donor or sponsor, and Government grants and contracts. Projections are subject to the uncertainty of the size of d onations, grants, and contracts ; to fluctuations in visitor attendance ; and to the volatility of th e economy, which together directly affect the return on the endowment , short -term interest income, and donor giving, as well as restaurant, magazine, catalogue , and museum shop revenues, memberships, and other business activities. The Institution's gross o perating revenue, less the expenses of the auxiliary activities, represents the net operating revenue available for programmatic and related purposes. The following table summar izes the sources of trust operating funds.
