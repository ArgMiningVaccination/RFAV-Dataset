If you can, it's best to visit a board certified dermatologist for skin conditions like acne, psoriasis, and eczema, etc. This sandalwood essential oil by Eden Botanicals is steam distilled. |Oil Sandalwood Essential Oil](https://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-s-u/sandalwood-plantation-grown.html?correlationId=null) No matter what type of essential oil you decide you love best, try to choose one that isn't manufactured via a chemical process. Chemical distillation can dilute or contaminate the essential oil, reducing its efficacy and scent. Essential oils that are packaged in amber- or dark-colored glass bottles tend to last longer without becoming rancid. Don't purchase oils that are housed in plastic, as this may also alter the oil and its scent, or contaminate it. Check the ingredients on an essential oil bottle to make sure that it's pure and contains no additives. Only choose oils with labels indicating that the oil inside is 100 percent pure. Pick a product from a trusted manufacturer that's transparent about its sourcing and countries of origin. If an essential oil's label contains outrageous health claims, steer clear. If in doubt, check with the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm) Essential oils are very strong and should always be diluted before using topically. Diffuser ratio When using essential oils for aromatherapy, follow the instructions provided with your diffuser, since diffuser sizes vary. Typically, the ratio will be 3 to 5 drops of essential oil to 100 milliliters of water. Dilution rates For adults, 15 drops of essential oil to 6 or 7 teaspoons of carrier oil is a good ratio. For children, use less essential oil, around 3 to 5 drops to 6 teaspoons of carrier oil. You can always start with even fewer drops of essential oil. Patch test Before using an essential oil on your skin, it's important to do a patch test. This test allows you to see how your skin will react to a particular substance before using it more widely. To do a patch test, follow these steps: - Wash your forearm with mild, unscented soap. - Pat-dry your skin. - Apply a few drops of diluted essential oil onto a small patch of your forearm. - Put a bandage on the area, then wait 24 hours. If you experience any discomfort before the 24 hours are up, immediately wash the area with soap. After 24 hours, remove the bandage and look for signs of an adverse reaction. If you notice red, itchy, or blistering skin, you should discontinue use of the oil. Expiration dates Take note of the oil's expiration date before buying, and keep in mind that larger isn't always better. Essential oils expire and go rancid. Don't spend money on a quantity of oil that you can't use up by the expiration date. Storage To retain your oil's freshness for the longest period, store it in a cool, dark place. It isn't necessary to refrigerate essential oils, although the cold temperature will not hurt them. If you do wish to refrigerate the oil, enclose the bottle in an airtight bag so that the scent of the oil doesn't affect your food. Keep them out of reach of children and pets! Dilute, dilute, dilute Essential oils are safe but potent and can sometimes cause irritation or allergic reactions in some people. Don't use an essential oil that's sourced from an ingredient or botanical family that you're allergic to, and never put it directly on skin or hair, unless it's diluted with a carrier oil. Mix with an oil before adding to water Don't pour essential oils into bathwater, as they'll bead up and not blend with the water. Mix your essential oils of choice with a carrier oil first. Then combine it with bathwater. Don't consume them Never ingest an essential oil. Use with caution around pets Essential oils could potentially help to calm down pets in certain situations, but this isn't always the case. In some instances, essential oils may agitate dogs or cats, be harmful, or even fatal. Always check with your pet's veterinarian before using essential oil in a dwelling with pets. Essential oils should never be left anywhere a pet might get at them, as they can be poisonous if ingested. Remember that cats and dogs lick substances off their fur. Know that they're not always right for children [Some essential oils are safe for babies](/health/parenting/essential-oils-for-babies), but others may not be appropriate for use. Check with your child's pediatrician before using. Do I need a diffuser to use essential oils? Although [diffusers](/health/best-diffusers?utm_source=ReadNext) are one of the more popular choices, there are other [ways to use essential oils](/health/how-to-use-essential-oils). You can inhale your oil of choice directly from the bottle or apply it to some cotton and place it in your car's fan vent. If you have a humidifier, you can add a few drops of the oil into its tank. If you want to apply essential oil to your skin, remember to dilute the oil with a carrier oil first to avoid irritation or allergic reactions. It's also important that you never ingest essential oils. Can I put essential oils directly onto my skin? Before using essential oils on your skin, you must first dilute it with carrier oil (like almond oil or jojoba) \u2014 it's the safest method to apply essential oils topically. Remember, a patch test before using the oil on a larger area of your skin is always a great idea. This way, you are likely to avoid irritation or allergic reactions. Why do essential oils help the body and mind? Your sense of smell is powerful \u2014 a certain fragrance can stir up happy feelings and memories and not-so-great feelings. This isn't just anecdotal \u2014 there's science behind odor and our emotions. According to one [2013 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3794443/) Essential oils can provide a delightful scent or calming ambiance to your home. Some essential oils also have health benefits. Natural or organic oils that come from a trusted manufacturer are best. "}
