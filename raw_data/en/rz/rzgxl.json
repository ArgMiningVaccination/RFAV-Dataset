If we look at nature, it is the time of year for turning within, for retro-spection, and for conserving our energy. As we do turn inward, we are provided an opportunity to evaluate our-selves and our lives. Are we who we want to be? Are we living up to our potential? Are we fulfilling our dreams? And, if not, why not? Time moves faster, and it tumbles us along with it. Because we get caught up in our busy -ness, taking care of our families, and tending to the details, we miss out on caring for ourselves and seeing the bigger picture. Winter is traditionally a time to slow down, to nurture yourself, and to think about the seeds that lie dormant now and pa- tiently wait for spring to prod them into growing into their potential. Living a natural life is more than just eating organic and taking herbal supplements. So, pause. Take your own time. Breathe. Be grateful. Pay attention to the seasons. Feel them. Live as they compel you to take advantage of the gifts they offer. Find a nice warm mug of herbal tea. Sit down by the fire. Watch the flames dance in the dark. You can't, you say? You're too busy? Stop. Ask yourself this one question: Are you satisfied with the state of the world? If you don't stop, take stock of yourself, and make improvements, then how will those changes ever take place in the world around you and make it a better place? You hold the seeds for change. As you read through this edition of the NITE Light, find what speaks to you, enhance your strengths, and take steps in those areas that need improvement. Choose a self -care practice (even if you don't have that particular health condition!), and take time to incorporate it into your daily routine. Find a class topic that makes your heart zing with excitement, and come and learn. Or, find a class topic that you know nothing about, and come and broaden your horizon of knowledge. The tradition of making resolutions is right around the corner. For this new year ahead, I challenge you to make resolutions that enhance your ability to be the best you. And, commit to them, because you are worth it! Live in the present moment. Savor it now; do these things now. And remember, when you up your game and demand the best of yourself, the world around you will match that and become a better place, too. Let's celebrate that we have the power to put this into motion. We are grateful that you share our community of natural health. Blessings to you and your families this season and as we create a new year in 2018. Thank you! Amy Jo Amy Jo Howard, ND, CH LETTER FROM THE EDITOR HOLISTIC HEALTH FOR A HEALTHY IMMUNE SYSTEM by Lori Becker, NHP Everyone has had this experience, waiting in line at the grocery store or some other public place, and the person behind you is hacking and coughing. Clearly, they have some kind of creeping crud, cold, or flu type thing. And, you think to yourself, \"Oh great, now I am going to get it, or I hope I don't get it.\" We think this way, because we have been conditioned to believe that germs are the cause of disease. This is simply not true. Louis Pasteur (the father of Germ Theory of Disease) even admitted be- fore his death that this was not true. Antoine Bechamp believed that the cause of disease was absolutely NOT the invading virus or bacteria. He discov- ered that germs only led to illness when the immune sys- tem was suppressed. Viruses and bacteria will only flour- ish in an environment that is conducive to their growth. This means that we need to enhance the immune system naturally so that we create an environment NOT condu- cive to the growth of viruses and bacteria. But first, before we get into that, we need to understand that naturally, the body's first line of defense to viruses and bacteria is by the cellular part of the immune system having an inflammatory response. Then, the humoral \"learned\" part of the immune system kicks in and produces anti-inflammatory chemicals and anti - bodies that resolve the inflammation for healing to take place. This means that an inflammatory response (fever) is a sign that the immune system is working! The body raises its temperature to kill off bacteria and viruses. If we try to suppress this, the immune system is then hampered. Symptoms should not be viewed as a problem; we need to remember that symptoms are an outward sign of a struggle that the immune system is experiencing. So, let's not forget that acute illness is an opportunity for the immune system to develop strength and resistance. We live in a culture of fear. We try to eliminate all bacteria with anti -biotics, cleaners and soaps. We immediately try to stop symptoms as soon as they start. If symptoms are suppressed with synthetic medications, wastes and toxins can be sent more deeply into the body. This weakens the immune system even more. Anti-biotics severely compromise the immune system as they kill off the vitally good bacteria (not just the bad) that we need to maintain gut health as well as immune system health. Candida bacteria is actually anti -biotic resistant. So, by killing off the good guys, you just set your body up for re - occurring illness and imbalance. Now, the bad guys are free to take over and multiply (since you just killed off the guys that were keeping them in check). When we know better, we do better! Taking into consideration what I just explained, this does not mean that we \"do nothing\" when we get sick and just allow the body to work itself out. We have the ability to utilize God's and Nature's gifts during the time of illness to support, balance, and raise the vital force of the body to help along the natural process of how the body deals with acute disease. Yes, disease can be a natural process. Naturopathy means \"Natural Suffering,\" after all. Continued on the next page....

Cover photo and additional images by: openclipart.org This winter, use preventative medicine and a holistic life- style to build the immune system! Avoid and minimize exposure to immune system stressors: Poor nutrition: Refined sugar (suppresses the immune system), processed foods, genetically modified foods Overuse of alcohol and coffee Stress Inadequate sleep Sluggish digestion Diet and Lifestyle: Traditional Chinese Medicine teaches us to live in balance with the seasons. When we attain this harmony through diet and activities in the corresponding seasons, we are able to balance and support our immune system. Winter is associated with the kidneys. Kidneys hold our body's basic and fundamental energy. 3 4 Another important practice is to use a slant board or inver- sion table. An inversion table is a specially designed piece of equipment that secures you by your ankles and allows you to start inverting or tipping down so that your feet can be positioned higher than your head. If you use an inversion table, please make sure you are well se- cured, then start at a slight angle and gradually work your way up to a more prominent angle. To use a slant board, obtain a sturdy board (sometimes, an ironing board can work well) that will support your body weight. Position one end of the board higher than the other (prop it up on something sturdy that will not allow it to slide or move). Lie on the slant board with your feet at the high end and your head at the low end. Start with 3 -5 minutes, and gradually, work your way up to lying there at least 20 minutes every day. If possible, this is best done immedi- ately before getting into bed for the evening. The idea is that allowing the back to be supported and lying in the inverted position will help gravity to \"lift\" the tissues of the pelvis and bladder so that they are not sagging down and creating various health concerns. One more tip: CranioSacral therapy. This is a light touch bodywork therapy that works with the alignment of the spine and encourages the proper flow of cerebrospinal fluid to nourish the brain and all the nerves of the body. The nerves that feed into the spine in the lower back flow to the front of the body to nourish the bladder and other organs there. Tension or misalignments of the low back can then affect the bladder. So, no need for a plumber! There are many natural ways you can strengthen your bladder and improve your health, too. DRIP...DRIP...NEED A BLADDER PLUMBER? by Amy Jo Howard, ND, CH Loss of bladder control, or urinary incontinence, is a common concern for many women. Besides causing embarrassment, it can also affect the daily activities of your life. Incontinence affects 25 million adult Americans with 75 -80% of those affected being women. There are also different types of urinary incontinence, and the severity can range from occasional leaking to so sudden and strong you may not reach the bathroom in time. The different types of urinary incontinence include: Stress incontinence (urine leaks when pressure is exerted on the bladder from coughing, laughing, sneezing, exercising, etc.); Urge incontinence (sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by involuntary loss of urine); Overflow incontinence (frequent or constant dribbling of urine, because the bladder doesn't empty completely); Functional incontinence (a phys- ical or mental impairment prevents you from reaching the toilet in time); and Mixed incontinence (you can have more than one type). Although it does occur more frequently as people get older, urinary incontinence doesn't have to be a consequence of aging, and there are many natural remedies to consider no matter the type of incontinence or what age you may be. First of all, consider Uva Ursi. This is an herb that helps to strengthen and tone the bladder and urinary system. It has a long folk history of use for urinary infec- tions, kidney stones, cystitis, nephritis, bedwetting, and more. One of the con- stituents it contains is also known for its soothing and tissue repairing qualities. Next, start incorporating Kegel exercises into your daily rou- tine. Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles that support the bladder, uterus, rectum, and small intestine. To find the right muscles, stop your urine midstream. The muscles that you feel when doing this are the muscles you will want to target. Now that you know which muscles to exercise, do not do the exercises while urinating as this can decrease the bladder's ability to completely empty in the long term.

Healthy Immune System continued from page 2 5 6 NATURAL WOMAN: WOMEN'S HEALTH OPTIONS by Rachel Friesen, ND In today's world, women are dealing with a myriad of health concerns; issues such as PMS and other menstrual problems are commonplace. As women get older, many may face osteoporosis or sometimes, even cancer. Wom-en looking for alternative options turn to natural health for their solutions. In regard to women's health concerns, many of them can be boiled down to one big thing, hor-mones! Hormone balance is crucial to the proper function- ing of a woman's body, and even a minor disruption can cause a host of problems. In today's toxic chemical laden environment, women's bodies are exposed to xenoestro-gens and other hormone disrupting compounds which lead to many of these health concerns. One of the most common culprits for hormone imbalance is xenoestrogens. Xeno just means false, and estrogen is a female hormone. Xenoestrogens come in anything from pesticides in food to feminine care products laced with parabens. Pesticides contain chemicals known as organo- chlorines; these substances directly interfere with the hu- man endocrine system by disrupting normal hormone sig- naling. Feminine care products such as tampons and pads are used by most women, and the chemicals found on them are readily absorbed through the female organ sys-tem. These xenoestrogens contribute to estrogen domi-nance in women which can cause weight gain, PMS, and heavy menstruation to name a few. The good news is that there are great alternatives to these products such as Natracare feminine sani products. Also, there are reusable cloth pads from the company Party in My Pants that are made with cloth materials and come in many different decorative color options. However, the toxic stress of our environment doesn't end with xenoestrogens; another big component is radiation. A common health question for women is breast cancer screening. The standard screening is the mammogram. Mammograms use radiation which have carcinogenic properties and increase the risk for breast cancer, making it a counterintuitive option for regular screening. A good alternative to the mammogram screening is a thermo-gram. The thermogram is a type of screening device that charts heat distribution in each tissue. Because of its abil- ity to detect physiological changes, such as an increase of blood vessels or tissue growth, it can detect tumor related anomalies much sooner than even a mammogram screening. Also, this type of screening doesn't use radiation but an infrared thermal analysis making it a much safer option. So, next time you go in for a screening, consider getting a thermogram instead. Another health concern for women as they get older is bone porousness. This is brought about with age. As women's hormone productions decrease, mainly, the hormones associated with the parathyroid and the thyroid, some of these hormones relate to controlling blood calci- um levels. If these hormones are out of balance, it can cause an increased pull of calcium from the bone tissue resulting in osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a disease where the bones become porous and fragile and have a propen- sity to break. One of the best supplementations for the thyroid is the mineral iodine, and for the parathyroid, it is boron. If you have osteoporosis, supplementing these minerals in addi- tion to the normal recommendations of calcium and mag- nesium will be more beneficial. As a woman of modern day, it may be difficult to sift out the sound natural health options from the less health driv- en options that may be advertised. In this case, it may be helpful to schedule an appointment with a Naturopath, so that they can determine which hormones may be out of balance and make individualized recommendations on how to rebalance these hormones using natural substanc- es and lifestyle . *Coming in 2018 Are you prepared to rise to the call of soul growth?

The Three Significant Phases Of Humanity - Immersion Course: Taught In Three Four -Day Segments The Three Epochs (significant phases) of Humanity Per- maculture Design Course contains the creative and experi- ential application of living skills passed down by our ances- tors into the present time and beyond. The three areas of concentration are: 1) The Hunter -Gatherer Lifestyle; 2) Agricultural Settlement and Pastoralism (animals); 3) Appropriate Technology and the Ecological Epoch (Urban/Suburban). The Three Epochs course is designed to teach students to utilize what is available in the immediate landscape in a conscious and ecological manner. By learning from the ground up, they become immersed in living history where knowledge and hand skills come together in an integrated, healthy fashion. *Please Note: If the student takes all three four -day cours- es, they will receive a full Permaculture Design Certificate. Each four -day segment can also be taken separately, not leading to a Permaculture certificate. The Three Four -Day Segments are: Hunter -Gatherer: Permaculture as Seen Through the Eyes of the Hunter -Gatherer June 21 -24, 2018 $399 ($349 if paid by April 21, 2018) The hunter -gatherer (survival skills) relies on his ability to read the lay of the land and to gather what is needed. Food, fibers, building materials, water, etc., are gathered and utilized for sustenance, warmth, and pleasure. This segment of the course takes place completely outdoors. Course components include: Studying regional native traditions and life -ways Observing and reading the landscape Identifying basic necessities Fire, food, water, etc. 9 10 PERMACULTURE PRINCIPLES & DESIGN Even More \"Can't Miss\" Seminars for 2018! These programs will provide students with a deeper un-derstanding of land, plants, animals, springs, rivers, groundwater, and oceans. Care and love of the earth are at the core of our work ethic. The training utilizes the teachings of Bill Mollison's Permaculture Design System. The goal is to achieve a working understanding in ecologi- cally-based planning, site design, and management. Gain a basic understanding of design and development principles involved with large scale and small scale inten-sive Permaculture applications! Biodynamic Farming And Gardening: A Four -Day Course April 19 -22, 2018 $399 ($349 if paid by February 19, 2018) The Biodynamic practice of farming is something that is all encompassing and has to work to incorporate the whole universe, all the community of farmers, animals, and na- ture. Thus, all aspects of the farm and surrounding cos-mology are considered carefully in Biodynamic agriculture; eg. stars and moon phases as well as the breeds and spe- cies of plants. It treats soil fertility , plant growth, and live- stock care as ecologically interrelated tasks, emphasizing spiritual and mystical perspectives. Biodynamics has much in common with other organic ap- proaches - it emphasizes the use of manures and com- posts and excludes the use of artificial chemicals on soil and plants. Methods unique to the biodynamic approach include its treatment of animals, crops, and soil as a single system, an emphasis from its beginnings on local produc-tion and distribution systems, its use of traditional and de-velopment of new local breeds and varieties. Some meth- ods include: utilizing an astrological sowing and planting calendar and using various herbal and mineral compost Making traps, bows, and arrows; tracking and hunting Identifying, harvesting, and preparing wild edible plants Making fishing equipment; catching, cleaning and preparing fish for a meal Using local materials to construct a primitive village, paying attention to solar orientation, thermal mass, and insulation Managing the waste stream Discussing the invisible social structures of some tribes and tribal customs Discussing the origins of agriculture and pastoralism Agricultural Settlement, Pastoralism (animals), Natural Building Methods July 19 -22, 2018 $399 ($349 if paid by May 19, 2018) Course components include: Budgeting for the homestead Natural Building: Green structures, ecological building practices (Building codes included) Eco-building construction and home retrofit (includes building codes) Renewable energy (wind, solar, water, fire) systems and energy conservation Cooling, heating, air purification, and climate regulation Biological waste management systems and waste detoxification Nutrient Storage - food preservation (food storage) Creating a peaceful sanctuary Homestead maintenance and recycling Water collections systems: Purification, Storage, Distribution, and Cycling of Water Earthworks for water management Soils and Biological Diversity - fertility Small and Large Animal Husbandry and Cropping Permaculture Principles Forms of eco -gardening and farming (include Harvesting the Forests) Plants, trees, and their energy interactions Aquaculture and aquaponics Appropriate Technology and the Ecological Epoch: Urban/Suburban October 11 -14, 2018 $399 ($349 if paid by August 11, 2018) Course components include: Land use planning: Site suitability Small -scale bioregional site design -small intensive systems (include the application of specific methods, laws, and principles of design) Pattern understanding and observational skills Vegetation, land cover, and natural resource mapping Appropriate technology for urban -suburban sites: energy, tools, etc. Natural medicine Earthworks, water systems Clothing Recreation Noise abatement Settlement, village life -ways, and folkways Map building and modeling Infrastructure and roads Food Forests and Forest Gardening Communications, emergency preparations and procedures Wayne Weiseman is a teacher, designer, consultant and author.

Have you ever tried to change a thought or behavior - you put a lot of work in, you change the way you do things, you create new habits, you try to be conscious of your thoughts, you say your affirmations - and nothing. The goal that you worked so hard to achieve is as elusive as ever. How frustrating is that?! And then, you feel like something must be wrong with you, because you did all the work, and nothing happened. Do you know what I'm talking about? Well, finally, we have some answers! New research indi- cates that our subconscious minds manage about 90 per- cent of everything we do whether we're asleep or awake. In fact, the conscious mind plays only a minor role in di- recting our lives. Most of what we think, say, and do every day is a function of the subconscious brain. A lot of us have been conditioned to view the subcon- scious mind as something that tries to sabotage us. It actually works more like a well -meaning friend who just hasn't been apprised of the latest developments in your life. That friend is using old information to try and inter-vene in situations in which they think they know what's best for you. Imagine a sweet neighbor who gets you a sparkly sweater every year, because she just loves hers, so she thinks that you would naturally love one, too. Well, when we look at the subconscious mind, we learn that it stores all of our beliefs, perceptions, and values that are generated from past experiences and are formed as a result of several factors. Similar to the operating software in a computer, our basic psychological predispositions are the result of software handed down from our parents that is then reinforced by cultural conditioning and childhood experiences. From this, the subconscious creates \"perceptual filters\" through which we respond to life's chal- lenges. These filters form the basis for our actions and reactions to new situations in our lives; they determine our choices and direct our behaviors. Let's take a look at the major differences between the con- scious and the subconscious mind. The conscious mind: sets goals and judges results; thinks abstractly; is past and future focused in relation to time; operates in short term memory; and has a limited processing capacity big three are sight, hearing, and touch. We use all of our senses, yet most of us have a dominant sense through which we experience the world; this comes into play most often in recognizing one's learning style. Let's say that you are visually dominant. You tend to create pictures in your mind when remembering or learning things; you learn best by seeing words or demonstrations. Sometimes, the subconscious will create a belief around an experience that occurred using one of your non -dominant senses. So, if you are trying to change that belief, and you are us- ing visualization in an effort to make that change, the sub- conscious may not recognize your efforts, because it actu- ally created that belief in relation to an auditory or kines- thetic experience! The most exciting thing is that we have a way in which we can communicate with the subconscious mind, update that old computer software, and finally, change limiting beliefs so that we can be who we really want to be! It is so excit- ing that I am going to give it another exclamation point!! The process is called PSYCH -K\u00ae, and it's based on whole -brain integration processes that utilize the knowledge of how to effectively communicate personal goals with the subconscious mind. It is, indeed, an effective way to change outdated subconscious perceptions and beliefs that may be limiting you and your achievements. What would life be like if you were more clear thinking, creative, healthy, and happy? You have the potential to be; you just have to free yourself and open to the possibili- ties! If there are goals that you have strived to achieve and still don't feel like you've made the progress that you want, then this can help you. Once we change our sub- conscious, psychological filters, we can change the way we perceive ourselves and the world in which we live. We can literally create a new reality for ourselves. What do you think?! YOU BECOME WHAT YOU THINK by Amy Jo Howard, ND, CH (40 bits of information per second). The subconscious mind: is habitual and monitors the motor functions of the body; thinks literally; is timeless, focusing on the present moment; operates in long term memory; and has an ex-panded processing capacity (40 MILLION bits of infor- mation per second). As you can see, the subconscious mind plays a very im- portant part in our lives and presents a major opportunity for changing old habits of thinking and behaving. For ex- ample, using the computer analogy, the conscious mind is like a 40 bit processor, and the subconscious mind is like a 40 million bit processor. So, if the conscious mind de- sires a goal that the subconscious mind disagrees with, guess which one wins? You could also look at it like a computer hard drive running outdated programs. Using willpower is just trying to get different results using the same outdated programs. That is why willpower, affirma- tions, and even counseling sometimes fail to help us achieve lasting change. Those techniques use this equa-tion: Insight + Willpower = Change. Yet, how often have you gained countless insights, put in major amounts of effort, and seen little or no change? Like we said, this is disappointing and frustrating. However, if you learn how to communicate with the sub-conscious in a user -friendly way it understands, then you can update its information. One key for communication is to remember that the con- scious mind thinks abstractly, and the subconscious mind thinks literally. Let's say that you have a goal of being happy. Without more information or clarification, the sub- conscious mind doesn't understand what this entails. It's like planning to go on a vacation with a friend, and the only information you give them is that you're going some- where fun. You pack for the beach and somewhere tropi- cal, and they pack for a winter ski getaway! Therefore, when you set goals, you need to be literal and specific; otherwise, if the subconscious thinks it has made even one small step toward your (abstract) goal, then it stops working toward it. Another key is that the subconscious mind knows things only through the five senses; so, information needs to be translated into a sensory based language. While the five senses include smell, taste, sight, hearing, and touch, the HEALTHY EATING CLASSES New classes will start in May 2018! Watch for our new schedule!

Words can have a profound effect on people. Hearing one simple word or phrase can change a person's life in an instant. There aren't many words that strike fear deep into the heart like the word Cancer. Oftentimes, this state of disease can feel like a death sentence with no way out. We get stuck into this state of fear, unable to think clearly with so many thoughts rushing through our heads. \"How long do I have?\" \"What will happen to my family?\" Often, this is accompanied with a feeling of hopelessness. How- ever, this doesn't have to be a death sentence. There are many natural methods of helping the body to heal from this dis-ease state and to help bring the body back into a state of balance. Just like all of the other cells, tissues, and organs in our bodies, cancer cells need a food source which for the mu-tated cells is glucose. Our bodies run off of 3 sources of fuel: carbohydrates, proteins, and fat. The first forms of fuel that we typically run to after a long day are the carbo-hydrates. These provide a quick burst of energy for the body, but unfortunately, this fuel source burns out quickly. This gives us the \"crash\" feeling and leaves us craving more carbs for that continued energy. The next fuel source that our bodies tend to crave is protein. This vital part of our nutrition is great for building muscles but often, inhibits the body from being able to lose the fat. The last and most efficient fuel source for our bodies is fat. This ketone fuel source will last the longest and is the most efficient form for our bodies to utilize, however it is pretty difficult to get our bodies into a state of ketosis. This state where we are using fat as fuel is called ketosis. During the digestive process, approximately 10% of the fat, 50% of the proteins, and 100% of the carbohydrates that we consume are broken down into glucose. For many years, it was believed that glucose was the only source of fuel for the brain. Newly researched science has shown that that is not true; the brain thrives on ketones as a fuel source! Ketone bodies occur naturally when our livers have used up the stored glucose, and we are using fat as the primary fuel source. Not only are ketones fantastic for the brain and for fat loss, but they give more mental clari- ty, energy, and reduce inflammation as well as many more benefits. When we are using the ketones in our body, we are in a state of ketosis. When the body is in a state of ketosis, the metabolic path-ways for fuel source in our bodies changes from running off of glucose to running off ketones. By changing this metabolic pathway, cancer cells literally starve to death, which inhibits their ability to replicate. A driving factor in cancer's ability to spread is replication. Research has shown that glucose is the preferred food source for cancer cells. By switching the metabolic pathway from glucose to ketones, the ability for the mutated cells to replicate is diminished and leads to a \"starvation\" of the cancer cells. There are two ways for the body to get into a state of ke- tosis. The first is by eating a ketogenic diet. This forces the body to use an endogenous source of ketones that are produced naturally within the body. Another way is by supplementing with exogenous ketones that are obtained from outside of the body. Now, how do we get into a state of ketosis quickly when dealing with a serious condition such as cancer? By supplementing with exogenous ke-tones (those naturally derived from a food source, not oc- curring in the body), we are able to jumpstart our bodies into running on a ketone pathway. This does not interfere with our bodies' natural ability to get into a state of ketosis, rather it gives it a boost to help us achieve ketosis quickly. A company called Pruvit makes one of the best supplements of exogenous ke-tones. These powdered drink mixes can be added into water to help get the body into a ketogenic state quickly, thus using ketones in our own body fat as fuel rather than glucose and providing an energy source that the body can sustain. Being in a state of ketosis causes the body to shift into a fat burning mode, a less efficient source of fuel for cancer. One can be even more effective at staying in a ketogenic state by following a ketogenic diet and supplementing with exogenous ketones. This diet aims to limit the amount of carbohydrates that a person would eat and avoiding all forms of sugar, even fruits and starchy vegetables. A ketogenic diet has a moderate to high fat content, that when combined with the Pruvit's exogenous ketones, provides a constant fat for fuel. Sometimes, getting healthy fats into the diet can be rather tricky; however, there are some great \"fat bomb\" recipes that are delicious and convenient sources of fat. There are many benefits to being in a state of ketosis. Pruvits exogenous ketones have been proven to provide these benefits: better sleep, mood, and digestion, clear skin, strength gain and muscle preservation, fat loss and appetite suppression, quick and sus- tained energy, increased focus and decreased brain fog. Dr. Angela Poff is one of the many doctors studying the amazing effects on the body by following the ketogenic diet and by sup- plementing with exogenous ketones. She has several videos on YouTube that explain the findings of her re- search. By switching the metabolic pathways within our bodies and using a more efficient source of fuel, we will have more energy to do the things we love in life, thus creating a happier environment to be enjoyed by those around us! 13 14 STARVING CANCER OUT! by Denise Denman, NHP FAT IS THE BOMB !
