China. modifying gut barrier and microbiota homeostasis , affect the progression of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Here we aim to compare modulatory effects of inulin -type fructans (ITF s), natural soluble dietary fiber s with different degrees of fermentability from chicory root, on T1D development in non-obese diabetic ( NOD ) mice. Methods and results: Female NOD mice were weaned to long and short chain ITFs [ITF(l) and ITF(s), 5%] supplemented diet up to 24 weeks. T1D incidence, pancreatic -gut immune responses, gut barrier function and microbiota composition were analyzed. ITF(l) but not ITF(s) supplementation dampened the incidence of T1D. ITF(l) promot ed modulatory T cell responses , by increased CD25+Foxp3+CD4+ Treg cells, decreased IL17A+CD4+ Th17 cells and modulated cytokine production profile in the pancreas, spleen and colon . Furthermore, ITF(l) suppressed NLRP 3-caspase -1-p20-IL-1 inflamma some in the colon . Expression of b arrier reinforcing tight junction proteins occludin claudin -2, antimicrobial s -defensin -1 and production were by ITF(l). Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed that ITF(l) enhanc ed an anti-diabetogenic balance and enriched modulatory Ruminococcaceae and Lactobacill i. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that ITF(l) but not ITF(s) delay s the development of T1D via modulation of gut -pancreatic immunity, barrier function and microbiota homeostasis. www.mnf -journal.com Page 3 Molecular Nutrition & Food Research This article is protected by copyright.

Diet affecting i ntestinal immunity, barrier function and gut microbiota is a critical modulator in the pathogenesis of -cell autoimmunity and T1D [1]. Dietary fibers may be fermented by the gut microbiota to produce health -promoting s hort chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and modify intestinal barrier function and microbiota homeosta sis. Therefore, consumption of dietary fibers represents an effective strategy to modulate the development of T1D. In general, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with reduced incidence of immunological diseases [2] but in NOD mice, it has been shown that some complex dietary fibers enhance autoimmunity against -cells by conditioning microbiota and by disruption of gut barrier and immune function [3, 4] . We have hypothesized that this might be related to the chemistry of the consumed fibers as we and others have shown that not all but only specific types of dietary fibers are immunomodulat ing or improving the intestinal barrier function [5, 6]. However, whether this holds consequences for possible prevention of diabetes and effects on gut homeostasis has to the best of our knowledge not been studied yet. www.mnf -journal.com Page 6 Molecular Nutrition & Food Research This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. 6 A family of dietary fibers for which clear chemistry -dependent effects are demonstrated are inulin -type fructans (ITFs) [7]. Previous studies have demonstrated that the degree of polymerization (DP, i.e. chain length) of ITFs determines the immunological effects on human immune cells [5, 8] and its impact on gut epithelial cell barrier function [9]. The chemistry -dependent effects were determined by the magnitude by which ITFs can activate toll-like receptor (TLR)2 which was stronger with long chain (high -DP) inulins than with short chain inulins. In addition, ITFs have different effects on the gut microbiota as long -chains are predominantly fermented in the colon while short chains are already fermented in the small intestine [6, 10] . Dietary fibers may influence the diabetogenic process via effects on gut immunity, barrier and microbiota that modulate T cells involved in autoimmunity [11, 12] . T helper (Th)1 cells that secrete interferon - (INF -) can activate autoreactive CD8+ T cells. Additionally, IL-17-producing CD4+ T helper (Th17) cells are pathogenic during autoimmune diabetes [13]. Some gut microbiota can support generation of Foxp3+ CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells and correct the imbalance between Treg and Th17 cells and closely related autoreactive T cells [11, 12]. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that dietary fibers that beneficially influence the gut microbiota involved in maintaining T cell balances mig ht be instrumental in slowing down or preventing progression of autoimmune diabetes. Here we compared the effects of long chain ITF(l) and the more readily fermentable short chain ITF(s) on the frequency of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice. In the mice we s tudied insulitis and the frequency of Treg and Th17 cells in the pancreas, spleen and colon as well as their functions by quantifying production of IL -10, IL -1 and IL -17. Nucleotide -binding oligomerization and pyrin 3 recently implicated in the pathogenesis of T1D [14] were also examined. Additionally, we studied colon integrity as a possible mechanism by which ITF(l) influence immunity by www.mnf -journal.com Page 7 Molecular Nutrition & Food Research This article is protected by copyright.

Finally, in ITF(l) we studied changes to the microbiota derived metabolites short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and modification of gut microbiota composition with relation to T1D [17, 18] . Materials and m ethods Fibers and structural characterization The applied short and long chain ITFs: ITF(s) (Frutalose OFP, 2 < , 10 < DP < 60) extracted from chicory roots were provided by Sensus B.V. ( Roosendaal, The Netherlands ). Their specific chain length profiles (range and distribution) were characterized by high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) as previously described [5]. Animals Female NOD/LtJ mice were purchased from S u Pu Si Biotechnology Co., LTD (Suzhou, Jiangsu, China ) and maintained in specific pathogen -free environment at the Animal Housing Unit of Jiangnan University ( Jiangsu, China) under a controlled temperature (23-25\u00b0C) and a 12 -h light/12 -h dark cycle. All experimental protocols wer e approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Com mittee of Jiangnan University (JN.No 20150331 -0410 ) and carried out in compliance with national and international guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . Three -week -old female NOD mice were fed with AIN -93G control diet [19] or diet supplemented with 5% (wt/wt) ITF(l) or ITF(s) until 24 weeks. Before the blood glucose test, mice were fasted for 6 h and blood glucose levels were determined with an Accu -chek glucosemeter (Roche Diagnostics, Almere, The Netherlands). Overt diabetes was confirmed by a glycemia > 13.3 mmol /L in two consecutive days. ELISA assays Serum was collected by allowing the blood to co agulate at ambient temperate for 25 min, and subsequently cen trifuging the samples at 3,000 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.

Diethyl ether (1ml) was added to the samples to extract SCFAs. Samples were then centrifuged at 14 .000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C and supernatants were used for analysis. We used paramete rs of GC -MS as previous ly described [20]. Next -generation sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq system. For each genomic DNA sample, the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene (250 bp) was amplified by using Kapa HiFi PCR kit (Kapa Biosystems Applied Biosystems\u00ae 2720 Thermal Cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA). The quality of libraries was confirmed by using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, MA, USA) and the dataset was analyzed by Trimmomatic V0.30. Flow cytometry After 24 -week treatment, mice were sacrificed and immune cell population s were studied in pancreas, spleen and colon . Antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen (California, USA ) and d etailed information is listed in Table S1 . Pancreas, colon and spleen samples were harvested and cut into small pieces then digested in 1.4 mg/mL collagenase -P (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Pancreas and colon samples were digested at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. Digested organ tissues were filtered through 7 5 m polypropylene mesh with syringe plunger. Then red blood cells in single cell suspensions were lysed by Red Blood Cell Lysis Kit (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Single cell suspensions w ere stained for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C in PBS with the following mAbs: anti-CD4 and -CD25 .

Incidences between each group were compared with the log -rank test. Statistical analysis between two groups was performed by independent t-test, or when multiple comparisons were made, by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post -hoc test using GraphPad Prism (v 5; GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). P <0.05 were considered as a statistically significant difference. Results Long chain but not short chain inulin is protective against the de velopment of autoimmune diabetes We first characterized the chemical composition of two ITF formulations using HPAEC. Figure 1A describe s the oligosaccharide range and relative response per oligomer of the ITFs. ITF(s) and ITF( l) have very different profiles with only a partial overlap (Figure 1A). ITF(s) consist of fructooligosaccharide (FOS) with mostly chain lengths of 2 < DP < 10, while ITF(l) may be described as inulin due to their broad range of chain lengths up to DP60. I TF(s) contain mostly chain types of GF3, GF4, and GF5 (i.e. starting with a glucose molecule followed by 3, 4, or 5 fructose subunits) and F3, F4, or F5 (chains consisting only of 3, 4, or 5 fructose moieties). ITF(s) consists of both GFn and ITF(l) consists fructose monomers, glucose and subunits and trimers made up of one glucose subunit and two fructose subunits) are present in both ITFs. The effects of long and short chain ITF on diabetogenesis were then examined over a period of 24 weeks. ITF(l) prevented the development of autoimmune diabetes as diabetes incidences were only 10% in ITF(1) treated animals (P < 0.01 ) and 40% in ITF(s) treated animals (Figure 1B). Accordingly, lower frequencies and reduced severity of insulitis were www.mnf -journal.com Page 12 Molecular Nutrition & Food Research This article is protected by copyright.

Long chain ITF modulates pan creatic and systemic Treg and Th17 response s Next we examined and compared ITF(1) and ITF(s) supplementation on cellular immune responses in the pancreas and quantified T regulator y cells and Th17 cells ( Figure 2 A). ITF(l) fed mice had increased Treg cells and decreased Th17 cells in the pancreas. Also, we quantified levels of IL-10, IL -1 and IL -17 in the pancreas . ITF(l) significantly enhanced the production of the regulatory cytokine IL -10 (P < 0.0219) and decreased the production of proinflammatory IL-17 (P < 0.0129 ) and IL-1 (P < 0.0085) when compared to the control animals (Figure 2 B). Similar modulatory effects of ITF(l) were found in the spleen and serum . Treg in the spleen was enhanced ( P < 0.0184), while Th17 was reduced ( P < 0.0211) in ITF(l) fed NOD mice compared to the control anim als. The pro -inflammatory mediators IL -17 (P < 0.0005 ) and IL -1 (P < 0.0064 ) were decreased in the serum by ITF(l) (Figure 3A), although a significant change in systemic IL-10 was not observed ( Figure 3B). Long chain ITF(l) modulates colonic T and modulatory cytokine release As ITF(l) are fermented in the colon [21] and influence immunity by either direct interaction with intestinal cells [22] or by modulating the immune active fermentation products of microbiota [21], we next studied the colonic immunit y, colonic integrity, microbiota and their short -chain fatty acids fermentation products in ITF(l) -treated animals with reduced diabetes frequency. In the colon, we observed that ITF(l) supplementation enhanced Treg cell and downregulated Th17 cells compa red with control NOD mice (Figure 4A). In addition, ITF(l) www.mnf -journal.com Page 13 Molecular Nutrition & Food Research This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. 13 fed NOD mice had higher colonic levels of IL -10 (P < 0.0130 ), but lower levels of IL-1 (P < and IL17 (P < 0.0115 ) (Figure 4B). Reduction in IL-1 production in the colon was at least in part caused by suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome and expression (Figure We also examined mitogen -activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and nuclear factor (NF)B p65 phosphorylation and activation in the colon to determine whether the reduction in inflammation was through suppression of these pathway s. However, there were no distinction in p -p38 and p -p65 expression between the NOD control and ITF(l) fed groups (Figure S1). ITF( l) improve s gut integrity and barrier function A healthier colon with a longer length , thicker colon mucosa and deeper crypt s were observed in ITF(l) fed NOD mice compared to control s (Figure 5A and B ). The e nhanced colon integrity in ITF(l) fed mice was further substantiated by higher levels of the TJ protein s occludin and claudin -2 (Figure 5C ) but not of ZO-2 (Figure S2). In addition, ITF(l) enhanced the expression antimicrobial peptide s -defensin -1 and CRAMP , important in the defense against pathogens and for maintaining the gut barrier function (Figure 5D ). ITF(l) promotes SCFA production and modifies gut microbiota composition Shifts in gut microbiota and SCFA production have been associated with development of autoimmune diabetes [17]. Consequently , we studied the effect of ITFs on SCFA production and gut microbiota composition . The data showed that ITF(l) increased acetate, propionate and butyrate production compared to the control group (Figure 6A). Notably by 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis , ITF(l) rich diets indeed modified gut microbiota and increas ed the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes at the phylum level in NOD mice (Figure 6 B). Further analysis demonstrated that ITF(l) modifie d lineages of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes microbiota at the family and genus levels (Table 2). The mucin -degrading Ruminococcaceae www.mnf -journal.com Page 14 Molecular Nutrition & Food Research This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. 14 [3] and Lactobaccilli with profound anti -inflammatory properties [23] were significantly more abundant in ITF(l) fed mice . ITF(l) supplementation altered gut microbiota composition with a much greater and diversity in the bacterial community of ITF( l) fed group compared with normal chow fed mice (Figure 6 C and D ). Discussion Our study demonstrates that dietary supplementation with ITF(l) but not ITF(s) dampens the incidence of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice . In ITF(l) -fed NOD mice, we observed protection from insulitis and absence of infiltration of immune cells. ITF( l) promotes modulatory pancreatic and systemic T cell responses as illustrated by increased Treg/Th17 ratio and modulatory cytokine production. Furthermore, ITF(l) improves intestinal immune homeostasis and barrier integrity by selective regulation of TJ p roteins and the antimicrobial peptide -defensin -1. Lastly, ITF(l) -fed mice show enhanced SCFA production as well as a more diverse and balanced gut microbiome . The finding that ITF(l) but not ITF(s) dampens the incidence of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mic e leads to the postulation that only specific dietary fibers promote immunity and intestinal homeostasis in autoimmune prone NOD mice . This finding does not seem to corroborate earlier findings of Toivonen et al [3] that fermentable dietary fibers promote the developmen t of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice. Notably , however, fibers with totally different structures than that of ITF s were used. In addition, it is suggested that T1D promoting or modulating effects of dietary fibers are related to their influence on Firmicutes which are associated with Treg generation. Here we support this by showing that long -chain ITF(1) enhance s the abundance of Firmicutes which may be one of the mech anisms by which this dietary fiber ameliorate s diabetes in NOD mice [24]. www.mnf -journal.com Page 15 Molecular Nutrition & Food Research This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. 15 Previously, differential prebiotic and immunomodulatory effects have been demonstrated by ITFs of varying chain length. Prolonged fermentation of long chain inulin (DP > 10) compared with short chain inulin (DP < 10) ensure s more endurable and profound prebiotic and immunomodulatory effect s, locally on the colon and systemically, which are largely determined by the fermenting microbiota [25]. Here in NOD mice, we first report that dietary supplementation with ITF dampens the incidence of autoimm une diabetes in a fiber -chemistry dependent fashion . The protective effects by long chain ITF is found to be associated with modification of gut microbiota composition, strengthening of intestinal mucosal barrier integrity and resultant modulatory pancreatic and systemic immune responses . As such enrichment of the diet with these type s of dietary fibers may reduce or slow down the progress of autoimmune destruction of -cells. CD4+ Foxp3+ Treg cells are responsible for self-tolerance and immune homeostasis [26]. Foxp3+ Treg and Th17 cells/IL-17 indispensable in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes [13] are dysregulated. With the observations that ITF(l) increases Treg and decreases Th17 cell frequencies in pancreas, spleen, and colon, accompa nied by a regulatory cytokine milieu, we confirm that ITF(l) promotes a modulatory pancreatic and systemic regulatory T cell response s. Reinforced immunomodulatory effect s of ITF(l) in the colon may be transmittable to the pancreas [28]. The development of T1D i s thought to have an intestinal origin [1, 29] . Alterations in intestinal permeability and structure have been reported in human subjects either preceding T1D onset or concomitant with the disease [30]. Dietary intervention by hydrolyzed casein to restore impaired intestinal barrier function modulates the development of -cell autoimmunity and decreases the risk of T1D in humans and in Biobreeding diabetes -prone rat model [1, 31] .

In our study, ITF(l) the TJs claudin -1 and occludin . Differential regulation o f TJ proteins has been observed after dietary interventions [33]. Fermentable fibers such as ITF(l) may be consumed by colonic microbiota and transformed into SCFAs including butyrate that influence barrier function [34] and maintain gut immunological homeostasis [35]. Reduced butyrate production has been associated with the development of autoimmune diabetes [36]. Butyrate produced in the intestine induces differentiation of colonic T reg cells [24] and also enhance s systemic Treg cell generation. Butyrate also exerts anti -inflammatory and especially that of butyrate as we observed may have been a causative factor in the enhanced TJ expression and beneficial immunomodulatory effects in the NOD mice . Composition of the gut microbiome and the abundance of certain bacteria are important factors to influence the progress of T1D in NOD mice [38]. Our microbiome analysis demonstrate d that ITF(l) modulate the composi tion and increased diversity of microbiota. In particular, ITF(l) increased Firmicutes and decreased Bacteroidetes at phylum level and enriched modulatory Ruminococcaceae and Lactobacilli . Earlier studies have shown promote the development of T1D [17, 39] . Dietary interventions that accelerated T1D decreased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio [40, 41]. Prediabetic children harbor more bacteriodetes compared to the healthy children [42]. ITF(l)-induced decrease in Bacteroidetes can therefore exert additional anti-diabetogen ic effect of ITF(l). Lactobacilli is one of potential probiotic members that alleviate inflammation as demonstrated after co -culturing dendritic cells with species of lactobacilli with formation of Treg cells as a consequence [23]. Many bacteria including Lactobacilli have been identified to have effects on gut barrier function [43-45]. Modulated microbiome www.mnf -journal.com Page 17 Molecular Nutrition & Food Research This article is protected by copyright.

An unbalan ced mucosal immunity is a major contributor to the failure to form tolerance, resulting in the autoimmunity in T1D [29]. In conclusion, w e show that modulation of the autoimmune process with dietary fibers in a feasible option but at the same time our data warrant selection of specific immune modulatory and colon acting fibers. Our findings emphasize the role of intestinal homeostasis in the modulation of T1D, supporting the hypothesis that strengthening gut barrier may be a promising target to hinder the development of T1D. As for cellular molecular changes in NOD mice that connect diet to gut and immune homeostasis, this work may herald promising dietary approach es with the ITF(l) prebiotic to prevent or slow down progression of autoimmune diabetes . mnfr201601006 -sup-0001 -Supp -Infor.pptx Acknowledgements The present work was supported by the Dutch Diabetes Foundation and by funds from National Natural Science Foundation of China ( grant nos. 31400779, 31570915 and 91642114 ), Jiangsu Province Recruitment Plan for High -level, Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talents and Key Program of Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (grant no.
