When Can I Apply? Application to Enroll or Change Coverage The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2 010 (PPACA) specifies that an eligible person must enroll for coverage or change plans during the Annual Open Enr ollment Period. Persons who fail to enroll or chang e plans during the Annual Open Enrollment Period must wait until t he next Annual Open Enrollment Period to enroll in a plan or to change plans. However, if a person experiences a tr iggering event as described below, the triggering e vent starts a 60-day special enrollment period during which an el igible person can enroll and an Insured Person can add dependents and change coverage. The Annual Open Enrollment Period and special enrol lment period are explained below. Annual Open Enrollment Period The Annual Open Enrollment Period is a specified pe riod of time, specified under federal and Colorado law, each Year during which Individuals who are eligible as descri bed above can apply to enroll for coverage or chang e coverage from one plan to another. To be enrolled for coverage under this Policy. You must submit a completed and signed application for coverage under this Policy for Yourself and any eligible dependent s, and We must receive that application during the Annual Open Enrollment Period. Your coverage under this Policy will then become ef fective upon the earliest day allowable under feder al rules for that Year's Annual Open Enrollment Period. Note: If You do not apply to obtain or change cover age during the Annual Open Enrollment Period, You will not be able to app ly again until the following Year's Annual Open Enr ollment Period unless You qualify for a special enrollment period as described below. Colorado Annual Market Stabilization Special Enroll ment Period The annual market stabilization special enrollment period begins each year on December 16th and extend s through January 15th. Individual health benefit plans purc hased during the annual market stabilization specia l enrollment period are to be effective no later than February 1 st. This is to ensure that individuals have suffi cient opportunity to enroll in a health benefit plan after the end of th e annual open enrollment period and to ensure the c ontinued health and stability of the Colorado health insurance mark et. The special enrollment period eligibility verificat ion and prior coverage requirements do not apply to the annual ma rket stabilization special enrollment period. Special Enrollment Periods A special enrollment period occurs when a person ex periences a triggering event. When You are notified or become aware of a triggeri ng event that will occur in the future, you may app ly for enrollment in a new health benefit plan during the sixty (60) cal endar days prior to the effective date of the trigg ering event, with coverage beginning no earlier than the day the trig gering event occurs to avoid a gap in coverage.

Deductibles apply to all Covered Expenses a s described in the Definitions section of this Poli cy, unless expressly stated otherwise in the benefit schedule. Deductibl es do not include any amounts in excess of Allowed Expense, any penalties, or expenses incurred in addition to Cove red Expenses.

T he Deductible is the amount of Covered Expenses you must pay for any Covered Services (except as specifically stated oth erwise in the benefit schedule) incurred from Participating Providers each Year before this Policy will pay you r claims. There are two ways an Insured Person can meet his or her Deductible: When an Insured Person meets his or her Individual Deductible, that Insured Person's benefits will be paid accordingly, whether any applicable Family Deductib le is satisfied or not. If one or more Family Members are enrolled for cov erage under this Policy, the Family Deductible will apply. Each Insured Person can contribute up to the individual Deductible amount toward the Family Deductible.

Once the Individual Out -of- Pocket Maximum has been met for the Year, for In-Ne twork Covered Services, You will no longer have to pay any Coinsurance or Copayment for medical or pharmac y services for Covered Expenses incurred In-Network during the remainder of that Year. Non-compliance p enalty charges do not apply to the Individual Out-o f-Pocket Maximum and will always be paid by You.

The Family Out-of-Pocket Maximum applies if You ha ve a family plan and You and one or more of your Fa mily Member(s) are enrolled for coverage under this Poli cy. It is an accumulation of the Individual Covered Expenses, including Deductibles, Copayments and Coinsurance f or medical and Prescription Drug Covered Services, paid by each Family Member for Covered Expenses during a Year. If You cover other Family Member(s), each In sured Person's Covered Services accumulate toward the Fam ily Out-of-Pocket Maximum. Each Insured Person can contribute up to the Individual Out-of-Pocket amoun t toward the Family Out-of-Pocket Maximum. Once the Out- of-Pocket Maximum for In-Network Covered Services h as been met, the Family Members will no longer have to pay any Deductible, Coinsurance or Copayments for C overed Expenses incurred In-Network during the remainder of that Year.

Recovery may be by settlement, judgment or otherwise. The lien will be in the amount of benefits paid by Us under this Policy for the treatment of the Illness, disea se, Injury or condition for which the third party is liable. We will be entitled to collect on our lien even if the amount recovered by or for the Insured Person (or his or her estate, parent or legal guard ian) from or for the account of such third party as compensation for the Injury, Illness or condition is less than the actua l loss suffered by the Insured Person.

Governmental benefits as permitted by law, except for Medicaid, Medicare and Medicare supplement poli cies. Medical benefits coverage under any form of group or individual automobile insurance. Each plan or part of a plan which has the right to coordinate benefits will be considered a separate p lan. Primary Plan The plan that pays first as determined by the Order of Benefit Determination Rules below. Secondary Plan The plan that pays after the Primary Plan as determ ined by the Order of Benefit Determination Rules be low. The benefits under the Secondary Plan are reduced based on the benefits under the Primary Plan. Allowable Expense The portion of a Covered Expense used in determinin g the benefits this plan pays when it is the Second ary Plan. The Allowable Expense is the lesser of: the charge used by the Primary Plan in determining the benefits it pays; the charge that would be used by this plan in dete rmining the benefits it would pay if it were the Pr imary Plan, and the amount of the Covered Expense. If the benefits for a Covered Expense under Your Pr imary Plan are reduced because You did not comply w ith the Primary Plan's requirements (for example, getting p re-certification of Hospital admission or a second surgical opinion), the amount of the Allowable Expense is reduced by t he amount of the reduction. Claim Determination Period A Calendar Year, but does not include any part of a year during which you are not covered under this p lan or any date before this section or any similar provision takes effect. Order of Benefit Determination Rules A plan that does not have a coordination of benefit s rule consistent with this section shall always be the Primary Plan. If the plan does have a coordination of benefits rule consistent with this section, the first of the foll owing rules that applies to the situation is the one that applies: The plan that covers you as an enrollee or an empl oyee shall be the Primary Plan and the plan that co vers you as a dependent shall be the Secondary Plan; If you are a dependent child whose parents are not divorced or legally separated, the Primary Plan sh all be the plan which covers the parent whose birthday falls first in the Calendar Year as an enrollee or employee; COINDEPO052021 Cigna Connect Flex Silver 4500 Rx Co pay (200-250% FPL) MIEP0482 71 If you are the dependent of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the dependent shall be determ ined in the following order: o first, if a court decree states that one parent is responsible for the child's healthcare expenses or health coverage and the plan for that parent has actual kn owledge of the terms of the order, but only from th e time of actual knowledge; o then, the plan of the parent with custody of the c hild; o then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with cu stody of the child; o then, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child; and o finally, the plan of the spouse of the parent not having custody of the child. The plan that covers you as an active employee (or as that employee's dependent) shall be the Primary Plan and the plan that covers you as a laid-off or retired e mployee (or as that employee's dependent) shall be the Secondary Plan. If the other plan does not have a similar pro vision and, as a result, the plans cannot agree on the order of benefit determination, this paragraph shall not app ly. The plan that covers you under a right of continua tion which is provided by federal or state law shal l be the Secondary Plan and the plan that covers you as an a ctive employee or retiree (or as that employee's de pendent) shall be the Primary Plan. If the other plan does n ot have a similar provision and, as a result, the p lans cannot agree on the order of benefit determination, this paragra ph shall not apply. If one of the plans that covers you is issued out of the state whose laws govern this plan, and deter mines the order of benefits based upon the gender of a parent, and as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefit determination, the plan with the gender rules shall determine the order of benefits. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the plan that has covered you for the lon ger period of time shall be primary. Effect on the Benefits Payable If this plan is the Primary Plan, the amount this plan pays for Covered Expenses will be determined w ithout regard for the benefits payable under any other plan. If this plan is the Secondary Plan, the amount thi s plan pays for Covered Expenses is the Allowable E xpense less the amount paid by the Primary Plan during a Claim Determination Period.

However, any claim payments made by Cigna under the plan you ele cted to cancel will be deducted from any such refun d of Premium. Recovery of Excess Benefits If this Policy is the Secondary Plan and Cigna pays for Covered Expenses that should have been paid by the Primary Plan, or if Cigna pays any amount in excess of what it is obligated to pay, Cigna will have the right to recover the actual overpayment made. Cigna will have sole discretion t o seek such recovery from any person to, or for who m, or with respect to whom, such services were provided or suc h payments made by any insurance company, healthcar e plan or other organization.

Adverse determination means: A denial of a preauthorization for a covered benef it; A denial of a request for benefits for an individu al on the ground that the treatment or covered bene fit is not medically necessary, appropriate, effective, or eff icient or is not provided in or at the appropriate health care setting or level of care; A rescission or cancellation of coverage under a h ealth coverage plan that is not attributable to fai lure to pay premiums and that is applied retroactively; A denial of a request for benefits on the ground t hat the treatment or service is experimental or inv estigational; or A denial of coverage to an individual based on an initial eligibility determination. Requests for appeal regarding an adverse determinat ion of the Insured Person's issue will be conducted by a Committee, which consists of one or more people not previously involved in the prior decision. The Co mmittee will consult with at least one Physician in the same or similar specialty as the care under consideration, as determined by Cigna's Physician reviewer. For all other coverage plan-related appeals, a review will be conducted b y someone who COINDEPO052021 Cigna Connect Flex Silver 4500 Rx Co pay (200-250% FPL) MIEP0482 79 was a) not involved in any previous decision relate d to the Insured Person's appeal, and b) not a subo rdinate of previous decision makers.

If the Insured Perso n requests that the appeal be expedited based on (a) above, the Ins ured Person may also ask for an expedited external Independent Review at the same time, if the time to complete an expedited internal appeal would be detrimental to the Insured Person's medical condition.
