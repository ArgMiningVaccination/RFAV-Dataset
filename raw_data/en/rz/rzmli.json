I am pleased to present the 2010-2011 Guidebook For New Department Heads and Senior Managers. With its simple and straightforward narrative, the Guidebook provides an overview of the City and County of San Francisco's government structure as well as its rich and diverse history. Although written as a primer for new department heads and managers, the Guidebook is truly a key reference for anyone interested in learning how this twenty-first century institution with mid-nineteenth century roots operates in a complex and ever-changing world. We hope the Guidebook provides you with the information you need to achieve success and satisfaction during your tenure here. Edwin M.

Introduction I-1INtrODUCtION wHY wAS tHIS GUIDEBOOk wrIttEN? Our City government is like a giant jigsaw puzzle. In building the puzzle, corners appear, details emerge, but the whole picture is not clear until all the pieces fit together. And so it goes with City government. It is a large, complicated entity, a bureaucracy of about 27,000 employees with laws, rules and regulations, that ministers to a highly diverse and political citizenry. If you are new to the City, you will have a steep learning curve. Yes, the City makes available plenty of resource manuals, bulletins and memos, but there is so much to read and learn and absorb that trying to digest it all at once slows down your ability to comprehend the whole picture. This introductory primer is intended to help new department heads and senior managers navigate the complexities of our City government. Although there are numerous sources of information available in electronic and other formats, trying to put all the organizational pieces together can be overwhelming. We hope that the Guidebook makes it less so. OrGANIZAtION OF tHIS GUIDEBOOk Our guiding principles were simple: select ten topics and keep it short. Procedures and descriptions are organized by general steps and include key exceptions. In the Executive Summary section, each topic is covered in three pages or less. At the end of each summary, there is a reference section with source titles, phone numbers and websites to access additional information. Most of the topics have a corresponding section in the Section III, Appendices where readers can find more detailed information. Our City government is dynamic, and information changes frequently. Consequently, we shall be updating the Guidebook periodically. Please let us know if the Guidebook is helpful. We welcome your suggestions and comments.II.

San Francisco Government History A-2SAN FrANCISCO GOvErNMENt HIStOrY In 1845, the pueblo of Yerba Buena was a sleepy village, dirty, dusty, muddy and inhabited by a couple hundred people, \"a polyglot congregation of hustlers, vagabonds, eccentrics, hedonists and traders...\" (Cole, p. 20)1. On July 9, 1846, seventy soldiers and marines from the United States Ship Portsmouth came ashore, marched into the plaza, planted the Stars and Stripes and proclaimed Yerba Buena for the United States of America. On January 30, 1847, the appointed executive, Alcalde Lt. Washington Bartlett decreed that Yerba Buena, with its population now at 459, should henceforth be known as San Francisco. In January, 1848, with James Marshall's discovery of gold at Coloma in the Sierra foothills, San Francisco's destiny was forged. The news traveled like wild fire, and gold-seekers from every corner of the world soon poured through the Golden Gate on their way to the gold fields. By 1849 there were 50,000 people living in San Francisco. The pueblo dissolved and the City was born. San Francisco's first modern municipal government was created on April 15, 1850 when the state legislature voted to incorporate the city. Thus, the title to the Pueblo Lands was vested by charter in the City of San Francisco. The 1850 Charter was repealed and replaced in 1851. That Charter was repealed in 1854. Subsequent charters were repealed in 1855, 1900, 1931 and 1996. It was said that the 1856 Charter was so inefficient that \"...nobody knew what it meant except the city clerk and one or two other people.\" (Martin Judnick, San Francisco Government, 1967) The Consolidation Act of 1856 separated San Mateo from San Francisco and established San Francisco as both, a city and county, the only such entity in the state. \"When the Board of Supervisors approves an ordinance, it is generally acting in a municipal capacity, although the ordinance may affect county services as well.\" (League, p. 5) 2 However, certain departments, such as Elections, perform county functions and therefore operate under state law. The 1932 Charter determined the governance of the city until November 1995 when the voters approved a new charter that took effect on July 1, 1996. The new charter created a strong mayor and gave greater powers to the Board of Supervisors. CHArtEr AND ADMINIStrAtIvE CODE The San Francisco Charter is the fundamental law of the consolidated City and County of San Francisco. It delineates the rights, powers and authority granted to the separate branches of the government. It can only be amended by a majority of the voters. The Administrative Code is a compilation of the ordinances enacted by the Board of Supervisors. It establishes rules, regulations and the conduct of the administration of our city government. Both the Charter and the Administrative Code can be found on the City's homepage under Municipal Codes.II. Executive Summaries B. Board of Supervisors Guidebook City & County of San FranciscoGuidebook City & County of San Francisco II. Executive Summaries B. Board of Supervisors B-2BOArD OF SUPErvISOrS Since San Francisco's incorporation in 1850, its citizens have struggled over what shape and form its government would take and how its representatives should be elected. The 1853 Charter divided the city into eight wards. Each ward elected its own assessor and two representatives to the Common Council, which consisted of two houses\u2014the Board of Aldermen (two-year terms) and the Board of Assistant Aldermen (one-year terms). In 1856, fed up with crime and corruption, the Second Committee of Vigilance took control of the city and its government for several months and called for reform. Under the 1855-56 charter, twelve supervisors were to be elected by districts with an at-large elected president (renamed mayor in 1861), who could vote only to break ties. The 1900 charter called for an eighteen-member Board of Supervisors and a mayor elected at-large. Although the charter provided for a strong mayor, it also allowed boards and commissions to hire their own executives. The 1900 charter also provided for the initiative and referendum process and civil service. While the city prospered and grew, the graft and corruption continued, culminating in indictments and the Graft Trials of 1907-08. During the thirty years of the 1900 Charter, the city constantly experienced events that drew attention away from the serious weaknesses of its government: labor unrest, destruction and rebuilding resulting from the 1906 Earthquake and Fire, a world's fair, World War I, the prosperous 1920's and finally, the Great Depression. But with the end of prosperity came the realization that San Francisco must put its house in order. In 1931, an elected body, the Board of Freeholders framed a new charter that would take effect in 1932. It established a Board of Supervisors with eleven members to be elected at-large. It addressed the corruption that had chronically plagued the City by: (1) preventing the centralization of power; (2) creating an independent office headed by a chief administrative officer charged with overseeing all City departments that let contracts; (3) providing for a controller responsible for the City's financial matters. The 1932 Charter determined the structure of governance for sixty-three years. In November 1995, the citizens voted to enact a new charter that dramatically changed City government. It centralized power by replacing the independent Chief Administrative Officer with a City Administrator responsible to the Mayor and thus brought the former CAO departments under the authority of the Mayor. The Board of Supervisors was also given new authority. Meanwhile, the method of electing Supervisors has bounced back and forth. In 1976, the voters chose to institute district elections in 1977. San Franciscans, pained and disillusioned by the 1978 assassinations of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk by Supervisor Dan White, went back to the polls in 1980 and repealed district elections.Guidebook City & County of San Francisco II.

The City map was divided into supervisorial districts, and in November 2000, supervisors were again elected by district. Today, the Board of Supervisors consists of eleven members elected by voters in their individual districts. Each Supervisor has an office in City Hall on the second floor. Every Supervisor has two legislative aides, who are often assisted by interns. Supervisors in the early days did not have offices at City Hall. They were businessmen who would come to City Hall for an afternoon meeting and then go back to their own offices. Times have changed. The 1995-98 renovation of City Hall included large, spacious offices for each Supervisor and a staff. Supervisors are usually in their offices everyday. Pay raises have enabled them to treat the position as a full-time job. As a new department head, you should make it a point to introduce yourself to the Supervisors. They will appreciate the courtesy. Their actions will have a direct effect on your department. The Board sets policy, enacts laws and approves the City budget (which includes your budget) each year. It is also useful to acquaint yourself with the Clerk of the Board, Angela Calvillo and her staff. They are hardworking, knowledgeable and always generous with their time and assistance. For more information on the Board of Supervisors, please refer to the Appendices where we have included an explanation of San Francisco's legislative process. You will also find a listing of former members of the Board dating back to 1942.II. Executive Summaries C. Mayor Guidebook City & County of San FranciscorEFErENCES * Mayor's website: http://www.sfgov.org/mayor telephone Numbers Mayor's Office......................(415) 554-6141 Guidebook City & County of San Francisco II. Executive Summaries C. Mayor C-2MAYOr throughout the history of our city, the degrees of power and authority vested in the Mayor have shifted back and forth depending on the times and extent of the citizens' distrust of government. For years, it was thought that the City Hall destroyed by the 1906 Earthquake and Fire took twenty-nine years to build because of the ongoing graft that siphoned off the funds. In fact, it took that long in part because the populace, suspicious of public expenditures, refused to allow one large appropriation. Instead, the Board of Supervisors was required to resort to selling off public lands and special annual assessments. Consequently, a small amount of money was doled out one year at a time. When that money was spent, all work would have to stop until the next year's budget was set. The destruction of the city in 1906 changed things. San Francisco had to rebuild as soon as possible to remain a viable center of trade and commerce. San Franciscans were still suspicious of government and in 1909 voted down the first bond measure to build a new City Hall. But in 1911, James \"Sunny Jim\" Rolph, a genial businessman from the Mission District was elected Mayor. With his charm and conviviality, he convinced the voters that a civic center with City Hall as the crown jewel was only befitting a metropolis as great as San Francisco. This time, with Rolph as the guarantor and cheerleader, the voters approved an $8 million bond with $3.5 million earmarked for City Hall which, by the way, opened on time in 1915. Under the authority of the 1900 Charter, Sunny Jim presided as a strong mayor for twenty years. The city blossomed, and times were flush. But with the Stock Market Crash in 1929, the deficiencies in the structure of city government became apparent. In 1931, San Franciscans voted to approve a new charter that reduced the Mayor's powers and diffused responsibility for government functions. It had been fun while it lasted, but these were serious times. Throughout the rest of the century, as always, it was the power of the personality rather than the powers granted by charter that characterized the tenures of succeeding mayors. In November 1995, after several failed attempts at charter reform, San Franciscans went to the polls and voted for a new charter to take effect on July 1, 1996. The proponents had convinced the voters that government needed streamlining, that there were no clear lines of authority, that government gridlock was inevitable. Today, as a result of the 1996 Charter, the Mayor enjoys greater power and authority. As chief executive, the Mayor has responsibility for administration and oversight of most City departments in addition to setting policy and budget priorities. Consequently, the Mayor appoints most department heads, most commissioners, negotiates with unions to set employees' wages, benefits and working conditions and has authority over most aspects of City government with the exception of the departments directed by elected officials. For a listing of the Mayor's offices, please refer to Appendix AC.II. Executive Summaries D. Budget Process Guidebook City & County of San FranciscoGuidebook City & County of San Francisco II. Executive Summaries D. Budget Process D-2BUDGEt PrOCESS the annual ritual of hammering out the City's yearly budget is typical of San Francisco's special form of participatory democracy. While the process is formal and follows a strict schedule, it can become a raucous affair when citizens attend the Budget hearings and express their preferences and competition for service dollars. After the citizens and interest groups have weighed in, the Mayor's Budget Director and the Supervisors work out the numbers, and a budget is delivered. PArtICIPANtS The Mayor, as the chief executive, is responsible for developing and proposing the annual budget. With the assistance of his/her Budget Director and fiscal analysts, the Mayor must present a balanced budget every spring. The Board of Supervisors receives the Proposed Budget and is responsible for reviewing, amending and approving the Mayor's Budget. The Board utilizes the contracted services of the Budget Analyst whose office reviews the budget at the direction of the Board as well as analyzes and provides reports on all fiscal matters in legislation throughout the year. Be aware that the Budget Analyst will scrutinize your budget and report back to the Board with questions about the necessity of any line item. The Controller, as the City's chief financial officer, is responsible for projecting how much revenue the City has available to fund the budget, preparing reports and other technical aspects of the budget and insuring that the City meets financial obligations legally and correctly. Department heads receive Budget Instructions from the Mayor and work with the Mayor's Budget Office to develop the department budgets. Throughout the budget process, they prepare program and financial information and answer questions from policymakers and the public. All of this information is taken into consideration in developing the budget. tHE SCHEDULE Although the Board of Supervisors formally approves the annual City budget at the end of July, the budget process actually begins in November of the previous year when the Mayor and the Controller issue policy instructions and technical budget instructions setting the overall direction for the budget. From December through January and February, departments, boards and commissions conduct public hearings to obtain public comment on their proposed annual budgets.Guidebook City & County of San Francisco II.

No later than the first working day of March, the Controller submits the estimates to the Mayor. In May, the Board Budget Committee begins hearings on Citywide budget issues. On the first working day of June, the Mayor's Proposed Budget Book is presented to the Board's Budget Committee. It contains detailed financial information, strategic issues for each department and performance measures. On the first working day of June, General Fund budgets are submitted and hearings continue. The Annual Appropriation Ordinance (AAO), the legal document containing the budget, is available June 1. It contains revenue, expenditure and program budget numbers for all departments and summary budget numbers Citywide. No later than June 30 must the Board of Supervisors pass the Interim Annual Appropriation Ordinance. This is to provide authority for the City to pay its bills between the time the new fiscal year starts on July 1 and the Board of Supervisor's final adoption of the AAO, which must occur no later than the last working day of July. A wOrD ABOUt tHE BUDGEt ANALYSt It is wise for you to familiarize yourself with the office of the Budget Analyst. It plays a central role in the budget process. Virtually each and every issue that involves City money is analyzed for fiscal impact by this office and reported back to the Board of Supervisors. The Budget Analyst is not a City agency, but a contractor that provides independent fiscal analyses and management and audit reports. The contract is a Joint Venture Agreement for Professional Budget Analyst Services between the City and County of San Francisco and Stanton W. Jones and Associates; Debora A. Newman; Rodriguez, Perez, Delgado & Company, CPAs; Harvey M. Rose Associates LLC; and Louie & Wong LLP, CPAs.II. Executive Summaries E. Employment Procedures Guidebook City & County of San FranciscoGuidebook City & County of San Francisco II. Executive Summaries E. Employment E-2EMPLOYMENt PrOCEDUrES As you may have heard, the personnel procedures of municipal government are complicated. A City Hall legend has it that it takes a long time to hire someone, and it's impossible to fire someone. We have an entire department devoted to employment procedures, the Department of Human Resources (DHR). In addition to what DHR does, all of the other departments have a lot to do in this area. As a new department head, you may decide you need people with special qualifications on your management team. The Charter gives you that ability by providing exemption from Civil Service requirements for certain high-level positions. But for the most part, the majority of your employees are civil service, which means they have taken a test, passed through probation and are now permanent City employees. Key to maintaining a smooth-running operation is an understanding of labor relations which is discussed in a separate Summary in this book as well as in the Appendices. This section covers four things: how to hire someone; how to fire someone; how to get paid; and the role of your department's personnel officer. HOw tO HIrE SOMEONE The first question is whether you have a vacant position. If you don't, you'll have to add one and increase your department's overall head count. This requires a change to your budget and triggers the need for all kinds of approvals. If you have a vacant position, is it classified or is it exempt? If it's classified, is there a Civil Service list? If so, you can hire someone only if that person is on the list. If there is no list, you can hire anyone \"provisionally,\" and that person must take a Civil Service test later when the time comes to establish a list for the position. If the position is exempt, then you can hire anyone. That person serves at your pleasure or your successor's. HOw tO FIrE SOMEONE We're getting ahead of ourselves. The City uses progressive discipline, and our goal is to solve an employee's performance problems and make that employee a productive member of City government, rather than to terminate employment. The steps of progressive discipline are: verbal warning, written warning, suspension and termination. There are notice requirements, and you may want to consult with DHR along the way. But you can fire someone if you have to. Although it may be tempting to just hope the poor employee Guidebook City & County of San Francisco II. Executive Summaries E.

HOw tO GEt PAID The City has a two-week pay period. At the end of each week, you report your hours to your personnel group. Your hours are either: regular, vacation, sick, legal or floating holidays. Every second Tuesday, you'll get a check or an advice, which is what you get when your salary is deposited directly into your bank account. Life is much easier for the Controller, the City's payroll processors and you if you have direct deposit. Something like 85% of City employees take the direct deposit option. It saves a lot of time and paper which is good for the environment. YOUr DEPArtMENt'S PErSONNEL OFFICEr (DPO) Your Department Personnel Officer (DPO) is the person in your department who needs to know almost everything about personnel procedures. When you have a personnel question, that's the person you'll talk to first. In smaller departments, the DPO may have other responsibilities, such as the budget. This is the person who will work with the Mayor's Budget Office, DHR, Civil Service Commission (CSC), the City Attorney's Office and others. It's important that this person represent you well and make friends in these other departments. These will be powerful friends. For more information on employment procedures, see Appendix AE.II.

Executive Summaries F. Labor relations F-2LABOr rELAtIONS Since the days of the Gold Rush, labor has been a prized commodity. \"Here Labor controls Capital,\" wrote Port Collector James Collier in 1849. (Cole, p. 81)1 When most new arrivals to the city ran off to the Sierras to seek their fortune, the able-bodied who stayed behind to build the city made fortunes of their own if they were frugal with their $16-a-day wages. Six major fires between 1849 and 1851 created a constant need for construction. The building, the rebuilding, the flow of gold and silver from the mines and the construction of the railroad all led to the creation of a city where the workingman and his labors were in great demand, valued and treated with respect. The balance of power between labor and business shifted back and forth over the next eighty years depending on the economy. But in May, 1934, during the depths of the Depression, an Australian organizer named Harry Bridges led the International Longshoreman's Association (ILA) in a strike that shut down ports up and down the west coast, demanding a $1 minimum wage with $1.50 overtime, six-hour days, 30-hour weeks and, most importantly, union control of the hiring halls and closed shops on the docks. The Teamsters Union supported the strikers by refusing to haul to and from the docks, and other unions joined the strike. In July, Bridges called a general strike that shut down the City for four days\u2014the largest and most successful general strike in American history. This victory for labor established San Francisco once and for all as a union town. In that context, it should come as no surprise that most City employees are represented by unions or associations that bargain on their behalf with respect to working conditions, grievances, salaries and wages. As a department head or manager, you, along with approximately one thousand of your colleagues, are represented by the Municipal Executives Association (MEA). Since 1991, MEA has been the exclusive representative of high-level City executives and managers for the purpose of contract negotiations. Through these negotiations, salary increases, health insurance, training funds and other benefits are provided. Dues, which are $25 per pay period, are voluntary. MEA has a small staff and contracts for legal services. As a member, you receive a newsletter every month, announcements of training seminars and tuition reimbursement for seminars. For more information regarding the collective bargaining process and union representation, see Appendix AF.II. Executive Summaries G. Purchasing/Contracts Guidebook City & County of San FranciscoGuidebook City & County of San Francisco II. Executive Summaries G. Purchasing/Contracts G-2HOw tO BUY tHINGS to run your department, you will need goods and services. This chapter gives you an overview of how to obtain them. As with the other sections in the Guidebook, we're giving you general rules. All the rules have exceptions, and some might be listed. The rules for obtaining products and services are complicated. This section introduces you to the subject. A more detailed explanation of City's purchasing requirements can be found in the Appendix. AUtHOrItY tO MAkE PUrCHASES A caveat, and we don't mean this to sound harsh, but this limitation can come as a surprise to a new City employee. With the exception of the Metropolitan Transportation Agency, a department head does not have the authority to call a vendor and order something. Similarly, you do not have the authority to sign a contract. The authority to buy goods and services is vested, by charter, in the Office of Contract Administration/Purchasing. DO YOU HAvE tHE MONEY? Before you do anything else, check with your finance group and determine if you have enough money to purchase the product or service you're interested in. If you don't, one alternative is to request a supplemental appropriation from the Board of Supervisors. CAN tHE CItY DO BUSINESS wItH tHE vENDOr YOU HAvE IN MIND? Maybe. The City has passed several \"selective purchasing\" ordinances, which require vendors to meet certain standards to receive City business. If the vendor complies, fine. If not, you might need to request a waiver from another office before submitting a requisition, or you might not be able to do business with the vendor at all. The ordinances include:* Admin. Code Chapter 12B, Equal Benefits * Admin. Code Chapter 12P, Minimum Compensation Ordinance (MCO) * Admin. Code Chapter 12Q, Health Care Accountability Ordinance (HCAO) * Admin. Code Chapter 14B, Local Business Enterprise (LBE) * Business Tax. If the vendor owes the City business taxes, the City can't order anything from the vendor until the taxes are paid. tYPES OF PUrCHASES Here are major types of purchases, with brief descriptions, loosely in order of increasing complexity. Office supplies This is easy. OCA has set up contracts with an office supply company. All departments have catalogs from this company. Someone in your department is in charge of placing office supply orders. Get a copy of the catalog, and tell that person what you need.Guidebook City & County of San Francisco II. Executive Summaries G. Purchasing/Contracts G-3Goods and services below $200 A department can call a vendor and order anything below $200, and then just pay the invoice. You don't need a purchase order (PO) first. Remember, the vendor with whom you place an order with must comply with all vendor requirements, no exceptions. Goods and services below $10,000 Most departments have received authority from Purchasing to create their own purchase orders for products and general services up to $10,000. This means you can create your own purchase order instead of submitting a requisition to OCA. Goods and services covered by Citywide Term Contracts A Citywide Term Contract is a contract that Purchasing has established with a vendor. All the specifications, prices and ordering procedures are set, and so departments may place orders directly with the vendor instead of going through Purchasing. Major contracts include: * Office supplies * Technology Store (Special ordering rules apply.) * Copier rentals General services General services are non-professional services (see next paragraph). Either Purchasing solicits bids, or a department presents reasons why competitive bidding is not applicable. Professional services This is about as complicated as it gets. You need to request and obtain the approval of the Civil Service Commission if, for example, you require the services of a consultant. Then you need to conduct a Request-for-Proposal (RFP) process to select the vendor. From start to finish, it will take months from the time you decide you need professional services to the day the contractor will start work. rEFErENCES * \"How to Do Business with the City and County of San Francisco\" http://www.sfgov.org/oca/purchasingtelephone Numbers Director, OCA......................................554-7738 Director, DHR.....................................557-4845Executive Officer, CSC.......................252-3250II.

Emergency Services I-2EMErGENCY SErvICES No one who happened to be in San Francisco on October 17, 1989 will ever forget where they were at 5:04 p.m. when the Loma Prieta earthquake rumbled through the ground leaving a trail of death, destruction, fear and confusion. In San Francisco alone, the fifteen-second earthquake resulted in eleven deaths and hundreds of injured. Thirty buildings either collapsed or were immediately demolished. Thirty-four fires ignited, caused by the quake and its aftershocks. The flames from the fire in the Marina district provided the only night light in a city left without any electricity late into the morning hours and beyond. San Francisco was incapacitated for a brief period of time. While City offices were closed and City business at a standstill, the Fire and Police Departments under the direction of Mayor Art Agnos, worked day and night for weeks. The Mayor enlisted the services of City employees to help in all capacities: staffing emergency centers, providing shelter, blankets and food, expediting the review processes for allowing people to reenter their homes. But more than three-quarters of a century after the Great Earthquake and Fire of 1906, the City saw that it could happen again. More recently, the horrendous September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington D.C. underscored the vulnerability of our city and the critical need for emergency preparedness. The Department of Emergency Management (DEM) at 1011 Turk Street serves to meet that need. DEM is comprised of two primary divisions: the Division of Emergency Communications (9-1-1) and the Division of Emergency Services. All City employees, whether they know it or not, are on call in the event of an emergency. You, as a department head, may have special duties set out in the City's Emergency Management Program or in your department's emergency plan. You should familiarize with your plan sooner rather than later. You never know when you will be called upon. We encourage you to call DEM to arrange a visit and learn about our emergency services and response capability. Meanwhile, we offer you an Emergency Management Fact Sheet with pertinent information for you and your staff. rEFErENCES * Emergency Preparedness Information http://www.72hours.orgtelephone Numbers Director, DEM.....................................558-2745Emergency Communications................558-3800 Emergency Services..............................487-5000Guidebook City & County of San Francisco II.

Emergency Services I-3EMErGENCY SErvICES FACt SHEEt FOr DEPArtMENt HEADS Mayoral Powers In the event of a declared emergency, the Charter of the City and County of San Francisco (Section 3.100) grants the Mayor broad powers intended to protect the lives, property and welfare of citizens and visitors to San Francisco. These powers include the authority to direct personnel and resources of any City department to perform additional or alternate duties deemed necessary to meet the emergency need. These powers are further defined in Chapter 7.6 of the Administrative Code. Director of the Department of Emergency Management There are two primary divisions within the Department of Emergency Management, the Division of Emergency Communications and the Division of Emergency Services, each with an assigned Deputy Director. The Division of Emergency Communications manages the Combined Emergency Communications Center and related systems and directs all operations related to taking calls from members of the public seeking emergency, Police, Fire and medical assistance as well as the dispatch of these services. The Division of Emergency Services is responsible for supporting Citywide activities related to disaster prevention, response, preparedness, mitigation and recovery. The Executive Director of the Department of Emergency Management is appointed by the Mayor. In addition to directing the day to day activities of the department, additional charter responsibilities include oversight of emergency preparedness and management activities. The Executive Director is responsible for developing and maintaining the City's comprehensive Emergency Management Program. The Executive Director also serves as the Executive Secretary of the Disaster Council. During a major emergency, the Executive Director advises the Mayor and others on matters related to emergency management as part of the Policy Group. Together with the public safety chiefs and key department heads, the Policy Group sets the high-level priorities that direct the response efforts of the City. Disaster Council In accordance with the California Emergency Services Act, the City and County of San Francisco has an accredited Disaster Council chaired by the Mayor. The Disaster Council is composed of heads of major departments, each bearing responsibility under the Emergency Operations Plan, key City officials and three members of the Board of Supervisors (appointed by the President of the Board). It also includes representatives from the non-profit and business communities. The Council meets quarterly and at the call of the Mayor. Disaster Service Worker Designation Under California Government Code Section 3100, all public employees are declared to be disaster service workers and may be assigned to disaster service activities by their superiors. Guidebook City & County of San Francisco II. Executive Summaries I. Emergency Services I-4All City workers are expected to respond to emergencies. Emergency service work may include the performance of duties vastly different than those listed in workers' normal job descriptions and may be carried out under hardship conditions. Some examples of disaster service worker positions are: shelter worker, logistical support worker, driver and call center operator. In October 2007, Mayor Newsom issued an Executive Directive requiring that City departments ensure that their non-sworn staff has completed both the Department of Human Resources Disaster Service Worker training and required National Incident Management System (NIMS) training by June 30, 2008. The Directive also mandated that sworn and non-sworn staffs of City departments have completed the Personal Preparedness training by December 31, 2008. Executive Directive Mandates - ED 06-01 and ED 07-10 Mayor Newsom has issued two Executive Directives that relate to department roles for disaster preparedness and response. Department heads and managers should review these Directives to ensure continued compliance. ED 06-01 states: \"Each City department shall appoint a Disaster Preparedness Coordinator to be responsible for coordination of emergency preparedness activities in their respective departments.\" The Disaster Preparedness Coordinator shall be either the department head or a senior departmental staff member who reports directly to the department head.\" Emergency Plans Emergency Operations PlanChapter 7 of the Administrative Code requires the development of a City Emergency Operations Plan. This plan describes and identifies the City's actions during the response to an emergency, the role of the City's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and the coordination that occurs between the EOC and City departments and agencies. Guidance on this topic is available from the Department of Emergency Management. Department Emergency Plan In an emergency, the Mayor looks to each department to organize, manage and execute emergency actions necessary to protect lives and property and to restore basic public services. To do this, each department is required to maintain a department emergency plan that provides for the protection of staff, continuity of critical department functions and support with respect to the City's Emergency Operations Plan. Guidance on this topic is available from the Department of Emergency Management.Guidebook City & County of San Francisco II. Executive Summaries I. Emergency Services I-5Emergency response Emergency Contact City departments are expected to maintain an emergency contact roster and mobilization plans for their own personnel. Emergency Operations Center The Department of Emergency Management maintains the City's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 1011 Turk Street. The Emergency Communications Division is also located in this seismically safe structure. The Mayor, the Executive Director of DEM or his/her designee may activate the EOC during any situation where the need for EOC- level coordination is evident. EOC activation levels and procedures are scalable based on the changing needs of an event. Departments with responsibilities under the Emergency Management Program may be expected to serve in the EOC. If an event exceeds the capacity of the current EOC, or if the facility is otherwise unavailable, an alternate EOC will be identified. Policy GroupAccording to the needs created by an emergency or event, the Mayor may convene a group of CCSF officials to provide advice on policy issues affecting CCSF and to respond to requests for policy direction from the EOC. The Policy Group may meet during the initial stage of an emergency and periodically during the event as directed by the Mayor. Recovery Costs associated with disasters may be reimbursable under state and federal recovery programs. Accurate and detailed record keeping is imperative if departments intend to apply for state or federal reimbursement. Departments are expected to keep accurate records during an incident and to coordinate with the Controller's Office during a declared emergency event to apply for reimbursement. If the EOC is activated, finance activities may be carried out through the EOC Finance Section. Questions about reimbursement procedures or requests for training on state and federal programs may be directed to the Controller's Office.II. Executive Summaries J.

Executive Summaries J. Conflict of Interest/Sunshine Ordinance J-2CONFLICt OF INtErESt Once you become a public official, and that is what you are if you are a department head, you must be especially careful to observe the laws relating to conflicts of interest. It may be flattering to receive tickets to the opening of the opera and the attendant parties, box seats at the ballpark or be treated to dinner by lobbyists or prospective contractors at any one of our great restaurants. But as a public official, you are subject to a higher standard of ethics, and every gift you receive over an amount certain must be reported on a government form and filed with the Ethics Commission. All City officers and employees are subject to conflict of interest and government ethics laws that are found in state law, the San Francisco Charter and Campaign and Governmental Conduct Code. Under these laws, public officials may not make, participate in making or in any way seek to influence governmental decisions in which they have a disqualifying conflict of interest. The conflict of interest laws also govern: the receipt of gifts or other things of value from regulated sources; compensated advocacy; political activity during working hours; disclosure of confidential information; incompatible activities, receipt of compensation, reward or gift from any source other than the City for services related to the governmental processes of the City; and post-employment activities among other restrictions. Public officials and designated employees with significant decision-making authority (those listed in section 3.1-100 et seq. of the Campaign and Governmental Conduct Code) must disclose their personal financial interests on financial disclosure forms called \"Statements of Economic Interests\" (\"SEIs\" or \"Form 700\"). Elected and appointed officials must file the SEIs, which are public records, within 30 days of assuming office and annually by April 1. These reports are considered public documents and often read by newspaper reporters and members of the public. The Ethics Commission has a \"Manual on Governmental Ethics Laws\" that discusses many of these laws. The manual is available from the Commission's office at 25 Van Ness Avenue, Suite 220, San Francisco and on its website. Additionally, the City Attorney publishes the Good Government Guide, which provides an overview of the laws governing the conduct of public officials. Further information can be found in the Good Government Guide Supplement. Both documents can be found on the City Attorney's website.Guidebook City & County of San Francisco II. Executive Summaries J. Conflict of Interest/Sunshine Ordinance J-3SUNSHINE OrDINANCE we San Franciscans take our democracy seriously. We are actively involved in the processes of government. We attend public meetings and participate, we write letters, we request information. Ever cognizant of the activist nature our citizenry, in 1993 the Board of Supervisors approved the Sunshine Ordinance and incorporated it into the Administrative Code as Chapter 67. In November 1999, the voters approved Proposition G, amending the Sunshine Ordinance to include new provisions. The Sunshine Ordinance expanded the provisions of two state laws already on the books, the Brown Act and the Public Records Act. All three of these laws deal with the public's right to open government by guaranteeing access with respect to public meetings and public records. Where state and local laws differ, the City adheres to the more rigorous standard. The Sunshine Ordinance governs the conduct of City commissions, boards and committees. It allows the public to address meetings, requires responses to immediate disclosure requests within twenty-four hours and eliminates the deliberative process privilege. Some of the details of the Sunshine Ordinance include:Access to Public Records * Immediate disclosure of public records within twenty-four hours, and the City may not refuse to provide records under the balancing test or the deliberative process privilege. * Calendars of the Mayor, City Attorney and department heads * Records relating to employee misconduct, e-mail, annual reports * City contracts, rating panel sheets, sole source contracts and certain franchises, leases and permits * Outside sources of funding and disclosure of financial interest of donor * Retention of professional records by department heads and elected officials * Maintenance of City documents and Index of Records Access to Public Meetings* A public meeting refers to meetings of commissions, committees, boards or other bodies created by the Charter, ordinance, resolution or formal action of a legal body. * Any board, commission, task force, sub-committee or other body created by a public body * Any such body created by a federal, state or local grant whose members are appointed by City officials, employees or agents * Agendas for regular meetings must be noticed seventy-two hours before the meeting. The agenda must include a meaningful description of each item of business and the proposed action. rEFErENCES * Sunshine Ordinance (Admin.

Seating in the Chamber: Rules of Order 6.21 provides that vacant seats in the Chamber shall be assigned on the basis of seniority, and that Supervisors shall not involuntarily be displaced, except that a retiring president, when reached in seniority, may choose to occupy either a vacant seat or a seat occupied by a Supervisor with less seniority. A selection of seats is made each time the composition of the Board changes (after elections and appointments) along with the selection of offices and parking spaces, all based on seniority. Parking: Parking passes are issued to Board members to park in a numbered permit space on the street on the east side of City Hall. Permits are valid only for the spaces to which they are assigned.

III. Appendices AD. Controller's Office Guidebook City & County of San FranciscoA Guide to San Francisco's Budget ProcessBudget Year 2010 -11 Prepared by City and County of San Francisco Controller's Office January 6, 20102A Guide to San Francisco's Budget Process City & County of San Francisco, Controller's Office Introduction Balancing the BudgetEach year the City and County of San Francisco spends billions of dollars to maintain and improve our libraries and parks, to pave roads, and to operatehospitals, the Airport and City Hall. The City runs MUNI, provides police, fire and emergency medical services and also collects taxes. During the budgetprocess, critical decisions are made about all public services. Choices are made about spending on health care, children's programs, jails, and hundreds of other public services and facilities. City services significantly impact your daily life. Stay informed -attend a public meeting, call or send an e - mail or a letter to yourelected representatives and talk with your neighbors. Your tax dollars go into the budget, and public input on how the money is spent is vital. This brochure will help you navigate the City & County's budget process and provides key timeline and meeting information to help you stay informed. The Constitution of the State of California requires all cities to adopt a balanced budget. This means that: Sources or Revenues = Uses or Costs One of the challenges each year is that the City must estimate its revenues and costs as far as 18 months in advance. Another challenge is that the City Charter and State law in many cases restrict how revenue may be generated and oftentimes specify how the Ci ty must spend available funds. In some years, yet another challenge is that projectedcost increases are expected to outpace revenue growth. For Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 -10, a shortfall of $438 million (equal to 8% of the City's General Fund supported budget) is projected due to decreases in projected year- end fund balance, declining revenues due to the weak economy, State budget cuts, increased voter- approved baseline funding requirements (Proposition A, Nov. 2007) and increasing City operating costs. While the Bay Area economy is strong in many areas, challenges still exist. The moderate growth in new jobs has resulted in some increase in employment -related local revenues, and property - related revenues reflect stability in real estate values, although revenues realized over the past few years from the transfer of commercial properties has sharply declined. Economic downturn in other parts of California have negatively impacted the State's budget and Citywide costs have continued to climb, in large part due to escalating employee salaryand benefit costs related to labor agreement provisions, new mandates and capital funding. As a result, the City will have to either reduce projected cost increases or increase revenues.

Each department breaks down its budget and staff into programs -smaller units with specific jobs to do. For example, the Fire Department's programs include Fire Prevention, Fire Suppression & Investigation. A program is often the best way to understand and critique the budget -at this level youcan see the trends, the decisions that your City is making, and the specific services being funded. TheMayor's Budget Book (Proposed Budget) and the Annual AppropriationOrdinance (Adopted Budget) each show the City budget by program. Every department is required by law to measure and report on its performance. These measures can show the effectiveness of different City services and the money spent on them. For example, the Human Services Agency measures the number of people receiving job training who successfully earn income and stop receiving public assistance. TheMayor's Budget Book and the Controller's Citizen Survey each show performance measures, comparisons, and ratings of the quality of City Services from year to year. The City Survey is compl eted every other year. The last survey was completed in April 2009.E very department pays salaries to its staff, buys materials and supplies, and contracts with private businesses or with non -profit organizations to build things or to provide services. Many departments collect fees, receive grant funding, or generate other kinds of revenue. By reviewing the sources side of a department's budget, you will be able to tell how much of their costs are being covered through both tax and non- tax revenues (that is, fees and service charges). TheMayor's Budget Book and the Annual Appropriation Ordinance both show department budgets this way -by type of revenue and expense.TheAnnual Appropriation Ordinance and the Controller's Citizen Survey are available on the Controller's Office website (www.sfgov.org/controller) 4Who Participates in the Budget Process?

Payroll & Personnel Services Division Payroll and Personnel Services Division (PPSD) is the central processing center for payroll for the City and County of San Franci sco. The functions of the division are as follows: Timesheet Processing The City pays its employees on a biweekly basi s. All time is reported to the departmental payroll offices and entered into time entry subs ystems. The time entered into subsystems is transmitted to the mainframe payroll syst em on the Wednesday before payday. Once all the data is edited and reviewed, the payr oll is processed on Thursday night and checks and reports are printed on the Friday before payday. TESS (Time Entry Scheduling System) The City uses a time and attendance system called TESS. Most departments are using this standard for time input processing. Th e system allows for the rules found in the union contracts to be applied. New Hires, Terminations and Changes Departments prepare new hire forms after receiving approval from the Department of Human Resources (DHR). These forms are su bmitted to PPSD for data entry into the centralized payroll system. After the em ployee is on the system, a timesheet can be processed. The new hire form should be submitted as soon as possible so that the employee can be paid in a timely manner. Employees cannot be paid until the new hire form is authorized and processed by PPSD. Changes and terminations are processed on Personnel Action Request (PAR) forms, which are turnaround documents produced by the payroll system. All of these transactions are handled by the payroll or personnel office of your department and require an authorized signature. DOING BUSINESS WITH THE CONTROLLER 'SOFFICE PAGE 12 Adjustments, Deduction s and Manual Checks PPSD processes adjustments to correct pay problems from prior pay periods, processes retroactive payments, and prepare manual check s if an employee did not receive a check on payday. The departmental payroll office prepares a Problem Description Form (PDF) and submits it to PPSD for processing. PPSD reviews and enters it into the system for payment on the next appropriate pay cycle. If the submitted document has a problem, PPSD contacts the departmental payroll office to resolve the discrepancy. PPSD issues a manual check if necessary, but makes every effort to add the adjustment to the next pay cycle. PPSD sets up all payroll deductions, such as voluntary deductions like Electronic Fund Transfers (EFT) of paychecks to employees' banks and union dues, as well as involuntary deductions such as garnishments and IRS le vies. The Retirement System controls retirement deductions; the Health Service Syst em controls health insurance deductions. Replacing Lost or Stale-Dated Payroll Checks You request replacement for lost or stale- dated payroll checks through your department payroll section. To have the check repl aced, your department payroll section will complete the LOST PAYCHECK INFORMATION side of the LOST PAYCHECK AFFIDAVIT FORM and have it signed by your depart ment's appointing officer. The employee will complete and sign the EMPLOYEE INFORMATION portion of the affidavit form. The employee or your department payroll section will send the original signed LOST PAYCHECK AFFIDAVIT FORM to the Controller's PPSD, at 875 Stevenson St., Room 235, San Francisco, CA 94103, to have the paycheck replaced. If your department payroll section does not have the form ,contact Maria Delos Reyes (PPSD), at 558-7847 . Taxes and Reconciliation PPSD receives and processes employee W-4 forms for each employee so that they have the appropriate tax deduction on their paycheck. PPSD then remits the federal, state and social security taxes to the government. PPSD interfaces with the accounting system each pay period and reconciles the payroll accounts with FAMIS Accounting. Biweekly payroll accounting reports are sent to the departments with the paychecks. Paycheck Distribution Every two weeks, PPSD produces approximately 30,000 checks/advices and numerous reports for the entire City. The day before payday, the reports and checks are bundled together and picked up from 875 Stevens on St. by messengers and taken to the departmental payroll and/or personnel offices for distribution. Problem Resolution Start with your payroll and/or personnel o ffice if you have is a question or problem. PPSD has a good working relationship with each departmental payroll office and they know how to address most issues. Contact Seretha Gallaread at 558-7865 and she will direct you to the best person to solve your problem.

Department fiscal officers or someone designated by your fiscal officer must authorize training in writing or via e-mail sent through the department's designated traini ng coordinator. The training coordinator forwards the pertinent information to th e AOSD training registrar, who will forward security forms for completion. ONLINE FAMIS security and password setup are required prior to attending classes. Contact Myrna Evangelista in the Systems Division at 554-7484. Are all encumbrances automatically cl osed out at fiscal year-end? How do you carry forward encumbrances? At fiscal year-end, the Controller's Office issues a memorandum to all departments regarding the Annual Appropriation Carryfor ward Request. This memorandum provides departments with instructions on how to request a carryforward of unexpended annual appropriations. Unencumbered balances of all annual appropriations are automatically closed to Fund Balance at fiscal year-end. However, unencumbered balances of funds budgeted for specific non-recurring items or services that are not in the base budget for that fiscal year and that could not be fully spent or encumbered by fiscal year-end can be requested for carryforward to the next fiscal year. These carryforwards must be used in the next fiscal year for the same purpose fo r which they were originally budgeted; otherwise, the department must submit a re quest for supplemental appropriation to the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors. Audits What is the difference between financial and performance audits? Financial audits determine wh ether departments present fina ncial information fairly, and whether internal controls are adequate a nd assets are properly safeguarded. Financial audits also review the propriety of transactions. Performance audits determine if programs, policies, and procedures of departments are producing their intended or desired results. Performance audits measure the efficiency and effectiveness of City operations, and whether a department or program has complied with applicable laws and regulations. DOING BUSINESS WITH THE CONTROLLER 'SOFFICE A TTACHMENTS PAGE 14 Who decides which department s or programs are audited? State or local laws mandate some audits, pa rticularly financial audits. The Mayor's Office, the Board of Supervisors, or the depa rtments themselves may request other audits. Also, a whistleblower complaint may result in an investigative audit. Finally, the Controller and the Audits Organization may decide to conduct audits based on information they have received about probl ems or deficiencies in a department or program. Once an audit is completed, what happens? An audit report is written and issued to the Mayor's Office, Board of Supervisors, Civil Grand Jury, auditee, various other agenci es, and the public. The reports identify problems or deficiencies and make recomme ndations for correcting them. The Audits Organization follows-up with the auditee six months, one year, and two years after the report is issued to ensure that action on th e recommendations has been taken. Audit reports are presented on the Controller's Office internet website: http://www.sfgov.org/site/controller > Reports Budgets & Analysis What is the BPMS (Budget and Pe rformance Measurement) System and where can I get training on it? The BPMS System is a part of the City's interconnected electronic financial system, which also includes ONLINE FAMIS (Financial Accounting and Management Information System). BPMS is used thr oughout the budget development process. Data from it underlies all reports the Mayor's Office and the Board of Supervisors use to review and approve departme ntal budgets. When the budget process is complete, the data in BPMS is interfaced into ONLINE FA MIS where it becomes your budget for the new fiscal year. BPMS data also is used to generate th e Annual Appropriation Ordinance (AAO) and the Annual Salary Ordinance (ASO). These two doc uments are the City's official legislation giving, respectively, appropriation authority and position authority for the fiscal year. Departments should organize their BPMS hierar chy and data to reflect how they actually operate. The Controller's Office Budget and Analysis Division provides training in December of each year. Contact Tom DiSanto at 554-7554 for more information. How do I know the stat us of my budget? Each month, the Controller's Office sends expenditure and re venue reports to departments. These show the status of a ppropriations and project selected sources and uses of funds to fiscal year end. In addition, on-line departments can retrieve up-to-date fiscal information from ONLINE FAMIS .DOING BUSINESS WITH THE CONTROLLER 'SOFFICE A TTACHMENTS PAGE 15 What's the difference between budg et, appropriation, and allotment? A budget begins by a department requesting funding. The request goes to the Mayor, is then reviewed and approved by the Board of Supervisors, and then enacted into an ordinance called the Annual Appropriation Ordinance (AAO). An appropriation is an authorization to expend money for specific purposes (salaries, services, equipment, etc.). Allotments make portions of an appropriati on available for expenditure. The Controller can set up allotments to be quarterly or semiannually. The allotment schedule ensures that departments do not over-expend their appropria tions before the end of the fiscal year. An allotment schedule can be adjusted to m eet unusual circumstances if the department can demonstrate to the Contro ller that it can stay within its budget, even with the additional allotments. [Refer to the San Francisco Administrative Code, Chapter 3 Budget Procedures and Chapter 10 Finance, Taxation, and Other Fiscal Matters, Article 1 In General, Sec. 10.01. Effect of Appropriation Ordinance and Sec. 10.05. Allotments .] What if an unusual situation arose an d my budget will be insufficient for the balance of the year? If this situation arises, contact the Contro ller's Budget Office or the Mayor's Budget Office. With the approval of the Mayor's Office, departments can submit a supplemental appropriation request. The supplemental follows the same route as the budget - recommendation by the Mayor, certification that funds are available by the Controller, approval by the Board of Supervisors, and enactment into law by ordinance. Note that until the Board approves a supplemental a ppropriation request, departments have no authority to incur obligations or over-e xpend funds previously appropriated. Contact the Controller's Budget Office at 554-7554 or the Mayor's Budget Office at 554-6158. What are the rules fo r budget transfers? The San Francisco Administrative Code S ection 3.18 outlines the rules for budget transfers, \"The Controller, upon request of the Mayor, other officials, boards or commissions of the City and County, may transfer any unused balance or portion thereof from previously appropriated funds to augm ent existing appropriations as long as the transfer is within the same fund and governmental section. The Controller shall notify the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors of an y transfer of funds made pursuant to this section that exceeds 10 percent of the original appropriation to which the transfer is made. No such transfer of funds shall be made to an appropriation which was previously reduced by action of either the Mayor or Board of Supervisors in their review of the budget for the current or prior fiscal year.\" What steps do I take to change or enact a new departmental service charge? Fees are typically authorized through the Municipal Code. Please contact the Budget & Analysis Division director, Leo Levenson at 554-4809 for more information. DOING BUSINESS WITH THE CONTROLLER 'SOFFICE A TTACHMENTS PAGE 16 Online departments can verify the need for requests for carryforward by checking ONLINE FAMIS Sub-funds Table Maintenance Screen 5055. If the sub-fund's All- Years Option = N, a request is required. Offline departments should call their Fund Accounting Supervisors for assistance. Employment & Payroll What role does the Controller play in the hiring process? The Controller's Office checks all personnel requisitions to determine that the department has sufficient funds available and an authorized position in the budget. How are employees paid? What do we do in case of a mistake? The Controller's Payroll and Personnel Services Division (PPSD) is responsible for paying approximately 30,000 City employees. City employees are paid biweekly on alternate Tuesdays seven weekdays after the end of the pay period. Biweekly pay periods run from a Saturday through the next following Friday. Example: a pay period could start on Saturday, January 1, run through Frid ay, January 14, with pay issued on Tuesday, January 25. Retirement deductions are cont rolled by the Retirement System; health insurance deductions are controlled by the H ealth Service System; all other deductions, taxes, union dues, etc., are processed through the employee's department to PPSD. Problems with pay, deductions, etc., should be referred to the department payroll clerk, who will refer them to PPSD if necessary. Payroll problems or questions for the San Francisco Community College District or San Francisco Unified School District should be referred to those respective departments. Purchasing How do we make an emergency or urgent purchase immediately? If you need to make an urgent purchase that's within your authorized budget, contact the Purchaser and the Controller's Fund Accounting Supervisor for advice. Administrative Code Section 6.30 specifically defines an \"actual emergency\". In those situations, expenditures require the department head obtain approval in writing from the Mayor and/or the president of the department's board or commission and, if over $25,000, of the Board of Supervisors. Notify the Controller immediately of the work involved or the contract entered into and its estimated cost. Where can I get training on the City's purchasing system? The City's purchasing system is FAMIS Purchasing, which interfaces with FAMIS Accounting. The Controller's Accounting Operations and Systems Division manages ONLINE FAMIS. Department fiscal officers or someone designated by your fiscal officer must authorize training in writing or via e-mail sent through their department's FAMIS Purchasing Liaison. The FAMIS Pu rchasing Liaison emails the pertinent information to the FAMIS Purchasing Help Desk or calls the FAMIS Purchasing Help Line at 554-7878 . Note that access to FAMIS Purchasing is not authorized until the DOING BUSINESS WITH THE CONTROLLER 'SOFFICE A TTACHMENTS PAGE 17 classes are completed. It is advisable to sign up as soon as possible as there are long waiting lists. Where can I find the City's purchasing system manual? The City's FAMIS Purchasing System Training Manual is posted on the Controller's intranet site at: http://www.sfgov.org/site/intranet/?id=34719#purchasing .

III. Appendices AE. Employment Procedures Guidebook City & County of San FranciscoIII. Appendices AF. Labor relations Guidebook City & County of San FranciscoLABOR RELATIONS Collective bargaining for the City's approximately 30,000 employees takes place under the umbrella of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act ( MMBA), our City Charter and our Employee Relations Ordinance. Stat e and local law grants public employees, even managers, the right to unionize and the right to bargain in good faith over matters within the scope of representation. Such matters include wages and benefits, and a broad array of working conditions including work hours, work schedules, workloads, uniforms and equipment, discha rge and disciplinary pr ocedures, workplace safety issues and more. MMBA does not require a public employer to directly bargain core management rights such as the ability to consider and make decisions about the merits, necessity or organization of any service or activity pr ovided by the City. The end result of collective bargaining is a memora ndum of understanding (MOU) that then must be adopted as an ordinance by the Board of Supervisors to become effective. In San Francisco, collective bargaining is centralized for certain purposes and decentralized for others. Wages and significant benefits are primarily policy decisions made by the Mayor's Office and ar e subject to budgeta ry constraints and interest arbitration cr iteria. Working conditions are ofte n determined at the Department level in cooperation with the Employee Rela tions Division (ERD) of the Department of Human Resources (DHR), which has a primary function to maintain the consistency and administer ability of su ch conditions across departmental lines. Retirement benefits are set by the voters a nd administered by the Retirement System. Health benefits are determined primarily through the Health Service Board, though certain aspects are determined through collective bargaining. Core merit system issues such as our classification and examination processes are within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission and are not bargainable at all. Under the Charter, the formal responsi bility for collective bargaining belongs to the Director of Human Resources, who reports directly to the Mayor. Charter section 11.100 provides that \"the Mayor th rough the Human Resources Director or his/her designee and in consultation with the Board of Supervisors shall be responsible for\" labor negotiations. As a practical matter, the responsibil ity for managing labor relations is a collaborative effort between DHR-ERD, the Ci ty Attorney's Office, the Controller's Office, all other City Departments, and of course, the Mayor's Office and the Board of Supervisors. Generally, responsibilities are segregated in the following manner: Mayor's Office - provides primary policy and operat ional direction for bargaining; Board of Supervisors - consults in the labor negotiati on processes; approves labor contracts and arbitration awards; Controller's Office - advises Mayor's Office on budge tary matters; assists DHR- ERD/City Attorney with co sting, research and data; DHR-ERD - represents the City on most collectiv e bargaining subjects and processes; City Attorney's Office - assists DHR-ERD with coordi nation of city-wide labor negotiations; provides chief negotiators, coordination and legal advice; handles arbitrations, drafts and approve s MOUs as to legal form; and n:\\labor\\esalveso\\admin\\labornew.doc 1City Departments - provide input, participate in bargaining, administer contract provisions. MMBA requires public employers to establis h local rules to administer their labor relations programs. The City's local proc edures are found in its Charter and its Employee Relations Ordi nance. The Employee Relations Ordinance establishes a process by which city job cla ssifications are assigne d to bargaining units and allows for employees in each bargai ning unit the right to elect a labor organization to represent them. As a practical matter, most of the City's unions have been around for many years with each repr esenting the following types of employees: Union Union Local or AcronymWork Performed by Represented EmployeesApproximate Number of Employees Represented Key Departments Operating EngineersLocal 3 Craft 54 Airport, DPW, Rec & Park, Water Painters Local 4 Craft 104 Airport, DPW, MTA, Port, DPH, Rec & Park, Water 714 Airport, DBI, DPW, Hetch Hetchy, MTA, Port, Rec & Park, DOT, Water Bricklayers Local 3 Craft 6 Airport, DPW Theatrical Stage Employees Local 16 Craft 16 War Memorial IFPTE, Local 21Local 21 engineers, architects and misc. professional and technical employees 3709 Most Departments Pile Drivers Local 34 Craft 14 Port Hod Carriers Local 36 Craft 6 DPW Plumbers Local 38 Craft 295 DBI, DPW, Fire, Hetch Hetchy, Port, DPH, PUC, Rec & Park, Water Soft Floor CoverersLocal 12 Craft 2 DPW Stationary Local 39 Craft 573 Academy of n:\\labor\\esalveso\\admin\\labornew.doc 2Union Union Local or AcronymWork Performed by Represented EmployeesApproximate Number of Employees Represented Key Departments Engineers Sciences, Airport, Asian, Clean Water, DPW, Fire Hetch Hetchy, Juvenile, MTA, Library, Rec & Park, Sheriff, War Memorial, Water Roofers Local 40 Craft 9 Port, Rec & Park Sheet Metal WorkersLocal 104 Craft 40 Airport, DPW Glaziers Local 718 Craft Services, Airport, Hetch Hetchy, MTA, Port, Water Union of American Physicians and Dentists UAPD Doctors 217 Adult & Aging, Animal Care, Medical Examiner, Police, DPH Transit Workers UnionLocal 200 Investigation, Transport Operators 271 City Attorney, MTA, Police, Library Teamsters Local 853 Truck Drivers 148 Airport, DPW, MTA, Port, DPH, Water Carpenters Local 22 Craft 101 Airport, DPW, Port, DPH, Rec & Park, Water SEIU, Local 1021 (single MOU)Local 1021Miscellaneous, Clerical and Custodial7237 Most Departments Local 1021Health Care Workers 1712 Airport, DHS, Juvenile, Medical Examiner, Performed by Represented EmployeesApproximate Number of Employees Represented Key Departments Nurse SEIU, Local 1021 Fire Rescue ParamedicLocal 1021Fire Rescue Paramedics 12 SFFD Transit Workers Union, Local 250A (Multi) Local250Ax\u0003Miscellaneous x\u0003Auto Service Workers and x\u0003Transit Operators2193 Airport, DPH, Library, Rec & Park, MTA, Police, Library, Water Laborers Local 261 Craft 907 Airport, DPW, Hetch Hetchy, Port, Rec & Park, Water Municipal Attorneys AssociationMAA Attorneys 425 City Attorney, District Attorney & Public Defender Teamsters 350Local 350 Animal Keepers 2 Rec & Park Municipal Executives AssociationMAA Managers 942 Various Depts.

As matters currently exist, labor relations procedures are also contained in five different sections of the Charter. The Char ter generally prohibits City employees from striking. Each section of the Charter specifi es slightly different terms and conditions governing collective bargaining and the applicable impasse resolution procedures. With unique exceptions for nurses and trans it operators, most city labor unions are covered by a section of the Charter that pr ovides for binding inte rest arbitration of impasses. 1. Section A8.403 - Nurses This Charter section governs collective bargaining for nurses employed by San Francisco. It requires the Civil Service Commission to certify to the Board of Supervisors the highest prevailing salary schedule gran ted in collective bargaining to comparable nurses in the adjacent six county area in either the public or private sector. There are two units of nurses established under Section A 8.403, one unit of staff nurses represented by SEIU Local 1021 and another unit of supervis ing nurses represented by Teamsters Local 856. Altogether, approximately 1600 staff nurses and supervisors are represented in these two bargaining units. n:\\labor\\esalveso\\admin\\labornew.doc 52. Section A8.404 - Transit Operators Section A8.404 of the Charter covers the City's transit employees. Section A8.404 requires that the rates of pay for transit employees by set yearly at a rate not less than the average of the two highest wage schedules for transit systems employing at least 400 operators in cities with a population of at least 500,000. The Transportation Workers Union, Local 250-A, represents a bargaining unit of approximately 2,100 transit operators and platform employees under Section A8.404. 3. Section A8.409 - Miscellaneous Employees Section A8.409 applies to all miscellaneous officers and employees and some \"safety employees\" including probation officers and institutional police officers. The section provides for mediation and/or interest arbitration if the parties are unable to reach voluntary agreement at the bargaining table. Several factors are taken into account in arbitration, includi ng the City's financial c ondition, the cost of living, other wage increases recently awarded to City employees, and compensation comparab ility data for employees performing similar work in other public s ector jurisdictions. Altogether, approximately 23,000 employees are covered under this section. 4. Section A8.590 - Safety Employees Section A8.590 applies to police officer s, fire fighters, and deputy sheriffs. Similar to A8.409 in several respects, this sect ion provides that wage rates are to be set through collective bargaining or, if there is an impasse in collective bargaining, through mediation and/or binding interest arbitrati on. Approximately 4300 em ployees are covered under this section. 5. Section 8A.104 \u2014 Service Cr itical Employees at MTA In November 1999, the San Francisco voters approved Proposition E, a Charter amendment that established the Municipal Tr ansportation Agency (\"MTA\" or \"Agency\"). See Charter Section 8A.100 et seq. The Agency is governed by a board of seven directors appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the Board of Supervisors. Unless expressly provided otherwise, the Agency is subject to the requirements of the Charter and is obligated to comply with all of th e restrictions and re quirements imposed by City ordinances. While labor relations procedures remained mostly unchanged for transit operators and other employees at MTA deemed \"service critical\" by that Agency, this section requires that the interest arbitration process, where applicable, contemplate factors unique to the transit industry. In sum, labor relations in the City and County of San Francisco are extremely complex. The Charter, Employee Relations Or dinance, Civil Service Rules and nearly 40 MOUs each play a part in shaping our employees' wages and job benefits.

Appendices AG. Office of Contract Administration Guidebook City & County of San FranciscoGuidebook City & County of San Francisco III. Appendices AG1. Office of Contract Administration 1OFFICE OF CONtrACt ADMINIStrAtION/PUrCHASING Lynn Khaw, OCA the Office of Contract Administration (OCA)/Purchasing is part of the General Services Agency. The office is at City Hall, Room 430, 1 Dr. Carlton B. Goodlett Place, San Francisco, CA 94102. The general office phone number is (415) 554-6743, and the website is at http://www.sfgov.org/oca. Purchasing buys material, equipment, and services for the various departments of the City and County of San Francisco. For most commodities and general services under $10,000, your department may follow the City's procurement process without the assistance of a Purchaser. (See \"Decentralized Purchasing\" for details.) Purchasing does not process public works or improvement contracts.For Professional Services, departments conduct a competitive procurement through a Request-for- Proposal (RFP) process. The RFP must be posted on the Purchasing website, and this process is governed by the rules and regulations promulgated by Purchasing. (See \"Procurement of Commodities and Services.) You may call (415) 554-6743 to determine which Purchaser is assigned to your department or go to Purchasing's website and click on \"List of Buyers and How to Contact Them.\" Please call the assigned Purchaser if you have any questions about procurement. There are five large departments that have Purchasers onsite: Public Utilities Commission, San Francisco International Airport, Municipal Transportation Agency, Department of Public Works and San Francisco General Hospital. PrOCUrEMENt OF COMMODItIES AND SErvICES Commodities are defined as products, including materials, equipment and supplies. Services include general services and professional services. General services are non-professional services. Examples of general services include janitorial, security guard, pest control, parking lot attendants and landscaping services. Examples of professional services are the services of architects, engineers, software developers, consultants and physicians. The City uses competitive bidding processes governed by the Charter, Administrative Code, Environmental Code and other codes. Pertinent Administrative Code sections are: Chapter 21, Acquisition of Commodities and Services; Chapter 12B, Nondiscrimination in Contracts; Chapter 14B, Local Business Enterprise Ordinance; Chapter 12G, Prohibition on Use of Public Funds for Political Activity by Recipients of City Contracts, Grants, and Loans; Chapter 12P, Minimum Compensation Ordinance; Chapter 12Q, Health Care Accountability Ordinance; Chapter 12U, Sweatfree Contracting Ordinance; and Chapter 83, First Source Hiring Program. Pertinent Environmental Code requirements are: Chapter 1, Precautionary Guidebook City & County of San Francisco III. Appendices AG1. Office of Contract Administration 2(Purchasing) Principle; Chapter 5, Resource Conservation; Chapter 8, Tropical Hardwood and Virginia Redwood Ban; and Chapter 13, Arsenic-Treated Wood. Under the Charter and the Administrative Code, the City's general approach to procurement of commodities and services is centralized. This means Purchasing makes purchases on your department's behalf. Additionally, Purchasing consolidates purchases of commodities and general services using term contracts. Term contracts have lower prices, more favorable terms and reduced administrative time in placing orders because the procurement is conducted using citywide buying power. It is a Citywide policy that if items needed by the department are in the term contracts, departments should buy such items from the term contract vendor.. The list of term contracts is d distributed to the contracting officers, buyers, financial personnel, and others Citywide on a monthly basis. If you want a copy, you may request it from Purchasing. Professional services are services that require extended analysis, the exercise of discretion and independent judgment in their performance or the application of an advanced, specialized type of knowledge, expertise or training customarily acquired either by a prolonged course of study or equivalent experience in the field. Examples of professional services include architects, engineers, accountants and non-licensed professionals such as software developers financial and other consultants. Each City department handles its own professional services contracts using the RFP method for formal solicitation. After issuing an RFP and conducting an evaluation, the department makes a recommendation to Purchasing, which then officially awards the contract. Prior to your ordering goods or the vendor rendering any services, funds must be encumbered by the issuance of a purchase order. However, orders below $200 can be placed without a purchase order and paid with a direct voucher. All purchases, even those below $200, must be made from a vendor that complies with all of the City's requirements. Please note that Purchasing does not handle the following types of purchases: travel, training, claims, membership, advertising, postage, subscriptions and utilities. These types of transactions are handled in FAMIS, the City's accounting system.
