Mice Cancer Experiments. 1970-1997. These materials document a set of mice experiments that Cameron carried out in collaboration with Dr. Jeff Bland and Dr. Richard Marcuson that explored the effects of dietary fatty acids on incidences of breast and colon cancers. The serie includes a wide range of records, from experiment proposals and descriptions, to budgets, data sheets, correspondence, manuscripts and related articles. The boxes are arranged according to the stage of a given experiment, with files organized by date, as applicable. 10 boxes 1.001.

This series is comprised of Cameron's collection of scientific offprints, including those written by others and by himself. The materials are further divided into five subseries, each containing articles of various types. Boxes 5.001 to 5.006 include only those articles written by Cameron, the majority of which pertain to Vitamin C. Box 5.007 holds articles both by and about Dr. Linus Pauling, Cameron's major collaborator. Boxes 5.008 to 5.016, which comprise the largest of the subseries, are devoted to scientific articles of all kinds, mainly dealing with Vitamin C and other medical topics, and organized alphabetically by author's last name, or by title in cases where no author is evident. Boxes 5.017 to 5.020 contain articles not published in scientific journals, organized by topic. Many of these topics are of a medical nature, and most of the topic names were derived directly from the organizational scheme of Cameron's own filing cabinets. Boxes 5.021 to 5.023 include periodicals that Cameron received, filed alphabetically by publication name. 32 boxes 5.001.

This series documents Cameron's affiliations with organizations and institutions, including the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine. It is divided into six subseries, each focusing on either a different institution or on other official matters of concern to Cameron, such as research proposals and funding. One subseries is devoted entirely to documents pertaining to grants, the primary source of funding for Cameron's research. Boxes 12.001 to 12.003, which chronicle Cameron's interactions with the Pauling Institute, and boxes 12.004 to 12.005, which contain materials related to the National Foundation for Cancer Research, both include information about the specific institution as well as documents illustrating their affiliation with Cameron and correspondence with various members of each organization. 12 box 12.001.
