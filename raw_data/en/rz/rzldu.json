Some of our capabilities include: - Imaging of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent stains - Live cell imaging - Image annotation - Image analysis of multiplex IHC and fluorescent stains - Morphometric measurements Research pathologists are available for pathology review of stained slides and for annotation of regions of interest for image analysis. Imaging Services - Imaging of human and animal cells and tissues on glass slides - Confocal and light sheet microscopy Imaging Analysis Services - Digital quantification analysis of fluorescence and brightfield images, as well as slide scans with single or multiple probes - Web-based interface to access, view and analyze images StrataQuest Imaris Imaris (Bitplane) is designed to provide automated quantification of fluorescent 3-dimensional image analysis. With the most updated version, iMaris can perform isosurface rendering, object detection/counting, filament tracing/particle tracking, quantitative co-localization and distance measurements that are extremely useful for a variety of biological experiments and applications. iMaris supports most microscope formats on the market including images collected by Zeiss, Leica and Olympus acquisition software. Nanostring GeoMX Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler is a novel platform developed by NanoString. Digital Spatial Profiling is based on nCounter\u00ae barcoding technology and enables a spatially resolved digital readout of up to 96 proteins or RNA targets in a multiplexed assay. The assay relies upon antibody or RNA probes coupled to photocleavable oligonucleotide tags. After simple-step hybridization of probes fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections, the oligonucleotide tags from ROI are released by UV exposure and quantitated in a standard nCounter assay, yielding a spatially resolved digital profile of analyte abundance. Given this novel technology, one can easily generate data from FFPE tissue with multiplex protein/RNA detection, quantitative (nonamplified) readout, and high throughput. - Quantify up to 96 proteins and over 1000 RNA targets with spatial context - Process 10-20 slides/day with readout on the nCounter\u00ae System or with NGS - Preserve precious samples with nondestructive processing Microscopy and Imaging Instrumentation The Biobank and Research Pathology Resource houses some of the most advanced technology available to medical research.
