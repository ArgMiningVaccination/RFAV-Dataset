MCH Timeline: History, Legacy and Resources for Education and Practice Welcome to the MCH Timeline, which traces the history of maternal and child health in the U.S. We hope that it will be used as an orientation tool for those new to the MCH profession, for grantees of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau and MCH trainees and students. We also hope that practicing MCH professionals will regard it as a rich resource and source of inspiration.
