Explanation: This language requires the State fiscal 2024 VOCA awards to be awarded at a level equal to that of fiscal 2023. Priority shall be given to non- State service provi ders. The language restricts $500,000 pending the submission of a report by GOCPYVS detailing how non-State providers were given funding priority and proposed VOCA awards for the fiscal 2024 grant cycle. The language restricts an additional $500,000 pend ing the submission of information for all active VOCA grants as of January 1, 2023. The report should detail whether each of the grant D21 House Appropriations Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 18 recipients received the same level of VOCA funding during the federal fiscal 2022 VOCA grant cycle and the information on each of the grant programs receiving such funds. For each open three- year grant cycle (federal fiscal 2021, 2022, and 2023), GOCPYVS should report the amount of currently unexpended funds, the reason these funds remain unspent, and whether they will be he ld in reserve. The report should provide further detail regarding the expenditure of funds for the two most recently completed funding cycles - federal fiscal 2019 and 2020. The report should provide a comparison of the program's aggregate outcome or perf ormance measure in recent fiscal years. Finally, the report should identify any differences between the legislative appropriation and actual spending levels for each closed out fiscal year, beginning with State fiscal 2017: State fiscal 2017; 2018; 2019; 2020; 2021; 2022; and 2023. For any differences between the authorized and actual spending levels during the aforementioned State fiscal years, the report should identify and discuss the reasons for these disparities.

Amendment No. 8 D26A07 Department of Aging House Appropriations Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 20 Committee Narrative D26A07.01 General Administration Program Participation and Waitlists: Preliminary fiscal 2023 data suggests that during the first half of the fiscal year, waitlists in Senior Care, the Senior Assisted Living Subsidy (SALS), and the Congregate Housing Services Program (CHSP) increased, and participation in each program decreased despite increased funding for each program. The committees are interested in continuing to monitor the waitlists in these programs. The Maryland Department of Aging (MDOA) should submit a report with data as of June 30, 2023, with the following information: the number of individuals on waitlists for Senior Care, SALS, and CHSP in each of the local Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) that provide these services; the number of individuals participating in Senior Care, SALS, and CHSP in each of the local AAAs that provide these services; amount of funding allocated to each local AAA for each program with waitlists (Senior Care, SALS, CHSP) in fiscal 2023; actual local AAA expenditures on each program in fiscal 2023, including funding that may have been realigned between programs; MDOA- approved fiscal 2024 spending plans by jurisdiction for these programs; and strategies MDOA will adopt to support AAAs to reduce waitlists and how fiscal 2024 funding will support these efforts.

The committees request that MCCR submit a report providing the following information: number of individuals by classification that have left the agency fiscal 2020 through the close of fiscal 2023; length of tenure in dates; analysis of the reasons given by employee for leaving, if available; number of these individuals by fiscal year leaving the agency that took a comparable position, if available; and description of recruitment and retention efforts undertaken in fiscal 2022.

The eight Pimlico MOUs are those identified in the MSA Report on the Pimlico and Laurel Park Facilities Redevelopment as required by HB 897 submitted to the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee, the House Appropriations Committee, and the House Ways and Means Committee on January 1, 2023. Further provided that MSA will report to the budget committees on the status of the Pimlico MOUs by October 27, 2023. This report should include an updated schedule that outlines key planning, construction, and financing milestones for Pimlico and Laurel Park. Explanation: Chapter 590 of 2020 created the Racing and Community Development Financing Fund to support improvements to the Pimlico and Laurel Park. When the legislation was enacted, Laurel Park was expected to be completed in 2022 so that racing could begin in February 2023. The project is three years behind schedule as no agreements have been signed and no design or construction has begun. MSA, in its January 1, 2023 report, noted that only one of the eight MOUs for Pimlico has been completed. The fund's debt service payments are supported by $17 million annually in lottery revenues. Increased interes t rates since 2020 have reduced the proceeds expected from these bonds. Construction inflation and increasing the scope beyond what was authorized in 2020 have increased costs. MSA estimates that available funds to renovate the facilities, as proposed by the expanded scope, are $160 million to $350 million less than available resources. The expectation is that the State will have to fund this, leaving less resources for other priorities. Further delays could further erode the value of the bonds and add to costs through increased inflation and an expanded scope. This contingent language requires MSA to enter into MOUs by September 30, 2023, and is intended to encourage the parties to enter into MOUs and keep State costs down. The language also requires a report by MSA on or before October 27, 2023.

Funds not expended shall revert to the General Fund. Explanation: This language restricts the general funds appropriated for Assistance Payments, which support public benefit programs administered by the Department of Human Services, to that use only. Thi s restriction prevents a transfer of general funds to other programs. This language is consistent with actions on other entitlement programs. Amendment No. Amend appropriation for the purposes indicated: Funds 1. Reduce funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) due to lower anticipated benefit levels. The fiscal 2024 allowance assumes average benefits will increase despite the end of Emergency Allotments, which have increased benefits on average by $170 per month a ccording to the Department of Human Services. This reduction still provides funding beyond what is currently expected to be required for SNAP benefits to support program needs if caseloads rise and to provide appropriation if needed for the new federal Sum mer Electronic Benefit Transfer program and Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer benefits that may be issued in fiscal 2024. Federal funds not needed to issue benefits for SNAP are not received from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. -100,000,000 FF Total Change -100,000,000 63 N00G00 House Appropriations Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 110 Effect Allowance Appropriation Amount Change General Fund 118,997,860 118,997,860 0 Special Fund 15,601,225 15,601,225 -100,000,000 Total Funds 2,467,281,616 2,367,281,616 -100,000,000 Amendment No. Committee Narrative Application Processing Times, Denials, and Case Closures: The committees remain interested in tracking the timeliness of application processing as well as reasons for denials and case closures.

Funds restricted pending the receipt of a report may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any other purpose and shall revert to the General Fund if the report is not submitted to the budget committees. Explanation: Excessive overtime has become a drain on human resources in the department and led to a riskier work environment for State employees, offenders, and volunteers. The amounts have trended steeply since the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS) has struggled to fill correctional officer positions. Assaults are also on the rise, particularly in detention facilities. There have also been systemic errors in accounting for overtime that led to an ongoing U.S. Department of Labor investigation into unpaid wages.

R62I00 House Appropriations Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 153 Information Request Report on best practices and annual progress toward the 55% completion goal Author MHEC Due Date December 15, 2023 Report on Nontraditional Pathways: Nationally, nontraditional students, those 25 years and older, compromise approximately 40% of undergraduate students and, according to the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC), these students account for about one -third of undergraduates in community colleges and the public four -year institutions. While there is no standard definition of a nontraditional student, age is often used as a defining characteristic of this population. Nontraditional students face different obstacles than traditional stu dents in obtaining a college education such as having to balance school, work, and life. In order to grow enrollment, institutions will need to develop programs and initiatives targeting this population to help it succeed. MHEC will work with the University System of Maryland (USM) and the Maryland Association of Community Colleges to develop a strategy to strengthen pathways for nontraditional students. MHEC intends to use the $5 million provided in the fiscal 2024 budget to provide grants to USM instituti ons and community colleges to execute the strategy.

This method has created a system where the two grants are competing for the same limited amount of dollars, leadin g to some students not receiving grants. Eligible applicants of the EA grant are put on a waitlist and are awarded grants based on need and the funding available. The committees request a report on to the cost to fully fund the two grants separately as wel l as eliminate the EA waitlist.

By focusing on these faculty, the committees gain a sense of the teaching activities for the regular core faculty. However, there are other types of instructional faculty at institutions, such as full - and part -time nontenured/nontenure -t rack faculty including adjunct faculty, instructors, and lecturers. Focusing on only tenured/tenure -track faculty provides an incomplete picture of how students are taught. Therefore, the report should also include the instructional workload when all types of faculty are considered. Additional information may be included at the institution's discretion. Furthermore, the USM report should include the percent of faculty meeting or exceeding teaching standards for tenured/tenure -track faculty for the University of Maryland, Baltimore Campus. Information Request Annual report on faculty workload Author USM MSU SMCM Due Date December 11, 2023 Report on Programs to Foster Equitable Growth in the Cannabis Industry: Beginning in July 2023, Marylanders will be able to purchase recreational marijuana. With this new industry there is an education gap in not only providing those with knowledge and skills needed to work in industry, but also more research needs to be conducted about cannabis.

Funds restricted pending the receipt of the report may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any other purpose and shall revert to the General Fund if the report is not submitted to the budget committees. Explanation: This action restricts funding pending the submission by November 1, 2023, of the Maryland Scrap Tire Annual Report. Section 9- 275(c) of the Environment Article specifies that an annual status report is due on or before November 1 of each year, which was not consistently met before the inclusion of annual budget bill language. Information Request Maryland Used Tire Cleanup and Recycling Fund annual report Author Maryland Department of the Environment Due Date November 1, 2023 Amendment No. Committee Narrative AIR AND RADIATION ADMINISTRATION U00A07.01 Air and Radiation Administration Ambient Air Monitoring Report: The committees are interested in what is needed to deploy an ambient air monitoring network across the State and how this would improve public health. Therefore, the committees request that the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) submit a report on what is needed to deploy an ambient air monitoring network across the State. In addition, the report is requested to include information on how the data collected from a network would mitigate exposure to toxic pollutants, inform permit decision -making processes, 92 U00A House Appropriations Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 168 and help reduce the cumulative impacts of pollutants such as particulate matter and fine particulate matter. The report is requested to be submitted to the committees by December 31, 2023. Information Request Ambient air monitoring report Author MDE Due Date December 31, 2023 Budget Amendments COORDINATING OFFICES U00A10.01 Coordinating Offices Add the following language to the general fund appropriation: , provided that $200,000 of this appropriation made for the purpose of general administrative expenses may not be expended until the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), in cooperation with the Department of Budget and Management, submits a confir matory letter to the budget committees indicating that MDE's fiscal 2023 actual personnel expenditures and the fiscal 2024 working appropriation personnel expenditures are budgeted in the correct statewide subobjects. The confirmatory letter shall be submitted with the fiscal 2025 budget submission, and the budget committees shall have 45 days from the date of the receipt of the confirmatory letter to review and comment. Funds restricted pending the receipt of a confirmatory letter may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any other purpose and shall revert to the General Fund if the confirmatory letter is not submitted to the budget committees. Explanation: For the second year in a row, MDE's most recent actual fiscal year budget data incorrectly reflects the allocation of funding for personnel expenditures. The 2021 Joint Chairmen's Report included committee narrative requesting that the fiscal 2021 budget data be correctly reflected with the fiscal 2023 budget submission. Then, fiscal 20 23 budget bill language restricted funding pending the submission of a confirmatory letter with the fiscal 2024 budget submission, indicating that prior year actual personnel expenditures up to and including fiscal 2022 are budgeted in the correct statewide subobjects. The fringe benefit expenditures - health insurance, pension contributions, and turnover adjustments, among others - are almost entirely reflected as Social Security contributions, which makes it difficult to do historical data comparisons. In addition, MDE budgets in its working appropriation a portion of its personnel expenditures in a subobject used as a temporary placeholder, miscellaneous adjustments, which makes it difficult to compare the working appropriation with the Governor's allowance. Therefore, increased funding is restricted until MDE and the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) submit a confirmatory letter with the fiscal 2025 budget submission indicating that fiscal 2023 actual personnel expenditures and fiscal 2024 working appropriation personnel expenditures are budgeted in the correct statewide subobjects. U00A House Appropriations Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 169 Information Request Budgeting of fiscal 2023 actual and fiscal 2024 working appropriation personnel expenditures Author MDE DBM Due Date Fiscal 2025 budget submission Amendment No. Add the following language to the general fund appropriation: Further provided that $100,000 of this appropriation made for the purpose of general operating expenses may not be expended until the Maryland Department of the Environment submits a report to the budget committees on revised fee structures for the fees that support the Maryland Clean Water Fund, the Lead Poisoning Prevention Fund, and the Maryland Clean Air Fund to ensure that the special funds can adequately support the Water and Science Administration, the Land and Materials Administration, and the Air and Radiation Administration, respectively, and to reduce the need for general fund support. The report shall include the following: (1) a d escription of who pays each fee; (2) a description of how the revenue for each fee is used; (3) whether each fee is recurring or one time; (4) the volume of payors and revenue for each year since each fee was last increased; (5) an explanation for any significant changes in the revenues received from each fee, including, but not limited to, changes in the number of payors or amount paid by each payor; (6) a comparison of Maryland to other peer states in terms of how the functions supported by each fee are handled; (7) the size of each of the special fund sh ortfalls now and a projection of each of the special fund shortfalls into the future; and (8) an analysis of how much of each of the special fund shortfalls would have been addressed by indexing each fee to inflation. The report shall be submitted by Septemb er 29, 2023, and the budget committees shall have 45 days from the date of the receipt of the report to review and comment. Funds restricted pending the receipt of a report may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any 93 U00A House Appropriations Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 170 other purpose and sh all revert to the General Fund if the report is not submitted to the budget committees. Explanation: Fiscal 2023 general fund deficiency appropriations of $1.5 million are budgeted in each of the Water and Science Administration, the Land and Materials A dministration, and the Air and Radiation Administration to counter declining special fund revenue. This is the fourth fiscal year in which funding has been provided for declining special fund revenue in at least one of the Maryland Department of the Environment's (MDE) administrations. According to the polluter pays principle, a core tenant of environmental law and environmental economics, social welfare is maximized when all costs - environmental, social, and actual - are reflected in prices. This is not occurring because of outdated fee structures for the special funds supporting the three administrations: Maryland Clean Water Fund; Lead Poisoning Prevention Fund; and Maryland Clean Air Fund. Therefore, this budget bill language restricts funding pending the submission of a report on revised fee structures for the fees supporting these three special funds by September 29, 2023.

The study should include information about the relevancy of the national Emergency Alert System to the proposed text alert system and an evaluation of the type of environmental events or accidents that would be most beneficial to include in such a system.

Though data contributors were able to provide the department with 2021 crime data, there have been delays in compiling the 2021 UCR due to the inability for all contributors to submit it in compliance with the new federal reporting system. The 2021 UCR is not expected to be published until mid-March 2023. This language withholds a portion of the general fund appropriation until the budget committees receive the 2021 UCR. The language also specifies that GOCPYVS, upon receipt of notification from DSP, must withhold a portion of a delinquent jurisdiction's SAPP grant until certain crime data is received by DSP. Finally, DSP and GOCPYVS mus t submit a report to the budget committees that includes information on any jurisdiction that did not report crime data by November 1, 2023, and the amount of SAPP funding that is withheld from each jurisdiction.
