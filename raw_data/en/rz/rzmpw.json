You can contact me or book a treatment using the info below. Body therapy is an effective treatment of body and mind in order to provide relief and reduce tension and pain from physical and psychological conditions. It is achieved through pulsating movements, massage, breathing exercises, acupuncture and zone therapy, body manipulation, and body positioning. Body therapy can take many forms, but overall it is a holistic approach focusing on the connection between body and mind. I am a Totum Body Therapist, and looks at body and mind as a unity, and how our mental state is reflected in our body and vice versa. As an example, if you have experienced being stressed, you probably felt it physically as shallow breathing, stomach pain, or tensions in your neck and shoulders. This is the body reacting to your mental state and trying to alarm you that something is not right, and that you should stop and listen to these signals. The treatment of your body is to reduce pain and help improve your health and overall wellbeing. The treatment can both be focused on muscle tension and pain relief and/or have a more psychological approach for stress, depression and trauma release. Mind and body is connected and therefore I will treat it as a whole and help you get balanced. No one should live a life with pain as there's always a way to improve your health. Let's do it together. The experiences and feelings you have through your life can settle in the body and create tensions or pain if they are not dealt with and released. Be it stress, anxiety, sorrow, worries, lack of confidence, a traumatic experience or feelings you have not been able to express. As a body therapist I work with the tensions and pain through both physical treatment and therapeutic conversation. Through the treatment you become more aware of the connection between your body and mind, and how physical release of tensions and pain can also release suppressed feelings and give insight about yourself. Defense patterns or simply reaction patterns. The body remembers unpleasant experiences we have been through, and this will influence the way we act, because on a conscious or unconscious level, we want to avoid these situations again. This can influence the way we are with other people, the way we make our close relations to those we care about, and the way we react when we are under pressure or hurt. These defense patterns or reaction patterns can be more or less beneficial, and even limit the way we live our lives. Body therapy is an effective and self-loving way of becoming more aware of the reaction patterns that are limiting and holding you back from living your life the way you want.
