Although they can happen to anyone at any time, men are more frequently affected by these kinds of injuries. These are the injuries of the spine that occurred from a sprain, fracture, accidental damage or can stem from medical conditions like arthritis, fibromyalgia, etc. Although these injuries are majorly beyond our control, there are specific safety measures that one can take to avoid injuries to the spine. - Safety first: While indulging in any activity or sport that can cause injury to the spine, one must try to be as secure as possible.

Spinal injury patients need to be stabilised and entirely secured before they are transferred to the hospital. Trying to lift these patients in arms with a dangling neck and flexing of their spine or trying to pull them out can cause more damaging injuries. Seeking expert help at the right time will help one to avoid further damage. - Take your pills: As you grow, older bones become weak and osteoporosis sets in.
