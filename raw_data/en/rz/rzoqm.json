Progression Grades and progress of each student are reviewed by the associate dean at the end of each grading period. Students who do not meet established criteria will be notified. Progression in the baccalaureate program requires a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 in all required nursing courses at the upper division. If a student makes a grade of \"D\" or \"F\" in a nursing course, the course may be repeated once, provided the overall GPA is 2.0. If a student repeats a failed nursing course and does not make a grade of \"C\" or better, the student will be dismissed from the program. Only one nursing course may be repeated. If a student receives a grade of \"D\" or \"F\" in a second nursing course, the student will be dismissed from the program.
