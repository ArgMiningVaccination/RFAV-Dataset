Small, hair-like thin needles are placed on specific parts of the body to create a response from the nervous system. Acupuncture works to reduce pain, calm inflammation, release endorphins and more. Take a deeper dive into symptoms and side effects that acupuncture can address here. Herbal Medicine Chinese Herbal Medicine is a principle branch of treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine. It can be used alone as a treatment method or in conjunction with acupuncture and food therapy to help correct imbalances and promote wellness. Chinese herbs are formulated and custom blended for each individual. Food Therapy Food therapy allows for patients to start with the basics and take their treatment into their own hands. From an Eastern medicine perspective, food is used as medicine. Individual food therapy suggestions support the body, treat symptoms and encourage optimal physical and mental function. Tuina and Cupping Therapy Tuina and Cupping Therapy are used in order to support musculoskeletal disorders as well as internal concerns. Tuina is a form of Asian bodywork most closely resembling conventional western massage, focusing on a specific probelm area of the body. Tuina treatments can be especially effective for chronic pain of the muscles, joints and skeletal system. Cupping Therapy consists of either glass, plastic or silicon cups applied to the body to create a negative pressure/partial vacuum. The technique increases blood circulation to the area in order to release tight fascia and muscles. Cupping is also used for lung concerns, coughing, phlegm and chest tightness, for digestive issues like constipation and for stress and anxiety. Biomedical Sciences It is vital for your practitioner to understand your diagnosis through the lens of Traditional Chinese medicine but also Western medicine. Having a thorough understanding of biomedical diagnostics, pathophysiology, bloodwork and implications of your health status is incredibly important when we develop your treatment plan. Mind-Body Support The practice of breath work, meditation, qi gong, tai chi and other movement recommendations will be a part of the treatment plan. Developing a connection between the mind and body is instrumental in continued care. Mind-body support encourages a balance between stillness and movement and allows for harmony from the inside, out.
