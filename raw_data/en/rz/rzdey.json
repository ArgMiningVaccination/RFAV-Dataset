The history and objectives of the proposal are set forth in the preamble to the Part 940 proposal, and interstate conveyances are specifically dealt with in \u00a7 940.94 of that proposal. Interested persons may, on or before December 30, 1974, file with the Hearing Clerk, Food and Drug Administration, Room 4-65, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852, written comments (preferably in quintuplicate) regarding this proposal. Comments may be accompanied by a memorandum or brief in support thereof. Received comments may be seen in the above office during working hours, Mon\u00ad day through Friday. Dated: September 24, 1974. Sam D. Fin e, Associate Commissioner for Compliance. [FR Doc.74-22578 Filed 9-30-74;8:45 am] [2 1 CFR Part 940] FOOD SERVICE SANITATION Proposed Uniform Requirements for State and Local Regulatory Agencies Over the past 40 years, the Public Health Service has provided assistance to State and local health agencies in the establishment and maintenance of food sanitation programs for food service establishments within their jurisdictions, pursuant to the provisions of the Public Health Service Act. This assistance has included the distribution of a model ordinance for use by State and local gov\u00ad ernments in drafting legislation for the regulation of food service establishments. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act also obligates the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate food held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce. The FDA has recognized the primary jurisdiction of State and local governments over food service establish\u00ad ments and has therefore concentrated its regulatory efforts on assuring the safety and sanitation of food up to the point when it reaches such establishments. It is estimated that there are approxi\u00ad mately 600,000 food service establish\u00ad ments in the United States serving about 150 million meals daily. It is apparent that the FDA could neither inspect nor regulate more than an insignificant por\u00ad tion of these establishments. The pri-PROPOSED RULES mary burden for regulation of food serv\u00ad ice establishments must therefore re\u00ad main with State and local agencies. The potential for foodborne illness re\u00ad sults from many types of insanitary food handling operations in food service establishments. Research indicates that microbiological contamination of foods may occur from raw materials which contain salmonella or other organisms and which, if improperly handled, cause foodborne ilness. The presence of staph\u00ad ylococcal organisms in the throat and on the hands of food handlers and in nonpotable water supplies contributes to the contamination of the environment, and thus can cause illness. Since food\u00ad borne illness can be prevented by follow\u00ad ing good sanitation practices, it is impor\u00ad tant to enumerate such practices for the protection of the public health. Back\u00ad ground materials supporting the need for this proposed food service sanitation regulation are on public display in the office of the Hearing Clerk, Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-65, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852. The last revision of the model ordi\u00ad nance occurred in 1962, when it was pub\u00ad lished as Part V of the Public Health Service \"Food Service Sanitation Man- \" ual.\" Following publication of the 1962 manual, 29 States and approximately 230 local governments utilized the model ordinance as the basis of their laws and regulations. In June 1969, the responsibility to pro\u00ad vide assistance to State and local regula\u00ad tory agencies in the establishment and maintenance of food service sanitation programs was transferred to the Food and Drug Administration (21 CFR 2.120) from another unit of the Public Health Service. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs concludes that there is a need to revise the model ordinance. An updated model ordinance and new Federal regulations provide State and local governments with an up-to-date reference tool which will enhance the goal of greater uniformity in Federal, State, and local regulation. In a number of cases, food service sanita\u00ad tion requirements established by the various State or local regulatory agen\u00ad cies remain varied. With the trend toward national chain and multi-unit franchise operators, who may have busi\u00ad nesses in two or more regulatory juris\u00ad dictions, it has become evident that if State and local enforcement agencies would adopt uniform requirements known and understood by the regulated industry, and carry out these require\u00ad ments through strict enforcement, both the consumer and food service industry would benefit. The food service operator would have a thorough knowledge of what is expected of him, regardless of the location of his business, and could more readily comply with requirements. Section 301(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits adul\u00ad teration of food while held for sale after interstate shipment, and thus includes food service sanitation. In addition to implementing this provision of the law,these new Federal regulations will serve the special purpose of establishing cri\u00ad teria for approval of food service opera\u00ad tions on interstate conveyances and also of food sources for interstate convey\u00ad ances. At present, interstate conveyances may serve food only from sources deter\u00ad mined to be in compliance with the re\u00ad quirements of \u00a7\u00a7 72.161 through 72.174 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regu\u00ad lations. Part 940 of Title 21, as proposed herein, will supersede the requirements of those sections and serve as a basis for approving suppliers ; a proposal to revoke 42 CFR 72.161 through 72.174 appears elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . The model ordinance and Federal reg\u00ad ulations must, of course, be identical. Late in 1972, a draft revision of the model ordinance was developed, and 450 copies were distributed to the States, the organized restaurant industry, and some local regulatory agencies and other interested persons, requesting review and comment. One hundred twenty-five com\u00ad ments were received, including over 1,000 suggestions relating to technical pro\u00ad visions, as well as other suggestions re\u00ad lating to semantics and format. Copies of these comments are on public display in the office of the Hearing Clerk. The Commissioner has given careful con\u00ad sideration to this expert advice and is now prepared to propose for public com\u00ad ment new regulations governing food service sanitation, which will also serve as a Food Service Sanitation Model Ordi\u00ad nance. The purpose of the proposed regular tions and model ordinance is to provide food service establishments with stand\u00ad ards, and State and local governments with a comprehensive model law for the regulations of food service sanitation. Accordingly, comments are requested not only on the substance of the pro\u00ad posed requirements but also in regard to possible changes which might facilitate adoption by State and local governments. The Commissioner recognizes that two aspects of the model ordinance are in\u00ad appropriate for inclusion in the proposed new Federal regulations. The provisions dealing with captions, repealer, and separability (found in sections 1-103, 1-104, and 1-105 of the model ordi\u00ad nance), and large portions of the en\u00ad forcement provisions dealing with per\u00ad mits, inspections, and review of plans (found in chapter 10 of the model ordi\u00ad nance) are properly included only in a model ordinance for State and local gov\u00ad ernments. The Commissioner has placed on display in the office of the Hearing Clerk a revised Model Food Service Sani\u00ad tation Ordinance, which' contains these provisions in addition to all of the pro\u00ad visions set out in the proposed Federal regulations except for \u00a7 940.94 which deals with interstate conveyances. Copies may be obtained upon request and comments are requested upon the provisions that appear only in the pro\u00ad posed model ordinance as well as on the provisions appearing in the proposed Federal regulations. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 PROPOSED RULES 35439 The final Federal regulations will be published in a new Subchapter I\u2014Fed\u00ad eral State Cooperative Programs, Part 9 4 0 , of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. It will also be available as a model ordinance in a revised \"Food Service Sanitation Manual\" from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washing\u00ad ton, DC 20402. The manual will continue to provide additional material not appropriate for publication as a final order in the Code of Federal R\u00e9gula\u00ad tions, e.g., history of the regulation of food servic\u00e8 sanitation, discussion of changing patterns in American food consumption, discussion of scientific rationale for provisions, bibliographical material for research on food sanitation, etc. Therefore, pursuant to the provisions of the Public Health Service Act (secs. 3 0 1 , 311, 361, 58 Stat. 691, 693, 703, as amended; (42 U.S.C. 241, 243, 264) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos\u00ad metic Act (secs. 402, 701, 52 Stat. 1046- 4 7 , 1055-1056, as amended; (21 U.S.C. 3 4 2 , and under authority delegated to him (21 CFR 2.120), the Commissioner proposes to add a new Part 940, Subchapter I\u2014Federal-State Coopera\u00ad tive Programs, to Title 21, as follows: PART 940\u2014 FOOD SERVICE SANITATION Subpart A\u2014 General Provisions Sec. 940 .1 Purpose. 940 .3 Definitions.

Food may be examined or sampled by the Food and Drug Administration as often as necessary for enforcement of this part. The Food and Drug Adminis\u00ad tration may, upon written notice to the owner or person in charge specifying with particularity the reasons therefor, place a hold order on any food which it believes is in violation of \u00a7 940.10 or any other section of this part. The Food and Drug Administration shall tag, label, or otherwise identify any food subject to the hold order. No food subject to a hold order shall be used, served, or moved from the establishment. The Food and Drug Administration shall permit stor\u00ad age of the food under conditions speci\u00ad fied in the hold order, unless storage is not possible without risk to the public health, in which case immediate de\u00ad struction shall be ordered and ac\u00ad complished. The hold order shall state that a request for hearing may be filed within 10 days and that if no hearing is requested the food shall be destroyed. A hearing shall be held if so requested, and on the basis of evidence produced at that hearing, the hold order may be vacated or the owner or person in charge of the food may be directed by written order to denature or destroy such food or to bring it into compliance with the pro\u00ad visions of this part. \u00a7 940.93 Procedure when infection is suspected. When the Food and Drug Administra\u00ad tion has reasonable cause to suspect possibility of disease transmission from any food service establishment employee, it may secure a morbidity history of thesuspected employee or make any other investigation as may be indicated and shall take appropriate action. The Food and Drug Administration may require any or all of the following measures: (a) The immediate exclusion of the employee from all food service establish\u00ad ments; (b) The immediate closing of the food service establishment concerned until, in the opinion of the Food and Drug Ad\u00ad ministration, no further danger of dis\u00ad ease outbreak exists; (c) Restriction of the employee's serv\u00ad ices to some area of the establishment where there would be no danger of trans\u00ad mitting disease; (d) Adequate medical and laboratory examinations of the employee, of other employees, and of his and their body discharges. \u00a7 940.94 Food service operations and food sources of interstate convey\u00ad ances. (a) No conveyance engaged in inter\u00ad state traffic shall operate as a food serv\u00ad ice establishment nor shall it serve food obtained from a food service establish\u00ad ment unless the Food and Drug Admin\u00ad istration has determined that: (1) The establishment is in compliance with the requirements of this part; or (2) The rating score of the establish\u00ad ment, determined in accordance with the provisions of this part, is greater than 70, and the establishment is making ade\u00ad quate efforts to achieve compliance with the requirements of this part. (b) As used in this section, \"interstate traffic\" means the movement of any con\u00ad veyance or the transportation of persons or property, including any portion ofsuch movement or transportation which is entirely within a State or possession, (1) from a point of origin in any State or possession to a point of destination in any other State or possession, or (2) be\u00ad tween a point of origin and a point of destination in the same State or posses\u00ad sion but through any other State, posses\u00ad sion, or foreign country. (c) The operator of a conveyance which proposes to use a food service establishment as a source of its food shall request the Food and Drug Administra\u00ad tion to determine whether food may be obtained from that establishment for use in interstate traffic. The Food and Drug Administration shall make that deter\u00ad mination, and it may rely on an inspec\u00ad tion by a State inspector in so doing. (d) Upon request of the Food and Drug Administration, operators of con\u00ad veyances engaged in interstate traffic shall identify the vendors, distributors, and dealers from whom they have ac\u00ad quired or are acquiring their food sup\u00ad plies. Interested persons may, on or before December 30, 1974, file with the Hearing Clerk, Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-65, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20852, written comments (preferably in quintuplicate) regarding this proposal. Comments may be accompanied by a memorandum or brief in support thereof. Received comments may be seen in the above office during working hours, Mon\u00ad day through Friday.

[FR Doc.74-22577 Filed 9-30-74;8:45 am] FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER \u00bb, 1974 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 WASHINGTON, D.C. Volume 39 Number 191 PART III DEPARTMENT O F TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration AIRCRAFT ENGINES Airworthiness Standards for Installation and Type Certification 35452 Title 14\u2014 Aeronautics and Space CHAPTER I\u2014 FEDERAL AIRCRAFT ENGINES\u2014 CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES AND TYPE CERTIFICATION STANDARDS The purpose of these amendments is to change the procedural requirements relating to the type certification of air\u00ad craft and aircraft engines, to update and improve the airworthiness standards ap\u00ad plicable to the type certification of air\u00ad craft engines, and to incorporate new standards applicable to engines used on supersonic airplanes. In addition, other new airworthiness standards are made applicable to aircraft on which engines type certificated to previous standards are to be installed. These amendments are based on the notice of proposed rulemaking (Notice No. 71-12) published in the Federal Register on May 5, 1971 (36 FR 8383). Except for minor editorial changes, and except as specifically discussed herein\u00ad after, these amendments and. the reasons therefor are the same as those proposed in Notice 71-12. Numerous comments relating to these proposals were received in response to the notice and except for those indicating agreement or merely repeating issues discussed and disposed of in the notice, the FAA's disposition of the significant comments is discussed be\u00ad low. In general, comments received that were beyond the scope of the notice are not discussed but will be retained for consideration in connection with other rulemaking projects as appropriate. Rased on the relevant comments and upon further review- within the FAA, a number of changes have been made to the proposed rules. In addition, various non-substantive changes of a clarifying and editorial nature have been made. Since these changes impose no additional burden on any person, they may be adopted without further notice and public procedure. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of these amendments, and due consideration has been given to all mat\u00ad ter presented. Two of the proposals of the original notice concerning engine rotor system unbalance (\u00a7\u00a7 25.1305 and 33.29) have been implemented by a separate rule- making action, Amendments 25-35 and 33-5, effective March 1, 1974, that were published in the Federal Register on January 15, 1974 (39 FR 1831). The following discussion is keyed to the like-numbered proposals contained in Notice No. 71-12 : Part 1\u2014 D e f in it io n s and Abbreviations Proposal 1 \u2014One commentator objected to the inclusion of a turbosupercharger as part of the engine in the proposed definition of aircraft engines in \u00a7 1.1, asserting that in some instances it shouldRULES AND REGULATIONS be classified as an accessory. However, the intent of the proposal was that turbosuperchargers be included as part of the engine whether or not they are additionally classified as accessories. The definition as adopted has been revised to clarify that a turbosupercharger is part of an engine whether or not it is also an appurtenance or an accessory. . Proposal 2 \u2014Several commentators sug\u00ad gested that the term \"stop\"' be deleted from the definition of \"idle thrust\" as proposed in \u00a7 i.l since a stop is normally associated with the power control lever or throttle, rather than with the engine fuel control device as suggested in the notice. The FAA agrees with the com\u00ad ment to the extent that the term \"idle thrust\" should be related to the power control lever and has changed the defini\u00ad tion by replacing the term \"fuel control device\" with \"power control lever.\" Since the term \"stop\" is appropriate with this revision, it need not be deleted. One commentator pointed out that several of the proposed amendments used the term \"type\" in reference to engines and that the word \"type\" was defined in relation to aircraft in \u00a7 1.1 but not to engines. For internal consistency, the definition of \"type\" has been amended to include the meaning of the term with respect to the certification of aircraft engines. Part 21\u2014 C e r tificatio n Procedures for Products and Parts Proposal 1 \u2014Several commentators sug\u00ad gested that the stress analysis called for in proposed \u00a7 21.15(c) for the engine rotor, spacer, and rotor shaft would not normally be available at the time of ap\u00ad plication for a type certificate, but would be available before actual certification. The FAA agrees and, upon further con\u00ad sideration, has determined that inclusion of the requirement under the type certifi\u00ad cation standards will allow an applicant to complete and submit a stress analysis after application for a type certificate and before certification. \"The require\u00ad ment for a stress analysis has therefore been removed from \u00a7 21.15(c) and relo\u00ad cated in a new \u00a7 33.62 under the design and construction requirements for tur-. bine aircraft engines. Proposal 2 \u2014Several commentators rec\u00ad ommended deletion of that portion of the proposed \u00a7 21.35(f) which requires 300 hours of flight test operations for air\u00ad craft incorporating engines of a type not previously used in a type certificated air\u00ad craft. They contended that the rule dis\u00ad criminated against new engine types, and that unnecessary economic hardships and delays in the aircraft certification program would be imposed. However, ex\u00ad perience with newly certificated engine types has demonstrated to the FAA that there is a need for more thorough flight testing of newly certificated engine types, and the regulation with respect to hours of operation is adopted as proposed. Fur\u00ad thermore, the suggestion of one com\u00ad mentator that allowance be made for the use of experimental engines that differonly in minor ways from the type certif\u00ad icated engine has not been adopted be\u00ad cause the FAA believes it could lead to uneven administration of the rule. One commentator questioned whether th\u00e8 phrase \"engines that conform to a type certificate\" in subparagraph (f) (1) required just one or a full complement of the newly type certificated engines in a multi-engine aircraft. As indicated in the explanation in the Notice, the intent of the FAA is that \"engines\" means all the engines in the aircraft. To eliminate any ambiguity, the wording has been changed to specifically call for a full complement of engines. Proposal 3 \u2014No public comment was received on the proposal to amend \u00a7 21.97 and the section is adopted as proposed. Part 23\u2014 Air w o r t h in e s s S tandards : Norm al , Ut il it y , and Acrobatic Cat\u00ad egory Air planes Proposal 1 \u2014 One commentator ques\u00ad tioned whether proposed \u00a7 23.951(b) would prohibit several fuel tanks from gravity feeding through non-return valves to a single collector box from which the fuel pumps would draw fuel. Such an arrangement is not prohibited and the rule would allow any combina\u00ad tion of tanks to be used so long as means are taken to prevent air from being introduced into the system. In response to the suggestion contained in several comments, the icing require\u00ad ment of paragraph (c) of proposed \u00a7 23.- 951 has been reworded to clarify that it is applicable solely to turbine engine air\u00ad craft, since fuel icing is peculiar to tur\u00ad bine fuels. Additionally, since the re\u00ad quirement is intended to preclude inter\u00ad rupted functioning of the fuel system rather than to require operation for an indefinite time, the rule has been re\u00ad vised to require \"sustained\" operation rather than \"continuous\" operation. Proposal 2 \u2014Several commentators questioned whether an applicant would have to comply with amended \u00a7 23.997 as proposed, if the similar rule in \u00a7 33.67 had already been complied with by the engine manufacturer. The FAA proposed the new requirements to assure that newly certificated aircraft would meet the standards prescribed in \u00a7 33.67. Thus, if the aircraft manufacturer incorpo\u00ad rated an engine which had been type certificated under new \u00a7 33.67 the fuel system would already conform to the rule and nothing further would be re\u00ad quired. If, however, the aircraft manu\u00ad facturer incorporated an engine which had not been certificated under the new \u00a7 33.67 he would have to take the neces\u00ad sary action to comply with new \u00a7 23.997. Several commentators questioned whether the proposed rule would require that each and every filter in the fuel system, including small screens and so- called \"last chance filters,\" meet the re\u00ad quirements of paragraph (a) through (d) of proposed \u00a7 23.997. The FAA in\u00ad tended that at least one filter upstream of the fuel metering device and the en\u00ad gine driven displacement pump meet FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 3 ?, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 RULES AND REGULATIONS 35453 these requirements, and the section has been clarified accordingly. In response to a question raised by one commentator concerned with the avail\u00ad ability of heat for the required filter or strainer, the FAA wishes to point out that the requirement for icing protection in turbine engine fuel systems, set forth in \u00a7 23.951, applies to the entire fuel system. As proposed, \u00a7 23.997(b) would require a drain. Upon further consideration it has been determined that an equivalent of the drain could be provided by having the strainer or filter easily removable for drain purposes and this alternative has been incorporated into the regulation. Proposal 3 \u2014One commentator ques\u00ad tioned whether the oil sump of a dry sump engine would be considered as ex\u00ad pansion space under the proposal. If the sump is in fact part of the oil tank, then the sump provides the expansion space specified in \u00a7 23.1013(b) (1). Fur\u00ad ther amendment of the requirement is not considered necessary and \u00a7 23.1013 (b)(1) is adopted as proposed. One commentator requested clarifica\u00ad tion of the phrase \"that might reduce the flow of oil,\" used in proposed \u00a723.1013 Ce). Several other commentators sug\u00ad gested that the phrase was inconsistent with, but should be identical to, proposed \u00a7 25.1013. The FAA agrees with these comments and has revised the section to make it consistent with \u00a7 25.1013 in this respect, by specifying that any oil tank outlet screen or guard may not reduce the flow of oil below a safe value at any operating temperature. Proposal 4 \u2014One commentator sug\u00ad gested that the more technically correct term \"differential pressure\" be used in place of \"pressure,\" in paragraph (c) of \u00a7 23.1015. The FAA believes, however, that the present term is adequately un\u00ad derstood in th\u00e9 industry, and has not caused any misunderstanding in the past. The paragraph is therefore adopted as proposed. Proposal 5 \u2014Several commentators ex\u00ad pressed the belief that the proposed \u00a7 23.1019 might be interpreted to require each and every oil strainer or filter in the system including small so-called \"last chance\" filters to conform to all the re\u00ad quirements of paragraph (a). The in\u00ad tent of the FAA is to require at least one oil strainer or filter that will filter all the oil that passes through the lubri\u00ad cating system while conforming to the requirements of the section. The rule as adopted has been reworded to make this clear. Another commentators objected to the word \"conveys\" as inappropriate in the lead-in sentence of paragraph (a). The FAA agrees and has changed the wording to refer to a strainer or filter through which all of the engine oil flows. Several commentators interpreted the requirement of subparagraph (a) (1) for normal oil flow through the bypass as possibly requiring identical flow and pro\u00ad posed the word \"adequate\" in place of normaL\" The FAA does not agree that the word \"normal\" means identical and used the word normal to mean normal forthe system within its operating range. Therefore, the wording as proposed has been retained. One commentator stated that filters should be serviced on a routine and nor\u00ad mal maintenance basis rather than re\u00ad lying upon an indicator as proposed in subparagraph (a) (3). In this connection it should be noted, however, that the rule does not call for relaxing of any main\u00ad tenance procedures but adds an addi\u00ad tional item which will contribute to safety by providing a quick means of in\u00ad specting for possible filter contamination. It was assumed in one comment that the standard engine oil pressure gauge would qualify as an \"indicator\" as re\u00ad quired in proposed subparagraph (a) (3). While it was considered that a separate indicator would be provided, neverthe\u00ad less, if the applicant can demonstrate that the oil pressure gauge would ade\u00ad quately perform the function of the indi\u00ad cator, a separate indicator would not be required. Upon further consideration, the function of the indicator in terms of con\u00ad tamination of the screen has been re\u00ad worded for clarity. Several commentators questioned whether the wording of subparagraph (a) (4) was realistic in requiring that no contaminants be released through the filter bypass. As proposed, the require\u00ad ment stated an absolute prohibition against release of contaminants. The FAA agrees that the intended purpose may be met by requiring the bypass to be designed to minimize release of contaminants, and the requirement is reworded accordingly. Proposal 6 \u2014Several commentators objected to the requirement in proposed \u00a7 23.1093 for operation in falling and blowing snow on the basis that no stand\u00ad ard is specified as to the intensity or the amount of falling snow or the degree of blowing involved. They further point out that no uniform means are provided for demonstrating compliance with the sec\u00ad tion and that a small or even minute amount of snow might satisfy the letter of the law of this section. One com\u00ad mentator offered detailed standards that could be adopted. However, it was not the intent that specifications for all pos\u00ad sible conditions be included in the reg\u00ad ulation but, rather, that an applicant select the limitations desired for his air\u00ad plane and then demonstrate the ability to operate within those limitations. Several commentators asserted that the specified liquid water content of 2 grams per cubic meter was not repre\u00ad sentative of actual conditions and would result in more stringent requirements for ground operation than for flight, while another suggested that the re\u00ad quirement for. icing protection at idle should be applicable \"on the ground\" rather than at sea level. Upon further consideration, the FAA agrees that a reduction to 0.6 grams would provide an adequate and safe standard for icing protection at idle conditions on the ground and the requirement has been changed accordingly.One commentator objected to the re\u00ad quirement for icing protection for 30 minutes at idle, stating that there was insufficient bleed air to adequately meet the requirement for this period of time. However, experience has demonstrated that it is practical and necessary for safety of flight, and that protection for the engine during prolonged idle prior to takeoff is essential to safety of opera\u00ad tion. The proposal does not restrict the means for icing protection to engine bleed air, as suggested by the commenta\u00ad tor, but allows any means or combina\u00ad tion of means which the applicant chooses. With respect to bleed air, the intent of the requirement is that icing protection at idle be provided when the bleed air available for icing protection is at its critical condition. The section has been reworded to make this clear. Proposal 7\u2014Amendment 23-14, effec\u00ad tive December 20, 1973, published in the Federal Register on November 19, 1973 (38 FR 31816), amended \u00a7 23.1183(a) to require that lines and fittings and com\u00ad ponents carrying gas, air, or flammable fluids in any area subject to engine fire conditions must be at least fire resistant. That amendment also amended the heading of the section, while retaining the requirement that flexible hose as\u00ad semblies must be approved. Therefore, the section as amended by this Amend\u00ad ment, contains the provisions made ef\u00ad fective by amendment 23-14 in addition to those proposed in Notice 71-12, in\u00ad cluding the revision of the latter dis\u00ad cussed below. Inasmuch as the heading proposed in Notice 71-12 is inappropri\u00ad ate to the section as amended by Amendment 23-14, the heading adopted by the amendment is retained. Stating that proposed \u00a7 23.1183, which concerns engine fire protection, is in\u00ad appropriately included with aircraft air\u00ad worthiness standards, one commentator suggested that it more correctly belongs in Part 33 relating to engine airworthi\u00ad ness requirements. However, while this and other sections do relate to engine airworthiness, they are included also in Part 23 and the other aircraft certifica\u00ad tion parts since it is the intent that air\u00ad craft certificated under applications made after the adoption of these amend\u00ad ments conform to the new updated sec\u00ad tions of Part 33, whether or not they incorporate engines type certificated under the updated Part 33. Thus, to cover cases where such aircraft incorpo\u00ad rate engines certificated under applica\u00ad tions made before adoption of these amendments, the new engine standards that are appropriate are made effective as to the aircraft by being incorporated in the aircraft airworthiness sections. One commentator questioned whether integral oil sumps on smaller reciprocat\u00ad ing engines were considered to come within the meaning of flammable fluid tanks as that term was used in proposed \u00a3 23.1183. The FAA did not intend that they be included, and the rule as adopted specifically provides that integral oil sumps of less than 20 quart capacity need not be fireproof nor be enclosed by a fire\u00ad proof shield. FEDERAL REGISTER, V O L 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 35454 RULE5 AND REGULATIONS Proposal 8 \u2014As a result of the issuance of Amendment 23-14 (38 FR 31816), which contains new paragraphs, \u00a7 23.- 1305 (q) and (r), the proposed para\u00ad graphs (q), (r), (s), and (t) are re\u00ad designated (s ), (t ), (u ), and (v ), respec\u00ad tively. The following discussion is keyed to the new designations. One commentator questioned whether the fuel strainer or filter indicator re\u00ad ferred to in \u00a7 23.1305(t) were required on all filters, even \"last chance\" filters. Consistent with the requirements appli\u00ad cable to the strainers or filters them-, selves, \u00a7 23.1305 (t) has been revised to make clear that the indicator required is for a fuel strainer or filter required und\u00e8r \u00a7 23.997. Similarly, \u00a7 23.1305(t) and (u) have sistent with \u00a7\u00a7 23.997 and 23.1019, to the degree of con\u00ad tamination that must be indicated. In response to a further comment, \u00a7 23.1305 (t) has been reworded to clarify that the desired indication is of the occurrence of contamination rather than the more stringent requirements of the degree of contamination as suggested in the Notice. This change achieves consistency between paragraphs (t) and (u). One commentator questioned whether other presently installed gauges for other functions could be used as \"indicators\" to indicate the functioning of a heater as required in paragraph (v ). As discussed above, in connection with the indicators required for oil strainers or filters, the FAA anticipates that the requirement will .be met by installation of gauges to indicate the functioning of heaters. However, if a clear and positive indica\u00ad tion can be obtained from other gauges used to portray functions different than direct heater functioning, the require\u00ad ments of the section are met. Part 25\u2014 Air w o r t h in e s s Standards : Transport Category Air planes Proposed changes to \u00a7\u00a7 25.951 (Pro\u00ad posal 1), 25.997 (Proposal 3), 25.1015 (Proposal 5), 25.1019 (Proposal 6), and 25.1093 (Proposal 7) were the subject of comments substantially the same as sub\u00ad mitted for the proposed like-numbered sections of Part 23. As adopted, these Part 25 sections set forth the same re\u00ad quirements as proposed in Notice 71-12 except as they have been modified for the reasons given in the preamble discus\u00ad sion of the like-numbered Part 23 sections. Proposal 2 \u2014No comments were received in response to the proposed deletion of \u00a7 25.977(b). That paragraph is accord\u00ad ingly revoked and marked reserved. Proposal 4 \u2014The exemption contained in the last sentence of \u00a7 25.1013(a), con\u00ad cerning fireproofing of an integral oil sump of less than 20-quart capacity on a reciprocating engine, has been removed from this section and placed in \u00a7 25.1183 (a ). This action involves no substantive change and achieves consistency with the parallel Part 23 section. Proposal 8 \u2014Section 25.1183(a) has been further amended in connection with changes to \u00a7 25.1013(a) as noted under Proposal 4.Proposal 9 \u2014Section 25.1305(c) has been amended so that it is substantively the same as the parallel provision of \u00a7 23.1305. The related Part 23 preamble discussion is applicable. The proposed new subparagraph 25.1305(d)(3), con\u00ad cerning an indicator to indicate rotor system imbalance, has already been adopted by a separate rulemaking action (Arndt. 25-35, 39 FR 1831). One commentator stated that aircraft fuel systems have been designed without cockpit controlled fuel heat; therefore there is no need in proposed subpara\u00ad graph (c) (8) for an indicator to indicate the proper functioning of any fuel heater. The section, however, only requires an indicator if a heater is used and the FAA believes it would supply necessary infor\u00ad mation to indicate heater functioning. Part 27\u2014 Air w o r t h in e s s Standards : Norm al Category Rotorcraft Proposed changes affecting \u00a7\u00a7 27.951 (Proposal 1), 27.997 (Proposal 2), 27.1013 (Proposal 3), 27.1015 (Proposal 4), 27.1019 (Proposal 5), 27.1093 (Proposal 6), 27.1183 (Proposal 7), and 27.1305 (Proposal 8) were the subject of com\u00ad ments substantially the same as sub\u00ad mitted for the proposed like-numbered sections of Part 23. The proposed amend\u00ad ments set forth in Notice 71\u2014 12 have been adopted except as explained in the preamble discussion of the like-num\u00ad bered Part 23 sections. Part 29\u2014 Air w o r t h in e s s Standards : Transport Category Rotorcraft Proposed changes affected \u00a7\u00a7 29.951 (Proposal 1), 29.997 (Proposal 2), 29.1013 (Proposal 3), 29.1015 (Proposal 4), 29.1019 (Proposal 5), 29.1093 (Proposal 6), 29.1183 (Proposal 7), and 29.1305 (Proposal 8) were the subject of com\u00ad ments substantially the same as sub\u00ad mitted for the proposed like-numbered sections of Part 23. The proposed amendments set forth in Notice 71-12 have been adopted except as explained in the preamble discussion of the like- numbered Part 23 sections. Part 33\u2014 Air w o r t h in e s s Standards : Aircraft En g in e s Proposal 1 \u2014The comments received in response to proposed \u00a7 33.5 focused prin\u00ad cipally on the overhaul instructions that would be required by paragraph (e ). The comments revealed widespread misun\u00ad derstanding of the effect of requiring the engine manufacturer to set out the fre\u00ad quency of overhauls. In this connection, the FAA wishes to point out that over\u00ad haul instructions are necessary upon type certification because an engine might require overhaul at any time thereafter, and the ability to perform an overhaul should not be limited by lack of instructions. Furthermore, the manu\u00ad facturer's statement of overhaul fre\u00ad quency is not established as an operating limitation but operates merely as a recommendation; it does not preclude the establishment of different., overhaul intervals, nor does it preclude the \"piece\u00ad meal\" overhaul practice followed by op\u00ad erators using continuous airworthinessmaintenance programs. It should be noted, however, that the initial overhaul time established under \u00a7 33.90 and re\u00ad ferred to in \u00a7 33.7(c) (17) Is an operating limitation that must be complied with regardless of the adoption of any other practice; the initial overhaul, whether accomplished \"piecemeal\" or otherwise, must be completed within the time established. With regard to a question raised by one commentator concerning the re\u00ad quirements in \u00a7 33.5(e) (2) that certain component life limits be specified in the required instructions, the FAA wishes to call attention to the fact that no sep\u00ad arate requirement is thus established that would have any effect on operators of the engines. The life limits of all com\u00ad ponents requiring replacement are es\u00ad tablished under other sections of Part 33 as operating limitations that must be complied with, and their publication in the required instructions is a conven\u00ad ience to operators. Upon further review, \u00a7 33.5(a)(1) is revised to include a requirement that the installation instructions contain the maximum allowable loads for engine mounting attachments and related structure, which are required to be de\u00ad termined in complying with \u00a7 33.23. Similarly, \u00a7 33.5(a) (2) is revised to in\u00ad clude a requirement for description of the pipes, wires, cables, ducts, and cowl\u00ad ing covered by that section. That infor\u00ad mation is considered essential for in\u00ad stallation, and FAA practice has been to require it for compliance with prior \u00a7 33.5. Proposal 2 \u2014The effect of proposed \u00a7 33.7 was misunderstood by a number of commentators who objected to various ratings and limitations listed therein. Contrary to the apparent belief of those commentators, no ratings or limitations would be established independently un\u00ad der \u00a7 33.7; the section merely contains a list of ratings and limitations established either under applicable requirements of Part 33 that predate the Notice, or under proposed new requirements contained in the Notice. Consideration was thus given to the substance of the comments as they related to substantive requirements pro\u00ad posed in the Notice. Discussion of com\u00ad ments directed to \u00a7 33.7 but relating to proposed new requirements is found with other comments under the appropriate section. However, as a result of such comments, one substantive change has been made that affects \u00a7 33.7; no rating or limitation need be established for tur\u00ad bine engine internal cooling air flow, and proposed \u00a7 33.7(c) (12) has therefore been deleted, with attendant necessary renumbering of the succeeding subpara\u00ad graphs. Other changes of an editorial nature have been made for internal con\u00ad sistency between \u00a7 33.7 and other Fed\u00ad eral Aviation regulations. Proposal 3 \u2014No public comment was received on the proposed deletion of \u00a7 33.13, and the section has been revoked and marked \"reserved.\" Proposal 4 \u2014Several comments were received that contained objections to the FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 RULES AND REGULATIONS 35455 start-stop stress cycle described in pro\u00ad posed \u00a7 33.14 as not being representative of a typical operating cycle that would produce the stresses to be accounted for by the requirement. In particular, there was objection to the requirement that disc and spacer temperatures be stabi\u00ad lized after stopping the engine in order to complete a cycle. The PAA agrees that final temperature stabilization should not be necessary where an applicant can show that the components experience the complete stress range without such stabilization, and the definition of a start-stop stress cycle as adopted in\u00ad cludes a provision to allow for such a showing. Another commentator suggested that the operating limitation be defined as the number of cycles to a detectable crack rather than to failure. The PAA regards a crack as a failure and the rule as adopted applies not only to cracks but to other types of failures which may occur prior to the occurrence of a de\u00ad tectable crack. A commentator recommended that spacers be deleted from the section be\u00ad cause they would not normally be critical. The PAA disagrees; spacers are a critical item in low cycle fatigue, and the re\u00ad quirement, in this regard, is adopted as proposed. One commentator stated the belief that the establishment of component life limits would result in a complicated and time-consuming process for extending component life. The FAA points out that the listing of this limit on the type cer\u00ad tificate as required by this section pro\u00ad vides only an initial limit and will not in any way complicate the procedure for extending the limit. In this connection, the section as adopted is revised to clarify that the required operating limitations and the provision for increasing them apply individually to each rotor disc and spacer. Proposal 5 \u2014Several commentators objected to the new standard of protec\u00ad tion proposed in \u00a7 33.17(b) for external lines, fittings, and components as un\u00ad necessary because the matter is ade\u00ad quately covered in paragraphs (a) and (c) of that section, while another com\u00ad mentator asserted that, due to consider\u00ad ations of airflow and venting, the re\u00ad quirement should be imposed only on the airframe. The FAA does not agree with these positions. The new requirement in (b) for protection against ignition of leaking flammable fluids is necessary to deal with possible impingement of such fluids on hot surfaces. Furthermore, since engine design necessarily includes considerations of airflow and venting, this requirement in Part 33 will assure that those considerations take account of possible ignition of leaking flammable fluid that could result from its impinge\u00ad ment on engine components. In response to comments questioning the applicability of proposed \u00a7 33.17(c) to integral oil sumps on the smaller recip\u00ad rocating engines, the requirement as adopted is revised to exclude such sumps having less than a 20-quart capacity. The requirement is thus made consistentwith the parallel requirements in the aircraft airworthiness parts. One commentator- believed that a clear definition of \"fireproof\" and \"fire re\u00ad sistant\" was lacking in the regulations and suggested that temperature, dura\u00ad tion and flame intensity should be speci\u00ad fied as part of any definition. The defini\u00ad tions in \u00a7 1.1 of the regulations include both \"fireproof\" and \"fire resistant\" and any further changes to these definitions would be outside the scope of the Notice. One commentator questioned whether under paragraph (e) , the accumulation of fluid is interpreted as occurring inside of the engine and suggested that the sec\u00ad tion should specify unwanted flammable fluid. The FAA agrees that the section is intended to refer to unwanted flam\u00ad mable fluid and is directed to areas in\u00ad ternal to the engine. The requirement as adopted is reworded accordingly. Proposal 6 \u2014The comments received in response to proposed \u00a7 33.25 expressed general agreement with the intent of the requirement as understood by the com\u00ad mentators. However, several of the com\u00ad ments indicated a need for clarification regarding the applicability of limit loads to accessory drives and mounting attach\u00ad ments. The FAA agrees that the intent of the proposal was that the limit load requirement apply to accessory drives and mounting attachments and the sec\u00ad tion as adopted is reworded to make this clear. In addition, as suggested by one com\u00ad mentator, a provision has been added to make clear that the use of engine oil for lubrication of accessory drives and mounting attachments is permitted, with appropriate sealing provisions. Proposal 7 \u2014I t . was pointed out that reference to \"excessive speed, tempera\u00ad ture, and vibration\" in proposed \u00a7 33.27 (a) was vague in view of the very specific requirements in proposed paragraph (d ). Since it was the intent of the proposal to relate the two requirements, \u00a7 33.27(a) as adopted is revised to clearly refer to the specific tests included in the section. Several commentators objected to the speeds proposed in the overspeed tests required in \u00a7 33.27. They expressed the opinion that the rotor speed strength demonstrations which are currently ac\u00ad cepted by the FAA and which are 5 per\u00ad cent lower in all cases than the proposed requirements demonstrate an adequate margin of strength. In this connection, one commentator pointed to 6 million hours of service experience with no disc bursts. The FAA finds compelling merit in these comments and upon further con\u00ad sideration the overspeed requirements as adopted are 5 percent less than those proposed. Several commentators- believed that the proposal to use a test article fabri\u00ad cated with minimum qualities allowed by the specification was an impractical re\u00ad quirement. They expressed the opinion that to conform to the proposal as writ\u00ad ten would require a component made with all the minimum properties of the specifications, a condition which could not be met. The FAA agrees with thesecomments and upon further considera\u00ad tion has deleted the proposal. Several commentators objected to the proposed paragraph (c) of \u00a7 33.27 re\u00ad garding cooling airflow as being too re\u00ad strictive. They pointed out that in designs where there is more than one cooling passage, one passage could be blocked and still allow passage of an adequate flow of cooling air. While this might be less than normal cooling air\u00ad flow it might still ensure adequate cool\u00ad ing. The FAA agrees that the proposed requirement would not accomplish the intended purpose and, in connection with the deletion of other proposed require\u00ad ments relating to cooling* airflow that were determined to be impracticable (see discussion relating to \u00a7\u00a733.7 and 33.87), the section is adopted without the pro\u00ad posed paragraph (c ). Proposal 8 \u2014One commentator ex\u00ad pressed the opinion that the instrument connection markings required in pro\u00ad posed \u00a7 33.29 would be unnecessary if it could be shown that there was no possi\u00ad bility of an instrument being connected to the wrong connection. The FAA agrees that this would satisfy the requirements of the rule and, accordingly, the section as adopted is revised to specifically allow this. In addition, the section has been revised by deletion of the word \" new\" which was inadvertently included in the proposal, to clarify that it applies to all engine limitations. The proposed requirement relating to rotor system imbalance contained in proposed \u00a7 33.29(b), as noted previously in this preamble, has been adopted in a separate rulemaking action (Arndt. 33- 5; 39 FR 1831). Proposal 9 \u2014The only public comment received in response to the proposed new \u00a7 33.42 recommended deletion of the re\u00ad quirement but gave no reason for the rec\u00ad ommendation. The section is adopted as proposed. Proposal 10\u2014A comment was received that questioned the speed range that would be applicable to the proposed re\u00ad quirement in \u00a7 33.43(a) for a vibration survey with a cylinder not firing. As pro\u00ad posed, the requirement implies the same speed range that is applicable to the en\u00ad gine with all cylinders firing. The FAA agrees that this would be impractical and the requirement is revised to specify that the applicable speed range is from idle to maximum desired takeoff speed rating. Several commentators questioned whether the vibration test survey speci\u00ad fied in paragraph (a) required the same propeller used for the endurance test or a propeller of the same configuration. The FAA intended that the same configura\u00ad tion of propeller could be used for the tests and the rule as adopted is revised to clarify the intent for both propellers and loading devices. One commentator recommended that \u00a7 33.43(a) be revised to exclude the pro\u00ad peller shaft or other output shafts from the vibration survey. The FAA does not agree that they should be excluded since they are the most vital components re\u00ad quiring vibration measurements and FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 35456 RULES AND REGULATIONS tests. However, this does not include any accessory drive shafts, which are re\u00ad quired to be loaded under \u00a7 53.43(c) in order to assess the effects of such loads on the propeller or other output shaft. One commentator regarded that the number of cycles to demonstrate com\u00ad pliance for fatigue testing of steel shafts specified in \u00a7 33.43(b) should be 10 mil\u00ad lion rather than 10 ^ million cycles: The FAA agrees that 10 million cycles repre\u00ad sents an accepted standard and the re\u00ad quirement is revised accordingly. A commentator recommended that \u00a7 33.43(c) which requires accessories to be loaded during the vibration tests be deleted as being unnecessary for tor\u00ad sional surveys. The FAA does not agree; the purpose of the test is to disclose pos\u00ad sible adverse vibration effects, including any that might be contributed by acces\u00ad sories. Proposal 11 \u2014Several commentators objected to the proposed \u00a7 33.45(b) re\u00ad quirement for a recalibration after the endurance test as being impracticable and unnecessarily adding to the endur\u00ad ance test. They suggested that the intent of the section, to ensure that any power loss during the endurance test be deter\u00ad mined, could be met by modifying the rule to require a \" power check\" in place of a recalibration. The FAA agrees that a full recalibration is not required to determine power loss and the section is revised to require a power check in place of a recalibration. In addition, since the section permits use of measurements taken during the final portion of the endurance test, reference to the finish of that test has been deleted. Proposal 12 \u2014Upon further considera\u00ad tion, the parenthetical statement in the first sentence of paragraph (a) of pro\u00ad posed \u00a7 33.49 is revised to clarify that the additional testing requirements that ap\u00ad ply to a turbosupercharger are com\u00ad applicant may elect to run the engine-turbosuper\u00ad charger combination an additional 50 hours in complying with that require\u00ad ment, but it is not necessary to do so. One commentator felt that in \u00a7 33.49, the accessory loading provision referred to in paragraph (a) could be interpreted to require the limit load to be applied during all operations. The intent of this rule is to require limit loads only during operation at rated maximum continuous power and rated takeoff power, and the section is revised accordingly. One commentator recommended that instead of requiring maximum cylinder temperatures during all of the endurance running at maximum and takeoff powers that a shorter time period would ade\u00ad quately demonstrate cylinder assembly integrity. The FAA agrees with the rec\u00ad ommendation and the rule as adopted requires testing with cylinder and oil inlet temperatures specified, for 35 hours, the time currently used in certification practice. Furthermore, the FAA agrees with another commentator that as long as the cylinder temperatures are moni\u00adtored the intent of the section will be met, and the requirement is revised to refer to cylinder temperature, deleting reference to the cylinder barrel and head. A commentator recommended that the altitude testing requirements for turbo- supercharged engines be deleted and the tests be run at sea level condition. The FAA does not agree. The altitude test\u00ad ing requirements are necessary. How\u00ad ever, the section as adopted is revised by rewording the lead-in sentence of \u00a7 33.49(e) to allow as an alternative that altitude tests may be simulated, and by deleting proposed \u00a7 33.49(e) (1) (iii) . Proposal 13 \u2014Several commentators objected that the proposed requirement in \u00a7 33.55(b) that all adjustment settings and functioning characteristics that can be established independent of installa\u00ad tion on the engine be unchanged at tear- down is unnecessarily restrictive. The FAA agrees that the intent of the pro\u00ad posal would be satisfied if those func\u00ad tioning characteristics remain within limits established at the beginning of the endurance test, and the requirement is revised accordingly. Several commentators believed that the requirement proposed in \u00a7 33.55(c) that components conform to the type de\u00ad sign after the endurance test was too severe, especially since this would require parts to remain within drawing toler\u00ad ances. The FAA does not agree. The type design includes dimensions within which a component may change in serv\u00ad ice. A component that sustains wear be\u00ad yond those limits during a 150-hour en\u00ad durance test has not met minimum air\u00ad worthiness standards. Proposal 14 \u2014The last sentence of \u00a7 33.57(b) as proposed is amended to require the engine \"or\" its parts to be subjected to additional tests if required instead of the engine \"and\" its parts. As discussed in connection with Pro\u00ad posal 1 of Part 21, new \u00a7 33.62 is added to require stress analysis of certain en\u00ad gine parts. Proposal 15 \u2014A commentator recom\u00ad mended revision of proposed \u00a7 33.65 to include reference to the allowable engine operating limitations in order to clarify that there could not be a finding of non- compliance if any of the undesired effects resulted from operations beyond those limitations. The section is intended to apply only to operations that are within allowable operating limitations as set forth in the manufacturer's operating instructions and the requirement is re\u00ad vised to make this clear. hi addition, the section is revised to delete the reference to inlet air distor\u00ad tion caused by cross-wind, which is ade\u00ad quately covered by the manufacturer's specification of limiting inlet air distor\u00ad tion, and to ice ingestion, which is ade\u00ad quately covered by other requirements. Proposal 16 \u2014Several commentators recommended that \u00a7 33.66 be clarified to avoid the interpretation that a reduction in engine performance due to bleed air would be an \"adverse effect on the en\u00ad gine.\" To preclude this possible misin\u00adterpretation, the section is revised ac\u00ad cordingly. Proposal 17 \u2014Several commentators suggested that paragraph (a) of \u00a7 3 3 .6 7 be revised to allow for the use of seals and locking devices as alternatives to making the fuel control adjusting m eans inaccessible. The FAA agrees that these alternative means may be used to achieve the desired intent and the section is re\u00ad vised accordingly. Several commentators expressed doubt that it should be necessary to add any water to saturated fuel since upon cool\u00ad ing the saturated water would precipitate out, thus representing the most critical condition. The FAA does not agree that the amount of water which may precipi\u00ad tate out properly represents the m ost critical amount of free water possible in the system. The added water is necessary to simulate critical conditions. Several commentators expressed doubt that \u00a7 33.67(b) (6) could be literally complied with and suggested that the aim of the rule was that all means b e taken to prevent the release of contami\u00ad nants, and that an insignificant amount of contaminant release should not violate the rule. The FAA agrees with th is comment and the rule as adopted re\u00ad quires design of the bypass to minimize release of contaminants. Other revisions to the section have been made for the reasons set forth in the discussion relating to \u00a7 23.997, which contains like requirements. Proposal 18 \u2014The comments received in response to proposed \u00a7 33.68 were sim \u00ad ilar to those received in connection with the substantively similar provisions con\u00ad tained in proposal 6 of Part 23, \u00a7 23.1093. The section is revised in accordance with the discussion pertaining to revisions of that section. Proposal 19 \u2014Several commentators objected to the requirement in \u00a7 33.69 for two igniters; however, this is the re\u00ad quirement of the present rule and the only proposed- change to the rule is the requirement for a single igniter for fuel augmentation systems. No objections were received to this provision. Proposal 20 \u2014Several commentators objected to the requirement in \u00a7 33.71(b) (6) for cockpit indication of oil filter contamination, where no bypass is in\u00ad corporated. However, the FAA considers the addition of a cockpit indicator to b e necessary in the interest of safety in order to enable the flight crew to pre\u00ad vent engine failure due to oil starvation, that might occur if all required filters in the lubrication system do not incorporate the protection of a filter bypass. As indicated by other commentators, the words \"extreme temperature\" as used in proposed \u00a7 33.71(c) (9) could be taken to require compliance at temperatures beyond the intended operating range. Such a result would be contrary to the intent of the requirement and the sec\u00ad tion as adopted is revised to refer to maximum operating temperature. In re\u00ad sponse to other comments the differen\u00ad tial pressure requirement in subpara\u00ad graph (e) (9) is reworded to clarify that FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 RULES AND REGULATIONS 35457 it may not be less than 5 p.s.i. above the maximum operating pressure of the tank. One commentator considered that the lack of a requirement for a bypass was a serious deficiency in the proposal. The PAA has considered this question many times including extensive discussion at government-industry airworthiness meetings and has determined that due to the serious divergence of opinion the use of a bypass should at present be op\u00ad tional. If no bypass is used, however, the applicant must comply with other safe\u00ad guards contained in the section to en\u00ad sure safe operation of the lubrication system. The remainder of the comments were similar to those made in response to pro\u00ad posals 3, 4, and 5 of Part 23 and have been responded to in discussion of those proposals. The section has been reworded in part to conform with the changes made to the sections involved in those proposals. Proposal 21 \u2014One commentator rec\u00ad ommended that \u00a7 33.72 should refer to a \"main\" filter only. The FAA does not agree; the requirements are meant to apply to each filter or screen incorpo\u00ad rated in the system. Proposal 22 \u2014Several commentators believed that \u00a7 33.75 as written was con\u00ad fusing and ambiguous. The printed no\u00ad tice was incorrectly worded and the section is rewritten to read correctly. Several commentators suggested that the word \"burst\" in subparagraph (b) was ambiguous and needed further defi\u00ad nition. The FAA agrees and, accord\u00ad ingly, a further descriptive phrase, \"penetrate its case,\" is added. One commentator suggested that the phrase \"improper operations\" be sub\u00ad stituted for \"bad operation\". The FAA agrees with the suggestion and the sec\u00ad tion incorporates this change. One commentator objected to con\u00ad sideration of multiple failures, to avoid consideration of an infinite number of possible failures. The analysis however does not require that all possible multiple failures be considered, but uses the ac\u00ad cepted standard of consideration of only the probable single or multiple failures. Proposal 23 \u2014One commentator sug\u00ad gested that \u00a7 33.77(a) (2) be clarified to ensure that a burst meant uncontained burst that penetrates the case. The FAA agrees that this is the intent of the sec\u00ad tion and it is revised accordingly. Several commentators suggested that the footnote to the table be modified to permit the option of demonstrating con\u00ad tainment on a component basis for all the test items. The FAA does not agree that this would adequately account for secondary effects except in the case of blade containment in fan engines as noted. Several commentators expressed doubt that the proposed rate of ingestion of 1% pound birds was supported by ornithological data or actual flight ex\u00ad perience. They suggested that a lesser rate be used. The FAA, after further study and consideration, agrees. Accord- mgly, the ingestion rate for 1 y2 poundbirds is established at one for the first 300 square inches of inlet area and at one for each 600 additional square inches or fraction thereof, of up to a maximum of 8 birds. The practical reality of a 4-inch hail\u00ad stone was questioned in some of the comments. The FAA, after further study, has determined that this size will probably not be encountered in actual flight conditions and the section is amended to delete the requirement. Several commentators believed that the amount of sand and gravel specified was excessive and not representative of actual conditions. After further consid\u00ad eration, the FAA agrees that the amount proposed should be reduced and the section is revised accordingly. The FAA agrees with the point raised by several commentators that, in \u00a7 33.77 (c ), some power or thrust loss should be permitted since the ingestion of these objects will certainly cause a temporary power loss. Accordingly, the requirement is revised to permit power or thrust loss that is not \"sustained.\" In addition, \u00a7 33.77(f) is revised, upon further con\u00ad sideration, to require testing for water ingestion to take place under takeoff operating conditions rather than the proposed \"maximum cruise.\" This re\u00ad flects current practice in engine certifi\u00ad cation. The 34 by 1 inch bolt test is deleted since the test for the broken rotor blade is a more stringent test and will ade\u00ad quately account for the effects of the bolt. A comment was received that objected to the provision in proposed \u00a7 33.77(d) (3) relating to obstruction of induction airflow by foreign objects that are stopped by a protective device. The FAA wishes to point out that the subject provision does not state a requirement that must be met by all applicants. Rather, it provides an alternative to test\u00ad ing for the effects of objects that can be stopped by a protective device and prevented, by deflection out of the air\u00ad flow path or by some other means, from Obstructing the induction airflow in any way. In addition, a new paragraph (e) is included in \u00a7 33.77 to incorporate the suggestion offered by some commenta\u00ad tors that the effects of ingestion of some foreign objects can be accounted for by the effects of others. Thus, in showing compliance with \u00a7 33.77(a) the appli\u00ad cant is required to test only for that ob\u00ad ject that is shown to have the most severe effect. Similarly, for compliance with (b), testing is required for sand and gravel and either the 3 ounce or 1 y2 pound birds, depending on the size of the engine inlet, as designated in \u00a7 33.77(f). Proposed paragraph (e) is redesig\u00ad nated as paragraph (f). Proposal 24 \u2014One commentator rec\u00ad ommended that in \u00a7 33.79(a) an accept\u00ad able means of compliance to demonstrate cooling be provided for the guidance of the applicant. The FAA, upon further consideration agrees that the section does not adequately establish a definableobjective and the proposal is withdrawn for further study. Proposed paragraphs (b) through (f) are redesignated (a) through (e), respectively. One commentator believed that para\u00ad graph (e) of the proposed rule could be misinterpreted as allowing a loss of thrust to the unaugmented engine in an amount equal to that added by the aug\u00ad menter. To avoid possible misinterpreta\u00ad tion, the requirement, adopted in \u00a7 33.79 (d ), is reworded to clarify that the loss of thrust mentioned means only the thrust that is provided by augmenta\u00ad tion. Furthermore, upon further consid\u00ad eration, the FAA has revised the re\u00ad quirement to refer only to failure or mal\u00ad function of augmenter combustion, since the effects of other possible aug\u00ad menter failures on engine thrust can\u00ad not be reliably predicted. One commentator recommended clari\u00ad fication of proposed paragraph (f) to ensure that the rotational speed men\u00ad tioned be the minimum rotational speed at which the thrust augmentation func\u00ad tions. This is the original intent of the paragraph and it is modified accordingly. Proposal 25 \u2014 One commentator pointed out an error in the explanation of proposed changes to \u00a7 33.81. Instead of referring to \u00a7 33.43, it should have referred to \u00a7 33.87. No change to the adopted rule itself is necessary, however.. Proposal 26 \u2014No comments were re\u00ad ceived on the proposed new \u00a7 33.82, and th\u00e9 section is adopted as proposed. Proposal 27 \u2014Several commentators recommended that the requirement in \u00a7 33.83 for testing to 110 percent of the desired maximum continuous speed rating be deleted because certain high performance turbine engines may not be capable of achieving this overspeed con\u00ad dition. Upon further consideration, the FAA agrees with the commentators' po\u00ad sition and the requirement is deleted. Other revisions to the section have been made for the reasons set forth in the discussion relating to \u00a7 33.43, which contains like requirements. Proposal 28 \u2014Revisions have been made to \u00a7 33.85 for the reasons set forth in the discussion relating to \u00a7 33.45, which contains like requirements. Proposal 29 \u2014Several commentators requested that the surface temperature requirement be deleted from proposed \u00a7 33.87(a) (3) as being difficult to simu\u00ad late on a test stand. The section is in\u00ad tended by the FAA to require that if an engine external temperature limit be specified by the applicant as being criti\u00ad cal, then the applicant must demonstrate satisfactory operation at that tempera\u00ad ture. It is pointed out that only those temperatures specified by the applicant need be held at their specified values and the requirement is reworded to clarify this. In addition, the section is revised to provide allowance for more than one test run if all parameters cannot be held at the required values simultaneously. Several commentators objected to sub- paragraph (a) (4) of \u00a7 33.87 which had called for fuels, lubricants, and hydraulic fluids with the lowest thermal breakdown FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 35458 temperatures allowed by their specifica\u00ad tions to be used during the tests. They felt that this was practically an impos\u00ad sible requirement because of the unavail\u00ad ability of fluids and lubricants with all the m inim um properties called for. The FAA agrees, and the requirement is revised to call for specified fluids and lubricants used during the endurance tests to conform to their respective specifications. One commentator suggested that \u00a7 33.87(a) (6) be amended to require that only shear and overload loads be tested and that the requirement for other loading during the endurance tests be deleted. The FAA does not agree, but intended that the endurance test simu\u00ad late actual operation and include testing of the accessories drives themselves as well as other portions of the engine. This requires loading of those drives, and the rule is adopted as proposed. Several commentators questioned Whether the limit load for accessories specified in subparagraph (a) (6) should apply only during maximum power op\u00ad eration. This is the intended construc\u00ad tion of the section, and it is amended to reflect this intent. One commentator expressed concern that compliance' with \u00a7 33.87(a) (8) which calls for cooling air simulation could not be demonstrated since in a particular engine there may be many divisions of cooling air-flow which might make it virtually impossible to individ\u00ad ually regulate each separate cooling air\u00ad flow path. The FAA agrees with the com\u00ad mentator's position and the proposal is withdrawn for further study. Several commentators suggested that the references to supersonic engines be deleted because of the lack of foreseeable need for such engines. The FAA does not agree. One of the purposes in formulating these new amendments is to establish standards for that new generation of engines, especially since the FAA is in the process of presently certificating such engines. One commentator pointed out that the proposal did not include the false start tests of the present rule. This was an inadvertent omission and those false start tests are included in the adopted rule. Proposal 30 \u2014The phrase \"for installa\u00ad tion in an engine\" is being surplusage. Proposal 31 \u2014One commentator re\u00ad quested that a better definition be used in \u00a7 33.89 (b) for the term \"extreme am\u00ad bient temperature and altitude.\" The FAA agrees that, taken literally, the re\u00ad quirement could be unnecessarily bur\u00ad densome. Accordingly, the wording is modified to read \"maximum and mini\u00ad mum operating ambient temperature\" and \"maximum operating altitude.\" In addition, upon further consideration, the last sentence of the proposed require\u00ad ment is deleted as unnecessary. Proposal < 3 2 \u2014One commentator be\u00ad lieved that for the overhaul test ofRULES AND REGULATIONS \u00a7 33.90 two starts per hour was unneces\u00ad sarily severe and suggested that a num\u00ad ber representative of intended operation might be substituted for the stated re\u00ad quirement. The FAA agrees that if the applicant could show that a lesser num\u00ad ber of starts would be more representa\u00ad tive of intended operation for the parti\u00ad cular engine that this would adequately comply with the intent of the section, and the section is revised accordingly. Fur\u00ad thermore, since this revision eliminates the distinction in the section between airplane and rotorcraft engines, the re\u00ad quirement is expressed in a single para\u00ad graph, rather than in (a) and (b) as proposed. In response to several comments, \u00a7 33.90 as adopted is revised to clarify that the requirement applies only to en\u00ad gines being originally type certificated; it does not apply to engines being cer\u00ad tificated through amendments to exist\u00ad ing type certificates or through supple\u00ad mental type certification procedures. Several commentators recommended deleting the entire section as proposed. They expressed the opinion that it it was unreasonable to require the completion of an overhaul test in addition to the endurance test as a condition of type certification and believed that past prac\u00ad tices were adequate to establish an ini\u00ad tial overhaul period. One commentator stated that the 150 hour endurance test, because of its accelerated nature, should be equivalent to a 1000 hour overhaul period. The FAA does not agree. This ad\u00ad ditional overhaul test is necessary since experience on certain engines has shown that the endurance test has not been equivalent to longer service operations, especially for periods as long as 1000 hours. Proposal 33 \u2014Several commentators pointed out that the oil tank require\u00ad ment in paragraph (c) of* proposed \u00a7 33.91 was redundant with a similar requirement in proposed \u00a7 33.71 (c)(9 ) . The specified test requirements for oil tanks are covered under \u00a7 33.71 (c) (9) and reference to oil tanks is, therefore, not included in \u00a7 33.91(c) as adopted. References to \"extreme tem\u00ad perature\" and \"the sum of 5 p.s.i. and the maximum operating pressure\" in the requirements specified in \u00a7 33.91(c) have been revised for reasons discussed in connection with Proposal 20, this Part (\u00a7 33.71). In addition, and for the same reason, references to \"extreme temper\u00ad ature\" in \u00a7 33.91(d) have been replaced by \"maximum and minimum operating temperature\", and the requirement to test while cycling operating conditions from \"one extreme to another\" has been rewritten to require cycling between maximum and minimum operating conditions. Proposal 34 \u2014Several commentators expressed the opinion that the tests re\u00ad quired under \u00a7 33.92 are unnecessary for engines that are to be used in single en\u00ad gine aircraft. One commentator further suggested that the time period of 3 hours may not be appropriate to a practicalsituation but rather, the time period and r.p.m. should be based upon the condi\u00ad tions arising from a recommended flight technique following an engine failure at a critical point in the flight path. An\u00ad other commentator expressed doubt that windmilling for 3 hours without oil was a normal expectancy. The FAA does not agree. It is not possible, at the time of certification, to know the end use or particular intended flight conditions for each engine. It is therefore necessary to establish a general criterion which will adequately demonstrate a degree of safety for conditions that a turbine en\u00ad gine would likely encounter on a typical and usual route structure. The 3 hour time period specified does represent a time period representative of an expected route structure and windmilling for 3 hours without oil is a reasonable possibility. One commentator recommended that the proposed rule be clarified to specifi\u00ad cally allow for the engine windmilling speed to either decrease or stop due to freezing of bearings. The proposal as written does not specifically mention this condition. However, the FAA agrees that this would be a satisfactory means of ac\u00ad complishing the intent of the section and the rule is revised to allow for this condition. One commentator recommended dele\u00ad tion of the entire section because he be\u00ad lieved there was insufficient experience pointing out a need for these tests and because the proposal implies a flight test as a condition of engine certification. The FAA finds that experience establishes the need for these tests and points out that flight tests are not specifically re\u00ad quired by the rule. Proposal 35 \u2014The changes to \u00a7 33.93 are similar to those made for \u00a733.55, which was the subject of similar com\u00ad ments. The changes and comments are discussed in connection with Proposal 1 3 , this Part. Proposal 36 \u2014The changes to \u00a7 33.99 are similar to those made for \u00a7 33.57, which was the subject of similar com\u00ad ments. The changes and comments are discussed in connection with Proposal 14, this Part. Finally, it should be noted that a num\u00ad ber of the rule changes contained in this Amendment deal with subjects for which proposals were received for inclusion in the 1974-75 Airworthiness Review Pro\u00ad gram (Notice 74-5; 39 FR 5785). As in\u00ad dicated in Notice 74- 5A (39 FR 18662), inviting comment on the proposals received, rule making pro\u00ad cedures separate from the Airworthiness Review could result in removal of pro\u00ad posals from further consideration during the Airworthiness Review Program. The FAA was determined that the following FAA proposals presently being processed in the 1974-75 Airworthiness Review re\u00ad late to issues that are covered by the rules adopted by these Amendments, and need not, and will not, be given further FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 RULES AND REGULATIONS 35459 consideration during the 1974-75 Air\u00ad worthiness Review: 23.1305\u2014 ..

These amendments are made under th e authority of sections 313(a), 601, and 6 0 3 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (4 9 U.S.C. 1354(a), 1421, and 1423), and of section 6(c) of the Department of Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. 1655(c)). In consideration of the foregoing, Parts 1, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, and 33 of the Federal Aviation regulations are amended as follows, effective October 31, 1 9 7 4 : PART 1\u2014 DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS 1 . Section 1.1 is amended to change the definition of \"Aircraft engine\" and by adding new definitions \"idle thrust\" , takeoff augmented thrust\", and \"rated maximum continuous augmented thrust\" ; by amending the definitions of \"rated takeoff thrust\", \" rated maximum continuous thrust\" ; and by adding a new paragraph (3) to the definition of \"type\" to read as follows: \u00a7 1.1 General definitions. \"Aircraft engine\" means an engine that is used or intended to be used for propelling aircraft.

FEDERAL EN ERGY ADMINISTRATION REPUBLICATION OF CERTAIN REGULATIONS 35472 Title 10\u2014 Energy CHAPTER II\u2014 FEDERAL ENERGY ADMINISTRATION Republication of Certain Regulations Since the issuance of the Mandatory Petroleum Allocation and Price R\u00e9gula- . tions (Chapter II, Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations) on January 14, 1974, the Federal Energy Administration has issued several significant amend\u00ad ments and revisions to those regulations. In addition, Parts 202, 203, 204, and 215 have been added to FEA's regulations. From time to time, minor changes of a technical or clarifying nature have also been necessary. In order to provide a compilation of its regulations r\u00eaflecting these changes, FEA is hereby republishing its regulations other than the Mandatory Petroleum Price Regulations. This republication in\u00ad corporates all changes made in FEA's regulations and published in the Federal Register through September 27, 1974. The Mandatory Petroleum Price Regu\u00ad lations (10 CFR Part 212), however, are not included in this republication. FEA anticipates that a compilation and repub\u00ad lication of Part 212 will be issued in the near future. Furthermore, this republication does not represent the conclusion of any pro\u00ad posed rulemaking outstanding on Sep\u00ad tember 23, 1974. Such proposals are still under consideration by FEA and will be concluded by issuance of final regula\u00ad tions or other appropriate action. FEA believes that this compilation will be useful in providing a single reference to FEA's regulations as they currently exist, other than Part 212. Of course, the conclusion of outstanding proposed rule- makings will mean revisions of this re\u00ad publication to a certain extent in the future. Thus, it will be necessary for users of this compilation to determine whether changes to these regulations have been made since the date of this republication. Until the compilation and any revision of the Mandatory Petroleum Price Regulations is issued, guidance with respect to FEA's price regulations must be sought with reference to the January 14, 1974 regulations as revised since that date. This republication incorporates only minor changes to correct typographical errors and other minor errors which have appeared in the r\u00e9gulations as pre\u00ad viously published in the Federal Regis\u00ad ter. Since this republication does not make any substantive change in the ex\u00ad isting regulations, it is not necessary to provide notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, or any delay in effective date under either section 7 (i) of the Federal Energy Ad\u00ad ministration Act of 1974 or (5 U.S.C. 553). And, in any event, because this is merely a republication of existing regula\u00ad tions, good cause exists for making this republication effective immediately.

Subpart A\u2014 Production or Disclosure Under 5 U.S.C. 552 \u00a7 202.1 Purpose and scope. This subpart contains the regulations of the Federal Energy Administration (FEA) implementing 5 U.S.C. 552. The regulations of this subpart provide infor\u00ad mation concerning the procedures by which records may be obtained from all divisions within the FEA. Official records of the FEA made available pursuant to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552 shall be furnished to members of the public as prescribed by this subpart. Officers and employees of the FEA may furnish to the public, informally and without compli\u00ad ance with the procedures prescribed herein, information and records of types which prior to enactment of 5 U.S.C. 552 were furnished customarily in the regular performance of their duties to the public by other agencies. Persons seeking infor\u00ad mation or records of the FEA may find it useful to consult with FEA's Office of Public Affairs before invoking the formal procedures set out below. To the extent permitted by other laws, the FEA will make available records which it is au\u00adthorized to withhold under 5 U.S.C. 552 unless it determines that such disclosure is not in the public interest. \u00a7 202.2 Public reference facilities. , (a) The National Office, FEA and Regional Offices, FEO will maintain in a public reading room or public reading area, the materials relating to that office which are required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a) (2) and 552(a) (4) to be made available for public inspection and copying. These materials will also be available at some additional locations within specific re\u00ad gions; their addresses and telephone numbers may be obtained from the Regional Offices, FEA, listed in \u00a7 205.12 of this chapter. (b) Each of these public reference facilities will maintain and make avail\u00ad able for public inspection and copying a current index of the materials available at that facility which are required to be indexed by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), and the National Office, FEA will maintain and make available for public inspection and copying copies of all such indexes. \u00a7 202.3 Requests for identifiable records andcopies. (a) Addressed to the Director of Pub\u00ad lic Affairs. A request for a record of the FEA which is not customarily made available and which is not available in a public reference facility as described in \u00a7 202.2 shall be addressed to the Director of Public Affairs, Federal Energy Admin\u00ad istration, Washington, D.C. 20461, and should be clearly marked on the envel\u00ad ope \"Attention; Information Access Offi\u00ad cer\". , (b) Request should be in writing and for identifiable records. A request for ac\u00ad cess to records should be submitted in writing and should sufficiently identify the records requested to enable FEA personnel to locate them with a reason\u00ad able amount of effort. Where possible, specific information regarding dates, titles,- file designations, and other in\u00ad formation which may help identify the records should be supplied by the re\u00ad quester. If the request relates to a matter in pending litigation, the court and its location should be identified. (c) Form may be requested. Where the information supplied by the requester is not sufficient to permit location of the records by FEA personnel with a reason\u00ad able amount of effort, the requester may be sent and asked to fill out and return a form which is designed to elicit the necessary information, pursuant to \u00a7 202.4(a). (d) Categorical requests \u2014 (1) Must meet identifiable records requirement. A request for all records falling within a reasonably specific category shall be re\u00ad garded as conforming to the statutory requirement that records be identifiable if it can reasonably be determined which particular records are sought in the re\u00ad quests, and the records can be searched for, collected, and produced without un\u00ad duly burdening or interfering with FEA operations because of the staff time con\u00ad sumed or the resulting disruption of files. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 3 9 , N O . 1 9 1 \u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1 , 1 9 7 4 (2) Assistance in reformulating non- conforming requests. If it is determined that a categorical request would unduly burden or interfere with the operations of the FEA under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the response denying the request on those grounds shall specify the reasons why and the extent to which compliance would burden or '.nterfere with FEA operations, and shall extend to the requester an opportunity to confer with knowledgeable FEA personnel in an attempt to restate the request or re\u00ad duce the request to manageable propor\u00ad tions by reformulation and by agreeing on an orderly procedure for the produc\u00ad tion of the records. (e) Requests for records of other agen\u00ad cies. Some of the records in the files of the FEA have been obtained from other federal agencies. Where it is determined that the question of the availability of requested records is primarily the re\u00ad sponsibility of another federal agency and and that such records may be ex\u00ad empt under 5 U.S.C. 552(b), the Infor\u00ad mation Access Officer will inquire of the originating agency as to whether it con\u00ad curs in release of the records. If that agency does not concur, the Information Access Officer will refer the request to the originating agency, and inform the re\u00ad quester of the appropriate official with whom to pursue his request. The FEA will accompany such referral with a recommendation, based on the interest of FEA in such records, concerning the disclosure of the requested records. \u00a7 202.4 Time for response to request for records. (a) Response prepared by Information Access Officer. An Information Access Officer, appointed by the Director of Pub\u00ad lic Affairs, shall be responsible for proc\u00ad essing written requests for records sub\u00ad mitted pursuant to this part. Upon re\u00ad ceiving such a request, the Information Access Officer shall ascertain which di\u00ad vision or divisions of the FEA have pri\u00ad mary responsibility for, custody of, or concern with the records requested and forward the request to such division or divisions, who shall promptly identify and review the records encompassed by the request. After reviewing the ma\u00ad terial, the division or divisions concerned slmll forward to the Information Access Officer either the requested material, a recommendation that the request be wholly or partially denied, or a recom\u00ad mendation that an interim response be made under the provisions of this sub\u00ad section. A recommendation of an interim response shall specify the type of re\u00ad sponse suggested and the reasons for rec\u00ad ommending an interim response. Any recommendation that a request be denied shall set forth the policy considerations supporting such denial and shall be for\u00ad warded, with the information sought or a representative sample thereof, by the In\u00ad formation Access Officer to the General counsel for his review and recommenda- .

Such an interim response shall specify (A) the reason or reasons for delay in granting or denying the request; (B) any further information needed by the FEA from the requester; (C) the agency to whom the request has been referred, if any, and the name of the appropriate official of that agency with whom to pursue the matter; and (D) the expected time with\u00ad in which the request of records will be either granted or denied. All requests for which an interim response is made stat\u00ad ing that further time is needed to col\u00ad lect and prepare the records, or to eval\u00ad uate the status of the request under the Freedom of Information Act, shall ,e either granted or denied, or granted in part and denied in part, within 10 days of receipt of the request by the Director of Public Affairs, except that if circum\u00ad stances require additional time before a decision on a request can be reached, and the person requesting records is promptly informed in writing of these circumstances and the Information Ac\u00ad cess Officer certifies to such person that such delay is unavoidable, the decision may be made within 20 days of receipt of the request by the Director of Public A f\u00ad fairs. A response granting a request or stating that the information will be avail\u00ad able within 10 days or less of receipt of the request may be issued by officers or employees of FEA other than the Infor\u00ad mation Access Officer: Provided, That a copy of such response is forwarded to the Information Access Officer. (b) Petition if response not forthcom\u00ad ing. If the Information Access Officer does not respond to or acknowledge a request for records within 48 hours, or does not act on a request within an ex\u00ad tended deadline, as provided for in para\u00ad graph (a) of this section, or if the requester believes an extended deadline adopted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is unreasonable, the requester may petition the Deputy Administrator to take appropriate measures to assure prompt action on the request. (c) For purposes of this section, the term \" division\" includes all administra\u00ad tive or operating units of \u00a7 202.5 Responses by Information Ac\u00ad cess Officer: Form and content.

A reply denying a written request for a record shall be in writing signed by the Information Access Officer and shall include: (1) Exemption category. A reference to the specific exemption under the Freedom of Information Act authorizing the withholdings of the record, and to the extent consistent with the purposes of the exemption, a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record withheld, and, if the Information Access Officer considers it appropriate, a state\u00ad ment of why the exempt record is being withheld; and, (2) Administrative appeal and judicial review. A statement that the denial may be appealed within 30 days to the Deputy Administrator, and that judicial review will be thereafter available either in the district in which the requester resides or has a principal place of business or in which the agency records, are situated. (c) Denial because record cannot be located or does not exist. If a requested record is known to have been destroyed or otherwise disposed of, or if no such record was ever known to exist, the re\u00ad quester shall be so notified. \u00a7 202.6 Appeals to the Deputy Admin\u00ad istrator from initial denials. (a) Appeal to Deputy Administrator. When the Information Access Officer has denied a request for records in whole or in part, the requester may, within 30 days of its receipt, appeal the denial to the Deputy Administrator, FEA, Wash\u00ad ington, D.C. The appeal shall be in writing. (b) Action within 10 days. The Deputy Administrator will act upon the appeal within 10 days of its receipt, and more rapidly if practicable, except that if novel or difficult questions are involved, the Deputy Administrator may extend the time for final action by him for an additional 20 days upon notifying the requester of the reasons for the ex\u00ad tended deadline and the date on which a final response may be expected. (c) Form of action on appeal. The Deputy Administrator's action on an ap\u00ad peal shall be in writing. A denial in whole or in part of a request on appeal shall set forth the exemption relied on, a brief explanation consistent with the purpose of the exemption of how the ex\u00ad emption applies to the records withheld, and the reasons for asserting it. \u00a7 202.7 Maintenance of files. (a) Maintenance of file open to public. The Information Access Officer shall maintain a file, open to the public, which shall contain copies of all grants or denials of all requests for information or appeals made under this subpart. The material shall be indexed by the exemp\u00ad tion asserted by the FEA, if any, and, to the extent feasible, according to the type of records requested. (b) Protection of privacy. Where the identity of a requester, or other identify\u00ad ing details related to a request, would constitute an invasion of a personal FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 35474 privacy if made generally available, the Information Access Officer shall delete identifying details from the copies of documents maintained in the public file established under paragraph (a) of this section, \u00a7 202.8 Fees for provision of records. (a) When charged. User fees pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 483a (1970), shall be charged according to the schedule contained in paragraph (b) of this section for services rendered in responding to requests for FEA records under this subpart unless the Information Access Officer deter\u00ad mines, in conformity with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 483, that such charges or a portion thereof are not in the public interest. Such a determination shall ordinarily not be made unless the service to be performed will be of benefit pri\u00ad marily to the public as opposed to the re\u00ad quester, or unless the requester is an indigent individual. Fees shall not be charged where they would amount, in the aggregate, for a request or series of re\u00ad lated requests, to less than $3, Ordinarily, fees shall not be charged if the records requested are not found, or if all of the records located are withheld as exempt. However, if the time expended in proc\u00ad essing the request is substantial, and if the requester has been notified of the estimated cost pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section and has been specifically advised that it cannot be determined in advance whether any records will be made available, fees may be charged. (b ) Services charged for, and amount charged. For the services listed below ex\u00ad pended in locating or making available records or copies thereof, the following charges shall be assessed: (1) Copies.

For each one quarter hour spent by clerical personnel in excess of the first quarter hour in searching for and producing a requested record, $1.25. (3) Monitoring inspection. For each one quarter hour spent in monitoring the requester's inspection of records, $1.25. (4) Certification. For certification of true copies, each, $1. (5) Nonroutine, nonclerical searches. Where a search cannpt be performed by clerical personnel, for example, where the task of determining which records fall within a request and collecting them requires the time of professional or man\u00ad agerial personnel, and where the amount of time that must be expended in the search and collection of the requested records by such higher level personnel is substantial, charges for the search may be made at a rate in excess of the clerical rate, namely for each one quarter hour spent in excess of the first quarter hour by such higher level personnel in search\u00ad ing for a requested record, $3.75. (6) Examination and related tasks in screening records. No charge shall be made for time spent in resolving legal or policy issues affecting access to records of known contents. In addition, no charge shall ordinarily be made for the timeRULES AND REGULATIONS involved in examining records to deter\u00ad mine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure and should be withheld as a matter of sound policy. However, where a broad request requires FEA personnel to devote a substantial amount of time to examining records for the purpose of screening out certain rec\u00ad ords or portions thereof in accordance with determinations that material of such a nature is exempt and should be withheld as a matter of sound policy, a fee may be assessed for the time con\u00ad sumed in such examination. Where such examination can be performed by clerical personnel, a fee may be assessed at the rate of $1.25 per quarter hour, and where higher level personnel are required, a fee may be assessed at the rate of $3.75 per quarter hour. (7) Computerized Records. Fees for services in processing requests main\u00ad tained in whole or part in computerized form shall be in accordance with this section so far as practicable. Services of personnel in the nature of a search will be charged for at rates prescribed in paragraph (b) (5) of this section unless the level of personnel involved permits rates in accordance with paragraph (b) (2) of this section. A charge may be made for the computer time involved, based upon the prevailing level of costs to governmental organizations and upon the particular types of computer and as\u00ad sociated equipment and the amounts of time on such equipment that are utilized. A charge may also be made for any sub\u00ad stantial amounts of special supplies or materials used to contain, present, or make available the output of computers, based upon prevailing levels of costs to governmental organizations and upon the type and amount of such supplies or materials that is used. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to entitle any person, as of right, to any services in connection with computerized rec\u00ad ords, other than services to which such person may be entitled under 5 U.S.C. 552 and under the provisions, not includ\u00ad ing paragraph (b) of this subpart. (c) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25. Where it is anticipated that the fees chargeable under this section will amount to more than $25, and the re\u00ad quester has not indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated, the requester shall be promptly notified by the Information Ac\u00ad cess Officer of the amount of the antici\u00ad pated fee or such portion thereof as can readily be estimated. An advance deposit may be required. The notice or request for an advance deposit shall extend an offer to the requester to confer with knowledgeable FEA personnel in an at\u00ad tempt to reformulate the request in a manner which will reduce the fees and meet the needs of the requester. Dis\u00ad patch by certified mail of such a notice or request shall toll the running of the period for response by the FEA until a reply is received from the requester. (d) Form of payment. Payment should be made by check or money order pay\u00ad able to the Treasury of the United States.\u00a7 202.9 Exemptions.

(a) In order to assure that the busi\u00ad ness of FEA is conducted effectively, ob\u00ad jectively and without improper influence or appearance thereof, all employees must be persons of integrity and observe unquestionable standards of behavior. An employee shall not engage in criminal, Infamous, dishonest, immoral, or dis\u00ad graceful conduct or other conduct preju\u00ad dicial to the Government. An employeemust avoid conflicts of his private inter\u00ad ests with his public duties and responsi\u00ad bilities. Also, he must not do indirectly that which is improper for him to do di\u00ad rectly. For example, members of his fam\u00ad ily may not accomplish for him that which he, himself may not do. The pro\u00ad priety of any activity must be considered in relation to general ethical standards of the highest order. (b) This part is intended to foster the foregoing concepts. It is issued in com\u00ad pliance with the requirements of Execu\u00ad tive Order No. 11222 of May 8, 1965, and is based upon the provisions of that order, the regulations of the Civil Service Commission issued thereunder (Part 735 of 5 CFR, Chapter I), and the statutes cited elsewhere in this part. (c) This part, among other things, re\u00ad flects prohibitions and requirements im\u00ad posed by the criminal and civil laws of the United States. However, the paraphrased restatements of criminal and civil stat\u00ad utes contained in this part are designed for information purposes only and in no way constitute an interpretation or con\u00ad struction thereof that is binding upon the Federal Government. Moreover, this part does not purport to-paraphrase or enumerate all restrictions or require\u00ad ments imposed by statutes, Executive Orders, regulations or otherwise upon Federal employees and former Federal employees. The omission of a reference to any such restriction or requirement in no way alters the legal effect of that restriction or requirement and any such restriction or requirement, as the case may be, continues to be applicable to em\u00ad ployees in accordance with its own terms. Furthermore, attorneys employed by FEA are subject to the Code of Professional Responsibility and, where applicable, the canons of Professional Ethics of the American Bar Association. \u00a7 203.2 Applicability. (a) The regulations in this part apply to all officers and employees of FEA. (b) Except where specifically provided otherwise, or where limited in terms or by the context to regular employees, all provisions of this part relating to em\u00ad ployees are applicable also to special Government employees. \u00a7 203.3 Definitions. In this part\u2014 (a) \" Employee\" or \"regular employee\" means an officer or employee of FEA but does not include a special Government employee. (b) \"FEA\" means the Federal Energy Administration. (c) \"Person\" means an individual, a corporation, a company, an association, a firm, a partnership, a society, a joint stock company, or any other organiza\u00ad tion or institution. (d) \"Special Government employee\" means an officer or employee of FEA who is retained, designated, appointed, or employed to perform, with or without compensation, for not to exceed 130 days during any period of 365 consecutive days, temporary duties, either on a full\u00ad time or intermittent basis.

(b) All employees should conduct themselves off the job in such a manner as not to reflect adversely upon FEA or the Federal service. (c) In all circumstances employees should conduct themselves so as to ex\u00ad emplify the highest standards of integ\u00ad rity. An employee should avoid any ac\u00ad tion, whether or not specifically prohibited by this part, which might re\u00ad sult in, or create the appearance of: (1) Using public office for private gain; (2) Giving preferential treatment to any person; (3) Impeding Government efficiency or economy; (4) Losing complete independence or impartiality; (5) Making a Government decision outside official channels; or (6) Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the integrity of the Government. \u00a7 203.5 Responsibilities of supervisors and employees.

Employees are encouraged to consult these basic materials in any case of doubt as to the proper application or in\u00ad terpretation of the provisions of this part. Regional Counselors shall provide such materials to personnel of the regions. (d) Attention of all employees is di\u00ad rected to House Concurrent Resolution 175, 85th Congress, 2d session, 72 Stat. B12, the \"Code of Ethics for Government Service\", which is attached to this part as Appendix A.\u00a7 203.6 Interpretation and advisory service : counseling.

(2) Render authoritative advice and guidance on matters covered by the reg\u00ad ulations in this part which are presented to him by employees, special Govern\u00ad ment employees, management or person\u00ad nel offices in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area; and (3) Receive information on and re\u00ad solve or forward to the Administrator of FEA for consideration conflicts or ap\u00ad parent conflicts which appear in the Statements of Employment and Finan\u00ad cial Interests submitted under this part, which are not resolved at a lower level. (c) The Regional Counsels are desig\u00ad nated Regional Counselors for all em\u00ad ployees of FEA at the Regional level within their respective regions. Regional Counselors shall: (1) Give authoritative advice and guidance when requested to employees, special Government employees, manage\u00ad ment officials and personnel offices within their areas of jurisdiction. (2) Receive information on and at\u00ad tempt to resolve, or refer to the Coun\u00ad selor for FEA, conflicts of interest or appearances of conflicts of interest in Statements of Employment and Finan\u00ad cial Interests submitted by employees and special Government employees to whom they are required to give advice and guidance, which are not resolved at lower levels. (d) Communications between the Counselor and Regional Counselors and an employee shall be confidential, except as deemed necessary by the Administra\u00ad tor or the Counselor to carry out the purposes of this part. (e) Supervisors shall advise employees who come to them with questiona on matters covered by the regulations in this part, or, as they consider appro\u00ad priate, shall refer such questions to the Counselor or Regional Counselors who have been designated in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. (f) The Counselor for FEA shall notify all employees and special Govern\u00ad ment employees of the availability of counseling services. Such notification shall be made within 30 days after the effective date of this part, and periodi\u00ad cally thereafter. (1) The names and addresses of the Counselor and Regional Counselors win be made available to employees by appro\u00ad priate bulletins, circulars, or other re\u00ad leases of a current nature.

(b) Any disciplinary or remedial action taken pursuant to this part shall be effected in accordance with any appli\u00ad cable laws, Executive Orders, an d regulations. \u00a7 203.8 Conflicts of interest. (a) A conflict of interest may exist whenever an employee has a personal or private interest in a matter which in\u00ad volves his duties and responsibilities a s an employee. The maintenance of public confidence in Government clearly de\u00ad mands that an employee take no action which would constitute the use of h is official position to advance his personal or private interests. (b) Neither the pertinent statutes nor the standards of conduct prescribed in this part are to be regarded as com \u00ad pletely comprehensive. Each employee must, in each instance involving a per\u00ad sonal or private interest in a matter which also involves his duties and re\u00ad sponsibilities as an employee, make cer\u00ad tain that his actions do not have th e effect or the appearance of the use of his official position for the furtherance of his own interests or those of h is family or his business associates. (c) The principal statutory provisions relating to bribery, graft, and conflicts of interest are contained in Chapter 1 1 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 201-224. Severe penalties are provided for viola\u00ad tions, including fine, imprisonment, dis\u00ad missal from office, and disqualification from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States. \u00a7 203.9 Disqualification because of pri\u00ad vate financial interests.

(1) For purposes of this section\u2014 (i) An employee participates person\u00ad ally and substantially in a particular matter through decision, approval, dis\u00ad approval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise; (ii) A particular matter is a judicial or other proceeding, application, request FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 RULES AND REGULATIONS 35477 for ruling or other determination, ton- tract, claim, controversy, charge, accusa\u00ad tion or arrest, and (iii) A financial Interest is the interest of the employee himself or his spouse, minor child, partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, director, trustee, partner, or employee, or any per\u00ad son or organization with whom he is ne\u00ad gotiating or has any arrangement con\u00ad cerning prospective employment. (b) An employee who has a financial interest (other than a financial interest exempted under this paragraph or para\u00ad graph (c) of this section) in a particular matter which is within the scope of his official duties shall make a full disclosure of that interest to both his supervisor and the Counselor or a Regional Counse\u00ad lor in writing. He shall not participate in such matter unless and until he receives a written determination by the Admin\u00ad istrator of FEA pursuant to section 208 of Title 18, United States Code, that the interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the services which the Government may expect of him. No such determination can be effective until the procedures of paragraph (d) of this section are met. An employee seeking such a determina\u00ad tion must submit a written request to the General Counsel of FEA which describes: (1) the interest concerning which a conflict or potential conflict exists; (2) the duties of the employee; (3) the nature of the conflict, potential conflict, or appearance of a conflict of interest; and (4) the reason why the con\u00ad flict is not likely to affect the employee's services to FEA. The General Counsel shall review all requests submitted pur\u00ad suant to this paragraph and make such recommendations to the Administrator as he deems appropriate. If the Admin\u00ad istrator does not make a determination that the financial interest should be ex\u00ad empted, he shall direct such remedial action as may be appropriate under the Provisions of \u00a7 203.27. (c) Pursuant to the provisions of sec\u00ad tion 208(b) (2) of Title 18, United States Code, the Administrator hereby exempts financial interests in widely diversified mutual funds from the restrictions of paragraph (a) of this section and of sec\u00ad tion 208(a) of Title 18 as being too re\u00ad mote or inconsequential to affect the integrity of an employee's services in a matter, provided that no exemption un\u00ad der this paragraph can be effective until the procedures of paragraph (d) of this section are met. id) in order to give effect to the ex\u00ad emptions provided for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Administrator shall: , ^ Send to Congress, ten days prior Jo the effective date of any such exemp- f\u00bbh a\u00ab W 1 ^ ^ n report, containing notice intention to invoke subsection 208 + h \u00b0I I\u00ae* United States Code, a de\u00ad tailed statement of the subject matter concerning which a conflict exists; and in tne case of an exemption set forth in Paragraph (b) of this section, the nature officer's or employee's financial in- fnr^K *or 1 1 1 case \u00b0f an exemption set mrtn in paragraph (c) of this section,the name and statement of financial in\u00ad terest of each person who will come with\u00ad in such exemption; and (2) Publish such written report in the Federal Register . \u00a7 203.10 Additional prohibitions\u2014 regu\u00ad lar employees.

(1) He may not, except in the dis\u00ad charge of his official duties, represent anyone else before a court or Govern\u00ad ment agency in a matter in which the United States is a party or has an in\u00ad terest. This prohibition applies both to paid and unpaid representation of an\u00ad other (18 U.S.C. 203 and 205). (2) He may not, after his Government employment has ended, represent any\u00ad one other than the United States in connection with a matter in which the United States is a party or has an in\u00ad terest and in which he participated personally and substantially for the Gov\u00ad ernment (18 U.S.C. 207(a)). (3) He may not for 1 year after his Government employment has ended, represent anyone other than the United States in connection with a matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and which was within the boundaries of his official responsibil\u00ad ity during the last year of his Govern\u00ad ment service (18 U.S.C. 207(b)). (This temporary restraint is permanent if the matter is one in which he participated personally and substantially. See para\u00ad graph (a) (2) of this section.) (4) He may not receive any salary, or supplementation of his Government salary, from a private source as compen\u00ad sation for his services to the Govern\u00ad ment (18 U.S.C. 209). (See \u00a7203.13.) (b) Exemptions or exceptions from the prohibitions described in paragraph (a) of this section are permitted under cer\u00ad tain circumstances in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 203.12. \u00a7 203.11 Conduct and responsibilities of special Government employees. (a) In addition to the disqualification described in \u00a7 203.9, a special Govern\u00ad ment employee is subject to the following major prohibitions. (1) He may not, except in the dis\u00ad charge of his official duties\u2014 (1) Represent anyone else before a court or Government agency in a matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and in which he has at any time participated personally and substantially for the, Government (18 U.S.C. 203 and 205), or (ii) Represent anyone else in a mat\u00ad ter pending before FEA unless he served there no more than 60 days during the previous 365 days (18 U.S.C. 203 and 205). He is bound by this restraint de\u00ad spite the fact that the matter is not one in which he has ever participated per\u00ad sonally and substantially. (2) He may not, after his Govern\u00ad ment employment has ended, represent anyone other than the United States in connection with a matter in which theUnited States is a party or has an in\u00ad terest and in which he participated per\u00ad sonally and substantially for the Govern\u00ad ment (18 U.S.C. 207(a)). (3) He may not, for 1 year after his Government employment has ended, rep\u00ad resent anyone other than the United States in connection with a matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and which was within the boundaries of his official responsibility during the last year of his Government service (18 U.S.C. 207(b)). (This tem\u00ad porary restraint is permanent if the mat\u00ad ter is one in which he participated per\u00ad sonally and substantially. See paragraph (a) (2) of this section). (b) Exemptions or exceptions from the prohibitions described in pragraph (a) of this section are permitted under cer\u00ad tain circumstances, in accordance with the provisibns of paragraph (d) of \u00a7 203.12. (c) A special Government employee must conduct himself according to ethi\u00ad cal behavior of the highest order. In particular, (1) He must refrain from any use of his office which is, or appears to be moti\u00ad vated by a private gain for himself or other persons, particularly those with whom he has family, business, or finan\u00ad cial ties. The fact that the desired gain, if it materializes, will not take place at the expense of the Government makes his actions no less improper. (2) He must conduct himself in a manner devoid of any suggestion that he is exploiting his Government em\u00ad ployment for private advantage. He must not, on the basis of any inside information, enter into any speculation or recommend speculation to members of his family or business associates, in commodities, land, or the securities of any private company. He must obey this injunction even though his duties have no connection whatever with the Government programs or activities which may affect the value of such commodi\u00ad ties, land, or securities. He should be careful in his personal financial activi\u00ad ties to avoid any appearance of acting on the basis of information obtained in the course of his Government work. (3) He must not use information not generally available to those outside the Government for the special benefit of a business or other entity by which he is employed or retained or in which he has a financial interest. Information not available to private industry should re\u00ad main confidential in his hands and not divulged to his private employer or cli\u00ad ent. In cases of doubt whether informa\u00ad tion is generally available to the public, the special Government employee should confer with the person who assigns work to him, with the office having functional responsibility for a specific type of in\u00ad formation, or, as appropriate, with the Director of Public Affairs or the officials designated in \u00a7 203.6 to give interpreta\u00ad tive and advisory service. (4) He must, where requested by a private enterprise to act for it in a con\u00ad sultant or advisory capacity and the re\u00ad quest appears motivated by the desire for inside information, make a choice be- FEDERAL REGISTER, V O L 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 35478 tween acceptance of the tendered private employment and continuation of his Government consultancy. He may not engage in both. (5) He must not use his position in any way to coerce, or give the appear\u00ad ance of coercing, anyone to provide a fi\u00ad nancial benefit to him or another per\u00ad son, particularly one with whom he has family, business, or financial ties. (6) Special government employees are subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of \u00a7 203.14, regarding solici\u00ad tation and receipt of gifts, gratuities, loans, entertainment, favors and other things of value by regular employees. (7) He may teach, lecture, publish, or write in a manner not inconsistent with the provisions of \u00a7 203.16 governing such activities for regular employees. (d) A special Government employee who has questions about conflicts of in\u00ad terest or the application of the regula\u00ad tions in this part to him or his assigned work should make inquiry of the person who assigns his work. That person will direct him to the Counselor or a Region\u00ad al Counselor for interpretative and ad\u00ad visory services. (e) Attention of special Government employees is directed to the provisions of \u00a7 203.2 making the provisions of this part generally applicable to their activi\u00ad ties. \u00a7 203.12 Exemptions and exceptions from prohibitions of conflict of inter\u00ad est statutes. (a) Nothing in this part shall be deemed to prohibit an employee, if it is not otherwise inconsistent with the faithful performance of his duties, from acting without compensation as agent or attorney for any person in a disciplinary, loyalty, or other Federal personnel ad\u00ad ministration proceeding involving such person. (b) Nothing in this part shall be deemed to prohibit an employee from acting, with or without compensation, as agent or attorney for his parents, spouse, child, or any person for whom, or for any estate for which, he is serving as guard\u00ad ian, executor, administrator, trustee, or other personal fiduciary, except in those matters in which he has participated per\u00ad sonally and substantially as a Govern\u00ad ment employee, through decision, ap\u00ad proval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, or which are the subject of his official responsibility, as defined in sec\u00ad tion 202(h) of Title 18 of the United States Code, provided that the employee obtains prior approval in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 203.16 regarding outside employment. (c) Nothing in this part shall be deemed to prohibit an employee from giving testimony under oath or from making statements required to be made under penalty for perjury or contempt. (d) In addition to the exemptions and exceptions described in this section and in \u00a7 203.9 the conflict of interest statutes permit certain exemptions and excep\u00ad tions in specific circumstances. Such ex\u00ad emptions may be sought by the following procedure:RULES AND REGULATIONS (1) Any regular employee or special Government employee who desires ap\u00ad proval or certification of his activities as provided for by section 205 of Title 18, United States Code, shall make applica\u00ad tion therefor in writing to the Counselor for FEA. (2) A former employee, including a former special Government employee, who desires certification with regard to his activities under section 207 of Title 18, United States Code, shall make appli\u00ad cation therefor in writing to the Coun\u00ad selor for FEA. (3) The Counselor for FEA shall re\u00ad port promptly to the Administrator of FEA all matters reported to him under this part which require consideration of approvals, certifications, or determina\u00ad tions provided for in sections 205, 207, or 208 of Title 18, United States Code. \u00a7 203.13 Salary of employee payable only by United States. (a) No employee, other than a special Government employee or an employee serving without compensation, shall re\u00ad ceive any salary, or any contribution to or supplementation of salary, as compen\u00ad sation for his services as an employee, from any source other than the Govern\u00ad ment of the United States, except as may be contributed out of the treasury of any State, county, or municipality (18 U.S.C. 209). (b) Nothing in this part shall be deemed to prohibit an employee from continuing to participate in a bona fide pension, retirement, group life, health, or accident insurance, profit-sharing, stock bonus, or other employee welfare or benefit plan maintained by a former employer, which does not cause a con\u00ad flict of interest, appearance of conflict or potential conflict, nor from accepting contributions, awards, or other expenses under Chapter 41 of Title 5, United States Code (the Government Employees Training Act). \u00a7 203.14 Gratuities. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, FEA personnel will not solicit or accept any gift, gratuity, favor, (including complimentary meals and beverages) entertainment, loan, or any other thing of monetary value either directly or indirectly from any inter\u00ad ested party. For the purpose of this sec\u00ad tion, a gift, gratuity, favor, entertain\u00ad ment, etc., includes any tangible item, in\u00ad tangible benefits, discounts, tickets, passes, transportation, and accommo\u00ad dations or hospitality given or extended to or on behalf of the recipient. An \"in\u00ad terested party\" is any person, firm, cor\u00ad poration, or other entity which: (1) Is engaged or is endeavoring to engage in procurement activities or business or financial transactions of any sort with FEA; (2) Conducts operations or activities that are regulated by FEA; or (3) Has interests that may be substan\u00ad tially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the official duty of the FEA personnel concerned. Gifts, gratuities, favors, entertainment, etc., bestowed upon members of the im\u00admediate families of FEA personnel are viewed in the same light as those be\u00ad stowed upon FEA personnel. Acceptance of gifts, gratuities, favors, entertain\u00ad ment, etc., no matter how innocently tendered and received, from those who have or seek business with FEA may be a source of embarrassment to FEA and the personnel involved, may affect the objective judgment of the recipient and impair public confidence in the integ\u00ad rity of the business relations between FEA and industry. (b) The restrictions in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to the following: (1) Instances in which the interests of the Government are served by par\u00ad ticipation of FEA personnel in widely attended luncheons, dinners, and simi\u00ad lar gatherings sponsored by industrial, technical, and professional associations for the discussion of matters of mutual interest to Government and industry. Participation by FEA personnel is ap\u00ad propriate when the host is an associa\u00ad tion and not an interested party. Ac\u00ad ceptance of gratuities or hospitality from private companies in connection with such association's activities is prohibited. (2) Speciality advertising items of nominal intrinsic value. (3) Customary exchange of social amenities between personal friends and relatives when motivated by such rela\u00ad tionship and extended on a personal basis. (4) Things available impersonally to the general public or classes of the gen\u00ad eral public, such as a free exhibition by an interested party at a world's fair. (5) Trophies, entertainment, rewards, prizes, given to competitors in contests which are open to the public generally. (6) Transactions between and among relatives which are personal and consist\u00ad ent with the relationship. (7) The acceptance of loans from banks or other financial institutions on customary terms to finance proper and usual activities of employees, such a s home mortgage loans. (8) Local transportation provided by an interested party while on official busi\u00ad ness and when alternative arrangements are clearly impracticable. (9) Participation in civic and com\u00ad munity activities by FEA personnel when the relationship with the interested party can reasonably be characterized as re\u00ad mote, for example, participation in a lit\u00ad tle league or Combined Federal Cam\u00ad paign luncheon which is subsidized by an interested party. (10) The acceptance of accommoda\u00ad tions, subsistence, or services furnished in kind in connection with official travel, when authorized by the Administrator or his designee as in the overall Govern\u00ad mental interest. When accommodations, subsistence, or services in kind are fur\u00ad nished to FEA personnel by private sources, appropriate deductions shall be made in the travel, per diem, and other allowances otherwise payable to the per\u00ad sonnel. FEA personnel may not accept personal reimbursement from a private source for expenses incident to official travel, unless authorized pursuant to 5 FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 \u00dc.S.C. 4111 or other express statutory authority. Rather, any reimbursement must be made to the Government by check payable to the Treasurer of the United States; personnel will be reim\u00ad bursed by the Government in accordance with regulations relating to reimburse\u00ad ment. In no case shall FEA personnel ac\u00ad cept\u2014either in kind or on a reimbursable basis\u2014benefits which are under prudent standards extravagant or excessive in nature* (11) Situations not specifically cov\u00ad ered by paragraph (b) (1)\u2014 (10) of this section but in which, in the judgment of the individual concerned, the Govern\u00ad ment's interest will be served by partici\u00ad pation by FEA personnel in activities at the expense of an interested party and in which the Counselor has granted prior approval. When prior consultation with the Counselor is impractical, in those sit\u00ad uations in which FEA personnel are of\u00ad fered any gratuity, favor, entertainment, etc., either directly or indirectly from any interested party, and in their judgment the Government's interest is served by acceptance, FEA personn\u00e9l may accept such offer but must report the circum\u00ad stances within 48 hours to the Counselor or in the case of regional employees, the Regional Counselor. (c) Personnel on official business may not accept contractor-provided trans\u00ad portation, meals or overnight accommo\u00ad dations in connection with such official business so long as Government or com\u00ad mercial transportation or quarters are reasonably available. Where, however, the overall Governmental interest would be served by acceptance by FEA person\u00ad nel of such transportation or accommo\u00ad dations in specific cases, the Adminis\u00ad trator or his delegate may authorize it. (d) The Constitution (article I, section 9 , clause 8) prohibits acceptance from foreign governments, except with the consent of Congress, of any emolument, office, or title. The Congress has pro\u00ad vided for the receipt and disposition of foreign gifts and decorations in 5 \u00dc.S.C. 73 42 . (See also Executive Order No. 11320, 31 FR 15789, and the regulations pursuant thereto in 22 CFR Part 3 (as added, 32 FR 6569) ). Any such gift or thing which cannot appropriately be re\u00ad fused shall be submitted to the Counselor for transmittal to the State Department. \u00a7 203.15 Prohibition of contributions or presents to superiors. FEA personnel shall not solicit a con\u00ad tribution from other officers or employ\u00ad ees for a gift to an official superior, make a donation as a gift to an official superior, or accept a gift from an officer or em\u00ad ployee receiving less pay than themselves (5 U.S.C. 7351). However, this section does not prohibit a voluntary gift of nominal value or donation in nominal amount made on a special occasion such as marriage, illness or resignation. \u00a7 203.16 Outside employment and other * activity. (a) An employee shall not engage in outside employment or other outside activity not compatible with the full and proper discharge of the duties andRULES AND REGULATIONS responsibilities of his Government em\u00ad ployment. Incompatible activities in\u00ad clude, but are not limited to: (1) Acceptance of a fee, compensation, gift, payment of expense, or any other thing of monetary value in circumstances in which acceptance may result in, or create the appearance of, a conflict of interest; or (2) Outside employment which tends to impair the employee's mental or physical capacity to perform his Gov\u00ad ernment duties and responsibilities in an acceptable manner. (3) Work which identifies FEA or any employee in his official capacity with any organization commercializing products relating to work conducted by FEA or with any commercial advertising matter, or work performed under such circum\u00ad stances as to give the impression that it is an official act of FEA or represents an official point of view. (4) Outside work or activity that takes the employee's time and attention during his official work hours. (b) Within the limitations imposed by this section, employees are encour\u00ad aged to engage in teaching, lecturing, and writing. However, an employee shall not, either for or without compensation, engage in teaching, lecturing, or writing that is dependent on information ob\u00ad tained as a result of his Government employment, except when that informa\u00ad tion has been made available to the gen\u00ad eral public or will be made Available on request, or when the Administrator of FEA gives written authorization for the use of non-public information on the basis that the use is in the public In\u00ad terest. In addition, FEA personnel shall not receive compensation or anything of monetary value (such as an honorarium) for any consultation, lecture, discussion, writing, or appearance the subject matter of which is devoted substan\u00ad tially to the responsibilities, programs, or operations of FEA, or which draws sub\u00ad stantially on official data or ideas which have not become part of the body of public information. (c) An employee shall not engage in outside employment with a State or local government, except in accordance with applicable regulations of the Civil Serv\u00ad ice Commission (Part 734 of 5 CFR, Chapter I). (d) Neither this section nor \u00a7 203.14 precludes an employee from: (1) Receipt of bona fide reimburse\u00ad ment unless prohibited by law, for actual expenses for travel and such other neces\u00ad sary subsistence as is compatible with this part and for which no Government payment or reimbursement is made. (2) Participation in the activities of national or State political parties not proscribed by law. (See \u00a7 203.24 regard\u00ad ing political activities.) (3) Participation in the affairs of, or acceptance of an award for a meritori\u00ad ous public contribution or achievement given by a charitable, religious, profes\u00ad sional, social, fraternal, nonprofit ed\u00ad ucational or recreational, public serv\u00ad ice, or civic organization. (e) An employee who intends to en\u00ad gage in outside employment shall obtain35479 the advance approval of his Immediate supervisor. In addition, empolyees re\u00ad quired by \u00a7 203.25(d) to file a Confi\u00ad dential Statement of Employment and Financial Interest will also obtain ap\u00ad proval of the Counselor or, in the case of regional employees, the Regional Counselor.

In addition, a record of each approval shall be forwarded to the relevant Assistant Administrator or Office Director.

(a) An employee may not have a fi\u00ad nancial interest which\u2014 (1) Is a personal or private industry in a matter which involves his duties and responsibilities as an employee (except as permitted by \u00a7 203.9 or authorized pursuant to \u00a7 203.12(d); or (2) Is entered into in reliance upon, or as a result of, information obtained through his employment; or (3) Results from active and continu\u00ad ous trading (as distinguished from the making of bona fide investments) which is conducted on such a scale as to inter\u00ad fere with the proper performance of his duties. (b) Aside from the restrictions pre\u00ad scribed or cited in this part, employees are free to engage in lawful financial transactions to the same extent as any citizen. Employees should be aware that the financial interests of their spouses or minor children may be regarded, for the purposes of this section, as financial interests of the employees themselves. In addition, the financial interests of blood relatives who are full time resi\u00ad dents of their households may be ^re\u00ad garded as financial interests of the em\u00ad ployees themselves. (c) This section does not apply to spe\u00ad cial Government employees, who are subject to the provisions of \u00a7 203.11. \u00a7 203.18 Use of Government property. An employee shall not directly or in\u00ad directly use, or allow the use of, Govern\u00ad ment property or any kind, including property leased to the Government, for other than officially approved activities.

An employee shall not be discriminated against because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, politics, marital status, or on the basis of a physical handicap with respect to any position the duties of which may be efficiently per\u00ad formed by a person with a physical handicap. This prohibition applies to both employment and utilization of Fed\u00ad eral employees. \u00a7 203.20 Misuse of information.

(b) An officer or employee of FEA shall not divulge or disclose any trade secrets, processes, financial data or other business information which is submitted to or filed with FEA on a confidential basis and which fails within the pur\u00ad view of 18 UJ5.C. 1905. \u00a7 203.21 Indebtedness. An employee shall pay each just finan\u00ad cial obligation in a proper and timely manner, especially one imposed by law such as Federal, State, or local taxes. For the purpose of this section a \"just financial obligation\" means one acknowl\u00ad edged by the employee, or reduced to judgment by a court, and \"in a proper and timely manner\" means in a man\u00ad ner which FEA determines does not, un\u00ad der the circumstances, reflect adversely on the Government as his employer. In the event of dispute between an employee and an alleged creditor, this section does not require FEA to determine the valid\u00ad ity or amount of the disputed debt. \u00a7 203.22 Gambling, betting, and lot\u00ad teries.

(commonly known as the Hatch Act) and Civil Service Rule IV. Employees are individually responsible for refraining from prohibited political activity. Ignorance of a prohibition does not excuse a violation. This section sum\u00ad marizes provisions of law and regulation concerning political activity of em\u00ad ployees. (b ) Intermittent employees are subject to the restrictions when in active duty status only and for the entire 24 hours of any day of actual employment. (c) Employees on leave, on leave with\u00ad out pay, or on furlough or terminal leave, even though the employees' resignations have been accepted are subject to the restrictions. A separated employee who has received a lump-sum payment for annual leave, however, is not subject to the restriction during the period covered by the lump-sum payment or thereafter, provided he does not return to Federal employment during that period. An em\u00ad ployee is not permitted to take leave of absence to work with a political candi\u00ad date, committee, or organization or be\u00ad come a candidate for office with the understanding that he will resign his position if nominated or elected. (d) An employee is accountable few : political activity by another person act\u00ading as his agent or under the employee's direction or control if he is thus accom\u00ad plishing indirectly what he may not law\u00ad fully do directly and openly. (e) Section 7324 of title 5, U.S.C. (de\u00ad rived from 9(a) of the Hatch Act) pro\u00ad vides that employees have the right to vote as they please and the right to express their opinions on political sub\u00ad jects and candidates. Generally, how\u00ad ever, they are prohibited from taking an active part in political management or political campaigns or using official authority or influence to interfere with an election or affect its results. The fol\u00ad lowing are exemptions from the restric\u00ad tions of the statute : (1) Employees may engage in political activity in connection with any question not specifically identified with any Na\u00ad tional or State political party. They also may engage in political activity in con\u00ad nection with an election if none of the candidates represents a party any of whose candidates for presidential elector received votes at the last preceding elec\u00ad tion at which presidential electors were selected. (2) An exception relates to political campaigns in communities adjacent to the District of Columbia or in communi\u00ad ties the majority of whose voters are employees of the Federal Government. Communities in which the exception ap\u00ad plies are specifically designated by the Civil Service Commission.

(f) There are restrictions other than those imposed by subchapter H I of Chap\u00ad ter 73 of title 5, U.S.C.

Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country aoove loyalty to persons, party, or Government department. 2. Uphold the Constitution, laws, and legal regulations of the United States and of all governments therein and never be a party to their evasion. 3. Give a full day's labor for a full day' s pay; giving to the per* formance of his duties his' earnest effort and best thought. 4. Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of getting tasks accomplished. 5. Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not; and never accept, for himself or his family, favors or benefits under circum\u00ad stance's which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his governmental duties. 6. Hake no private promises of any kind binding upon the duties of office, since a Government employee has no private word which can be binding on public duty. 7. Engage in no business with the Government, either directly Of Indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of his governmental duties. 8. Never use any information coming to him confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a means for making private profit. 9. Expose corruption wherever discovered. 10. Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a public trust. Passed July 11, 1958. (72 STAT.

Bonded fuels, as defined in Subpart B of Part 211 of this Chapter, are exempt from the provisions of Parts 211 and 212 of this chapter. \u00a7 210.34 Petroleum refinery products. (a) Petroleum refinery products such as petroleum wax, petroleum coke,asphalt, road oil, and refinery gases which are not crude oil, refined petro\u00ad leum products, or residual fuel oils are exempt from the provisions of Parts 211 and 212 of this chapter. (b) Definitions. \"Asphalt\" means as\u00ad phalt as defined in ASTM standard D-288. \"ASTM\" means American Society for Testing Materials. \"Petroleum coke\" means a solid resi\u00ad due, the final product of the condensa\u00ad tion process in cracking, consisting mainly of highly polycyclic aromatic hy\u00ad drocarbons very poor in hydrogen, in\u00ad cluding petroleum coke which when cal\u00ad cinated yields almost pure carbon or arti\u00ad ficial graphite suitable for production of carbon or graphite electrodes, structural graphite, motor brushes, dry cells, etc. It includes both forms listed below: (1) Marketable. Those grades of coke produced in delayed or fluid cokers which may be recovered as relatively pure car\u00ad bon. This \"green\" coke may be further purified by calcining or may be sold in the \"green\" state. (2) Catalyst. In many catalytic opera\u00ad tions (i.e., catalytic cracking) carbon is deposited on the catalyst, deactivating the catalyst. The catalyst is reactivated by burning off the carbon, using it as a fuel in the refinery process. This carbon or coke is not recoverable in a concen\u00ad trated form. For statistical purposes, the amount of catalyst coke may be esti\u00ad mated by using an average weight per\u00ad cent (1.5%-8.5%) of charging stock. \"Petroleum wax\" means petroleum wax as defined in ASTM standard D-288. \"Refinery gas\" means a form of gas normally produced in the refining of crude oil which is predominately used for refinery fuel. \"Road oil\" means any heavy petro\u00ad leum oil, including residual asphaltic oils, used as a dust palliative and surface treatment of roads and highways. It is generally produced in six grades from 0, the most liquid, to 5, the most viscous. Subpart D\u2014 General Rules \u00a7 210.61 Retaliatory actions. No firm (including an individual) may take retaliatory action against any other firm (including an individual) that files or manifests an intent to file a com\u00ad plaint of alleged violation of, or that otherwise exercises any rights conferred by the Act, any provision of this part, or any order issued under this Chapter. For the purposes of this paragraph, \"re\u00ad taliatory action\" means any action con\u00ad trary to the purpose or intent of the Eco\u00ad nomic Stabilization Program or the Fed\u00ad eral Energy Administration and may in\u00ad clude a refusal to continue or sell or lease, any reduction in quality, any reduction in quantity of services or products custom\u00ad arily available for sale or lease, any vio\u00ad lation of privacy, any form of harass\u00ad ment, or any inducement of others to retaliate. \u00a7 210.62 Normal business practices. (a) Suppliers will deal with purchasers of an allocated product according to nor\u00ad mal business practices in effect duringthe base period specified in Part 211 for that allocated product, and no supplier may modify any normal business prac\u00ad tice so as to result in the circumvention of any provision of this chapter. \"Sum\u00ad mer fill\" programs and other \"dating\" or seasonal credit programs are among the normal business practices which must be maintained by a supplier under this para\u00ad graph, if that supplier had such pro\u00ad grams in effect during the base period. Credit terms other than those associated with seasonal credit programs are in\u00ad cluded as a part of the May 15,1973 price charged to a class of purchaser under Part 212 of this Chapter. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require suppliers to sell to purchasers who do not arrange proper credit or payments for al\u00ad located products, as customarily associ\u00ad ated with that class of purchaser during the base period (for seasonal credit), or on May 15,1973 (for other credit terms). However, no supplier may require or im\u00ad pose more stringent credit terms or pay\u00ad ment schedules on purchasers than those in effect for that class of purchaser dur\u00ad ing the base period (for seasonal credit), or on May 15, 1973 (for other credit terms). (b) No supplier shall engage in any form of discrimination among purchas\u00ad ers of any allocated product. For purposes of this paragraph, \"discrimination\" means extending any preference or sales treatment which has the effect of frus\u00ad trating or impairing the objectives, pur\u00ad poses and intent of this chapter or of the Act, and includes, but is not limited to, refusal by a retail marketer of motor gas\u00ad oline or diesel fuel to furnish or sell any allocated product due to the absence of a prior selling relationship with the pur\u00ad chaser, or establishment of new volume purchase arrangements where customers of retailers agree in advance to purchase in excess of normal amounts of motor gasoline or diesel fuel and thereby re\u00ad ceive preferential treatment. (c) Any practice which constitutes a means to obtain a price higher than is permitted by the regulations in this chapter or to impose terms or conditions not customarily imposed upon the sale of an allocated product is a violation of these regulations. Such practices in\u00ad clude, but are not limited to devices mak\u00ad ing use of inducements, commissions, kickbacks, retroactive increases, trans\u00ad portation arrangments, premiums, discounts, special privileges, tie-in agreements, tra d e understandings, falsification of records, substitution of inferior commodities or failure to pro\u00ad vide the same services and equipment previously sold. \u00a7 210.63 Sales o f allocated product. Quantities of an allocated product re\u00ad quired by an allocation order to be sold shall be sold at the price for that sub\u00ad stance on the date the order was issued or such other date specified in the order for this purpose.

State set-asides are provided for middle distillates, re\u00ad sidual fuel oil, motor gasoline and pro\u00ad pane. \u00a7 211.2 Relationship o f subparts. Unless otherwise specified in Sub\u00ad parts D through K of this part, the gen\u00ad eral provisions set forth in this subpart apply to the mandatory allocation of all allocated products. \u00a7 211.9 Supplier/purchaser relation\u00ad ships. (a) Supplier/wholesale Each supplier of an allo\u00ad cated product shall supply all wholesale purchaser-resellers and all wholesale purchaser-consumers which purchased or obtained that allocated product from that supplier during the base period as specified in Subparts D through K of this part. (2) (i) Unless otherwise provided in this part or directed by FEA, the sup- plier/wholesale purchaser-reseller re\u00ad lationships defined by specific dates or base periods or otherwise imposed pur\u00ad suant to this part shall be maintain\u00e9d for the duration of the Mandatory Pe\u00ad troleum Allocation Program and may not be waived or otherwise terminated with\u00ad out the express written approval of FEA.(ii) Unless otherwise provided in this part or directed by FEA, the supplier/ wholesale purchaser-consumer relation\u00ad ships defined by specific dates or base periods or otherwise imposed pursuant to this part shall be maintained for the duration of the Mandatory Petroleum Allocation Program and may not be re\u00ad vised or otherwise terminated except that any such relationship may be ter\u00ad minated by the mutual consent of both parties. (b) Supplier/end-user relationship. Each supplier of an allocated product shall, to the maximum extent practi\u00ad cable, supply all end-users which pur\u00ad chased that allocated product from that supplier as of January 15, 1974, and which are entitled to an allocation level under the provisions of Subparts D through K of this part. (c) Changes in ownership or brand. The supplier/purchaser relationships re\u00ad quired by this part shall not be altered by (1) changes in the ownership or right of possession of the real property on which a wholesale purchaser or end-user maintains its on-going business or end use; or (2) changes in the brand or fran\u00ad chise under which a wholesale purchaser- reseller maintains its on-going business. (d) New relationships. (1) Suppliers shall not supply new wholesale purchas\u00ad ers except in accordance with \u00a7 211.12(e). C2) Suppliers shall not supply new end- users except in accordance with 1211.12(f), (3) New suppliers shall not supply wholesale purchasers or end-users ex\u00ad cept in accordance with \u00a7 211.10(e). (e) Dual capacities. A supplier may act in the capacity of a wholesale purchaser and an end-user. A wholesale purchaser- consumer may also be a wholesale purchaser-reseller. A firm which is act\u00ad ing in one or more different capacities shall comply with the appropriate regu\u00ad lations governing each capacity in which it acts. \u00a7 211.10 Supplier' s method o f alloca\u00ad tion. (a) General. (1) Suppliers of allocated products shall allocate all of their allo\u00ad cable supply in accordance with the pro\u00ad visions of this section unless otherwise specified in Subparts D through K of this part. Each supplier shall determine its allocation fraction pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this sec\u00ad tion. Suppliers shall then allocate to wholesale purchasers and end-users in accordance with the provisions of para\u00ad graph (c) of this section. Suppliers of end-users without allocation levels shall allocate their allocable supply in accord\u00ad ance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section. The method of allo\u00ad cation for new suppliers is specified in paragraph (e) of this section. Suppliers with allocation fractions less than one (1.0) must act in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of this sec\u00ad tion, while suppliers with allocation fractions in excess of one (1.0) must act in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section. Suppliers which sell products with different useswhich are subject to allocation under more than one subpart shall determine the applicable subpart by reference to paragraph (h) of this section. (2) For purposes of defining a sup\u00ad plier in this part, a firm shall mean the parent and the consolidated and uncon\u00ad solidated entities (if any) which it directly or indirectly controls. (b) Allocation fraction. Each supplier shall determine an allocation fraction prior to making any allocation. A sup\u00ad plier's allocation fraction for any pe\u00ad riod which corresponds to a base period for an allocated product shall be equal to its allocable supply of that product, which is defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for that period, divided by its supply obligation for all levels of distribution, which is defined in paragraph (b) (2) of this section. Sup\u00ad pliers shall adjust their allocation frac\u00ad tions for each such period to reflect ad\u00ad justments in their supply obligation and in their allocable supply. Each supplier shall only have a singlo allocation frac\u00ad tion for all purchasers except to the ex\u00ad tent permitted in \u00a7 211.14 or unless permitted or required by order of the FEA. Suppliers with two or more dis\u00ad tribution subsystems or regions inde\u00ad pendent of one another may apply to the FEA National Office, in accordance with Subpart G of Part 205 of this chap\u00ad ter, for permission to use multiple allo\u00ad cation fractions whenever use of a single allocation fraction would be impracti\u00ad cable or inconsistent with the objectives of the program. (1) Allocable supply. Each supplier's allocable supply of an allocated product for a period which corresponds to a base period shall be equal to its total supply for that period, which is the sum of its estimated production, including amounts received under processing and exchange agreements, imports, purchases and any reduction in inventory of that allocated product made pursuant to \u00a7 211.22 except as otherwise ordered by FEA; less (i) any amounts designated as a state set-aside for a prime supplier pur\u00ad suant to \u00a7 211.17, (ii) any amounts of allocation requirements supplied directly to end-users or wholesale purchaser-con\u00ad sumers under an allocation level not sub\u00ad ject to an allocation fraction, (iii) any amounts supplied to wholesale pur- chaser-resellers which have certified these amounts to be for ultimate use under an allocation level not subject to an allocation fraction, and (iv) any amounts supplied to customers through exchange agreements. Any existing in\u00ad ventory, or production, importation or purchase of an allocated product used to increase that inventory consistent with the provisions of \u00a7211.22 shall not be included in the allocable supply of that product. (2) Supply obligation \u2014 (i) General. A supplier's supply obligation of a particu\u00ad lar allocated product is the sum of (A) the amounts of its wholesale purchaser- resellers' base period volumes as adjusted pursuant to \u00a7 211.13 for unusual growth, and other allowable factors, which were supplied by the supplier during the ap- FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 propriate base period provided that the wholesale purchaser is still in business; (B) the amounts of base period uses of new wholesale purchasers and end-users which are assigned to or accepted by the supplier in accordance with the provi\u00ad sions of \u00a7211.12; and (C) the amounts of allocation requirements of end-users and wholesale purchaser-consumers sup\u00ad plied by the supplier; minus (D) any amounts of allocation requirements sup\u00ad plied directly to end-users or wholesale purchaser-consumers under an alloca\u00ad tion level not subject to an allocation fraction; and (E) any amounts supplied to wholesale purchaser-resellers which have certified those amounts to be for ultimate use under an allocation level not subject to an allocation fraction. The supply obligation of a retail sales outlet for motor gasoline shall also include an amount equal to its total sales of motor gasoline during the base period to end- users not entitled to an allocation level. A wholesale purchaser's base period vol\u00ad ume, allocation requirements and alloca\u00ad tion levels are defined below. (ii) Base period use. Base period use means base period volume or adjusted b lase period volume, as appropriate. A wholesale purchaser's base period volume of a particular allocated product is the volume of that allocated product pur\u00ad chased or obtained during the appro\u00ad priate base period as determined in accordance with \u00a7 211.12(c), in the case of a new wholesale purchaser, b\u00e1se period volume means the volume assigned pur\u00ad suant to \u00a7 211.12(c). Base period volume, however, does not include any amounts of an allocated product obtained pur\u00ad suant to in kind exchange agreements in\u00ad volving a single product which are normal business operating procedures ex\u00ad cept the difference between the total amounts received under exchange agree\u00ad ments and the total amounts supplied to customers through exchange agreements. Suppliers do not have a base period volume except when acting in the capac\u00ad ity of wholesale purchasers. Depending on the applicable allocation level, end- users may have a base period volume or may be treated on the basis of current requirements. Adjustments to base pe\u00ad riod volumes shall be made in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 211.13. (iii) Allocation requirements. The al\u00ad location requirement of an end-user or wholesale purchaser-consumer is the product of that purchaser's, current re\u00ad quirements or base period use multiplied by the applicable allocation level. (iv) Allocation levels. An allocation level is the percentage of the current re\u00ad quirements or base period use of an end- user or wholesale purchaser-consumer that its supplier shall supply if sufficient volumes of the allocated product are available. Allocation levels are assigned on the basis of the use to be made of the Product and the type of purchaser re\u00ad ceiving the product. (c) Allocation by suppliers to whole\u00ad sale purchasers and end-users. There shall be two levels of priority in the allo\u00ad cation by suppliers to wholesale pur\u00ad chasers and end-users:RULES AND REGULATIONS (1) First priority. The first priority shall be for each supplier at every dis- stribution level (i) to allocate from its total supply to wholesale purchaser- resellers any amounts which those pur\u00ad chasers have certified pursuant to \u00a7 211.12(d) (2) to be for ultimate use under an allocation level not subject to an allocation fraction and (ii) to allocate from its total supply to end-users and wholesale purchaser-consumers supplied directly under an allocation level not sub\u00ad ject to an allocation fraction sufficient volumes of the allocated product to sup\u00ad ply one hundred percent of those pur\u00ad chasers' allocation requirements which suppliers of those purchasers have certi\u00ad fied pursuant to \u00a7 211.12(d) (1). The amounts allocated under this first priority shall not be subject to the sup\u00ad plier's allocation fraction. (2) Second priority. The second prior\u00ad ity for each supplier shall be (i) to allo\u00ad cate to each wholesale purchaser-reseller a volume of allocated product equal to the product of that supplier's allocation fraction multiplied by the amount equal to that wholesale purchaser-reseller's base period use minus any amounts which that purchaser has certified to be for ultimate use under an allocation level not subject to an allocation fraction and (ii) to allocate from its allocable supply to all end-users and wholesale purchaser- consumers supplied directly under an al\u00ad location level subject to an allocation fraction a volume of allocated product equal to the product of that supplier's allocation fraction multiplied by the allo\u00ad cation requirements of those purchasers. (3) Allocation level priority . Alloca\u00ad tion levels listed in Subparts D through K are not arranged in sequence of prior\u00ad ity except that the allocation levels not subject to an allocation fraction must be supplied as the first order of priority. Suppliers shall distribute their allocable supply to all classifications of purchas\u00ad ers listed within each particular percent\u00ad age allocation level and among percent\u00ad age allocation levels other than levels not subject to an allocation fraction without regard to the order of listing. (d) Purchasers without allocation levels. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (g) of this section, suppliers such as retail gasoline dealers, which supply both end-users or whole\u00ad sale purchaser-consumers which are not entitled to an allocation level and end- users or wholesale purchaser-consumers which are entitled to an allocation level shall allocate their allocable supply in the following manner: (1) The first priority for each supplier shall be to allocate, to all end-users and wholesale purchasers which are entitled to an allocation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this sec\u00ad tion. (2) The second priority for each sup\u00ad plier shall be to distribute equitably the remainder of the supplier's allocable supply among all end-users or wholesale purchaser-consumers which are not en\u00ad titled to an allocation level. A state may require or authorize priorities to or among such end-users or wholesale pur-35513 chaser-consumers purchasing the al\u00ad located product for the uses listed in the allocation levels for that product in the subpart of this part applicable to the particular allocated product. Except to the extent that FEA regulations or a State office otherwise may require or au\u00ad thorize, local governments and the sup\u00ad plier may also give priority to or among such end-users or wholesale purchaser- consumers purchasing the allocated product for the uses listed in the alloca\u00ad tion levels for that product in the sub\u00ad part of this part applicable to the particular allocated product. Priority treatment, per se, when granted in ac\u00ad cordance with the provisions of this subparagraph, shall not be considered a form of discrimination among pm- chasers or any other prohibited conduct under \u00a7 210.62 of this chapter. (e) New supplier. (1 )A supplier which was not a base period supplier but was a supplier prior to January 15, 1974 shall supply, in accordance with the provisions of this section, (i) wholesale purchasers which it supplied as of January 15, 1974 and which have no base period supplier; (ii) any assigned purchasers; (iii) new wholesale purchasers acquired after Jan\u00ad uary 15,1974 in accordance with the pro\u00ad visions of \u00a7 211.12; and (iv) to the maxi\u00ad mum extent possible, end-users. (2) A supplier which was not a sup\u00ad plier prior to January 15, 1974 shall be considered to have no supply obligation and shall not allocate supplies to any purchaser without FEA approval. (f) Allocation fractions less than one. . (1) When a supplier's allocation fraction is less than one (1.0), a supplier shall re\u00ad duce, on a pro-rata basis, the amounts supplied to end-users and wholesale pur\u00ad chasers for uses subject to the allocation fraction. End-users and wholesale pur\u00ad chaser-consumers supplied under an allocation level not subject to an alloca\u00ad tion fraction, shall, however, be supplied at a constant one hundred percent of allocation requirements. Wholesale pur\u00ad chaser-resellers which certify amounts of an allocated product to be for ultimate use under an allocation level not subject to an allocation fraction shall also be supplied at one hundred percent of these certified amounts. These purchasers shall not receive a pro-rata reduction unless the supplier's total supply is not sufficient to supply all such end-users and wholesale purchasers at one hun\u00ad dred percent of allocation requirements or certified amounts, as appropriate. (2) Any supplier whose allocation frac\u00ad tion is equal to or less than one (1.0) and whose wholesale purchasers and end-users entitled to receive an alloca\u00ad tion from that supplier either have not purchased or have notified the supplier of their intent not to purchase their complete allocation entitlement by the end of the period correspondiiig to a base period may report and dispose of such volumes in accordance with the provi\u00ad sions of paragraph (g) of this section. (g) Allocation fractions greater than one. (1) General. In allocating allocable supplies of any allocated product among wholesale purchasers and end-users, no supplier may use an allocation fraction FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 35514 RULES AND REGULATIONS greater than one (1.0) except as provided herein. (2) Non-reporting suppliers . Any wholesale purchaser-reseller which is a retail sales outlet or any other supplier not subject to subparagraph (3) below and which has an allocation fraction in excess of one (1.0) for a period corre\u00ad sponding to a base period shall make allocations based on an allocation frac\u00ad tion of one (1.0) and may distribute its surplus product at its discretion. There is no requirement that such a wholesale purchaser-reseller report its surplus product to FEA. (3) Surplus product reports. A supplier of an allocated product which is either a refiner, a prime supplier in any \u00a7tate, or a supplier of a prime supplier (such as a broker) and which is not a retail sales outlet and which has an allocable supply of sufficient magnitude that its alloca\u00ad tion fraction computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section will exceed one (1.0) for a period corresponding to a base period, shall make allocations based on an allocation fraction of one (1.0) and shall report the volume, loca\u00ad tion, price, availability of transportation and significant specifications of surplus product available. The surplus product report shall be submitted in writing to the National FEA office, with a copy to the appropriate regional FEA offices, within five (5) days of the supplier's determination that its allocation frac\u00ad tion will exceed one (1.0). The report must be clearly labeled \" Surplus Product Report\" both on the document and on the outside of the envelope in which the document is transmitted and shall be addressed to: Federal Energy Adminis\u00ad tration, Surplus Product Report, Post Office Box 19407, Washington, D.C. 20036. The FEA shall provide written notification to each supplier submitting a surplus product report of the exact time of receipt of the surplus product report. (4) Hedirection. The National or Re\u00ad gional FEA (whenever authorized by the National FEA) may within ten (10) days after actual receipt of notification made pursuant to subparagraph (3) above di\u00ad rect that the product so reported be distributed among other suppliers, sold to designated wholesale purchasers or end-users, be distributed to the reporting supplier's purchasers on a pro-rata basis, such as using an allocation fraction greater than one (1.0), or be accumu\u00ad lated in inventory. (5) Reporting suppliers. Any supplier which reports pursuant to subparagraph (3) above may distribute its surplus product at its discretion if it is not noti\u00ad fied to the contrary within ten (10) days of receipt of FEA of the supplier's no\u00ad tification under subparagraph (3) above except that (i) the supplier shall supply, in the aggregate, to the category of wholesale purchaser-resellers which are branded independent marketers and, separately, to the category of wholesale purchaser-resellers which are non- branded independent marketers, to the extent that such categories of purchasersare willing to accept it, at least the same proportion of the supplier's surplus product as the total allocation entitle\u00ad ments of such branded or nonbranded independent marketers bear to the total allocation entitlement of all purchas\u00ad ers v/hich are entitled to receive an allo\u00ad cation from that supplier and (ii) retail sales outlets owned anc. operated by the supplier may not purchase or be sup\u00ad plied, in the aggregate, a greater pro\u00ad portion of the supplier's surplus product than the total allocation entitlements of all such retail sales outlets bear to the total allocation entitlements of all pur\u00ad chasers which are entitled to receive an allocation from that supplier unless the supplier first meets all requests for prod\u00ad ucts from independent marketers to the extent required in subparagraph (i) above. (6) Records of disposition of surplus product. Any supplier which reported surplus product for a period correspond\u00ad ing to a base period as required by sub- paragraph (3) above shall maintain ade\u00ad quate records to allow FEA, upon re\u00ad quest, to ascertain the disposition of the surplus product. ' (7) Purchaser's rights. Notwithstand\u00ad ing the provisions of \u00a7 211.12, any whole\u00ad sale purchaser or end-user may purchase allocated product from any supplier which certifies that it has surplus prod\u00ad uct to distribute and that it has com\u00ad plied with the provisions of this para\u00ad graph. (8) Limitation on purchaser's rights. No supplier shall supply and no end-user or wholesale purchaser-consumer shall accept quantities of an allocated product which exceed one hundred (100) percent of the end-user's or wholesale pur\u00ad chaser-consumer's current requirements, except pursuant to subparagraph (9) or as directed by FEA. (9) Special restriction on propane and butane. No supplier shall supply and no end-user or wholesale purchaser-con\u00ad sumer shall accept quantities of propane or butane in excess of one hundred (100) percent of base period use for synthetic natural gas feedstock use, gas utility use, or any industrial use except for the purpose of increasing inven\u00ad tories to the levels allowed under \u00a7 211.86 (g) or \u00a7 211.96(e). (h) Products with different uses. When an allocated product may be subject to allocation under more than one subpart of this part, a wholesale purchaser shall certify the type of use of the product to the supplier which supplied that product during the base period prescribed in the subpart applicable to that type * of use of that product. The supplier shall then supply that wholesale purchaser in ac\u00ad cordance with the provisions of the sub\u00ad part which applies to the certified use of that product unless the supplier and wholesale purchaser mutually agree that the product shall be supplied for a use other than the use during the base period. Suppliers shall supply end-users in accordance with the provisions of the subpart that applies to the end-user's present use of the product.\u00a7211.11 Basis fo r purchaser's entitle, ment to allocation. (a) Basis of entitlement. A wholesale purchaser or an end-user entitled to an allocation level shall receive an alloca\u00ad tion based on its conduct of an on-going business or maintenance of an estab\u00ad lished end use. (b) End-Users and wholesale pur\u00ad chasers as a firm. (1) For purposes of defining an end-user or wholesale pur\u00ad chaser-consumer in this part, a firm shall mean all parts of the parent and the consolidated and unconsolidated en\u00ad tities (if any) which it directly or indi\u00ad rectly controls which act as ultimate consumers including all sites, storage tanks and other facilities or entities of the end-user or wholesale purchaser- consumer that utilize or store an allo\u00ad cated product. (2) Except as provided in Subpart F of this part, for purposes of defining a wholesale purchaser-reseller in this part, a firm shall mean all parts of the parent and the consolidated and unconsolidated entities (if any) which it directly or indirectly controls. (c) Loss of allocation entitlement for going out of business. Wholesale pur\u00ad chasers and end-users which have gone out of business shall not be eligible for allocations based on volumes' received or purchases made prior to going out of business. (d) Transfer of entitlement. The right to receive an allocation shall not be as\u00ad signable separately but shall be consid\u00ad ered an integral part of the on-going business or established end use. The right to an allocation shall be deemed to have been transferred only when the entire business or activity of the firm is transferred to a successor firm. \u00a7 211.12 Purchaser' s allocation entitle\u00ad ment. (a) Scope. This section describes a purchaser's allocation entitlements. Paragraph (b) of this section specifies the volumes of an allocated product which wholesale purchasers and raid- users are entitled to receive from sup\u00ad pliers. The method by which purchasers determine base period volumes is pro\u00ad vided in paragraph (c) of this section and the method by which purchasers determine the amounts not subject to an allocation fraction is provided in para\u00ad graph (d) of this section. P aragrap h s (e ), (f), and (g) of this section set forth procedures by which new wholesale pur\u00ad chasers, new end-users and new im\u00ad porter-consumers, respectively, deter\u00ad mine their entitlement and suppliers. Paragraph (h) of this section provides special relief for purchasers which are denied access to a fuel source by Federal or State order. (b) Entitlements \u2014 (1) Wholesale pur\u00ad chaser-reseller. A wholesale purchaser- reseller shall be entitled to receive a vol\u00ad ume of an allocated product equal to the sum of the volumes allocable to it from each of its suppliers. The volume sup\u00ad plied to a wholesale purchaser-reseller by each of its suppliers shall equal the 4 FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 RULES AND REGULATIONS sum of (1) any amounts which that pur\u00ad chaser has certified to a supplier to be for ultimate use under an allocation level not subject to an allocation fraction plus (ii) the product of that supplier's alloca\u00ad tion fraction multiplied by an amount equal to that part of that wholesale pur\u00ad chaser's base period use purchased or obtained from that supplier minus any amounts which that purchaser has cer\u00ad tified to be for ultimate use under an allocation level not subject to an alloca\u00ad tion fraction. (2) Wholesale purchaser-consumers and end-users. A wholesale purchasers consumer or end-user shall be entitled to receive a volume of an allocated product equal to the sum of the volumes allocable to it from each of its suppliers. The volumes, supplied to a wholesale pur\u00ad chaser-consumer or end-user by each of its suppliers shall equal the sum of (i) that part of the wholesale-purchaser's or end-user's allocation requirements supplied directly by that supplier under an allocation level not subject to an al\u00ad location fraction plus (ii) that part of the wholesale purchaser's or end-user's allocation requirements supplied by that supplier under an allocation level sub\u00ad ject to an allocation fraction. (c) Base period volume determination. (1) By July 1, 1974, each supplier which was not previously subject to this para\u00ad graph prior to May 1, 1974 and which sells an allocated product to a wholesale purchaser or end-user entitled to an al\u00ad location level which is a percentage of a base period use shall report to each of those purchasers with respect to each allocated product, the volume of product which it sold to or transferred to that purchaser in each base period. (2) If, after receipt of a supplier's re\u00ad port, a purchaser questions the accuracy of a supplier's report, it shall notify that supplier and attempt to resolve the dis\u00ad agreement as to base period purchases of the purchaser. (3) If the supplier and purchaser are unable to resolve their differences, the supplier shall commence allocations based on the supplier's records, in ac\u00ad cordance with the allocation provisions in this part, and the purchaser should make application to the appropriate FEA regional office for a corrected base period volume in accordance with FEA forms and instructions. Copies of the purchaser's records for base period pur\u00ad chases should be included with the application (4) if the FEA determines that the purchaser's, application for a corrected base period volume is valid, it may order toe supplier to adjust the purchaser's base period volume and to supply the purchaser with additional volumes of the allocated product equal to the adjusted amount the purchaser should have re- h ^ allocation had initially been based on the corrected base period volume. P e termination of amounts not uoject to an allocation fraction. (1) *toy wholesale purchaser-reseller which supplies end-users or wholesale purchaser-consumers entitled to an al\u00adlocation level which is not subject to an allocation fraction other than a utility shall certify its requirements for such end-users or wholesale purchaser- consumers on an annual basis to its supplier (consistent with any energy conservation program such as the tem\u00ad perature reduction restrictions found in that end-user's allocation level). Any increase above the initial level of alloca\u00ad tion requirements certified shall also be certified to the supplier. In the event that the wholesale purchaser-reseller and its supplier cannot agree on the volume which the wholesale purchaser- reseller is entitled to receive to meet the requirements of the end-user and the wholesale purchaser-consumer custom\u00ad ers of the wholesale purchaser-reseller, an application for validation may be re\u00ad ferred by the wholesale purchaser-re\u00ad seller to FEA. During the period that a request for validation is pending, the supplier shall supply the wholesale pur\u00ad chaser-reseller at the level of require\u00ad ments which is not disputed by the sup\u00ad plier. If the FEA determines that the wholesale purchaser-reseller is entitled to increased requirements in excess of those supplied by the supplier during the period that the request for validation is pending, FEA may order the supplier to supply such increased requirements and to supply the wholesale purchaser-re\u00ad seller with additional volumes of the al\u00ad located product equal to the amount the wholesale purchaser-reseller would have received if the increased requirements had been supplied during such period. (2) All suppliers which receive a certi\u00ad fication of allocation requirements not subject to an allocation fraction pursu\u00ad ant to paragraph (d) (1) of this section or which receive a certification from any other supplier of allocation requirements not subject to an allocation fraction which have been certified to that other supplier shall in turn certify to their sup\u00ad pliers such allocation requirements not subject to an allocation fraction. (3) Suppliers which certify their re\u00ad quirements for wholesale purchaser-con\u00ad sumers and end-users entitled to an allo\u00ad cation level of 100 percent of current requirements not subject to an allocation fraction or which receive a certification from any other supplier of such require\u00ad ments shall be entitled to an adjustment of their base period use as provided by \u00a7 211.13(d)(4). (4) Any end-user or wholesale pur\u00ad chaser-consumer engaged in agricultural production and entitled to an allocation level of 100 percent of current require\u00ad ments not subject to an allocation frac\u00ad tion which disputes the certification of such requirements by its supplier, or any supplier which disputes the entitlement claimed by any wholesale purchaser- consumer or end-user engaged in agri\u00ad cultural production may apply to the Agricultural Stabilization and Conserva\u00ad tion Service Office for assistance in medi\u00ad ating the dispute. Whenever a whole\u00ad sale purchaser-consumer or end-user entitled to an allocation level not sub\u00ad ject to an allocation fraction contends that it is not being supplied with 10035515] percent of its current requirements, such wholesale purchaser-consumer or end- user may apply to the regional FEA fer validation of the amounts of its current requirements. (5) Within five (5) days of the end of each period which corresponds to a base period, wholesale purchaser-resellers certifying pursuant to this paragraph shall certify to their suppliers the quan\u00ad tity of product delivered by the whole\u00ad sale purchaser-reseller to end-users and wholesale purchaser-consumers for uses under an allocation level not subject to an allocation fraction during the period and shall certify that none of the quan\u00ad tity of product delivered to the whole\u00ad sale purchaser-reseller by. the supplier for delivery to end-users and wholesale purchaser-consumers for uses under an allocation level not subject to an alloca\u00ad tion fraction was diverted to other uses during the period. Any quantities of product delivered> for a period which corresponds to a base period to a whole\u00ad sale purchaser-reseller for delivery to end-users and wholesale purchaser-con\u00ad sumers for uses under an allocation level not subject to an allocation fraction which is not delivered by the wholesale purchaser-reseller to such users during the period shall be used to adjust the quantity of product to be received by the wholesale purchaser-reseller for such uses in a subsequent period which corre\u00ad sponds to a base period. Suppliers shali in turn make adjustments to reflect ad\u00ad justments made by suppliers of a whole\u00ad sale purchaser-reseller under this sub- paragraph. (e) New wholesale purchasers. Whole\u00ad sale purchasers which do not have base period suppliers and wholesale purchas\u00ad ers whose base period suppliers are un\u00ad able to supply them with sufficient amounts of an allocated product shall be supplied as provided in this para\u00ad graph; - (1) Mutual arrangements for whole\u00ad sale purchaser-consumers. Wholesale purchaser-consumers without a base period supplier or a new supplier as pro\u00ad vided in \u00a7 211.10(e) (1) are encouraged to make mutually acceptable arrange\u00ad ments with suppliers. Suppliers are en\u00ad couraged to continue any existing sup\u00ad plier/purchaser relationships with such wholesale purchaser-consumers and to accept wholesale purchaser-consumers as new purchasers. (i) Wholesale purchaser-consumers without a base period supplier or a new supplier as provided in \u00a7 211.10(e) (1) and existing or prospective suppliers may agree upon a proposed base period vol\u00ad ume for the wholesale purchaser- consumer. (ii) The supplier shall within 10 days of making the mutual arrangement no\u00ad tify FEA by certified mail in accordance with FEA forms and instructions of the proposed base period volume and the basis upon which the proposed base peri\u00ad od volume was determined. In no event may the supplier commence delivery of any quantity of an allocated product pursuant to the proposed base period volume prior to the required notification FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 35516 to the FEA. The proposed base period volume is subject to adjustment by FEA. FEA may also assign the wholesale purchaser-consumer to another supplier. (iii) After FEA has been notified by the supplier and during the period that FEA has the proposed supplier/pur- chaser relationship (including the pro\u00ad posed base period volume) under con\u00ad sideration, the supplier may provide the wholesale purchaser-consumer with in\u00ad terim supplies in accordance with the proposed base period volume. (2) New wholesale purchaser-resellers. (i) Suppliers which have accepted as new purchasers wholesale purchaser- resellers prior to June 1, 1974, shall no\u00ad tify the FEA by August 1, 1974 of the names of all such new purchasers, the proposed base period volume for each purchaser and the basis upon which the proposed base period volume was deter\u00ad mined. The proposed base period volume is subject to adjustment by FEA. FEA may also assign the wholesale purchaser- reseller to another supplier. Suppliers may provide interim supplies to such wholesale purchaser-resellers pending FEA assignment of a supplier and a base period volume. (ii) Wholesale purchaser-resellers without a base period supplier or a new supplier as provided in \u00a7 211.10(e) (1) must apply to FEA for assignment to a supplier and for assignment of a base period volume in accordance with Sub\u00ad part C of Part 205 of this chapter. (iii) Firms which intend to operate new retail sales outlets should advise FEA as soon as practicable (preferably before construction begins) of their in\u00ad tention and the anticipated base period volume requirements for such new re\u00ad tail sales outlets. (iv) Suppliers shall not make interim deliveries to wholesale purchaser-re\u00ad sellers or retail sales outlets covered by paragraphs (e) (2) (ii) and (e) (2) (iii) of this section until FEA has as\u00ad signed a supplier and a base period vol\u00ad ume to the wholesale purchaser-reseller or the retail sales outlet. (3) Assignments. Any wholesale pur\u00ad chaser which does not have a base period supplier or a new supplier as provided in \u00a7 211.10(e) (1) (including all whole\u00ad sale purchaser-consumers which cannot locate a supplier under paragraph (e) (1) of this section) or whose base period supplier(s) or new supplier as provided in \u00a7 211.10(e) (1) is unable to supply it with sufficient amounts of allocated product may apply to FEA as provided in Subpart C of Part 205 of this chapter to be assigned a supplier and a base period volume on a temporary or per\u00ad manent basis. (4) Any assigned base period volume under the provisions of this paragraph will be deemed to have been adjusted for growth under \u00a7 211.13(b) through the date of the assignment and may be adjusted thereafter under the provisions of \u00a7211.13 (c) or (d). Base period vol\u00ad umes will not be assigned on any basis which gives a wholesale purchaser which is a new purchaser an unfair advantage over wholesale purchasers which haveRULES AND REGULATIONS base period suppliers or new suppliers as provided in \u00a7 211.10(e). (5) Any purchaser which is assigned to or accepted by a supplier under the provisions of this paragraph shall be accepted by the supplier for the dura\u00ad tion of the program or until otherwise directed by the FEA. (f) New end-users. (1) Suppliers to the maximum extent possible shall ac\u00ad cept new end-users where such pur\u00ad chaser, under normal business practices, could logically have been served by the supplier in accordance with its base pe\u00ad riod business practices. Suppliers shall allocate to new end-users in a manner consistent with the allocation methods set forth in this chapter. (2) If the supplier and new end-user cannot agree on an allocation require\u00ad ment for the end-user or if the end- user cannot locate a supplier, the end- user may apply to 4he appropriate State Office in accordance with the procedures specified in Subpart Q of Part 205 of this chapter. In this event, the new end-user shall certify to the State Office docu\u00ad mented evidence justifying the proposed allocation requirement as normal and reasonable for the intended use. (g) End-user and wholesale pur- chaser-consumer importers. End-users and wholesale purchaser-consumers which import an allocated product in ex\u00ad cess of the volumes which they imported in the base period, and end-users and wholesale purchaser-consumers which have not previously imported an allo\u00ad cated product may import that prod\u00ad uct for their own use subject to \u00a7 211.10(g) (8). Such imports will not otherwise affect their allocation en\u00ad titlement except to the extent that FEA determines that such imports, without a reduction in domestic alloca\u00ad tion entitlements, are inconsistent with the objectives of the Act. Should the cir\u00ad cumstances warrant, FEA may require that such imports be allocated to other end-users or suppliers. End-user and wholesale purchaser-consumer import\u00ad ers are required to report to both national and regional FEA as provided in \u00a7 211.225. (h) Curtailment of certain energy sources by Federal or State, rule or order. any end-user or wholesale purchaser- consumer which has been denied access to a source of energy other than an al\u00ad located product as a consequent of cur\u00ad tailment by, or pursuant to, a plan filed in compliance with a rule or order of a Federal or State agency, or where the end-user's or wholesale purchaser-con\u00ad sumer's supply of such fuel is unobtain\u00ad able by reason of an abandonment of service permitted or ordered by a Fed\u00ad eral or State agency may apply to the FEA, under the provisions of this section, as a new purchaser for an allocated product, provided, however, that a whole\u00ad sale purchaser which is an interruptible customer for a source of energy other than an allocated product shall continue its base period supplier/purchaser rela\u00ad tionships for an allocated product. Such application shall be in accordance with Subpart C of Part 205 of this chapter.\u00a7211.13 Adjustments to base period volume. (a) Scope. (1) The adjustment pro\u00ad cedures under this section are applicable to the allocation of propane, butane, motor gasoline, middle distillate, avia\u00ad tion fuels (except allocations to civil air carriers), and residual fuel oil (except allocations to utilities) and other prod\u00ad ucts subject to Subpart K of this part. This section describes the means by which wholesale purchasers and end- users may receive adjustments to their base period volumes. All adjustments made pursuant to this section are subject to verification by FEA audit. (2) Paragraph (b) of this section pro\u00ad vides for supplier-initiated and whole\u00ad sale purchaser-initiated adjustments of a wholesale purchaser's base period vol\u00ad umes for each month of the appropriate base period year for unusual growth based upon actual sales volumes in 1 972 and 1973. Paragraph (c) of this section provides for an adjustment of wholesale purchasers' and certain end-users' base period uses to account for changed cir\u00ad cumstances. Paragraph (d) of this sec\u00ad tion provides an adjustment to base period uses when increased requirements are certified by end-users and wholesale purchaser-consumers entitled to receive an allocation level of 100 percent of cur\u00ad rent requirements subject to an alloca\u00ad tion fraction. (3) Paragraph (e) of this section requires non-discrimination between wholesale purchasers in granting adjust\u00ad ments. Paragraph (f) of this section re\u00ad quires purchasers to certify applications for adjustments. (b) Adjustments for unusual growth\u2014 (1) Supplier-initiated wholesale pur\u00ad chaser unusual growth adjustment. Wholesale purchasers which purchased an allocated product (other than residual fuel oil which is assigned 1973 base periods) shall receive a supplier-initiated adjustment to their base period volumes by their suppliers to compensate for un\u00ad usual growth between the 1972 base periods and the corresponding months in 1973. (i) For purposes of this paragraph, that part of any growth which exceeds 10 percent for the periods compared for motor gasoline or 5 percent for the periods compared for any other allocated product is defined as \"unusual growth.\" Wholesale purchasers will be granted an adjustment only for that part of growth which was in excess of 10 percent for motor gasoline and 5 percent for other allocated products. (ii) A supplier shall adjust the base period volume for unusual growth in each month of the base period year for each wholesale purchaser which pur\u00ad chased the allocated product from the supplier in 1972. There is no require\u00ad ment that a wholesale purchaser apply to the supplier for this adjustment. A supplier shall make the adjustment without a request by the wholesale pur- chaser to the extent that the supplier's records indicate that any wholesale pur\u00ad chaser is eligible for the adjustment. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 RULES AND REGULATIONS 35517 (iii) The adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph shall be based upon a comparison of the volume of the allo\u00ad cated product purchased from the sup\u00ad plier In 1972 and the volume purchased In 1973. If the supplier did not supply the wholesale purchaser for all of 1972 the adjustment shall be made by a com\u00ad parison of the volume for the period in 1 9 7 2 that the supplier did supply the wholesale purchaser and the volume purchased by the wholesale purchaser during the corresponding period of 19.73. A wholesale purchaser's 1973 volume in excess of its 1972 volume shall be ex\u00ad pressed as a percentage of the 1972 vol\u00ad ume to determine growth rate. Unusual growth shall then be determined by sub\u00ad tracting from the growth rate the appro\u00ad priate percentage figure set forth in sub- paragraph (i) above. The resulting per\u00ad centage shall be multiplied by the whole\u00ad sale purchase's base period volume for each base period for which the supplier is obligated to supply the wholesale pur\u00ad chaser to provide the amount by which each base period volume shall be in\u00ad creased for unusual growth. Example : Firm A, a wholesale purchaser, purchased 100,000 gallons of motor gasoline from Firm B in 1972 and 150,000 gallons in 1973. Firm A's 1973 growth rate is 50 percent (1973 volume minus 1972 volufne divided by 1972 volume). Firm A's unusual growth is 40 percent (that growth in excess of first 10 per\u00ad cent). Firm B therefore will increase by 40 percent each of Firm A's base period volumes (the volumes sold in each month of 1972) to be supplied by Firm B. (iv) Unusual growth adjustments un\u00ad der this paragraph shall be certified by the supplier in accordance with FEA forms and instructions and filed with PEA by August 1, 1974. (v) The adjustments under this para\u00ad graph shall be made by the supplier, and the certified form required by paragraph (b)(1) (iv) of this section, shall be filed with FEA. on or before July 1, 1974. There is no requirement that FEA vali\u00ad date any adjustment made under this paragraph. Suppliers shall commence de\u00ad liveries on the basis of adjustments to base period volumes which reflect un\u00ad usual growth no later than July 1, 1974. A supplier may commence deliveries of an allocated product reflecting adjust\u00ad ments to base period volumes for unusual growth prior to July 1, 1974, provided that adjustments for all of its eligible wholesale purchasers of that allocated product have been made and such de\u00ad liveries are commenced at the same time for all such wholesale purchasers. (vi) Suppliers shall notify all whole\u00ad sale purchasers for each base period of the base period year for any adjustment lor unusual growth made under this sub- paragraph. The notice shall be given on or before August 1,1974. (vii) Each supplier shall notify all of its wholesale purchasers which do not receive an adjustment under this sub- paragraph. The notice shall be given on or before the date the required certified *2 2 W A1 \u00ab** with FEA. The notice shall acmse each such wholesale purchaser \" ay apply to the supplier for an adjustment to base period volume(s) forunusual growth under paragraph (b>(3) of this section. (viii) No wholesale purchaser which has received an adjustment for unusual growth in 1973 shall receive an additional adjustment under this paragraph except to the extent that such initial adjust\u00ad ment did not fully compensate the whole\u00ad sale purchaser for unusual growth as al\u00ad lowed by this subparagraph. A supplier shall not decrease the base period volume (or adjusted base period volume) of a wholesale purchaser under this subpara\u00ad graph if that purchaser's 1973 volume is less than that purchaser's 1972 volume. (ix) No wholesale purchaser shall ac\u00ad cept an adjusted base period volume initiated by a supplier under this para\u00ad graph which, when combined with the adjusted base period volumes supplied to the wholesale purchaser by its other base period suppliers^ would exceed the wholesale purchaser's actual unusual growth for a base period. A wholesale purchaser offered such an adjusted base period volume shall immediately notify FEA in accordance with forms and in\u00ad structions issued by FEA. The FEA may require suppliers of the wholesale pur\u00ad chaser to adjust the wholesale purchas\u00ad er's base period volume as adjusted by its suppliers under this paragraph and to adjust the wholesale purchaser's future v allocations to compensate for any excess product received by the wholesale purchaser. (x) Although wholesale purchasers of propane have a base period that includes part of 1973, for the purpose of this paragraph, suppliers shall determine such wholesale purchasers' unusual growth by comparing the volume of pro\u00ad pane purchased from the supplier in 1972 and the volume purchased in 1973, If the supplier did not supply the wholesale purchaser for all of 1972, the adjustment shall be made by a comparison of the volume for the period in 1972 that the supplier did supply the wholesale pur\u00ad chaser and the volume purchased by the wholesale purchaser during the corre\u00ad sponding period of 1973. (2) Additional unusual growth adjust\u00ad ment for wholesale purchaser-resellers. This subparagraph provides an addi\u00ad tional adjustment for wholesale pur\u00ad chaser-resellers following an adjustment of their base period volume under para\u00ad graph (b )(1) above. If the base period \\jolume of a wholesale purchaser-reseller as adjusted for unusual growth pursuant to paragraph (b) (1) of this section minus the 1973 allocation requirements of its purchasers for use under an al\u00ad location level which is not now subject to an allocation fraction is less than the wholesale purchaser-reseller's adjusted base period volume minus such alloca\u00ad tion requirements as calculated under this paragraph, the wholesale pur\u00ad chaser-reseller may apply to its supplier for an adjustment to be calculated as follows: (i) The wholesale purchaser-reseller will determine its 1972 volume less those volumes delivered to purchasers for use under an allocation level which is not now subject to an allocation fraction. Awholesale purchaser-reseller may calcu\u00ad late such volume by subtracting from its 1972 volume either: (A ) those actual volumes delivered in 1972 to purchasers for use under an al\u00ad location level which is not now subject to an allocation fraction and certified as accurate by the wholesale purchaser-re- seller, or (B) that volume which as a percent\u00ad age of its 1972 volume corresponds to the percentage of the total volume delivered in 1973 to purchasers for use under an allocation level which is not now subject to an allocation fraction. (ii) The wholesale purchaser-reseller will determine its 1973 volume less those volumes delivered in 1973 to purchasers for use under an allocation level which is not now subject to an allocation fraction. (iii) The wholesale purchaser-reseller may then calculate its unusual growth adjustment using its 1972 and 1973 volumes less the volume in both years delivered to purchasers for use under an allocation level which is not now subject to an allocation fraction as otherwise provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. (iv) If the aggregate adjusted base period volumes calculated under this subparagraph are greater than the ag\u00ad gregate adjusted base period volumes calculated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section minus the 1973 allocation requirements of the wholesale pur\u00ad chaser-reseller's purchasers which are not subject to an allocation fraction, then the wholesale purchaser-reseller's aggregate adjusted base period volumes may be further adjusted to reflect the difference between those two amounts. Example : Firm A, a wholesale purchaser, purchased 100,000 gaUons of motor gasoline from Firm B in 1972 and 150,000 gallons in 1973. Firm B under paragraph (b ) (1) notified Firm A that the base period volumes sup\u00ad plied by Firm B to Firm A would be in\u00ad creased by 40 percent. See example following b (l)(i ii ). Since the aggregate of Firm A 's base period volumes is 100,000 gallons, the aggregate of Firm A 's base period volumes (as adjusted under paragraph (b )(1 )) will be 140,000 gallons (100,000+40 percent of 100,000). The 1973 requirements of Firm A's pur\u00ad chasers for use under an allocation level not now subject to an allocation fraction was 90,000 gallons. Firm A does not 'know the actual sales to such purchasers for such uses In 1972. To determine whether Firm A is en\u00ad titled to an adjustment under \u00a7 211.13(b) (2). Firm A makes the following calcula\u00ad tions: (1) Under \u00a7 211.13(b) (2) (i) (B ) Firm A assumes that 60 percent of its 1972 sales were to purchasers for use under an allocation level not now subject to an allocation frac\u00ad tion because 60 percent of its 1973 sales were in this category (90,000 divided by 150,000). Firm A then determines that it sold 40,000 gallons to purchasers for use under an alloca\u00ad tion level not now subject to the allocation fraction in 1972 by multiplying 60 percent times 100,000 and subtracting that product (60,000) from 100,000. (2) Firm A's 1973 volume less those volumes delivered to purchasers for use under an allocation level not now subject to an allocation fraction is 60,000 (150,000 \u201490,000), (3) Firm A next calculates its unusual growth adjustment using its 1972 and 1973 FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 35518 volumes less the volume in both years de\u00ad livered to purchasers for use under an alio- , cation level not now subject to an alloca\u00ad tion fraction. Firm A's 1973 growth rate using this method of calculation is 50 per\u00ad cent (60,000\u201440,000 divided by 40,000). Firm A's unusual growth rate is 40 percent (that growth in excess of 10 percent). If Firm A increases its 1972 volume less the volume delivered to purchasers for use under an allocation level but not now subject to an allocation fraction, by 40 percent, the volume will be 56,000 (40,000 plus 40 percent of 40,000). (4) Firm A then calculates its aggregate base period volumes adjusted for unusual growth pursuant to \u00a7 211.13(b) (1) which is 140,000 gallons. That volume minus the 1973 volume sold to purchasers for use under an allocation level not subject to an allocation fraction equals 50,000 gallons (140,000 \u201490,000). (5) Since the aggregate adjust\u00e9d base period volumes calculated under paragraph (3) of this example are greater than the ag\u00ad gregate adjusted base period volumes as cal\u00ad culated under paragraph (4) of this example, Firm A may apply to Firm B for an additional adjustment to its aggregate base period vol\u00ad umes of 6,000 gallons (56,000 minus 50,000). Firm A's newly aggregated adjusted base period volumes will then equal 146,000 gal\u00ad lons (140,000+6,000). If Firm B supplied Firm A in each month of 1972, Firm B will increase each base period volume as adjusted under b (l) by 500 gallons (6,000 divided by 12). (3) Wholesale purchaser initiated un\u00ad usual growth application, (i) Any whole\u00ad sale purchaser which does not receive an adjustment under paragraph (b) (1) of this section or which disputes the adjust\u00ad ment made thereunder by one of its sup\u00ad pliers may apply to that supplier for an adjustment of its base period volume to compensate for unusual growth in 1973 in accordance with Subpart B of Part 205 of this chapter. (ii) Any adjustment made under this subparagraph shall be based solely on actual volumes supplied or purchased in 1972 and 1973 as indicated by the rec\u00ad ords of the supplier and the wholesale purchaser. Unusuai growth has the same meaning under this subparagraph as under paragraph (b) (1) of this section. Adjustments to base period volumes for unusual growth under this subparagraph shall be calculated in the same manner as such adjustments under paragraph (b) (1) 'of this section. (iii) Base' period suppliers of whole\u00ad sale purchasers shall include in an ad\u00ad justment for unusual growth their pro\u00ad portionate share of that part of a whole\u00ad sale purchaser's 1973 volume which was not supplied to that wholesale purchaser by a base period supplier of the whole\u00ad sale purchaser. Wholesale purchasers shall certify to their base period sup\u00ad pliers the 1973 volumes purchased by the wholesale purchaser from suppliers which were not base period suppliers of the wholesale purchaser. A base period supplier's share of such 1973 volumes shall be equal to that supplier's propor\u00ad tionate share of the 1972 volumes sup\u00ad plied to the wholesale purchaser by all suppliers which supplied that purchaser during the base period. (iv) Upon receipt of an application for unusual growth under this subpara\u00ad graph, th\u00e9 supplier shall adjust theRULES AND REGULATIONS wholesale purchaser's base period vol\u00ad ume within ten (10) days. If the supplier disagrees with the application, it may re\u00ad quest ' validation from the appropriate regional FEA; Provided , however , That the supplier shall immediately make an interim adjustment to the applicant's base period volume commencing with the first period which corresponds to,a base period and which commences later than twenty (20) days after receipt of th\u00e8 ap\u00ad plication in the proposed adjusted amount during the pendency of any FEA validation proceeding. If the FEA vali\u00ad dation proceeding results in an adjusted amount less than that supplied during the pendency of such proceeding. FEA may require the supplier to adjust the wholesale purchaser's future allocations to compensate for any excess product supplied during the interim period. (v) No wholesale purchaser which has received. an adjustment for unusual growth in 1973 shall receive an addi\u00ad tional adjustment under this subpara\u00ad graph except to the extent that such initial adjustment did not fully compen\u00ad sate the wholesale purchaser for unusual growth as allowed by this subparagraph. (c) Adjustments for changed cir\u00ad cumstances\u2014 (1) Wholesale purchasers. Wholesale purchasers may apply to the FEA pursuant to Subpart B of Part 205 jof this chapter for adjustments to their base period use for changed circum\u00ad stances since January 1, 1973, which have not been reflected in an adjustment under paragraph (b) of this sec\u00ad tion. In processing such applications, the FEA may consider situations that indicate a need for increased amounts over base period use including but not limited to plant expansions, changed traffic patterns, closed retail sales outlets which have caused increased demand upon remaining retail sales out\u00ad lets, changes in the local economy, un\u00ad usual seasonal fluctuations, new popula\u00ad tion, industrial growth, acceptance of new end-users or unusual growth prob\u00ad lems such as could occur at truck stops on new highways. A wholesale purchaser- reseller which operated in a marketing area that experienced unusual growth or other changed circumstances during 1973 . but which was unable to increase its sales to meet the increased demand because its supplier imposed an allocation frac\u00ad tion under the Voluntary Petroleum Al\u00ad location Program may apply for an ad\u00ad justment under this paragraph. , (2) End-users. End-users whose allo\u00ad cation level is a percentage of base period use may apply to the appropriate State Office to receive an adjustment to their base period volume for changed circum\u00ad stances after January 1,~1974. The State Office shall process the application for adjustment and make recommnedations to the FEA in accordance with the pro\u00ad cedures specified in Subpart Q of Part 205 of this chapter. (3) Wholesale purchasers and end- users shall submit their applications for adjustments to their base period use under this paragraph to their suppliers prior to submission to FEA or the appro\u00ad priate State office. The supplier shall cer\u00ad tify information with respect to the ap*plication in accordance with forms and instructions issued by FEA and submit the application together with its certifi\u00ad cation to FEA or the appropriate State office not later than ten (10) days follow\u00ad ing receipt of the application from the wholesale purchaser or end-user. (4) FEA action. FEA shall only make adjustments for changed circumstances when there are compelling situations re\u00ad quiring relief. Such adjustments shall be based upon applications which are fully supported by detailed facts, figures and other relevant documentation. (d) Adjustments for increased current requirements. (1) Any end-user or whole\u00ad sale purchaser-consumer entitled to an allocation level of 100 percent of current requirements which is subject to an al\u00ad location fraction shall certify to its sup- plier any increased requirements (con\u00ad sistent with any energy conservation program such as the temperature reduc\u00ad tion restrictions found in that end-user's allocation level) above the level of re\u00ad quirements on January 1, 1974. In. the event that the end-user or wholesale pur- chaser-consumer and supplier cannot agree on a volume to be supplied, an ap\u00ad plication for validation may be referred by the end-user or wholesale purchaser- consumer to the office specified in \u00a7 205.13 of this chapter. The request for validation shall be made in accordance j with forms and instructions issued by FEA and may be made not sooner than ten (10) days after the certification has been presented to the supplier. During the period that a request for validation is pending, the supplier shall supply the wholesale purchaser-consumer or end- user at the level of requirements Which is not disputed by the supplier. If the FEA determines that the purchaser is entitled to increased requirements in excess of those supplied b 3r the supplier during the period that the request for validation is pending, FEA may order the supplier to supply such increased requirements and to supply the purchaser with additional volumes of the allocated product equal to the amount the purchaser would have received if the increased requirements had been supplied during such period. The FEA may subsequently require the supplier to adjust such end-user's or wholesale purchaser-consumer's alloca\u00ad tion requirements to compensate for any excess product supplied during the vali\u00ad dation period. (2) All suppliers which, in their capac\u00ad ity as wholesale purchaser-resellers, re\u00ad ceive a certification of increased require\u00ad ments pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section or which receive a certifica\u00ad tion from any other supplier of increased requirements which have been certified to that other supplier, shall in turn cer\u00ad tify to their suppliers these increased re\u00ad quirements and be assigned a proportion-? ate adjustment to that part of their base period volume received from each sup\u00ad plier to cover the certified increases in volume granted under this paragraph. (3) End-users and wholesale pur\u00ad chaser-consumers which claim increases under this paragraph must be prepared to establish their historic requirements and justify their increased requirements. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 RULES AND REGULATIONS 35519 (4) All suppliers which, in their capac\u00ad ity as wholesale purchaser-resellers, cer\u00ad tify their requirements for wholesale purchaser-consumers and end-users en\u00ad titled to an allocation level of 100 per\u00ad cent of current requirements not subject to an allocation fraction pursuant to \u00a7 211.12(d) or which receive a certifica\u00ad tion from any other supplier of such re\u00ad quirements, shall in turn certify to their suppliers such increased requirements and be assigned a proportionate adjust\u00ad ment to that part of their base period use received from each supplier. .(e) Non-discrimination among whole\u00ad sale purchasers. In granting adjustments to base period use under this section, the supplier shall not discriminate among branded independent marketers, non- branded independent marketers and wholesale purchaser-resellers operated by the supplier. (f) Certifications and downward ad\u00ad justments of base period uses. The chief executive officer (or his authorized agent) of a purchaser applying to a sup\u00ad plier for an adjustment under this sec\u00ad tion shall certify such application for accuracy. Such applications shall con\u00ad tain a statement that increased alloca\u00ad tions shall be used only for the purpose stated in the application, shall not be diverted for other uses; and that if its needs decline, the purchaser shall file an amended application for a downward ad\u00ad justment to its base period use. \u00a7 211.14 Redirection o f products.' ~ (a) To meet imbalances that may oc\u00ad cur in the supplies of any allocated prod\u00ad uct, the regional or National FEA may order the transfer of specified amounts of any such product from one area to another or may order that different allo\u00ad cation fractions be used in different areas. An area, as used in this section, means a State, a group of States within a region, or any geographical part of a State or States within a region. The Na\u00ad tional FEA may also order the transfer of specified amounts of any allocated product from one region to another re\u00ad gion or may order that different alloca\u00ad tion fractions be used in different regions to meet such imbalances. Further, the PEA may transfer supplies of allocated products among suppliers in order to remedy supply imbalances. The regional or National FEA will not order the trans\u00ad fer of an allocated product under this section from one area within a State to another within the State without the receipt of a recommendation by the State Office. (b) Refiners and importers are author\u00ad ised to reduce the monthly allocable supply to purchasers of those allocated products covered under Subparts D, E, F, p, H (except Civil Air Carriers) and I (except utilities) for any region or area U ? ^ve *5) percent and to increase the total quantity of any of these allo\u00ad cated products available in another re- or.area experiencing shortages sig\u00ad nificantly greater than are being experi\u00ad enced elsewhere in the nation to meet eponal imbalances due to weather vari- ion, seasonal demand, or other cir- umstances beyond their controL Suchaction may be accomplished without prior approval from the Administrator, FEA, but must be reported immediately after the adjustment occurs to the Na\u00ad tional FEA, the appropriate regional FEA, and the State Office of any State within a region or area directly affected by the reduction or increase. Redistribu\u00ad tion involving reduction of product vol\u00ad umes greater than five (5) percent from any State shall require approval from the Administrator, FEA, prior to any ac\u00ad tion by any refiner or importer. The ad\u00ad justment provided for in this section shall not be cumulative. Allocation frac\u00ad tions for a region or area which are re\u00ad duced by such a reduction of an allocated product shall be returned to prereduc\u00ad tion levels as soon as practicable. (c) Shifts made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall be employed solely to effect a better regional distri\u00ad bution of allocated products and shall not discriminate against branded or non- branded independent marketers, inde\u00ad pendent refiners, or small refiners. (d) Any refiner, importer, or other s\u00f9pplier which has significantly reduced or which intends to reduce marketing or distribution activities in any region or area and which is required by FEA regu\u00ad lations to supply its base period and as\u00ad signed wholesale purchasers in that re\u00ad gion or area may apply to the National FEA to seek a change in the method of supplying such wholesale purchasers. The FEA may order the reassignment of wholesale purchasers or end-users from one supplier to another. Pending action by the National F\u00cbA bn such application, such refiners, importers and suppliers are under a continuing obligation to pro\u00ad vide allocations to all their base period and assigned wholesale purchasers in any region or area either directly or through a substitute supplier in accord\u00ad ance with \u00a7 211.25. \u00a7 211.15 State offices o f petroleum allo\u00ad cation. (a) Any state may apply to the Na\u00ad tional Office of the FEA, to create a State Office of Petroleum Allocation within the State. (b) Upon certification by the FEA such State Ofljce of Petroleum Alloca\u00ad tion will be delegated authority to ad\u00ad minister the state set-aside program, to provide assistance in obtaining adjust\u00ad ments specified in \u00a7 211.13 and such other authorities specified in this part, or in orders issued by the FEA. \u00a7 211.17 Slate set-aside. (a) Scope and purpose. A state set- aside system shall be established for propane, middle distillate, motor gaso\u00ad line and residual fuel oil (except as used by utilities or as bunker fuel for maritime shipping). Authority may be delegated to a State office to administer the state set- aside for that State. The state set-aside' shall be utilized by a State office to meet hardship and emergency requirements of all wholesale purchaser-consumers and end-users within that state from the state set-aside volumes, including whole\u00ad sale purchaser-consumers and end-users which are part of any governmentalorganization. To facilitate relief of the hardship and emergency requirements of wholesale purchaser-consumers and end-users, the State office may direct that a wholesale purchaser-reseller be supplied from the state set-aside in order that the wholesale purchaser-reseller can supply the wholesale purchaser-con\u00ad sumers and end-users experiencing the hardship or emergency. (b) State set-aside volume. (1) A prime supplier shall inform each appro\u00ad priate State office and each appropriate regional FEA office monthly in accord\u00ad ance with \u00a7 211.222(b) by each product subject to State set-aside, of the esti\u00ad mated volume of each product to be sold into that State for consumption within that State. (2) The FEA shall determine the state set-aside percentage level for each prod\u00ad uct. The initial percentage levels for the state set-aside system are specified in appropriate subparts of this part. The FEA will publish any changes in these percentages. (3) The set-aside volume available to a State office for a particular month shall be the sum of the amounts calculated by multiplying the state set-aside percent\u00ad age level by each prime supplier's esti\u00ad mated portion of its total supply for that month which will be sold into that State's distribution system for consumption within the State. (4) The state set-aside for a particu\u00ad lar month cannot be accumulated or de\u00ad ferred; it shall be made available from stocks of prime suppliers whether di\u00ad rectly or through their wholesale pur\u00ad chaser-resellers. (c) State representative. Each sup\u00ad plier shall designate a representative within each State in which the supplier is a prime supplier to act for and in be\u00ad half of the prime supplier with respect to state set-aside petitions and assign\u00ad ments from the state set-aside to be supplied by that prime supplier. Each prime supplier for a State shall desig\u00ad nate its representative for that State and shall notify in writing the appropriate State office of such designation by June 15, 1974. The designated representative for a State shall be a firm which main\u00ad tains a place of business within the State. The State office shall to the maximum ex\u00ad tent possible consult with a prime sup\u00ad plier's representative prior to issuing any authorizing document affecting state set-aside volumes to be provided by the prime supplier. (d) State action. (1) All hardship and emergency applications for assignment from the State set-aside system and ap\u00ad peals thereof shall be filed with and re\u00ad solved by the appropriate State Office in accordance with Subpart Q of Part 205 of this chapter. Applicants shall identi\u00ad fy their existing supplier, or if they do not have a supplier, at least two sup\u00ad pliers which the applicant has contacted and which could provide the allocated product. The final decision of a State Office as embodied in the order issued at the completion of any appellate proceed\u00ad ing regarding an application for assign\u00ad ment due to hardship or emergency re\u00ad quirements shall be subject to judicial FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 191\u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1974 35520 RULES AND REGULATIONS review as prescribed by Section 211 of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970. (2) If a State Office approves a hard\u00ad ship or emergency application, it shall assign a prime supplier and amount from the state set-aside to the applicant. To determine an appropriate prime sup\u00ad plier, the State Office may coordinate with the State representatives of the prime suppliers. (e) Authorizing document. The State Office shall issue to an applicant granted an assignment a document authorizing such assignment. A copy of the authoriz\u00ad ing document (or a summary) shall also be provided by the State Office to the designated State representative of the prime supplier assigned to the applicant. An authorizing document issued by the State Office pursuant to this section is effective upon issuance and represents a call on the prime supplier's set-aside volumes for the month of issuance, ir\u00ad respective of the fact that delivery of the product subject to the authorizing docu\u00ad ment cannot be made until the following month. An authorizing document not presented to either the prime supplier or a designated local distributor of the prime supplier within ten (10) days of issuance shall expire after that time. (f) Supplier's responsibilities. Sup\u00ad pliers shall provide the assigned amount of an allocated product to an applicant when presented with an authorizing doc\u00ad ument. The authorizing document shall entitle the applicant to receive product from any convenient local distributor of the prime supplier from which the state set-aside assignment has been made. Wholesale purchaser-resellers of prime suppliers shall, as non-prime suppliers, honor such authorizing documents upon presentation, and shall not delay deli\u00ad veries required by the authorizing docu\u00ad ment while confirming such deliveries with the prime supplier. Any non-prime supplier which provides an allocated product pursuant to an authorizing docu\u00ad ment shall in turn receive, from its sup\u00ad plier an equivalent volume of the al\u00ad located product which shall not be con\u00ad sidered part of its allocation entitlement otherwise authorized by this part. (g) Prime suppliers . All prime sup\u00ad pliers shall supply products from their state set-aside volume each month, as directed by the State office, not to exceed the total state set-aside volume for each product for that month. That portion of a prime supplier's state set-aside volume for a particular month which is not allo\u00ad cated by. the State office during that month or which is not subject to an authorizing document issued no later than the last day of that month shall become a part of the prime supplier's total supply for the subsequent month and shall be distributed according to the allocation procedures set forth in this part. (h) Release of State set-aside. Cl) At any time during the month, the State office may order the release of part or all of a prime supplier's set-aside vol\u00ad ume through the prime supplier's nor\u00ad mal distribution system in the State;(2) From time to time, the State office may designate certain geographical areas within the State as suffering from an intra-State supply imbalance. At any time during the month, the State office may order some or all of the prime sup\u00ad pliers with purchasers within such geo\u00ad graphical areas to release part or all of their set-aside volume through their nor\u00ad mal distribution systems to increase the allocations of all of the supplier's pur\u00ad chasers located within such areas. (3) Orders issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be in writing and ef\u00ad fective immediately upon presentation to the prime supplier's designated State representative. Such orders shall repre\u00ad sent a call on the prime supplier's set- aside volumes for the month of issuance irrespective of the fact that delivery can\u00ad not be made until the following month., \u00a7 211.21 Energy conservation. To promote the goal of increased en\u00ad ergy conservation, every wholesale pur\u00ad chaser or end-user receiving an alloca\u00ad tion pursuant to the operation of this part shall certify that it has an energy conservation program in effect. Every end-user or wholesale purchaser-con\u00ad sumer whose allocation level is one hundred (100) percent of current re\u00ad quirements for any allocated product shall make a similar certification to its supplier. \u00a7 211.22 Administrative actions. (a) Inventories of crude oil and allo\u00ad cated products. No refiner, importer, wholesale purchaser or end-user shall accumulate inventories of any crude oil or allocated product which exceed cus\u00ad tomary inventories maintained by that refiner, importer, wholesale purchaser or end-user in the conduct of its normal business practices unless otherwise directed by the FEA. Normal inven\u00ad tory practices shall be observed in deter\u00ad mining allocable supplies of crude nil or allocated products in each period which corresponds to a base period. The FEA may review inventory practices and di\u00ad rect an increase or decrease in inven\u00ad tories if: (IX The inventory practices employed are inconsistent with the provisions of this part; (2) The inventory practices circum\u00ad vent or otherwise violate other provi\u00ad sions of this part ; or (3) The FEA determines that an adjustment is necessary in order to allo\u00ad cate crude oil or allocated product supplies consistent with the objectives of the Mandatory Petroleum Allocation Program.

If the estimated aggregate amount of crude oil to be produced in and imported into the United States in any allocation quarter is less than the aggregate amount of crude oil produced in and imported into the United States in the corresponding period of 1972, re\u00ad finer-buyers for that allocation quarter shall have the amount of crude oil that they would otherwise be entitled to pur\u00ad chase reduced on a pro rata basis. (2) A refiner-buyer's refinery capacity for the purposes of paragraphs (a) (6) and (c) (2) of this section and volume of crude oil runs to stills for the year 1972 and for the period February through April, 1974 shall (i) include (A) the volume of crude oil processed by another refiner for that refiner-buyer pursuant to a processing agreement and (B) the volume of crude oil processed by that refiner-buyer for a person other than a refiner pursuant to a processing agree\u00ad ment, and (ii) exclude the volume of crude oil processed by that refiner- buyer for another refiner pursuant to a processing agreement. (3) A refiner-buyer's volume of crude oil runs to Stills for the period February through April, 1974 shall exclude (i) the volume of crude oil runs to stills in such period attributable to crude oil pur\u00ad chased by that refiner-buyer in such period pursuant to the provisions of this subpart and (ii) the volume of crude oil runs to stills in siich period attribut\u00ad able to imports of crude oil in such period in excess of the reported estimate of crude oil imports of that refiner-buyer for such period. (4) Upon application by a refiner- buyer prior to May 20,1974, for purposes of the calculations in paragraph (a) (1) of this section, the FEA may adjust such refiner-buyer's reported volume of crude oil rims to stills for the year 1972 to compensate for reductions in volume due to unusual or nonrecurring operating conditions. The FEA may at any time, for purposes of such calculations andwithout application by the refiner-buyer concerned, adjust the volume of crude oil runs to stills of a refiner-buyer for the year 1972 or for the period February through April, 1974, if it determines that such refiner-buyer's reported volume of crude oil runs to stills for such year or period is inaccurate or not representa\u00ad tive of normal operating conditions*, (5) For purposes of the calculations in paragraph (a) (1) of this section, the volume of crude oil runs to stills of a refiner-buyer in 1972 shall be (i) in\u00ad creased by the volume of crude, oil nec\u00ad essary to operate any new refining ca\u00ad pacity of that refiner-buyer at the supply to capacity ratio at which all refineries of that refiner-buyer operated in the year 1972, taking into considera\u00ad tion crude oil supplies (in excess of supplies included in its February through April, 1974 crude oil runs to stills) avail\u00ad able to that refiner-buyer for such new capacity, and (ii) decreased by the vol\u00ad ume of crude oil runs to stills of such refiner-buyer attributable to any refin\u00ad ing capacity which has ceased to be op\u00ad erated continuously in the normal course of business since December 31, 1972. (6) No allocation shall be made under this subpart which will result in crude oil supplies in excess of 100 percent of refinery capacity to any refiner-buyer. (7) Each refiner-buyer shall process in its refineries, or have processed for its account by another refiner, any crude o\u00fc purchased under this subpart in, or within a reasonable time following, the allocation quarter in which such crude oil was so purchased. (b) Future refining capacity. (1) Not\u00ad withstanding any provisions of para\u00ad graph (a) of this section to the contrary, future refining capacity of a refiner- buyer shall be eligible to receive alloca\u00ad tions of crude oil, as hereinafter provided. Each refiner-buyer that wishes to receive an allocation under this paragraph (b) shall apply to FEA in accordance with the procedures established in Subpart G of Part 205 of this chapter. No such ap\u00ad plication shall be made until such future capacity will become operational in the allocation quarter for which the alloca\u00ad tion is sought. In no event shall any such application be made less than 60 or more than 90 days prior to the commence\u00ad ment of such allocation quarter. The FEA may specify a fixed or varying allocation amount or amounts of crude oil for such future refining capacity, and in so doing shall consider the following factors: (i) The source and volume of antici\u00ad pated crude oil supplies for such future refining capacity; (ii) the efforts made by that refiner- buyer to obtain or locate crude oil sup\u00ad plies for such future refining capacity; , (iii) the projected ability of all refiner- sellers to obtain supplies of crude oil for their refinery Capacity; (iv) the economic feasibility of operat\u00ad ing such future refining capacity absent any allocations; (v) the extent to which such future re\u00ad fining capacity is designed to implement the national policies relating to protec-. tion of the environment; and FEDERAL REGISTER, V O L 3 9 , N O . 1 9 1 \u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER T, 1 9 7 4 35526 RULES AND REGULATIONS (vi) the extent to which such future refining capacity incorporates high con\u00ad version facilities and the patterns of product yield conform to the anticipated national requirements for refinery products. (2) The PEA will endeavor to assure supplies to future refining capacity to enable such capacity to operate at the ^ national supply to capacity ratio. (c) Computation of total allocation obligation, (1) Prior to May 20, 1974, each refiner-buyer,, shall report to the FEA, as provided in \u00a7 211.66, its volume of crude-oil runs to stills for the year 1\u00da12 and for the period February through April, 1974, which reported vol\u00ad ume shall reflect the adjustments speci\u00ad fied in paragraph (a) (2), (3), <4) and (5) of this section. The FEA will then compute the quantity of crude oil which each refiner-buyer will be eligible to pur\u00ad chase during an allocation quarter. The sum of the quantities of crude oil that all refiner-buyers are eligible to purchase for delivery dining an allocation quarter shall be the total allocation obligation for refiner-sellers for such allocation quarter. (2) The quantity of crude oil that a refiner-buyer shall be eligible to pur\u00ad chase under this subpart in an allocation quarter shall he reduced by the amount of crude oil available to that refiner- buyer in a prior allocation quarter that resulted in crude nil supplies in excess of 100 percent of that refiner-buyer's re\u00ad finery capacity, except that such reduc\u00ad tion based on crude oil supplies in any prior allocation quarter shall not be for an amount in excess of the volume of crude oil actually purchased by that re\u00ad finer-buyer under this subpart in such prior allocation quarter. (3) The purchase opportunity of each refiner-buyer which was classified as a refiner-seller in the period February through April, 1974 and did not sell its total required quantity of crude oil in such period pursuant to the buy/sell list published by the FEA shall be reduced by such unsold amount in the allocation quarter commencing June 1,1974. (4) The quantity of crude oil that a refiner-buyer shall be eligible to pur\u00ad chase under this subpart in the alloca\u00ad tion quarter commencing June 1, 1974, shall be (i) reduced by the excess of the volume of domestic crude oil nms to stills of that refiner-buyer for the period February through April, 1974 over the reported estimated domestic crude oil runs to stills of that refiner-buyer for such period and (ii) increased by (A) the excess of such estimated domestic crude oil runs to stills for such period over the volume of its domestic crude oil runs to stills for such period, and (B) the excess of the reported estimates of im\u00ad ported crude oil runs to stills of that re\u00ad finer-buyer for such period over the vol\u00ad ume of its imported crude oil runs to stills for such period. (d) Refiner-sellers* sales obligations. (1) Each refiner-seller shall offer for sal\u00e9 fcrude oil, directly or through ex\u00ad change, to refiner-buyers. The quantity of crude oil that each refiner-seller shallbe required to offer for sale to refiner- buyers during an allocation quarter shall be equal to that refiner-seller's fixed per\u00ad centage share multiplied by the total al\u00ad location obligation for the particular al\u00ad location quarter, as adjusted in this para\u00ad graph (d ). A refiner-seller's fixed per\u00ad centage share is its proportionate share of the total refining capacity of all re\u00ad finer-sellers as reported to the Bureau of Mines on January 1, 1973, as certified by the FEA. New refining capacity or future refining capacity shall not subject a refiner-seller to any increase in its fixed percentage share. (2) The quantity of crude oil that a refiner-seller shall be required to offer for sale in the allocation quarter com\u00ad mencing June 1; 1974, shall be (i) in\u00ad creased by the excess of the volume of domestic crude oil runs to stills of that refiner-seller for the period February through April, 1974. over the reported estimated domestic crude oil runs to stills of that refiner-seller for such period and (ii) reduced by (A) the excess of such estimated domestic crude oil runs to stills for such period over the Volume of its domestic crude oil runs to stills for such period, and (B) the excess of the re\u00ad ported estimates of imported crude oil runs to stills of that refiner-seller over the volume of its imported crude oil runs to stills for such period. For pur\u00ad poses of this paragraph (d) (2) a refiner- seller's crude oil runs to stills shall reflect the adjustments in paragraph (a) (2) of this section and include amounts sold and exclude amounts purchased under this subpart in the period February through April, 1974. (3) In each allocation quarter, each refin\u00e9r-seller that did not sell its total quantity of crude oil required to be of\u00ad fered for sale under this subpart in the prior allocation quarter or, in the case of the allocation quarter commencing June 1, 1974, the period February through April, 1974, shall first be required to offer for sale such unsold amount to refiner-buyers; provided, however, that such unsold amount in such prior allo\u00ad cation quarter or period shall constitute a sales obligation of a refiner-seller only for the allocation quarter immediately following such prior allocation quarter or period. (4) In calculating the quantity of crude oil that each refiner-seller is re\u00ad quired to offer for sale in an allocation quarter, the aggregate of the quantities of crude oil required to be sold under paragraph (d) (3) of this section shall be deducted from the -total allocation obli\u00ad gation for such allocation quarter, and the balance shall be offered for sale by all refiner-sellers in accordance with their respective fixed percentage shares. Sales by a refiner-seller in an allocation quarter shall be deemed to be first in satisfaction of that refiner-seller's obli\u00ad gation under paragraph (d) (3) of this section, to the extent of such obligation, and next in satisfaction of that refiner- seller's fixed, percentage share of such balance. (5) For the allocation quarter com\u00ad mencing June 1, 1974, after calculation of the amount of each refiner-seller'sfixed percentage share of the total allo\u00ad cation obligation less the quantities of crude Oil required to be sold Under para\u00ad graph (d) (3) of this section, the adjust\u00ad ments specified in paragraph (d) (2) of this section shall be made to such amount. To the extent that the aggre\u00ad gate of such adjusted obligations of all refiner-sellers either exceeds or is le s s^ than the total allocation obligation lesr such quantities under paragraph (d) (3) of this section, the adjusted Obligation of each refiner-seller (exclusive of amounts required to be sold under para\u00ad graph (d )(3 )''of this section) shall b e either reduced or increased, as the case may- be, by its fixed percentage share of such excess or shortfall. (e) Buy-sell list. On the first day of the allocation quarter commencing June 1 , 1974, and 15 days prior to each subse\u00ad quent allocation quarter, the FEA shall publish a notice for that allocation quar\u00ad ter listing the quantity of crude oil each refiner-buyer is eligible to purchase, the total allocation obligation for all refiner- sellers, the fixed percentage share for each refiner-seller and the quantity that each refiner-seller will be obligated to offer for sale to refiner-buyers. The cohi- mencem\u00e9ht date for starting deliveries under sales agreements in an allocation quarter shall be 15 days after publication of the related notice. Any agreements for the sale or purchase of crude oil after s\u00fcch commencement date shall be retro\u00ad active to the starting delivery date. All deliveries must be completed or arranged for before , the end of the. allocation quarter. (f) Sale/purchase transaction report Within fifteen days of the publication of the notice under paragraph (e) of th is section, each transaction made to comply with this program shall be reported b y the buyer and seller to the FEA. This re\u00ad port shall identify the selling refiner an d purchasing refiner-buyer and indicate the volumes of the crude oil sold or pur\u00ad chased. (g) Conditions of sale. (1) The term s and conditions of each sale of crude oil, other than the prices, shall be consistent with normal business practices. The crude oil offered must be suitabl\u00e9 for processing in and practical for delivery to th\u00e9 refiner-buyer. (2) All crude oil transferred pursuant to this section shall be priced in accord\u00ad ance with the provisions of Part 2 1 2 of this chapter. (3) Exchanges of crude oil may b e utilized to comply with the purchase an d sale provisions of this section. (hr Failure to negotiate transactions. (1) Each refiner-buyer shall use its b est effort to consummate the purchases of crude oil under this subpart from refiner- sellers prior to requesting assistance from the FEA. A refiner-buyer that is unable to negotiate a contract to purchase crude oil within 15 days of the publication of the notice specified in paragraph (e) of this section may request after the expira\u00ad tion of such 15 day period that the FEA direct one or more refiner-sellers to sell an acceptable type of crude oil to su ch refiner-buyer.

As used in this section\u2014 \"Adjustment factor\" means the per\u00ad centage established by the FEA by which the base percentage yield of a particular refined petroleum product or residual fuel oil is multiplied to obtain the ad\u00ad justed percentage yield of that particu\u00ad lar product or residual fuel oil. \"Adjusted percentage yield\" means the product of the base percentage yield of a particular refined petroleum product or residual fuel oil multiplied by the ad\u00ad justment factor for that product or re\u00ad sidual fuel oil. \"Base percentage yield\" means the ratio expressed as a percentage, which the total number of barrels of a particu\u00ad lar refined petroleum product or residual fuel oil produced by a refiner during a specified base period bears to the refin\u00ad er's total crude runs to stills in that base period. (2) Adjustment of base percentage yield. Whenever a refined petroleum product or residual fuel oil is or will be in short supply, the FEA may require refiners to adjust their base percentage yield of that product or residual fuel oil in order to increase the relative output ofthat product or residual fuel oil in short supply. If the FEA determines that an adjustment to the base percentag\u00e8 yield of a particular refined petroleum prod\u00ad uct or residual fuel o\u00fc is necessary, the FEA shall publish an adjustment factor by which each refiner must multiply its base percentage yield of that product or residual fuel oil to obtain the adjusted percentage yield of that product or residual fuel oil. (3) Joint compliance. Upon approval by the FEA, two or more refiners may ad\u00ad just their base percentage yield of a par\u00ad ticular refined petroleum product or re\u00ad sidual fuel oil on a pooled basis, such that the combined production of that product or residual fuel oil by the two or more refiners would equal the combined pro\u00ad duction of those refiners if each refiner had separately equalled or exceeded its adjusted percentage yield of that prod\u00ad uct or residual fuel oil. (d) Allocation of crude oil. The FEA may adjust the quantities of crude oil allocated among refiners under \u00a7 211.65 in a manner designed to ensure desired production levels* of refined petroleum products or residual fuel oil in short sup\u00ad ply for which an adjustment factor has been established. Such adjustments shall be designed to meet the objectives of this chapter and of the Act, such that refiners which increase production in excess of their adjusted percentage yield of that product or residual fuel oil, or less than the adjusted percentage yield of that product or residual fuel oil may be allo\u00ad cated greater or lesser quantities of crude oil during the next allocation quarter, respectively. . . . Appendix \u2014 Sp\u00e9cial Rule No. 1 1. Scope. This special rule applies to all refiner-buyers and refiner-sellers during th\u00e9 crude oil sales period commencing Febru\u00ad ary 1, 1974.

Included within the definition of butane is the butane content of other mixtures in which either or both butane isomers con\u00ad stitute greater than ten (10) percent of the mixture by weight. \"Bottled butane\" means butane bot\u00ad tled in cylinders with a capacity of one hundred (100) pounds or less; Provided, That the cylinders are not manifolded at the time of sale. \"Merchant storage facility\" means any facility which is utilized to store butanefor firms other than the owner or opera\u00ad tor o'f such a facility. \"Natural gasoline\" means those liquid hydrocarbon mixtures containing sub\u00ad stantial quantities of pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons, which have been extracted from natural gas. \"Plant protection fuel\" means the use of butane in the minimum volume re\u00ad quired to prevent physical harm to plant facilities or danger to plant personnel. This includes the protection of such ma\u00ad terial and equipment which would other\u00ad wise be damaged, but does not include sufficient quantities of butane required to maintain plant production. Butane may not be considered plant protection fuel if an alternate fuel is available and technically feasible for substitution. \"Process fuel\" means butane used to convert a substance from one form to another such as in applications requiring precise temperature controls or precise flame characteristics. Butane may not be considered process fuel if an alternate fuel is available and technically feasible for substitution. \"Standby volumes\" means those vol\u00ad umes of butane used by an industry as a temporary substitute for another prod\u00ad uct (such as natural gas) in times of shortage or curtailment of the other product. Volumes of butane, which are used as a temporary substitute for a proc\u00ad ess fuel or plant protection fuel are not considered standby volumes for purposes of this subpart. \"Where no substitute for butane is available\" means those circumstances in which no alternate fuel is available or in which a firm has historically relied upon butane as its sole fuel source. \u00a7 211.93 Allocation levels.

PEA may require the wholesale pur\u00ad chaser-consumers to submit additional information to justify the adjustment. FEA may approve, deny or modify the adjustment. New wholesale purchasers and end-users are subject to the require\u00ad ments of \u00a7 211.12. (b) The provisions of \u00a7 211.12(e) (1) concerning mutual arrangements be\u00ad tween new wholesale purchaser- consumers and suppliers shall not apply to this subpart. New wholesale pur\u00ad chaser-consumers must apply to the PEA National Office for an assignment pur\u00ad suant to \u00a7 211.12(e) (3) in order to estab\u00ad lish a supplier/purchaser relationship and a base period volume. Such applica\u00ad tions shall be filed in accordance with Subpart C of Part 205 of this chapter. (c) Operators of storage facilities, in\u00ad cluding merchant storage facilities, shall not release for shipment to gas utilities any quantity of butane which, when taken together with other amounts of butane supplied to that utility for a period corresponding to a base period, exceeds the quantity of butane which may be supplied under the allocation level for gas utilities in \u00a7 211.93(c) (2) (iv). (d) Suppliers with two or more dis\u00ad tribution subsystems or regions inde\u00ad pendent of one another may calculate separate allocation fractions for each such area provided that the supplier noti\u00ad fies the PEA by certified mail of the use of multiple allocation fractions and fully justifies such practices at least fifteen days prior to distributing any supplies pursuant to multiple allocation fractions. The FEA may disallow the use of multi\u00ad ple allocation fractions to the extent that it determines that such a practice con\u00ad travenes the intent of this part. (e) Suppliers and wholesale pur\u00ad chasers (except gas utilities and indus\u00ad trial users) shall be permitted to accu\u00ad mulate an inventory of butane during the summer in quantities which are nor\u00ad mal and reasonable for seasonal usage in accordance with their normal business practices. Inventories controlled by gas utilities and industrial users (including petrochemical producers) shall be limited to: (1) One hundred (100) percent of the allocation entitlement specified in \u00a7 211.93 for gas utilities. (2) One hundred twenty (120) per\u00ad cent of the volumes used for all indus\u00ad trial uses (including standby volumes) during the period April 1, 1972 through March 31,1973; Provided, however, That an industrial firm may not use such in\u00ad ventories to exceed its allocation entitle\u00ad ment specified in \u00a7211.93. As long as a firm controls greater than the above mentioned inventories, it shall not accept an allocation from a supplier until its inventories are reduced to con\u00ad form to the limits imposed in this para\u00ad graph.\u00a7 211.97 Procedures and reporting re\u00ad quirements. (a) All owners of storage facilities, in\u00ad cluding merchant storage facilities (or operators thereof), with a capacity in excess of 500,000 gallons which store butane, shall report to the Administra\u00ad tor, FEA, Washington, D.C. 20461, the total volume, locations, and ownership of butane storage including that owned by the storage owner or operator of affili\u00ad ated companies, and that held in transit. If it is not possible to report each sepa\u00ad rate account of \"in transit\" storage, then the total volume shall be reported. The same information shall be reported as of the end of each month on form PEA #103B and filed within fifteen (15) days after the close of that month. All owners of butane in merchant storage facilities shall file form PEA # 1Q1A with the oper\u00ad ator of the storage facility. These reports shall be kept on file by the storage opera\u00ad tor, and are subject to FEA audit. (b) All applications for adjustment and assignment of butane and natural gasoline shall be filed with the PEA Na\u00ad tional Office in accordance with Sub\u00ad parts B and C, respectively, of Part 205 of this chapter.

For purposes of this subpart\u2014 \"Base period\" means the month of 1972 corresponding to the current month. \"Bulk purchaser\" means any firm which is an ultimate consumer which, as part of its normal business practices, pur\u00ad chases or obtains motor gasoline from a supplier and either (a) receives de\u00ad livery of that product into a storage tank substantially under the control of that firm at a fixed location, (b) with re\u00ad spect to use in agricultural production, receives delivery into a storage tank with a capacity not less than 50 gallons sub\u00ad stantially under the control of that firm, or (c) receives delivery of that product FEDERAL REGISTER, V O L 3 9 , N O . 1 9 1 \u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1 9 7 4 35532RULES AND REGULATIONS for use in cargo, freight and mail hauling by truck. \"Truck\" means a motor vehicle with motive power designed primarily for the transportation of property or special pur\u00ad pose equipment and with a gross vehicle weight rating for a single vehicle (the value specified by the manufacturer as the loaded weight of the vehicle) or the equivalent thereof in excess of 20,000 pounds, or in the case of trucks designed primarily for drawing other vehicles and not so constructed as to carry a load other than part of the weight of the vehicle and the load so drawn, with a gross combination weight rating (the value specified by the manufacturer as the loaded weight of the combination vehicle) or the equivalent thereof in excess of 20,000 pounds. \u00a7 211.103 Allocation levels. (a) General. The allocation levels listed in this section only apply to alloca\u00ad tions made by suppliers to end-users which are bulk purchasers and to whole\u00ad sale purchaser-consumers. Suppliers shall allocate to all purchasers to which the allocation levels apply in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 211.10. End- users which are bulk purchasers and wholesale purchaser-consumers which are entitled to purchase motor gasoline under an allocation level not subject to an allocation fraction shall receive first priority and be supplied sufficient amounts to meet 100 percent of their al\u00ad location requirements. End-users which are bulk purchasers and wholesale pur\u00ad chaser-consumers which are entitled to purchase motor gasoline for all uses under an allocation level subject to re\u00ad duction by application of an allocation fraction shall receive second priority. (b) Allocation levels not subject to an allocation fraction. One hundred (100) percent of current requirements for the following uses: ( 1 ) Agricultural production; (2) Department of Defense use as specified in \u00a7 211.26.

(d) Purchasers without an allocation level. There shall be no allocation levels for end-users which are not bulk pur\u00ad chasers or for purchasers which are not otherwise described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Such end-usersshall be supplied in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 211.10(d) (2). (e) Wholesale purchaser-resellers. Wholesale purchaser-resellers shall re\u00ad ceive allocations on the basis of their base period volumes as determined by \u00a7 211.12(c) and adjusted in vided in \u00a7 211.106. Retail sales General. Notwithstanding the pro\u00ad visions of \u00a7 211.11, the provisions of this section shall apply to retail sales outlets which sell motor gasoline. (b) Retail sales outlets as a firm. (1) Each firm or part of a firm which oper\u00ad ates an ongoing business at a retail sales outlet shall be considered a separate firm with respect to each such outlet for pur\u00ad poses of this subpart and, therefore, shall be a separate wholesale purchaser-re\u00ad seller. The entity which merely holds a real property interest in a retail sales outlet on which another entity operates the ongoing business shall not be con\u00ad sidered the wholesale purchaser-reseller with respect to that outlet. (2) An independent marketer, or a small or independent refiner, which op\u00ad erates two or more retail sales outlets may apply to the FEA for treatment ot some or all of such outlets as a single firm in accordance with the procedures established in Subpart G of Part 205 of this chapter. The FEA may allow such treatment to the extent that the petition\u00ad er can demonstrate that treatment of each outlet as a separate firm would tend to lessen its competitive market position and that allowance of the petition would not result in an inequitable distribution of gasoline in the market areas served by that marketer. (3) (i) A supplier's obligation to pro\u00ad vide motor gasoline shall be determined separately for each retail sales outlet for which it has a supply obligation with\u00ad out distinguishing between retail sales outlets operated by the supplier and retail sales outlets not operated by the supplier. A supplier may not reassign all or part of an allocation entitlement from one retail sales outlet to another, includ\u00ad ing reassignments among its own retail sales outlets, without the express written permission of FEA except as provided by paragraph (b) (3) (ii) of this section unless an application for treatment as a single firm of some or all of such sup\u00ad plier's retail sales outlets has been granted pursuant to paragraph (b) (2) of this section. (ii) An independent marketer, or small or independent refiner, may reassign up to twenty (20) percent of the allocation entitlement (excluding any amounts which those retail sales outlets have cer\u00ad tified pursuant to \u00a7 211.12(d) to be foi ultimate use under an allocation level not subject to an allocation fraction) of a retail sales outlet which it operates to another retail sales outlet which it oper\u00ad ates provided that no retail sales outletmay have its allocation entitlement (ex\u00ad cluding any amounts which those retail sales outlets have certified pursuant to \u00a7 211.12(d) to be for ultimate use under an allocation level not subject to an allocation fraction) increased by more than twenty (20) percent pursuant to any reassignment permitted by this para\u00ad graph (b )(3 )(ii). If an independent marketer or small or independent re\u00ad finer is not the supplier of all of the re\u00ad tail sales outlets which it operates from a single terminal facility, it may make the reassignments permitted by this paragraph only among the retail sales outlets which it operates and which are supplied by the same supplier and terminal facility. (4) To the extent that retail sales out\u00ad lets have not been considered separate firms and therefore separate wholesale purchaser-resellers in the base period volume determination required under \u00a7 211.12(c), an operator of more than one retail sales outlet shall by July 1 , 1974, determine the base period volume of each of its retail sales outlets and calculate the adjustment to base period volume for unusual growth as specified in \u00a7 211.13(b) (1). To the extent that the sum of all the adjustments for each of its retail sales outlets as calculated by the operator differs from the unusual growth adjustment as calculated by the supplier in accordance with the provi\u00ad sions of \u00a7 211.13(b) (1) treating all out\u00ad lets together as a single firm, the opera\u00ad tor of the retail sales outlets shall notify the supplier. If the supplier disputes the automatic growth adjustment as calcu\u00ad lated by the operator, the operator shall make application to the appropriate FEA regional office for validation of the adjustment. (c) Loss of allocation entitlement for going out of business. (1) A wholesale purchaser-reseller which operates a re\u00ad tail sales outlet shall be deemed to have gone out of business with respect to that outlet for purposes of \u00a7 211.11 if it va\u00ad cates the site on which it conducts such business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an independent marketer shall not be deemed to have gone out of business if (i) the independent marketer vacates the site on which it formerly operated a retail sales outlet, (ii) the former site is closed as a retail sales outlet or is op\u00ad erated as such by a firm that is not an independent marketer, and (iii) the in\u00ad dependent marketer that occupied the former site, within a reasonable period of time, as determined by FEA, reestab\u00ad lishes another retail sales outlet at another location serving substantially the same customers or market that was served by the former site. (2) (i) Closings of retail outlets after June 1, 1974. An entity which operates more than one retail sales outlet and which intends to go or goes out of busi\u00ad ness at one or more such retail sales out\u00ad lets may apply to FEA for an adjustment to the base period volumes of its retail sales outlets which will remain in busi\u00ad ness. FEA may allow such adjustments to the extent that the vacating of bus*\" ness at a particular retail sales outlet does not result in an inequitable distn- FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 3 9 , N O . 1 9 1 \u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1 , 1 9 7 4 RULES ANO REGULATIONS35533 button of motor gasoline in the market areas served by the entity and that such an adjustment would not otherwise be inconsistent with the objectives of the allocation program; Pending FEA -action on an application, PEA may provide adjustments to the base period volumes' of the pertinent retail sales outlets, which will remain in business. (ii) Closings of retail outlets prior to June 1, 1974. An independent marketer, or a small of independent refiner which went out of business with respect to one or more retail sales outlets which it operated during the period January 1, 1973 through June 1, 1974, shall receive an adjustment on June-1, 1974 to the base period volumes of its retail sales outlets which remain in business. An in\u00ad dependent marketer or a small or inde\u00ad pendent refiner shall determine the net amount by which the base period vol\u00ad umes of the retail sales outlets which it operated and which went out of business during the period January 1, 1973 through June 1, 1974, exceed the base period volumes of the retail sales out\u00ad lets which it opened for business and operated during the period January 1, 1 9 7 3 through June 1, 1974. The bas\u00e9 pe\u00ad riod volumes of each retail sales outlet which the independent marketer or small or independent refiner operates as of June 1 , 1974 shall be increased by an amount which bears the same proportion to such net amount as the base period volume of the retail outlet bears to the sum of the base period volumes of all the retail sales outlets which the inde\u00ad pendent marketer, or small or independ\u00ad ent refiner operates as of June 1, 1974. The independent marketer or small or independent refiner shall certify the adjustments to the base period volumes of its retail sales outlets under this subparagraph to the supplier or sup\u00ad pliers of such retail sales outlets. If a supplier disputes the validity of such adjustments certified to it, it may apply to the appropriate regional PEA for val\u00ad idation of the amounts of such adjust\u00ad ments. During the period that a request for validation is pending, the supplier shall supply motor gasoline based upon adjustments under this subparagraph. <d) Suppliers of retail sales Cutlets. (1) The supplier of a retail sales outlet shall be that part of a firm which actual\u00ad ly furnishes or physically delivers the gasoline to the retail sales-outlet. The operator of one or more retail sales out- lets shall not be considered the supplier of its own retail sales outlets unless it' operates a terminal facility from which it furnishes a product to each outlet or unless it otherwise physically delivers the gasoline to each outlet. Y*: (2) Whenever an operator of a retail sales outlet goes out of business with espect to that retail sales outlet under Paragraph (c) of this section, the sup- if0erJ\u00eei ou^e^ shall, in calculating ai(.n ollocation fraction, remove the of the allocation1 entitlement of sales outlet from its supply unless the right to such allo- i transferred to a successor P\u00abfchaser-reseller under para\u00adgraph (e) of this section.(3) Any supplier which supplies its own operated retail sales outlets shall report to the National and appropriate regional FEA and to the appropriate State office whenever it ceases to supply any retail sales outlet, without regard to whether such retail sales outlet is operated by the supplier. (e) Transfer of entitlement. Whenever a wholesale purchaser-reseller is deemed to have gone out of busines in accord\u00ad ance with paragraph (c) of this section, the right to an allocation with respect to the retail sales outlet shall be deemed to have been transferred to its successor on the site, provided such successor es\u00ad tablished the same ongoing business on th\u00e8 site within a reasonable period of time, as determined by FEA, after its predecessor vacates the premises. \u00a7 211.107 Method o f allocation. / (a) The initial State set-aside level for motor gasoline for a particular month and state is three (3) percent of a prime supplier's estimated portion of its total supply for that month which will be sold into the State's distribution system for consumption within the State. Subsequent adjustments to the percent\u00ad age unit will be published by the FEA. (b) Allocations of motor gasoline to retail sales outlets and other purchasers shall be made as specified in \u00a7 211.10. Suppliers which have an allocation frac\u00ad tion greater than one (1.0) sh\u00e0ll dis\u00ad tribute their surplus product in accord\u00ad ance with the provisions of \u00a7 211.10(g) notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 211.- 106 with respect to reassignments among retail sales outlets. (c) Provisions to adjust a wholesale purchaser's base period volume are specified in \u00a7 211.13. New wholesale pur\u00ad chasers and end-users are subject to the requirements of \u00a7 211.12. \u00a7 211.108 Allocation o f unleaded gaso\u00ad line. (a) General. All the provisions of this subpart shall apply to all substances meeting the definition of motor gasoline, including unleaded gasoline, premium and regular gasoline without regard to the different characteristics of those sub\u00ad stances except as provided in this sec\u00ad tion with respect to unleaded gasoline. In addition to the provisions of \u00a7 211.105, a supplier of unleaded gasoline shall fur\u00ad ther allocate unleaded gasoline in ac\u00ad cordance with the provisions of this sec\u00ad tion to retail sales outlets and other pur\u00ad chasers which are entitled to receive motor gasoline (whether leaded or un\u00ad leaded) from that supplier without re\u00ad gard to whether the supplier has pre\u00ad viously supplied unleaded gasoline to that purchaser. (b) Definitions. \"Allocation entitle\u00ad ment\" means for a wholesale purchaser- entitlement as de\u00ad scribed in \u00a7 211.12(b) (1) and for a whole\u00ad sale purchaser-consumer or an end-user, its allocation entitlement as described in \u00a7 211.12(b) (2). \"Allocation ratio\" means that ratio of a supplier's total supply of unleaded gasoline to the supplier's total supply of motor gasoline (leaded and unleaded).\"Unleaded gasoline\" means unleaded gasoline as defined by the Environmen\u00ad tal Protection Agency. (c) Method of allocation for unleaded gasoline. (1) (i) For a period which cor\u00ad responds to a base period, each supplier shall make available to.each of its pur\u00ad chasers which are entitled to receive motor gasoline from that supplier a vol\u00ad ume of unleaded gasoline which bears the same ratio to that purchaser's allo\u00ad cation entitlement as the supplier's al\u00ad location ratio for that period. Suppliers may refuse to supply unleaded gasoline to any wholesale purchaser-reseller which does not have facilities suitable for the storage and delivery of unleaded gasoline, as required by the provisions of 40 CFR Ch. I, Part 80, Subpart B. (ii) This subparagraph (1) applies as of September 1, 1974, to all of the sup\u00ad plier's wholesale purchasers and end- user's which are entitled to receive motor gasoline from that supplier except those retail sales outlets which were not selling unleaded gasoline during the thirty (30) days prior to July 1, 1974, and which are not required to sell unleaded gasoline pursuant to 40 CFR Ch. I, Part 80, Sub\u00ad part B. This subparagraph becomes ap\u00ad plicable to retail sales outlets which were hot selling unleaded gasoline during the thirty (30) days prior to July 1, 1974 and which are not required to sell unleaded gasoline pursuant to 40 CFR Ch. I, Part 80, S\u00fcbpart B, on October 1, 1974. (2) No purchaser may be required to accept any quantity of unleaded gaso\u00ad line in lieu of part or all of its alloca\u00ad tion entitlement to motor gasoline for a period which corresponds to a base period. (3) (i) After its initial offer of unleaded gasoline pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph a supplier shall offer any of its supply of unleaded gasoline which remains only to its purchasers which are entitled to receive motor gaso\u00ad line from that supplier and which desire to purchase unleaded gasoline. Automo\u00ad bile manufacturers, new car dealers, fleet owners or operators, or any other whole\u00ad sale purchaser-consumers which require unleaded gasoline as a greater propor\u00ad tion of their allocation entitlement than the supplier' s allocatidh ratio shall have first priority to any such additional quantities of unleaded gasoline. (ii) Any supplier with a motor gas\u00ad oline allocation fraction less than or equal to one <1.0) which has a supply of unleaded gasoline that none of its pur\u00ad chasers entitled to receive motor gas\u00ad oline from that supplier desire to pur\u00ad chase shall notify FEA and may dispose of such supply in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 211.10(f) (2).

Unless otherwise specified, supplier/ purchaser relationships are set forth in \u00a7 211.9-13. \u00a7211.166 Method o f allocation. (a) State set-aside. The State set- aside level for residual fuel oil for a par\u00ad ticular month and State is three (3) per\u00ad cent of a prime supplier's estimated por\u00ad tion of its total supply of residual fuel oil for non-utility use for that month which will be sold into that State's distribution system for consumption within the State. Subsequent adjustments to the percent\u00ad age unit will be published by the FEA. (b) General. Based on the estimated total supply of residual fuel oil, on allo\u00ad cation levels set forth in \u00a7 211.163, on the State set-aside percentage and on other relevant considerations, the FEA shall determine the portion of total supply for non-utility use and the portion of total supply for utility use for delivery during a month or months in accordance withparagraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The FEA may make its determination for a single month or for several months at a time. (c) Non-utility. The portion of each supplier's allocable supply not directed by the FEA to be distributed for utility use shall be allocated pursuant to \u00a7 211.- 10. With respect to space heating uses, suppliers must comply, to the fullest ex\u00ad tent practicable, with the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section. Notwith\u00ad standing the provisions of \u00a7 211.165 or \u00a7 211.10, suppliers may not supply a utility in excess of the amounts estab\u00ad lished pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section until the non-utility allocation levels listed in \u00a7 211.163 have been filled, unless otherwise directed by the FEA. (d) Utilities. (1) For purposes of calcu\u00ad lating the allocation of residual fuel oil to utilities for delivery during the month of February 1974\u2014 (1) The FEA will determine the amount of residual fuel oil allocated to each utility for delivery during the month of February and publish that determina\u00ad tion. The volume of residual fuel oil allocated to each utility shall be based upon the supply available for utilities, the considerations specified in \u00a7 211.163 (b )(3) and other relevant considerations. (ii) Based upon total deliveries from suppliers during the base period, each utility shall calculate the percentage of the utility's total deliveries during the base period which were supplied by each supplier. Within 7 days following the date of notification of allocation amounts pur\u00ad suant to paragraph (d )(1 ) (i) of this section, each utility shall notify each of its suppliers and the FEA of the amount required to be supplied by each supplier for delivery in February 1974 and of the percentage of the amount allocated to each utility which each supplier must supply. The amount required to be sup\u00ad plied by a supplier shall be calculated by multiplying the utility's specified monthly allocation amount by the per\u00ad centage of the utility's total deliveries during the base period which were sup\u00ad plied by the supplier. (iii) Following notification by the utilities of the amounts and percentages required to be supplied by each supplier for delivery in February 1974, FEA will publish these percentages. (2) For purposes of calculating the allocation of residual fuel oil to utilities for delivery in every month after Feb\u00ad ruary 1974\u2014 (i) The FEA will determine the amount of residual fuel oil allocated for delivery to each utility for a single month or several months at a time. The volume of residual fuel allocated to each utility for each month shall be based upon the supply available for utilities, the con\u00ad siderations specified in \u00a7211.163(b)(3) and other relevant considerations. (ii) Following the determination in paragraph (d) (2) (i) of this section, the FEA will publish the amounts of residual fuel oil allocated to each utility for de\u00ad livery for a single month or several months at a time, and the amounts re\u00ad quired to be supplied for each month by each supplier. The amounts required tobe supplied by each supplier will be cal\u00ad culated by multiplying each utility's specified monthly allocation amount by the percentage of the utility's total de\u00ad liveries during the base period which were supplied by the supplier as com\u00ad puted from the information reported to FEA by the utility pursuant to the pro\u00ad visions of paragraph (d) (1) (ii) of this section. (3) Within 48 hours of the notifica\u00ad tion by the utility to the supplier re\u00ad quired in paragraph (d) (1) (ii) of this section, and within 7 days bf the date of publication by the FEA of the informa\u00ad tion set forth in paragraph (d) (2) (ii) of this section, or fifteen days prior to the beginning of the month in which the specified amount is to be delivered, whichever is later, each supplier of a utility shall notify that utility of its anticipated ability to supply, during the month for which the allocation amount is specified, the entire amount of residual fuel required to be supplied by that sup\u00ad plier. If a supplier of a utility is unable to supply its specified amount, the sup\u00ad plier may request an extension to the delivery period in that month of up to 1 2 days. Following receipt of a request for extension, the utility must notify the supplier within 48 hours of its determina\u00ad tion of the acceptability of the requested extension and of the amount to be delivered during the extension period. If the utility refuses to accept the ex\u00ad tension, the supplier and utility shall notify the FEA of the reason for the request for extension by the supplier and the refusal to accept the extension by the utility. The FEA shall then deter\u00ad mine the amounts to be delivered and the date or dates for delivery. (4) Suppliers and utilities may apply to the FEA for adjustment to the re\u00ad quirement of \u00a7 211.165 and paragraph (d) (1) (i) of this section, or assignment of a new supplier, in accordance with Subparts B and C, respectively, of Part 205 of this chapter. Such applications must be filed by the tenth day of the current month in order to be considered for decision or relief with respect to ad\u00ad justment to the allocation amounts to be published in the following month or assignment of a new supplier for the fol\u00ad lowing month. (5) Utilities may, and are encouraged to, by mutual agreement and after notice to FEA, apportion their respective allo\u00ad cated residual fuel oil volumes, other fuel volumes, or generated power among themselves. (e) Space heating uses. To the extent practicable, suppliers shall use the fol\u00ad lowing procedures for residual fuel oil distributed for space heating use. Sup\u00ad pliers to end-Users shall calculate the quarterly allotment of their customers for space heating using the most re\u00ad cently available usage factors on or be\u00ad fore November 1, 1973, for each building winter, and notify the end-user of its winter, and notify the end-user of his allotment. Where suppliers do not have an historical usage factor for a building, a usage factor shall be calculated based on gallons of fuel consumed and actual degree-days exposure in the base period. FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39 , N O . 1 9 1 \u2014 TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1 , 1974 RULES AND REGULATIONS 35539 For new buildings, the usage factor shall be determined based on gallons of fuel consumed and actual degree-days ex\u00ad posure during the latest thirty (30) day period of normal heating usage before January 15,1974. If no such period exists, a usage factor of that unit shall be es\u00ad tablished by an initial period of normal space heating operation, subject to re\u00ad view by the State Office. Suppliers to end-users shall recalculate monthly the quarterly allotment for each space heat\u00ad ing user by applying its usage factor to actual degree-days, less an adjustment for the required reduction in ambient in\u00ad door temperature. The supplier shall no\u00ad tify the end-user monthly of the end- user's adjusted allotment, and shall in\u00ad form the end-user whether and by how much its usage rate exceeds that re\u00ad quired to achieve the required reduction to ambient indoor temperature, and that it faces the danger of running out of fuel if it does not reduce its ambient indoor temperature as required by \u00a7 211.163(b) (2) (iv). The supplier shall notify the appropriate Regional FEO of any customer whose usage is excessive for two successive months. Suppliers' usage factors shall be associated with units (e.g., an apartment house) and not with end-users. The usage factor of record for a unit shall be used for that unit throughout the duration of his pro\u00ad gram regardless of changes in occupants or ownership. \u00a7 211.167 Procedures and reporting re\u00ad quirements.

Provide indicated data.for all petroleum products for the specified facility. (q) \"All other outputs\" (Code 800) includes all outputs not categorized in Codes 210 through 570, including unfinished products. (s) \"Natural gas liquids\" (Code 950) include such sub- stanccs as propane, normal butane, isobutane, butane-propane mixes, natural gasoline, isopentane, and plant condensate, when used as feedstocks for crude processing units . (t) \"Other inputs\" (Code 960) include unfinished oils and other hydrocarbons not included in codes 900 and 950, when used as feedstocks fo r crude process\u00ad ing units. (I) The entry in Column (I) \"Inventory: Start of Month\" for each product is the inventory of that product on-hand at beginning of the \"preceding month\" discussed above. In Column (2) \"Quantity Received\", enter the total amount of product shipments received during the month at the facility. (3) Figures entered in Column (3) \"Production\" may be either positive or negative, depending on the specific product involved. Normally, figures in this column indicate \"Production\" in the conventional sense, that is, they represent amounts of a product which arc produced and which thus add to the available supply of that product. There\u00ad fore, these figures are positive numbers. However, \"Production\" also entails the use of input materials. For example, the last three products on the list\u2014 Crude oil (Code 900) Natural gas liquids (Code 950), and Other inputs to crude oil processing units (Code 960)\u2014are consumed in the produc\u00ad tion of the other products on the list.

The purpose of this part is to assure the optimum use of the limited supplies of low sulfur petroleum products in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and the Clean Fuels Policy of the Environ\u00ad mental Protection Agency. This Part is not intended to affect or preempt the development of individual source com\u00ad pliance schedules or other actions asso\u00ad ciated with implementation of the Clean Air Act, except with regard to the timing of actual shifts to burning lower sulfur oil during the period this Part is in effect. \u00a7 215.2 Definitions. \"Power generator\" means any boiler, burner, or other combustor of fuel or any combination of boilers at a single site in any electric power generating plant or industrial or commercial plant having a total firing rate of 50 million B.T.U./hour or greater in commercial operation on or prior to December 7, 1973 and includes combustion turbines used in the genera\u00ad tion of electrical energy. \"Petroleum product\" means crude oil, residual fuel oil, and refined petroleum products as defined in Part 211 of this Title. \"Primary ambient air quality stand\u00ad ards\" means the national primary am\u00ad bient air quality standards provided for in the Clean Air Act, as amended. (42 U.S.C. 1857 et seq.)RULES AND REGULATIONS \u00a7 215.3 Power generators not currently burning petroleum produets. No petroleum product shall be sold or otherwise provided to or accepted by any firm for burning under power generators that were not using the petroleum prod\u00ad uct on December 7, 1973. Automatic ex\u00ad ception is granted for power generators converting from natural gas, provided that alternative fuels, such as coal, can\u00ad not practically be utilized. \u00a7 215.4 Power generators currently burn\u00ad ing petroleum products. (a) Petroleum products may continue to be purchased and utilized by firms us\u00ad ing them in power generators burning petroleum products on December 7, 1973 except that: (1) No petroleum product having a lower specified sulfur content, by weight, than the average content of the petro\u00ad leum products in use in such a power generator during November, 1973 or dur\u00ad ing the last month in which the power generator consumed such products, shall be sold or otherwise provided or accepted by any firm for use in such power generator; (2) The aggregate quantity of petro\u00ad leum products utilized by such firm in any month subsequent to April, 1974 in any such power generator capable of burning coal and petroleum products shall not exceed the larger of the aggre\u00ad gate quantity of petroleum products con\u00ad sumed in the corresponding month of 1972 or in July 1973, except that the quantity of petroleum products burned may be increased in proportion to the increased output of energy or increased need for startups. (3) The quantity of middle distillate fuel oil utilized by such firm in any month subsequent to April, 1974 in any such power generator shall not exceed the larger of the quantity of middle dis\u00ad tillate fuel oil consumed in the corre\u00ad sponding month of 1972 or in July 1973, except that the quantity of middle dis\u00ad tillate fuel oil burned may be increased in proportion to the increased output of energy, or increased need for startups. (4) In order to discourage further in\u00ad crease in the indirect use of middle dis\u00ad tillate and residual fuel oils: (i) No firm shall blend more middle distillate fuel oils into residual fuel oil than the greater of the quantities blended in the corresponding month of 1972, or in July 1973, except where essential to meeting Primary Ambient Air Quality Standards. (if) \u00d1o firm shall use under a power generator a blended fuel containing agreater proportion of middle distillate fuels from the larger o f: (A) The proportion included in the corresponding month of 1972, or (B) The proportion included in July 1973, except where essential to meeting Primary Ambient Air Quality Standards. (iii) Those quantities of fuels contain\u00ad ing middle distillates that constitute plant or firm inventories as of the effec\u00ad tive date of this Part may be consumed by or sold for use in power generators until those quantities are depleted. (5) Automatic exception is granted for power generators converting from nat\u00ad ural gas, provided that alternative non\u00ad petroleum product fuels, such as coal, cannot practically be utilized. \u00a7 215.5 New power generators. (a) Any firm with power generators which commenced commercial oper\u00ad ations after December 7, 1973 shall not utilize any petroleum products with sul\u00ad fur content by weight lower than that needed to meet Primary Ambient Air Quality Standards or to comply with EPA new source performance standards or for startup. (b) This part is not intended to pre\u00ad empt the new source performance stand\u00ad ards of the Clean Air Act, as amended. In the event this Part conflicts with su ch standards, the provisions of the Clean Air Act prevail and the provisions of this Part do not apply. \u00a7 215.6 Exceptions to meet p r im a r y am\u00ad bient air quality standards. (a) The FEA shall automatically grant exceptions to the provisions of this Part as provided in Subpart D of Part 2 0 5 of this chapter when the use of petro\u00ad leum products is properly certified by the appropriate State air pollution control agency to be essential to meeting the Primary Ambient Air Quality Standard of the air quality region in which the plant is located. (b) With respect to \u00a7 215.3, FEA shall grant exceptions pursuant to this para\u00ad graph only when suitable alternative non-petroleum product fuels are not available. \u00a7 215.7 Other exceptions. The FEA may also grant exceptions from the provisions of this Part as pro\u00ad vided in Subpart D of Part 205 of th is chapter if: (a) Any firm subject to this Part can demonstrate that compliance w ould cause an undue economic hardship; or (b) Fuels necessary for compliance with this Part are not available.
