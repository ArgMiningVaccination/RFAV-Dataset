ADPKD results from mutations in either the PKD1 or PKD2 gene, which encode the gene products polycystin 1 (PC1) and polycystin 2 (PC2), respectively. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) expression and activity are increased in Pkd1 mutant renal epithelial cells suggesting that it may play a role in cyst formation.

After she joined Dr. Anna Birukova and Dr. Konstantin Birukov's lab, she is concentrated in the study of molecular mechanisms in the regulation of lung endothelial barrier function and is trying to find novel barrier-protective and anti-inflammatory drugs in acute lung injury.

APF induces changes in expression of certain epithelial cell proteins, decreases tight junction formation, increases paracellular permeability, and profoundly inhibits the proliferation of normal bladder epithelial cells in vitro; these same changes have been confirmed in cells grown from IC/PBS patient biopsies as compared to normal controls, suggesting that APF may contribute to the pathogenesis of IC/PBS. Inhibition of APF activity or production may therefore be useful for the development of therapies for this disorder.
