Here, we break them down by category so you can choose what's best for you and your health goals. Tap Into [Nootropics](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/what-are-nootropics-all-about-herbs-and-activities-for-long-term-brain-health) For Cognitive Health And Memory No one likes to admit to having \"senior moments.\" However, occasional memory lapses and/or trouble concentrating are common side effects of aging. This can be compounded by other age-related issues, such as trouble sleeping or hormonal fluctuations due to menopause or andropause. If your cognitive health profoundly affects your everyday life and/or you have a family history of serious cognitive health issues, it's time to talk to your doctor. However, if you're only experiencing occasional absentmindedness these herbs may be able to help. [Saffron](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/saffron) Most are familiar with Saffron as a delicious (and expensive) delicacy found in dishes like authentic Spanish Paella or soups. However, few people know these precious hand-harvested crocus stems have demonstrated cognitive support benefits.* A systematic review of the effects of [Saffron](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/benefits-saffron%20) on cognitive function found it supported various aspects of cognitive function.*. REF#768 REF#769 [Ginkgo Biloba](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/ginkgo-leaf) Ginkgo is well-known in traditional herbalism for its beneficial effects on memory and other aspects of brain health.* Science has confirmed this traditional use, showing Ginkgo helps support memory and cognitive function related to neuropsychiatric health. It's also demonstrated potential benefits in slowing cognitive decline.REF#770 [Lemon Balm](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/lemon-balm-certified-organic) Lemon Balm boasts many health benefits for adults over 50 as a relaxant and immune-supportive herb.* It's also considered a nootropic, a classification of herbs that help support focus and brain health.* For example, Lemon Balm has been shown to support cognitive function and a positive mood.REF#771 [Lion's Mane](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/lions-mane-mushroom) Lion's Mane is a type of mushroom prized for its effects on brain health, memory, and other aspects of cognitive function.* In a study two months of Lion's Mane supplementation helped support healthy brain aging, motor function, neuron size, and function, inflammatory response, and longevity factors in mice.REF#772 Lion's Mane is delicious and can sometimes be found fresh in specialty stores or farmer's markets. It can also be taken as a supplement, such as [Gaia Herbs Lion's Mane Mushroom](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/lions-mane-mushroom) or [Mental Clarity Mushrooms & Herbs](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/collections/mushrooms-and-herbs). Saffron, Ginkgo, Lemon Balm come together in [Gaia Herbs Award-Winning Nootropic Focus. ](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/nootropic-focus) Stay Limber With These Herbs For Bone & Joint Health Nearly everyone takes mobility for granted during youth. However, as the years go by, joints and bones may experience some wear and tear. The best way to keep your joints and bones healthy is to eat a healthy diet with enough calcium and magnesium, avoid smoking, and exercise and stretch regularly.REF#773 In addition, herbs like [Turmeric](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/why-turmeric-is-truly-terrific) and [Maca](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/maca-dosage) may provide additional support.* [Turmeric](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/turmeric-supreme-extra-strength), also known as \"the Golden Spice,\" has been shown effective in supporting joint health, mobility, healthy aging, exercise recovery, and inflammatory response.REF#774 Turmeric contains many plant compounds, such as [Curcumin](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/curcumin-vs-turmeric), that provide powerful antioxidant benefits. Antioxidants help protect cells and tissues from the damaging effects of unstable molecules known as free radicals. Perhaps this is part of the reason many devoted yogis age so well. Consumption of daily Turmeric in the form of beverages, like [Golden Milk](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/golden-milk), and meals is commonplace in yogic and Ayurvedic (the traditional wellness practice of India) traditions. You can find Turmeric in various supplements, including these Gaia Herbs products: Bone health is another top concern for women over 50. If you're concerned about bone health, Ashwagandha may deserve a place in your supplement cupboard.* Also known as \"Indian Ginseng,\" this versatile herb is a staple in Ayurveda, the traditional wellness practice of India. It is traditionally used for various purposes related to stress, hormonal balance, sleep, anxiety, stamina, thyroid health, and immunity.* Ashwagandha has also demonstrated supportive properties for bone health during menopause.* A study on the effects of Ashwagandha in menopausal women published in Cell Death and Disease REF#775 found Ashwagandha's plant compounds, known as withanolides, \"increased expression of *osteoblast-specific transcription factor and mineralizing genes [*osteoblasts are bone-forming cells], promoted osteoblast survival and suppressed inflammatory cytokines.\" This is just one of many potential benefits of taking Ashwagandha for folks over (and under) 50. We'll discuss more of Ashwagandha's health benefits coming up.

Turn To Herbs For A More Youthful Heart Most people don't think much about their heart health before 50. However, given heart disease is still the world's #1 killerREF#777, it is wise to care for your heart as you age. In addition to eating a [heart-healthy diet](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/nutrition-is-key-to-cardiovascular-health), [addressing inflammation](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/at-the-heart-of-a-healthy-inflammatory-response), exercising, lowering stress, and [getting enough sleep](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/why-you-really-cant-sleep), some herbs have shown promise for supporting heart health in people of all ages.* [Hawthorne](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/herbs-to-help-support-a-healthy-and-happy-heart) has long been used in traditional herbalism to support normal heart and circulatory system functions.* Research has identified several plant compounds, including antioxidants known as oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) and flavonoids, believed In addition, phenolic acids, triterpenes, fatty acids, and sterols may also play a role. These compounds have demonstrated a supportive effect on various aspects of heart and circulatory function, including:REF#778 REF#779 - Coronary blood flow - Exercise tolerance - Inflammatory response - Antioxidant enzyme activity - Cholesterol balance - Blood pressure In other words, Hawthorne may provide a variety of benefits for a healthier heart.* Turmeric and its active component, Curcumin, have also demonstrated a broad range of supportive benefits for the heart in many studies.REF#780 One of the main ways Curcumin supports heart health is by promoting a healthy inflammatory response via its antioxidant properties.* This has downstream effects on blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, arterial integrity, and many other aspects of cardiovascular health.REF#781 Gaia Herbs has several synergistic formulas designed to support heart health, including*: - [Turmeric Supreme Heart Health](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/resveratrol-150)with Coleus, Ginger, Hawthorn, and Japanese Knotweed - [Hawthorne Supreme](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/hawthorn-supreme)with Hawthorn Berries, Leaves, and Flowers Discover more ways to promote heart health in: [Get Your Heart Pounding The Gaia Way](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/get-your-heart-pounding-the-gaia-way) Discover This WWII Herbal Secret For Healthy Eyesight Eyesight is often one of the first things to waver as we age. However, [eyesight problems](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/herbs-to-help-support-healthy-eyesight-and-protect-against-screen-fatigue) are no longer mainly exclusive to seniors and the over-50 crowd. Research has shown these issues are affecting people at younger ages. This is partly due to increased screen time and a lack of outdoor time. [Excess screen time](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/herbs-to-help-support-healthy-eyesight-and-protect-against-screen-fatigue) exposes the eyes to potentially damaging blue light while creating vision fatigue from excess short-range focus.REF#782 A lack of time spent outdoors robs us of natural sunlight (important for eye health)REF#783 and the opportunity to exercise our long-range vision as we focus on objects in the distance. So, less screen time and more time spent outdoors are two ways to help preserve your eyesight. Certain herbs, such as [Bilberry](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/bilberry), have also been shown helpful for promoting healthy eyesight.* A 2017 study published in PLOS One entitled: \"Neuroprotective effect of bilberry extract in a murine model of photo-stressed retina\" found bilberry extract supported healthy through its antioxidant properties.RE#784 Fun fact: Bilberry jam was given to British pilots during the second world war to help improve their night vision.REF#785 You can find Bilberry in [Gaia Herbs Healthy Vision](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/healthy-vision) with Lutein from Marigold\u2014another nutrient promotes eye health.REF#786 Try This High-Altitude Root For Libido Support Changes and dips in libido or sexual desire tend to be par for the course as we age. There are many reasons for this, such as hormonal changes\u2014including natural decreases in sex hormones during and post-menopause and andropause, certain medications, and other age-related health issues.REF#787 However, adults can stay sexually active well into their golden years if they choose to. It may take a little more effort than it did in your twenties, but a healthy sex life is absolutely possible. Maca Root can be an excellent complement to a healthy lifestyle for those needing libido support.* Maca, also known as \"Peruvian Ginseng,\" has demonstrated various potential benefits for libido in men and women.* For example, research published in The Journal of The North American Menopause Society showed Maca could help enhance sexual desire in post-menopausal women by reducing feelings of anxiety and depression.REF#788 Additional research published in BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies found Maca supported sexual desire in men and menopausal women over 50. REF#789 In a 12-week double-blind, of Lepidium meyenii (MACA) on sexual desire and its absent relationship with serum testosterone levels in healthy adult men, researchers concluded that Maca enhanced sexual desire in men after eight weeks of use.REF#790 There are several reasons Maca may help support sex drive in men and women, including its supportive effects on: - Sex hormones, like testosterone - Stress response ( [Maca is an adaptogen](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/why-we-love-maca-top-benefits-of-this-amazing-adaptogenic-herb), a type of herb that helps the body adapt to stress*) We discuss the possible mechanisms behind Maca's possible aphrodisiac qualities in detail in [Does Maca Root Work For Libido?

However, for many people, sleep becomes even more frustrating with age\u2014especially during menopause, andropause, or due to grief, pain, or other health issues. When sleep doesn't come easy due to hormonal fluctuations or stress, lean on [Ashwagandha](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/sleepthru) for support.* As previously mentioned, this herb is a prized staple in Ayurveda for supporting physical, mental, and emotional well-being.* It's also been shown effective in numerous studies\u2014including double-blind, placebo-controlled trials\u2014to provide the following sleep benefits REF#796 REF#797 REF#798 - Sleep duration - Sleep quality - Wake after sleep onset [Sleep efficiency](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/sleep-hygiene) - Mental alertness upon waking - Sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep) Scientists have concluded the active plant compound Triethylene glycol in Ashwagandha leaves is responsible for its positive effects on sleep.* Ashwagandha's effects on the HPA (hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal) axis, which governs your cortisol awakening response, have also been shown to support sleep.REF#799 REF#800 The cortisol awakening response refers to the naturally higher levels of cortisol (your body's master stress hormone) a healthy body should produce after a sustained rest period.REF#801 To learn how to take Ashwagandha for sleep, check out: [Ashwagandha Dosage: How To Take Ashwagandha Effectively](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/ashwagandha-dosage). for sleep in Gaia Herbs' best-selling [SleepThru\u00ae.](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/sleepthru) Tips On Getting Started With Supplements Over 50 Always check with your doctor or healthcare practitioner before beginning a new supplement regime. Although herbs are generally very safe and effective, some can interact with certain medications and may not be appropriate for people with certain conditions. It's also essential to choose the highest quality herbal supplements. High-quality herbal supplements will ensure you get all the benefits and nutrients of the herbs without worrying about contaminants, adulterations, or false labeling claims. Here's what to look for in high-quality herbal supplements: - Certified organic or wild-crafted herbs - Third-party testing for identity, purity, and contaminants - No artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, or fillers - Transparency in sourcing, like [Gaia Herbs' \"Meet Your Herbs\"](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/pages/meet-your-herbs)herb traceability program Finally, remember that you cannot out-supplement an unhealthy lifestyle. In other words, herbal supplements will work best with a healthy diet, regular exercise, stress management, good sleep, and social connections. All these together provide an excellent foundation for longevity and graceful aging. To learn more about supplements and other healthy ways to support yourself over 50, check out: REFERENCES: - 1.
