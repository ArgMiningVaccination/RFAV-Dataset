This is a common thing I hear, less and less from my clients who gain a deeper understanding the longer they work with me and explore and think about health in a new way, but quite common in conventional veterinary medicine. [You've seen them: the postcards that come, saying Spot or Puff is due for all those checked off diseases to be vaccinated against, with the date \"due\" prominently there.](https://vitalanimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Pet-Vaccination-Postcard.jpg) \"Make an Appointment Today!\" \"Don't let your protection lapse!\" \"Be responsible!\" It's worth taking a critical look at this before you leap into the car, pets in tow, for more vaccines. Have you gotten postcards like this every year for you? No? Why not? Largely, it's because you've been recognized to be immune from the vaccinations you had way back when you were young, and rolled up your sleeve and grimaced as the needle slid in. Immunology has recognized this phenomenon for a great many years. A practice that was started many years ago and that lacks scientific validity or verification is annual re-vaccinations. Almost without exception there is no immunologic requirement for annual revaccinations. Immunity to viruses persists for years or for the life of the animal. The above quote is from Current Veterinary Therapy, volume IX, in 1992. The authors were not alternative or holistic folks, they were veterinary immunologists, widely known in that field. [Here's a link](https://vitalanimal.com/vaccination-efficacy/) to part of the chapter, and some more efficacy information from my website. So, why so much emphasis still on repeating vaccinations? Even in the face of major voices in vet medicine speaking out against it, including the AVMA,AAHA and most veterinary schools? Follow the money, honey. Q: Who labels vaccines for yearly repetition? A: The manufacturers. Q: Based on studies showing the immunity disappears at around, say, day 364? A: No, nothing of the sort. Based on one thing, and one thing only. $$$ Sell more shots, make more money. Science is not involved in this part of the label at all. So, let's put it this way. If your doctor said it was really in your best interests to get vaccinated every year, would you do it? What would you want to read that would convince you this was necessary? I suspect it'd be more than a label on the vial of vaccine, right? Some research, done by scientists without ties to Big Pharma, measuring protective immunity. Wouldn't that be the basic starting point before you signed up and rolled up your sleeve? Followed by a listing of all the ingredients in that little vial. Followed by an in depth informed consent form that mentioned side effects. Don't hold your breath for any of this being forthcoming. But [DO some careful research](http://vitalanimal.com/vaccinations-consider-carefully/) before you haul your dog or cat (or child) in for more vaccinations. Especially if there were prior vaccines given and your animal is an adult. Tell me what you think in the comments. "}
