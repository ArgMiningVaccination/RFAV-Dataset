In- vestigators often use male rodents because they show metabolic disease better than females. Thus, femalesare not used precisely because of an acknowledged sex difference that represents an opportunity to under- stand novel factors reducing metabolic disease more in one sex than the other. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mandate to consider sex as a biological variable in preclinical research places new demandson investigators and peer reviewers who often lack expertise in model systems and experimental paradigmsused in the study of sex differences. This Perspective discusses experimental design and interpretation instudies addressing the mechanisms of sex differences in metabolic homeostasis and disease, using animalmodels and cells. We also highlight current limitations in research tools and attitudes that threaten to delayprogress in studies of sex differences in basic animal research. Introduction A pervasive attitude today among basic researchers is that mostmammalian physiological systems are fundamentally the same in males and females, and therefore studying one sex is usually sufcient to understand the basic principles of tissue functionand disease. We challenge this idea for metabolic homeostasis.Metabolic physiological systems are among those that show quite signicant differences caused by the inherently different biology of the two sexes. Nevertheless, many investigatorsfrequently rely on exclusively male rodents in research ( Zucker and Beery, 2010 ). Females are avoided as experimental subjects based on the concern that the estrous cycle induces variability intraits that complicate experimental designs. In fact, females have been found to be no more variable than males ( Becker et al., 2016; Itoh and Arnold, 2015; Prendergast et al., 2014 ). In the eld of metabolic disease, the use of male rodents may also be motivated by observations that males exhibit more pro- nounced disease phenotypes than females. For example, malesare used in studies in which obesity is induced with high-fat diet,and in studies using streptozotocin to induce insulin-decient diabetes ( Mauvais-Jarvis, 2015b ). In these cases, the omission of females is precisely because of an acknowledged biologicaldifference. In our view, studies of these sex differences should be emphasized, rather than ignored, because they present an opportunity to understand novel factors that reduce metabolicdisease more in one sex than the other ( Mauvais-Jarvis, 2015a ). In virtually any physiological study, the focus on a single sex threatens to limit the impact of research ndings, as resultsmay be relevant to only half of the population. To correct thisbias, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), under the pioneering efforts of Janine Clayton, Director of the Ofce of Women's Health Research, has recently mandated researchers to considersex as a biological variable in preclinical research, by includingboth sexes in research designs ( Clayton and Collins, 2014 ; NOT-OD-15-102, National Institutes of Health, 2015 ). Policies have been introduced for the design of grants by applicants and for the review of these grants by NIH study sections ( Tannen- baum et al., 2016 ). The importance of studying male and female models is not just a matter of being inclusive. Rather, the compar-ison of the two sexes raises questions that would otherwise not be asked: what are the forces that are protective more in one sex than the other, and can those forces be harnessed for bettertherapy ( Danska, 2014; Klein 2015a )? Even if a phenotype does not show an overall sex differ- ence, underlying mechanisms may still differ in the two sexes. Forexample, diverse sex-specic molecular pathways may have opposite effects and cancel out a sex difference, leading to sex- ual equivalence of the overt phenotype ( De Vries, 2004 ). The bal- ance between two sex-biased mechanisms may be disrupted by a physiological stress that affects one of the sex-biased mecha- nisms more than the other, with the result that the sex differencesmay emerge or disappear as the stress changes. Therefore,the recognition and identication of sex-specic biological pro- cesses will lead to better understanding of underlying mecha- nisms and drive novel discovery to improve therapy. The effort to encourage better study of both sexes places new demands on investigators and peer reviewers. Some NIH study sections lack expertise in model systems and experimentalparadigms used in the study of sex differences, which places burdens on reviewers and undermines the applicant's ability to propose research strategies effectively. We conceived thisPerspective as a discussion of the design and interpretation ofstudies to address the mechanisms causing sex differences in metabolic homeostasis and disease, using animal models and cells. We also highlight current limitations in research tools andattitudes that threaten to delay progress in sex differences 1216 Cell Metabolism 25, June 6, 2017 \u00aa2017 Elsevier Inc.in basic animal research. For further reading, please refer to valu- able resources that address detailed methods for sex- and gender-based basic and clinical research ( Becker et al., 2005 ) or the issue of sex inclusion in basic research ( Danska, 2014; Greenspan et al., 2007; Klein et al., 2015; Ouyang et al., 2016; Ri- chardson et al., 2015; Ritz et al., 2014; Tannenbaum et al., 2016 ). Sex and Gender Are Distinct In 2001, the Institute of Medicine published a review that empha- sized the need for clear denitions of sex and gender ( Wiseman and Pardue, 2001 ). Sex was dened as ''the classication of living things, generally as male or female according to their reproduc- tive organs and functions assigned by chromosomal comple-ment.'' gender was dened as, ''a person's self-rep- resentation as male or female, or how that person is responded to by social institutions on the basis of the individual's gender pre-sentation. Gender is rooted in biology and shaped by environ-ment and experience.'' In our view, sex differences in human traits are caused by a small cluster of inherent biological factors as a consequence of genetic, molecular, cellular, anatomical,and physiological events that interact with one another. In contrast, gender refers to male-female differences that are caused by environmental factors related to the social and culturalroles of individuals, and expectations of others ( Holdcroft, 2007 ). The sex-gender dichotomy therefore refers to two major classes of factors that make males and females phenotypically different.These biological and social/environmental factors influence each other and are completely intertwined. For example, differential social environments of males and females (because of social ex-pectations including body image and body weight, or stress thatvaries by gender because of gender-biased choice of occupa- tions, etc.) influence their biological phenotypes, including food intake, exercise, and obesity. Moreover, the biology of the indi-vidual also influences gender (for example, biological differences in body size and strength lead to gender-biased choices of occu- pations and environments). Yet, ''sex'' and ''gender'' are oftenused interchangeably and inappropriately in basic research. Some researchers prefer to use the term ''gender'' rather than ''sex'' because it sounds more polite or politically correct, oravoids any connotation of the sexual act. Although we acknowl-edge the importance of environmental and social factors to differ- entiate male and female humans, here we focus on biological sex differences in preclinical research. The study of animals is moti-vated often by this focus, because animals (like humans) share genes and hormones that make the two sexes different. Because most animals do not share the complex gendered social environ-ments of humans, studying animals is not informative about human gender ( Wiseman and Pardue, 2001 ). Of course, many an- imals have social environments too, which are different in the twosexes and contribute to sex differences in phenoptype (e.g., dif- ferential grooming contributing to sex differences in rats [ Moore and Power, 1992 ]). However, these socially induced differences are not usually similar to those of humans. Therefore, ''sex'' ap-plies more appropriately to male-female differences in basic research on nonhuman primates, rodents, birds, shes, flies, worms, and cells. ''Gender'' is best reserved for references tohuman beings ( Wiseman and Pardue, 2001 ). It has been proposed to divide sex differences into three cat- egories to inform experimental design ( McCarthy et al., 2012 ).The rst category encompasses sex differences that are extreme, leading to ''sex dimorphism'' in which the trait exists only in two forms, one found exclusively in males and the other exclusively in females. This is rare in metabolism but frequentin reproduction. The second category is the most common type of ''sex difference,'' in which the trait exists along a range in males and females and shows varying degrees of overlap,but the average is greater in one sex (for example, fat distribu-tion). The third case is when there is no observed sex difference in a trait at baseline but the underlying biology influencing this trait is markedly different in males and females such that thesex difference appears during physiological stress. For example, the overall energy balance is similar in males and females, but the survival strategy of male rodents following food deprivationis to reduce the loss of fat stores by increasing energy intake. Conversely, females reduce the loss of fat stores by decreasing energy expenditure ( Shi et al., 2007 ). The underlying neurobi- ology, which is not apparent under basal conditions, could resultfrom a sex difference in the density 2011 ). The Mouse Is a Tractable Metabolic System but Is Not a Human Most animal models of type 2 diabetes and obesity show some degree of sex differences, often with a more severe phenotype inmales. This is true for spontaneous, pharmacologically induced, or genetic diabetic models (associated or not with obesity and in- sulin resistance) in which males develop b-cell failure but females don't. Describing all of these models is beyond the scope of thisPerspective, but widely used models include the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat ( Lee et al., mouse ( Oyadomari et New Zea- land obese (NZO) mouse ( Plum et al., 2000 ), transgenic mice overexpressing the human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP)(Geisler et al., 2002; Janson et al., 1996 ), and mice with diabetes induced by treatment with streptozotocin ( Le May et al., 2006; Puah and Bailey, ) or alloxan ( al., 2014 ). Most rodent models of diet-induced obesity or insulin resistance also tend tohave more severe phenotypes in males ( Hevener et al., 2002; Hong et al., 2009 ). Importantly, sex differences in diabetes and obesity are also observed in humans with a male predominancein diabetes and a female predominance in extreme obesity ( NCD Risk Factor Collaboration et al., 2015 ). The purpose of rodent systems is to be experimentally more tractable than humans, so that causality between variables canbe proven beyond a doubt. Indeed, the study of rodents yields more accurate information about the basic architecture of bio- logical metabolic systems than can be obtained from the studyof humans. In addition, the study of animal models provides arich source of discoveries and new hypotheses that frame novel questions about human biology, especially because vertebrates share many of the genes and hormones that cause sex differ-ences in traits. However, despite the conserved underlying biological mechanisms to explain sex differences in animals and humans, there is no a priori expectation that studying Cell Metabolism 25, June 6, 2017 1217Cell Metabolism Perspectiverodents informs us directly about the human condition. Thus, new ideas arising from animal experiments need to be tested in humans as much as is possible. For example, the master regu- lator of energy balance, leptin, was initially discovered in themouse and subsequently found to share similar function in hu- mans ( Halaas et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 1994 ). The same is true for the insulin-sensitizing adipokine, adiponectin ( Scherer et al., 1995; Yamauchi et al., 2001 ). However, major differences be- tween rodents and humans are not a rationale to avoid studying rodents ( Richardson et al., 2015 ). Indeed, resolving why human physiology is similar to and different from that of animals pro-vides our best chance for understanding human physiology and disease. For example, mice decient in the insulin receptor (IR) die within the rst week of life from diabetic ketoacidosis ( Ac- cili et al., 1996; Joshi et al., 1996 ), whereas humans with mutant or missing IR exhibit relatively mild hyperglycemia (Ailhaud et al., 1992; Taylor, 1992 ). This species difference has allowed the dis- covery that insulin acting on the IGF-1 receptor is more effectivein humans than in mice in promoting glucose homeostasis ( Na- kae et al., 2001 ). The study of sex differences often requires the manipulation of gonadal hormones, which is achieved classically by removing the gonads and replacing the hormones one by one (as will be discussed below). There is a misconception that the study ofgonadectomized rodents is less relevant to humans because most humans have gonads. The point of this manipulation, how- ever, is that studying gonadectomized rodents allows one toisolate hormones and demonstrate causality between a hormone and a sex difference in a trait. Humans too can have their gonads surgically removed. For example, men castrated for prostatecancer do not have testes, and even larger numbers of womenexperience surgical menopause and do not have ovaries. The study of these populations with primary androgen and estrogen deciencies has been instrumental in understanding the role ofsex hormones in diabetes prevention in humans ( Appiah et al., 2014; Keating et al., 2006, 2010; Mauvais-Jarvis, 2016 ). The Origin of Sex Differences Sex differences in physiology begin during development fromthe combination of genetic and hormonal events and theycontinue after puberty. They result from the combination of three major events. The Cell-Autonomous Action of Sex ChromosomesAll biological sex differences originate with the differences in the number and type of sex chromosomes. One of the most impor- tant differences is that the mammalian testis-determining Sry gene on the Y chromosome causes the development of testes in males ( Arnold, 2017 ). In the absence of Sryin XX females, auto- somal or X-linked genes induce differentiation of ovaries. Thepresence versus absence of Sry, therefore, sets up a lifelong dif- ference in the levels of gonadal hormones, which are primary fac- tors that induce sex differences in many tissues. Because ovarianhormones occur together with XX sex chromosomes, and testic-ular hormones occur together with XY sex chromosomes, it has historically been difcult to separate the sex-biased effects of sex chromosomes from the effects of gonadal hormones.Although it is widely established that post-pubertal gonadal hormones effects on metabolic 2013; Navarro al., 2015 ) and that pre-pu-bertal effects of gonadal hormones program metabolism in adults (as discussed below), it is not generally appreciated that the sex chromosome complement itself (outside the testis-determining Srygene) contributes to metabolic differences between males and females ( Chen et al., 2012 ). Still, prior to the differentiation of gonads during development, male XY embryos of several species are larger ( Burgoyne et al., 1995, 2002 ) and grow faster (Avery et al., 1992; Pergament et al., 1994; Ray et al., 1995; Xu et al., 1992 ) than female XX embryos. This suggests that to fully understand metabolic differences between males and females, it is important to consider both the presence of female/male go-nads and the effects of XX versus XY chromosome complement outside of the Srygene ( Figure 1 ). The Testicular Testosterone differentiated two peri- natal testosterone surges that will masculinize the reproductive tract and the organization of neural circuits permissive to theactivation of male behavior at puberty. In male humans and pri-mates, the predominant testosterone surge occurs prenatally, during the second trimester of pregnancy ( Corbier et al., 1992; Forest et al., 1976 ). In male rodents, the rst testosterone surge occurs in late gestation and the second peaks at 2 hr postnatally and returns to basal levels at 6 hr ( Corbier et al., 1992; Weisz and Ward, 1980 ). However, rodent male levels of testosterone are higher than those of females from day 18 of gestation through day 5 post-partum ( Weisz and Ward, 1980 ). Extensive evidence relates sexually dimorphic aspects of physiology to brain mascu-linization by these testicular testosterone surges in al., 2004; Simerly, 2002 ). This sexual differentiation is referred to as the ''organizational'' action of testosterone as it causesthe hypothalamus to permanently change its structure and func- tion, leading to sex differences in reproductive behavior and physiology. This organizational effect is said to produce amasculinization if the acquired trait corresponds to a typical male behavior, like the masculinization of underlying neural cir- cuitry responsible for male behaviors such as ghting and urinemarking after puberty. It is called a defeminization if the acquired trait corresponds to the loss of a typical female behavior, like the loss of the pituitary ability to mount a pre-ovulatory surge of go-nadotropins. The hypothalamus, however, also controls energybalance after receiving signals for the main appetite-suppressing hormone, leptin, which acts in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) ( Elm- quist et al., 1999 ). In rodents, primates, and humans, the organi- zation and wiring of ARC neuron circuitry controlling energy balance also occurs during perinatal life ( Bouret et al., 2004; Grayson et al., 2006; Koutcherov et al., 2002 ). Thus, as in the case of the hypothalamic control of reproduction, the hypotha- lamic control of energy homeostasis is likely to be sexually dimorphic and to be programmed or masculinized by the sametesticular testosterone surge ( Figure 1 ). Gonadal Hormones after Puberty Most sex differences in glucose and energy homeostasis arebelieved to be the consequence of the ''activational'' (reversible)role of gonadal hormones acting on their receptors after the onset of puberty. Although these effects are reversible, they are the most potent proximate factors that make male and fe-male tissues different. Therefore, they contribute to sexual differ- entiation ( Arnold, 2017 ). Testosterone is the 1218 Cell Metabolism 25, June 6, 2017Cell Metabolism Perspectivehormone, and 17 b-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) are the main female gonadal hormones. The actions of these sex hor- mones on metabolic homeostasis in sexually mature malesand female animals have been extensively described in recentreviews and will not be discussed here ( Mauvais-Jarvis et al., 2013; Navarro et al., 2015 ).Figure 1 summarizes the causes of sex differences in physiology. Methods for the Study of Sex Differences in Preclinical Studies of MetabolismApart from sex-related reproductive behavior, reproductive traits, and sex-specic hormone-dependent cancers, most dis- eases differ in the two sexes. As discussed above, this is espe-cially true for animal models of metabolic diseases ( Mauvais-Jar- vis, 2015b ). Therefore, limiting studies to only one sex should require an explicit scientic justication in basic researchinvolving animals and cells with regard to metabolic homeosta-sis, diabetes, or obesity. Arguably, the rst question to ask is to what extent there is a sex difference in the trait of interest. If we take the example of laboratory rodents, the phenotypic sexdifference should be rst observed in adult male and female an- imals of the same reproductive age with intact gonads. It is important initially to ascertain that the sex difference is presentunder normal laboratory conditions. Because of the importance of the perinatal nutritional environment in programming the pro- jection of hypothalamic circuits regulating energy homeostasis inlaboratory rodents ( Coupe and Bouret, 2013 ), it is also critical that male and female animals studied be littermates in order to be comparable. The use of rodents of the same genetic back- ground but bred in different sites and environments can intro-duce phenotypic differences in offspring that are unrelated to sex ( Ussar et al., 2015 ). Another important parameter is the num- ber of animals per cage, to compare males and females at thesame housing density to avoid nutritional confounding factors. Indeed, because of their aggressive behavior, males are usually separated from one another, resulting in lower numbers percage, which may affect their food intake, locomotor activity, and energy expenditure ( Ritz et al., 2014 ). In fact, rearing rodents in small litters favors nutritionally induced obesity compared tolarger litters ( Kennedy, 1957 ). Once all of these important param- eters are controlled, several approaches can be used to nd the variables that differentially influence the trait in the two sexes. The Role of Gonadal Hormones after PubertyThe powerful effects of sex hormones make them the top choice of factors that cause sex differences in metabolism after puberty. As discussed previously, multiple rodent models of Figure 1. Origins of Sex Differences Sex differences in physiology begin during development from the combination of genetic and hormonal events and they continue after puberty. They res ult from the combination of the cell-autonomous effect of sex chromosomes, the organizational action (masculinization) of the testicular testosterone sur ge in males, and the activational effect of male and females sex hormones acting on their receptors after puberty. T, testosterone; AR, androgen receptor; ER, estrog en receptor; GPER, G-protein-coupled Cell Metabolism 25, June 6, 2017 1219Cell Metabolism Perspectivemetabolic diseases show a male predominance. One important question is to what extent this is due to E2 action in females or to testosterone action in males? This question can be rst ad- dressed by performing ovariectomy (OVX) in females to sup-press ovarian secretions, including E2 and P4, and orchidec- tomy in males determine the impact of testicular secretion of testosterone ( Figure 3 ). Importantly, surgery causes pro- longed alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis,and therefore influences stress hormones (reviewed in Becker et al., 2005 ). Therefore, if gonadectomy is performed, the control group should undergo sham surgery (without gonadectomy). Totake the example of the role of E2, if OVX in females abolishes the sex difference in a particular trait (and makes the female like the male), then E2 replacement therapy, with doses leadingto physiological concentrations, should be performed to deter- mine whether E2 restores the phenotype of the intact female. This experiment is usually performed in a three group design:gonad-intact controls, OVX with vehicle replacement, andOVX with E2 replacement ( Figure 2 ). If E2 restores the pheno- type to the level of controls, this supports the concept that E2 contributes to the sex difference in the trait. Depending onwhether the sexually dimorphic phenotype is acute or chronic and the length of the desired replacement, several methods of E2 replacement therapy can be used. These include daily sub-cutaneous (S.C.) injection of E2 in oil ( Wong et al., 2010 ), S.C. implantation of commercially available pellets containing E2 (Kim et al., 2014; Le May et al., 2006 ), S.C. implantation of Silastic tubes lled with limitations, and serum E2 concentrations achieved foreach method have been reviewed ( Becker et al., 2005; Ingberg et al., 2012 ). Once the role of E2 is ascertained, it may be impor- tant to determine which estrogen receptor (ER) mediates the effect. One method is to use commercially available selectiveagonists for ER a(PPT) ( Stauffer et al., 2000 ), ERb(DPN) ( 2001 ), (G1) ( Bologa et al., 2006 ), which can be administered in OVX mice as described for E2.The results of the pharmacological manipulation are then conrmed by genetic elimination of the target ER in female mice with knockout of these receptors globally and in a tis-sue-specic manner ( Figure 2 ). An in-depth discussion of these models is beyond the scope of this Perspective, except for a few considerations. First, global knockout of gene function from inception can cause developmental defects, and these can beavoided by the use of conditional gene deletion systems. The choice of specic gene deletion conditions is important; how- ever, as for example, the use of tamoxifen as an inducer ofCre recombinase could confound results due to the activity of tamoxifen as an ER antagonist. Finally, recent studies have re- vealed that sex differences in energy homeostasis could involveE2 recruitment of specic brain regions and neuronal cell types (Correa et al., 2015; Mart \u00b4nez de Morentin et al., 2014; Saito et al., 2016 ). Therefore, in the future, neural circuit-based ap- proaches need to be integrated in the framework of studyingof sex differences in metabolism. Evidence that estrogens make females different from males does not necessarily imply that testicular secretions of malesare not also important contributions to sex differences. For example, if gonadectomy makes the female similar to thegonad-intact male, testicular androgens might still influence the trait. A course of studies, similar to those outlined for estro- gens in the last paragraph, would then be used to investigate the role of androgens acting in adulthood. These experimentslay the foundation for mechanistic studies to determine the cell types that are directly influenced by these hormones, and the molecular pathways that they influence.Role of Perinatal Masculinization by TesticularTestosterone If a sex difference is present before puberty or is not altered by gonadectomy, it can result from sexual differentiation by thepre- or postnatal testicular testosterone surge in males ( 1 and 3). These ''organizational'' effects of testosterone can be studied by perinatal hormonal manipulations. As earlyas 1936, it was reported that neonatal castration in male rats re- produces the female potential for ovulation when male rats are transplanted with ovaries ( Pfeiffer, 1936 ). Similarly, transplanting neonatal rat testes into a female ( Harris, 1964 ) or injecting testos- terone on the day of birth ( Barraclough, 1961 ) produced a permanent failure of ovulation and luteinization in the adult (masculinization). In multiple subsequent studies of sexual differ-entiation of the male brain, investigators have used the model of transient prenatal or neonatal exposure to exogenous testos- terone in female rodents to show that testosterone defeminizes and masculinizes the structure and function of Arnold and al., 2008; Simerly,2002; Wu et al., 2009 ). Because the process of sexual differentiation of the brain and body is a widespread series of developmental events with func-tional signicance for diverse behavioral and physiologicalresponses, this model can also be used to assess the role of testicular testosterone in programming the sex differences in en- ergy and glucose homeostasis that will remain in adults. To studythe effect of testosterone in programming metabolism in female animals as a model of developmental masculinization, investiga- tors have used both prenatal testosterone postnatal testosterone al., al., 2011, 2013a, 2013b ). It should be emphasized, however, that the development of adipose tissueand hypothalamic neurons controlling metabolism occur at somewhat different times in primates and rodents. In primates, including humans, development of adipose tissue and synapto-genesis of hypothalamic neurons controlling energy balance oc- curs during the second trimester of pregnancy ( Ailhaud et al., 1992; Gesta et al., 2007; Koutcherov et al., 2002 ). In mice and rats, developmental plasticity of hypothalamic circuits controlling energy balance and peripheral adipose tissue development occur during the rst 2 weeks of neonatal life ( Ailhaud et al., 1992; Bouret et al., 2004; Gesta et al., 2007 ). Therefore, with regard to sexual differentiation of the hypothalamus and develop- ment of adipose tissue, the mouse rst week of neonatal lifeparallels human fetal development during the second trimesterof pregnancy ( Mauvais-Jarvis, 2014 ). This later window of neonatal developmental plasticity in the mouse provides an experimental advantage that allows manipulation of the neonatalsex steroid milieu in the presence or absence of androgen recep- tor (AR) or/and estrogen receptors (ERs). However, to actually 1220 Cell Metabolism 25, June 6, 2017Cell Metabolism Perspectiveassess the masculinization, unexposed male littermates must be used as controls of androgenized females. Thus, neonatally an-drogenized female rodents develop several metabolic alterations consistent with masculinization. They exhibit masculinization of lean tissue mass including heart and skeletal muscle, kidney,and bone ( as well as serum adiponectin set point in females to an extent similar to that observed in littermate males ( Nohara system by decreasing the expression of POMC and the intensity of neuronal projections from POMC neurons Figure 2. Mouse Models to Study the Sole of Gonadal Hormones (A) A sex-biased trait is hypothesized to be due to E2 action in females. (B) This question is addressed by performing ovariectomy (OVX) in females to suppress ovarian E2 in a three group design: gonad-intact sham operated controls, OVX with vehicle treatment,and OVX with E2 replacement. If OVX abolishes the sex difference in the trait (and makes the female like the male), then E2 replacement therapy shouldbe performed to ascertain that E2 restores the phenotype of the intact female, supporting the concept that E2 contributes to the sex difference in the trait. (C) To determine which estrogen receptor (ER)mediates E2 effect, one can use selective ER a (PPT), ER b(DPN), or the G-protein-coupled ER (G1) agonists in OVX mice followed by mice witha knockout of the target ER, globally and in a tissue-specic manner. within the ARC, which is associated with increased food intake in females as in litter-mate males ( Nohara et al., 2011 ). There are signicant limitations to this model to study the sexual differentiation of energy homeo-stasis. First, the injection of testosterone in female rodent neonates is only an approx- imate model for masculinization in malesbecause the dose and timing of testos-terone injection do not reproduce the actual physiological testosterone surge of males. Second, using androgen treatmentof females as a model for normal masculin- ization of the males has the potential prob- lem that the sex chromosomes are notequivalent. Indeed, neonatally androgen- ized males have a different their androgenized female littermates(Nohara et al., 2013a ). This suggests that interactions between perinatal testos- terone and complements of sex-linked genes in sex differentiation of metabolichomeostasis. Finally, although some traits of metabolic programming by testosterone in females are typical of masculinization,others inconsistent with tion ( Mauvais-Jarvis, 2014 ). locally converted to 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the most potent ligand of the androgen receptor (AR), or 17 b-estradiol (E2), which acts on es- trogen receptors (ERs). For example in rodents, testosterone istransformed to E2 in the brain, where it acts on ERs to causemost of the masculinization in neural structure and behavior (Arnold and Gorski, 1984; MacLusky and Naftolin, 1981; Morris et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2009 ). To address the role of testosterone metabolites, four groups may be used, including rodents neona- tally injected with vehicle, testosterone, DHT, and E2. Using this experimental design in female mice, a study reported thatthe sexual differentiation of energy homeostasis involves an Cell Metabolism 25, June 6, 2017 1221Cell Metabolism PerspectiveAR-dependent masculinization of hypothalamic POMC neurons and in energy intake ( Nohara et al., 2011 ). The use of neonatal castration to study the effect of the neonatal testosterone surge in programming sex differencesin adult males is complicated by the confounding effect of the loss of testosterone in adult males ( Navarro et al., 2015 ). However, the transient neonatal S.C. injection of male pupswith flutamide (AR antagonist) or tamoxifen (ER antagonist) to block the effect of the testosterone surge can be used to study the effect of AR or ER in programming sexual differ-ences in metabolic homeostasis in adults. The study of molec- ular and cellular mechanisms of AR and ER programing of physiology are beyond the scope of this Perspective butinclude effects of hormones on cell number (apoptosis),neuronal connectivity, synaptogenesis, and axonal guidance (Simerly, 2002 ). The evidence presented above suggests that the perinatal testosterone surge in males masculinizes the hypothalamus and the peripheral tissues in a way that permanently programs sex differences in metabolic homeostasis in adults. A major lim-itation in this area, however, is the absence of modern tools to manipulate the testosterone surge in males during the perinatal window, without relying on the neonatal castration in males ortestosterone injection in females. Is the Sex Difference due to the Effects of Sex Chromosomes?As described above, male-female differences that remain afterremoval of the gonads may represent long-lasting (organiza- tional) effects of gonadal hormones during development, or ge- netic effects of XX versus XY sex chromosome complementthat act independently of gonadal hormones ( Figures 1 and 3). To tease apart the determinants of sex differences in meta- bolism, it is valuable to break sex into its component parts ofgonadal (male versus female) and genetic (XX versus XY) effects using experimental models. A mouse model that is valuable to distinguish the effects of go- nads from sex chromosomes is the Four Core Genotypes (FCG)mouse model ( Arnold and Chen, 2009; Burgoyne and Arnold, 2016 ). This model is available on a C57BL/6 inbred background, making results comparable to many of the models used in meta-bolic studies. In this model, the Srygene that determines male gonad development has been de-coupled from the Y chromo- some and transplanted as a transgene onto an autosome. Pre-natal and adult androgen levels appear not to differ in XX and XY male mice that possess the autosomal Sry (Itoh et al., 2015; Burgoyne and Arnold, 2016 ). With the FCG model, it is possible to develop mice with 4 combinations of gonads-sexchromosomes: XX mice with female gonads, XY mice with male gonads, XX mice with male gonads, and XY mice with fe- male gonads ( Figure 4 A). The FCG model has been applied to identify sex chromosome complement influence on metabolic traits such as obesity, food intake, hyperlipidemia, and hyperten- sion ( Bonthuis and Rissman, al., 2012, 2015; Ji et al., 2010; Link et al., 2015 ). Using obesity as an example, in FCG mice that were gonadectomized as adults to remove the acute effects of gonadal hormones, mice with XX chromosomeshad greater body weight and adiposity than XY mice on both a chow and a high-fat diet, regardless of the original gonadal type or presence of the Srygene ( Figure 4 A;Chen et al., 2012 ). The enhanced weight gain in XX mice was associated withincreased food intake in XX mice during the light period of the diurnal cycle ( Chen et al., 2012, 2015 ). If studies using the Four Core Genotypes model reveal differences between XX and XY mice, the role of X and Y chro- mosomes may be explored further using additional models (Burgoyne and Arnold, 2016 ). One of these models is the XY* Figure 3. Decision Tree to Study Sex Differences Diagram showing steps to investigate the sex- biased factors that cause a sex difference in animals. Investigators start by comparing the phenotype of the two sexes, keeping environ- mental conditions similar, which reveals a sex difference in a trait. The next step is to vary levelsof gonadal hormones in adulthood at the time of testing using gonadectomy and replacement of hormones, to determine whether gonadal hor-mones explain the sex difference. If these manip- ulations show an effect, the investigators then determines the hormone receptor that mediates the effect, and the downstream molecular path- ways causing the phenotypic sex difference. Ifsuch ''activational'' effects of hormones do not completely explain the effect, then the investi- gator may test for ''organizational'' effects ofperinatal testosterone. This is done by interfering with testosterone actions or exposing females to testosterone at that period of life. If the investigatornds an effect of hormone perinatally, which cau- ses a sex difference later in life, the nding leads to identication of the receptors involved, their sites of action, and downstream molecular mecha- nisms. If both of these types of manipulationsof gonadal hormones do not completely explain the sex difference, then the investigator may test whether the effect of sex chromosomes in spe- cic mouse models are appropriate (Four Core Genotypes and XY*). Even if there is no sex difference in the overt phenotype, there may exist sex differences in underlying mechanisms, which cancel each other out. This gure is adapted from Becker et al. (2005) . 1222 Cell Metabolism 25, June 6, 2017Cell Metabolism Perspectivemouse model. In the XY* model, the Y chromosome (Y*) has a normal Srygene but differs from wild-type Y chromosomes in having a duplication in a portion of the pseudoautosomal region (Burgoyne et al., 1998; Eicher et al., 1991 ). This duplication al- lows pairing with the X chromosome pseudoautosomal region Figure 4. Mouse Models to Study the Role of X and Y Chromosomes (A) Left: the Four Core Genotypes model distin- guishes effects that correlate with XX versus XY sex chromosome complement from effects that differ based on male versus female gonads. Right: body weight gain on a high-fat diet is accelerated in XX compared to XY mice that were gonadec-tomized as adults. From Chen et al. (2012) . (B) Left: after the identication of differences between XX and XY mice, the XY* model is usedto investigate the contribution of X versus Y chromosome copy number. Right: gonads were removed from adult mice (time 0) and 4 weeks later the body weights converged, followed by increased weight gain in mice with two X chro-mosomes (XX and XXY) compared to those with one X chromosome (XO and XY). The presence of the Y chromosome does not affect body weightgain. From Chen et al. (2012) . (C) Left: the Sex Chromosome Trisomy model assesses differences related to one or twoX chromosomes with a Y chromosome and different gonadal combinations. Right: animals were examined with either intact gonads or after gonadectomy (GDX) and delivery of testosterone (T) to normalize levels across genotypes. In bothconditions, presence of two X chromosomes led to increased percent body fat compared to a single X chromosome. From Chen et al. (2013) . (D) FCG studies lend themselves to analysis by two-way ANOVA, with gonadal sex and sex chromosomes as main effects. These analyses can reveal (left) a main effect of gonadal sex, (middle) a main effect of chromosomal sex, or(right) an interaction between gonadal and chro- mosomal sex. in unusual ways during meiosis, leading to generation of sex chromosome com- plements that are nearly equivalent toXX, XY, XO, and XX ( Figure 4 B;Eicher et al., 1991; Burgoyne et al., 1998 ). (It should be noted that in the XY* model,XO mice also possess a small secondchromosome that is nearly equivalent to a normal pseudoautosomal region and that XXY mice possess a hybrid chromo-some that contains X and Y* genetic ma- terial on a single chromosome [ Burgoyne and Arnold, 2016 ].) A comparison of traits in these genotypes parses the effects of two doses of the X chromosome (XX and XXY) versus one dose of X (XY andXO), and the presence (XY and XXY) versus absence (XO and XX) of Y chromo- some genes. When C57BL/6 XY* micewere gonadectomized as adults, bodyweight segregated into two groups, with mice having two doses of the X chromo- some (XX and XXY) gaining more weight and fat mass thanmice with a single X dose (XO and XY) ( Figure 4 B;Chen et al., 2012 ). The presence of the Y chromosome had no effect. Thus, the genetic determinant of higher body weight is twocopies of the X chromosome. Cell Metabolism 25, June 6, 2017 1223Cell Metabolism PerspectiveAdditional conrmation of the effects of sex chromosome dosage can be obtained with models such as the Sex Chromo- some Trisomy model ( Chen et al., 2013 ). This model allows the generation of eight genotypes: XX, XY, XXY, and XYY mice,each with either male or female gonads ( Chen et al., 2013; Park et al., 2008 ). One use of this model is to emulate the XXY male genotype that occurs in Klinefelter syndrome, which hasbeen associated with abdominal obesity, increased rates oftype 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome ( Bojesen et al., 2010; Jiang-Feng et al., 2012 ). The Trisomy model can be used to determine what role sex chromosome and hormone levelseach play in determining metabolic traits (similar to the FCG model), and also whether number or dose of X and Y chromo- somes has an effect when examined on the background ofboth female and male gonads. One drawback to this model is that the genotypes are not all robust on an inbred background, and studies are therefore performed on the outbred MF1 strainbackground. Nevertheless, in studies of body weight andadiposity, results with this model extended those observed in FCG and XY* mice. Two doses of the X chromosome led to higher body weight and adiposity than a single X chromosomedose, regardless of male or female gonads, and independent of testosterone levels ( Figure 4 C;Chen et al., 2013 ). Once it is established that there is a sex chromosomal effect on a metabolic trait of interest, subsequent steps will depend on the sex chromosome involved. In the example shown in Figure 4 , there is a consistent effect of X chromosome dose as a determinant of differences in body weight, weight gain on a high-fat diet, and proportional fat mass. The X chromosome is special in that dosage is normalized between XX and XY cellsfor a majority of X genes through the process of X chromosomeinactivation during development. This suggests that most genes on the X chromosome are unlikely to contribute to the effects of X chromosome dosage on sex differences and focuses attentiononto specic subsets of X chromosome genes. Possible candi- dates include genes that escape inactivation and remain tran- scriptionally active on the ''inactive'' X chromosome, as well aspaternally imprinted genes on the X chromosome ( Balaton and Brown, 2016; Lee and Bartolomei, 2013 ). In both cases, dosage of these specic genes would be higher in XX (and XXY)compared to XY (and XO) tissues and could influence metabolicphenotypes. Indeed, a handful of X chromosome escapee genes have been shown to exhibit 40%-60% higher expression levels in key metabolic tissues (liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle) ofXX compared to XY mice ( Chen et al., 2012; Link et al., 2015 ). On the other hand, if Y dosage influences a trait, key candidates for the effect are narrowed to a small number of Y chromosomegenes that are expressed in the tissue of interest. To date, studies of sex chromosome effects have not been widely explored but represent fertile ground for future elucidation ofsex differences in metabolic traits. Statistical Considerations for the Analyses of Sex DifferencesAs described in preceding sections, mouse models allow theidentication of the components of sex that determine a specic trait. These may include gonadal sex, sex chromosome comple- ment, acute effects or organizational effects of gonadal hor-mones, and interactions between these components. To identify the contribution of the various components, it is critical to designand analyze experiments with appropriate statistical consider- ations. A useful paradigm is illustrated by studies performed with the FCG model, where the study of four genotypes (XX and XY mice with male gonads and XX and XY mice with femalegonads) lends itself to a 2 32 comparison via two-way ANOVA (Arnold and Chen, 2009; Burgoyne and Arnold, 2016; Chen et al., 2012, 2015; Link et al., 2015, 2017; Reue, 2017 ). If analysis of the four genotypes by ANOVA reveals that mice with male gonads(XX and XY) differ from mice with female gonads (XX and XY), the cause is gonadal sex (or more precisely, the presence versus absence of the Srygene) ( Figure 4 D). On the other hand, if a trait is influenced by sex chromosome complement, differences will be observed between XX and XY mice ( Figure 4 ). The power to detect main effects of gonadal and chromosomal sex in a two-way ANOVA is aided by the fact that two groups are combined for each analysis. For example, in a study with ve mice of each of the four genotypes, the comparison of mice with maleversus female gonads would actually be a comparison of tenmice with male and ten mice with female gonads. In addition to the main effects, analysis of FCG studies via two-way ANOVA allows detection of interactions betweengonadal sex and sex chromosome genotype. An interaction is evident when an effect occurs between two groups only when another condition is also satised. An example would be whenthe trait studied in mice with male gonads has a greater value than in mice with female gonads, but only in the context of XX chromosomes ( Figure 4 D). A larger group size may be required to evaluate interactions and would depend on the effect size. To assess the acute effects of gonadal hormones versus the organizational effects of gonadal hormones, comparisons wouldbe made between mice with and without gonadectomy viatwo-way ANOVA and with the same considerations dis- cussed above. Important Considerations for the Study of Sex Differences in Preclinical Studies of MetabolismImpact of the Estrous Cycle In gonadally intact rodents, it has been suggested that males be compared to females on 2 specic days of their estrous cycle,which represent two ends of the continuum of hormone levels(Becker et al., 2005 ). It is possible that metabolic traits such as food intake, thermogenesis, and locomotor activity may differ as a function of the day of the female reproductive cycle becausethese traits change by rapid alterations in neuronal ring, neuro- peptide secretion, and autonomic nervous activation. However, for other metabolic traits, the estrous cycle may be less relevantbecause these traits are the consequence of hormone-induced chronic alterations in gene and protein expression, leading to progressive modication of tissue function (e.g., adipose tissue mass, lipid biology, insulin sensitivity, or islet biology). In fact, a meta-analysis comparison of male and female mice, with no re- gard to the stage of the estrous cycle, established that variabilityin most traits was equivalent in females and males and that formost end points, it was unnecessary to stage the estrous cycle (Prendergast et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, female rats can synchronize their estrous cycles if housed together as a result of chemosignals from pheromones (McClintock, 1984 ). However, if female mice are housed together at high density (5-6 per cage), which promotes stress, cycling is 1224 Cell Metabolism 25, June 6, 2017Cell Metabolism Perspectivesuppressed compared to mice housed at lower density (2 per cage) because of adrenal-mediated urinary metabolites ( ). Therefore, housing at optimal density seems appropriate.Impact of the Vivarium Environment in Rodents The abundance of exogenous sources of estrogens coming from normal rodent chow (soy phytoestrogens), rodent bedding (corn-cob), or cages and water bottles (Bisphenol-A) could affect es-trogen-sensitive metabolic parameters in a sexually dimorphic ( Thigpen et al., 2013 ). A non-soy low-phytoestrogen chow fetal serum E2 concentration resulting in a ''fetalestrogenization syndrome'' with obesity and hyperleptinemia in adults mice of both sexes compared to soy-based high-phyto- estrogen chow. However, only males developed glucose intoler-ance on the non-soy chow, thus creating a diet-induced sex difference compared to mice on the soy-based chow ( Ruhlen et al., 2008 ). Perhaps the most critical challenge created by the environ- ment in confounding the exploration of sex differences in biolog- ical traits, is the influence of the metagenome\u2014the interaction between host and microbiome genes\u2014on the experimentalreproducibility of in vivo studies in rodents. Light/dark cycle schedules, type of rodent diet, pH and sterility of water, and dened vivarium pathogens all influence the metagenome inways that can modify the phenotype of rodents. For example, the development of autoimmune type 1 diabetes in mice is char- acterized by a female predominance under standard vivariumconditions. However, under germ-free conditions, the incidence of T1D in males become similar to that of females, suggesting that in this model the sex bias is microbiome dependent ( Markle et al., 2013 ). The scope of metagenomic effects in rodent pheno- types and the principles to address them were recently dened (Stappenbeck and Virgin, 2016 ). However, the most important paradigm is certainly the direct comparison of littermate progenyof heterozygote matings that segregate alleles but maintain the same microbiome components. Impact of Stress in RodentsThere are sex differences in the responses to acute stress in ro- dents that are mediated by different hormonal systems, with males being responsive to glucocorticoid increase and femalesmore responsive to alterations of estrous cycle ( Shors et al., 2001; Wood et al., 2001 ). Interestingly, the sex of the investigator is also a biological variable that needs to be seriously considered. A study of student volunteers reported that the sex of the investi-gator is associated with differences in pain responses. Thus, sub- jects tolerated pain better when tested by an experimenter of the opposite sex ( Ka\u00b4llai et al., 2004 ). In addition, higher pain intensity was observed for subjects tested by female experimenters. These effects seem to occur in animals, but they are believed to occur and to be related not to competition or beliefs, as in humans,but to odors, sounds, and handling differences. For instance, exposure of mice and rats to male investigators induced a robust physiological stress response that resulted in stress-inducedanalgesia compared to exposure to female investigators ( Sorge et al., 2014 ). So, in both humans and rodents, male sex of the investigator is associated with better tolerance to stress. Assessment of Sex Differences in Cell CultureThe NIH has mandated researchers to consider sex as a bio- logical variable in preclinical research to promote the studyof cells from both sexes. Phenol red, a common pH indicator used in cell culture, is estrogenic. Accordingly, it is important to avoid its use when studying parameters that might be influ- enced by the presence of estrogens. Phenol red-free mediaare available. Charcoal-stripped serum is also used to avoid steroid hormones present in serum. When sex steroids are added, physiological concentrations of hormones (E2, T,DHT, and P4) should be used, usually between 1-10 nM.The use of pharmacological concentrations over 100 nM risks nding effects that are not relevant to physiology. In addition, cells or cultured tissues isolated from ER and AR knockoutmice should be cultured in the presence and absence of the ligand to validate the ligand-dependent and ligand-indepen- dent effect of the receptor deletion on the phenotype. Forexample, mice with global or b-cell-specic knockout of the AR exhibit a similar defect in glucose-stimulated insulin secre- tion compared to littermate controls ( al., 2016; Nav- arro et al., 2016 ). However, in cultured islets from these same mice, the insulin secretory defect is observed only when the control and AR-decient islets are studied in the presence of physiological concentrations of testosterone ( Navarro et al., 2016 ), not when the islets are cultured in absence of hormone (Dubois et al., 2016 ). The major issue in studying sex differences in cultured cells is that the available research tools are lagging far behind. First, there are no genetically identical male and female cell lines avail- able to date to study sex differences in vitro. Moreover, theprospect of establishing genetically comparable, immortalized cell lines from male and female humans is dim ( Ritz et al., 2014; Shah et al., 2014 ). The use of primary cell cultures from inbred animals of the same genetic background is limited bythe availability of tissue and, most importantly, the impossibility to expand them. The development of clonal, immortalized cell lines from littermate inbred animals is not perfect but seems alogical rst step in creating comparable male and female cell lines. Second, even if cells from both sexes were available, the com- parison of cultured male and female cells oversimplies the question of sex because of the limitations of the in vitro environ- ment. Although XX and XY cells differ because of cell-autono-mous factors, the sex of cells in vivo is more complicated(Wiseman and Pardue, 2001 ). Sex differences are dynamic and changeable properties of the body influenced by genetic sex, the organizational role of testosterone surge, and the activationalrole of sex hormones at puberty. The resulting in vivo environ- ments differ in multiple factors including hormones, metabolites, neural inputs, and body composition and dene two differentmale and female biological systems for cells in vivo ( Figure 5 ). For example, proling of sex differences in serum metabolites re- vealed major sex differences in concentrations for over threequarters of the metabolites studied ( Mittelstrass et al., 2011 ). This ''sexome,'' which is the sum of all sex-specic influences on cellular systems ( Arnold and Lusis, 2012 ), produces pheno- typic sex differences that are exclusive to the in vivo environ-ment. Therefore, we need to study the systems biology of each sex globally in order to have an appreciation of the sex-specic aggregate behavior of cells ( Figure 5 ). When primary cells are isolated from the in vivo environment and cultured, the sex differ- ences in the cells phenotype can come from sex chromosome Cell Metabolism 25, June 6, 2017 1225Cell Metabolism Perspectiveeffects or be caused by transient (e.g., gonadal hormone levels modifying gene expression) or permanent (epigenetic modica- tions induced by perinatal testosterone) sex differences present in the cells' environments prior to harvest, which is carried overinto the dish. To add to the complexity of cell culture, when cells are immortalized they become chromosomally unstable after multiple passages. In the ATCC collection, over a hundredmale cell lines have lost their Y chromosome ( Park et al., 2006; Shah et al., 2014 ). Conclusion and Future Directions The study of animals and cells of both sexes is essential to cata- lyze scientic discoveries that will open avenues for sex-basedtreatments of metabolic disease. Several obstacles currentlyhinder progress in the eld and should be addressed. First, the science of sex differences in biology and disease is more com- plex and sophisticated than the research tools that are availableto study it. This is particularly apparent for the study of develop- mental programming of sex differences and the availability of comparable cell lines from both sexes. Novel research tools inthis area are urgently needed. Second, and most importantly, the potential for innovative research in this area requires signi- cant efforts to improve familiarity with sex differences researchamong investigators as well as grant and manuscript reviewers. It is currently stylish to demand that high impact science address ''mechanisms,'' and studies of sex differences have beenlabeled by some as ''descriptive.'' Our perspective is that sex dif-ferences are at the core of the mechanism for biological traits and disease, and that failure to understand both sexes is also a failure to fully understand the mechanisms of interest. Webelieve that the incorporation of appropriately designed studies on sex differences in metabolism and other elds will accelerate discovery and enhance our ability to treat disease.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (DK074970, DK107444), the American Diabetes Association (7-13-BS-101),and the Price Goldsmith-Endowed Chair at Tulane University Health Sciences Center to F.M.J.
