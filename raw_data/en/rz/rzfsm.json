The purpose of the current research work is to identify the critical performance factors (criteria) and their co-factors (sub-criteria) that are responsible for the performance measurement of CSC and suggest the best possible solutions (alternatives) to improve the same. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the objective of the research, a hierarchical model has been developed and analyzed using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-Fuzzy TOPSIS as a hybrid approach to obtain the severity weights of the identified criteria and prioritization toward their relative importance for the best possible alternatives. Findings Analysis reveals that the criteria \"energy consumption\" comes out to be the most critical criteria, and alternative \"application of passive cold devices\" is the most effective solution for improving the performance of CSC. Higher energy consumption leads to a higher rate of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increasing the global warming phenomenon, high operational cost and degradation of natural energy resources. The Application of Passive Cold Devices (PCDs) utilizes solar energy to operate the refrigeration units reducing the energy consumption, environmental and operating cost of CSC. Research limitations/implications The research work provides several insights into the critical issues related to the CSC and suggests significant findings that enable the management and decision-makers to adopt these practices for performance evaluation and improvement of the same. The key findings of the work, such as \"application of passive cold devices\" and \"application of IoT in cold chain logistics\", facilitate an improved platform to improve the CSC performance and proposed several directions that will enhance the merit of future research. Originality/value The presented study consolidates the various perspectives associated with CSC performance, explores the most critical criteria and proposes the best suitable cold chain practices for organizational growth. The work also provides an analytical analysis with the essence of practicalities and sensitivity analysis to support the robustness of the results. By enriching the literature and quantitative analysis of the new proposed model, this paper forms vast managerial and research implications in the field of CSC.
