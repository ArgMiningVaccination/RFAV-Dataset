CALLAHAN2 Introduction Notions of self care and self management of common, but serious, health conditions were once viewed with skepti-cism by clinicians. However, over time, enlightened health care professionals have come to embrace the idea of in- formed, participative collaboration with patients as a keystrategy for enhancing the effectiveness of clinical diag-nostic and therapeutic interventions (1). Although theseideas are being absorbed into mainstream contemporary medicine and health care, our understanding of the range of self-initiated actions consumers use and the factors re-lated to use of these actions is inadequate. Sobel (2) suggests that self care is the \"hidden\" health care system and that self care, rather than primary, sec- ondary, or tertiary care, comprises the majority of healthcare. Others suggest that self-management activities aredeterminants of well being, potentially intervening be-tween health status and health outcomes (3-5). If these assertions are true, we must have a clear understanding of the factors related to and outcomes associated with strat-egy use so people with chronic conditions can be guidedin effective self-management practices. The terms self management and self care, often used interchangeably among lay and professional persons, are broadly dened as the activities people engage in to pro-mote health and/or manage chronic conditions (6 -9).These activities are usually self initiated and often under- taken with little to no supervision from health care pro-fessionals. For this article we use both phrases (self care and self management) to refer to the wide range of activi- ties people use to promote personal health and to detect,prevent, and treat common health problems. The use of self-initiated actions to manage arthritis con- ditions is well recognized in the scientic literature and among health care providers. Applying the above deni- tion of self management to arthritis, a variety of strategiescould be used to manage the symptoms and consequencesof the disease, such as taking medication, exercising, wear-ing splints or braces, taking herbs or supplements, or seek- ing care from alternative care providers. Two review arti- cles by Ernst (10,11) show that use of complementary andalternative strategies is common but variable among peo-ple with rheumatic disease, with most people using at least 1 type of complementary therapy (e.g., special diets, jewelry, vitamins, herbs, prayer, relaxation, or massage).Little is known, however, about the broad range of strate-gies that could be used to manage arthritis, the degree towhich people with arthritis use various strategies, and factors related to use of specic strategies. The purpose of this article is to address these gaps in the scientic litera-ture. Methods The Medline database was used to identify studies thatmet the following criteria: 1) study participants were froma rheumatology clinical practice or were community- dwelling adults who reported arthritis, rheumatoid arthri- tis (RA), osteoarthritis, or chronic musculoskeletal jointproblems; 2) specic self-management strategy use or cat-egories were assessed (e.g., heat, lotions, exercise, rest,dietary practices, herbs and supplements, or alternative care provider); and 3) frequency of use and/or sociodemo- graphic or clinical disease-related correlates of strategy usewere reported. Sociodemographic factors included age,sex, marital status, educational attainment, ethnicity, andincome or social status; disease-related factors included functional status, pain, disease severity (e.g., joint involve- ment or number of symptoms), disease duration, and co-morbidity.Supported by the National Institute on Arthritis and Mus- culoskeletal Disease Grant 5-P60-AR30701-18, a NationalInstitute on Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Disease Predoc-toral Grant, an Arthritis Foundation Dissertation Award,University of North Carolina Center on Aging Pilot Grant,and Postdoctoral Fellowship Award from NIDRR, US De-partment of Education Grant #H133B990005. 1Julie J.

Submitted for publication July 19, 2001; accepted in re- vised form January 6, 2003.Arthritis & Rheumatism (Arthritis Care & Research) Vol. 49, No. 5, October 15, 2003, pp 724 -731DOI 10.1002/art.11369\u00a9 2003, American College of Rheumatology REVIEW 724The search was limited to articles published in English between 1980 and January 2002. The terms, \"self-care\" or\"self-management\" were combined into 1 search strategy and the terms \"arthritis,\" \"rheumatoid arthritis,\" \"osteoar- thritis,\" or \"musculoskeletal\" were combined into anothersearch strategy. The 2 search strategies then were com-bined to capture self-management practices among per-sons with chronic arthritis and musculoskeletal problems. Additional searches were performed for the terms \"com- plementary or alternative medicine,\" \"joint protection,\" or\"adaptive the arthritis and musculoskeletal terms specied above. The bibliogra-phies of articles thus identied were scanned for further relevant publications. Studies examining self-management strategy use specically for bromyalgia and systemic lu-pus erythematosus were excluded because these condi-tions usually do not manifest with chronic joint problems. Study design, ascertainment and frequency of strategy use, and sociodemographic and clinical disease-relatedcorrelates of strategy use were assessed for each study thatmet inclusion criteria. Frequency of strategy use was re-ported as \"recent use\" (i.e., strategy used within the past 6 months) and \"ever use\" (i.e., use within the past year or in previous years). Demographic and disease-related corre-lates of strategy use were summarized by reporting signif-icant associations ( P/H113490.05). To further structure our review, frameworks described by DeFriese et al (7) and Norburn et al (12) were adopted.Seven broad categories representing different types of ar-thritis self-management strategies were identied: 1) topi- cal treatments (e.g., lotions, ointments, oils, heat, andcold), 2) activity-related strategies (e.g., exercise, activitymodication, assistive device use, joint protection behav- iors, or environmental changes), 3) dietary practices (e.g., eating or avoiding special foods, taking supplements orherbs, drinking or avoiding alcohol), 4) mind-body prac-tices (e.g., relaxation, prayer, talking with others, positivethinking, and meditation), 5) alternative and complemen- tary practitioners (ACPs; e.g., chiropractors, acupunctur- ists, or massage therapists), 6) home remedies (e.g., house-hold oils such as WD-40, motor oil, snake venom, beesting, or special jewelry), and 7) conventional medical care(e.g., prescribed and over-the-counter medications or use of health care services). Results Nineteen studies met inclusion criteria (Table 1), all were cross-sectional (4,13-31). All but 1 study used self-reportsurveys to ascertain strategy use; 1 study used self-report diaries and surveys to ascertain strategy use (31). Frequency of strategy use. Special dietary practices and use of herbs and supplements were most frequently exam-ined, with approximately 60% of the studies assessingthese strategies (see Table 2). Lotions, heat, exercise, rest,relaxation, and special jewelry were examined in at least40% of the studies; use of splints and joint protectionTable 1.

The leastfrequently examined strategies were activity modication,the application of cold or ice, acupuncture, some of the stress and mind-body strategies, and some of the home remedies,with less than 25% of the studies examining these strategies.Table 2.

In most instances,people were less likely to have used a strategy when strat- egy use was assessed within the past 6 months than when assessed within the past year or longer. This conclusion isconsistent with those determined by others (23,26), thatpeople with arthritis may try various strategies but are less likely to continue them. Heat, rest, and exercise were used by the majority of participants in the studies, although frequency of use andascertainment of strategy varied. In Katz's study (4), 49% of the respondents applied heat to parts of their body and 63% used a heated pool, tub, or shower. Arcury et al (23)reported 71% of the participants used heat (unspecied)and Davis et al (18) found that 70% of participants applied heat to painful areas. Ascertainment of exercise also dif- fered among the studies; prevalence of use estimates werevaried. In the studies reporting the highest rates of exer-cise, participants were asked about their use of \"exercise as tolerated\" (18), \"exercise\" (23), and \"gentle activity\" (20,21). Cronan et al (19), reporting the lowest frequency ofexercise, asked participants about use of \"exercise orswimming not prescribed.\" Findings related to use of rest and lotions and ointments were similar to heat and exercise: frequency estimates varied and so did ascertainment. In the study that reportedthe highest use of topical applications, participants werefrom a southern community and were specically askedabout the use of \"ointments-liniments\" (23). Lower esti- mates were found when use of lotions, creams, or oils was assessed (23,25,26). The highest rates of the use of rest asa self-management strategy were ascertained rest\" (4,18,23); thelowest estimates of rest were reported when the use of rest was assessed in a more restrictive manner, such as \"bed rest\" (19) or \"resting more\" (30). Use of activity modication practices and joint protec- tion strategies was examined in only 5 studies; results indicated that these strategies were not commonly used. One study reported that 35% of the participants used jointprotection principles within the past 6 months (20), butother studies reported that fewer than 15% used jointprotection activities or braces or splints (17,20). Dietary practices were examined frequently and as- sessed in many different ways (see Table 2). Generally,about one-third of the participants used these strategies.Some studies examined the use of specic herbs or sup-plements, such as shark cartilage or glucosamine (25,27), garlic (25), grape seed (27), or ginkgo (27), although most assessed the general use of herbs or supplements(4,14,17,19,25-27,29). In addition, 1 assessment includedspecial foods with supplements and herbs (4). Spiritual and relaxation practices (including prayer and meditation) were fairly common, although estimatesranged from 5% (26,29) to as high as 92% (23). Spiritualpractices included attending church or religious servicesand engaging in prayer. In 2 studies (15,23), approximately40% of the participants reported using church services asa self-management practice; whereas in one study, 92% ofthe participants used prayer (23). ACP use was usually assessed within the past year orlonger; only a few studies assessed current use of ACP. Although estimates varied, approximately 25% of the par- ticipants used some type of ACP. Chiropractors and mas- sage therapists were the ACPs most frequently seen; acu-puncturists and homeopathists were least frequently seen. Of the home remedies, special jewelry was the most frequently used strategy; however, in 3 studies, fewer than10% of the participants used special jewelry for their arthritis within the past 6 months. Studies showed that less than 20% of the participants had tried household oils,such as WD-40, turpentine, and other motor oils. Estimates of use within the past month were lower: 3% used WD-40and 7% used turpentine (23). The following strategies were reported only in 1 study and were, therefore, not listed in Table 2: assistive devices (24), environmental changes (30), positive thinking (23), natural healing (26), spiritual healing (26), hypnotism (29),energy healer (29), reflexology (25), dimethyl sulfoxide(17), quit or decrease tobacco use (30), mothballs (23), special clothing (23), orthopedic shoes (17), biofeedback (18), and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (18). In summary, much of the literature focused on use of topical treatments, diet, alternative care strategies, exer-cise, and rest. Use of activity modication practices and joint protection strategies was not examined often, despite the potential benet and long-term importance of these strategies on health outcomes of people with chronic jointproblems. Furthermore, people do not seem to be using these strategies to a great degree. Correlates of strategy use. In Table 3, the sociodemo- graphic and disease-related correlates of strategy use are summarized. Because few studies reported these correla- tions, only patterns and trends are reported. Functionalstatus was the only disease-related factor examined oftenenough to identify patterns and trends. Correlations be- tween disease severity, disease duration, comorbidity, and pain with self-management strategies were not reportedbecause the relations were not examined frequentlyenough to identify any patterns or trends. Dietary practices, alternative care, or home remedies, generally, were not related to sociodemographic factors, although there were a few exceptions. Katz (4) reportedthat people with RA who had more educational attainmentwere more likely to avoid certain foods and use massage compared with people with fewer years of education, even after adjusting for age, sex, race, marital status, income,comorbidity, disease duration, arthritis, number of painfuljoints, presence of severe fatigue, and functional status. Most studies examining these relationships, however, found no differences in strategy use. This discrepancy maybe due to variability in the way educational attainmentwas operationalized. Katz categorized education into 6groups: 0 - 8 years of education, 9 -11 years, 12 years, 13-15 years, 16 years, or 17 or more years of education, but other researchers used educational attainment as a contin-uous variable. Sex differences were found with the use ofalcohol: men were more likely to use whiskey than women(23). Ethnic differences were also found: African Ameri-cans were more likely to use turpentine than whites (23).Critical Review of Arthritis Self-Management Use 727Table 3.

One study showed that people with worse physicalfunctioning were more likely to eat special foods, drink whiskey, use WD-40, or wear special jewelry (23); how- ever, another study found no relationship between func-tional status and use of similar dietary strategies or homeremedies (14). Regarding topical treatments, age and functional status, generally, were not related to use of heat or lotions. In 1study, however, which dichotomized people as age 50years of age or younger and over 50, the younger aged adults were more likely to use a heated pool than the older adults. Findings for sex, race, education, and income weremixed. Men, whites, and those with more income andmore years of educational attainment were more likely to use heat (4,22,23); women and African Americans were more likely to use lotions (23). On the other hand, 2 stud-ies showed no differences in use of topical treatments bysex, race, education, or income (14,22). Activity-related strategies were examined in only a few of the studies, thus, our interpretations are limited. Gen-erally, age and education were not related to exercise, rest,or activity modication practices, although Davis et al (18)found that people who were younger were more likely to use braces or splints. Findings with sex and race were inconsistent. Women and people who were white weremore likely to rest than were men or African Americans(23). On the other hand, no association was found in 2other studies (4,17). Stress and mind-body practices were not related to age, socioeconomic status, or functional status, except in 1study (18) that showed younger adults were more likely toengage in stress control practices. However, there weresome associations between stress and mind-body practices and sex, race, and educational attainment, though only a few studies examined these relations. Katz (4) found thatpeople with more educational attainment were more likelyto attend support groups, use stress control strategies, and use relaxation strategies than were people with fewer years of education. Women and African Americans were morelikely to use prayer and church services compared withmen and people who were white; and whites were morelikely to use positive-thinking strategies (23). In sum, we found no conclusive evidence relating socio- demographic and disease-related factors to self-manage-ment strategy use. Some positive associations were foundbetween sex, race, and functional status and use of topicaltreatments, activity-related strategies, stress and mind- body practices, and folklore strategies. Age, education, and income were generally not related to strategy use. Thesendings, at least in part, are supported by studies thatshow sociodemographic factors contribute only a small amount of variance to self-management strategy use (12,13,19,30,32,33). DISCUSSION The primary aims of this study were 1) to identify therange of strategies that people with arthritis or chronicjoint problems used to manage their condition, and 2) toexamine the sociodemographic and disease-related factors associated with use of these self-management strategies. Ascertainment of strategy use was remarkably varied among the studies, with no 2 studies examining arthritisself-management strategy use in the same manner. Therange of self-initiated strategies used to manage arthritissymptoms and consequences varied and included conven- tional and unconventional activities. No conclusive evi- dence relating sociodemographic and disease-related fac-tors to self-management strategy use was found. These ndings may be explained by 2 factors: 1) a lack of clearly dened and consistent conceptual framework, and 2) methodologic limitations in studies. None of the studiesused the same conceptual framework to identify and de-ne strategies or categories of use; only 2 used a theoretical framework to guide the examination of correlates of strat- egy use (17,30). A clear conceptual framework for arthritisself management\u2014i.e., identify and dene relevant cate-gories or domains\u2014would enable researchers to more easily compare study ndings and assess arthritis self- management behaviors. Without a clear, conceptual frame-work, assessment of the broad range of self-managementstrategy use is unstructured, potentially misleading, anddifcult to duplicate. The conceptual framework of De- Friese and colleagues (7,34) and the 1 proposed in this article could be useful in identifying the broad range ofarthritis self-management strategies and dening catego-ries. In addition to using conceptual frameworks to assess self-management strategy use, conceptual frameworkscould guide research examining the determinants of self-management behaviors. The Behavioral Model of HealthService Utilization (35-37) and the Health Belief Model (38) were used in 2 studies of this review to guide the examination of arthritis self-management strategy use. Us-ing Andersen's model as a framework, Coulton et al (17)showed that pain and number of chronic conditions (iden-tied as need factors in Andersen's model) were the stron- gest correlates of self-management strategy use, after ad- justing for demographic factors. Similar ndings werereported in 2 other studies of self-management practicesamong elderly persons (32,33), suggesting that disease- related factors explained a larger part of the variance in strategy use than sociodemographic factors. Likewise, using the Health Belief Model as a framework, McDonald-Miszczak et al (30) found that among 377 com-munity-dwelling adults 50 years of age or older, perceived seriousness and self-rated health status were associated with self-care behaviors after adjusting for sociodemo-graphic factors, disease-related factors, and health careutilization. Peoples' perceptions, therefore, may influencethe strategies they use to manage their conditions. The self-regulation model (SRM) of Leventhal et al (39 - 41) provides such a framework for understanding how peopleinterpret health threats and how these interpretations in-fluence self-management activities. In the SRM, cognitive representations of and emotional responses to disease states are viewed as proximal determinants of the actionspeople take to enhance their health and to prevent, treat,and rehabilitate from illness. Despite a substantial amount of research on illness rep-Critical Review of Arthritis Self-Management Use 729resentations among people with arthritis, few studies have examined the relation of these factors to the use of specicstrategies people use to cope with arthritis conditions. Using this framework, if people with arthritis interpret pain and fatigue as problematic, they may take actions todecrease these symptoms by avoiding activity, resting, ortaking herbs or supplements; however, if someone inter- prets these symptoms as a consequence of lack of exercise, he or she might start or increase exercise activity. Methodologic differences also may explain the inconsis- tencies found in the articles. Some of the inconsistencies could be due to how self-management strategy use was ascertained, whether confounding factors were includedin modeling strategies, and differences in sample charac-teristics. As shown in the Results section, ascertainment of strategy use varied markedly. In some instances when strategies were very general, such as \"exercised\" or \"rest- ed,\" estimates of use were high. On the other hand, whenvery specic strategies were assessed, such as \"bed rest\" or \"cod liver oil,\" use estimates were lower. Differences in ascertainment of strategy use may explain a substantialamount of the variance in prevalence estimates. In addi-tion, because many of the strategies were assessed glo-bally, exercise for example, we do not know whether peo- ple using these strategies engaged in the appropriate type of exercise, safely performed the exercise (e.g., minimizingabnormal joint forces), or exercised long enough to haveany health benet. A clear conceptual framework of arthri-tis self-management categories or domains should enable researchers to develop better assessment instruments. Some of the discrepancies in the correlates of strategy use may be due to differences in analytic approaches. Forexample, several differences were found between whitesand African Americans in relation to use of medications, rest, spiritual practices, and household oils in a large rep- resentative sample from a rural southern community; how-ever, socioeconomic factors were not adjusted in thesemodels, which may in part explain the ethnic differences. In the study reported by Coulton et al (17), several ethnic differences were found in univariate models; however,when models were adjusted for socioeconomic factors andphysical disability, the associations between race and self-management strategy use were no longer signicant. Furthermore, because all studies in this review were cross-sectional, we are unable to ascertain whether suchfactors as functional status or pain influenced strategychoice and use. In a longitudinal study on self-manage-ment among community-dwelling elders, elderly persons who reported consistent joint pain and stiffness (arthritis- related symptoms) at 4 time points over 27 months weremore likely to use self-management strategies than werepersons who reported inconsistent symptoms (joint pain or stiffness 3 or fewer times over a 27-month interval) (42). Symptom recurrence over time, therefore, seemed to berelated to self-management practices, potentially support-ing the SRM approach of Leventhal et al to illness inter-pretation and self-management behaviors. There are limitations to our approach to this article. First, it was difcult to classify some ndings using ourclassication scheme, and as a result we may have ob-scured some ndings. Although we tried to establish clearand reliable guidelines for interpreting the data, other researchers may not agree with our classication frame-work. Nonetheless, a wide range of strategies was used,many inconsistencies were present, ascertainment of strat-egy use varied, and few studies reported specic relationsbetween sociodemographic and disease-related factors anduse of our self-management categories. Second, we found only 19 articles meeting our criteria. The ndings are, therefore, limited to trends and patterns and should beinterpreted with caution. There is great interest amonghealth professionals regarding the strategies people use to manage arthritis; however, those who have studied these behaviors among persons with arthritis have approachedthese issues in an ad hoc manner, using highly idiosyn-cratic measures resulting in primarily descriptive informa-tion and many inconsistent ndings. We do not knowwhether use of various self-management strategies is in-fluenced by episodes of acute pain or discomfort; func-tional loss; cultural factors; or intentional, preventive, pre- cautionary measures. Lastly, we know very little about the levels of knowledge, skills, or experience with these self-management strategies that are required to practice themwith any likelihood of realizing a therapeutic effect.
