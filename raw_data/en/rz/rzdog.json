Many people have health problems that lower their overall quality of their life, with no true relief in sight. Doctors will often simply prescribe medicine that will temporarily alleviate the side effects without addressing the real issue. Medical practices are regularly overbooked, which means your time with a doctor may be limited. We offer a different approach to helping you get your health back on track. Our medical staff is trained in holistic and integrative medicine, which is a whole systems approach to your care. The holistic approach is based on finding and treating the root cause of your pain or symptoms, instead of just burying it with more pharmaceuticals. Merely treating with prescription drugs may result in worse health outcomes over time, either due to their inherent side effects of the drugs, or because the root issues have not been addressed. Our clinic's doctor is a naturopathic doctor, someone who makes use of naturopathic medicine.
