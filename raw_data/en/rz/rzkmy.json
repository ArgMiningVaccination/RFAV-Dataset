[[88]](#cite_note-88) [[89]](#cite_note-89) - It has been suggested that the study of this phenomenon has had major political consequences. Following the [sensational stranding of a Soviet submarine](/wiki/Soviet_submarine_S-363)deep inside Swedish waters on 27 October 1981, the Swedish navy initiated a large-scale campaign to guard Swedish territorial waters from the perceived threat of infiltration by foreign submarines, despite [the Soviets](/wiki/Soviet_Union)consistently asserting that the stranding had occurred due to navigational errors. The [\"submarine hunts\"](/wiki/Swedish_submarine_incidents), which lasted throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, have been a heavily debated issue in Sweden, as to whether or not there ever was any factual substance to the claims of Soviet infiltration. One widely reported piece of \"evidence\" were several sound recordings of what the Swedish navy suspected to be foreign submarines. Oceanographers and marine biologists were invited to study the recordings and would eventually find that the sounds heard were most probably produced not by submarines, but in fact were the noises made when herring passed gas. In a reportage by the Swedish science magazine \"Vetenskapens v\u00e4rld\" (\"World of science\") televised on 16 April 2012, it's suggested that these findings were important in putting an end to the costly \"submarine hunts\" which had continued for more than a decade, with Ig Nobel laureate H\u00e5kan Westerberg guessing that this would have saved Swedish tax payers hundreds of millions in [SEK](/wiki/Swedish_krona).
