Bowes1, Thomas H. Costello1, 2, 3, and Arber Tasimi1 1Department of Psychology, Emory University 2Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology 3Department of Psychology, University of Regina A tidal wave of research has tried to uncover the motivational and personological correlates of conspiratorial ideation, often studying these two classes of correlates in parallel. Here, we synthesize this vast and piecemeal literature through a multilevel meta-analytic review that spanned 170 studies, 257 samples, 52 variables, 1,429 effect sizes, and 158,473 participants. Overall, we found that the strongest correlates of conspiratorial ideation pertained to (a) perceiving danger and threat, (b) relying on intuition and having odd beliefs and experiences, and (c) being antagonistic and acting superior. Considerable heterogeneity wasfound within these relations --especially when individual variables were lumped together under a single domain --and we identi ed potential boundary conditions in these relations (e.g., type of conspiracy). Given that the psychological correlates of conspiratorial ideation have often been classi ed as belonging to one of two broad domains \u2014motivation or personality \u2014we aim to understand the implications of such heterogeneity for frameworks of conspiratorial ideation. We conclude with directions for future researchthat can lead to a uni ed account of conspiratorial ideation. Public Signi cance Statement This empirical \"one-stop-shop \"provides a comprehensive overview of the motivational and personological correlates of conspiratorial ideation. We nd that most motivational and personological variables reported in the literature were signi cantly related to conspiratorial ideation, but effect sizes varied considerably. We discuss the implications of our ndings for future research that can leverage our quantitative review to bridge motivation and personality and, ultimately, arrive at a uni ed account of conspiratorial ideation. Keywords: conspiratorial https://doi.org/10.1037/bul0000392.supp Conspiratorial ideation is everywhere. Indeed, most surveyed participants all over the world endorse at least one conspiracy theory (CT; e.g., Atari et al., 2019 ;Goertzel, 1994 ;Kowalski et al., 2020 ; Oliver & Wood, 2014 ;Swami, 2012 ;van Prooijen & Douglas, 2018 ). A growing number of psychologists have become interested in illuminating conspiratorial ideation by looking at two keyquestions: (a) What are the motivational correlates of conspiratorialideation? (b) What are the personological correlates of conspiratorial ideation? Although motivation and personality are deeply intertwined (e.g., Dweck, 2017 ;Grapsas et al., 2020 ;Strus & Cieciuch, 2017 ),research in the domain of conspiratorial ideation has largely pursued these two lines of work in parallel. As a result, there isconsiderable heterogeneity across frameworks of conspiratorialideation and often little overlap between these frameworks. Someframeworks emphasize the centrality of personological constructs(e.g., general personality traits, see Goreis & Voracek, 2019 ), whereas others do not mention personological constructs whatso- ever (e.g., van Prooijen & Douglas, 2018 ). Moreover, both personality and motivation span scores of discrete constructs thathave been examined, for the most part, in a piecemeal fashion inrelation to conspiratorial ideation. Here, we provide what is, to ourknowledge, the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date on thisexploding phenomenological workspace. What Is Conspiratorial Ideation? Although scholars continue to debate how best to distinguish conspiracy theories from truth (and whether all conspiracy theories are psychologically equivalent; see Brotherton, 2015 ;van Prooijen, 2018 ), there is considerable consensus surrounding the core features of conspiracy theories.

Thus, the de nitional recipe of conspiracy theories involves three primary ingredients: (a) conspirators, (b) hiddenplans, and (c) malintent against others or society; this de nitional recipe holds whether conspiracy theories turn out to be true or not (seeBrotherton, 2015 ;van Prooijen, 2018 ). Conspiratorial ideation, therefore, refers to a tendency to endorse conspiracy theories. An Exploding (and Piecemeal) Phenomenological Workspace Conspiratorial ideation is a rapidly expanding area of investigation. From January 2020 to February 2023, for example, over 16,000 results on Google Scholar appeared when searching for \"conspirato- rial ideation \"or\"conspiracy belief \"or\"conspiracy theory. \"Similarly, in a recent narrative review on the psychology of conspiratorial ideation, the number of studies on conspiracy beliefs increased bymore than 150% in just 1 year alone (i.e., from 2020 to 2021; see Pilch et al., 2023 ). Perhaps it may come as no surprise that a handful of meta-analyses have already provided deep dives into the relations between conspiratorial ideation and certain psychological variables(e.g., paranoia ,s e e Imhoff & Lamberty, 2018; control ,s e e Stojanov & Halberstadt, 2020 ) and domains (e.g., broadband ( Biddlestone et al., 2022 )\u2014have become available since the initial submission of our article and provide broad characterizations of the personologicaland the motivational correlates of conspiratorial ideation. The published meta-analysis examined the most common variables assessed in relation to conspiratorial ideation ( Stasielowicz, 2022 ; seeTable 1) and were typically personality traits or personological phenomena. Broadly, their ndings revealed that indices of psychopathology (e.g., paranoia) were stronger correlates ofconspiratorial ideation than normal-range personality traits (e.g.,extraversion). Although informative, this meta-analysis does notshed light on a theoretical framework of conspiratorial ideation,rendering it challenging to leverage their ndings and revise theory in the service of inspiring future research. Moreover, and aspreviously noted, research on conspiratorial ideation is exploding.Because the landscape surrounding conspiratorial ideation is evershifting, there may very well be 12 different popular constructsnow 1than at the time this previous meta-analysis was conducted. Focusing on commonly studied variables also does not re flect the vast universe of personality dimensions (e.g., M\u00f5ttus et al., 2020 ). Moreover, in trying to understand how people differ from one another in their personality traits (and how these differencesmight map onto conspiratorial ideation), it is important to considerwhy people think, feel, and act the way they do. Thus, it would be useful to also consider motivational constructs in the context of conspiratorial ideation. After all, personality may be born outof motivation (for more on this issue, see Dweck, 2017 ). Drawing on a popular theory suggesting that a deprivation of three motivational needs (epistemic, existential, and social) may lead people to endorse conspiracy theories (see Douglas et al., 2017 ), a recent preprint examined said motivational domains in to conspiratorial ideation ( Biddlestone et al., 2022 ;s e e Table 2 ). Broad support for this tripartite motivational model was found in this meta- analytic work. Yet, several ndings at the variable-level provided \"uncertain evidence \"in support of the tripartite model per Bayesian analyses, making it dif cult to draw rm conclusions about the validity of this theory. There was also considerable heterogeneitywithin the selected domains. For instance, the relation between thedomain of collective social motives and conspiratorial ideation wassmall and positive, but the individual correlations within this domainranged from small and negative (e.g., low ingroup identi cation) to large and positive (e.g., perceived ingroup victimhood). When considering the limitations of and heterogeneity present in previous meta-analytic reviews, it becomes apparent that thereare several reasons why a comprehensive replication and extension ofpriorndings is important in the space of conspiratorial ideation. Chief among these reasons is that no meta-analysis to date has applied thesame set of search strategies, coding schemes, and analytic approachesto both motivational and personological correlates of conspiratorialideation (or even examined them simultaneously). Although useful,currently available meta-analyses are neither suf ciently comprehen- sive nor suf ciently precise to sustain meaningful conclusions about the speci city, generalizability, magnitude, and heterogeneity of relations between conspiratorial ideation and motivation andpersonality. Given the considerable researcher degrees of freedompresent in meta-analytic reviews (see de Vrieze, 2018), comparing across meta-analyses is fraught with opacity. This opacity makes itimportant to adopt a uni ed approach, as presented here. Bridging Motivation and Personality To broaden beyond the aims of previous meta-analyses, the current investigation seeks to br idge motivation and personality. While we do not claim that our individual meta-analytic estimatesare necessarily more accurate than other reviews (e.g., Biddlestone et al., 2022 ;Stasielowicz, 2022 ), our estimates of the relative explanatory power of each variable, relative to other variables included in ourThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

Bold indicates that the correlation is statistically signi cant per the credibility interval limits.1In our meta-analysis, we also identi ed that normal-range traits, intelligence, and paranoia are commonly examined correlates of conspiratorial ideation. That said, we additionally identi ed trust, self-reported intuition, self- reported rationality, cognitive re flection, anxiety, and social dominance orientation as commonly assessed variables (see Results section). Thesedifferences across meta-analyses reveal that the terrain surroundingconspiratorial ideation is vast \u2014and ever-changing.2 BOWES, COSTELLO, AND TASIMImeta-analytic \"map of the known world, \"may be especially accurate. After all, we use the same analytic approach, coding scheme, and statistical decision-making processes for each variable. It is essential to examine both motivation and personality in relation to conspiratorial ideation, and this view is not just rooted in an aimto be comprehensive for the sake of being comprehensive. Instead,there is a strong theoretical foundation for considering motivationalongside personality. Several lines of research are dedicated to bridging motivation with personality (e.g., Bouchard & Johnson, 2021 ;Denissen et al., 2020 ;Jayawickreme et al., 2019 ), pointing to the idea that independently examining motivation and personality prevents critical insights onto important topics. Generally, researchshows that imposing strict theoretical boundaries between motivation and personality is less well supported than is commonly supposed (seeCorr et al., 2013 ;Strus & Cieciuch, 2017 ). There are multiple theories regarding how to integrate motivational processes most effectively with personality traits, such as integratingthem into a circumplex model (e.g., Strus & Cieciuch, 2017 oa developmental framework (see Dweck, 2017 ). Nevertheless, these various theories tend to share a distinction between descriptive (orstructural) and explanatory (or process-oriented) aspects of traits (e.g.,Denissen & Penke, 2008 ;Jayawickreme et al., 2019 ;M\u00f5ttus et al., 2020 ). Descriptive aspects of a trait broadly refer to the ways that personality traits are measured (see M\u00f5ttus et al., 2020 ) and the aggregation of individual, state-level behaviors (see Fleeson & Jayawickreme, 2015 ). In essence, this level of a trait is the \"what \"of a trait. The explanatory aspect of a trait, in turn, refers to the speci c c a u s eo fas p e c i c behavior (see M\u00f5ttus et al., 2020 ) and the cognitive, motivational, and affective processes that shape momen-tary information processing (see Jayawickreme et al., 2019 ). In essence, this level of a trait is the \"how\"of a trait. Explanatory aspects of a trait emphasize how the descriptive elements of a trait arise. Perthis distinction, motivations cause (e.g., Dweck, 2017 )o ra r ee v e n part-and-parcel (e.g., Fleeson & Jayawickreme, 2015 ) of traits. By bringing together motivation and personality, it will be possible to clarify what causes conspiratorial ideation and gain a deeper understanding of how and why conspiratorial ideation predicts a host of relevant outcomes (especially behaviors; see Dweck, 2017 ). With this approach, we might be one step closer at designing effective interventions for reducing conspiratorial ideation, as both the \"what \"(descriptive/structural) and the \"how\"(explanatory/process-oriented) will be considered by targeting broad areas of liability. Further, by including motivational and personological variables under the same meta-analytic roof, our review facilities comparisons of the relative explanatory power of individual psychologicalvariables for conspiratorial ideation. Consistent with the classic debate of lumping versus splitting in psychological science (see Fiske, 2006 ), the domains of epistemic, existential, and social motives represent lumping --a plethora of motives are joined together under one heading. Through lumping these motives, we can understand how shared processes bear on conspiratorial ideation. Nevertheless, lumping variables together can wash out meaningfulsignals at lower levels of analysis, including facet-level analyses and even item-level analyses (see M\u00f5ttus et al., 2020 ). Thus, by accounting for individual variables in addition to their broad domains, it will be possible to gain actionable insights into the relations between conspiratorial ideation and motives and traits. In other words, we will be probing into individual variables for bothmotivations (explanatory) and traits (descriptive). These compar-isons across variables, rather than just domains, provide a rich opportunity to replicate (and extend upon) previous research. All in all, we suspect that an extension of previous meta-analytic relations is needed to (a) clarify the relations between motivational and personological variables and conspiratorial ideation and to (b) illuminate sources of heterogeneity. We begin by describing motivational and personological correlates of conspiratorial idea-tion, and then provide the ndings from our meta-analysis, which spanned 170 studies, 257 samples, 52 variables, 1,429 effect sizes,and 158,473 participants. We conclude by outlining promisingdirections for future research as we look forward to the possibilityof developing a uni ed theory of conspiratorial ideation. Motivational Correlates of Conspiratorial Ideation According to one popular perspective ( Douglas et al., 2017 ), people are drawn to conspiracy theories when they experience adeprivation of the following three motivational needs: 1. To form a reliable, certain, and stable view of the world (epistemic motives). 2. To feel safe and in control, particularly in the face of threat (existential motives). 3. To reinforce a superior, albeit fragile, image of oneself and one's ingroup ( social motives). In the following sections, we review these three motivational domains and describe constructs that fall within each (e.g., Douglas et al., 2017 ,2019 ;Pierre, 2020 ;Sternisko 2019 ). We also describe the denitions of relevant constructs according to these existing organizational schemes. 2We sought to test theories surroundingThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

Of these ve constructs, all were placed under one domain more than the others (e.g., alienation is more often classi ed as social than existential). The remaining variables were consistently placed under the same domain across frameworks of conspiratorial ideation.CONSPIRATORIAL IDEATION META-ANALYSIS 3the psychology of conspiratorial ideation. As such, we coded motivational variables according to frameworks of conspiratorialideation rather than frameworks of motivations per se (the latter ofwhich was adopted in a preprint; see Biddlestone et al., 2022 ). We adopted this coding approach to test the heuristic value of the tripartite motivational model and existing frameworks of conspira-torial ideation. Epistemic Motives A drive to understand the everyday world is one reason why people may be drawn to conspiracy theories. Identifying intuitive explanations for ambiguous events, nding meaning in unpredict- ability and chaos, and maintaining one 's beliefs in the face of contradiction correspond to epistemic motives ( Douglas et al., 2017 ). By relying on intuition, people can readily form accessible explanations for uncertain situations and, in turn, generate a quickunderstanding of the world. These intuitive understandings of theworld afford the opportunity for people to nd clarity and meaning in their environment. To hold onto this intuitive and meaning-ladenunderstanding of the world, people may additionally strive touphold their beliefs rather than face additional uncertainty (see Kay et al., 2009 ). Conspiratorial ideation is related to reliance on intuition and reduced analytical thinking. More precisely, conspiratorial ideationmanifests medium-to-large positive associations with measures ofintuitive thinking, including self-report measures of reliance onintuition and quasibehavioral measures of intuition (e.g., suscepti-bility to pseudoprofound bullshit, susceptibility to the conjunctionfallacy; e.g., Brotherton & French, 2014 ;avojov \u00e1et al., 2019 Dagnall et al., 2017 ;Hart & Graether, 2018 ;Moulding et al., 2016 ; Patel et al., 2019 ;Pennycook et al., 2015 ;van der Wal et al., 2018 ). 3 Dovetailing with these ndings, conspiratorial ideation is strongly related to nonclinical delusion-proneness, indicating a propensityto engage in intuitive and irrational thinking (e.g., Brotherton et al., 2013 ;Dagnall et al., 2015 ). Regarding analytical thinking, conspiratorial ideation is weakly-to-moderately negatively associ-ated with self-report measures of rationality and cognitive re flection (e.g., Barron et al., 2018 ;Castanho Silva et al., 2017 ;St\u00e5hl & van Prooijen, 2018 ;Swami et al., 2014 ), although these relations are not always signi cant (e.g., Ballov \u00e1Miku kov\u00e1, 2018 ;Patel et ). Moreover, conspiratorial ideation and need for cognition (i.e., preferences for complexity in thought; Cacioppo & Petty, 1982 ) are weakly-to-moderately negatively associated (e.g., Barron et al., 2018 ;St\u00e5hl & van Prooijen, 2018 ; cf. Miller et al., 2016 ). These results raise the possibility that individuals proneto conspiratorial ideation are motivated to understand the worldby engaging in intuitive, effortless thinking as opposed to rational,effortful, and complex thinking. An overreliance on intuition coupled with a drive to nd meaning can contribute to identifying patterns where none exist(i.e., illusory pattern perception; van Elk, 2015; Walker et al., 2019 ) or identifying agency where none exists (i.e., hypersensitive agency detection; see Douglas et al., 2016 ;Whitson & Galinsky, 2008 ). People prone to conspiratorial ideation are presumably also prone to such patternicity; after all, conspiracy theories entailidentifying secret plotting by nefarious individuals (e.g., van Prooijen, 2018). Bearing out this possibility, illusory patternperception tends to manifest large, positive correlations withconspiratorial ideation (e.g., Moulding et al., 2016 2018 ;van der Tempel & Alcock, 2015 ;van der Wal et al., 2018 ;van Prooijen et al., 2018 ). Similarly, being overly attuned to agency in others and the tendency to anthropomorphize,also known as hypersensitive agency detection (i.e., Brotherton & French, 2015 ;Douglas et al., 2016 ;Enders & Smallpage, 2019; Imhoff & Bruder, 2014 ) and respectively, moderately positively associat ed with conspiratorial ideation (e.g., Brotherton & French, 2015 ;Bruder et al., 2013 ;Douglas et al., 2016 ). Since conspiracy theories sometimes have the fa\u00e7ade of being evidence-based and can be supported by a variety of misleading arguments (e.g., Dagnall et al., 2017 ;Goertzel, 1994 ), they may be particularly appealing to those who are prone to maintain their worldviews in the face of new evidence and tend to not thinkeffortfully. In support of these suppositions, conspiratorial ideation is weakly-to-moderately and positively linked with dogmatism (e.g., avojov \u00e1et al., 2020 ) and moderately and negatively linked with actively open-minded thinking (e.g., Erceg et al., 2022 ;Patel et al., 2019 ;Stanovich & Toplak, 2019 ;Swami et al., 2014 ). Given that conspiracy theories provide seemingly de nite explanations for largescale events, it has also been theorized thatconspiratorial ideation is related to strong motives for, andthe propensity to maintain, certainty (e.g., Douglas et al., 2017 ; Kossowska & Bukowski, 2015 ). Desire for certainty entails overlapping motivations, including need for cognitive closure(i.e., the desire for any answer over uncertainty and preference fororder and structure; see Webster & Kruglanski, 1994 ) and intolerance of ambiguity (i.e., the propensity to feel distressed byinformation that is vague, open-ended, or uncertain; see Grenier et al., 2005 ). Conspiratorial ideation tends to be positively related with total scores on self-report inventories of need for closureand intolerance of ambiguity; yet, most of these results are notsignicant and/or the effect sizes are small (e.g., Castanho Silva et al., 2017 ;Golec de Zavala & Federico, 2018 ;Leman & Cinnirella, 2013 ;Marchlewska et al., 2018 ;Moulding et al., 2016 ;Swami et al., 2014 ). To summarize across all epistemic motives, conspiratorial ideation appears to be related to in flexible cognitive styles, including reliance on intuition, identifying patterns and agencyin their absence, and maintaining one 's views while being close- minded to alternative views. Still, individuals prone to conspira-torial ideation may also lack the cognitive abilities to evaluate information accurately and critically (see Douglas et al., 2017 , 2019). 4To address this possibility, scholars have directed attention toward the relation between intelligence and conspiratorialideation. Across studies and measures of intelligence, thereappears to be a consistent negative relation between conspiratorialideation and general cognitive ability, although the magnitude of these relations ranges from small to large (e.g., Adam-Troian et al., 2019; Betsch et al., 2018 ;avojov \u00e1et Johnson, 2019; Lantian et al., 2020; Pennycook et al., 2020 ;This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly. 3Here and throughout, effect sizes were interpreted according to Gignac and Szodorai 's (2016) guidelines for individual differences research: r=.10 is small, r=.20 is medium, and r=.30 is large. 4A conspiracy theory is still a theory at the time of initial acceptance. As such, the same psychological variables (e.g., low cognitive ability) that give rise to conspiratorial ideation are theorized to be the same across conspiracytheories, whether they turn out to be true or false (see van Prooijen, 2018 ).4 BOWES, COSTELLO, AND TASIMIStieger et al., 2013 ;Swami & Furnham, 2012 ). Thus, it seems that conspiratorial ideation may be related to reduced tendencies and motivations to pursue complexity and a reduced ability to make sense of complex information. Existential Motives Another reason why people may be drawn to conspiracy theories is to feel safe and in control, especially in the face of existential threat (e.g., Douglas et al., 2017 ;van Prooijen, 2019 ). Thus, conspiracy theories may appeal to those scoring high on existential threat, as individuals are deprived of a sense of security andpower. For example, if the September 11th attacks were orchestratedby the American government rather than an extremist group, thenpeople can spread the word and prevent such an attack fromhappening again by voting for the \"right \"politicians. Research reveals that conspiratorial ideation is moderately to strongly and positively related to perceptions of existential threat (e.g., Federico et al., 2018 ), such as perceiving that one 's nation faces great threat (e.g., Cichocka, Marchlewska, & Golec de Zavala, 2016 ) and that one experiences more threat than others (e.g., Imhoff et al., 2018 ). Existential threats can manifest in several ways, and they often pertain to losing a sense of personal meaning andconfronting information that challenges one 's cherished beliefs (e.g., van den Bos, 2009 ;van Prooijen, 2019 ). In addition to perceiving more threat, conspiratorial ideation is moderately tostrongly and positively related to believing that the world isinherently dangerous and unstable (e.g., Leone et al., 2019 ; Moulding et al., 2016 ), perceiving one 's world with cynicism rather than optimism (e.g., Bensley et al., 2020 ;Enders et al., 2020 ; Swami, 2012 ;Swami et al., 2011 ;Vitriol & Marsh, 2018 ), and feeling powerless (e.g., Biddlestone et al., 2020 ;Bruder et al., 2013 ; Imhoff & Bruder, 2014 ;Jolley & Douglas, 2014 ;Moulding et al., 2016 ;van Prooijen et al., 2018 ). If people detect more threats in their environment and regard the world as inherently dangerous, they are likely to (a) feel moreanxious, (b) perceive that they have less control, and (c) feel lessefcacious. Research has examined how conspiratorial ideation is related to all three of these possibilities. First, conspiratorialideation is related to experiencing more anxiety, including generalanxiety (e.g., Erceg et al., 2022 ;Grzesiak-Feldman, 2013 ;rol et al., 2021 ) and death anxiety (e.g., Bruder et al., 2013 ;Stojanov & Halberstadt, 2019 ), although these relations tend to be small. Despite relatively consistent cross-sectional links between anxietyand existential threat sensitivity and conspiratorial ideation, someresearch shows that anxiety and existential threat sensitivity donot seem to temporally precede conspiratorial ideation; suchresults raise questions about whether and to what extent anxiety andexistential threat sensitivity are causes of conspiratorial ideation(Liekefett et al., 2023 ). When people experience threat and anxiety, they are likely to perceive that they possess little to no control over theirenvironments. In line with this possibility, conspiratorial ideationtends to manifest small-to-medium negative correlations withperceptions of control (e.g., Bruder et al., 2013 ;rol et al., 2021 ; Stone et al., 2018 ). Moreover, experimentally increasing a perceived loss of control gives rise to greater conspiratorial ideation (e.g.,Whitson et al., 2019 ;Whitson & Galinsky, 2008 ). Still, a recent meta-analysis on the associations between experimentally inducedcontrol and conspiratorial ideation indicated that the relationship was small and not signi cant ( d=.05, 2020 ). This meta-analysis raises the possibility that results from individual studies areexaggerated and/or that there are potentially key, albeit overlooked,moderators of the relations between conspiratorial ideation andcontrol. Finally, although conspiratorial ideation appears to be only weakly related to feeling that one possesses less control, researchindicates that conspiratorial ideation is related to feeling that onepossesses less ef cacy, or an ability to make changes in one 's environment. Research demonstrates that conspiratorial ideation is negatively related to multiple manifestations of ef cacy, such as self-ef cacy (e.g., external-ef cacy (e.g., Ard\u00e8vol-Abreu ), and political-ef cacy & Stiller, 2021 ). Social Motives A third reason why people may be drawn to conspiracy theories is that they afford opportunities to defend a positive image of themselves and their ingroup (e.g., Douglas et al., 2019 ;Sternisko et al., 2020 ). By endorsing a conspiracy theory that places blame on others (often members of another group), people can retain asense of superiority, both at the individual and group levels (e.g.,Cichocka, Marchlewska, & Golec de Zavala, 2016 ). Ascribing blame to an outgroup for societal ills may reinforce notions thatone's ingroup is blameless and superior. Thus, conspiracy theories should be particularly compelling to those with a fragile sense-of-self and/or those who perceive outgroup threat. Consistent with these ideas, conspiratorial ideation is moderately and positively related to perceiving a largescale moral breakdownin society (i.e., anomie; Brotherton et al., 2013 ;Bruder et al., 2013 ; Imhoff & Bruder, 2014 ;Imhoff et al., 2018 ;Jolley et al., 2019 ; Majima & Nakamura, 2020 ;Moulding et al., 2016 ) and feeling alienated from others (e.g., Lamberty & Leiser, 2019 ;Leman & Cinnirella, 2013 ;Swami et al., 2013 ). Conspiratorial ideation is also weakly negatively related to healthy self-esteem, as a stable,balanced, positive self-regard likely allays social threats to one 's ego and buffers against feelings of alienation (e.g., Cichocka, Marchlewska, & Golec de Zavala, 2016 ;Stieger et al., ; Swami, ;van Prooijen et al., 2018 ). Because conspiratorial ideation i s related to a fragile sense-of- self, it should not only be related to less self-esteem but also to more narcissism (i.e., nonclinical manifestations of the morepernicious constellation of traits comprising narcissistic personal-ity disorder; see Pincus et al., 2009 ). Narcissism comprises a complex blend of overcon dence and vulnerability, meaning that narcissistic individuals tend to boast while also needingvalidation from others (e.g., Miller & Campbell, 2010 ). In line with expectations, conspiratorial ideation is weakly-to-moderately and positively related to narcissism (e.g., et al., 2021; Cichocka, Marchlewska, & Golec de Zavala, 2016). These results point to the possibility that people who endorse conspiracy theories are motivated to stand out among their peers andfeel entitled to special recognition.

Thus, conspiratorial ideation may be related to needs to stand out among one 's peers (e.g., boastfulness) in conjunction with a tendency to distrust one's peers (e.g., vulnerable self-esteem). Research aligns with these possibilities: conspiratorial ideation is moderately to need for uniqueness (e.g., D\u00edaz & Cova, ;Imhoff et et al., 2017 ;Lyons et al., 2019 ) and a general distrust of others (from peers to politicians to institutions; e.g., Brotherton et al., 2013 ;Jolley & Douglas, 2014 ;Lantian et al., 2016 ;Leman & Cinnirella, 2013 ;Meuer 2021 ;Stojanov & Halberstadt, 2019 ). This general mistrust of others may be an important aspect ofconspiratorial ideation that turns people away from of cial narratives and facilitates identifying a clear enemy (see Meuer & Imhoff, 2021; Pierre, 2020 ). These data converge on an image of conspiratorial ideation being linked to needs to valorize the self, as conspiracy theorists may perceive that they are in possession of special talents and knowledge while simultaneously feeling skeptical of others. A similar pattern of relations emerges when examining the relations between conspiratorial ideation and perceptions ofone's ingroup. If one believes that their group is exceptional, superior, and deserving of greater recognition, then they willlikely perceive outgroups as threatening and inferior (e.g., Golec de Zavala & Lantos, 2020 ). And indeed, people often target outgroup individuals as the conspirators behind threatening events (e.g.,Mashuri & Zaduqisti, 2014 ;van Prooijen & Song, 2021 ). These conspiracy stereotypes may protect and valorize one 's ingroup identity vis- \u00e0-vis outsourcing blame 2021 ). Thus, conspiratorial ideation should be related to (a) holding a positiveview of one 's ingroup and (b) holding a negative view of one 's outgroup. Looking at the rst point, conspiratorial ideation is positively related both to collective self-esteem Marchlewska, Golec de Zavala, & Olechowski, et ;Swami et al., 2018 ;Uenal et al., 2021 ) and collective et al., 2020 ;Marchlewska et al., 2019 ). Preliminary research indicates that when statistically controlling for the overlap between collectiveself-esteem and collective narcissism, there is a mutual suppressoreffect such that the positive relation for collective self-esteem andconspiratorial ideation becomes negative whereas the that conspiratorial ideation is related to perceivingone's ingroup as inherently better than the outgroup, whereas it is negatively related to healthy pride in one 's ingroup. Looking at the rst point (i.e., holding a negative view of one 's outgroup), conspiratorial ideation is strongly related to enhanced Cichocka, 2021 ;van Prooijen & Song, 2021 ). Given that conspiracy \"authorities while denigrating \"illegitimate \"others, conspiratorial bothright-wing authoritarianism (RWA; see Grzesiak-Feldman, 2015 ) and (SDO; see Swami, 2012 ). RWAreflects obsequious submission to established authority, adherence to socially conservative norms, and aggression towards people whotransgress against these norms (e.g., Duckitt et al., 2010 ); SDO reflects the tendency to prefer social hierarchies that maintain power over lower status groups (e.g., Ho et al., 2015 ). Several studies indicate that conspiratorial ideation is weakly-to-moderately andpositively associated with RWA (e.g., Bruder et al., 2013 ;Swami, 2012 ;Wood & Gray, 2019 ). Conspiratorial ideation also tends to be weakly-to-moderately and positively related to SDO (e.g., Bruder et al., 2013 ;Green & Douglas, 2018 ;Imhoff & Bruder, 2014 ; Imhoff et al., 2018 ;Kerr, 2020 ;Lamberty Leiser, 2019 ). Personological Correlates of Conspiratorial Ideation Personological constructs are relevant to a host of beliefs, from political ideology (e.g., Fatke, 2017 ) to religiosity (e.g., Gebauer et al., 2013 ) to determinism beliefs (e.g., Costello et al., 2020 ). As such, psychologists have become increasingly interested in illuminating the personological correlates of conspiratorial ideation(e.g., Bowes 2022 ). Below, we provide overviews of two key areas of research on the personological correlates of conspiratorial ideation, one on abnormal-range correlates and the other on normal-range personal-ity correlates. Abnormal-Range Correlates Historically, there has been a focus on the intersection between conspiratorial ideation and abnormal psychological processes.Scholars have largely focused on two separable, albeit highly related,domains of abnormality and their relations to conspiratorial ideation:(a)personality disorders (i.e., enduring, in flexible, and stable patterns of thought and behavior that deviate signi cantly from cultural and normative expectations, leading to marked impairment and distress;seeSleep et al., 2019 ) and (b) psychopathology (i.e., a broad domain comprising a heterogeneous array of emotional, behavioral, andcognitive dysfunctions that collectively give rise to markedimpairment and distress; see Kotov et al., 2021 ). Looking at personality disorders, scholars posited over 50 years ago that conspiratorial ideation was fundamental to paranoidpersonality (e.g., Hofstadter, 1964 ). This line of thinking has carried over into modern frameworks of conspiratorial ideation, assome scholars contend that paranoia is part-and-parcel of theconspiracist worldview, meaning that it may be necessary to scorehighly on measures of paranoia (e.g., distrust others, perceivemalintent in others) to be a conspiracy theorist (e.g., Brotherton & Eser, 2015 ;Dagnall et al., 2015 ;van der Linden et al., 2021 ). As a result, several studies examining the relations between conspira-torial ideation and personality disorder traits have focused onparanoia, a de ning characteristic of paranoid personality disorder (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013 ). Results support both historical and contemporary accounts of the centrality ofparanoia to conspiratorial ideation, such that those who score higheron measures of paranoia also report more conspiratorial ideation(e.g., Brotherton & Eser, 2015 Zavala, 2016 ;van Prooijen et al., 2015 ). Indeed, a recent meta-analysis on the relations between conspirato-rial ideation and paranoia ( Imhoff & Lamberty, 2018 ) indicatedThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.6 BOWES, COSTELLO, AND TASIMIthat conspiratorial ideation was strongly r=.36, 95% CI [.30, .46]). In addition to paranoia, scholars have examined the relations between conspiratorial ideation and schizotypal personality disorder(schizotypy), as it is closely related to and imbued with paranoia(e.g., Cicero & Kerns, 2010 ). Schizotypy is characterized by odd and bizarre thinking styles, social awkwardness, ideas ofreference (e.g., events are nonrandom and personally meaningful),and disorganized communication (e.g., unclear or strange patternsof speech; see Raine, 1991 ). Schizotypal traits contribute to holding anomalous beliefs (e.g., paranormal beliefs; see Hergovich et al., 2008 ) and exhibiting decision-making biases (e.g., jumping- to-conclusions; see Hua al., 2020 ) germane to conspiratorial ideation (e.g., Bronstein et al., 2019 ;Bruder et al., 2013 ). As such, some maintain that schizotypal features are fundamental tothe conspiracist worldview (e.g., Dagnall et al., 2015 ). In line with this thinking, conspiratorial ideation manifests medium-to-large positive correlations with total scores on schizotypy measuresas well as scores on lower order schizotypal facets, such as oddand bizarre thinking styles (e.g., Barron et al., 2014 ,2018 ;Dagnall et al., 2015 ;Hart & Graether, 2018 ) and ideas of reference (e.g., Barron et al., 2018 ). Finally, conspiratorial ideation is not only related to schizotypy speci cally but also to tendencies to have unusual experiences at large and seems reasonable given thatschizotypy encompasses broad tendencies to have unusual experi-ences (e.g., Dagnall et al., 2015 ;Stone et al., 2018 ). It should be noted that conspiratorial ideation is not only related to discrete personality disorder s (e.g., schizotypy), but also to a broad personality disorder liability. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (APA, 2013 ) alternative trait model (alternative model of personality disorders), personality disorder traits are organized into ve domains refl ecting the maladaptive extremes of the Big Five (e.g., John & Srivastava, 1999): negative affectivity (e.g., anxiousness,emotional lability), e.g., Krueger et al., 2012 ). Preliminary studies suggest that all ve personality disorder dimensions manifest medium-to-large positive associations withconspiratorial ideation (e.g., Bowes et al., 2021 ;Swami et al., 2016 ). Based on the ndings described thus far, it may seem that conspiratorial ideation is uniquely related to personality disorder traits. Yet, there is a high degree of overlap between personalitydisorder traits and psychopathological features (e.g., bipolardisorder and borderline personality disorder; see Deltito et al., 2001 ;Kotov et al., 2021 ). Moreover, personality dysfunction is as strongly linked to indices of psychopathology as indices ofpersonality disorders (e.g., Sleep et al., 2019 ). Thus, conspiratorial ideation may not be uniquely related to personality disorder traits but, instead, to broad psychopathology liability. Clarifying theextent that conspiratorial ideation bears on psychopathologicalcharacteristics more generally presents many open and interestingquestions. Psychopathological symptoms are often organized along two higher order dimensions: internalizing (e.g., distress, fear, anxiety,depression, low ideation and disorderdimensions (i.e., alternative model of personality disorders traits),conspiratorial ideation is related to a range of internalizing andexternalizing features. Regarding internalizing features, conspirato-rial ideation tends to manifest small positive associations with totalscores on depression symptom inventories (e.g., Bogart et al., 2010 ; Grebe & Nattrass, 2012 ;Leone et al., 2018 ;Rose, 2017 ) and allied negative mood states, including anger and hostility (e.g., Jolley & Paterson, 2020 ;Marchlewska et al., 2019 ). Although no research has examined symptoms of externalizing disorders per se, some research has examined externalizing features in relation toconspiratorial ideation; these st udies indicate that conspiratorial ideation is weakly-to-moderately and positively linked with self- reported physical aggression and a willingness to use violenceagainst others (e.g., Lamberty & Leiser, 2019) in addition to justications of the use of violence (e.g., burning 5th generation mobile network towers to prevent spread of COVID-19; see Jolley & Paterson, 2020 ). Taken together, conspiratorial ideation appears to be related to multiple manifestations of psychopathology. Even still, abnormal-range correlates do not suf ciently account for the fact that conspiratorial ideation is pervasive and perhaps even universal (e.g.,van Prooijen & Douglas, 2018 ). Thus, it is also important to consider normal-range personality in the context of conspiratorial ideation. Normal-Range Personality Correlates Studies examining the associations between conspiratorial ideation and normal-range personality are mixed (e.g., Bowes et al., 2021 ;Brotherton et al., 2013 ;Imhoff & Bruder, 2014 & Halberstadt, 2019 ;Swami & Furnham, 2012 ). Research suggests that the relations between Big Five traits and conspiratorialideation are highly heterogeneous in both magnitude and direction(e.g., the published relations between agreeableness and conspira-torial ideation range from .28, Swami et al. to .11, Orosz et al., 2016 ). Recent meta-analytic examinations of the associations between the Big Five traits and conspiratorial ideation reportedcorrelations that were either weak or Goreis & Voracek, 2019 ;Stasielowicz, 2022 ). Beyond the Big Five, there is a model of general personality (Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, Extraversion, Agreeableness,Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience; HEXACO) the standard Big Five dimensions as wellas a sixth honesty -humility dimension (e.g., greed avoidance, sincerity; see Lee & Ashton, 2018). The HEXACO model of personality is widely used given that it more comprehensivelycaptures personality adjectives cross-culturally than does the BigFive model (e.g., Ashton & Lee, 2008 ). To our knowledge, only two published studies have examined the associations between theHEXACO domains and conspiratorial ideation ( Bowes et al., 2021; Jolley et al., 2019 ). Whereas relations between honesty - humility and conspiratorial ideation were negative and small-to-moderate in magnitude, relations for the other HEXACO domains,which largely align with the Big Five dimensions, wereinconsistent both in terms of their signi cance and direction.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly. 5Features of psychosis (e.g., detachment, thought disorder) are separable from internalizing and externalizing dimensions and tend to load on their own dimension (see Kotov et al., 2021 ).CONSPIRATORIAL IDEATION META-ANALYSIS 7Additional work into the relations between humility and conspiratorial ideation by examining intellectual humility --which is a manifestation of broad humility referring to humility surrounding one 's beliefs, attitudes, and knowledge (e.g., Van Tongeren et al., 2019 )--and its relations with conspiratorial ideation Bowes et al., 2021; Bowes & Tasimi, 2022 ). In these studies, intellectual humility was weakly-to- moderately negatively related to conspiratorial ideation. Inaggregate, it seems that humility is a consistent, negative correlate of conspiratorial ideation. Present Investigation Here, we sought to meta-analytically examine the full body of currently available literature (including peer-reviewed journal articles, dissertations and theses, and unpublished data) on the motivational and personological correlates of conspiratorial ideation. Weaggregated and analyzed 52 variables in relation to conspiratorial ideation. Not only did we want to provide a snapshot of the magnitude of the relations between these motivational and personologicalvariables and conspiratorial ideation, but we also wanted to quantify and examine sources of heterogeneity in these relations. Meta-analysis allows for the identi cation of the boundary conditions driving heterogeneity, a necessary step in validating theories of interest. For example, a substantial degree of heterogeneity in the relation between threat and conspiratorial ideation may suggest that only certain kinds of threats pertain toconspiracy beliefs or that the effect does not generalize to certain populations. Thus, by estimating the degree and sources of substantive heterogeneity in the literature, we can offer newinsights concerning both variables that have been meta-analytically examined in previous research and constructs that have been understudied. What is more, there may be greater variation inconspiratorial ideation relations within motivational domains then there is across motivational domains; to our knowledge, our meta- analysis is the rst to address this issue. To examine sources of heterogeneity, we included a theoreti- cally informed moderator (conspiracy theory type), and we also examined the potential for publication bias. Looking at conspiracy theory type, there are two common ways of assessing people 's beliefs in conspiracy theories within the literature: through measures of speci corgeneral conspiratorial ideation (e.g., Imhoff measures of speci c conspiratorial ideation present a series of concrete, event-based conspiracy theories (e.g., the U.S. government planned the 9/11 attacks to retain power), measures of general conspiratorial ideation presenta series of abstract, decontextualized conspiracy theories (e.g., governments plan to harm their citizens to retain power). Although measures of speci c and general conspiratorial ideation are theoretically similar and tend to be strongly positively interrelated (e.g., Brotherton et al., 2013), there are important differences between these measures. For example, belief in speci c conspiracy theories may be more skewed than belief in general conspiracytheories (see Imhoff et al., 2022 ). Thus, the magnitude of the relations between conspiratorial ideation and motivational and personological constructs may vary across measures of conspira- Halberstadt, 2020).Method Inclusion Criteria and Literature Search To identify candidate studies, we started by searching references from previous meta-analyses on conspiratorial ideation (e.g., Goreis ;Stojanov & Halberstadt, 2020 ). We next broadened our search through electronic databases, speci cally Google Scholar and APA PsycInfo,6using a series of Boolean phrases (e.g., (( \"conspir *theor *OR conspire * belie*OR conspire *idea*) AND open *)). For the complete list of search terms we used, see Supplemental Table S1 .D enitions of and references for motivational and personological constructs included in the meta-analysis are provided in Supplemental Tables S2 and S3 .S e e Figure 1 for an overview of the screening process. We included studies that contained the words \"conspiracy, \" \"conspiratorial, \"or\"epistemically unwarranted beliefs \"and allied constructs (e.g., scienti cally unsubstantiated beliefs) in the title or abstract. We broadened our initial search to include studies referencing epistemically unwarranted beliefs and allied constructs,as conspiracy theories are often discussed and measured in thelarger context of epistemically unwarranted/questionable beliefs(e.g., Lobato et al., 2014 ). Our inclusion criteria also included the following: studies that (a) report an effect size (e.g., Pearson 'sr) and (b) measure a motivational or personological construct via self-report or experimental paradigm (e.g., lab measures of illusorypattern perception). Both published and unpublished (i.e., preprints,theses, data sets) articles were eligible for inclusion. No exclusionswere made based on study population. Articles not written inEnglish were excluded. For studies that used multiple waves, weincluded the correlations within waves (e.g., Wave 1 conspiratorialideation with Wave 1 variable of interest; Wave 2 conspiratorialideation with Wave 2 variable of interest; see Golec de Zavala & Federico, 2018 ). In studies using pre -post designs (e.g., Orosz et al., 2016 ), we included the correlations between baseline levels of conspiratorial ideation and variables of interest at baseline, and wedid not include the correlations between experimentally induced(post) levels of conspiratorial ideation and variables of interest. Thenal search was conducted in February 2022, yielding a total of 3,721 unique results (after repeat titles were removed). Themethods sections of relevant studies were then screened for inclusionto ascertain that both conspiratorial ideation and a relevantmotivational and/or personological construct were directly measured(seeFigure 1 ). We solicited the authors of 80 studies for additional data concerning (a) observations that had not been reported inthe article (i.e., authors reported measuring relevant constructs butdid not report effect sizes in the article or Supplemental Materials )o r (b) additional information that was needed to calculate zero-ordercorrelations (e.g., only semipartial correlations were reported in the article). If authors did not respond, two additional emails were sent. We received 60 email responses (75%), yielding 28 data sets that metour inclusion criteria (47%). Data Coding After removing duplicates and studies that were ineligible for the meta-analysis, we ended up with a total of 170 studiesThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly. 6We searched for studies on COVID-19 conspiracy theories in PsyArXiv and Google Scholar from May 2020 to early 2022.8 BOWES, COSTELLO, AND TASIMI(257 samples, 1,429 effect sizes) that met inclusion criteria. An overview of all included articles, study characteristics, and effect sizes can be found at https://osf.io/jxyfn/ . Pearson 'srcoefcients were coded from each study by the rst author and research assistants. For a variable to be included in the meta-analysis, there must have been at least two effect sizes present across studies for said variable(e.g., Goh et al., 2016 ). Based on inclusion criteria, we coded 52 motivational and personological variables from the eligible studies.In addition to coding these variables, we coded for motivational domain (i.e., epistemic, existential, social) and personologicaldomain (i.e., psychopathology, general/normal-range personality) based on existing frameworks of conspiratorial ideation (e.g., Douglas et al., 2017 ,2019 ;Goreis & Voracek, 2019 ).This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.Figure 1 Flowchart of Screening Process Note. k =number of studies; S=number IDEATION META-ANALYSIS 9Moderators We coded for potential moderators and examined whether these moderators imposed boundary conditions on the relations between conspiratorial ideation and motivational and personologi-cal constructs. 7 Conspiracy Theory Type. As previously noted, endorsement of conspiracy theories is often assessed in two ways: through general conspiracy theories or speci c conspiracy theories. In addition to these approaches, some measures of conspiratorial ideation assess conspiracy stereotypes, meaning that outgroupmembers are perceived as conspirators behind an event, usually due to pervasive stereotypes about said outgroup (e.g., Jewish individuals seek world domination and subvert others to obtaininternational power; see Swami, 2012 ). Moreover, measures of conspiratorial ideation have assessed ctitious conspiracy theories, meaning they are not circulated in public life (e.g., that Red Bulldrinks are carcinogenic and this information is being hidden fromthe public; see Swami et al., 2011 ), and conspiracy scenarios, meaning individuals read about a conspiracy situation (e.g., death of Princess Diana; see Jolley et al., 2019 ). Thus, the following categories were coded: general (effect size =631, k=96), (ES =18,k=8), stereotype (ES =51, k=11), and mixed (e.g., measure contained both general and speci c conspiracies or study authors collapsed across measures of general and speci c conspiracy theories; ES =13,k=3). After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also coded forwhether a measure assessed COVID-19 conspiracy theories speci cally (ES =80,k=19). Post Hoc Moderators. After reviewing the literature, we coded for four additional moderators: type of measure for generalpersonality, intelligence, ef cacy, and trust used in each study. There is substantial variability across self-report measures of broadband personality traits in terms of content coverage of each of the ve dimensions of the Big Five. For instance, the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI; see Gosling et al., 2003 ) assesses each personality dimension with a mere two items, whereas the Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness Personality Inventory - Revised (see Costa & McCrae, 2008 ) assesses each dimension with 48 items. The HEXACO Personality Inventory -Revised (HEXACO PI-R; see Lee & Ashton, 2018 ) assesses six overarching dimensions of personality rather than ve, including modi ed versions of the Big Five traits in addition to honesty -humility. The following measures were coded as categorical ( Costa & McCrae, 2008 ;E S =4,k=1), Big Five Aspects Scale ( DeYoung et al., 2007 ;E S =4,k=1), =6), Samuel et 2013 ;E S=5,k =1), the Big Five Inventory (BFI; 1991 ;E S=76,k=6), the BFI-10 ( Rammstedt & John, 2007 =5,k=1), the Comprehensive Intellectual Humility Scale (CIHS; Krumrei- Mancuso & Rouse, 2016 ;E S =10,k=2), and the General Intellectual Humility (GIHS; Leary et al., 2017 ;E S =10, k=2). There was also signi cant cross-study variation in measures used to assess intelligence. Dimensions or types of intelligence can yielddiffering correlations with various individual difference constructs, including general personality traits (e.g., Reeve et al., 2006 ) and personality disorder traits (e.g., psychopathy; Watts et al., 2016 ). In post hoc analyses, we examined the dimension and type ofintelligence measured as a moderator in the relationship betweenconspiratorial ideation and intelligence. We coded for the following:general intelligence (i.e., total scores on performance-basedmeasures of intelligence; ES =9,k=5), matrix reasoning (ES =1,k=1), and self-reported intelligence (i.e., self-placement on a distribution of percentiles,ES=8,k=4). In addition, we coded for the domain of ef cacy assessed, given that there could be important variability across these domains intheir relations with Similarly, we coded for the domain of trust assessed to examine whether there aredifferences across domains of trust in relation to conspiratorialideation. We coded the following domains of trust: authority ( k=1, ES=2), combined (i.e., multiple forms of trust were combined into a single score; k=2, and science ( k=2, ES =2). All post hoc moderation results are in Supplemental Tables S10 -S13. Data Analytic Plan All analyses were conducted using the metafor package in R (Viechtbauer, 2010 ). Outliers We generated data sets, wherein data were removed at the 95th and 99th percentiles of the distribution of the standardized residuals foreach meta-analytic model. All models were then run using data setswith outliers removed. We note if the results changed (in terms ofstatistical signi cance and/or direction of the effect) when excluding outliers. If the results did not change appreciably after removing outliers, then we retained the full data set for our analyses (the modelswith outliers removed are available at https://osf.io/jxyfn/ ). Main Effects Correlations were transformed using Fisher 'sr-to-ztransforma- tion to normalize the sampling distribution of the Pearson 'sr coefcients ( Silver & Dunlap, 1987 ). Effect sizes were also weighted according to the inverse of their variance (i.e., sampling error) as it is the standard approach in meta-analysis ( Marin- Martinez & S \u00e1nchez-Meca, 2010 ).This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly. 7We additionally coded for the predominate nation in each study (e.g., >50% of the sample comprised participants from said nation), the average age and gender in each sample, the sample composition of each sample, political af liation, the WEIRDness of each sample, and predominate education in each sample. We also coded for the U.S. regionof each sample when such data were available. The descriptive statistics for these constructs are reported in Supplemental Tables S4 and S5 . Moderation results for these variables are available in Supplemental Materials 1, 2, Tables S6, S7, and S16 -S21.10 BOWES, COSTELLO, AND TASIMIWe used a three-level random-effects model with restricted maximum likelihood estimation ( Assink & Wibbelink, 2016 ), modeling the sampling variance for each effect size (Level 1), within-sample variation across outcomes (Level 2), and between-sample variation (Level 3). By accounting for systematic varianceacross outcomes from the same sample, we were better able toaccount for correlated sampling errors (e.g., because of multipleeffect sizes drawn from the same sample; Van den Noortgate et al., 2013 ) than previous (e.g., Goreis & Voracek, 2019 ; Stasielowicz, 2022 ). In total, we calculated 52 meta-analytic models (one for each variable of interest), with ks (studies) ranging from 3 to 40 and Ns (sample size) from 578 to 67,236. Heterogeneity We quanti ed heterogeneity using several approaches. First, Cochrane 'sQstatistic is derived from the Qtest and approximates a2distribution with k1 degrees of freedom. Interpretation of the Qstatistic represents the presence or absence of signi cant between- study heterogeneity. Although the Qstatistic is a useful metric of heterogeneity, it has poor power to detect heterogeneity when the kis small and can be statistically signi cant in the absence of true heterogeneity when the kis large ( Huedo-Medina et al., 2006 ). The I2statistic overcomes some of the Qstatistic 's limitations, as it is a metric of the proportion of total variation in the observed effectthat is due to between-study heterogeneity in the \"true\"effect (Higgins & Thompson, 2002 ). We calculated I 2in Level 2 ( I2 (2)) and Level 3 ( I2 (3)) of the model, to ascertain variation across outcomes within sample and across samples, respectively, relative to the totalvariance. In addition, we calculated H 2(Higgins & Thompson, 2002 ), which re flects the difference between Qand its expected value when heterogeneity is absent. Importantly, H2is not impacted by the number of studies, affording comparisons of heterogeneityacross meta-analytic models. We interpreted H 2values according toHiggins and Thompson 's (2002) benchmarks: H2=1 suggests that the population of studies is homogeneous, whereas H2>1.5 suggests that heterogeneity is present. We also calculated 2 1and22, which describe the within-sample and between-sample variances of the true effect sizes in our data set. Alongside our reporting ofthese variances, we computed the standard deviation of the true effect sizes, , which is calculated as 2 1+22p . Moderator Analyses For categorical moderators, we only included levels of a given moderator variable if there were three or more effect sizes. A single three-level random-effects model was tted to the data with the categorical factor included to model the differences between the subgroups ( Viechtbauer, 2010 ). The intercept was removed to model the effect size for each group. We examined signi cant moderation models based on an omnibus F-test. For models with a signicant omnibus F-test, we next adjudicated whether effect sizes were signi cantly different based on ttests comparing each level of the moderator. Publication Bias We also investigated publication bias (i.e., factors that may limit the representativeness of a set of published studies, such as thestatistical signi cance of the results or the accessibility of the article; see McShane et al., 2016 ) using several analytic strategies. First, we added the standard error or variance for each effect size as a predictor in each meta-analytic model. This analytic approach isclosely linked to the PET-PEESE method used in two-level meta-analyses Stanley & Stanley & Doucouliagos, 2014 ) is a meta-regression technique in which the effect sizes are predicted from their standard errors and weighted according to their precision estimates(seeCarter et al., 2019 ). If PET is signi cant, then it is recommended to follow-up with the precision-effect estimate with standard errortest (PEESE; see Carter et al., 2019 ). PEESE is the same as PET except that the effect sizes are predicted from the squared standarderrors. The intercept of the regression in the PEESE model is theestimated total effect controlling for publication bias ( Stanley & Doucouliagos, 2014 ). Although the performance of PET-PEESE in multilevel meta-analytic models has not yet been adjudicated,some consider it to be one of the best available methods to correctfor publication bias in meta-analysis (e.g., Lehtonen et al., 2018 ). Nevertheless, PET-PEESE can yield unstable estimates if the ks are low and/or if between-study heterogeneity is high ( Carter et al., 2019 ;Stanley, 2017 ). Given these limitations, we also examined whether effect sizes were signi cantly different between published and unpublished results. We created a dichotomous variable (1 = published; 2 =unpublished) and conducted subgroup analyses using the method described earlier for categorical moderators(published ES =1,065, k=146; unpublished ES =364, k=24). 8 Transparency and Openness We followed the Meta Analysis Reporting Standards guidelines for reporting our meta-analytic results ( Appelbaum et al., 2018 ).

Results and forest plots for each construct can also be viewed through the following Shiny app at https://8cz637- thc.shinyapps.io/ConspiracyMetaAnalysis/ . Study Characteristics There were 170 studies, 257 samples, and 1,429 effect sizes included in the present meta-analysis. On average, there were 12 studies, 16 samples, and 27 effect sizes per construct ( Figure 2 ), although it is evident there was considerable heterogeneity in termsof the studies, samples, and effect sizes per construct.

This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly. 8We also created funnel plots depicting the distribution of the effect sizes by their precision (1/ SE). The 95th and 99th percentile con dence intervals are included in the funnel plots to facilitate identi cation of potential outliers (these are available at https://osf.io/jxyfn/ ). Interpreting the magnitude of publication bias from a funnel plot based upon visual inspection alone is subjective and susceptible to error, however, and scholars caution against interpreting funnel plots when effect sizes are signi cantly heterogeneous (Vevea & Woods, 2005 ). Thus, we do not describe these results but refer readers to online materials at https://osf.io/jxyfn/ .CONSPIRATORIAL IDEATION META-ANALYSIS 11outlier for number of studies, samples, and effect sizes was trust (k=40,S=57, ES =100). Studies were conducted between 1994 and 2022 ( M=2017, SD= 3.82). Across constructs, there were 158,473 participants. Of 170studies, 146 ( S=231) were published and 24 ( S=32) were unpublished. Most studies included American participants ( k=77, S=103), followed by participants from the United Kingdom ( k= 23,S=33) and Poland ( k=12,S=19). For studies that reported their recruitment location within the United States, most reportedsampling from the Northeast ( k=5,S=6) or West ( k=4,S=5). Most studies recruited from community samples ( k=117, S=170) followed by student samples ( k=48,S=63). The average age across samples was 32.29 years ( SD=9.82), and the average percentage of females across samples was 56.4% ( SD=15.66). Most studies included participants who identi ed as politically Democratic ( k=9,S=12), and most participants were college educated ( k=86,S=124). Most studies assessed speci c conspiracy theories ( k=103, S=141) or general conspiracy theories ( k=96,S=141); the remaining studies assessed ctitious conspiracy theories ( k=4,S=7), endorsement of conspiracy scenarios ( k=8,S=11), conspiracy stereotypes ( k=11,S=19), or a mixture of both speci c and general conspiracy theories ( k=3, S=5). In addition, 158 studies assessed non-COVID-19 conspiracy theories ( S=242) and 19 assessed COVID-19 conspiracy theories (S=21). Regarding motivational and personological domains assessed across studies, social motives were most frequently assessed ( k=88, S=126), followed general personality traits ( k=33,S=44). Regarding constructs assessed across studies, the most commonly assessedconstruct was trust ( k=40,S=57), followed by Big Five traits (ks ranged from 28 [conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism] to 31 [openness]; Ss range to 41 [openness]), RWA k=27,S=40), self-reported intuition and cognitive re flection ( ks were 23, Ss were 29 and 27), intelligence (k=22,S=26), and anxiety, paranoia, and SDO ( ks were 17, Ss ranged from 22 [SDO] to 25 [anxiety]). Outliers None of the results appreciably changed in terms of statistical signicance or effect size after removing outliers at either the 95th or 99th percentiles of the distribution of effect sizes (mean change in Pearson 'srafter removing outliers was <.01 for both data sets). Hence, we used the full data set for all subsequent analyses. Results from data sets with outliers removed are available at https://osf.io/ jxyfn/ .

Herein, we provide a narrative overview of our ndings; granular details are provided in the main tables. Motivational Correlates Epistemic Conspiratorial ideation was weakly and signi cantly related to less analytical thinking and need for cognition ( rs ranged from .14 [need for cognition] to .17 [cognitive re flection]). Not only was conspiratorial ideation related to less analytical thinking, but it was also weakly-to-moderately related to more reliance on intuition ( rs ranged from .14 [conjunction fallacy] to .26 [bullshit receptivity])and was strongly related to more delusion-proneness ( r=.42). There were also clear links between conspiratorial ideation andpatternicity, with effect sizes ranging from small to large ( rs ranged from .18 [illusory agency detection] to .40 [anthropomorphism]). Consistent with the possibility that conspiratorial ideation may align with motives to maintain one 's views, conspiratorial ideationwas weakly related to more dogmatism ( r=.14) and to less actively open-minded thinking ( r=.25). Conspiratorial ideation was additionally related to motives to identify certainty and avoid complexity (need for closure r=.10; intolerance of ambiguity r=.25). Results indicated that conspirato- rial ideation may also align with low cognitive ability, asconspiratorial ideation was weakly negatively related to intelligence(r=.16). It should be noted that the relationship between intelligence and conspiratorial ideation was signi cantly larger when assessing (a) verbal self-reported level of intelligence, (b) of intelligence, t(29) =2.47, p<.05. Heterogeneity was slightly reduced when accounting for the domain of intelligence assessed ( =.01).

In line with these ndings, conspiratorial ideation was weakly-to-moderately related to more anxiety (anxiety r=.19; death anxiety r=.12) and was weakly, yet signicantly, related to perceiving that one has less control ( r= .17). In contrast, conspiratorial did not signi cantly vary by measure of efcacy after correcting for the false discovery rate ( Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995 ). The population of studies for each construct tended to be heterogeneous ( H2ranged from 3.37 [powerlessness] ( Between-sample heterogeneity to be variation (I2 (3)ranged from <1% [existential threat, belief in a dangerous world, death anxiety] to 25.2% [control]); the exceptions werebelief in a dangerous world, powerlessness, anxiety, and control.The standard deviation in true effects between observations tendedto be smaller than the magnitude of the effect sizes, with theexceptions of related to constructs pertaining to feeling misunderstood by society and feeling isolated, as it wasstrongly associated with more anomie ( r=.34), less trust ( r=.26), and more alienation ( r=.28); nevertheless, the latter relationship was not signi cant. The relations between trust and conspiratorial ideation did not signi cantly differ across domains of trust. There was also evidence that conspiratorial ideation is related toa fragile sense-of-self, as it was weakly related to less individualself-esteem ( r=.09), moderately related to more individual narcissism ( r=.22), and weakly related to more need for uniqueness (r=.16).

Heterogeneity reduced when accounting for personality measure ( =.01). Humility was a signi cant, albeit small, negative correlate of conspiratorial ideation, meaning conspiratorial ideation was related to less humility ( r=.15). The population of studies for humility was heterogeneous ( H 2=3.91). Between-sample heterogeneity was small relative to within-sample variation ( I2 (3)<1%), and the standard deviation in true effects between observations did notexceed the magnitude of the effect size ( =.05) Personality measure signi cantly moderated the relationship between humility and conspiratorial ideation such that the relationship wassignicantly larger when using the (a) HEXACO PI-R assesses the intrapersonal features of intellectual humility, and (b) the CIHS(b=.22; assesses emotional, interpersonal, and intrapersonal features of intellectual humility) than the GIHS, t(31) =5.42,p<.001. Heterogeneity was slightly reduced when accounting for personality measure ( =.02). Personological Variables: Interim Summary In sum, conspiratorial ideation was strongly related to all indices of psychopathology, spanning internalizing, externalizing, and personality disorder traits. In contrast, the correlations betweenconspiratorial ideation and general personality traits were less-than-small ( rs<.10). The exception was humility, including both honesty -humility and intellectual humility, as it was a small-to- moderate and negative correlate of conspiratorial ideation.

Motivational Epistemic Conspiracy Theory Type. Conspiracy theory type signi - cantly moderated the relations between conspiratorial ideation and (a) cognitive re flection, (b) illusory pattern perception, (c) actively open-minded thinking, and (d) need for closure. Cognitivereflection was a stronger correlate of belief in speci c conspiracy theories ( b=.19) than general conspiracy theories, b=.14; t(37)=2.37, p<.05. Similarly, actively open-minded thinking was a stronger correlate of belief in speci c conspiracy theories ( b= .27) than general conspiracy theories, b=.17;t(12) =3.02, p< .05.

Conspiracy theory type signi - cantly moderated the relations between conspiratorial (b) individual narcissism, (c) collective narcissism, threat perception, (e) RWA, and (f) SDO. The conspiracytheory type variable moderated the relations between conspiratorialideation and (a) anomie, (b) collective narcissism, (c) social threatperception, (d) RWA, and (e) SDO such that the relations werestronger when using measures of speci c(bs ranged from .25 [SDO] to .67 [social threat]) than general ( bs ranged from .14 [SDO] to .29 [anomie]) conspiracy to [RWA], ps<.05).

Similarly, the relationship between conspiratorial ideation and SDO was signicantly stronger when using measures of conspiracy stereo- types ( b=.53) than measures of general conspiracy theories 4.94 and 3.38, dfs were 38, ps< .01). The COVID-19 variable also moderated the relation between conspiratorial ideation and SDO, such that the relation was stronger when using measures of COVID-19 ( b=.42) conspiracy theories than non-COVID-19 ( =2.78, p<.01. By and large, heterogeneity was slightly reduced when accounting for conspiracy theory type in the aforementionedrelationships ( ranged from .00 [individual narcissism, RWA] to .02 [anomie]).

Nevertheless, for SDO, heterogeneity was largely unchanged when accounting forthe COVID-19 variable ( =.00). Publication Bias. There was little evidence for publication bias when examining publication status as a moderator. In fact, publication status signi cantly moderated the relation between conspiratorial ideation and RWA such that the relation was stronger in unpublished ( b=.30) than in published ( b=.19) studies, t(64) =2.03, p<.05. Heterogeneity was slightly reduced when accounting for publication status in these relations ( =.01). Nonetheless, the PET test was signi cant for alienation and SDO (ps<.05).

General/Normal-Range Personality Conspiracy Theory Type.

In addition, the COVID-19 variable signi cantly moderated the relationship between conspira- torial ideation and openness. The relationship between openness and conspiratorial ideation was signi cantly larger when using measures of conspiracy theories ( b=.16) compared with non-COVID-19 ( b=.03) conspiracy theories, .01. Even still, heterogeneity was largely unchanged whenaccounting for the conspiracy theory type and COVID-19 variablesin these relations ( =.00). Publication Bias. There were no signi cant results for the publication bias analyses. Domain-Level Analyses Meta-Analytic Correlations and Heterogeneity To clarify whether relations were consistent across variables within domain, we also conducted domain-level analyses. To do so, we treated the individual variables, samples, and their interaction(variable-by-sample) as random effects within the broader domain;effect sizes were modeled as xed effects. This modeling allowed us to calculate the average meta-analytic correlation withindomains. We did not examine general personality at the domain-level, given that there is no interpretable \"general personality factor \"in the literature. All variables within each domain were coded in the same direction. For instance, in the epistemic domain,measures of rational thinking, intelligence, and open-mindedthinking were recoded to re flectlowrational thinking, intelligence, and open-minded thinking. Across domains, the correlations weremedium, positive, and signi cant ( Table 7 ,Figure 6 ). Thus, epistemic, existential, social, and psychopathology domains weremoderately related to more conspiratorial ideation. Heterogeneitywithin each of the domains was large ( H 2ranged from 9.06 [epistemic] to 22.22 [existential]).11 Moderation Results First, turning to motivations, conspiracy theory type signi cantly moderated the relations between (a) the existential domain and conspiratorial ideation and (b) the social domain and conspiratorialideation. Regarding the existential domain, the relations betweenconspiratorial ideation and the existential domain were signi cantly smaller for measures that assessed a mix of conspiracy theories (b=.08) than for measures of conspiracy stereotypes, b=.30; t(182) =2.22, p<.05. Regarding the social domain, the relations between conspiratorial ideation and the social domain were signicantly larger for conspiracy stereotypes ( b=.46) than for other measures of conspiratorial ideation ( bs ranged from .14 [scenario] ps<.01). Moreover, the relations between conspiratorial ideation and the social domain were larger forspecic conspiracy theories ( b=.25) than for general conspiracy theories, b=.20;t(349) =2.92, p<.01. Neither the publication status moderation results nor the PET-PEESE results weresignicant for the motivational domains. Regarding the psychopathology domain, conspiracy theory type and publication status signi cantly moderated the relations between the psychopathology domain and conspiratorial ideation. Turning to conspiracy theory type, the relations betweenconspiratorial ideation and the psychopathology domain weresignicantly stronger for conspiracy stereotypes ( b=.55) than other conspiracy theory measures ( bs were .32 [general] and the relations between conspiratorial ideation and the psychopathology domain were stronger for general .32) than speci c(b=.26) conspiracy theories, t(172) =3.38, p< .001. There was also some evidence for publication bias, as conspiratorial ideation was more strongly related to the psychopa- thology domain in published ( b=.21) studies, t(179) =2.29, p<.05. Discussion The present investigation, which spanned 170 studies, 257 samples, 52 variables, 1,429 effect sizes, and 158,473 participants,claries the motivational and personological correlates of conspira- torial ideation (and their magnitude), quanti es the degree of substantive differences across these constructs, and sheds light onmoderators that may account for said differences. Overall, this workholds the potential to inform our understanding of conspiratorialideation and chart useful paths forward for future research,especially when it comes to bridging motivation with personality.Below, we summarize our ndings and adopt a forward-looking perspective concerning the remarkably vast and rich pattern ofpsychological phenomena associated with conspiratorial ideation. Motivational Correlates: Considering Epistemic, Existential, and Social Motives Our meta-analytic results largely support the tripartite motiva- tional model of conspiratorial ideation (see Douglas et al., 2017 ). Of 34 epistemic, existential, and social variables, 31 (91%) were signicantly related to conspiratorial ideation (see Table 3 and Figure 4 ). Moreover, at the domain-level of analysis, the epistemic, existential, and social motivational domains were all medium correlates of more conspiratorial ideation. These ndings suggest that a deprivation of these motivational domains --broadly construed --is related to more conspiratorial ideation. Overall, the results corroborate the tripartite model 's core hypothesis that (a) a need to understand one 's environment, (b) a need to feel secure and safe in one 's environment, and (c) a need to maintain a superior, but fragile, image of oneself and one 's ingroup predict conspiratorial ideation when these needs are deprived. Consistent with other research ( Biddlestone et al., 2022 ), our ndings reveal that motivations at large are important, perhaps even essential,pieces of the conspiratorial ideation puzzle.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly. 11The statistical signi cance of the main effects and moderation results for the domain-level analyses were unchanged after employing a Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) correction for multiple comparisons.CONSPIRATORIAL IDEATION META-ANALYSIS results from our preprint (Biddlestone et al., 2022 ) indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity (and perhaps even statistical uncertainty; see Biddlestone et al., 2022 ) in effect sizes within these motivational domains. At the domain-level, heterogeneity statistics were exceedingly large, and, at the variable-level, effect sizes within domain often ranged from small and not signi cant to large and signi cant. Hence, by lumping these constructs together, we may lose important information about these granular relations. Results from this meta-analysis suggest that getting an overall \"quick-and-dirty \"snapshot of the domain-level relations is less informative than a granular and more complex portrait of thevariable-level relations. Similarly, considering Meehl 's (1990) observation that nearly all psychological constructs are interrelated to some degree even in the absence of a meaningful connection (i.e., a \"crud factor \"), statistical signi cance does not shed light on the meaning or substance of relations in adequately poweredmeta-analyses. Hence, burrowing into the details, as we do below, may be necessary to glean actionable insights concerning the network and strength of interrelations between conspiratorialideation and motivation. Of the three motivational domains delineated in the tripartite motivational framework, the social domain was the best supportedin terms of the magnitude of effect sizes across variables. Therelations between social motives and conspiratorial ideation tendedto be medium-to-large, except for individual self-esteem, which was a small, negative correlate of conspiratorial ideation. These results collectively indicate that conspiratorial ideation is linkedto perceiving that one 's group is superior to outgroups and that outgroups are threatening or immoral. It also seems thatconspiratorial ideation is uniquely related to viewing one 's ingroup in an overly positive light rather than viewing one 's ingroup in a positive light \u2014after all, conspiratorial ideation was not signicantly related to collective self-esteem. The relationship between conspiratorial ideation and collective self-esteem, however, was moderate, so additional research should disentangle feeling positively toward one 's ingroup from feeling that one 's ingroup is superior in the context of conspiratorial ideation. What is more, the two largest correlations between conspiratorial ideation and any of the motivational constructs assessed in ourmeta-analysis were in the social domain. Trust was the largest negative correlate of conspiratorial ideation and social threat perception was the largest positive correlate. These two constructs have not yet been directly meta-analytically investigated, and our results illuminate their importance in the context of conspiratorialideation. The correlation between social threat perception and conspiratorial ideation was greater than the relation between existential threat perception and conspiratorial ideation by >.20.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

Correlations were coded to be in the same direction within each domain. 21=sample; 22=outcome; 23=Sample \u00d7Outcome; 24=effect relationship between conspiratorial ideation and trust was consistent across different manifestations of trust,which speaks to the robustness of this relationship. What trust (orlack thereof) and social threat perception share is a decreasedlikelihood to view others as having good intentions. Based onthese results, it may be worthwhile to directly target theseconstructs in future research using experiments manipulating trustand social threat perception to investigate their causal in fluence on conspiratorial ideation. Studies employing intensive longitudi-nal designs should also be used to identify mechanisms andextend experimental ndings to everyday, naturalistic settings (e.g., Diener et al., 2022 ). In contrast with the social motivational domain, there was mixed support for the epistemic and existential motivationaldomains, as most of the effect sizes in these domains were smallin the present study ( rs<.20; 53% of epistemic results and 50% of existential results) and in a recent preprint ( Biddlestone et al., 2022 ). Given the centrality of epistemic and existential motives to scholarly and popular explanations for conspiratorial individuals (e.g., need for closure: \"people desire certainty \"; need for control: \"people desire personal control \"), the fact that most effect sizes for epistemic and existential motives were small is surprising. One interpretation of our ndings is that epistemic and existential motives are less explanatorily unique than previous theorizingsuggests; this interpretation raises the possibility that such motivesdo not necessarily drive most conspiracy theorists. Idiographic-longitudinal approaches, such as experience sampling methods(e.g., Beck & Jackson, 2021 ) in addition to intensive longitudinal approaches (e.g., Diener et al., 2022 ), may be well-suited to address this possibility in future research. These approaches can shine alight on the moment-to-moment and long-term relations betweenmotives and conspiratorial ideation. Among the smallest epistemic correlations was illusory or hypersensitive agency detection; hypersensitive agency detectionaccounted for roughly 3.5% of the variance in conspiratorialideation across studies. Conspiracy theories entail unsupportedattributions of purpose, agency, and intentionality by de nition (Douglas et al., 2016 ). Notwithstanding the possibility that this weak result may be due to inconsistent measurement practices(Brotherton & French, 2015 ;Douglas et al., 2016 ;Hart & Graether, 2018 ), this is a surprisingly small effect. Understanding the mismatch between theory and evidence found for agency detection(and epistemic and existential motives, more broadly) is a keyavenue for future research. A similar pattern emerged for analytic thinking, need for closure, need for control, and anxiety. These variables are often theorizedto be foundational to conspiratorial ideation and erroneous beliefs atlarge (e.g., Denovan et al., 2020 ;Douglas et al., 2017 ;Marchlewska et al., 2018 ;Swami et al., 2014 ). Yet, analytic thinking, need for closure, need for control, and anxiety were all small correlates ofconspiratorial ideation; these relations were smaller than expectedgiven the hypothesized theoretical import of these variables. Smalleffect sizes, however, should not be equated with a lack of predictiveutility. To ascertain whether these small effect sizes are causallyconnected to conspiratorial ideation and its consequences, futureresearch should continue to probe boundary conditions, contextualfactors, and statistical interactions among variables that maycontribute to stronger effects (see G\u00f6tz et al., 2022 ). For example, lower levels of rational thinking coupled with higher levels of needfor closure may be a stronger predictor of more conspiratorialideation compared with either low levels of rational thinking orlow levels of need for closure in isolation. Along these lines, it is also worth observing that complex and uncertain situations appear to breed conspiratorial thinking (see Marchlewska et al., 2017). Although some individuals faced withuncertainty may turn to conspiracies to slake their need forclosure, others may seek out conspiracies and even nd them to have an inherent entertainment value (e.g., van Prooijen et al., 2022 ). Perhaps there may be a paradox in these relations, such that conspiracy theorists may not be as motivated to nd closure but, instead, are more motivated to nd the secret \"truth \"(e.g., as can be reflected in the narratives of individuals who subscribe to Qanon; seeRoose, 2021 ). By the same token, conspiracy theories may foster loss of control and anxiety, rather than assuaging them, ultimately forming a self-reinforcing system that crystallizes into a conspiracy mindset or worldview ( van Prooijen, 2018 ). Were this the case, the relationship between both control and anxiety and conspiratorial ideation may (a) initially be small but grow strongerover time and (b) scale nonlinearly, such that the most extremeconspiracists will disproportionately score high in perceived lossof control and anxiety. Longitudinal research provides some evidence that intolerance of uncertainty both precedes and follows conspiratorial ideation(e.g., endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories), suggestingthat conspiracy theories do not satisfy this epistemic motive, and,if anything, increase it; there was also some evidence thatconspiratorial ideation predicted increases in existential motives,namely anxiety and existential threat sensitivity (e.g., Liekefett et al., 2023 ). In this study, however, anxiety and existential threat sensitivity did not precede conspiratorial ideation. Additionalresearch is needed to examine the longitudinal relations betweenconspiratorial ideation and epistemic, existential, and social motivesto tease apart what rst draws individuals to conspiracy theories (e.g., people turn to conspiracy theories to lessen anxiety) and whatis left unsatis ed by conspiracy theories (e.g., people feel more anxious when turning to conspiracy theories). Such research canultimately shed light on the psychological factors that causeconspiratorial ideation. Given that most epistemic and existential motives were small correlates of conspiratorial ideation, it is worth highlighting themotives within these domains that were strong correlates. Epistemicmotives pertaining to more reliance on intuition, having oddbeliefs and seeing patterns in their absence, anthropomorphizing,low open-mindedness, and more intolerance of ambiguity weremedium-to-large correlates of conspiratorial ideation. Existentialmotives pertaining to believing the world is dangerous, perceivingexistential threat, viewing the world with cynicism, and feelingpowerless were medium-to-large correlates of conspiratorial ideation. These results were also found to be relatively strong in a preprint ( Biddlestone et al., 2022 ). Given that these results replicated, they may be especially robust and important toinvestigate in future research. All in all, our variable-level ndings and the heterogeneity in these ndings demonstrate the importance of developing a better understanding of whether and how these motivational variableshang together. To evaluate meaningful domain-level relations, itwill be necessary to parse the broad tripartite domains intosubdomains using factor analytic methods or person-centeredThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

Such approaches would allow for testable predictions to be generated about the causal in fluence of motives on conspiratorial ideation and will inform the extent that these individual variables belong together. Personological Correlates: Considering Abnormal-Range and Normal-Range Traits Broadly, we found that conspiratorial ideation was strongly related to abnormal-range traits, whereas it was weakly or not signicantly related to normal-range traits. Conspiratorial ideation has long been thought to be abnormal in nature, that is, as re flecting a belief system of the paranoid, unusual, and extreme members of society (e.g., Hofstadter, 1964 ). Research over the last two decades supports these longstanding conjectures, as several studies indicate that conspiratorial ideationis linked to personality disorder traits in addition to broadpsychopathology liability (e.g., Bowes et al., 2021 ;Georgiou et al., 2019 ). Results from our meta-analysis were consistent with results from these individual studies and previous meta-analyses(e.g., Stasielowicz, 2022 ) and further corroborated historical disorder traitsand indices of psychopathology, including features, were robust and powerful predictors ofconspiratorial ideation, and effect sizes tended to be medium-to-large (see Table 4 andFigure 5 ). Given the number of pathological traits and that bear on conspiratorial ideation, individualsprone to conspiratorial ideation are more likely to be insecure,emotionally labile, suspicious of others, withdrawn, manipulative,callous, irresponsible, impulsive, egocentric, and eccentric. Sup-porting this possibility, at the domain-level, psychopathologywas a strong correlate of more conspiratorial ideation. Yet, withthe motivational domains, there was inthe domain-level relation between psychopathology and conspira-torial ideation, indicating that a more ne-grained discussion of ourndings is warranted. The strongest abnormal-range correlates of conspiratorial ideation were schizotypy, paranoia, tendencies to have unusualexperiences, trait psychoticism, and hostility. These constructscollectively pertain to perceiving that other people harbormalintent toward oneself, having odd perceptual and cognitiveexperiences, and perceiving that events have a special meaning for oneself. Previous research has found that there is considerable overlap between paranoia and conspiratorial ideation regardingtheir psychological correlates (e.g., authoritarianism, need foruniqueness), but are also points of divergence; speci cally, conspiratorial ideation is a stronger predictor of distrusting powerful people than paranoia whereas paranoia is a stronger p r e d i c t o ro fd i s t r u s t i n g everyone than conspiratorial ideation (Imhoff & Lamberty, 2018 ). Moreover, conspiratorial ideation pertains to perceiving threat against oneself and everyone else whereas paranoia pertains to perceiving threat against oneself largely in isolation (Imhoff & Lamberty, 2018 ). Given the strong meta-analytic relations between conspiratorial ideation and paranoia and related variables, future research is needed to identify whatmechanisms contribute to their overlap and what mechanismscontribute to their points of divergence. In broad strokes, the smallest abnormal-range correlates of conspiratorial ideation were physical aggression and features ofinternalizing, including depression and anger. As with anxiety, it is possible that people susceptible to internalizing features turn toconspiracy theories to mitigate their negative and uncomfortableemotions; long-term, however, conspiracy theories are unlikelyto lessen internalizing features and, instead, they may potentiatethem and contribute to people feeling more depressed and angriertoward others (e.g., Douglas et al., 2017 ;Liekefett et al., 2023 ). Considering these possibilities, it is apparent that there is overlapbetween motivational and personological variables in terms ofunresolved questions regarding the antecedents and consequencesof conspiratorial ideation. Although abnormal-range constructs tended to be robust correlates of conspiratorial ideation, we found little evidence thatnormal-range personality constructs were signi cantly related to conspiratorial ideation (see Table 4 and Figure 5 ). Instead, conspiratorial ideation appears to be a somewhat speci c marker of psychopathology rather than normal-range functioning. Whilemost personality traits were signi cantly related to conspiratorial ideation (5 of 6 traits, 83%), effect sizes tended to be very small ( rs<.10). Our results concerning normal personality broadly aligned with results from previous meta-analyses of the relations between Big Five traits and ( Goreis normal-range personality and conspiratorial ideation may be surprising given the strong overlap between Big Fivetraits and Personality Inventory for DSM-5 traits (e.g., Grifn& Samuel, 2014 ). Yet, Personality Inventory for DSM-5 traits better capture the extremes of normal-range traits and are more closelylinked to impaired functioning than Big Five traits (e.g., Simms & Calabrese, 2016 ); thus, what distinguishes normal-range personality from abnormal-range personality is the extent that people areimpaired in their functioning, perceive or have poor quality of life,and feel dissatis ed with their lot in life. It follows that the modal conspiracy theorist may be impaired in their functioning, feeldissatis ed with life, and experience more interpersonal distress. Whereas Big Five traits were weak correlates of conspiratorial ideation, both general humility and intellectual humility were small-to-medium, negative, and signi cant correlates of conspiratorial ideation. These results were particularly strong when measuringhonesty -humility and measuring comprehensive features of intel- lectual humility. Previous research had not meta-analyticallyexamined humility in relation to conspiratorial ideation, and ourndings suggest that it has been an overlooked correlate. It seems that, in the general personality space, less humility may be thestrongest correlate of more conspiratorial ideation. These resultsalso align with other ndings in the abnormal-range and motivational domains \u2014personality disorder traits and narcissism (which are characterized by low humility) were medium-to-large correlates of more conspiratorial ideation. Thus, low humility at large may be a marker of conspiratorial ideation. Although domain-general traits were generally small correlates of conspiratorial ideation, it is important to clarify that is not possible to de nitively conclude that general personality traits are irrelevant to the psychology of conspiratorial ideation based on this meta-analysis. Only general personality domains have been meta-analytically examined in relation to conspiratorial ideation (e.g., Goreis & Voracek, 2019 ;Stasielowicz, 2022 ). Just as with the motivational domains, general personality domains re flect lumping. When splitting these domains into facets there areThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

There are even important differences across items within personality measures inrelation to outcomes of interest (see M\u00f5ttus et al., 2020 ). As such, it will be essential for future research to consider general personality from different levels of analysis. Through this approach, it willbe possible to conclude the predictive strength of general personalitymore de nitively in relation to conspiratorial ideation. Moderation Results As described earlier, the relations between conspiratorial ideation and motivational and personological constructs tended to behighly heterogeneous. Below, we summarize the broad patternof moderation results. Conspiracy Theory Type Of 44 analyses, there were 14 results (32%) indicating that there were signi cant differences between the types of conspiracy theories assessed (see Supplemental Tables S8 and S9). In general, these moderation results indicated that belief in speci c conspiracy theories and conspiracy stereotypes were stronger correlates ofmotivational and personological constructs than belief in generalconspiracy theories, which is broadly consistent with previouswork (e.g., Stojanov & Halberstadt, 2020 ). The following constructs were stronger correlates of belief in specic conspiracy theories than general conspiracy theories: cognitive re flection, actively open-minded thinking, anomie, collective narcissism, social threat perception, RWA, SDO,extraversion, and the social motivational domain. Yet, heteroge-neity was largely unchanged when accounting for conspiracytheory type in most of these relations, so we are hesitant to overlyinterpret these ndings. The exceptions were for actively open- minded thinking, collective narcissism, and social threat percep-tion, as heterogeneity was modestly to moderately reduced whenaccounting for conspiracy theory type for these variables. Theselatter ndings raise the possibility that closemindedness and certain social motives may contribute to individuals latching onto speci c conspiracy theories, perhaps those that are relevant to ingroup -outgroup discord, rather than abstract conspiratorial ideas. Nevertheless, the relations between need for closure, belief in a dangerous world, individual narcissism, paranoia, and the psycho- pathology domain and conspiratorial ideation were signi cantly larger when using measures of general than speci c conspiracy theories. Heterogeneity was largely unchanged when accounting for conspiracy theory type for narcissism, but it was slightly tomoderately reduced for other variables. Overall, these resultsraise the possibility that desiring certainty, perceiving the worldis dangerous, and scoring higher on psychopathology at large,especially paranoia, contribute to a general conspiracy mindset;in contrast, group-level social motives may contribute to endorse-ment of speci c conspiracy theories (as described earlier). These interpretations broadly map onto a recent theoretical frameworkadvancing that social identity motives give rise to endorsement ofspecic conspiracy theories, whereas desiring to be unique may give rise to a general conspiracy mindset; in other words, social identitymotives may give rise to being drawn to the content of a conspiracy theory, whereas more general uniqueness motives may give riseto being drawn to the quality of a conspiracy theory (see Sternisko et al., 2020 ). Turning to conspiracy stereotypes, the following constructs were stronger correlates of belief in conspiracy stereotypes than otherconspiracy theory measures: control, collective narcissism, SDO,paranoia, the social motivational domain, and the psychopathologydomain. Heterogeneity tended to be slightly to moderately reducedin these relations when accounting for conspiracy theory type.These results suggest that lower perceived control, higher levelsof a range of social motives, and higher levels of paranoia andpsychopathology writ large are especially strong correlates ofendorsing conspiracy stereotypes. Regarding control, a previousmeta-analysis also found signi cant differences between measures of conspiratorial ideation for control, with relations being larger for specic than general conspiracy theories ( Stojanov & Halberstadt, 2020 ). Although we found evidence that belief in speci c conspiracy theories was the weakest correlate of control, belief in conspiracy stereotypes, which is a manifestation of belief in speci c conspiracy theories, was the strongest correlate of control, thus aligning with previous research ( Stojanov & Halberstadt, 2020 ). There was additionally some evidence that motivational and personological variables, speci cally cognitive re flection, SDO, and openness, were stronger correlates of belief in COVID-19conspiracy theories than non-COVID-19 conspiracy theories(Supplemental Tables S8 and S9 ). Cognitive re flection and openness were small-to-medium negative correlates of belief inCOVID-19 conspiracy theories, whereas SDO was a strong positivecorrelate of belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories. That said,heterogeneity was largely unchanged when accounting for theCOVID-19 variable in these relations, indicating that the differencesacross levels of the variable may not be theoretically important.Future research should clarify whether there are speci c COVID-19 conspiracy theories, such as those that ascribe blame to outgroupmembers (e.g., Chinese government, immigrants), that may bestrongly related to motivational and personological variables in atheoretically and empirically important manner. Publication Bias In general, there was limited evidence for publication bias (Supplemental Tables S14 and S15 ). Regarding PET-PEESE analyses, just six PET tests were signi cant. Of the six signi cant PET tests, only three PEESE tests were signi cant (cognitive reflection, paranoia, and the psychopathology domain). The remaining three results were not statistically signi cant in the PEESE test (susceptibility to the conjunction fallacy, alienation, andSDO). There was also scant evidence for publication bias whenexamining publication status as a moderator in the relations betweenconspiratorial ideation and motivational and personological con-structs. In fact, only the relations between paranoia and thepsychopathology domain and conspiratorial ideation were signi - cantly larger in published than in unpublished studies. Limitations Although our meta-analysis represents the most comprehensive quantitative review on the psychology of conspiratorial ideation toThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.CONSPIRATORIAL IDEATION META-ANALYSIS 25date, there are several limitations that should be considered when evaluating our ndings. First, statistical power was a limiting factor in the current investigation. Certain variables were assessedin just a few studies with a limited number of effect sizes compared with other constructs (e.g., alienation was assessed in just three studies, whereas trust was assessed in 40 studies). Thus, the power to detect a main effect let alone a statistical interaction with a moderator or meaningful subgroup differences was low forseveral variables. Similarly, given that we assessed 52 individual differences variables, we did not have suf cient power to examine interactions among moderators or variables in the statistical prediction of conspiratorial ideation. Because of how many variables were included, we also encourage readers to be mindful of effect sizes rather than signi cance. As already noted, it is likely that most constructs will be signi cantly related to some degree to conspiratorial ideation, \u00e0laMeehl 's (1990) \"crud factor, \"so effect size is an arguably more important marker of robustness than statistical signi cance here. Second, a problem characteristic of most (if not all) meta-analyses is the limitation of correlated error variance across studies. In essence, error may not be independent across studies, and the sources of heterogeneity may be correlated across studies. Conspiratorial ideation is nearly invariably assessed via self- report, and most motivational and personological correlates are also assessed via self-report. Thus, signi cant correlations may arise due to mono-method correlating self-report with self-report. Similarly, response styles on self-report measures, poor reliability or validity of self-report measures, and other sources of measure- ment error may systematically in fluence the results (see Wiernik & Dahlke, 2020 ). In addition to measurement error, sampling error can in fluence meta-analytic results. Restriction of range in various samples, meaning individuals not particularly prone to conspiratorial ideation were represented, will attenuate the meta-analytic relations, skew results, and perhaps not generalize to samples with passionateconspiracy theorists (see Wiernik & Dahlke, 2020 ). In subsidiary analyses, we probed into this possibility of restriction of rangeby examining sample type and education level as moderators (with restriction of range potentially being higher in college samples and more educated samples); overall, there was some, albeit limited, evidence that the relations were stronger in community samples than in college samples (see Supplemental Tables S16 and S17 ), and there were essentially no differences between education levels in the examined relations (see Supplemental Tables S20 and S21 ). Research is needed to replicate these ndings and consider other methods of examining range restriction at themeasurement level within samples. Our results may also be susceptible to mono-language bias. Our literature search was, by necessity, limited to studies publishedin the English language. As such, our results are only representative of research conducted by or published by those who speak English, limiting the generalizability of the ndings. Similarly, most studies recruited participants in WEIRD populations (29 times more effect sizes for WEIRD than non-WEIRD samples); this acronym refers to the extent that a culture is Westernized, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic ( Klein et al., 2018 ). More specically, most studies included American participants ( k=78), so it remains unclear whether and to what extent the currentndings generalize to non-WEIRD populations and even non- American participants (see also Pilch et al., 2023 ). Research is just beginning to scratch the surface on the relations between cultural variables and conspiratorial ideation. Although there is little evidence to suggest that conspiratorial ideationvaries meaningfully across speci c nations (Goreis & Voracek, 2019 ;Stasielowicz, 2022 ), research points to the possibility that conspiratorial ideation may systematically vary across cultural characteristics (e.g., Adam-Troian et al., 2021 ;Biddlestone et al., 2020 ;van Prooijen & Song, 2021 ). Certain values, such as power distance values (i.e., the extent that people value/accept powerdistributions), are positively related to conspiratorial ideationacross nations Song, 2021 ). WEIRDness has been found to statistically moderate the relations between personological variables and politicalbeliefs (e.g., Alper & Yilmaz, 2019 ), raising the possibility that WEIRDness in fluences the ways that psychological variables predict beliefs at large, including conspiracy beliefs. Thus, researchis needed to study conspiratorial ideation in non-WEIRDpopulations in addition to measuring cultural characteristics inrelation to conspiratorial ideation. Finally, our results do not shed light on causality or temporal precedence in these relations. Instead, our results illustrate thestrength of the cross-sectional relations between conspiratorialideation and motivational and personological constructs. Itremains unclear whether motivational and personological constructsprecede conspiratorial ideation or whether they are cooccurringphenomena. Preliminary work indicates that anxiety and existentialthreat sensitivity do not predict increases in conspiratorial ideationover time, although there was some evidence that intoleranceof uncertainty predicted increases in conspiratorial ideation(Liekefett et al., 2023 ). Additional longitudinal research is warranted to ascertain whether and how certain motivational needsand traits precede conspiratorial ideation. If there is a paucity ofrobust longitudinal relations, then theory surrounding the onsetof conspiratorial ideation will need to be revised. Similarly,additional experimental research that manipulates motivations,specically research that inculcates a short-term deprivation of certain motivational needs, is needed to clarify whether the tripartitemotivational model bears causal implications for conspiratorialideation. Toward a Uni ed Account of Conspiratorial Ideation We see our meta-analysis as providing an empirical \"one-stop- shop \"that will, hopefully, motivate additional research on the conspiratorial mind. Results from our meta-analysis point to a general takeaway: many motivational and germane to conspiratorial some much more germane to it thanothers. Despite the heterogeneity in our ndings, there were some consistent and noteworthy patterns in the results. Because we included both motivational and personological correlates, we wereable to distill our ndings to broad themes that cut across domains. The strongest correlates of conspiratorial ideation across the motivational and personological domains pertained to the followingtendencies: (a) to perceive threat and danger, (b) to rely on intuitionand have odd beliefs and experiences, and (c) to be antagonisticand feel superior (see Figure 7 ). We view these ndings as providingThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

Indeed, these results provide a roadmap for asking more integrative and targetedquestions in the service of understanding the psychology ofconspiratorial ideation. As of now, scant research has investigatedthese constructs simultaneously to assess whether and how theymay come together to give rise to conspiratorial ideation. Below, wedescribe some promising ways that scholars can leverage our results to answer pressing questions about the psychology of conspiratorial ideation. First, we hope that our ndings will inspire research that would link motivation and personality within the context of conspiratorialideation. To illustrate this point, consider one model that maintainsthat personality may be born out of motivation ( Dweck, 2017 ). Under this model, people come into the world with fundamentalneeds to predict their environment, feel accepted, and build competence. Over time and with different experiences, people develop different mental models for pursuing goals, form differentgoals, and then pursue these goals in unique ways (see also Tasimi, 2020 ). Personality traits, then, represent recurrent, stable individual differences in the development and pursuit of goal-relevantexperiences. To make persuasive claims about the origins ofconspiratorial ideation, it will be important to move beyond a single construct of interest, and, instead, draw from such rich developmental models to understand the broader psychology ofconspiratorial ideation. As an example, consider how needs for safety may unfold (and ultimately give rise to) conspiratorial ideation (see also Duckitt & Sibley, 2009 ). Deprived needs for safety (e.g., growing up in an unstable home environment) may lead people to pursue sets of goalsrelated to preserving safety and watching out for others; this may lead them to notice dangers in their environment and come to believe that the world is dangerous (falling under \"threat and danger\" inFigure 7 ). These beliefs and goals may interact witheach other and coalesce into trait-level psychopathologicalprocesses, such as paranoia. Over time, the feedback loops amongthese motives and traits may beget conspiratorial ideation,particularly when considering certain social contexts (e.g., peersalso share similar motives and traits), life experiences (e.g.,experiences that reinforce that people are dangerous), informationsources, and deprived or thwarted motives (e.g., societal events that have devastating consequences). Future research along these lines is needed to understand how different developmentaltrajectories give rise to conspiratorial ideation. Such research will not only clarify how conspiratorial ideation develops but also whether conspiratorial ideation satis es the needs that draw people to conspiracy theories in the rst place. It is possible (if not likely) that conspiracy theories are less satisfyingthan they are appealing (see van Prooijen, 2019 ). Consider anxiety as an example. As already noted, anxiety may spur people to turnto conspiracy theories, as conspiracy theories may, at rst blush, provide certainty that people crave. Yet, conspiracy theories areinherently uncertain (after all, they are unproven), and they are, inmany ways, anxiety-provoking. If a small group of nefariousindividuals has the power to bring down buildings, governments,and societies, then how can people rest until everyone sees the light? Over time, conspiracy theories may increase the discomfort people were originally trying to mitigate (e.g., Liekefett et al., 2023 ) and even contribute to behaviors that increase a sense of discomfort (e.g., reluctance to engage in preventative medicine; seeBierwiaczonek et al., 2022 ), potentially yielding a vicious cycle of anxiety and conspiratorial ideation. It will also be important to ascertain when and how motives give rise to abnormality. Certain motives may shape interactions with one's environment to form maladaptive traits and consequently beliefs, including conspiracy belief (e.g., Grapsas et al., 2020 ; Zeigler-Hill & Hobbs, 2017 ). For instance, a recent frameworkThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.Figure 7 Strongest Correlates of Conspiratorial Ideation Across Motivational and Personological Domains Note. Individual constructs were selected based on correlations of | r|>.25.CONSPIRATORIAL IDEATION META-ANALYSIS 27maintains that status motivations, or derogate rivals, underly narcissism ( Grapsas et al., 2020 ). These status motivations contribute to people selecting status-relevant situations early in life, such as those with hierarchical socialenvironments, which affords opportunities to behave in waysthat promote the self or put down others. Per this framework, statusmotivations can become pathological in the right environmentsand with strong reinforcement contingences over time. Such amodel can and should be applied to conspiratorial ideation, andby examining motivations and personality side-by-side, it will bepossible to gain insight on potential models. For example, whendo universal needs, such as epistemic needs to understand one 's environment, take a pathological course and contribute to people seeking out environments rife with misinformation? Or howdoes cynicism transition from a normal-range self-protectionmotive to hostility or antagonism (perhaps vis- \u00e0-vis a series of transactions with social environments, e.g., Bouchard & Johnson, 2021 ;Grapsas et al., 2020 )? Theoretical frameworks of conspirato- rial ideation can be strengthened in these ways by incorporating motivational and personological variables. In combining motivation with personality, it will also be critical to consider different levels of analysis. As demonstrated in our quantitative review, more information is gained by looking atvariable-level than domain-level correlations. By examining thevariable-level ndings, it was possible to derive a new set of conclusions to stimulate future research (see Figure 7 ). These different levels of analyses provide different pieces of theconspiratorial ideation puzzle \u2014from the item level to the metatrait level, different levels of analysis offer different perspectivesthat, in turn, provide a complete picture when combined. Similarly,research across different levels of explanation is needed, asintegrating ndings from across these different levels of explanation will provide the strongest evidence as to how conspiratorialideation arises and how to change it. These efforts to elucidatedifferent levels of explanation for conspiratorial ideation can bemost effectively achieved via collaboration across research teams.If researchers can work together to intentionally slice differentpieces of the pie, then it will be possible to get a comprehensiveunderstanding of the descriptive and explanatory processes givingrise to conspiratorial ideation (see M\u00f5ttus et al., 2020 ). Not only does future research need to identify howconspiratorial ideation arises and whether it satis es psychological needs, but also who conspiracy theorists are in the real world. Most existing research on conspiratorial ideation has focused on college andonline participants. There is clearly evidence for conspiratorialideation in these populations, and conspiratorial ideation may verywell be continuous in the sense that most individuals are likelyto endorse at least one conspiracy theory (e.g., Goertzel, 1994 ; Oliver & Wood, 2014 ). Still, the averages on conspiratorial ideation measures are typically far below the maximum scores in collegeand online participants. As a result, it remains an open question asto whether our meta-analytic results generalize to those who areenmeshed in a conspiratorial worldview \u2014those who protest outside of research centers, attend flat earth conferences, or spend their days posting about \"Big Pharma \"online. Future research should aim to include these kinds of people. Perhaps it is these individuals who are simultaneously the most motivated to uphold their conspiratorial worldview anddistressed by their conspiratorial worldview. Our results indicate thatconspiratorial ideation is closely linked with psychopathology,and hence, distress. Yet, there is scant evidence for taxa in thedomain of personality and psychopathology (e.g., Haslam et al., 2020 ). As such, we cannot conclude that conspiracy theorists are qualitatively different from others. To clarify these ambiguities, person-centered and/or taxometric analyses are needed to investi-gate whether those who strongly believe in conspiracy theoriesare typologically different from those who weakly or evenmoderately believe in conspiracy theories (e.g., Ruscio et al., 2007 ). If these two groups are not typologically distinct, then perhaps the same psychological framework could suf ciently account for conspiratorial ideation. But if these two groups areindeed qualitatively distinct, then it is possible that scholarswould need to identify and establish a separate psychologicalframework for those most committed to a conspiratorial worldview.Because those who are most committed to a conspiratorial worldview are the most likely to act on it in detrimental ways (e.g., the January 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol), it is essentialto identify whether our results hold for these individuals. To effectively intervene on conspiratorial ideation in conspiracy theorists, it will be necessary to identify how and why certainmotives and traits intersect to increase risk for conspiratorialideation. There is a rich literature on interventions for misinforma-tion susceptibility (see Ecker et al., 2022 ). For instance, interventions that enhance accuracy motives and analytical thinkingseem to be effective at reducing susceptibility to misinformation(e.g., Fazio, 2020 ;Pennycook et al., 2020 ). Research also indicates that providing fact-checks after people process news headlinescan be an effective way to correct endorsement of misinformation(e.g., Brashier et al., 2021 ). Nevertheless, these misinformation interventions have largely focused on intrapersonal processes, such as reminding people to attend to accuracy (e.g., Pennycook et al., 2020 ). Thus, reminders to be accurate will likely not steer people away from conspiracy beliefs, as those committed to misinformationmay believe they are attending to logic and accuracy. Research is therefore needed to leverage results from our meta- analysis to design novel interventions for conspiratorial ideationthat go beyond reminders to be accurate or check the facts. Inessence, effective interventions for conspiratorial ideation willlikely need to address a combination of epistemic, existential, andsocial motives. For example, reducing outgroup threat perception,perhaps by drawing from social contact theory and providingopportunities for collaborative and effective ingroup- outgroup contact (e.g., Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006 ), may be a worthwhile intervention for conspiratorial ideation. That said, we are hesitantto put the proverbial cart before the horse and recommendinterventions for conspiratorial ideation before a clearer (andmore uni ed) picture of conspiratorial ideation emerges. Finally, research should specify whether motivational and personological domains interact to give rise to conspiratorialideation (e.g., Hart & Graether, 2018 ). There may also be intriguing interactions within motivational and personological domains. Ina recent existential threat model of conspiratorial ideation, itis theorized that epistemic, existential, and social motivescollectively van Prooijen, 2019 ). Speci cally, when experience an existential threat, they engage in epistemic sense-making processes. Thesesense-making processes give rise to conspiratorial ideation whenthere is a salient outgroup that is perceived as antagonistic andThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

These models are useful for understanding the psychology of conspiratorial ideation because they provide a template formaking testable hypotheses about the speci c ways that conspira- torial ideation arises. Conclusion This meta-analysis identi ed the motivational and personological variables that were strong and consistent correlates of conspiratorialideation and whether there were notable boundaries in these relations.To continue advancing research on conspiratorial ideation, scholarsshould work to bridge the motivational and the personological inhypothesis-driven frameworks, strive to move beyond cross-sectionaldata collection, include those who are most wedded to conspiracynarratives, and identify interventions that target broad susceptibilityto conspiratorial ideation. We hope that this meta-analysis can serveas a foundation for such research so that we can better understand and illuminate the conspiratorial mind.
