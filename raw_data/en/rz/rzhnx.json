Holistic medicine, on the other hand, is an ethos or philosophy of medicine used by physicians who have finished traditional medical training but also believe in addressing the whole person- body, spirit, mind, and emotions- to restore and maintain health. Due to its restorative and self-healing approach, naturopathy is also commonly used in integrative medicine and holistic medicine, which embrace conventional medicine in combination with other medical modalities to attain whole-person health.

Naturopathic medicine frequently utilizes holistic medicine philosophies to treat the whole person- body, emotions, and spirit. it also places great importance on how all systems of the body- including the mind and gut- impact physical and emotional health. What is Holistic Medicine? Holistic medicine is a medical philosophy that believes a person can achieve optimal health by restoring and preserving health not only of the body, but of the mind, spirit, and emotions too. Holistic medicine is practiced by doctors who have undertaken conventional medical training but also have a holistic philosophy that centers on a mind-body-spirit approach to medicine. One of the most popular types of holistic medicine is holistic and integrative medicine, which combines conventional medicine with functional, alternative, and naturopathic medicine to attain holistic health. The Difference Between Naturopathic & Holistic Physicians The main difference between naturopathic and holistic doctors is that a naturopathic physician uses natural treatments to allow the body to self-heal, while holistic physicians utilize traditional medicine combined with other systems of medicine and care to provide holistic health. To become a licensed Doctor of Naturopathy (ND), a naturopathic doctor has to graduate from a four-year, professional-level program at a federally-accredited naturopathic medical school (of which there are currently 7 worldwide). The first two years of medical school for a naturopathic physician are similar to those of conventional medical students, concentrating on biomedical and diagnostic sciences. The following two years cover naturopathic diagnostic and treatment methods and include extensive clinical experience. After earning their degree, a naturopathic physician has to pass the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examinations (NPLEX). Holistic medical physicians are physicians that have finished conventional medical degrees. They are typically a Doctor of Medicine (MD) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO). However, they also have a philosophy of holistic health, meaning they believe the body works as interconnected systems and that optimal whole-person health incorporates the balance of not just the body, but the mind and spirit also.
