[Temple Lodge Publishing](https://www.scribd.com/publisher/665949995/Temple-Lodge-Publishing) Reviews for Demons and Healing 1 rating0 reviews Book preview Demons and Healing - Are Thoresen Preface Just as Newton asked himself why the apple fell to the ground and thus started a completely new world of understanding, we must also ask ourselves about the real cause of the following observations. Within both acupuncture and homeopathy, Hering's law describes how diseases leave the body. For instance, a migraine, which physically may be caused by a pulsating artery upon a local nerve, travels from the head and all along the body, and leaves through the feet. It may be that a disease located deep within the body then slowly travels more and more to the periphery and leaves through the skin. All therapists have seen this. We have also seen how diseases, or the causes of diseases in humans, may be transferred to an animal, indeed to a whole herd of sheep. A disease in the parents may go over to the children and to an animal. I have experienced that a severe disease in a patient may jump over to me, and that I immediately get a strong migraine. In addition, we all have seen how a disease develops in time, and when we treat the disease correctly, this development may be reversed; it goes back in time, so to speak. What is the reality behind these observations? How can they be explained? What, actually, is travelling around? What is it that is jumping from one person to another? These are questions that we must ask ourselves, both to understand and to be able to treat a disease. The answer, in my humble opinion, is that the disease is the result of the presence of a noxious or pathological structure, a structure that may travel, jump, dislocate, develop itself, and also change to a former state of development. This pathological structure behaves like an entity. There are two sorts of such pathological beings (yin and yang). When we treat, whether with homeopathy, acupuncture or herbs, there are two possible outcomes from a seemingly successful treatment: either the pathological structure is dissolved or it is translocated. If we treat the symptoms (which I will call the excess), even if we treat the cause (which I will call the deficiency), the pathological structure is usually just translocated. We think then that the disease is healed, but it is just hidden or moved. For a long time, I have observed this happen for me and for my colleagues (I would say that it happens in 90% of all alternative treatments), and the most important question for me in the last years has been how to truly dissolve the disease. This translocation gives a point of departure for the understanding of the observed connection between all living entities. There is a strong energetic connection between all levels of creation: we are all connected energetically through the existence of the elementals\u2014both the spirits and the demons, in the following ways: Between Cosmos and Earth. Which is why disease changes with changing external situations and thus gives rise to all the diagnostic systems based upon this. Between Earth and all living creatures, which explains the same as the above, together with 'geopathy'. Between all living creatures. Which is the foundation for my way of doing pulse diagnosis, anthroposophical medicine and osteopathy. Between all parts within a living entity. Which is an explanation for why ECIWO-systems* work, in fact a basis for the complete holistic approach in medicine. The old shamans healed in the consciousness of nature: they felt connected to the forces and gods of nature, and they felt this bond between all creatures. As we will see in this book, this total connection to creation leaves us also vulnerable to invasion by elemental beings. The only way to keep safe and sound is to strengthen the spirit, our own self-consciousness. That is why the most important task of future spirituality is to strengthen the 'I' or Ego-function of man. That is, the cosmic and divine Ego-function, not the egoistic 'I'. * Moses was the first person to call God, 'I am'. Jesus told the people that he was a messenger from 'I am': he even called himself 'the I am'. The truth is to be found within you. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard was the first philosopher who, in 1851, proclaimed that the subjective self was the truth and that the general consensus was the untruth. The Norwegian author and philosopher J.S. Welhaven and the Danish philosopher F.C. Welhaven expressed himself as follow: do not study philosophy existentially.' In other words, Hegel did not comprehend it as a living experience (or a life-experience) in the subject: in this respect, truth cannot be digitalized, formalized, stored on a shelf or sold over the counter. Kierkegaard turned against Hegel, who died in 1831, when Kierkegaard was 18 years old. In the middle of the 1900s, existentialism spread in Europe, and the most important proponents were Gabriel Marcel, Karl Jaspers, Martin Heidegger and Jean Paul Sartre. Rudolf Steiner said that, 'only in thinking the will can you find the truth and the forces available for healing'. Margit Engel expresses likewise: 'Healing is only possible if you activate your courage.' And by 'courage' she meant 'will-intention-consciousness'. Modern physics also proclaims that consciousness is necessary to explain the behaviour of quanta, and it is now considered as a part of quantum physics. In modern times, philosophers like Tomas Nagel proclaimed that consciousness is necessary to comprehend reality, and indeed a part of reality which science so far has not integrated in its (mostly) materialistic worldview. Susan Blackmore and Paul Churchland, on the other side, declare consciousness as a grand illusion. They think (!) that consciousness does not truly exist, other than as an 'illusion of being conscious'. The consciousness that I will here try to explain or describe in this book is of great importance when diagnosing and treating, otherwise we may even harm our patients. This consciousness reveals the hidden relationships between all living beings, both human and animal, and how therapists may cause harm to those connected with patients without realizing it. * Throughout my life, my professional life in particular, I have been able to observe diseases both through pulse diagnosis and by seeing the distorted and pathological energetic structures directly with the help of an elevated sensitivity. I have then observed that when the disease has been treated, whether through acupuncture, chiropractic, osteopathy, homeopathy or herbal medicine, the pathological structure has merely been relocated to another place in the body, or into another entity, animal or human. Sometimes the patho-structure just takes a little round trip, and then returns to its original place. We then say that the disease has reappeared. I want to shed a conscious light on the fact that, when treated, diseases caused by energetic and self-containing structures may influence or 'attack' other beings, change, or just come back. This description of diseases sounds a lot like descriptions of real and living entities. There are many stories and insights from olden times and old religions, where disease and ailments were regarded as separate and individualized entities, or energetically self-conscious structures, described as elementals, spirits, demons or devas. Many of us have experienced that if we are too open in the moment of acupuncture treatment, the energetic pathological structure may jump over, attack us and inflict us with the disease itself. We have also seen that such pathological structures may inflict, influence or create disease in creatures connected to the patient. We are all interwoven in an enormous web of energy, a web that connects all living entities in the world, maybe the whole cosmos. This web is to be seen just on the other side of the threshold of the spiritual world. It is called by many names, such as the akashic record, karma or the matrix. This web is made of energy, but not just lifeless and aimless energy. It is made up of elementals: living etheric beings, created by our minds, our thoughts and our actions. This web is also part of our diseases and is influenced when we treat energetically. In olden times, and still we may see this phenomenon today, the doors to temples of small communities were bordered by the pictures or sculptures of ugly-looking demons. This was to scare the real demons or negative spirits away, to scare diseases away. There is a moving story about Jesus, told by Rudolf Steiner in his lecture cycle The Fifth Gospel: When in his 20s, he visited one of the Essene communities. He realized that the sculptures around the door scared or drove the evil spirits away, but then a very important question arose in his mind; to where were the spirits driven? Then he understood that it was no solution just to drive the bad spirits away to other people, to save somebody at the cost of creating disease in others. This question and realization opened his mind to be the receiver of the Christ, the redeemer of all. Rudolf Steiner described the same phenomenon in his lectures entitled Introducing Anthroposophical Medicine: The concept of infection, however, is none the less valid here. For any highly tuberculous individual affects his fellow beings and if any person is exposed to the sphere in which the tuberculous patient lives, then it may happen that the effect turns again into a cause. I have often tried to illustrate the relationship between primary causes of a disease and infection in the following analogy: Suppose that I meet a friend of mine, whose relations with other people do not in general touch me. He is sad and has reason to be so, for he has lost one of his friends by death. I have no direct relationship with this friend who has died, but I become sad with him at his sad news. His sadness is, so to speak, first hand and direct; mine arises indirectly, communicated through him. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the mutual relationship between my friend and me provides the pre-condition for this 'infection'.* He continues in another lecture: The method referred to would consist in making every possible effort to make the Ritter therapy universally accepted. In face of successes of this treatment, you forget that you work as individual physicians. Possibly individuals among you may be aware of the struggle you have to wage against the majority of other doctors, and you may be aware that the moment you make Ritter's treatment into an accepted university institution, you would cease to be a minority in opposition, and that treatment would then be practised by many others\u2014I will not go so far as to say by all. You would then find the number of your successful cures appreciably diminished. So strangely do things befall in real life; they are often quite different from what we have imagined. As individual medical men you have the greatest interest in healing the individual patient, and modern materialistic medicine has even, one might say, sought in this way a legal justification for its aim of healing the individual, but this justification really consists in the claim that there are no diseases; there are only sick, diseased people! Now, this justification would be valid ifpatients were really so isolated regarding their sickness, as appears to be the case today. But in actual fact, individual patients are not so isolated. The fact that certain dispositions of disease spread over a wide region, as was mentioned yesterday by Dr E., is of great importance. After curing one case, you can never be sure of the number of other individuals to whom you have brought the disease. A single case of a disease is not viewed as part of a general process, and therefore, taken one by one, the individual result may be most "}
