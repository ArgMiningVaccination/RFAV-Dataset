Otherwise, \"the entire decision\" may be made available to the public per the E-Government Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-347, 116 Stat. 2899, 2913 (Dec. 17, 2002). At trial, Petitioners were represented by Sylvia Chin-Caplan, with attorneys Thao Ho and Amy Fashano2 assisting. For Respondent, Linda Renzi, Althea Davis, and Ryan Pyles each represented Respondent on one of the three subject areas discussed. The statutory provisions governing the Vaccine Act are found in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7300aa-10 et seq. (West 19913 & Supp. 1997). Hereinafter, reference will be to the relevant subsection of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7300aa.Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 1 of 177Thimerosal contained within two Hepa titis B vaccinations administered to their son Thomas on 17 December 1998 and 20 January 1999, he died sudde nly on 25 J anuar y 1999. After having been filed, this case was grouped together with 24 other cases, all ultimately alleg ing that thimerosal in pediatric vaccines caused, contribut ed to, or triggered the death of the vaccinees. See Unpublished Scheduling Order, filed 28 July 2006. This case was selected as the \"test case,\" to consider the theore tical mecha nism of injury , by which the injury alleg ed (death) could be cause d, as a general causa tion hearing in the context of trying one particula r case. See Unpublished Scheduling Orde r, filed 12 Ma y 2005. Eventually , seven days of hearings on the ultimate issue of vaccine causa tion were convene d by the Court, the first six held in vivo in Washington, the federal District of Columbi a on 9, 10, and 11 June 2008, to hear Petitioners' case in chief , and on 24, 25, and 26 June 2008, to hear Respondent's witnesses (Petitioners also offered, on 26 June, rebuttal testimony ). Hearing Transc ripts 1-6. Due to the new evidenc e introduced during Petitioners' rebuttal testimony , a further hearing was held in Tampa, Florida on 15 Januar y 2009. Transc ript 7. Wherein, t he Court heard from medical expert witnesses for both parties: toxicolog ists, cardiologist s, and patholog ists. Following those hearings, the parties filed closing briefs with the Court, and this matter is now ripe for a ruling . As a preliminary matter, the Court notes that Petitioners in this case have satisfied the pleading requisites found in \u00a7 300aa- 11(b) and (c) of the statute, by showing that: (1) they are the real party at interest as legal representa tives of their son Thomas, the injured party ; (2) the vaccine at issue is set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3); (3) the vaccine was administered in the United States or one of its territories; (4) no one has previously collecte d an award or settlement of a civil action for damag es arising from the alleg ed vaccine-re lated injury ; and, (5) no previous civil action has been filed in this matter. Additionally , the \u00a7 16 require ment that the Petition be tim ely filed has be en met. On these matters, Respondent tende rs no dispute. The Va ccine Act burde ns the Offic e of Special Masters with the duty to make ruling s and4 decisions on petitions for compensa tion f rom the Vaccine Prog ram, to include finding s of fact and conclusions of law. \u00a712(d)( 3)(A) (I). In order to preva il on a petiti on for comp ensation under the Vaccine Act, a petitio ner must show by preponde rant evidenc e that a vaccination listed on the Vaccine Injury Table either caused an injury specifie d on that Table within the period desig nated there in, or else that suc h a vac cine actually cause d an injury not so specified. \u00a7 11( c)(1)(c). I. FACTUAL RECORD Despite their accord on certain factual predic ates contained in the filed medical records, there is, unsurprising ly, a pronounce d conflict betwee n the parties on certain factual issues of viewing \"Duty, then, is the sublimest word in our language. Do your duty in all things... You cannot do more, you4 should never wish to do less.\" From a letter attributed to General Robert Edward Lee, to his son, G. W. Custis Lee, dated 5 April 1852. -2-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 11/23/10 Page 2 of 177understo od scientific mecha nisms within the context of the expert witness testimony and the medical records. Considering these disput es and the C ourt's commi ssion to resolve them, it behooves the Court to ex plain the leg al standar d by which fa ctual finding s are made. It is axiom atic to say that a petitioner bears the burden of proving , by a preponde rance of the evidenc e-which this Court has likened to fifty percent and a feather-that a particula r fact occur red or circumstance obtains. Put another way, it is require d that a specia l master, \"believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexis tence befor e [he] may find in favor of the party who has the burden to persua de the [special master] of the ring). Moreove r, mere conjec ture or speculation does not meet the preponde rance standard. Snowbank Enterprises v. United States , 6 Cl. Ct. 476, 486 (1984). This Court may not rule in favor of a petitioner based on his asseve rations alone. This Court is authorized by statute to rende r finding s of fact and conclusions of law, and to grant compensa tion upon petitions that are substantiated by medical records and/or by medi cal opinion. \u00a7\u00a7 12(d)( 3)(A) (i) and 13( a)(1). Contemporane ous medical records are afforde d substantial weig ht, as has been elucidated by this Court and by the Fe deral Circuit: Medica l records, in general, warrant considera tion as trustworthy evidenc e. The records contain information supplied to or by health profe ssionals to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions. With proper treatment hang ing in the balanc e, accuracy has an extra premium. These records are also generally contempora neous to the medica l events. Cucuras v. Sec of HH F. 2d 1525, 1528 ( Fed. Cir.1993). l records useful to the Court's analy sis when considere d in reference to what they include, ra ther than w hat they omit: [I]t must be recognized that the absenc e of a reference to a condition or circumstance is much less signific ant than a reference which negates the existence of the condition or circumstance. Since medical records typically record only a fraction of all that occur s, the fact that reference to an event is omitted from the medical recor ds may not be ver y signific ant. Murphy v. Sec'y of HHS , 23 Cl. 726, 733 2d 1226 (Fed. C ir. 1992), cert. denied sub nom. Murphy v. Sullivan , 113 S. Ct. 263 (1992) (citations omitted), citing Clark v. Sec'y of HHS , No. 90-45V, slip op. at 3 (Cl. Ct. Spec. Mstr. Marc h 28, 1991). Special masters frequently accord more weig ht to contempora neousl y recorded medical symptoms than those recounted in later medical histories, affidavits, or trial testimony . \"It has generally been held that oral testimony which is in conflict with contempora neous documents is entitled to little evidentiar y weig Murphy v. Sec'y of HHS , Cl. Ct. 726, 733 (1991). See also -3-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 3 of 177Cucuras v. Sec 'y of HH S, 993 F.2d 1525, 1528 (Fed. Cir.1993). Memories are generally better the closer in time to the occur rence repor ted and when the motivation for accurate expli cation of symptoms is more immediate. Reusser v. Sec'y of HHS , 28 Fed. Cl. 516, 523 (1993). Howeve r, inconsistencies between testimony and contemporaneous records may be overc ome by \"clear, cogent, and consistent testimony \" explaining the discrepa ncies. Steve ns v. Sec'y of HHS , No. 90-221V, 1990 WL 608693, at *3 (F ed. Cl. Spec. Mstr., Dec . 21, 1990). A. M EDICAL RECORDS ET AL. The medical records in this specific case are rathe r limit ed and straig htforwa rd, and the Court summarizes them here, followed by the affidavit testimony of Mrs. Kolakowski, a Petitioner in this case: Thomas Kolakowski wa s born 17 Dec ember 1998. His New Born Infant Record notes his general appea rance as \"vigorous and alert,\" his lungs as bilatera lly clear, his heart as normal, and his reflexes (including the Moro (startle), grasping, sucking, swallowing , crying, and tonic neck reflexes) as normal, both at birth and at discharg e. Pet. Ex. 3 at 2. His only clinical complaint was \"mild jaundice.\" Id. Before leaving the hospital nursery , Thomas was note d to have a \"loud and lusty \"5 cry. Pet. Ex. 3 at 11. In the cardiorespira tory criter ia, Thomas was noted to have \"norma l breathing sounds,\" \"nor mal hear t sounds,\" \"norma l rhythm,\" and not to have \"irregular rhythm.\" Id. Under the reflexes category, Thomas was observe d to have intact sucking , grasping , and Moro (startle) reflexes, and to be fre e of tre mors. Id.6 The day after he was born, befor e he went home from the hospital, Thomas received his first (of two) Hepa titis B vaccines on 18 December 1998. Pet. Ex. 3 at 13. Also on 18 December 1998, Thomas' \"RN Assessment\" display ed that Thomas responde d to stimul i, had normal tone, showed reflex response s for rooting, sucking , grasping , and Moro (startle) reflexes, had no tremors, had normal bre ath sounds, and a r egular a pical pulse, and ha d a loud and lusty cry. Pet. Ex . 3 at 20. 7 Thomas Kolakowski's pediatric ian records indicate, in a 26 December 1998 record, that communication regarding his circumcision wound was recorded, as was the physician recommendation. Pet. Ex. 4 at 2. In the pediatric ian records' notations f or 24 December 1998, 26 December 1998, 2 Januar y 1999, and 20 Januar y 1999, there was no refe rence to tremors. Id. At a 20 Januar y 1999 visit to the pediatric ian, Thomas received his second of two Hepa titis B vaccinations. Id, Pet. Ex. 4 at 4. The nex t pediatric ian records note that on 25 Januar y 1999, the pediatric ian received a call from the hospital emer gency room that Thomas had arrived there Jaundice is \"a syndrome characterized by hyperbilirubinemia and deposition of bile pigment in the skin,5 mucous membranes, and sclera, with resulting yellow appearance of the patient.\" DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY (30th ed. 2003) (SAUNDERS) at 963. A tremor is \"an involuntary trembling or quivering.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 1940.6 at 115.7 -4-Case Page 4 of 177\"esse ntially dead via ambulance ,\" and that on 1 Februar y 1999, a notation of SIDS was made. Pet.8 Ex. 4 at 2-3. Emerg ency responde r records note that on the morning of 25 Januar y 1999, they responde d to a call at the Kolakowski home to find Thomas in cardiac arrest, his parents frantic, and his fathe r, Mr. Kolakowski, attempting cardio-pulmonary resusc itation (CPR). Pet. Ex. 5 at 2. They were told that Thomas was found by his parents in bed pulseless, and apneic , despite having been previously9 healthy , and that his parents had last seen Thomas at 3:30 AM that morning . Id. The emerg ency responde flaccid, and non-r eactive, even though his skin was warm and dry, and there were no obvious signs of trauma. Id. They descr ibed mottli ng and lividit y, and blood exuding from the mouth and nose. Id. After this10 11 assessment, they began treatment of CPR , gave him a dose of epinephr ine, ran electroca rdiog ram12 (EKG) asystolic throug hout their ride to the13 hospital, and he wa s transfe rred to the hospital staff still pulseless, apneic, a nd asy stolic. Id. Emerg ency room records corroborate that the above- referenced measure s were in proce ss when Thoma s was broug ht in, and rec orded tha t he was still a systolic, w ith appare nt lividity . Pet. Ex. 6 at 1. He wa s unresponsive and pulseless, his skin was cool, dry, and cyanotic, and showed14 lividit y. Id. The physician's repor depende nt15 lividit y.\" Pet. Ex. 6 at 2. The narrative write-up of his case from the emer gency depar tment recorded a \"norma l birth history aside from being slightly large for dates\" and the jaundice, \"but was otherwise unrema rkable .\" Pet. Ex. 6 at 4. Thomas was said to be \"doing well, feeding well, and showing no signs of signific ant illness or failure to thrive.\" Id. In discussions had with Mrs. Kolakowski, she had \"desc ribe[d] him as having a small head cold or slight head cold, but nothing else was going on,\" the night befor e his death. Id. The same narrative repor ts that, \"On arrival this child was lifeless, pulseless, asystolic in three leads with no spontaneous respira tory efforts and had Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is \"the sudden and unexpected death of an apparently healthy infant,8 typically occurring between the ages of three weeks and five months, and not explained by careful postmortem studies.\" DORLAND'S, at 115. 9 Mottling is condition with patches of color.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 1176.10 Lividity is \"discoloration, of blood.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 1060.11 Epinephrine, in this context, is \"a synthetic preparation of the levorotatory form of epinephrine, used ...12 intravenously as a cardiac and vasopressor.\" DORLAND'S, supra, Cyanosis the skin and mucous membranes due to excessive14 concentration of deoxyhemoglobin in the blood.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 455.

Id. Even after the epinephr ine administered by the EMTs, at the hospital Thomas' EKGs \"continued to show only an agonal QRS complex at best.\" Id. At the same hospital, by the reque st of the16 corone r, Thomas underw ent a postmortem w hole-body raph, which demonstrated \"[a]lm ost complete opa cifica tion of the lung s.\" Pet. Ex. 6 at 9. Thomas death certificate lists \"Immediate Cause (Final disease or condition resulting in death) \" to be \"Sudden unexplained death,\" without any listed underly ing cause s on the appropr iate fields that follow. Pet. Ex. 7 at 1. In the field for \"Other signific ant conditions contributing to death but not resulting in the underly ing cause given in [Immediate and Under lying Causes section],\" there is a notation of \"Ser ies II Hepova c.\" Id. The records from the Forensic Pathology Depa rtment of Dauphin County Coroner' s Offic e, completed in September of 1999, form a n important facet of this case, and the Court quotes from them liberally here. They relate that, \"Rec ently , he had heptava x on Wednesday , 1/20/99,\" but17 that, \"Other than that, he was on no medications.\" Pet. Ex. 8 at 2. They recall the events of his last 24 hours as follows: Per the investiga tors, he had a rash on his face, which was felt to be infant acne, related to Dial Soap. He had been breast feeding twice per day. He was also taking two bottles of formula per day. On the day prior to his demise, he had not been eating well. Appar ently , he had a lot of gas and an upper respira tory tract infec tion. The mother was able to nurse him in the early morning hours. When she awoke , she identified him essentially unresponsive.... The medical records were revie wed from childbirth. In addition, his neog ene screening labora tory repor t accompanied the body . It showed no evidenc e of genetic abnorma lity... Pet. Ex . 8 at 2. On gross examination, Thomas was descr ibed as \"moder ately -built, moderately-nourished.\" Pet. Ex. 8 at 3. When weig hed, his organs were the following weig hts: brain, 540g ; heart, 30g; right lung, 100g ; left lung, 80g. Pet. Ex. 8 at 3-4. His stomach contents were 2cc of brown/g reen particula te matter and fluid, and there was 30cc of bloody fluid in eac h chest cavity . Pet. Ex. 8 at 4. Among the finding s from the examination of the head and centr al nervous system, there was \"[m] ild to moderate edema [] noted.\" Pet.

Id. The opinion given by the medical examiner was that, \"After autopsy and revie w of the history , it is my opinion that the cause of death was Sudden Deat h in Infancy . The manner of death was Natural .\" Pet. Ex. 8 at 7 (emphasis in orig inal). He elabor ated: This case has by Neur opatholog ists, a pediatric patholog ist and three forensic patholog ists (1 pending patholog ist at this dictation). There are no finding s that indicate an obvious ana tomic cause of death. At prese nt we can not [sic] draw a conclusion as to whether or not Heptava x is causa lly connec ted to this child's death. We do fe el, howeve r, that this issue should be examined further. Pet. Ex . 8 at 7. Finally , the Court turns to the two affidavits of Thomas' mother, Mrs. Kolakowski. The first was executed on 3 Januar y 2000. Pet. Ex. 1 at 4. Inter alia, she recollects that she and Mr. Kolakowski had querie d the pediatric ian, at a visit on 21 December 1998, regarding \"some movements Tommy was making that we were unsure of,\" which she descr ibed as \"tremors,\" and which day [she] broug ht [Thomas] from the hospital.\" Pet. Ex. The hippocampus is \"a curved elevation of gray matter extending the entire length of the floor of the temporal19 horn of the lateral ventricle.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 853. The pineal gland is \"a small flattened cone-shaped body in the epithalamus, lying above the superior colliculi20 and below the splenium of the corpus callosum.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 774. A petechial hemorrhage is a \"hemorrhage from capillary leakage at minute points beneath the skin, mucous21 membrane, or serosal surface.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 834.

She recalled that the pediatric ian \"assur ed [her] that they were from the normal development of the ne rvous sy stem.\" Id. She continued: Little by little, I noticed other chang es in Tommy that I was uneasy about. He seeme d to lack the normal startle reflex to loud noises and continued having the body tremors. He also had very loose bowel movements that the doctors attributed to the fact that he was br east fe d.... My mother-in-la w noticed these tremors too a nd asked me if I had mentioned them to the doctor. So, I again questioned the pediatric ian with a phone call made on December 26, 1998, concerning the body tremors. I was again given the same explanation. This phone call was not re corde d in Tommy 's medica l records. Pet. Ex. 1 at 2. At the visit when the second Hepa titis B vaccine was administered, Mrs. Kolakowski says she repor ted that Thomas had diarrhe a, was not feeding well, did not wish \"to sleep or nurse for any length of time and seemed very passive.\" Pet. Ex. 1 at 3. She say s the doctor' s response w as to allay her conce rns because Thomas did not have a fever (\"although,\" she says, \"they did not check for this\"), and that her conce rns were not recorded in the medical records. Id. She recalled that, following that visit, \"Tommy 's diarrhe a seeme d worse but because he was still eating and urinating there was nothing I could do.\" Id. Mrs. Kolakowski desc ribed he r recollection of Thoma s' last 24 hours: By Sunday , Januar y 24, 1999, Tommy was still not a cting right. I knew he was not feeling well and he still had the tremors, which he would have almost daily . We all went to bed that night and Tommy awoke betwee n [3:00 and 3:30 AM] for a feeding. I let him lay [sic] with me after that feeding. When I awoke at approximately [7:00 to 7:15 AM], I discovere d my son in my arm not breathing. There was blood coming from his nose and mouth and blood on the she ets.... Pet. Ex. 1 at 3. She added that later, after Thomas' funer al, she recalls Mr. Kolakowski relating that befor e he c ould attempt CP R with Thoma s the morning of 25 January 1999, \"he ha d to flatten out [Thomas'] tongue beca use it was all balled up.\" Id. In prepa ration for the hea rings, Mrs. Kolakowski was ordere d to compose and f ile another affidavit, descr ibing clearly, by physical descr iption and not medical terminolog y, the phenomenon she had descr ibed as tremors. Wherefor e, Petitioners fil ed Pet. Ex. 35, t he supplementa l affida vit of Cathy Kolakowski, on 22 October 2007. Mrs. Kolakowski admitted there in that, it having been nine years since Thomas had died, it was \"diffic ult to clearly reme mber the few weeks that Tommy was with us.\" Pet. Ex. 35 at 1. She procee ded to be a s specific as she c ould: I noticed Tommy to have intermittent involuntary movements of his extremiti es and torso from the time he was a few days old. These involuntary movements are what I called tremors in my first affidavit. He had episodes wher e his body would stiffen and then the involuntary movements would begin[, at which point,] I would be unable to reposition him to sooth[ e] him. These movements lasted briefly , and would be over in minutes. When his extremiti es would tremble, I would try to hold his hand or comfort him. Despite what I did, the trembling would continue and stop when it -8-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 8 of 177had run its course .... He also had times when he would stare at a fixed area. Despite trying to distract him, he would continue to stare. During these staring episodes, I noticed that he would not blink. Eventually he would stop staring , but nothing I did would interrupt the star ing. Pet. Ex . 35 at 1-2. Based on this testimony , Petitioners retained a well-re ceive d pediatric neurolo gist, with much experience testify ing befor e this Court, Dr. Kinsbourne, to opine regarding a differ ential diagnosis of Thomas' \" tremors\" thus describe d. Dr. Kinsbourne stated in his report: The \"tremors\" could represent jitteriness or seizures. Jitteriness is frequently and exclusively observe d in the newbor n. The movements are generalized, symmetrical, rhythmical and equally alterna ting. They are amplified by sudden stimul i and can readily be abolished by gentle physical restra int of the child. They occur in children who have suffe red a varie ty of generalized brain insults, but also in children who are free from any known impairment. Neona tal seizures can generate \"tremors\" which are \"clonic\", jerking that has alterna ting fast and slow components. They usually have associate d deviation of gaze. Sensory stimul ation and restra int are ineffe ctive in modify ing the movements in a clonic seizure. Staring fixedly can occur as a seizural phenomenon, and cannot be arrested by stimul ating the child. Howeve r, \"nonepileptic seizures\" also occur in the neonata l period. These are seizure-like behavior s which howe ver a re una ccompa some of the proper ties of neonata l seizures, notably their resistanc e to stimul ation and to restra int, and they would have justified electrophy siologica l study . The same applies to the \"staring \" spells. Howeve r, seizures can be difficult to differ entiate from the wealth of other movements that newbor n children of ten make. I n the abse nce of a more prec ise cha racterization of the movements, and of EEG confirma tion, I cannot arrive at an opinion to a25 reasonable medic al proba bility as to their exact natur e. Pet. Ex . 36. B. T ESTIMONY BEARING ON ENTITLEMENT The Court heard oral testimony from seven differ ent experts, some of them more than once, over the course of weeks and month s. The Court here summarizes what it views as the relevant portion of that testimony , but itself review ed all of the testimony provided. An electroencephalogram is \"a recording of the potentials on the skull generated by currents emanating25 spontaneously from nerve cells in the brain.... Fluctuations in potential are seen in the form of waves, which correlate well with different neurologic conditions and so are used as diagnostic criteria.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 596. -9-Case Geor ge W.

Dr. Lucier 's gradua te school work was in insecticide toxicolog y at the University of Mary land's School of Agriculture, coming on the heels of the publication of Rache l Carson's book on DDT, Silent Spring . Tr. 1 at 8. His Ph.D. also specia lized in insecticide toxicolog y, again at the University of Mary land, and included a minor in Chemistry as well. Id. His dissertation was on \"the new breed of organophosphate pesticides.\" T r. 1 at 8-9. Howeve r, he does not possess \"a deg ree that is formally recognized by the Americ an Board of Medica l Toxicolog ists,\" which would require licensure as a medical doctor. Tr. 1 at 136. After completing his Ph.D., he began his thirty -year career at the National Institut es of Health (NIH), beginning as a staff fellow in the Labora tory of Cell Biolog y, and study ing how the body metabolizes and ultimately excretes a varie ty of chemica ls. Tr. 1 at 9-10. Dr. Lucier 's research experience in that capacity taught him that clearance is not direc tly linked to age, that there are some chemica ls that a newborn could metabolize faster than an a dult, and vice- versa .

Due to the areas of his research, he became incre asing ly involved in the study of chemical exposure risk manag ement planning in the federal governme nt, culminating in becoming associate direc tor of the National Toxicolog y Prog ram and a direc tor of the Toxicolog y Prog ram at the National I nstitut e of Envir onmental Hea lth Sciences. Tr . 1 at 12. In the forme r of those capa cities, his responsibility was \" to coordinate toxicolog y research and testing across the federal agencie s for compounds of interest in which toxicolog ical information was neede d.\" Tr. 1 at 16. In this pursuit, Dr. Lucier felt it his responsibility to encour age labora tory in vitro studies, the results of which could be used by federal regulatory authorities to estimate toxicolog y standards. Tr. 1 at 19. He favor ed in vitro studies because \"[m] echanism data provides the biologica l plausibilit y or response that might occur .... epi[demiologic ] studies are notoriously insensitive, and ... animal [studies are] often criticized for high doses.\" Tr. 1 at 20. Dr. Lucier27 continued by explaining his involvement with the study of merc ury's relative toxicity.

He explained that the World Health Organization and the Environmental Protection Agency both accept this27 form of research on toxicology, as did the National Toxicology Program under his helm.

Tr. 1 at 25. Dr. Lucier has authore d approximately 250 article s, but only a couple of those we re on me rcury, and those we re early in his care er. Tr. 1 at 27. 30 Dr. Lucier next discussed the result of his efforts to reach a consensus on safe merc ury levels among the var ious feder al authorities. Unsurpr isingly , the agencie s differ ed on which studies a nd which data were most persua sive, and what the data implied. Tr. 1 at 31-33. There were diverg ent results from a few studies in the Faroe and Seychelles Island populations, which all agreed were proper ly performed, notwithstanding the differ ence in their finding s. Tr. 1 at 33. Dr. Lucier 's role was a s an org anizer, not as a r esearcher or a s an ana lyst of the diffe rent da ta sets. Id. Limitations in logistics, funding , and time require d federal researchers to perform safety level testing on only representa tive samples of larger chemica l groups, testified Dr. Lucier , and it was his purview \"to make an initial decision about what shoul d be tested.\" Tr. 1 at 44-45. W hen it came to the grouping of organomer curia ls, there already existed sufficie nt data indicating that methy l merc ury was a neurotoxin, wher eas little was known about the potential toxicity of ethyl merc ury. Tr. 1 at 45. There fore, to assess ethyl merc ury's toxicity, Dr. Lucier opted to use the data for methy l merc ury, inasmuch as \"they were structura lly simil ar, differ ing only in the methy l group[, b]oth form the same and b]oth were neurotoxicants, seeme d like a very good surrog ate.\" Tr. 1 at 45. He repor ted the consensus to employ this proce ss of extrapolation was wide sprea d, as it was a c ommon practice . Tr. 1 at 46. This extrapolation was based on the presumed similarity betwee n ethyl merc ury, the organomer curia l that forms a component of thimerosal, and methy l merc ury. Dr. Lucier communicated his underst anding of the medical literature extant, stating that the symptoms associate d with methy l merc ury toxicity are identical to those experience d with ethyl merc ury: \"tremors, convulsions, ataxia, all these kinds of things that have been seen with high levels of methy l merc ury exposure.\" Tr. 1 at 37-38. Among the few differ ences he noted were that ethyl merc ury-more so than methy l merc d with electroca rdiog raphic altera tions by the poisoning studies from Minamata Japan, and cardiovascular effects as discussed in the Cinca paper . Tr. 1 at 38. Both methy l and ethyl merc ury are \"organomer curia ls,\" also referred to as \"alky l merc urials.\" Tr. 1 at 40. The signific ance of this fact to Dr. Lucier is that althoug h \"organomer curia ls have considera ble stability in the environment,\" they are slowly metabolized in 2the human body , producing inorg anic merc merc uric chloride, HgCl) as the metabolite (i.e., the end product of that proce ss). Tr. 1 at 41. This is true of both me thyl and ethyl merc ury. Id. The diff erence be tween the two, said Dr. L ucier , is tha t \"in the human body that de- He later added that ethyl mercury had also been found to be a neurotoxin as well, based on data from Iraq,29 Ghana, and Romania; however, he did not reference where in the filed exhibits those data could be found, and Petitioner did not introduce them. Tr. 1 at 35-36. As he put it, \"Most of my work with mercury was involved in chairing the committees that I talked about.... 30 So most of my work with mercury has been involved with a risk assessment of it, not performing bench-related research, although I did have a couple articles [that] were pretty much mechanistic articles looking at how mercury affected different kinds of cytochromes.\" Tr. 1 at 27. -11-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 11 of 177ethylation reaction occur s faster for ethyl merc ury than it does for the corresponding de-me thylation for methy l merc ury ... [i]t's a greater rate of formation of inorg anic merc ury from ethyl merc ury than there is from methy l merc ury, althoug h it's the same metabolite once formed.\" Tr. 1 at 42. Dr. Lucier stated that, inasmuch as thimerosal is composed of nearly 50% ethyl merc ury, the body 's metabolism of thimerosal would result, in part, in that same metabolite, in a chemica l proce ss quite the same as would occur with methy l merc ury. Tr. 1 at 42-43. Indeed, he added, both forms of organomer curia ls are toxic. Tr. 1 at 43. L ater, he ela borate d more spec ifically on this point : [T]he generally accepted mecha nism of action is that they affect sulfhy dryl groups. 31 They affect a lot of enzymatic pathway s, a lot of cellular macr omolecules. They affect glutathione levels that regulate a lot of clearance mecha nisms for other toxic32 chemica ls, so they are broad spectrum toxic and they affect many , many differ ent organs. Tr. 1 at 115. When it came to evalua ting ethyl merc ury's toxicity on the basis of methy l merc ury studies,33 the question arose as to what data sets to use from the extant methy l merc ury toxicity research. One researcher in the field was a Dr. Grandjean, who oversa w research on the Faroe Island population: The big question that quickly arose when the Grandjean studies were published is are they credible? Are they useful for risk assessment purposes? Are they solid enoug h studies to do that? You just don't want to take any study when you do risk assessment. ...[W ]e did something far, far more rigorous than a scientific revie w. We actua lly asked the authors for their raw data so it could be analy zed by independe nt statisticians, independent epidemiologi sts, independent pharmacologists, independent neurobe haviora l toxicolog ists.... I organized that and chair ed that activity to deter mine whether or not the Seychelles studies and the Faroe Island studies were credible studies. The conc lusion was that they were. There were some possible reasons why they were differ ent, but the conclusion of that quite distinguished panel of indepe ndent scientists was they were both g ood studies. Tr. 1 at 48- 49. Dr. Lucier summarized the Faroe Islander a nd Seychelles Islander series of studies, sta ting that they analy zed neurolog ical effects sustained by islanders who ate fish contaminated with methy l merc ury, using analy tical methods employ ed in the Iraqi studies.

Weighing the differential attributes between ethyl and methyl mercury, Dr. Lucier concluded that they are33 \"equally toxic.\" Tr. 1 at 127. -12-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 12 of 177studies did not demonstrate measura ble negative neurological effects. Tr. 1 at 39. The merc ury ingested in the fish rema ined at a relatively low dose level. Id. Dr. Lucier contra sted the Seychelles studies with the Far oe Islands studies conducted by Phill ippe Gra ndjean et al. The subjects of the Faroe studies had consumed whale meat contaminated with methy l merc ury. Id. Neur obehavior al assessments indicated negative effects related to sensation and motor ability , and cognitive defic its were noted i n children whose m others had eaten the m ercury-tainted whale m eat while pregnant. Tr. 1 at 39-40. Dr. L ucier also stated that simil ar types of problems were also seen in an unnamed New Z ealand study , wher e mer cury intake wa s at lower dose s. Tr. 1 at 40. Dr. Lucier discussed the disparity in results betwee n the Faroe Island and Seychelles Islands studies, noting that, even though his te am examined the studies' methods and data sets, they could not resolve or explain the disparity , except to identify some varia nces in the subjects of the studies: [One,] the ages were differ ent. The children were young er when they were evalua ted in the Seychelles study than the Faroe study , and the young er the children are the more varia tion there are in the results because of normal developmenta l differ ences, so that was one possible explanation, the age at which the measure ments were made. Two, there were differ ent neurobe haviora l measure ments made in both studies. The Grandjean studies [in the Faroes] were domain specific , and the Clarkson [studies in] the Seychelles were global measure s of neurobehavioral function, so there were a differ ent set of mea surements made . A third possible difference was that in the Faroe Island it was more of an episodic kind of exposure. You know, you don't eat necessarily whale meat every day, [but an occ asional] big meal of it, and then might not e at it again for another fe w wee ks and so the ex posure was more e pisodic where as in the S eychelles they were eating some fish every day. The whale meat was more contaminated, but the people didn't eat it as often, so a differ ence in the patterns of expos ure I guess that could have accounted for some of the diff erences. ...A job of that workshop was to deter mine whether or not those studies are credible and whether the Faroe Island study could be used in risk assessment. The conclusion was it could be because it was a solid study , but we couldn't explain why it was differ ent re sults from the Sey chelles studies. Tr. 1 at 61-62. To circumvent the negative data set in favor of the positive data set, to show that \"the Seychelles population might be a bit differ ent in how they handle merc urial compounds,\" Dr. Lucier referenced a table from Pet. Ex. 18, Tab HHH, at 320, which list varia bles neurotoxicants\" (including other forms of merc ury) as \"sourc es of uncer tainty .\" Tr. 1 at 64-66. Of course , the same could just as easily be said about the F aroe Island population. The conclusion of the National Academy of Science s, in choosing betwee n the two to settle on a reference dose for risk assessment purposes, was to use \"a positive study that was well conducte d. In other words, you have real data in which you can deter mine benchma rk doses.\" Tr. 1 at 67. This choice is based on the rationale that, \"You certainly wouldn't want to take a negative -13-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 13 of 177study beca use y ou have to a ssume that a we ll done positive study , the ef fects are in f act real.\" Tr. 1 at 67. There fore, the NAS used the Grandjean-F aroe Islands data as the basis for their risk assessment. Dr. Lucier discussed in some detail some of the multifarious factors that account for the varia bility in merc ury toxicity within the population, including age, sex, and genetic predisposition: Age is one.... [D]eveloping systems, whether it be the nervous system or any system, are more sensitiv e to risk because that organ is developing and differ entiating at a critica l stage wher e, if you disrupt it, it will never become right, and this is a well-known tenet of developmenta l and reproductive toxicolog y. So there would be critica l windows for each organ system wher e they would be most sensitive to toxic effects. ...[T]he nervous system development is sprea d out. It starts in utero , certainly , but continues on into development. So proce sses like synaptoge nesis, cell migr ation, myelinization that are going on for years after the baby is born. So for neur otoxicants, exposure as a n infant is a cr itical window. ...Gender is another . There are common gender differ ences in risk that males or34 fema les might be more sensitive to risk than we know. ...[Ex amining the differ ent results of the Faroe and Seychelles studies] indicate[s] all of the fa ctors that ar e involved in diet, ca using diff erences in re sponse. ...Gene tic differences ... you have genetic predisposition to the toxic effects [of] many chemica ls, and this is the reason why drug companies now are getting genetic screening s, genetic tests, to try to deter mine which of their patient s might be adver sely affected by drugs.... Merc ury is no different. There are genetic predispositions. ...Diffe rences in clearance rate. I've seen a number of numbers from [methyl] merc ury. There aren't as many numbers for ethyl merc ury, but the differ ence seems to be -- that one paper I looked at had a differ ence between a 36- and 189-day half-life for methyl merc ury. This is just looking at blood; never mind the other compar tments. So t hat's a f ivefold diffe rence just by itself. ...Existing body burdens of merc ury are already high in some people [i.e., previous exposure level and individualized response there to]. Tr. 1 at 120- 123. A signific ant factor that bears more emphasis than Dr. Lucier place d there upon was what was meant by a \"safe\" level, and what that would mean for a potential \"dang erous\" level. When a sked what standa rd wa s used to deter mine a saf e leve l, Dr. L ucier stated as f ollows: Gender is a linguistic and metaphysical term, not a biological or physical term, a regrettably common34 misunderstanding and error.

The traditional risk assessment approa ch was to identify a LOEL , a lowest observe d effect level, or a NOEL , no observe d effect level, so NOEL /LOEL , no observe d effect level -- this was from animal s tudies -- or a LOEL . Then y ou use safety factors to lower that35 dose. For example, if you only had LOEL data and you didn't have a NOEL endpoint you'd have to put a safety factor in to account for that. That might be 10. You'd have to account then for the fact that humans might be more sensitive than the specie s being tested. You mi ght put another fa ctor of 10. Y ou would then have to account f or interindividual varia tion, va riation among the population.... They have to put that in there too, so you could have quite an accumulation of safety factors. It was that approa ch that EPA had used in their repor t to Congr ess using the Iraqi data. I can't reme mber all the exact numbers, but it was that approa ch that they used and ultimately got down to recommended RFD, so-ca lled virtually safe exposure level, of .01 methy l mercur y per kilog ram pe day . Tr. 1 at 51-52. This a pproac h led the EPA to reach a much lower safe dosag e-0.1 microg rams per kilogr am per day-than did other governme ntal entities, such as the Toxic Substances Disease Registry of the Centers for Disease Control (0.6 microg rams per kilogr am per day), which had relied on the data from the Seychelles study , or the Food and Drug Administration (0.4 microg rams per kilogr am per day), which, Dr. Lucier said, was based on adult data. Tr. 1 at 53. The National Academy of Science s tried to integ rate those safe level assessments from those agencie s to arrive at a risk assessment \"benchmar k dose,\" which is a dose at wh ich some statistical interval, measured from a per centa ge of the population with a physical response to the dose (e.g., a dose at which 5% of the population would evidenc e a response ). Tr. 1 at 54-55. Using the data from cognitive testing performed on the subjects of the aforementioned studies, they performed a series of estimations and calculations to translate to a blood level of 58 microg rams per liter of blood as the benchma rk dose; from that they then applied a safety factor of 10 to further insulate a safe level, so as to account for differ ences betwee n individuals, resulting in a \"safe\" dose of 5.8 microg rams per liter of blood. Tr. 1 at 55-56. Dr. Lucier made a curious and unexplained conver sion of this data. He stated that the National Academy of Science s' safe dose, measure d as a blood level of 5.8 microg rams per liter of blood, corresponds to the EPA's safe intake dose of 0.1 microg rams per kilogr am per day, as an equivalent measure , which would then confirm the accuracy of one another throug h corroboration. Tr. 1 at 56. Howeve r, Dr. Lucier did not e labora te how an intake dose could ever be equivalent to a blood level dose in evalua ting tox icolog y of a compound, especially after he had made so much of the differ ences betwee n individuals in neurologic al sensitivity and disparities in absorption a nd clearance rates into and out of the bloodstream. That is to say, if how the compound is delivere d to Dr. Lucier explained the use of safety factors (customarily a single power of ten) in \"safe dose\" research. 35 In moving from experimental data to guidelines for humans, be it from a mechanistic (e.g., cell) study, or an animal study, the safe level from the experimental data is factored by a power of ten to account for the possibility that humans are more sensitive than the experimental subject. Tr. 1 at 57. Likewise, for each unknown variable that differentiates the public from the known, quantified data, a safety factor is applied (e.g., age/developmental differences, general variability within the population). Id. -15-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 15 of 177the body , the efficiency by which the body moves that compound from its point of delivery into the bloodstream, the relative speed that the compound is metabolized, and the relative speed that the compound is excreted from the blood stream are all varia bles affecting the blood level of a compound, how can an intake dose ever correspond linearly with a blood level amount across a population? If there is an answe r to this question, Dr. L ucier did not ex plain it. Dr. Lucier testified that the reference dose chosen by the EPA was \"mea nt to be a reference dose for women of child bearing ag e.\" Tr. 1 at 58. It is difficult to extrapolate t o a safe level for infants due to a lack of data, because infants do not typically eat foods with methy l merc ury in them, as older children and adults might, and they are not affected by the adult diet so direc tly, as unborn children in utero are. Tr. 1 at 58. Dr. Lucier broug ht attention to a puissant difficulty in study ing or demonstrating a link betwee n org anomer curia ls and a g iven injury : Merc ury poisoning is not manifested immediately after exposure. ... That means when you administer merc ury into an animal or whether it's an accidental exposure the effects aren't seen right away. The effects are delay ed. You see this in all animal studies. They can be delay ed for a considera ble period of time. In the case of developmenta l studies, the exposure in utero may not be manifested until later in life. This is well known for a lot of chemica ls wher e you get in utero exposures. Imprinting effects. There 's other kinds of effects that are not e xpresse d sometimes until adulthood for some che micals. Tr. 1 at 66, 68. A seminal article of medical literature relied upon by Dr. Lucier was Pet. Ex. 18, Tab M, Thomas M. Burbache r et al., Comparison of Blood and Brain Merc ury Levels in Infant Monke ys HEALTH PERSPECTIVES 1015-21 (Aug ust 2005). Dr. L ucier summarized the study, stating that the team of Dr. Burbache r, who has been researching organomer curia l toxicity for over twenty years and is well known in his field, compar ed merc ury levels in the blood and brain 2-28 days after either oral gavage of methy l mercury or intramuscular injection of four vaccines containing thimerosal. Tr.36 1 at 70. Dr. Lucier summarized their findings, among which was that both forms and delivery methods led to me rcury infiltrating both the blood and the brain. Tr. 1 at 71. Another finding was that \"ethy l merc ury appea red to be cleared faster than methy l merc ury from the blood because that's what their clearance data is, predominantly in the blood,\" but that, compar ing ethyl to methyl merc ury, \"[t]here was an appar ent greater rate of conver sion of organic merc ury into inorg anic merc ury.\" Id. The four thimerosal-including vaccines were administered to the subjects weekly, \"so it wasn't exactly like a vac cine sc hedule.\" Tr. 1 at 73. Although the Burbache r study only recorded merc ury levels for 28 days, Dr. Lucier repor ted that \"inorg anic merc ury had an infinite half-life in the brain.\" Tr. 1 at 72. There fore, Dr. Lucier Gavage (from the French for \"cramming\") is \"1. forced feeding, especially through a tube passed into the36 stomach. 2. the therapeutic use of a very full diet; superalimentation.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 760. -16-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Page 16 of 177explained, a linchpin in the Burbache r study is the relationship betwee n organic merc ury intake and persistent inorg anic mer cury levels: The organic mercury does appar ently have a clearance rate from the brain. The inorg anic merc ury does not. So ... right after exposure the organic merc ury is slightly highe r in the brain than inorg anic mercury. If you look 28 days afterwards, the inorg anic merc ury is clearly highe r, and that may be because -- again, this is specula tion by Burbache r and others as well as myself, but this is presumably because the ethy l merc ury in the brain is being dealky lated ther e to form inorga nic merc ury, and once inorg anic merc ury is in the brain it doesn't seem to be able to escape. Tr. 1 at 72. Dr. Lucier wanted the Court to focus on how the initial merc ury measure ments (take n on day two of the regimen) were simil ar as betwe en the subjec ts who orally received methy l mercur y and those who received ethyl mercury by injection (each having a level around 10 ng/ml). Tr. 1 at 73. Howeve r, a glance at those tables reveals that the sever al vaccine doses (administered over four weeks) did not raise this initial level over 16 ng/ml, wher eas the oral intake of methy l merc ury raised the subjects' merc ury levels steadily highe r, to betwee n 30 and 40 ng/ml. Pet. Ex. 18, Tab M at 1018. The fact that the initial reading on day two was equivalent would suggest to the Court a simil ar star ting point betwe en the test g roups, not that the ethy l mercur y delivere d by vacc ine was as potent as the ing ested methy l mercur y in forming inorg anic mer cury in the brain. Dr. Lucier also focuse d on the fact that the Burbache r study 's measure ment of blood levels and recording s on clearance from the bl ood did not track wher e the merc ury went when it left the bloodstream: \"I t may be any wher e in the body . It may be excre ted. I t may be in the body . It may be in the brain. It may be in the heart. All they know is it's not in the blood.\" Tr. 1 at 74. The Court found it rema rkable then that Dr. Lucier 's next statement was that, \"In fact, obviously it stays in the brain because that has an infinite half-life . If you look at the rate of loss of wash out of total merc ury that's disappea ring pretty fast. It doesn't disappea r fast from the brain. It doesn't disappea r at all.\" Id. Although r and would seem that Dr . Lucier was saying that the merc ury in the bloodstream went to the brain, and this immediately after stating tha t it is unknown wher e the blood-bor ne mer cury goes whe n it leaves the bloodstre am. Also, Dr. L ucier stipulates that the ethy l merc ury had a quicker clearance rate t han did t he methy l merc ury, which linge red in the bloodstream longe r. Tr. 1 at 75. Howeve r, he then descr ibes the clearance data charts to conclude , \"the degree of accumulation of inorg anic merc ury in the brain is 10 times greater from the thimerosal treat ment from an equivalent dose or starting point than i t is for the methy l merc ury treatment. Ten ti mes on order of magnitude more inorga nic m ercury in the brain following thimerosal than it would be for the methy l merc ury.\" Tr. 1 at 77. Dr. Lucier 's statements do not jibe with the Burbache r article , howeve r, which summed up the data on this point as follows. The reg ression estimate for methy l merc ury half li fe is \"58.4 + 25.0 days (r = 0.57);\" howeve r, \"[t]he half life of inorg anic Hg is too long (> 120 days) to be accurate ly estimated from the prese nt data (i.e., r is not significantly differ ent from 0).\" Pet. Ex. 18, Tab M at 1018. In compar ison, the regression estimate for ethyl merc ury half life is \"14.2 + 5.2 days (r = 0.76);\" -17-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 17 of 177likewise, simil ar to the other data set, \"[t]he half life of inorg anic Hg is too long (> 120 days) to be accurate ly estimated from the prese nt data (i.e., r is not signific antly differ ent from 0).\" Pet. Ex. 18, Tab M at 1019. Moreove r, if anything, the semiloga rithmic plot of inorg anic merc ury washout falls more signific antly within the ethyl merc ury data group than in the methy l merc ury data group, wher e it stayed more closely constant. Compare Id. at page 1018, Figure 4 with Id. at page 1019, Figure 7. The Court does not understand how Dr. Lucier can seriously argue that there is a ten-fold greater retention rate of inorg anic merc ury with ethyl merc ury as compar ed to methy l merc ury, based on this data.37 All the while, Dr. L ucier 's statements see m to assume that the inorganic mercury levels in the Burb acher test subjects were the result of the organic merc ury treatments, and rose on a scale commensura te with eac h merc ury exposure: Q Okay . And would this data that you've just cited support the fact that the inorg anic merc ury from the administration of thimerosal in the immuniz ed monkey persisted? A Yes. Q Even a fter 30 da ys there w as virtually no chang e? A Yes. So in other words, if you look at this data you have a flat line on the inorg anic mercury , so if you had two injections of thimerosal four weeks apart the second injection in terms of inorg anic merc ury in the brain would be additive to what was already there . So if you have a second injection 28 days later you would double the amount of inorg anic mer cury in the brain. Tha t's pretty much what that da ta is saying. Tr. 1 at 78. Howeve r, without testing a set of control subjects who had not received the merc ury treatments, there is no support for the contention that levels of inorg anic merc ury (which rema ined Dr. Lucier's argument seems to have been based on figures 2, 4, 5, and 7 on pages 1018 and 1019 of the37 Burbacher article, depicting the blood mercury levels and washout rates of methyl and ethyl mercury respectively. On the last day that mercury was administered (day 28 of the study), the blood level for methyl mercury value was 38 ng/ml, and 28 days after that (day 56 of the study), the brain level of inorganic mercury was at an average level of 4 ng/g (based on two data points, one at 8 and the other at 1). However, based on earlier values, the best fit line at that point has a value of 8 or 9, not 4. Correspondingly, on the last day that mercury was administered (day 28 of the study), the blood level for ethyl mercury value was 11 ng/ml, and 28 days after that (day 56 of the study), the brain level of inorganic mercury was at an average level of 11 ng/g (based on 4 data points, two each just above and below that value). Dr. Lucier's argument (which he did not explain well at all) seems to be that the much higher blood level for methyl mercury corresponds to a lower brain level of inorganic mercury, whereas a comparatively lower blood level of ethyl mercury corresponds to a comparatively higher brain level of inorganic mercury. See Tr. 1 at 76-77. What this argument ignores is that inorganic mercury in the brain was statistically pretty constant in both the methyl and the ethyl mercury groups, and did not seem responsive to the intake of organic mercury to a statistically relevant degree. The argument strains to the breaking point because it attempts to relate two different values that are not necessarily related, assuming a relationship which the argument sets out to prove, rendering the argument circular. Also, as other studies have pointed out, whatever metabolizing of the organic mercury would have occurred would have taken more than 28 days to do so, further attenuating any relationship between the organic mercury blood levels and the inorganic mercury brain levels. -18-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 18 of 177at a fairly static level in the subjects that did receive the merc ury treatments) incre ased signific antly due to the merc ury treatments. It is just as likely that the inorg anic merc ury levels preexisted, independe nt of the merc ury treatments. But this assumption of Dr. Lucier seems to be central to Petitioners' theory of causa tion, and the lack of underly ing, supporting proof does not bode well for the hig her e difice. Dr. L ucier discussed the ne gative effec ts of inorganic mercury , basing his comments upon in vitro nerve cell studies that were performed on snail neurons. Tr. 1 at 79. Turning to in vivo experiments to discuss the dang er of inorg anic merc ury, Dr. Lucier quoted the Burbache r study just discussed to say, \"Conclusions regarding the safety of thimerosal draw n from blood clearance data may not be valid,\" and \"the Pichichero study is not valid for assessing safety of thimerosal.\" Tr. 1 at 80. On the same point, Dr. Lucier noted the data of a paper by Charleston et al., \"an animal toxicity study that he was doing with monkey s,\" which \"suggests that the inorg anic merc ury prese nt in the brain is ac cumulating after a long- term subclinical methy l mercury exposure may be a toxi c form of merc ury responsible for chang es within the astrocy te and microg lial population.\" Tr. 138 39 at 80-81. Dr. Lucier then quoted at length from the National Academy of Science s repor t on methy l merc ury vis-\u00e0-v is inorg anic mer cury: \"Methy l merc ury is very slowly but ultimately metabolized in situ in the brain to inorg anic merc ury. Elemental merc ury is also oxidized to inorg anic merc ury in the brain. It is unclea r whether methy l merc ury toxicity at the cellular level is cause d by the parent compound itself due to its inorg anic merc ury, that is the metabolite, or cause d indirectly by free radic als generated by the metabolism of methy l merc ury to inorg anic mer cury.\" So they raise three possibili ties as plausible possibilit ies. One, the methy l mercury itself; two, the inorg anic merc ury itself; and, thirdly , the proce ss by which inorg anic merc ury is formed, which would release reactive oxygen which is known to be a cellular toxicant, so just a conver sion of methy l merc ury to inorg anic merc ury would produce reactive oxygen specie s which could be toxic. If the ultimate toxic form of methy l merc ury is indeed its inorg anic merc ury metabolite, that suggests the dose of inorg anic mer cury to the brain fr om elemental mer cury exposure -- a nd they didn't talk about thimerosal here; this was methy l merc ury they were talking about -- might be cumulative. I 'm going to g o back a nd start. I missed a line. \"Tha t suggests that the dose of inorganic merc ury to the brain from elementa l merc ury exposure, particula rly from dental amalg ams, and methy l merc ury might be cumulative. That is the case even if oxidation of elementa l merc ury in the blood befor e absorption to the brain is considere d.

Tr. 1 at 82- 83. Dr. Lucier summarized the finding s of the Wins hip article (Pet. Ex. 18, Tab JJJJ, K. A. Wins hip, Organic merc ury compounds and their toxicity , 3 ADV. DRUG REACT. AC. POLS. REV. 141- 180 (Oxford 1986)) a s follows: On page 151 they're talking about sever e reactions, including death, would be acute studies. They conclude here that the LD-50, which is the measure of acute toxicity,40 of the differ ent types of merc ury compounds and given in acute massive doses are simil ar because merc ury in any chemica l form will denatur e proteins, inactivate enzymes and cause sever e disruption of any tissue which it comes into contac t with in sufficient conce ntrations. The signs of acute toxicity usually consist of shock, cardiovascular collapse, a cute r enal f ailure a nd sever e gastrointestinal damag e. Tr. 1 at 85, c iting Winship at 151. The next article of medical literature Dr. Lucier discussed was Pet. Ex. 18, Tab KKK,41 Rudolph Pfab et al., Clini cal Course of Severe Poisoning with Thiomersal [sic], 34 (4) Clini cal Toxicolog y 453-60 (1996). The data from that paper show a logarithmic half life for merc ury in the blood, the first half life occur ring at 2.2 days, and the second at 40.5 days. Tr. 1 at 87-88. Neve rtheless, he also said in that discussion: He added that \"LD-50\" refers to a dose that would be lethal for 50% of those who received it. Tr. 1 at 86.40 He summarized the course of the study thusly:41 This is a case where a 44-year-old man tried to kill himself apparently with thimerosal. Probably not a good choice. He was rushed to the hospital presumably by his family, and they started taking mercury measurements in his blood shortly -- I think four to five hours -- after he was admitted to the hospital, so I presume not too long after. If you look on Figure 1, you can see the time course of mercury disappearance from the blood. Here they're measuring total mercury. The clinical folks who did this actually did a fairly decent study in following the time course. As you can see, they have multiple, multiple points, really more than the Burbacher study, more than any other study I've looked at, even though it was a single individual. There were more measurements made on that individual. Tr. 1 at 87. The subject of the case study ingested a concoction containing 5g (5 million micrograms) of thimerosal, was in health so poor as to \"require[] mechanical ventilation from day 16 to day 18,\" but evidenced zero deficiencies in neuropsychological testing on day 46 following ingestion, and \"neuropathy had resolved completely except for sensory defects in two toes\" by day 148. Pet. Ex. 18, Tab KKK at 454. -20-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 20 of 177They 're making a statement of half-life in the blood. After 2.2 days, half the merc ury is gone from the blood.... So if you look 4.4 days after, three -quar ters. The amount of merc ury in the blood would be down to one- quarte r of wha t it was at pea k. Tr. 1 at 88. On this point, Dr. Lucier is in patent error. At the point of the first half life, half of the original merc ury has dissipated. At the end of the second half life, half of that amount, or one quarte r of the original amount, has dissipated. That means that three quarte rs of the original amount has dissipated at the se cond half life. Since it is a log arithmic sca le, not a linear scale , one ca nnot just double t he time of the first half li fe to arrive at the second half l ife. There fore, three quarte rs of the original amount had dis sipated at 40.5 days, not at 4.4 days. As a matter of science, this is extremely basic, and it does not reflect well on Dr. Lucier 's general persua siveness to ma ke such a blatant mistake on so simple a matter. Surely this was a unintentional error on Dr. Lucier 's part, but it does cut into his persua siveness neve rtheless, e ven to make suc h an er ror. Dr. Lucier compar ed the Pfab data with the Burbache r clearance data as simil ar, in the sense that the ethyl mercury follows a logarithmic clearance schedule . Tr. 1 at 88-89. Unlike the Burbache r research, wher e the brain tissue of sacrificed animal subjects could be observe d, the Pfab research, relating to a human patient, did not examine brain tissue; howeve r, cerebrospinal fluid was remove d for observation of merc ury conce ntration. Tr. 1 at 89; Pet. Ex. 18, Tab KKK at 456. The merc ury level rose from 15 microg rams per liter of CSF on day 10 to 25 microg rams per liter on day 15, befor e falling back to 15 on day 23 and 8 on day 30, such t hat the last measure ment on day 45 indicated a merc ury CSF level of 5 microg rams per liter. Pet. Ex. 18, Tab KKK. Dr. Lucier compar ed this data to the merc ury measure d in the blood thusly : Well, if you compar e the blood to the cerebr ospinal fluid , if you look at the blood, they measure d that over let's take 10 to 45 days. It looks like it's about 800 in the blood going down to probably 50, all right, so there 's quite a loss in the blood during that period of time. Wherea s in the cerebral spinal fluid it starts out at 15, peaks up to 25 and then starts coming down some, but it only goes down in total three fold during that 40-day period so it's obviously much more persis tent in the cerebral spinal fluid, ag ain consistent with what y ou might expect. Whether that's inorg anic merc ury, methy l merc ury or ethyl mercury who knows because they didn't measure that, but what it does say is that it's a biphasic curve with a half-life , and this is important I believe, of 2.2 days in the blood and then a second half-life of 40.5 days which reflects its clearance probably from other tissues, including the brain. Tha t's rela tively consistent to what B urbac her ha d seen if y ou look at the shape of those cur ves. Tr. 1 at 89- 90. Dr. Lucier compar ed the Pfab and Burbache r article s with an earlier article from the 1960s, which also demonstra ted a logarithmic curve for the merc ury washout rate, which he found \"conf irmatory of one another .\" Tr. 1 at 90-91. From this he moved to say (without citation) that the data \"show an initial rapid loss in the blood and a second phase which likely , even though I can't say -21-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 21 of 177for sure, but likely relates to removal from the organs, which is muc h slower,\" such that \"ther e's a more prolong ed exposure in the brain despite the earlier clearance in the blood\" applicable to \" all forms of merc ury.\" Tr. 1 at 91. That conclusion may indeed be true, but Dr. Lucier did not explain how a conclusion of \"early clearance from the blood and more persistent exposure in the brain\" followed simply from the da ta of a recurrent washout rate curve . Tr. 1 at 92. Dr. Lucier moved on to discuss the effects that merc ury has on the body beyond the neurolog ical system. These include \"some effects on reproduction and development in terms of the classica l parameters,\" although \"[ r]enal, i mmune, [and] cardiovascular probably receive the most attention.\" Tr. 1 at 94. Dr. Lucier then turned his focus more specific ally to cardiovascular effects, and the medical literature that has explored that area. First in this regard was the Grandjean study ,42 which \"found that merc ury had an effect on blood pressure ; that it was actua lly a more sensitive indicator than the neurolog ical defic its, and I think they occur red a t blood concentr ations betwee n one and 10 microg rams per liter.\" Tr. 1 at 95. Dr. L ucier saw thi s as significant, because to him, \"The .01 microg rams per kilogr am per day, the so-ca lled EPA safe dose, would be equivalent to 5.8 microg rams per liter.\" Id. The next study on the potential cardiovascular effects of merc ury was a Finnish study compar ing risk rates of myocardial infarc tion to merc ury levels in the hair, presumably from eating fish. Tr. 1 at 96. Dr. Lucier stated that the study \"found a doublin g of myocardial infarc tions in the exposure level that was above two parts per milli on [(ppm)] in the hair.\" Id. Dr. Lucier testified that 1.2ppm in the hair is the equivalent of 5.8 microg rams per liter in the blood or 0.1 microg rams in the diet per kilogr am of body weig ht. Tr. 1 at 96. He did not explain how those conver sions were made, or from what source he was gleaning those conver sions. As noted supra , the Court is dubious about equating intake levels with blood levels, given the varia bles involved, and the same c an be sa id, a fortiori , about hair le vels. From there, D r. Lucier moved on to discuss car diovascular effects of merc ury, referencing the Nat ional Academy state43 Pet. Ex. 18, Tab EE, Grandjean et al., Cognitive deficit in 7-year old children with prenatal exposure to42 methylmercury, 19 (6) NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY 417-28 (1997). For some reason, this was referred to by the parties as the \"S\u00f8renson article.\" The Court here reproduces the significant portion of the text to which he referred:43 The cardiovascular effects of Hg exposure in humans ...[include] tachycardia and elevated blood pressure, ... [i]ncreases in blood pressure and heart rate, ... [and m]arked hypertension.... Exposure to organic Hg has also been associated with cardiovascular changes. Three clinical case reports and two epidemiological investigations have reported similar effects.... Abnormalities seen in severely poisoned patients included irregular pulse and electrocardiograms showing ventricular ectopic beats, prolongation of the Q-T interval, depression of the S-T segment and T inversion. Electrocardiograms of four family members who consumed ethylmercury-contaminated pork revealed similar findings, including abnormal heart rhythms with S-T segment depression and T-wave inversion. Deaths of two children in this family were attributed to cardiac arrest, and their autopsies revealed myocarditis. A child who was diagnosed with acrodynia following exposure to vapors from a paint that contained phenylmercuric acetate exhibited a rapid heart beat and hypertension. Two recent epidemiological investigations have found associations between exposure to low levels MeHg and adverse cardiovascular effects. [The S\u00f8renson article] showed an association between -22-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 22 of 177that \" althoug h the databa se is not as extensive for cardiovascular effects as it is for other endpoints, ... the cardiovascular system appea rs to be a target for methy l merc ury toxicity in both humans and animals,\" and \"adve rse health effects can occur at very low merc ury exposures.\" Tr. 1 at 97-98. Dr. Lucier descr ibed the NAS summary of the S\u00f8renson paper as stating \"alter [ed] blood pressure regulation and heart rate varia bility \" occur red at lower merc ury conce ntrations than other symptoms: \"In other words, it was the most sensitive endpoint less than 10 microg rams per liter.\" Tr. 1 at 98. Dr. Lucier read that article summary in tandem with another , which found \"Men who consumed at least 30 g rams of f ish per day or had ha ir merc ury conce ntrations of two par ts per milli on or more had a highe r risk of suffe ring a fatal or nonfata l acute myocardial infarc tion,\" and that \"Mercury exposure was also correlated with incre ased risk of dying from coronary heart disease or cardiovascular heart dis ease.\" Tr. 1 at 99. Together , Dr. L ucier found t he data from both studies supported the conclusion t hat \"the cardiovascular system is the m ost sensitive endpoint.\" Id. Dr. Lucier used this conce pt of cardiovascular sensitivity to merc ury toxicity below the threshol d of other health effects to state that the EPA reference dose for merc ury intake should be even lower than the 0.1\u00ecg Hg/1kg body weig ht/day standard, due to the potential for adverse cardiovascular effects-pe rhaps e ven 50% lowe r, or half the c urrent refe rence dose. Tr . that have studies' data selec tively to arrive at a highe r risk estimation than di d the EP A in arriving at its reference dose . Tr. 1 at 101. Dr . Lucier opined that \"ther e are arguments that the EPA RFD c ould be re duced e ven further ,\" and re ported that a n EPA alumna, Debr a Rice, co-w rote an article indicating \"the EPA reference dose should be 0.0596,44 prenatal exposure to MeHg and cardiovascular function at age 7. The study of 1,000 children from the Faroe Islands found that diastolic and systolic blood pressures increased by 13.9 and 14.6mm Hg, respectively, as cord-blood Hg concentrations rose from 1 to 10\u00ecg/L. In boys, heart-rate variability, a marker of cardiac autonomous control, decreased by 47% as cord-blood Hg concentrations increased from 1 to 10\u00ecg/L. ...Effects of MeHg on the heart and circulatory system have been observed in several animal models. [One report] described cerebrovascular lesions in four nonhuman primates following long-term exposure to near-toxic to toxic doses of MeHg hydroxide (90 to 120\u00ecg/kg per day). Lesions were similar to those observed in humans with hypertension; intimal thickening, smooth-muscle cell proliferation, and adventitial fibrosis were reported. Pet. Ex. 18, Tab HHH, Committee on the Toxicological Effects of Methylmercury, Toxicological Effects of Methylmercury 169-172 (2000). After summarizing the process by which the EPA reached their reference dose, the authors discuss \"other44 issues not addressed in the RFD,\" including the following: Another area that EPA identified for further analysis was the association between methylmercury exposure and adverse cardiovascular effects. In a study of 1,000 seven-year-old Faroese children, diastolic and systolic blood pressures increased by 13.9 and 14.6mm Hg, respectively, as the cord- blood mercury increased from 1 to 10\u00ecg/L. A 47% decrease in heart rate variability (an indication of decreased cardiac autonomic control) was also observed. In a seven-year observation period of 1,833 Finnish men, individuals with hair mercury in the highest tertile (2ppm or higher) had a 2.0 times greater risk of acute myocardial infarction compared with the rest of the study population. The body burden at which cardiovascular effects are observed in adults should be identified, preferably with quantitative procedures such as BMD analysis. Pet. Ex. 18, Tab NNN, Deborah C. Rice et al., Methods and Rationale for Derivation of a Reference Dose for -23-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 23 of 177which she for EPA purposes convenie ntly rounded off to .1, when in fact it would be more appropr iately rounded off to .06 microg rams per kilogr am per day.\" Tr. 1 at 101-02. In Dr. Lucier 's mind, this means that \"with respe ct to the cardiovascular system the [current consensus] risk assessment[s] may not take into account that cardiovascular effects occur at a lower dose of merc ury.... [Conducting ] a risk asse ssment on those studies y ou'd come out with a lower number or a greater risk.\" Tr. 1 at 116. Additionally , the evidenc e discussed supra convince d him that, \"Ethy l mercury is more toxic ... to the cardiovascular system,\" and there is \"a greater rate of inorg anic mer cury formation than methy l mercur y.\" Tr a 117. Next, descr ibed the Pichicher o study , wher ein blood samples from vaccinated45 infants were taken at two and six months of age, the conclusion of which, said Dr. Lucier , was that \"Ove rall, the results of this study show that amounts of merc ury in the blood of infants receiving vaccines formulated with thimerosal are well below conce ntrations potentially associate d with toxic effects.\" Tr. 1 at 103. Dr. Lucier questioned the validity of that conclusion, based on the unit of measure employ ed for quantify ing merc ury levels, inasmuch as the r esearchers measur ed mer cury dosag e by nanomoles per liter of blood instead of microg rams. Tr. 1 at 104. He explained that the dosag e of 29 nanomoles per liter is the equivalent of 5.8 micrograms per liter. Id. Under those circumstances, Dr. Lucier found it unsupporta ble that \"blood results from [the infants tested] were lower than the 5.8 microg rams.\" Id. The re ason for his positi on is that the Pichichero r esearchers \"took blood samples betwee n three and 28 days,\" which to Dr. Lucier means that, \"his measure ments at best ar e starting when alrea dy two half-lives have elapsed, and reme mber half-life is the time it takes for half of it to leave the blood, so it would be very likely that that number is estimated fourf old. It's not big- time math. Two times two is four.\" Tr . 1 at 105. Assuming, a s he did, that two half lives had passed at five days, he then multipl ies the day five level by a factor of four to reach a value of 16 microg rams per liter, which he estimates as the \"likely real value that those children had experienced\" at day one, such that \"it's likely that some of those children had blood levels that had exceede d the safe level.\" Tr. 1 at 106. All in all, Dr. Lucier opined that \"the46 Pichichero data drew a conclusion that ... [was] indefe nsible because of the timeframe in which the bloodwork wa s drawn.\" Tr. 1 at 109. Methylmercury by the U.S. EPA, 23 (1) Risk Analysis 107, 113-114 (2003). Pet. Ex. 18, Tab JJJ, Michael E. Pichichero et al., Mercury concentrations and metabolism in infants45 receiving vaccines containing thimerosal: a descriptive study, 360 THE LANCET 1737-41 (2002). Beyond that, Dr. Lucier estimated that the Pichichero data was low by an additional factor of 1.7, based on46 figures three and six from the Burbacher paper, which compared the mercury concentration of the blood and the brain, as between methyl and ethyl mercury respectively. Tr. 1 at 110-111. He based this on the presumption that the Pichichero research used methyl mercury properties to estimate ethyl mercury values. Id. However, Dr. Lucier did not cite to the appurtenant portion of the Pichichero article. Also, to the extent Dr. Lucier explained his mathematical extrapolations at all, they were unpersuasive because they moved far beyond the data themselves, and assumed relationships unsupported by the graphical data or the Burbacher paper itself. Moreover, he combined this extrapolation with his estimated day 1 level of 16 \u00ecg/L, which the Court found unsustainable and unpersuasive. Thus, the 1.7 factor was ultimately irrelevant, as it was predicated on another faulty calculation. -24-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 24 of (and Petitioners, according ly) appea r desper ately to misunderstand the concept of logarithmic scale half lives. Dr. Lucier himself had stated earlier that the first and second half lives for merc ury in the blood w ere 2.2 and 40.5 days. Tr. 1 at 87-88. As noted supra , one cannot estimate the second half life by doubling the time of the first, because half life is not linear, but rathe r logarithmic in scale . In this case, two times two does not equal four. The Court feels chagrin on Dr. Lucier 's behalf for making such a simple error not once, but twice, and not from an extemporaneous answer to a sidelong query , but in the course of testimony explaining his previously -composed expert opinion. If that is the heart of his contention with the Pichichero study , his argument is ascia n47 indeed. Dr. Lucier also briefly mentioned, without direc ting the Court to an exhibi t, that a study by NHANE S evalua ted merc ury levels in the population and found an average level in children of 0.3 to 0.4 microg rams of merc ury per liter of blood, but as high as 1.1 microg rams in adult women, and indicated that \"eight percent of the women in this country have merc ury levels that exceed the safe level.\" Tr. 1 at 107. On the basis of Dr. Lucier's earlier testimony , the Court notes that 0.3-0.4 microg rams of merc ury per liter of blood meets the safety criter ia of all the other governme ntal agencie s (excluding than the EPA), and the information about adult women is relevant only for adult and per haps in utero human popul ations, neither of which ar e at issue in this proce eding . But Dr . Lucier stands on these results as proof that \"ther e seems to be a subg roup of people who are at greater risk of harm from exposure to merc ury ... a lot of people that are already right at the edge.\" Tr. 1 at 108. Ela borating , Dr. L ucier stated: If you've got eight percent of the women at child bearing age already have levels that are considere d to put their developing offspring at risk, any additional merc ury exposure of those offspring could very well kick them over the edge. You know, it's a very simple conce pt. You're not starting from ground zero when you inject thimerosal. Like I said earlier, every one in this room has a certain body burden of merc ury, so we'r e not starting from zero. We'r e starting from some number . Tr. 1 at 108. This testimony is relevant to the extent that the merc ury added to the preexistent body burden is a substantial factor in any injury cause d by merc ury toxicity. It mig ht ha ve been helpful if Dr. Lucier had been able to opine on the relative additive toxicity of the merc ury added by vaccines containing thimerosal in compar ison to the other merc ury inputs from the environment; howeve r, the Court understands that this would be quite difficult to quantify . In any event, it is Petitioners' burden of proof to demonstrate that the ethyl merc ury contained in thimerosal-be aring vaccines could potentially be, and was actua lly, a substantial factor in causing the injury complained of, up to and including the dea th of Thomas Kolakow ski (inter alios ). Another fashion in which Dr. Lucier believes ethyl merc ury to be a greater threa t than is generally conce ived, is the disparity betw een blood levels and brain levels: blood levels are what researchers use to quantify merc ury input, because of the ease of testing; howeve r, it is the brain that is seen as at the most risk from merc ury toxicity. Tr. 1 at 110. In contra st, brain samples of living humans are hard to come by, and inconvenient to remove. Dr. L ucier augments this proble m with \"G\u00ea\u00e9\u0090\u00f2 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 177an argument that ethyl merc ury is compar atively more persistent in the brain as compar ed to the blood, where it washes out much more rapidly than does methy l mercur y: [Blood and brain merc ury] levels are going down in every case, but they're going down at differing rates. Again, you're looking at total merc ury. The inorg anic merc ury is yet a differ ent story and actua lly is even more pronounce d than what I just talked about. But looki ng at total merc ury, the br ain to blood ratio i s much hi gher for ethyl merc ury than it is for methy l merc ury, and we're not conce rned about blood toxicity. We're conce rned about brain toxicity here, so the blood levels for ethyl mercury, put in the context of the methy l merc ury risk assessment, would undere stimate risk. Tr. 1 at 113- 14. The Court was not persua ded by Dr. Lucier 's argument on this point. It would seem that Dr. Lucier is compar ing the wrong two curve s. True, as shown by the Burbache r data (figures three and six), there is a greater disparity betwee n the brain and blood washout rates with ethyl merc ury than there is with methy l merc ury. Howeve r, this is only because the blood cleara nce rate with ethyl merc ury is so much faster than with methyl mercury. In fact, the brain clearance rate of ethyl merc ury appea rs as fast or faster than the brain clearance rate of methy l merc ury. In one sense, Dr.48 Lucier is compar ing inapposite values in a fractional proportion: instead of compar ing the blood and brain clearance rates of ethyl merc ury as a ratio to the corresponding ratio for methy l merc ury, it would seem more sensible and relevant to compar e blood clearance rates as betwee n ethyl and methy l merc ury, and the brain clearance rates as betwee n ethyl and methy l merc ury, so as to isolate for examination the var iables that ar e most important. As a second, more practical point, the relative rate of blood washout would seem necessarily to affect the brain accumulation and washout rates for organic merc ury. Whereas blood washout graphic ally resembles a simple negative logarithmic function, beginning at the level of input and decaying throug h half lives to approach zero, the brain must receive substances such as merc ury indirectly from the blood. There fore, merc ury level in the bra in follows a s ort of unsy mmetrical49 \"bell\" curve , wher e the brain incre asing ly receives merc ury from the blood up to a peak level befor e decreasing to a level approa ching zero throug h washout. That means the brain's bell-shape d curve is depende nt on the slope of the blood washout curve (assuming a sporadic exposure to the organic merc ury) to deter mine its slope and peak level, because brain merc ury level is depende nt on the input conce ntration of mercury from the blood. Since ethyl merc ury washe s out so much m ore quickly than does methy l merc ury, this actual ly militates for a shallower curve of merc ury input into the brain. Also, the relatively faster brain washout rate of ethyl merc ury (as compar ed to methy l merc ury brain wa shout rate) will flatten that curve out as well. It is difficult to compare these rates absolutely in the Burbacher figures because figure 3 is a logarithmic scale48 graph with y-axis values from 10 to 1,000, whereas figure 6 is a logarithmic scale graph with y-axis values from 1 to 100. Dr. Lucier himself explained this. Tr. 1 at 151.49 -26-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 26 of 177Finally , to conclude his direc t examination, Dr. Lucier discussed thimerosal in vaccines direc tly. He stated that, to the best of his knowledg e, the Hepa titis B vaccines given to infants contain an average of 12.5 microg rams of ethyl merc ury. Tr. 1 at 129. Given that Thomas Kolakowski was \"about 4 kilo[ grams]\" (8.8 lbs.) when he received his Hepatitis B vaccine, Dr. Lucier opined, \"Tha t would be a dose of three microg rams per kilogr am. The EPA RFD is 0.1 microg rams per kilogr am, so that would exceed the EPA RFD by thirty fold ... just based on that one day of administration.\" Id. Moreove r, Dr. Lucier opined, based on figures 2-7 (pages 1018-19) of the Burbache r article , that \"for the inorg anic merc ury[,] there is no degradation rate. It has an infinite half-lif e. So two days after, there 's roughly 11 nanog rams per gram; at 28 days, there 's one nanog ram per gram. So I think it's reasonable to assume that a second dose of merc ury would50 double that inorg anic merc ury conce ntration in the brain because that has stayed constant.\" Tr. 1 at 130. Howeve r, Dr. Lucier 's assumption presumes that the recorded inorg anic mercury in the Burbache r subjects' brains following the last dose of organic (ethy l) merc ury was there in the brain entirely because of the organic merc ury doses administered in the study. Without a control, sacrificed and measur ed bef ore a ny merc ury doses wer e administere d, this is impossibl e to prove, and too spec ulative for the Court to rely there upon. On cross-e xamination, Dr. Lucier stated that he considers himself \"an expert in developmenta l pharma colog y and perina tal pharma cokinetics,\" and even if not an expert in genetics, then \"one who is very knowledg eable in genetics,\" since he oversa w \"a lot of the genetic toxicolog y work that was done at the National Institut es of Health under the auspice s of the National Toxicolog y program.\" Tr. 1 at 133- 34. Dr. L ucier has neve r performed \" bench r esearch\" on ethyl mercury or thimerosal, but has on methy l merc ury. Tr. 1 at 138. He has not authore d original research literature published in a peer-reviewed journal on either ethyl merc ury or thimero sal. Tr. 1 at 138-39. Dr. Lucier agreed that he is neither specia lly trained in, nor otherwise an expert in the field of neurolog y, but that he has \"had to learn quite a bit of neurotoxicology as part of [his] role as NTP associate direc tor because [ he has] had to overse e som e of the resear ch activities and make decisions about what should be tested and how it should be tested.\" Tr. 1 at 177-78. Nonethele ss, he admitted that he is \"not a ne urotox icolog y specia list.\" Tr. 1 at 179. Dr. Lucier clarified his position from his expert opinions in other lawsuits as to whether he thought a utism could be cause d by vacc ines: [M]y conclusion has been that thimerosal and infant vacci ne cause neuro- developmenta l disorders, and some of the symptoms associate d with autism may be among those disorders. I have ne ver sa id that thimerosal cause s autism. ...[T] himerosal, at the dose given, will cause some neuro- developmenta l disorders in some children, for the reasons that I've stated this morning , and some of those effects may well be considere d part of an autistic syndrome, but I have never said that it has cause d autism. The Court could not tell what data Dr. Lucier was referring to in this statement. Those figures do not appear50 to correspond with data in Burbacher's figure 7, or with any of the others therein. -27-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 27 of 177...[T] he level of thimerosal ethyl mercury exposure can cause effects because it's exceeding a safe level. Whether or not it cause s death is another issue. I don't know whether it can cause death or not for any individual, but I do know that the safe level was exceede d, and whene ver you exceed the safe level, you're at risk for any number of diffe rent he alth eff ects. Tr. 1 at 142- 44. Turning to the proce eding s at hand, Dr . Lucier opined that, even though he does not \" have an opinion on this specific case, ... the safe level of merc ury was exceede d,\" and thus he believes that \"death is one of the adver se effects that could be cause d by exceeding the safe exposure level.\" Tr. 1 at 144. Howe ver, he conce ded that his opinion is limit ed to the \"can it \" aspect of this case ( and the others to which this Causation Ruling perta ins), and he did not venture to offer an opinion on the \"did it\" aspec t; in fact, he did not even revie w the medical records specific to Thomas Kolakowski. 51 Tr. 1 at 146. Later, Respondent queried Dr. L ucier as to the relevanc e of his expert repor t-which detailed the neurodevelopmenta l effects of merc ury-to this case and thos e groupe d with it, wher e Petitioners claim that ethyl merc ury contained in vaccines with thimerosal cause d cardiac problems and dea th, to which he re sponded: I'm just here to provide information on the toxicity of merc ury, and that's my contention, in terms of the evidenc e at hand, that it has cause d developmenta l neurotoxicity in some children and went throug h the reasons why because everyone is already exposed to a certain level. Any additional exposure is likely to have some effect in some children, and the most common effect of merc urials is developmenta l disorders. So I think there is a logic al and defensible sequenc e of information there that leads to that statement, that it will cause neurode velopmental disorders in some children. H ow y ou rela te that to this particular c ase is re ally up to y ou. Tr. 1 at 180. Furthermore , Dr. Lucier conce ded that he does not proff er a theore tical framework for \"how ethyl merc ury and thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines results in sudden death;\" his point is mere ly \"that what has been considere d safe exposure levels for ethyl merc ury or orga nic m ercurials have been exceede d by the use of thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines in infants.\" Tr. 1 at 181. He added, \"I can only say that safe levels have been exceede d and exceede d by not just a trivial amount,\" and that he was unable to offer an expert opinion \"whe ther it is thimerosal's effect on the heart tissue or the brain that would c ause sudde n car diac a rrest.\" Tr. 1 a t 183. Respondent challeng ed Dr. Lucier with the conce pt expresse d by the maxi m tha t \"the dose makes the poison.\" Tr. 1 at 148. When Respondent begged the question whether any substance could be harmful or fatal with the right dosag e intake, Dr. Lucier seeme d to disag ree with that proposition on the basis of \"latent effects.\" Id. His answe r did not address whether high dosag e Petitioners did not offer any medical opinion from an expert in toxicology stating specifically that the amount51 of thimerosal received by Thomas Kolakowski in particular was an unsafe or lethal dose that did cause mercury toxicity sufficient to result in injury or death. However, this is part of Petitioners' burden of proving \"but for\" causation, via a \"logical chain of cause and v. Sec'y of HHS, 451 F. 3d 1352, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2006), rehearing and rehearing en banc denied, (Oct. 24, 2006), cert. den., 168 L. Ed. 2d 242, 75 U.S.L.W. 3644 (2007). -28-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 28 of 177could cause harm, but focuse d instead on whether such harm could be identified, isolated, or quantified, as a practical matter. Tr. 1 at 149. He explained tha t nonspe cific or general symptoms are hard to pinpoint to a particula r cause , it is true, and merc ury toxicity takes some time interval to work its harm, undoubtedly ; howeve r, these are resear ch challenges, and have little to do with whether , as a theore tical matter, with high enoug h doses, any substance could be harmful or lethal. Dr. Lucier 's argument appea rs to be that just because no clinically -evide nt symptoms are observe d or measure d, does not mean that harm is not being done, and that harm is being done by small amounts of a toxin up t o and including the moment when sy mptoms are noticea ble: [Y]ou can detec t these early chang es at much lower doses than you can detec t statistically signific ant incre ases in adver se healt h outcome, and that's the whole basis of mecha nism-based toxicolog y, why that's becoming used so much now in the EPA regulations and FDA regulations and biomedical research, so you can detec t early chang es prior to adver se outcomes. When you can do that, there is a reasonable chanc e that some of those individuals will develop a n adver se effect. Tr. 1 at 150. Dr. Lucier found it \"scie ntifically valid to compar e the doses of ethyl merc ury and thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines to the exposures of methy l merc ury that were consum ed by the population of Minamata.\" Tr. 1 at 159. That is, he thought the differ ence in adver se effects betwee n very small doses and very large doses was one of degr ee, not kind, that a little dos e would have a proportionally small effe ct, and that a big dose would have a larger effect. Tr. 1 a t 159-62. When Respondent presse d further on the relationship betwee n dosag e and the nature of corresponding symptoms (as well as their se verity ), Dr. L ucier elabor ated: [Y]ou might have one set of response s that would occur at high doses, yet a differ ent set of respons es that would occur at low doses.... The amount that you receive is important, but I'm saying that you don't have necessarily a straig ht, linear dose response curve for adver se outcomes, espec ially for something like e thyl or methy l merc ury wher e you have differ ent organs that it affects, you have differ ent latencie s, and you're going to have differ ent shapes of the dose response curve , and you're going to ha ve differ ent sensitiviti es.... Maybe the c ardiova scular sy stem is, in fact, the most sensitive organ.... So the dose response in the cardiovascular system is resulting from a differ ent molecular target. It's going to have a differ ent dose response , probably , likely , than you would for neurologic al deficits, and even for neurolog ical deficits, you're going to have some things that happen at high doses, some things happen at low doses. So what you're getting at, I think, is an oversimplification of biologica l reality.... I mean, you may have subtle loss of IQ that we woul dn't detec t in the population. Obviously , if you look at children now, hyperactive disorders are on the rise.... I'm not attributing that to merc ury.... There are a lot of behavior al problems that are here. Whether or not they are related to thimerosal or mer cury is uncerta in. Tr. 1 at 153-55. Respondent then drew Dr. Lucier back to the theory of the case at hand. He conce ded that he w as not awa re of the exist ence of \"a ny article s that these childre n actua lly suffe r from neurode velopmental delay s or cardiac problems as a result of merc ury exposure,\" and that any -29-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 29 of 177article s of that sort would \"have been, like the Grandjean studies, the article s from New Zealand, which have related merc ury exposure to adver se neur al beha vioral outcomes.\" Tr. 1 at 156. Respondent challeng ed Dr. Lucier 's opinion on dosag e using Pet. Ex. 18, Tab F, F. Bakir et al., Methy lmercury Poisoning in Iraq: An interuniversity , 181 SCIENCE 230-241, 238 (July 1973): Q Whil e you have that in front of you, do you recall the threshold dose of methy l merc ury that was measured in Iraq, in this article , befor e effec ts of toxicity were obser ved? A You mean sta tistical effects. Q Clini cal effects. A No, I don't. Q I'll refer you to page 238, second column: \"Neverthe less, the threshold value of 25-to-45 milli grams of merc ury [that] is computed for pares thesia agrees rema rkably well with the threshold figure of 30 milli grams of merc ury computed by Swedish experts,\" and it goes on. Now, 25 milligrams; that's the equivalent of 25,000 microg rams. I s that corr ect? Tr. 1 at 163- 64. Dr. L ucier did not acce pt Respondent's cha racterization: I would not agree that that's necessarily a threshold ... because effects have been observe d at lower doses since, lowe r leve ls of merc ury exposure. So, obviousl y, it was not a threshold; they just did gross measure ments of neurolog ical func tion and didn't look at the kind of neura l behavior al outcomes that were prese nt in the Faroe Islands. So, obviously , it was not a threshold. Later scienc e showed that statement to be wrong . Tr. 1 at 165. Respondent nex t challeng ed Dr. Lucier on his offered opinion regarding cardiac effe cts of merc ury, in reference to Pet. Ex. 18, Tab U, Shawkat S. Dahha n and Hussain Orfaly, Electrocardiographic Changes in Mercury Poisoning, 14 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY 178-183 (Aug ust 1964): Q In the Dahhan article wher e you just state it discusses the cardiac effects of ethyl mercur y, is that corre ct? Is that why you cited that ar ticle? A I cited that as their adver se electroca rdiog rams and things like that as an example of effect, and I think one of the authors, and I've have to go back and look, had said that those were effects that were seen with ethyl merc ury but appar ently not methy l merc ury, was one of the conclusions of the authors, not my conclusion because I haven' t looked at all of the pa pers in that re spect. Q Okay . But the Iraqi ethyl merc ury poisoning case describe d in the Dahha n paper ; do you know what kind of merc ury that was? ... the initials are \"EMPTS,\" ethyl merc Does EMPTS have the same -30-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 30 of 177pharma cokinetics as the ethyl merc ury and methy l merc ury in thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines? A That, I don't know. I don't know if it does or not. Q Has the cardiotox icity that was descr ibed as a feature of the ethyl merc ury at the EMPTS, has that ever been de scribed w ith thim erosa l-containing vacc ines? A I'm not awa re of that. Q Do you know the dose of EMPTS that cause d the effects observe d in the Dahha n paper ? A I'm sure that all of those doses were high doses because the people consume large amounts, and then no one found out about it until many of the people got sick. So I'm sure it wa s a fa irly signific ant dose. Q Those doses we re dramatica lly differ ent, y ou would ag ree. A I have no doubt about that. It's actua lly difficult, from this article and my recollection of it, to sort out the ex act dose . Q And for the patients who had this cardiac toxicity, did any of them die suddenly , to y our knowledg e, have a sudden c ardia c arrest? A I don't know. Q Did the patients show other signs of clinical neurotoxicity , merc ury toxicity? A I didn't revie w that paper ; I just looked at it for the basis of the electroca rdiog raphic chang es that we re seen as a conseque nce of that exposure. Tr. 1 at 167- 69. Respondent asked Dr. Lucier to explain the differ ence in attributes betwee n ethyl and methy l merc ury, to which he r eplied: There were two differ ences that I alluded to. One was the dealky lination was faster for ethyl mercury than methy l merc ury, and this led to the longe r retention in the brain of the inorg anic merc ury that was formed from the ethyl. It's presumed that it was for med there since it doesn't pa ss the blood brain ver y, very well. ...Ag ain, as I said this morning , when we looked at 2,800 high- production-volume chemica ls for EPA, for which there was little or no toxicolog ical information in the publicly available literature , that industry didn't want to test all of those 2,800. The agreement was they would test the ones that they neede d to test but not the ones they didn't. So they would send reque sts for categories of chemica ls, and if I got a reque st for ethyl and methy l merc ury, I would say that's a category; you only have to test one, not the other, and that's basica lly the proce dure that EPA went throug h with that because the simil arities are so much. ... They are both neurotoxicants, they both have a common metabolite, and they have a very simil ar structure. I t was ver y usual, in the high- production-volume chemica ls, to have differ ent aliphatic chain lengths and -31-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 31 of 177call them part of a structura l class, and that's what you have here, a differ ence in aliphatic chain length, and what you would do with that is generally test the one that you would predic t would be most toxic and then apply that to the others, and that was the proc edure they went throug h. ...They are still basica lly structura lly simil ar, and if you don't have data on one of them, you can assume data for the other. You can assume it from the other, and that's a c ommon practice . Tr. 1 at 173- 76. Dr. Lucier pointed to the S\u00f8renson article as support for the potential for a cardiac event as an adver se effect of thimerosal-c ontaining vacci nes, because such study noted the symptoms of \"heart rate varia bility and effects on blood pressure \" observe d at levels that Dr. Lucier says \"would have been exceede d in the case of thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines,\" because those symptoms are \"risk factors, certainly , for adver se cardiac outcomes.\" Tr. 1 at 181. He qualified this opinion, howeve r, saying, \"Whether or not the y would be suff icient to cause death, that' s for a cardiologist to examine.\" Tr. 1 at 182. Dr. Lucier appar ently fell into specula tion when he opined the substantiality of thimerosal as the prove rbial \"stra w that broke the ca mel's bac k\": Q You said that they are already at risk that they have exceede d the safe levels befor e they are even born. Why do you believe it's the thimerosal -containing vaccines that tip these children over the edge or cause cardiac arrest as opposed to the breast mil k, which also c ontains mercur y? A Any addit ional exposure, whether it's from thimerosal, whether it's from breast milk, could tip them over the edge. I'm just saying that it's clear that thimerosal has tipped some of the kids over the e dge. ...What I'm saying is that we do know, with great certainty , what the exact dose was that the infants received, and we know what the current levels are in the population, and, there fore, we know that the addition of thimerosal-co ntaining vaccines has pushed some of those individuals over the top in the case of merc ury toxicity. Whether other things have pushed them over the top or not is another issue, but not relevant today . Tr. 1 at 184. The Court is not aware wher e in his testimony Dr. L ucier provided the basis for this opinion. W hen questioned on this point, Dr. L ucier vaguely alluded to \"the N ational Aca demy of Science s,\" but stated that ultimately , the basis for this claim was \"all just logic ... irrefutable logic \": If you already have 60,000 people, babies, born each year from mothers who have too much merc ury in their bodies, an additional burden to those kids is going to cause an additional proof of children to be put at risk for merc ury-related diseases. The National Academy of Science s stated that there are 60,000 babies born at risk. The Centers for Disease Control have said that eight percent of the women in this country currently have me rcury levels that ar e above the safe level. -32-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 32 of 177So I don't think it takes any stretch -- this is pure, irrefutable logic -- that any additional exposure will put you at an additional risk. It's sort of like if you drink five beers at home, you have five beers at home, you have a blood alcohol content of .07, and then you go to a bar and have another beer, it puts you at .09. You say, \"Wel l, I only had one beer at the bar, so it wasn't the beer that cause d the effec t.\" You already have a starting point that is many of the babies are already at the edge. Any additional merc ury exposure will put them at risk. Tr. 1 at 185-86. Dr. Lucier soon after conce ded that those 60,000 children discussed by the National Academy of Scienc es we re state d to be \"a t risk for neural behavioral outcomes,\" and not \"cardiac arrest or sudden infa nt death sy ndrome or sudde n death.\" Tr. 1 at 187. Respondent challeng ed the contention in Dr. Lucier's expert report that \"the developing brain is a approx imately five to 10 times more sensiti ve to developmenta l neurotoxic effects of organic merc ury than is the adult brain.\" Tr. 1 at 187. Dr. Lucier clarified that by that, by \"deve loping,\" he meant the prena tal brain, because organ systems are more vulnera ble when developing than they are befor e or after that development, and that he drew that figure from the studies of Japane se Minamata Bay wher e children \"in utero seeme d to have the most damag e.\" Tr. 1 at 187-89. He added that \"it's almost as much with infant damag e but considera bly less with adults.\" Tr. 1 at 188. He quoted from the abstrac t of Pet. Ex. 18, Tab QQQ, Patricia M Rodier, Developing Brain as a Target of Toxicity , 103 E NVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES 73-76 (1995 Suppl. 6), re ading : The human brain forms over an unusually long period compar ed to other organs. Whil e most of the basic structure is laid down befor e birth, neuron prolifer ation and migr ation continue in the postnatal period. The blood-brain barrier is not fully develope d until the middle of the first year of life. The number of synaptic connec tions betwee n neurons reaches a peak around age two and is then trimmed back [by about half]. [Similarly , there ] is great postnatal activity in the development of receptors and tr ansmitter sy stems, as well as the pr oduction of my elin. Many of the tox ic ag ents known to damag e a developing brain interfe re with one or more of those developmenta l proce sses. Those with [antim itotic] action, such as x-ray ... and methy l merc ury, have distinctly differ ent defects on structure [] depending upon which neurons are forming at the time of exposure. Vulnera bility to agents that interfe re with cell production dec rease[es] rapidly over the early postnatal period. Tr. 1 at 191-92. All of the studies proff ered in support of this contention mentioned methy l merc ury by name, not ethyl merc ury. Tr. 1 at 192. Dr. L ucier could not say whether most of the populac e has as frequent environmental exposure to ethyl merc ury as it does wit h methy l merc ury. Tr. 1 at 193-95. Respondent's questioning of Dr. Lucier on the Charleston study led to the following intercha nge: Q Okay . Is there any eviden ce that you've pointed to today that inorg anic merc ury in the brain resulting from thimerosal-c vaccines cause s neurolog ical damag e? Any peer-review ed article s that conclude that the inorganic merc ury from thimerosal- containing 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 33 of 177A No. I would refer you, though, to the Burbache r article , who said the long retention in the brain meant that the safety of thimerosal could not be judge d by blood levels of ethy l mercur y beca use the half-life of inorg anic mercury within the brain wa s so much longe r. Tr. 1 at 198. Respondent pursued Dr. Lucier to differ entiate methy l merc ury, which had been studied in detail for adverse effects, from ethyl merc ury, which has not been so studied, but Dr. Lucier returne d to his point that the two are more or less identical in that, when metabolized, they both end up as inorg anic merc ury as their metabolite, which is unquestionably harmful (in one dose or another ) to ce lls. Tr. 1 at 198-200. Respondent's questionin g next turned to acute lethal outcomes of merc ury toxicity. Dr. Lucier could not point to a reference discussing sudden death following inorg anic merc ury exposure in the brain. Tr. 1 at 201. When querie d for \"any repor ts of incre ased rates of either sudden infant cardiac arrest\" in the Minamata and Iraq data, Dr. Lucier responde d that, \"The y only referred to numbers of deaths,\" and that the authors did not repor t \"the cause of death.\" Id. He conce ded that all who died in those mass exposures received \"fairly high\" doses, and admitted that he was \"not aware of any\" peer-r eviewe d medical lit erature establishing a highe r proportion of \"cardiac arrest or sudden infa nt death [among ] children who re ceive ontaining va s.\" Id. Dr. Lucier conce ded, regarding the Faroe Islands data (used by the EPA to calculate the \"safe dose\" ), that the neurolog ical finding s measure d by the researchers via neuropsy chologic testing52 were not manifestly observa ble neurolog ical defic its, but were only discovere d by the nuance d testing. Tr. 1 at 203-04. From there , Respondent asked Dr. Lucier to compar e the amount of merc ury exposure typical among the Faroe Island test subjects with the amount of ethyl merc ury in a Hepatitis B vac cine. He answe red: [T]here was a g radation of ex posure in the Faroe s, and I think the cord blood level effects we re seen at roughly 20 microg rams per liter.... In the case of thim erosa l, I think I went throug h the estimates from the Pichichero data that there was probably 20 microg rams -- 16 microg rams per liter would have been a reasonable extrapolation of the fact that he didn't take any samples until two half-lives had exceede d, so it would have missed the pea k exposure by roug hly two half-lives f or the initial 2.2 days that represents the blood half-life . So the real exposure would be 16 microg rams per liter in that case . Then there was the additional relationship to the brain. If you're conce rned with the brain being the target organ, then the ratio betwee n the blood and the brain has to be corrected for in the thimerosal case because that number is highe r. It's preferentially The EPA reference dose is a ten-fold reduction from a dose which, when pregnant mothers consumed it, was52 producing adverse effects in their children, measured once they were born. Tr. 1 at 215-217. This is not the same thing as a threshold dose: A threshold dose says it's a dose below which no effects will occur. The reference dose is a virtually safe dose, which means that there will be very few individuals who will be affected below that dose. Tr. 1 at 218. -34-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 34 of 177retained in the brain, and that adds a factor of, again, almost two, so you get up close to a functional level of about 30 microg rams per liter, which, again, exceeds the EPA safe level. Tr. 1 at 205- 06. As noted supra , the C ourt does not ac cept Dr . Lucier 's critique of the Pichicher o article , nor hi s extrapolation there from. Additionally , the C ourt can find no support in the record for a two-fold differ ence in rate of brain re tention for ethy l versus methy l mercur y, and Dr. Lucier did not provide a pe rsuasive suppor ting r eference for that claim. When asked to list the most likely neurolog ical defic its a person would be at risk for if their merc ury intake excee ds the EPA safe dose eve ry day, Dr. L ucier stated: You might get a little hyperactive, you might have a slight chang e in blood pressure , based on the other Grandjean study , in terms of blood pressu re. You might feel a little heart rate varia bility because, reme mber, that happene d at blood levels betwee n one and 10 microg rams per liter, and we don't know i f children are more sensit ive than adults for tha t effe ct. Tr. 1 at 224- 25. Respondent called into question whether ethyl merc ury could be considere d equally toxic as methy l merc ury, inasmuch as Dr. Lucier had previously stated his opinion that the two had differ ent toxic attributes that roughly balanc ed out to an equally potent level of toxicity. Dr. Lucier53 conce ded that no peer-reviewed study had pronounce d ethyl merc ury to be more toxic than methy l merc ury, but alluded to a study from the FDA concluding \"that ethyl and methy l merc ury need to be considere d equitox ic.\" Tr. 1 at 225-26. Respondent presse d Dr. Lucier to comment upon the Magos article (Pet. Ex. 18, Tab YY at 260), which states in its abstrac t that \"ther e was little differ ence in54 the neurotoxiciti es of methy l and ethyl merc ury,\" but finding that methy l merc ury is approximately 20% more toxic than ethy l mercur y. Tr. 1 at 227- 28. Dr. Lucier himself stated it thusly:53 One argument is that ethyl mercury might be less toxic than methyl mercury because it is, in fact, dealkylated and cleared from the blood more readily, although [the Magos] article doesn't address where that mercury is going. It may be going into other tissues, it may be going to the heart, it may be going to the liver, or it may be going to the spleen. It may be going a lot of places that we would be concerned about. All he knows is it is disappearing from the blood. So that's an issue. But, on the other hand, his study shows that there is greater retention in the brain of inorganic mercury that's formed from the ethyl mercury in comparison to what happens with methyl mercury. So that would cause an increased concern, and I think those two concerns are going in opposite directions. I believe they balance themselves out, and I think, in the absence of any data to the contrary, they have to be considered equitoxic for the use and risk assessment, and since they both are neurotoxicants, they both have the same common metabolite, they have similar structures dealing only in the alkyl chain length. The methyl mercury data are appropriate for use in risk assessment. Tr. 1 at 231-232. Pet. Ex. 18, Tab YY, L.

Dr. Lucier defended relianc e upon such studies, stating the following regarding their application: One way is as a presc reen. Pharmac eutical companies would do this with their new drugs. They have a list of things. I f they gave a new drug to any of these sy stems, and they found effects at this level, do you know what would happen with that drug? It would be tossed out the window because of fear of an adver se effect. So they use it as a screening tool. The other way it can be used is to help substantiate what might be an inconclusive result in animal experiments. What this provides is biologic plausibilit y, which is one of the criter ia for c ausality . One thing you would not use it for is if you only had in vitro data, you would not conclude anything a bout he alth risks with tha t data alone. What y ou're using it for is in conjunction with your entire amount of data to make an overa ll toxicolog ical evalua tion, and that's what I 've done here , and that's wha t's customary . These in vitro studies have not looked s pecif ically at the cardiac system. The only one that's probably relevant to that, in terms of cardiac arrest, would be the number four, the Sebashe study , in which it compar ed thimerosal and methy l merc ury to disrupt normal cellular calcium levels, and cellular calcium levels are involved in cardiac f unction. Tr. 1 at 244- 45, 247-48. 2. Thomas M. Connor, M.D. Dr. Thomas M. Connor is a physician by profession, pediatric cardiology in specia lty. Transc ript of Procee dings convene d on 10 June 2008 (Tr. 2) at 356. He summarized his profe ssional backg round thusly : I have a Bache lor of Scienc e, biol ogy major, chemistry minor; a medical degree in 1966, followed by an internship at Grasslands Hospital, which is now New York Medica l College , wher e I did a rotating internship which included obstetrics, surgery, internal medicine, pediatric s, emer gency room; two and a half year as a pediatric resident. In 1970, I was accepted for a fellowship by Norm Towner at Yale New Have n Medical Center wher e I spent two years in pediatric cardiology . After I finished pediatric cardiology , I was then broug ht to the Nava l Hospital at Bethesda, Mary land, wher e I became chief [of] pediatric cardiology from 1972 to 1986. During my time here, I was also part of Children's Hospital, National Medica l Center. I was also an assistant profe ssor at Geor ge Washington University . Later, in 1976, when they opened up USIS, which is Uniform Servic es Medica l, I was then br ought on as the coordina tor of pediatric cardiolog y for the Army , Navy , Air Force public health. I then achie ved a rank of assistant profe ssor at USIS. When I left in 1986, went to New Jersey wher e I joined the staff of Children's Hospital of New Jersey as an -36-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 36 of 177associate in pediatric cardiology . We were affiliated with UMDMJ which is the medical sc hool [ assoc iate prof essor. In ... 1988, I went to St. J oseph's Medic al Center in New J ersey, and was the chief of pediatric cardiology there . We had rotations with people from Seton Hall. I was given the rank of associate profe ssor of gradua te medical educa tion at Seton Hall University . Later, when we were trying to affiliate with Columbi a Presby terian, I was on their staff as an assistant profe ssor of pediatric s, clinical pediatrics. Later, forgot the exact date, Mary Ellen Engle at Cornell grante d me a clinical associate profe ssorship in pediatrics. Tr. 2 at 357-58. Dr. Connor is \"boar d certified in pediat rics, and ... board certified in pediatric cardiology ,\" the pr actice area he ha s worked in f rom 1970 to the prese nt. Tr. 2 at 358, 360. Dr. Connor began his testimony by discussing relevant facts in the clinical course of Thomas Kolakowski, from his birth to his untimely death. Thomas was born at 39 weeks (full term) at a weig ht of eig ht pounds, twelve ounces, with a n Apgar score of nine a t both one and five minutes. Tr. 2 at 360-61. The day after his birth (the 18th), he was vaccinated for Hepa titis B. Tr. 2 at 361. By the 19th, his mother alleg edly began to notice odd behavior or symptoms in Thomas, which she referred to as \"tremors,\" to which Dr. Connor added, \"jitteriness is difficult to separ ate out from tremors.\" Tr. 2 at 361-62. Dr. Connor stated that Mrs. Kolakowski later raised a conce rn about an irregular, asymmetrical startle response in Thomas, althoug h Dr. Connor admitted that he did not55 \"see it addresse d in the phy sician's note\" from that time. Tr. 2 a t 362. Dr. Connor recounted that, at a doctor's visit on 24 December 1998, the pediatric ian noted healthy weig ht ga in, and that \"Onc e again a star tle ref lex was broug ht -- was not a ddresse d per se, but he did also have loose bowel movements.\" Tr. 2 at 363. The Court rema ined unclea r as to whether Dr. Connor was opining that a conce rn about Thomas' startle reflex was or was not raised. This ambiguity persisted: On December 24-25, the grandmother or mother-in-la w bring s up some rema rks about the tremors. Once again, we have Christmas day. Nothing can be done about it. On the 26th, mom calls the baby 's doctor again because she felt something wasn't correct. I have nothing really in the way of any notes that this was convey ed to the chart. On New Year's Day, which was De cembe r 31st, basica lly passes, a nd the child is seen for the first time after that phone call on the 2nd of Januar y. Once again there is a very short note. Ther e were no pr oblems noted on that note. The doctor was silent as to whethe r or not the mother raised a ny conce rns. Dr. Connor explained the concern where a startle response is asymmetrical:55 When you have a startle response that is in question, then you begin to look for peripheral injury, whether it's been an arm or a leg, whether it's a muscle, a tear, a neurological injury such as an injury to the brachial plexus, for instance, or that you have a cerebral injury. Tr. 2 at 362. -37-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 37 of 177Tr. 2 at 363- 64. Continui ng on, Dr. Connor recounted that Thomas was administered his second Hepa titis B vaccine on 20 Januar y 1999, at 34 days old, at which time any newbor n jitteriness should have passed, a nd jerky , involuntary movements would have become suspect. Tr. 2 a t 364. [A]ccording to the mother's note on that visit, she broug ht up that he was not feeling well, that he ha d diarrhe a, he w as passive, a nd that's when he got the second shot. Now, they also broug ht up the incidents of tremors and basica lly at that point we have a trans ition timeframe . Going to the jitteriness of newbor ns, particula rly full-term newbor ns, jitteriness is generally there for a few weeks.... Jitteriness now become s a tremor that become s in question the possibil ity of ce rebral injury . Tr. 2 at 364- 65. Following that visit, said Dr. Connor repor ting from the affidavit of Mrs. Kolakowski, Thomas showed an incre ase in these so-ca lled tremors and Thomas was not eating healthfully , which Dr. Connor descr ibed as \"subtle signs of a baby that is possibly sick, and has just received a vaccination.\" Tr. 2 at 365. Simi larly, Dr. Connor stated that, following that second Hepa titis B vaccination, Mrs. Kolakowski had to tend to Thomas more than usual, in order for him to go to sleep. Id. During one such time, Mrs. Kolakowski wa s holding Thomas to soothe him to sleep a t around 3:30 in the morning , and herself fell aslee p, only to awake to find that Thomas was not breathing proper ly, which prompted her to call for help from Mr. Kolako wski and emer gency medical se rvice s. Tr. 2 at 365-66. When E MTs arrived, they noted Thomas to be without a pulse, apneic , his skin still warm, but w ith flaccid extremiti es, dilated pupils, and blood coming from his mouth; there were no signs of trauma. Tr. 2 at 366. Their attempts to clear the airwa y of blood, or to resusc itate Thomas, were unavailing . Id. Dr. Connor restate d the EMT impression of \"cardiac arrest, wh[ich] was stated by a trained profe ssional on the scene .\" Id. Resuscitation attempts continued on the way to the hospital and upon arrival, but were ultimately unavailing , and Thomas was pronounce d dead, wher eupon EKGs we re recorded: [O]n the EKGs that the patient had after they stopped the CPR , one would see some agonal rhythm, showing that the heart was in the mode of dying at that time. Agonal rhythms are usually descr ibed as slow. They are descr ibed with the complexes, QRS complexes Y , AT can have prolong ed QT intervals, but the se cannot be used in the diagnosis of a ca rdiac injury . This is really what y ou would see a t the end of life . ...Ag onal rhythm became obvious after the CPR was deter mined to be nonproductive and that the child was clinically dead. The agonal rhythm can be seen after death for a period of time. But if the child had been dead for a longe r period of time befor e EMT arr ived, there would not have be en an a gonal rhy thm. Tr. 2 at 366-67. Dr. Connor summarized his opinion of the moment of Thomas' death, that \"the child may have died just shortly befor e mother awoke , or may have had a cardiac arrest shortly befor e mother a woke.\" Tr. 2 at 367. -38-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 38 of 177Dr. Connor summarized the a utopsy : [T]he autopsy showed, at least on sever al organ systems, the brain, the heart, the liver, that there was enlar gement; that these were signific antly enlar ged, and as they looked throug h the system, they looked throug h the child's body . They looked with x-rays. They found no injury to the skeletal system. They examined the brain. They examined the lungs. They examined the heart. They examined the GI tract, and they found no appa rent a bnormalities to expl ain the child's de ath. ...The forensics patholog ist found no -- as far as abuse goes, they found nothing wrong specific ally with the child, but there was a conce rn that this child had received in the interim two Hep. B vaccinations, and felt that these neede d to be investiga ted further . Tr. 2 at 368. Following his restate ment of the medical record, Dr. Connor stated his general opinion upon causa tion: \"Tha t merc ury contained in these vaccinations can have cardiovascular effects.\" Tr. 2 at 369. Dr. Connor then went into some detail, discussing the controlled timing which the central56 nervous sy stem exercises over the hea rt's ac tivity : The general pacemaker that usually all of us have and rely on is the sinoatrial node. 57 It is the portion of tissue that goes throug h its electrical discharg e quickly . It returns quickly to baseline. It is ready to receive the next beat, and transmitted direc tly into the heart, and keep a rhythm of the heart regular and keep the heart, and this will respond to dema nds for the he art to incre ase its [rate] and dec rease its rate. ...[T] he conduction system itself shows in this particula r picture that the sinoatrial node goes throug h the internodal pathway s to carry the electrica l impulse in neurolog ical type tissue to the AV-node , which is the stopping station befor e the58 electrical current is distributed into the ventricle s. From that particula r point, the See also Pet. Ex. 20, Dr. Connor's Expert Report, at 4:56 In my opinion, Thomas Kolakowski's death, more probably than not, was caused by the mercury contained within the vaccines that were administered to him on Days 2 and 33 of life. Early in his life, he demonstrated subtle signs of mercury toxicity which his care providers did not recognize since it was not known at the time that vaccines contained a mercury preservative. The sinoatrial node is \"a microscopic collection of atypical cardiac muscle fibers (Purkinje fibers) at the57 superior end of the sulcus terminalis, at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium. The cardiac rhythm normally takes its origin in this node, which thus is known also as the cardiac pacemaker.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 1276 (emphasis in original). The atrioventricular node is \"a small area of specialized cardiac muscle cells and fibers that receives the58 cardiac impulses from the sinoatrial node and passes them on toward the ventricles, introducing a delay in impulse conduction. It is located in the right atrium between the tricuspid valve and the orifice of the coronary sinus, is composed of a meshwork of (Purkinje) fibers continuous with the atrial muscle fibers and the bundle of His, and is supplied by a branch of the right coronary artery.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 1272. -39-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 39 of 177electrical current is then put into the bundle of hysts [sic] which is in the septu m betwee n the rig ht and left ve ntricle. ..[The s]eptum is the wall that begins at the AV valves. The right-sided one i s the tricuspid. The lef t-sided one is the mitral. The septum then continues down to the tip of the heart or the apex of the heart and completes the wall dividing these two chambe rs from each other . The electrical impulse coming down throug h the right bundle along the septal wall, goes to the tip of the heart and then carries back the outside wall of the ventricle towards the tricuspid valve. The left bundle goes to the apex, enter s into the left ventricula r wall, and carries impulse from the apex back to the mitral valve. Tr. 2 at 370- 372. As for a normal hea rt rate , Dr. Connor qua lified: Basically the range in adults can be betwee n 60 and 100. In infants, it will be differ ent. It will be highe r because they normally have -- their hearts will run at a much hig her rate be cause of the smaller volume of the ve ntricles. Tr. 2 at 370. Dr. Connor moved from there to discuss how an Electroca rdiogram (EKG) can physically locate he art abnormalities, beca use diffe rent portions of the heartbeat's wave function correspond to differ ent sec tions (chamber s) of the he art: The first portion of the EKG, which shows a small hump, is that of the atrial contra ction and forms what they call the P-wave . The P-wave is wher e the electrical impulse begins in the SA-node. As it trave ls throug h the interatr ial conduction system you see a flat line, which is the baseline. That's called the PR segment. This is the time that it require s to go from the SA-node into the AV-node across the atrium. Gene rally, they can be less than 200 microsec onds. Anything over 200 microsec onds in the adult world can be conside red a block, a first degree block, et cetera. The next portion that you see is the dip. The dip in there is called the Q-wa ve. The Q-wa ve itself is wher e you begin the electrical pathway or the electrical impulse from the AV-node down the septal wall. The Q-wave then turns, goes into a large, tall R-wave . This is the electrical impulse throug h the ventricle . It depends on wher e the electrodes are located on the precardia l leads as to what this R-wa ve intends. If the electrical wave s are being read from V-5 and V-6, this R-wave represents the left ventricle . If you are dealing with V-1, V-2, V-3, this would represent the right ventricle . As the electrical activity goes throug h and the R-wave returns to baseline, you have a dip below the line. The dip below the line is important because basica lly that is reflecting information of the contra latera l ventricle . If it's left for the R, the S-wave59 Contralateral means \"situated on, pertaining to, or affecting the opposite side.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 414. 59 -40-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 40 of 177is for the right ventricle . If the R-wave is reflecting the right ventricle , then the S-wave is refle cting the left ve ntricle. Then at the point wher e the S-wave comes back to the isoelectric line, the straig ht line you see at the bot tom there , is wher e you have what t hey call the J-point. The J-point is wher e all electrical activity has begun to cease, and now you're beginning the repola rization process. The repola rization proce ss goes from the beginning -- from the J-point throug h the isoelectric point throug h the next large hump, which is the T-wa ve, and tha t then is the completion of the ele ctrica l cycle. Tr. 2 at 373-75. In particula r, study ing the P-wave is useful for detec ting a defect or irregularity in the atria : [T]he P-wave basica lly should be under 2.5 millimeters. When it is 2.5, more than 2.5 milli meters, you begin to look at the possibility that you're dealing with an enlar gement of the small pumping chambe r. If it is particula rly tall P-wave s on the right side, y ou are conce rned about the pos sibili ty that there may be hig h pressure s in the right ventricle , which y ou can see in cases of pul monary hyperte nsion. You can see that also when the valves leak and enlar gement of the atrium once again, the tall P-wave s will discern enlarg ement of the right atrium. If the P-wave looks like the letter \"M\" wher e it's wider and delay ed, it may be what they call a P-mitral, which mea ns the left atr ium is enlarg ed. Tr. 2 at 376- 77. Dr. Connor's dire ct examination continued in this vein: Now, when you get to the AV-node , basica lly the distance betwee n the beginning of the P-wave and the beginning of the Q-wa ve is what they call a PR segment. Normally speaking , the PR segme nt should show up with a faster heart rate. In the case wher e you have this elong ated, then you begin to look for the possibili ty of a disease proce ss in the muscle and electrical system, giving you a part of atrial block. Q Doctor, when you look at the PR interval, is that an indic ation that there is some sort of defect within the conduction system betwee n the SA-node and the AV-node ? A Yes. Q And could y ou tell the Court what the QRS complex represe nts? A Once again, this repre sent[s l eft] ventricular contra ction.... Q And t hen, Doctor, on this EKG, after the QRS complex , there is a line that leads into another little bump. What is that li ne ca lled? A That's called ST segment. It is part of the repola rization proce ss that begins after the c ontrac tion is complete. Q ...[W ]here the repolar ization? 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 11/23/10 Page 177A Basically betwee n wher e the S-wa ve comes into the isoelectric line, carried to the T-wa ve, and throug h the T-wa ve to wher e it comes back to the isoelectric line. That is called the ST segment, and the T-wa ve, the \"repo\" is the phase[] of repola rization of the ventricle , and basic ally it tells us how the muscle is behaving . ST segments are particula rly important when you're looking at ischemic chang es. 60 They do not act correctly . They can either be eleva ted or they can be dropped below the isoelectric line, and they tell you that there is something wrong with the way the heart is recha rging itself. Q And Doctor, you spoke about the T-wav e earlier. What does the T-wa ve represent? A The T-wa ve is a part that is divided initially into wha t they call the absolute refractory period. This is a time wher e you cannot stimul ate the heart to contra ct, and then at the apex of the T-wa ve you start enter ing into what they call the relative refractory period. A relative refractory period is important because basically stimul us at this point either from outside source s or from abnorma l beat or beats that run into the relative refractory period, and initiate abnorma l heart rates. Examples are ventricula r tachycardia.61 Q Doctor, would it be fair to state that once the T-wa ve begins its downwar d slope that's the pe riod of re lative re fractory ? A Yes. Tr. 2 at Continui ng onwar d, Dr. abnorma lities are compar ed: The PR-seg ment and ST segment are on the same isoelectric line. The T-wa ve, when it goes back, should be on the same isoelectric line. As long as they are in those areas, your PR-segment basica lly -- I'm sorry -- your isoelectric line is telling you that these segments are in their normal position. It's when they vary in the PR-seg ment befor e the QRS or the ST segment after the QRS are raised above or below the isoelectric line outside the P -wave and outside the T-wave b egins to tell you that there is a distortion going on. Tr. 2 at 380. Ischemia is the \"deficiency of blood in a part, usually due to functional constriction or actual obstruction of60 a blood vessel.\" DORLAND'S, 954. excitation (wide61 QRS complexes), usually in excess of 150 per minute, which is generated within the ventricle and is most commonly associated with atrioventricular dissociation. Minor irregularities of rate may also occur. Evidence implicates a reentrant pathway as the usual cause.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 1850. -42-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 42 of Connor elabor the interval\" as a diagnostic metric: QT interval is what you look at to deter mine whether or not that it falls within a certain normal pattern, and the general rate, the QT intervals that by themselves can vary with heart rates. The QT interval, if it is given out, may have a distance in them that can vary according to the size of the child, the rate of the heart rate at that point, and when you look at this you're looking to see is there a way that there is something going on tha t might make this QT inter val long er. Now, the older method was just measure the QT interval by itself, and then compar e it to known standards of what would be considere d a norm. Howeve r, peop le felt that this was clumsy , so they corrected the heart rate to 60. There is a mathematica l formula wher e the QT interval would give you a number that will vary anywhere from 380 to 440. QT interva ls corrected to a heart rate of 60 become s called Q TC, corrected QT intervals. This is a simpler tool to use because the standard is the same for every body from child to adult wher eas the QT by itself varie s according to age and weig ht of the child. So the QT corrected is what we use today to look for a problem. Normally speaking , QTs that are above 440 milli seconds are considered a border line. You know, keep an eye on it. QTs above 480 are beginni ng a prolong ation. QTs over 500 makes the refractory period much wider and more easily attacke d so that if there should happen to be an abnorma l heartbeat going on in the area of the QT correct -- the widened relative refractory period, that particula r individual can have an abnorma l heart rate begin. An example would be an extra beat, a prema ture ventricula r contra ction. If it lands in the relative refractory period, it can initiate and take ove r the c ontrol of the hea rt. Tr. 2 at 382-84. Dr. Connor the n spoke to the dang ers threa tened by an abnorma lly prolong ed QT interval: You can have prema contra ctions and basically those prema ture contra ctions landing outside of the absolute refractory period become less of an issue than those who land inside.... At that point it chang es the electrical activity in the heart, and instead of going back to the pacemaker in the SA-node, that portion of the heart can take over the control of the heart, initiate an abnorma l heartbeat, but because it is not using the atrial/ventric ular combination, you would begin to drop the pressure s, the effective contra ction of the heart muscle is impaired, the blood pressure can drop, and other scena rios can take place , including syncope, which is a passing out episode, or it can go on past that into a atrial flutter, and then into a fibrillation, and at that62 point the blood pressure s are no longer working , the blood pressure drops out, the Atrial fibrillation is \"an arrhythmia in which minute areas of the atrial myocardium are in various62 uncoordinated stages of depolarization and due to multiple reentry circuits within the atrial myocardium; instead of intermittently contracting, the atria quiver continuously in a chaotic pattern, causing a totally irregular, often rapid ventricular rate.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 695. 11/23/10 Page 43 of 177flow of blood from the left ventricle drops, the flow into the corona ry circulation drops, ischemia takes place , myocardial injury occur s, and unless resusc itation is begun the conti nued loss of blood pressure and the continued loss of oxygenate d blood to the nervous sy stem will then result in cere bral de ath. Tr. 2 at 384-85. Dr. Connor agreed that \"the reason it is dang erous is because it allows the development of abnorma l rhythms.\" Tr. 2 at 385. Dr. Connor then classified the differ ent kinds of irregularities that arise from a prolong ed QT interval: [Y]ou can have a wide-ba sed QT interval which could involve the T-wa ve. You can have a double humped one whic h involves, once a gain, the division of the incre ase betwee n the repola rization of the being separ ated out from the repola rization of the other. There is indisti nct ones wher e the termination of the T-wa ve is difficult to interpre t because there can be a U-wa ve complex which could reflect proble ms with potassium and ca lcium. Tr. 2 at 386. The electrolytes potassium and sodium are important because \"potassium basica lly is important in the cell membrane active depolar ization wher e you exchang e sodium for potassium in order to allow for the contra ction to take place .... the alterna tion of the sodium pump can be as much of a cause of a problem for pr olonge d QT as potassium, but potassium by in large rules.\" Tr. 2 at 387. Much later , he stated on the same topic of the risk of a pr olonge d QT interva l: [With proce ss of the ventricle , and that when the relative refractory period is prolong [ed], it leave s it exposed to abnorma l conduction, and at that particula r point it sets the heart up for serious cardiac arrhythmia, such as a ventricular tachy cardia. In the cases where it self-te rminates, it's an a nnoy ance. In the ca se whe re it doesn' t, there is a de ath. Tr. 2 at 395- 96. Following his general discussion of the heart and its rhythms, and QT interval ir regularity in particula r, Dr. Connor began his discussion of his opinion regarding the effects of merc ury on the heart's proper functioning . The first article discussed by Dr. Connor was Dahha n, which studied63 \"people who were in Iran used seed grain that was contaminated with mercur y, and as a result had merc ury poisoning[, of which t]here were 42 patients involved, 28 we re unde r 20 y ears of age , all EKGs we re abnormal, and the y were broke n out into four g rades.\" Tr. 2 at 388-89. He explained the study 's results as follows: Well, basically , there were five grades, Grade 1 throug h Grade 4. Grade 1 wa s the mildest invol vement. The Grade 4 wa s the most severe involvement. Basically , in Grade 1, there were five cases wher e there were only slight chang es in the T-wa ve, which was the last of those complexes in the QT interval, were actua lly Pet. Ex. 18, Tab U, Shawkat S. Dahhan and Hussain Orfaly, Electrocardiographic Changes in Mercury63 Poisoning, 14 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY 178-183 (August 1964). -44-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 44 of 177half the size. This means that there was some impairment of the repola rization proce ss of the electroca rdiog ram. Howeve r, basica lly that would not get you into a lot of problems. Grade 2 was considere d modera te. There was 10 cases, and in this particula r case the ST segment, which it was the area betwee n wher e the S-wave ended and the T-wa ve began. It was supposed to be on the isoelectric line, which is seen -- on the reference -- seen befor e the P-wave and after the T-wa ve. That segment was either up or down. In these particula r cases ... that tells you that there [are] chang es going on in the repola rization proce ss that can be due to inflammation, which can alter the conductivity of the repola rization proce ss throug h the injured area. If the injured area is compromised with decreased oxygenation, that zone of injury will incre ase. Whether it goes up or down depends on wher e these leads are seen on the chest. Basically they will all lead to areas in the heart, whether it is focal or it is global. In the case wher e the T-wa ves are inverted, this, once again, tells you that the repola rization, the axle [sic] refractory period, and the relative refractory period are chang ed and their repola rization tells you that the electrical proce ss has been altere d by the way these T- wave s behave . Grade 3, in which there were 21 cases, is considere d severe. In those cases, all T-wa ves we re inve rted and in those particular T-wa ves y ou also had other chang es which were seen over the precordium which would suggest that there is a sever e64 myocardial injury , and when they talk about \"all\", they are talking about a global myocardial injury .

Dr. Connor discussed the types of arrhythmias observe d in the Dahha n study , including \"sinus arrhythmia,\" a chang e in atrial heartbeat that is somewhat voluntary , in that it is linked to inhalation (accelerates the heartbeat) and exhalation ( decelerates the heartbeat) in breathing by the vagus nerve, which is a cranial nerve . Tr. 2 at 391-92. Another form noted was65 \"ventr are \"sing le throug h a zone in the ventricle wher e there was a delay , and as a result there is a distortion of the QRS c omplex ,\" which are either isolated or multi-focal on the EKG, meaning the aberrant signa ls originate from differ ent locations within the heart, which would then indicate \"a more global involvement of the myocardium.\" Tr. 2 at 392. The relative dang er prese nted by such irregularities depends on wher e in the rhy thm cy cle they occur : The precordim is \"the region of the anterior surface of the body covering the heart and stomach; it comprises64 the epigastric region and the inferior part of the thorax.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 1499. The vagus nerve: \"descending through the jugular foramen, it presents as a superior65 and inferior ganglion, and continues through the neck and thorax into the abdomen. It supplies sensory fibers to the ear, tongue, pharynx, and larynx, motor fibers to the pharynx, larynx, and 181 Filed Page 45 of 177[W]hen you begin to see PVCs, this is an area wher e you can have injury that could either exacer bate with exercise. You could have these PVCs land in the wrong portion of the electrical complex, and in particula r, if it lands in the relative refractory cycle called R-on-T, in other words, when you see the R-wave of the abnorma l beat land on top of the T-wa ve, which is a repola rization one in the area of the refractory electroca rdiog ram, it generally doesn't give you a problem. But if that same abnorma l R-w ave lands on the relative refractory portion of the T-wa ve, that is, the portion wher e it's going down hill, then you can initiate a serious cardiac arrhythmia. Tr. 2 at 393. The Dahha n rese archers a lso observed othe r arrhythmias among those studied: They basica lly had alterna tion of the electrical conduction from the P-wave to the Q-wa ve, giving you various forms of heart block. There was also a short run of ventricula r tachy cardia encoun tered in two cases. A ventricula r tachy cardia obviously was a short run, so even though it was there it was self-te rminated, but right there y ou're no notice [ sic] that this is a more ser ious problem. Tr. 2 at 394. Based on this reading, Dr. Connor agreed that the Dahha n study subjects experience d cardiac sy mptoms i n addition to neurolog ical sy mptoms. Id. The relevance of those cardiac symptoms to the issue at bar was less clear. Whil e clear that \"only a portion\" of the people that were exposed to merc ury experience d these arrhythmias, Dr. Connor did not believe that this fact was \"an indication of a genetic susceptibility toward developing cardiac disorde rs\" in re sponse to merc ury exposure or toxicity. Tr. 2 at 394-95. He did a gree that \"there are genetic cases wher e you can have an abnorma l set of beats going into a ventricular arrhythmia, and resulting in sudden death in what appea red to be an otherwise normal heart,\" which would support causa tion independe nt of merc ury exposure, rathe r than indicate espec ial genetic susceptibility to mercur y poisoning. Tr . 2 at 395. The ne xt article of medical literature discussed by Dr. Connor was the Cinca a ining compound in fungicide resulted in contamination of meat products which were consumed by \" the study 's subjects, a f amily in Romania. Tr. 2 at 396. One son had poisoning so sever e that he lost the ability to walk, and had diffic ulty in talking and suffe red muscle wasting . Tr. 2 at 396-97. His electroca rdiog ram was irregular, and he died three days following admission to the hospital from merc ury poisoning, via cardiac arrest. Tr. 2 at 397. Another son evidenc ed simil ar symptoms (\"diff iculty walking , difficulty talking, difficulty walking , weakness, abnorma l reflexes\"), and, within 10 days of hospital admission, likewise died via cardiac arrest. Id. According to Dr. Connor's reading, the third child in the family ram which showed the fact that the ST segments were found below the isoelectric line, and were neg ative. There is not a big desc ription Pet. Ex. 18, Tab V, I. Cinca et al., Accidental ethyl merc ury poisoning with nervous system,66 skele tal muscle, and myoc ardium injury , (1979) . -46-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 46 of 177other than for the fa ct that this was a global type of ST segment chang e, indi cating that there would be some kind of an inflammatory or ischemic activity going on within the heart itself.... [A]ccording to the reading of the electroca rdiog ram, the reader ascertained that this was left ventricula r hypertrophy , which would be seen67 in the QRS complex, which is the large spike, generally found over the chest and reads 4, 5 and 6, which is on the outside of the prec ordial over the left ve ntricle. Tr. 2 at 397-98. The fourth subject was the family 's mother, who, Dr. Connor related, \"had weakness, abnor mal gait, muscle pains, basically she had unusual or abnorma l high eye movements.\" Tr. 2 at 398. He added that the result of her electroca rdiog ram was \"flattening of the T-wa ves in the precordial l ead which, i f we go back to the Dahhan article..., this would indicate a milder form of cardiac involvement.\" Tr. 2 at 398- 99. Most interesting for Dr. Connor, the two brothers that died in the Cinca study both suffe red from \"inter stitial my ocarditis\": There was invol vement of both in case one, and it wa s chronic, be cause this is one wher e the consumption of meat took place befor e the symptoms took place , and then from the symptoms to the involvement of the heart to the final death. I think that this is over a 28-day period of time. The finding s at the time of autopsy on both case one and case two was an interstitial -- the call it interstitial chronic myocarditis. ...[This68 i]ndicates that there is an inflammation within the myocardium which makes up the ventricula r walls of the hear t. Tr. 2 at 399. He added that the mention of \"chronic myocarditis\" meant that the myocarditis had persisted for longe r than 21 or 30 days. Tr. 2 at 400. Dr. Connor stated that the Cinca study \"supports [his] belief tha t ethy affects the c ardiova scular sy stem.\" Tr. 2 a t 400. The ne xt study discussed by Dr. Connor in explanation and support of his opinion was the Jalili article , which studied another Iraqi population that had consumed seed grain coate d with69 EMPTS, an ethyl merc ury-conta ining prese rvativ e (but not the same population studied by the Dahha n paper ). Tr. 2 at 402. He found \"indications of cardiovascular effects from the administration of seed g rain tre ated with ethy l mercur y.\" Id. He noted the following finding s: [T]here were sever al cases of irregular pulses, and very slow heart rates. In other cases, they once again showed ventricula r ectopic beats with prolonga tion \"hypertrophy of myocardium of a ventricle, due to chronic pressure overload;67 it is manifest electrocardiographically by increased QRS complex voltage, frequently accompanied by DORLAND'S, supra, at 890. Interstitial myocarditis is \"inflammation of the muscular walls of the ... affecting the interstitial68 fibrous tissue.\" DORLAND'S, supra, Resp. Ex. 27, M. A. Jalili and A. H. Abbasi, Poisoning by Ethyl Mercury Toluene Sulphonanilide,69 18 BRITISH JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE 303-308 (1961). Something is ectopic if it is \"located normal position.\" at 587.70 47 of 177interval, and depre ssion of the ST segment with T-wave inversion, which is a very serious involvement of the my ocardia. ...[Among the EKG readings,] there were six records wher e they had prolong ed PR intervals. They had irregular heart beat. The ST segment with the depre ssion, the ST segment and the inverted T-wa ves would indicate sever e myocardial damage.... They did 12 EKGs on 15 patients, six were within normal limit s, others showed involvement. Tr. 2 at 403. He agreed that some of those poisoned did not manifest cardiologica l symptoms, but only neurolog ical symptoms, and added that the neurolog ical symptoms observe d in the Jalili study were \"very simil ar to the neurolog ical injuries we just spoke about in Dahha n and in Cinca article s.\" Tr. 2 at 403- 04. 71 The last article Dr. Connor discussed was the Zhang article, among which he found the72 following case s cardiologica lly signific ant: Seven patients d prolong ed inter vals with depre ssion of the ST seg ment, inverted T-wa ves, and large E-wav es, which would be consistent with low serum potassium levels, and basica lly the EKG finding s are consistent with a toxic carditis. Tr. 2 at 404-05. These were signific ant to him because they demonstrated to him the following EKG abnorma lities: In the initial par t of the EKG, in the PR seg ment, there was a prolong ation above -- it would have to be above 200 milli seconds in order to have first degree AD block. So that involves the SA-node, the electrical activity throug h the atrial wall to the AV-node , which is wher e the ventricle s begin. So there is clearly involvement of the upper por tion of the small collecting chambe rs of the he art. On cross-examination, Respondent queried Dr. Connor on the differences between the Jalili study and others,71 and between individual subjects in the studies: Q Is it your opinion that the patients in the Jalili papers and the Dahhan papers were exposed to the same amount of mercury? A They were exposed to a similar type of mercury, yes. Q Isn't it likely that they were exposed to varying amounts of mercury? A Yes. Q Can the symptoms described in those papers then be attributable to the varying doses of mercury received by the study populations? A I don't know how to answer that one. Tr. 2 at 471-72. Pet. Ex. 18, Tab NNNN, Jimel Zhang, Clinical Observations in Ethyl Mercury Chloride Poisoning, 572 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE 251-58 (1984). -48-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 48 of 177The second one is that patient had prolong ed QT intervals which basica lly start at the point wher e the V-wa ve -- it looks like a small \"v\" on the electroca rdiog ram -- to the end of the T-wa ve. Once again, greater than 480 milli seconds using a corrected QT as a guideline. At this point they are also saying that the ST segments, which come at the end of the contra ction of the ventricle , that's were the S-wave comes into this segment, that connec ts the QRS complex to the T-wa ve. That ST segment once again is showing signs of inflammation or ischemia because it's raised or is lowered, de pending on wher e the lead is being read, indicating that there is an abnorma lity in the repola rization proce ss either from lack of oxygen, inflammation, injury . Tr. 2 at 405- 06. These article s of medical literature led Dr. Connor to conclude that \"ethy l merc ury can cause cardiovascula r abnorma lities,\" which \"can lead to cardiac arrest and death.\" Tr. 2 at 406. More specific ally, Dr. Connor conclude d that \"the ethyl merc ury which was contained in the two doses of thimerosal, which was in the Hepa titis B vaccine that Thomas received ... substantially contributed to [his] death.\" Tr. 2 at 406- 07. He e xplained the ba sis for his conclusion as follows: Well, first of all, the problem with giving vaccina tions on birth days is that you do get a very large dose of thimerosal in relation to the child. This is kind of a one size fits all. The big gest problem of one size fits all, and the timing of this is im portant because in the case wher e one size fits all you don't make any adjust ments for the weig ht. Number two, y ou're giving it in a ver y critica l timeframe in a child's entry into the world. The reason it's critica l is because for the first couple of weeks of life we are still going throug h the maturing proce ss of the infant. The cell membrane transport system is imm ature . The liver, w hich ca n produce protein that combined merc ury, are immature and there fore will not do the job. The kidney s are immature, cannot eliminate it. The GI tract is immature because it's in the proce ss of colonizing so that it can metabolize the bile in order to lock down the merc ury. At this point the amount of merc ury that is introduced ca n be extremely high a gainst standards. The second thing is you can have, as a result, sensitiz ation of the individual to the product, and when you have that occur ring you now begin the proce ss, an inflammatory -- antig en antibody proce ss that can begin to show as these article s, that the problem c an build over the next s everal wee ks. The second dose in a person that is alrea dy sensitiz ed to the ethy l mercur y can be a triggering of an extremely sever e reaction which can take place over a matter of hours, and at that particula r point from the autopsy there is involvement of the brain, there is involvement of the heart, there is involvement of the liver. These are all suggestions that there ha s been a n ong oing inf lammatory proce ss. Tr. 407-408. H e adde d some ca veats that a rose f rom the fa cts in this specific ca se: -49-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 49 of 177Basically , I'm dealing with the article s and I'm basica lly dealing with certain things that were a little bit problematic. One of the items that were problematic was the continued jitteriness of the child. Based on the development of children, jitteriness should subside in a few weeks. It did not according to the m other. Once you start to see jitteriness continue, then you begin to worry about the possibili ty that there is an involvement of the nervous sy stem. In the case of people having jitteriness with an usual startle response , then you begin to worry about t he possi bility that either the child is not hearing well or there is an injury in the brain stem. In those particula r cases the response then is abnorma l, and althoug h people don 't generally know s tartle response in the first child, they begin to learn, oh, is this a normal type of response , and in the course of conver sation, they can be told, y ou know, it's normal. I've looked at the medical record and I don't see referrals to it, so when one puts down nervous system, et al., and haven' t responde d to it, I don't know what it means, but I have to go with the Petitioner who said that she felt it was abnorma l. We have a third par ty, which is either a mother or a mother-in-la w, who felt it was not rig ht, and the f act that this is a sec ond time mother, she should know wha t to ex pect. Tr. 2 at 409- 10. On cross-e xamination, Dr. Connor admitted that he is not an expert in toxicolog y or medical toxicolog y, nor is he board-ce rtified in either specialty . Tr. 2 at 411. Thoug h he di d observe one case of merc ury poisoning in t he form of acrody nia during his pediatrics re sidency , he has ne ver73 diagnosed anyone with clinical symptoms of merc ury poisoning nor for \"toxi c exposures to chemicals, pharma ceutica ls or environmenta l toxins.\" Tr. 2 at 412-13. Among the nine peer- revie wed medical article s he has written, none were in the field of toxicolog y, none on either methy l or ethyl merc ury, none on thimerosal or vaccines, none on treating merc ury toxicity, none on the cardiologic se quela of ethy l mercur y. Tr. 2 at 413- 14. L ikewise, Dr . Connor does not c laim to be an expert in neurolog y, has not received specia l traini ng in neurolog y, is not board- certified in neurolog y, has not authore d medical literature in the field of neurolog y, and does not treat or diagnose neurolog ic conditions in his patients. Tr. 2 at 414. He has not authore d article s of medical literature on \"neur ologic effects of merc ury poisoning,\" \"the neurolog ical effec methyl exposure.\" Tr. 2 at 414-15. Similarly, Dr. Connor does not claim to be an expert in immunology , has not received specia l traini is in , and has not authore d medical lit erature in the field of immunology . Tr. 2 at 415. Moving to Dr. Connor's area of expertise, cardiology , regarding whether he has \"studied the effects of either ethyl merc ury or methy l merc ury on the heart,\" Dr. Connor stated that he had, as part Acrodynia is \"a disease of early childhood characterized by pink, swollen, painful fingers and toes;73 listlessness, irritability, failure to thrive, and photophobia; rashes, profuse perspiration, loss of teeth, and sometimes redness of the cheeks and tip of the nose. Most cases are toxic neuropathies caused by mercury poisoning; individual sensitivity may also be a factor.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 20. -50-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 50 of 177of his prepa ration for testimony in this matter, but tha t it was limit ed to reviewing relevant article s of medical literature , and did not extend beyond that. Tr. 2 at 415-16. Dr. Connor had not w ritten any article s, published in pe er-revie wed journals specia lizing in c ardiolog y, on the topic of effects on the heart from ethyl merc ury or thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines, nor on the cardiac nerve plexus in particular . Tr. 2 at 416. Dr. Connor agreed that \"dose is one of the most fundame ntal conce pts in the of cardiology .\" Tr. 2 at 417. He ag reed \"that presc ribing medications t hat are considered beneficia l at one dose can be toxic or lethal at another dose,\" and \"that toxicity occur s when the dose any substance is suff icient to cause adver se sy mptoms . 2 at 417-18. Dr. Connor c larified his opinion on ca usation: In the ca se of this ty pe of a situation, we can have a sensitiz ation, antibody antig en type reaction, which can take place at the tissue level, and does not necessarily have to be absolutely the merc ury in the hear t. Tr. 2 at 418. He added that this would mean an immunologic reaction to \"the products in the vaccination,\" such as the thimerosal, the antig en, or \"the breakdown components.\" Tr. 2 at 418. This led to the following , rathe r odd, interc hang e: Q When you say \"antig en\", are ce antig en? A Possibl when y ou say \"the br eakdow n components\", w hat ar e you speaking of specific ally? A Well, basica lly the components that make up a vaccination, which can be the antig en component, the ethyl merc ury. The ethyl merc ury can break down into -- I'm sorry , the t himerosal which can brea k down i nto ethyl merc ury and thiosalicy lates, and the a luminum hy droxi de. Q So any one of those components could be the source of the sensitiz ation and the inflammatory reaction that y ou spoke of? A They are components. Q But m y question was, any one of those components, i n your opi nion, could be the sourc e of the inflammatory reaction. A The inflammatory reaction can most likely be due to the ethyl merc ury, certainly the possibilit y of the a ntige n itself. Q What about the aluminum? A I don't know. Q So we're going to limit it to most likely the ethyl merc ury or the Hepa titis B surfa Yes. -51-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 51 of 177... Q And the mec hanism, in y our opinion, is an inflammatory reaction? A Yes. ... Q Was the first vacc ine the ca use of Thoma s Kolakowski's dea th? A The first vaccine can be the sensitiz ation. The second vaccine was the cause of the de ath. Tr. 2 at 418- 19. Respondent challeng ed Dr. Connor's expressed opinion, that \"Thomas Kolakowski suffe red an immunologic reaction to either the ethyl merc ury in the or the that \"the dose sensitized him and the second dose killed him.\" Tr. 2 at 422. Respondent's challeng e was premised upon the perceived absenc e of such a theory within Dr. Connor's written expert repor t, submitt ed prior to the hearing, but Dr. Connor believed that the immunologic theory was \"impli ed in the m ercury toxicity, and basically it was im plied in the fact [Thomas] received a vacc ination on the first day of life and again 33 days later.\" Tr. 2 at 423. He went on to explain his opinion on the relationship betwee n merc ury toxicity and immunologic reaction: Merc ury toxicity basica lly is the thimerosal which breaks down into the ethyl merc ury and to the thiosalicy lates. These elements can cause an im mune reaction, and these basica lly can create an inflammatory basis which can damag e cells, and at this particular point if it involves the hea rt, you will end up with a my ocarditis. Tr. 2 at 423. Furthermore , he agreed that dosage was a factor for both merc ury toxicity and immunologic re action: Simpl y by an increase d amount in the sy stem that normally might be a ble to adjust for smaller amount s in the case of infants wher e you have basica lly an intent to stimul ate the immune system which is what vaccines are intended to do, to stimul ate the immune system so that they can produce a response at a later date when the disease ta kes plac e. And at that particula r point I would say what can be a ther apy for one could be a poison f or another , particula rly when you are dealing with doses that are not individualiz ed but one size fits all, which is what this infant re ceive d. Tr. 2 at 424. When asked to explain the interplay of this immunologic response across the neurolog ic and cardiologic sy stems, Dr. Connor explained: [I]f you have an immunologic reaction in which you're going to have the production of the antibodies ... or the antig en can lock into the system, it can involve your immune system, your heart or the cardiovascular system, and the neurolog ical system. -52-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 52 of 177Tr. 2 at 425. Dr. Connor further explained his belief that this was an ongoing inflammatory proce ss, which began following administration of the first Hepa titis B vaccine, and continued until his untimely death: [T]he child had enlar ged cerebral edema , enlar ged heart, enlar ged liver, and these things usually are based on chronic ity; that is, you would have to have a period of time that the process was going on. It can be agg ravated and accelerated when t he next dose is put in place , and then the problems would begin -- the final stage would begin at that point. Tr. 2 at 426. Dr. Connor stipulated that such a mecha nism of inflammatory reaction \"is independe nt of the e ffects of mer cury on the bra in.\" Tr. 2 a t 427. Dr. Connor could not \"cite to any article s that show that inflammatory reactions in the heart are more common in children who received thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines than in children who have not.\" Tr. 2 at 427. Dr. Connor could not cite support for his expert repor t's asser tion that, \"The IOM has acknow ledged that merc ury can cause cardiac and respira tory adver se effects.\" Tr. 2 at 427-28. Respondent also challeng ed the statement within Dr. Connor's expert repor t that, \"Most article s have treated organic merc urials as one, and have not distinguished betwee n ethyl and methy l merc ury,\" regarding what he me ant by that statement: Basically , merc ury compounds are basica lly simil ar in nature . They are all toxic. There is no article s that show that they have a benef it. They basica lly are deleter ious to the body .... [However,] dose does ma tter also. Tr. 2 at 429.74 This led to the following interchange, which was useful for the Court's assessment of Dr. Connor's persuasive74 probity: Q Do organic mercurials have the same chemical properties? A I don't understand what the question would be. Q What organic mercurials are you referring to? A Basically, ethyl mercury and then you can have methyl mercury, and they have certain properties that are similar in nature. Q But do they have the same chemical properties? A I'm not a chemist. Q I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. A I'm not -- Q You're not a chemist? A -- a toxicologist. Q Okay. Do they have the same adverse effects on the body? A They can have the same adverse effects on the body. -53-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 53 of 177Dr. Connor did agree that the studies of mass merc ury poisonings in Iraq and the Minamata Bay of Japan \"involved exposure to high doses of methy l or ethyl merc ury compou nds due to ingestion of contaminated food,\" and that \"the amount of merc ury involved in these poisonings far exceeds the exposure to ethyl merc ury in thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines.\" Tr. 2 at 433. Dr. Connor's comment in his expert repor t, that, among those mass poisoning cases, \"significant numbers ... develop[ed] signs and symptoms which are not a ttributable to me rcury toxicity,\" those signs and symptoms he was referring to were \"involvement of the cardiovascular system as shown on the electroca rdiog rams.\" Tr. 2 at 433-34. He stipulated that the deaths repor ted in those studies were not immediate, but followed two to three or four weeks after merc ury exposure. Tr. 2 at 434. Q Does dose level matter? A Dose level would matter. Q Are there any articles you can refer me to that support your opinion that organic mercurials are treated as one? A I think Lucier is probably the one person who has looked at a lot of these particular products, and I'm relying on his statements that says that they do. ... Q Are you aware of any articles that distinguish ethyl mercury and methyl mercury? A Yes. Q And what articles are they? A Ethyl mercury -- (Pause.) THE COURT: Perhaps, ma'am, if you have a specific article in mind, you could indicate that. MS. DAVIS: I do not. I'm just asking the basis of his opinion, and if he knew of any articles that distinguish between them. (Pause.) THE WITNESS: There are two but I just don't remember where they are located. Tr. 2 at 429-30. -54-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 54 of 177Respondent's questioning unear thed some fundame ntal errors and unfounded leaps of logic in Dr. Connor's opinion. Whenever Respondent confr onted Dr. Connor with one of these,75 howeve r, Dr. Connor of ten answe red tha t he was not qua lified to opine on the topic. After noting Dr. Connor's statement about the half-life of methy l merc ury in his expert repor t, Respondent asked him if he knew how that compar ed to ethyl merc ury, which led to the following intercha nge: Ethyl merc ury by itself can clear in a shorter timeframe, but it accumulates over a longe r timefra me elsew here. It's not eliminated from the body .76 Q If we assume that for the sake of argument the half-life of ethyl merc ury is on the order of seven days, does that affect your opinion whether Thomas Kolakowski's death r esulted fr om his ex posure to thimerosal in his vac cines? A I don't know how to answe r that because basica lly you would have to be more of an immunologist in order to make that kind of judgme nt call. I'm not an immunologist. Tr. 2 at 435. Petitioners did not offe r any expert witness evidenc e on the subjec t of immunology . Dr. Connor's expert report stated, inter alia:75 A review of the literature has revealed some very interesting studies on the variation of the biologic half-life of methyl mercury in man. The range appears to be approximately 40 to 120 days, with an average of roughly 70 days. Exceptions were noted, however, which suggests that from a public health point of view, a certain group of people may face a much higher risk of a longer biological half-life than others with the same mercury burden. This indicates that there are individuals who may genetically be predisposed to a prolonged biological half-life.... ...While the early reports all treated the various forms of organic mercury alike, recent, improved methods of analysis seem to indicate that ethyl mercury in the same dosage as methyl mercury is much more potent. (Rosenstein, 1960; Sonsjn, 1973; Toxicity study for USPHS and EPA, 1989). In addition, it is important to realize that inorganic mercury in high exposures can cause death due to loss of respiratory function as a result of severe pulmonary damage (Campbell, 1948; Matthes, 1958; Tangerberman, 1959; Tenet, 1959). In these exposures, the animals suffered severe pulmonary edema within 24-48 hours following an acute exposure to inhaled forms of mercury. Recent data has indicated that depending on the age of the subject, ethyl mercury at the same blood level appears more toxic than methyl mercury. The increased toxicity appears to occur for several reasons: (1) ethyl mercury compounds take longer to cross the blood:brain barrier and achieve peak levels; (2) demethylation occurs in the central nervous system leaving higher amounts of inorganic mercury to accumulate in the CNS; (3) apoptosis (accelerated programmed cell death) and necrosis of cells occur simultaneously in ethyl mercury exposures rather than sequentially as in methyl mercury exposures; (4) ethyl mercury appears to be more lipophilic than methyl mercury thereby having a greater affinity for tissues which contain fat such as the nervous system tissue, the neuronal tissue, the deep cardiac nerve plexus. In addition, mercury can also affect the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems thereby affecting the regulation of cardiac speed, function, rhythm and contractility, timing intervals of the PR interval, and the QRS and QTC which affects the rhythmicity of the heart per se.

This statement is belied by the data from, inter alia, the Burbacher study, supra.76 -55-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 55 of 177Regarding Dr. Connor's reference in his expert repor t to a population segment genetically predisposed to merc ury toxicity, Dr. Conner stated that such a conce pt \"was alluded to in one of the [Iraqi mass poisoning] studies,\" but qualified that \"I can't quote exactly wher e the paper is loc ated at this point, but they did studies on people, and there was at least one case wher e it went to 189 days, and that was felt to be a genetic differ ence in those particula r individuals or that particula r individual,\" befor e finally admitting that genetic predisposition to merc ury toxicity was not proven or demonstrated in the paper 's finding s, but \"was specula tion.\" Tr. 2 at 435-36 (\"This was alluded to. It was specula tion.\"). When pr essed to sta te his opinion based on his own expertise, regarding whether \"genetica lly predisposed individuals are at the tail-end of the ... dose response curve ,\" Dr. Connor responde d, \"I have no way of telling because, once again, that's genetics medicine.\" Tr. 2 at 436-37. Dr. Connor stated that he based his statements on genetic predisposition on geneticists: Some of the information from there comes from the article s that were written for the PA. There is a tremendous amount of information on people who have had abnorma l response s to it, and it's alluded to that people are differ ent genetica lly, and would have a differ ent -- a nd some people ha ve a dif ferent re sponse. Tr. 2 at 437. Respondent also querie d Dr. Connor for support of his statement, in his expert repor t, that \"The exceptions were noted which suggest that from a public health point of view a certain group of people may face a much highe r risk of a longe r biologica l half-life than others with the same merc ury.\" Tr. 2 at 438. Dr. Connor could point to no specific support for that statement. Id. Regarding the facts of this case, Respondent asked Dr. Connor whether he believed \"that Thomas Kolakowski ha d a g enetic pr edisposition,\" and he r eplied that he did not, and tha t he wa s not awar e of a ny \"mer cury testing done on Thomas Kolakowski.\" Tr. 2 at 441. Dr. Connor a greed to the propositions that \"the route of exposure, meaning whether it wa s inhaled, ing ested or introduc ed via IV or subcutane ous ... is also important in assessing the effects in the body ,\" that \"the tox icokinetic profile of mercury exposure differ s depending on the form of merc ury, the route of exposure to the m ercury, [as well as the] size of the dose, ... [a]nd t he ag e at the time of exposure\" and that \"dose is an important factor in assessing the adver se effects.\" Tr. 2 at 441-42. There was some difficulty arriving at an understanding as to what Dr. Connor meant by his use of the word \"potent\" within his expert repor t's statement that \"Improved methods of analy sis seems to indicate that ethyl mercur y in the same dosag e as me thyl mercur y is more pot ent.\" Tr. 2 at 442 et seq. Dr. Connor began his explanation by citing \"a study done in 1985, I believe it was 1984-85, on rats which basica lly gave a very specific dose to these rats of methy l merc ury, of ethyl merc ury, and methy l merc ury basica lly shows that at two, four, six, eight, [and twelve] hours it had almost the same response as ethyl mercury.\" Tr. 2 at 442-43. Dr. Connor continued summarizing that article , as follows: Howeve r, when they continued on to 24 hours, methy l merc ury plateaue d off and dropped, ethyl mercury went up another 20 percent befor e it began to fall, which indicated that e thyl merc ury peaks out much l ater than methy l mercur y, and in that particula r case you are showing a differ ence in absorption, a nd you're showing that -56-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 56 of 177many of the studies done were done at two, four, six, and eight hours, and never completed their studies until -- at 12 or 24 hours. So that some of the information that was given over basica lly led to the belief that they both were acting simil arly when in fact there was a differ ence in the way they were absorbe d and the peak level of ethy l mercur y was fa r greater and later tha n that of methy l mercur y. Tr. 2 at 443. No r eference to such a n article was e ver pr ovided. Respondent then challeng ed Dr. Connor with Dr. Magos' 1985 article \"regarding and77 methy Dr. Connor ded, had \"conc lude[d] that at equal doses methy l merc ury is more toxic than ethyl merc ury.\" Tr. 2 at 443-44. Dr. Connor explained, \"the method of analy sis was altere d in 1985 by Dr. Magos. At that point they chang ed the extraction method of ethyl merc ury ...[such that] they were able to extract more ethyl merc ury than ... previously .\" Tr. 2 at 444. His summary continued: [A]t that point they actua lly were able to get more ethyl mercury out of the sample, which would imply that there was greater toxicity than previously anticipated.... Or greater amounts which may, as we were talking about dose-r elated, was now the knowledg e that the a mount was at a g reater dose tha n previously thought. Tr. 2 at 444-45. When asked if his opinion was that Dr. Magos' methodology was faulty , Dr. Connor replied: I'm saying Dr. Magos altere d the extraction method by chang ing the amount of stannous chloride to a lower amount so that they were extracting more ethyl merc ury than previously was done, and that by altering that they had a better method for identify ing how much of the e thyl mercur y was a ctually in the sy stem. Q But ultimately his conclusion was that in equal doses ethyl merc ury was less neurotoxic than methy l mercur y. A I don't rec all that.78 Tr. 2 at 445. Returning to the meaning Dr. Connor intended by his descr of the amount of ethyl merc ury was at a differ ent level than they previously thought. I don't know that that makes it more toxic because it was already being judge d, but it would tell you that there were highe r levels of ethyl merc ury than previously thought, and based on the previous analy sis if one were to look at a drug that you were study ing and you were trying to analy ze, and you found a specific level Pet. Ex. 18, Tab YY, L. Magos et al., The comparative toxicology of ethyl- and methylmercury, 57 ARCHIVES77 OF TOXICOLOGY 260-267 (1985). However, Dr. Connor had just stipulated to this summary of Dr. Magos' conclusion moments before. Tr. 278 at 444. -57-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 57 of 177that was no different than methy l, then you would say ethyl and methy l were the same. But if you basica lly come out and say that the ethyl was actua lly at a highe r dose than previously believed, and t he am ount used to obtain that or to make that dose gives you a highe r dose of ethyl merc ury than you previously thought, then the dose is important because it would have to be lower in order to be the same as methy l merc ury.... And larger amount of ethyl merc ury would imply that there was more ethyl mercur y available at that par ticular dose le vel than people understood. Q So the highe r amount ava ilable is the same a s potency to you? A No. Q What did y ou mean by more potent? A More a vailable. Tr. 2 at 446- 447. Regarding that same sentenc e of his repor t, Respondent querie d Dr. Connor as to what \"improved methods of analy sis\" he was referring to, which, to him, had indicated the greater potency of ethyl merc ury. Tr. 2 at 448. Dr. Connor's response was that the literature he cited for support was not applicable , but that \"the improved method of analy sis was basica lly Magos, 1985.\" Tr. 2 at 448- 49. When Respondent asked about the studies he listed in support, Dr. Connor conce ded, \"No, these were about methy l merc ury, and basically once ag ain bot h befor e the recognition that there was a differ ence ... for ethyl merc ury.\" Tr. 2 at 449. Ethyl merc ury was never studied by the paper s he referenced, and \"[t]hey only deal with methy l merc ury.\" Continuing on, Dr. Connor stated his summary of Magos' finding s, conce ding that the Magos study does not conclude \"that ethyl merc ury, in the same dose a s methy l mercur y, is more potent,\" but rather , \"that they [could] extract ... more ethyl merc ury using the revised method ... from the sample.\" Tr. 2 at 450. As Magos stands for the exact opposite of Dr. Connor's proposition, it is not overstate ment to find that Dr. Connor's stated opinion on this point, in his expert repor t and at the hearing, are incorre ct, and do not pe rsuade the Court on the issue(s) it addre sses. Later, Dr. Connor discussed another statement from his expert opinion that was based on his (faulty) under standing of the 1985 Mag os article: Q ...At the bottom of page 2 and onto page 3 you state, \"The recent data has indicated, depending on the age of the subject, ethyl merc ury at the same blood level appea rs more toxic than methy l merc ury.\" You don't provide any citations. Could you tell me what y ou wer e relying on? A Basically , I was relying on Magos, '85, the understanding that the amount of ethyl merc ury turned out to be highe r than the methyl mercury that some of the statemen ts from Lucier , who is a toxicolog ist, implies that ethyl merc ury, in his opinion, is m ore toxic than methy l mercur y. I'm relying on his statements. He's a toxicolog ist, not m e. Tr. 2 at 454. -58-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 58 of 177When challeng ed on another portion of his expert repor t, Dr. Connor could not point to \"any studies that show loss of respiratory function or pulmonary damag e as a result of exposure to thimerosal-c ontaining vacc ines,\" a nd appar ently was not sure whether such a study existed. Tr. 2 at 452. He concede d that the studies he cited in his expert repor t, regarding \"seve re pulmonary damag e,\" \"all dealt inhalation,\" i.e., inhalation of inorg anic, elementa l merc ury. Tr. 2 at 452. He agreed that those studies were \"not relevant\" to the issue at bar, and agreed that, to his knowledg e, Thomas Kolakowski had not been exposed to elementa l merc ury vapor. Tr. 2 at 453- 54. Dr. Connor's expert repor t had blurred the distinction betwee n organic and inorg anic merc ury, and when Respondent asked whether \"the [] ethyl merc ury compound or the inorg anic merc ury that led to Thomas Kolakowski's sudden death,\" Dr. Connor's only response was \"I wouldn 't know. That's a chemist's decision. That's call.\" Tr. 2 at 456. Unfortuna tely for Petitioners in this particular c ase, D r. Lucier offered no opinion on that question. Tr. 1 a t 146. Dr. Connor defended his understa nding that because \"ethy l merc ury is slower to cross the blood brain barrier,\" this makes \"ethy l merc ury more toxic than methy l merc ury,\" with the reasoning that \"[ethy l merc ury] crosse s that over a longe r period of time and at a highe r level.\" Tr. 2 at 455. He said this reasoning was supported by \"a study that was done with the rats which showed that basica lly at 12 hours methy l merc ury peaks out, at 24 hours ethyl merc ury peaks out and at 20 percent highe r,\" that he would forwa rd to Petitioners later on, but could not name at the time of the hearing. Id. Dr. Connor used the same explanation for his expert repor t's statement when Respondent asked what he was relying on for support of his statement that \"[apoptosis] and necrosis occur s simult aneously in ethyl merc ury exposures versus sequentially in methy l merc ury exposures\"-he could not provide the citation then, but would later. Tr. 2 at 456-57. He never did. To the Court's mind, this is unacc eptable. Dr. Connor had over two years betwee n the writing of his expert repor t and his hearing testimony to familiarize himself with the medical literature upon which he ( ostensibly ) base d his opinion. He knew, or should have been informed, that he would be held to account for the basis of his expert opinion at that hearing-inde ed, that was the primary reason for his appea rance that day. His lack of prepa ration made his testimony largely unhelpful to the Court, and did not allow Respondent to cross-e xamine the source of his opinions. All of this makes his opinion testi mony less persua sive. When Respondent presse d further on the subject of apoptosis, and asked what relation that79 proce ss had to do with \"thimerosal- containing vaccines causing sudden cardiac arrest,\" Dr. Connor stated that there was no re lation, beca use it is \"a chr onic condition.\" Tr. 2 a t 457. He ela borate d: Basically , apoptosis require s a stimul ation of the immune system to produce various leutokines. These basica lly can cause injury to cells which can result in early death, but this is not something that happens right away. This is something that occur s over a long er pe riod of time. Apoptosis (from the Greek for \"a falling off\") is \"a morphologic pattern of cell death affecting single cells,79 marked by shrinkage of the cell, condensation of chromatin, formation of cytoplasmic blebs, and fragmentation of the cell into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies that are eliminated by phagocytosis. it is a mechanism for cell deletion in the regulation of cell populations ... Often used synonymously with programmed cell death.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 117. -59-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 59 of 177Tr. 2 at 457.80 Dr. Conner stated that the basis for his conclusio n that \"ethy l merc ury appea rs more lipophili c than methy l merc ury\" is that \"since there can be highe r levels of the ethyl merc ury in the system and si nce both of the mercuries are lipophil ic by nature , that you are going to get a highe r level,\" but he admitted, \"Tha t's an extrapolation.\" Tr. 2 at 459. He did not mean that ethyl merc ury is more lipophili c by nature , just that \"[t]here is more there to be bound, there fore by just definition it's going to -- and it has a highe r peak level, the same volume of methy l is not necessarily going to give the same volume of merc ury as ethyl because, once again, methy l peaks earlier and plateaus off wher eas ethyl continues to plateau at 24 hours and is about 20 percent highe r.\" Tr. 2 at 460. Again, Dr. Connor's presupposition about the slower clearance of ethyl merc ury does not jibe with the He went on to elaborate further, which led to the following, rather odd conclusion:80 In the case of Thomas, the inflammation process begins with the first injection, continues on, but it doesn't necessarily mean that's the cause of this child's death. It means it's the cause that the immune system then is where you are getting the interstitial myocarditis going on that sets up the child for an abnormal cardiac response, but this information here is much more for a cell biologist and an immunologist to explain to others how it works. Q I'm not asking to explain how it works, but can you explain the relevance to thimerosal-containing vaccines causing sudden death? A The relevance is that the thimerosal, like methyl mercury, like other products in there, are capable of stimulating the immune system to produce the antibody -- I'm sorry -- the antigens which will provoke the inflammatory response. Q And what does apoptosis and necrosis have to do with that? A Because that's where you have early cell death, and that's part of the process that one will find in an inflammatory reaction. Q So the apoptosis and the necrosis are occurring as part of the inflammatory process? A Yes. Q That, in your opinion, was stimulated by the ethyl mercury? A Yes. Q If apoptosis and necrosis occurred sequentially as you say that happens in methyl mercury exposure, how does that affect the inflammatory process? A It is part of the inflammatory process. Q So whether it's sequential or simultaneous, it doesn't matter. A I don't understand what you mean by simultaneous. Q Well, you say apoptosis and necrosis occurs simultaneously in ethyl mercury versus sequentially in methyl mercury. A Yeah, and they could be the same. There are similarities. Q Whether it's sequential or simultaneous? A I don't believe so. Tr. 2 at 457-59. -60-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 60 of 177medical literature discussed in this regard, Burbache r in particula r. Moreove r, the point is moot because Dr. Connor refused to support his opinion, choosing instead to dismiss the issue as beyond his bailiwick: Q Assuming that ethyl merc ury is more lipophili c than methy l merc ury, how does the lipophilicity of ethy l mercur y make it more toxic than methy l mercur y? A I think I have to lea ve that to a toxicologist. Tr. 2 at 460-61 . Dr. Connor's defense of other statements in his expert repor t was simil arly unhelpful: Q You say that merc ury can also affect the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. What ty pe of me rcury are you talking a bout? A Can be methy l, can be ethy l. Q And at wha t dose? A I don't know. ... Q Can the amount of ethyl merc ury in a thimerosal-c ontaining vaccine affect the sympathetic and pa rasympathetic sy stems? A I would believe so but I am not really at this particula r point ready to cite any literature to that. Tr. 2 at 461- 62. During the next phase of Dr. Connor's cross-e xamination, Respondent challeng ed Dr. Connor's interpre tation of the mass poisoning studies. Respondent questioned Dr. Connor about his statements regarding the ethyl merc ury pesticide which coate d seed grain consumed by the subjects in the Dahha n study (EMPTS), and the c ardiolog ical aspe cts of the study : Q Is EMPTS t he same as thimerosal? A Ethyl mercur y is, acc ording to Dr. L ucier , the same r egardle ss. Q Regardle ss of what? A Because basica lly it's going to break down. The product is still going to break down to ethy l mercur y, and other side products. Q So for the purpose of this discussion, the ethy l mercur y, the EMPTS in t hat paper is the same as e thyl mercur y in vacc ines? A Yes. Q Does it have the same toxicokinetics? A And to that I 'm not a tox icolog ist. Q How we re the people se lected a s part of tha t study ? Do y ou know? A Good question. The a nswer is no, I don't. -61-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 61 of 177Q Weren't all of the people involved in that study already exhibi ting signs of merc ury toxicity? A Yes, ma' am, they were. Q So potentially that was one criter ia for pa rticipation in this? A I would assume so. Q Okay . Do you know what the dose of the EMPTS was that cause d the poisoning in that ca se? A No. Q Do y ou know how much they were exposed to? A Once again, no. Q Were ther e any clinical sig ns of ca rdiotox icity? A I don't believe that the -- the people themselves had some clinical signs here that were on Table 1, which talk about sore mouth, metallic tastes, blue lines, vomiting, diarrh ea, atio of how many of these sig ns per the 42. Q Were ther e clinica l signs of c ardiotoxi city? A The c ardiotox icity on a clinical was not descr ibed. icity on an EKG basis was de scribed. ... Q Is the exposure in this paper compar able to the doses of ethyl merc ury in thimerosal-c ontaining va ccine s? A I wouldn't know that. Q Is it scientifica lly valid to compar e the doses of EMPTS in this paper to ethyl merc ury in vacc ines? A I wouldn't know that. ... Q Will you ag ree that EMPTS i s differ ent from e thyl mercur y? A No. Tr. 2 at 463- 66. The next article discussed was the Cinca article , the details of which eluded Dr. Connor's recollection: Q Do you know the dose of ethyl merc ury chloride that cause d the poisoning in that case ? A I wouldn't know that. -62-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 62 of 177Q Do you know how long after exposu re to this contaminated meat that they showed fir st symptoms of mercury toxicity? A I wouldn't know that. Q Do y ou know wer e ther e any signs of cardiotox icity? A Appar ently the cardiotox icity was based on EKG. At this point I don't know that there were any clinical cardiotox ic signs since the majority of the problem appea red to be neurolog ic. Q Are there any repor ts of sudden dea th as a re sult of this ex posure? A Sudden death.... There was repor ts of cardiac arrest in at least two of the cases. Q Doctor, in this paper it indica tes that the patients who were studied, it was a mother and three children referred to the clinic by a hospital wher e they had already treated for 17 da ys. A I believe tha t was stated, y es. Q Okay. So it had been at least 17 days, you would agree, from the time of exposure to the time that these people prese nt to the hospital? A They were prese nting as a neurolog ic problem. I have no idea how long the cardiac pr oblem was g oing on. Q Do you know the merc ury blood levels in the people who were studied in this paper ? A I don't. Tr. 2 at 467- 68. Comparing the Cinca paper to the case at bar, Dr. Connor could not rende r an opinion compar ing the blood levels in the Cinca paper 's subjects with those contained in a thimerosal- containing vaccine, but agreed that among the fatal cases repor ted by Cinca, \"ther e was evidenc e of demy elination of the cranial nerve s and myocarditis.\" Tr. 2 at 469. When asked if pattern was repeated in Thomas Kolakowski 's autops y data, Dr. Connor pointed to the brain, heart, and liver enlar gement discussed in Thomas Kolakowski's autopsy repor t. Id. To Dr. Connor, this implied that death wa s vacc ine-re lated, in the abse nce of other known f actor s: [T]here was a significant a bnormality that was developing in this child, and clearly out of the examination that was done they basica lly looked at the whole body , found nothing to explain any type of disease proce ss. There was no cong enital abnorma lities. There was a study done on the genetics chromosomes, and that was81 basica lly, I believe, negative. They did gross specimen or gross anatomy of the case and found nothing particula rly abnorma l in the child. There was no cong enital No records of genetic analysis performed on Thomas' DNA were filed.81 -63-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 63 of 177diseases that they could deal with. So what they were left with are organ enlar gement, brain, heart, liver, in which was basica lly a normal birth, normal Apgar, normal child. They even broug ht in people, forensic patholog ists in. They couldn't find anything wrong . The only thing that they could find at that time that broug ht up a question was the injection to Hep. B vaccines within about 32 days, 33 days of each other, a nd thought that ne eded f urther e valuation, furthe r consider ation. Tr. 2 at 469-70. Howeve r, Dr. Connor did not know, and could not opine , whether \"ther e was any finding of interstitial myocarditis in Thomas Kolakowski,\" and he deferred to the patholog ists on that point. Tr. 2 at 470. When a sked if heart enlarg ement was the same, or differ ent than my ocarditis, Dr. Connor again noted that he would \"have to defer to the patholog ists.\" Tr. 2 at 470-71. In contra st to his far-ranging opinion given in his expert repor t, Dr. Connor's retice nce on this last point seeme d singula r, since the differ ences distinguishing he art enlarg ement obser ved postmortem and myocarditis would seem a cardiologist could explain. Lastly, Respondent's cross-e xamination of Dr. Connor focuse d on the specific facts and circumstances of Thomas Kolakowski's course . In a nutshell, Dr. Connor seeme d ready to offer an opinion on \"did even without proff ering the \"c an it\" question: Q Can you tell me what happens when thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines are injected into the body ? A ...Basically , vaccines are basica lly injected into the body with the Hepatitis or with the antig en. It is basica lly bound to the aluminum hydroxi de. Thimerosal basica lly is an agent that is supposed to be as a prese rvative, but it has the ability of acting as an a ctivator to help distribute the va ccine into the tissues. Q Thimerosal he lps to dist ribute the va ccine into the tissue? A It is supposed to act as a c ataly st. Q What happens whe n thimerosal enter s the body ? A I think you have to talk to an immunologist. You're getting beyond my scope. I 'm a c ardiolog ist. Tr. 2 at 472- 73. Dr. Connor was less cautious about rende ring an opinion outside of his expertise when concluding that the vac cination was to blame for the de ath of Thomas K olakowski: When you start t o discuss abnorma l startle re sponses, y ou're then pos sibly dealing with either a periphe ral injury to the nervous system , to the nerve s or to the extremiti es, or you're deali ng with a centr al problem, which would be more in the brain, bra in ste m. At that point that would be a sec ond war ning f lag. The fa ct that the child died in 108 hours of the second vaccination, it was already too late to do anything because the warning signs were not recognized, and I would say those would be the thing I looked at and said, this is wher e I believe this c hild is differ ent than other children. You can still have children that die, even if they've had vaccinations, but these are a couple of the signs or subtle signs that I have to look at -64-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 64 of 177with suspicion to explain why this c hild would be differ ent from another child who might get a vaccination. This c hild is differ ent bec ause basica lly what should ha ve gone away didn't. Now I'm trying to fig ure out wa s there any place along the way that things chang ed to make this child different than another child, and thos e were the par ts that -- those we re the particula r two items that caug ht my attention. Tr. 2 at 475. In fact, Dr. Connor believed his discus sion of the tremors was corre ct, even when it was incong ruent with the opinion of Petitioners' retained (but non-testify ing) pediatric neurolog ist: Q [Y]ou're relying on the mother's affidavit for the evidenc e of any tremors in this child. A Well, I have to rely on the mother's affidavit because she is basica lly a person who is involved with the care of the child on a day-to-day basis. I have to rely on the fact that many of these particula r phone calls were made around Christmas and New Years, and sever al of the calls were made on Saturda ys, that the pediatric ians themselves would have not been in their office . There was no way they would have put the notes into the chart. What I found in addition to that is there is a grandmother or a mother-in-la w who is also an interested party who says that she basically had seen something that didn't look r ight to he r, and the mother followed up on it. The fact that I don't see the information in a chart, I would have preferr ed to, but I thought the note s were very limit ed. ... Q Okay . And then I tried to keep track as you were testify ing, it seeme d to me there were at least four times in which you noted the mother approa ched the doctor or ca lled the doctor a bout what she c onsidered to be tremors. A Correc t. Q Yet did it strike you at all that none of that inform ation made it into the medical r ecords? A Not when it was done on a Saturday night in one case, and on New Year's Eve on a nother c ase, no. Q What about an offic e visit? A I don't know. I can' t expl ain that. ... Q Doctor, is it your opinion that the tremors that you're relying on in the mother's a ffidavit ar e a sig n of merc ury toxicity? A I'm saying that it is unusual to have tremors after a few weeks. Now I'm looking back 10 years later as Monday morning quarte rback, and say ing they have the likelihood that it could have bee n merc ury toxicity or thimerosal toxi city. -65-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 65 of 177Q If you relied on the medical records alone, without the mother's affidavit, is there any evidenc e that there was unusual signs that you say could have been symptoms of thim erosa l toxicity? A Yes, the a utopsy is going to have to be w here I have to g o. Q So the medical records don't provide it in terms of his pediatric care records? A No. Q Doctor, you would agree that you are not qualified to diagnose merc ury toxicity based on the descr iption in t he mother' s affidavit? A No. ... Q Petitioners asked Dr. Kinsbourne to revie w this case, particula rly with an eye toward try ing to f urther e lucidate wha t mother was talking a bout in her af fidavit of tremors.... So a pediatric neurolog ist looked at the record. He looked at the affidavit. He presumably had all the medical records in the case, and he couldn't arrive at a conclusion wha t those movements that mom described w ere. A But he's, once again, looking at it from a neurolog ist's point of view without looking a t the autopsy and the pa thologist's point of view. Tr. 2 at 475- 79. Dr. Connor stated that he did not see any evidenc e of cardiotox icity in any of Thomas Kolakowski's records. Tr. 2 at 480. But to him, that would not preclude an conclusion of cardiotox icity in Thomas: What we have to rely on is what possibly could happe n to explain the enlarg ement of the hea rt, and the possibility that this child had an event where by there could be a setup for a signific ant cardiac arrhythmia that could come into this child and cause a cardiac arrest. Tr. 2 at 480. Dr. Connor stipulated that this was the first case in which he had \"attributed sudden cardiac arrest to merc ury toxicity,\" and that he had never \"diag nosed anyone with cardiotox icity as a result of exposure to merc ury.\" Tr. 2 at 480-81. Dr. Connor could not say what would be \"the amount of ethyl merc ury exposure require d to cause merc ury toxicity to the heart,\" because \"that would be in the re alm of the toxi colog ist.\" Tr. 2 at 481. Continui ng on in discussing the specific facts of Thomas Kolakowski, Dr. Connor was questioned on hi s opinion reg arding the lividity noted i n the m edica l records. To Dr. Connor, the other symptoms noted (asystole, apnea ) would fit a classic cardiac arrest paradigm, \"but the lividit y would be a little more of an issue.\" Tr. 2 at 481. He descr ibed lividit y as \"blood pooling in a very particula r area falling to gravity ,\" and agreed that its prese nce indicates that \"blood is not circulating normally in the body ,\" which is cause d by \"[d]eath, but over a period of time.\" Tr. 2 at 481-82. He -66-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 66 of 177clarified hi s opinion, stated on direc t examination, saying that, at the time of the EMTs' arrival,82 Thomas was in cardiac arrest, but was not already dead, althoug h he could not say with any particula rity when Thoma s actua lly died. Tr. 2 a t 482-83. Commenting on the EKG strips and EMT notes, contained within the EMT records, Dr. Connor summarized that, \"The y called it asystolic. It could have been a fibrillation.\" Tr. 2 at 484. Also, according to Dr. Connor, when further EKG readings were taken, \"it looked like there was some rhythm activity ... it was chaotic and it was still an abnorma l heartbeat ... [it c]ould have been a slower form of ventricula r tachy cardia.\" Tr. 2 at 485. Dr. Connor agreed that the observa tion of Thomas by the EMTs at 7:32 that morning was that \"he had no pulse and no respira tions,\" and that they recorded his EKG as \"asystolic.\" Tr. 2 at 485-86. Likewise, he agreed that their additional EKG notes record Thomas as being asystolic at 7:40, 7:43, and 7:46 as well. Tr. 2 at 486. Dr. Connor did not see in the medical records any indication that medical personne l tried to shock Thomas' heart, because \"[y]ou need to have a course fibrillation in order to make a shock effective, and there wasn't enoug h here to show a course fibrillation.\" Tr. 2 at 487. Dr. Connor thought Thomas' heart rate of 21 could be \"consistent with an agonal rhythm,\" because \"you can still have electrical a ctivity without actually having functional a ctivity .\" Tr. 2 a t 489. Respondent asked Dr. Connor to label the identifiable wave segments in Thomas' EKG strips as taken by the EMTs and at the hospital. Tr. 2 at 490-92. Intere stingly , though, after ve, Dr . Connor added: But once again, it has no value. It has no value whatsoeve r.... Because we're dealing with a dying heart. It does not tell me anything about what happene d that set the thing in motion. I have no information there . Agonal rhythms ba sically are agonal rhythms. Every body will have a prolong ed QT in that, even if it was from a heart attack. It does not necessarily tell me anything about a setup for a dysrhythmia. I can't extrapolate backw ards, and if you're expecting me to, that would be an error. I'm just making a comment that you have an agonal rhythm. It's slow, and basica lly what I can see there is small complexes, prolong ed QT, but it does not tell me anything a bout the prec eding event.... ...[Regarding an earlier statement,] I made a n observa tion. I 'm not stating that that was the cause of it because it being agonal rhy thm I wouldn't state i t was a cause . If it was, it was unintende d. Q So your observa tion that on arrival his EK G showed an agonal rhythm with a heart rate at 21, very small QRS complex, prolong ed QT interval and inverted T-wa ves has nothing to do with the cause of -- A Not for the precipitating event. This is after the event is over with, beca use that would get me into a problem of saying that that would be a valid reason for saying that that was the cause of it. I'm looking at the after effect. I'm not necessarily looking a t what set it off. I have no doc umentation of that. \"[T]he child may have died just shortly before mother awoke, or may have had a cardiac arrest shortly before82 mother awoke.\" Tr. 2 at 367. -67-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 67 of 177Tr. 2 at 492- 93. Dr. Connor's dismissal of the EKG strips from the morning of Thomas' de ath extended to any compar ison with the EKGs measur ed in the Da hhan ar ticle: Q Is it reasonable to compar e the EKGs in the Dahha n article to the EKGs in Thomas Kolakowski? A There were no EKG s in Thomas Kolakowski. Q Based on our earlier discussion, Doctor, you would not take these EKGs that we have on Thomas Kolakowski and say that any of them demonstrate a prolong ed QT interva l? A Of any value? Q Of any value. A No. This is a dying heart. Even if it's prolong ed, it doesn't prove anything. It cannot be a pplied. Q So the authors of the Dahha n article state that everyone who died had prolong ed QT inter vals, we c an't re late that in any way to Thomas Kolakowski? A They were in a pre-arrest -- they were taken at a pre-arrest state. In the post-arr est state wher e you're dealing with residual electrical activity from the cardiac muscle wher e you may have e lectric al/ mecha nical dissociation. Tr. 2 at 495- 96.83 this same point, Dr. Connor explained in further detail:83 In the case where you have a heartbeat which is registered on the electrocardiogram, you have to have two items. One is the electrical activity where you have the PQRST seen, as you do in this end stage heart here, but you then must have the muscle functioning in such a way as to contract and push the blood from the right heart to the lungs, from the left heart to the aorta. So you have both electrical and mechanical action. Once the child, the person has died or has been declared dead it's because they can no longer determine that there is any mechanical action on the periphery from this person, yet the heart muscle will give you the impression that electrical activity still exists, but we now have electrical/mechanical dissociation, which is what you see in a dead heart, and this is what you're looking at here in the agonal rhythm. You're looking at the dying heart with electrical activity in the muscle parts that are still alive, but they are not capable of producing a mechanical effect of moving the blood from the right heart to the lungs, from the left heart out. This person has passed the point of no return. So you really are looking at electrical/mechanical dissociation right here, and the fact that you still see some electrical activity doesn't mean that the person is alive nor does it mean that the person can be brought back, but that the person died within a certain timeframe, and you asked me that before, and I can't give that to you, but by the same token this is not a person that's been dead for several hours. That's why I have a little problem with the lividity on the statement. I don't know that electrical/mechanical dissociation could go on to the point where lividity would have been seen. I know pathologists can answer that better than me, but generally speaking I don't know what they saw or what they were interpreting. -68-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 68 of 177Lastly, Respondent questioned Dr. Connor regarding the potential for alterna tive cause s of death. Tr. 2 at 498-99. Dr. Connor did not believe that a prolonged QT interval was \"a specific finding \" for merc ury toxicity. Tr. 2 at 498. He was unsure whether a prolong ed QT interval was a typical finding i n asphyxiation cases, because he does not work with asphy xiation, and sugg ested that the patholog ists in this case would be better suited to opine in that regard. Tr. 2 at 498. He did say that all other potential cause s of death, besides the Hepa titis B vacc ine, had been ruled out, in his mind, and that the onl y possible cause , or \"trigg ering event\" leading l-containing Hepa titis B va ccina tions. Tr. 2 at 498. 3. John J . Shane, M.D. Dr. Shane went to Lehigh University and Hahne man University College of Medicine befor e engaging in a rotating internship at Wilkes Barre General Hospital, followed by a four- year residenc y in Clinical and Anatomical Pathology at Hahne man in Philadelphia, during which, he studied forensic patholog y in Philadelp hia's Procee dings convene d on 11 June 2008 (Tr. 3) at 588. There after, he practiced at St. Agnes Hospital as Chief of Pathology and Direc tor of Labora tory Medicine (\"responsible for the entire clinical labora tory and the entire Depa rtment of Anatomic Pathology \") and taught at Hahne man for eight years. Tr. 3 at 59. Eventually , in 1974, Dr. Shane became Chairman of Lehigh Valley Hospital's Depa rtment of Pathology , which became \"the larg est acute care hospi tal in the state o f Pennsylvania,\" a pos ition he held for the following 28 years. Tr. 3 at 589. There at, the patholog ists specia lized their practice based upon to specia lize in neuropa thology and cardiovascular patholog y. Tr. 3 at 590. He continued to teach at various universities, and oversa w a fellowship at his hospital, until the year 2000. Tr. 3 at 590-91. At that time, he also went into his own private practice, wher e he rema ins, performing 60 to 80 autopsies per year, as well as consulting on forensic patholog y issues with other pathologists. Tr. 3 at 591-92. His practice has never limit ed to any84 particula r age bracket, and he has performed autopsies on children and adults of all ages. Tr. 3 at 592. Dr. Shane's direc t examination turned to focus more particula rly on his experience over the years with the issues prese nted by the case(s) at bar. Regarding whether Dr. Shane's teaching experience involved discussing merc ury toxicity, Dr. Shane said that it formed part of his discussion on liver disease as a toxic threa t to the liver. Tr. 3 at 595. Regarding whether he had ever Tr. 2 at 496-97. Dr. Shane explained this aspect of his practice thusly:84 Forensic pathology has to do with abnormal death. Death due to any unnatural cause. Many of these cases, the bulk of the cases that we did were impact, they were motor vehicular. And there were all ages that came through because all ages of people die in motor vehicular accidents. We also did the standard run of suicides, homicides, and asphyxial death is a coroner's case, as this case, actually died in one of the Pinnacle hospitals but was referred to the local coroner because it was an unexplained death. Unexplained deaths come to the coroners. This case fell into the unexplained category so it was sent to the forensic people. Tr. 3 at 593-94. -69-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 69 of 177encounte red a case of merc ury toxicity as a patholog ist, Dr. Shane regaled that he could recall two, the most recent of which was a slow, steady poisoning by a wife of her husband with merc uric salts (inorg anic merc ury). Tr. 3 at 597. Dr. Shane expressed that he was familiar with the effects of merc ury exposure on the ner vous and ca rdiovascula r systems. Id. Moving on to the facts of this particula r case, Dr. Shane focuse d, much as Dr. Connor had, on the relative good health of Thomas from his full-term birth until his death, and Mrs. Kolakowski's reference to \"tremors\" in her affidavit. Tr. 3 at 598. He descr ibed symptoms demonstrated by Thomas following his second Hepa titis B vaccination, such as \"GI gas, decreased appetite, some respira tory difficulties, and a skin rash.\" Id. Dr. Shane referred to Thomas' EKG activity as \"pulseless electrical activity \" in that \"he didn't have a pulse, but he had cardiac electrical activity .\" Tr. 3 at 599. Dr. S hane found it \"very important\" that Thomas was \"warm to the touch when the EMTs arrived ... because babies, particula rly in December going outdoors, even in a 70 degree room, babies have such a surfa ce area that they lose heat very rapidly .\" Id. The recorded body tempera ture of 97\u00b0F meant, to Dr. Shane, that this was \"a very recent death from the time he was examined.\" Id. Later during his direc t examination, Dr. Shane was asked whether the descr iption in the EMT records of \"cardiac arrest\" was consistent with his analy sis, and he explained that this was only partially correct: If we're to take cardiac arrest as pulseless, this child was pulseless. If we're to take cardiac arrest as there is no myocardial activity , no. This child had myocardial activity . This child had electrical activity on the EKGs from the EMT. Certainly had electrical a ctivity on the EKGs in the e merg ency facility. Tr. 3 at 627- 28. Dr. Shane next broug ht his patholog y experience to bear on the patholog y slides made pursuant to Thomas' autopsy . Tr. 3 at 600. Dr. Shane related that in his first examination of those slides, his attention was draw n wholly to the encephalic data, but tha t his second look a t the slides focuse d on the \"very subtle\" chang es he observe d in the cardiac slides. Tr. 3 at 601. He conclude d that both systems manifested adver se effects \"dire ctly related to the merc ury exposure.\" Id. Dr. Shane heape d praise on the thoroug hness of the examining patholog ist and the slide prepa ration performed by the appurte nant labora tory. Tr. 3 at 602. The first finding to which Dr. Shane direc ted his focus wa s gliosis, foll owed by \"dropout\" of the g ranula r cells of the cer ebellum: -70-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 70 of 177I saw the gliosis. The gliosis spanned the glial cell population which include85 astrocy tes, microg lia and oligodendrog lia. When I use the term gliosis I mean86 prolifer ation as well as activation. A dormant glial ell has a particula r appea rance micros copica lly when it become s reactive and it's now doi ng what it 's intended to do. It gets a differe nt appea rance -- there is some enlar gement of the cell, there are some nuclea r chang es, and I use the ter m \"turned on\" is the term I use with f ellows and residents that I teach. This is a \"turne d on\" glial cell which means it's a reactive glial cell. So we had both. We had the prolifer ation, we had the change in appea rance of the glial cells. The cerebellar finding s were interesting in that we had drop-out of the granula r cells. The granula r cells occupy a very narrow area in the cerebellum. So if you have enoug h drop-out it can actua lly appea r that there 's a separ ation occur ring there . It was my interpre tation that this separ ation was due to the granula r cell drop-out. There was a decrease in the num ber of granula r cells, and there were also Purkinje cell chang es. The Purkinje cell chang es were, again, changes of degeneration. 87 These w ere the finding s that I repor ted in addition to the cer ebral edema. This had som e perivascular , perig lial, perine uronal c lear space s. These clear space s were more prominent than one woul d see with normal tissue shrinkag e. I refer to them as halos. There were halos around these scular, perig lial, perine uronal that d with edema . In Dr. Shane contextualized gliosis by introducing the nature of the glial cells:85 Glial cells are the inflammatory reactive cells of the brain. Yes, you can get migration of other inflammatory cells from the peripheral blood into the brain, but locally in the brain the brain has its own population of inflammatory reactive components. The astroglia, they respond quickly to a local process. And if you're to make an analogy, the analogy would be to the neutrophils which are the acute phase reactants elsewhere. The more chronic reactants, sub-acute chronic reactants, is the microglia. They're like the lymphocytes and they come in a little bit later with their changes. I view the oligodendroglia as the fibroblasts of the brain. They come in and they can make scar tissue in an area of injury. They're a more chronic reactant. I use the analogy in my teaching to a fibroblast. All three types of glial cells in this case were reactive, they were turned on, and they were proliferated. There was an increased number of them. Tr. 3 at 604. Oligodendroglia are \"the non-neural cells of ectodermal origin forming part of the adventitial structure86 (neuroglia) of the central nervous system; projections of the surface membrane of each of these cells (oligodendrocytes) fan out and coil around the axon of many neurons to form myelin sheaths in the white matter. With microglia, they form the perineuronal satellites in the gray matter.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 1305. Purkinje cells come large neurons in the cerebellar cortex that have piriform cell bodies in87 th Purkinje layer ... and large branching dendrite trees going through the outer (molecular) layer towards the surface. 2. cells of the Purkinje fibers of the heart; they are large, clear, tightly packed cells with many gap junctions between them and thus conduct impulses rapidly.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 325. -71-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 71 of 177a few sec tions there wa s a little bit of a extravasation of erythrocy tes. That's a lso88 part of the cerebral edema pr ocess. Tr. 3 at 602- 03. When Dr. Shane stated that he observe d edema in the brain, the Court interjec ted to ask whether he viewed that edema as vasog enic or cytotox ic, to which he replied: \"The re was some89 90 of each. There was some vasog enic edema and there was some cytotox ic edema, so it was one of those place s wher e we had an overla p of edema .\" Tr. 3 at 605. Dr. Shane stated the signific ance of this conclusion: The significanc e is that this is a proce ss wher e there is within the brain cytoinflammation. A cytoinflammatory proce ss that is making these cells reactive. And as part of that reacti vity there are chang es in the blood vessel perme ability , allowing fluid to escape into the periva scular and perig lial space s. And in addition, as part of that cytoinflammatory proce ss, we have what's called spong iosis or some91 intervening edema within the cer ebral white matter. Tr. 3 at 605- 06. Dr. Shane stated that, much like the presence of white blood cells in the bloodstream, the prese nce of glial cells indicates an inflammatory response in the brain. Tr. 3 at 606. He went on to say, though, that this response of gliosis is non-spec ific, which means it does not implicate a specific stimul us as ca usative: [T]he bra in kind of is a unique org an bec ause it re acts to a whole number of things by doing the same thing. You get cerebral edema , albeit of differ ing types with toxic involvement, you get it with injury , you get it with hypoxia, you get it with tumors,92 you get it with infarc ts or strokes. The brain gets edema tous almo st with any stimul us. So you have this broad spectrum of things that cause s cerebral edema . An erythrocyte is \"one of the elements found in peripheral blood ... a non-nucleated, yellowish, biconcave88 disk, adapted by virtue of its configuration and its hemoglobin content to the transport of oxygen.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 640. Vasogenic edema is \"a type of cerebral edema seen in the area around tumors, largely confined to the white89 matter; it often results from increased permeability of capillary endothelial cells and less often is due to toxic injury to the vessels.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 590. Cytotoxic edema is \"cerebral edema caused by hypoxic injury to brain tissue and decreased functioning of90 the sodium pump, so that the cellular elements take in fluid and swell.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 589. Spongiosis is \"intercellular DORLAND'S, supra,91 at 589. Hypoxia is the \"reduction of oxygen supply to tissue below physiological levels despite adequate perfusion92 of the tissue by blood.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 890. -72-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 72 of 177When w e deal with ne uroly sis, it happens under many , many conditions. There 's93 a lot of overla p. When you see something in the brain and you ask yourself the question what cause d this, ther e's alway s some degree of overla p with what cause d it. It's when you put together the complex of finding s that you begin to narrow down the cause s and you can develop some timing. So you have finding s that are overlapping, but the more finding s you put in there , the more specific you can become about what cause d it, so it's a matter of looking at the finding s collectively rathe r than individually , number one. And the more individual finding s that you have the more spe cific y ou can be come a bout interpreting the ca usation. Tr. 3 at 606- 07. I n the instant case , Dr. Shane said he viewed the conjunction of both \"turned on\" oligodendroglia and fibroblasts meant that very recent,\"94 adding , \"Olig odendrog lia don't get turned on immediately , they get turned on a little bit later.\" Tr. 3 at 607. Moving on to the more \"subtle\" cardiovascular finding s he made from the tissue slides, Dr. Shane stated: Those findings i n the heart were, num ber one, diffused interstitial edema in all the sections, and in particula r in the sections of the septum, the interventric ular septum. I had an inflammatory cell infiltrate, and it was a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate. There was some acute , some sub-ac ute, some chronic elements. Not a big time infiltrate, but it was there . There were inflammatory cells, albeit you had to look for them. But whe n you looked for the m, they were ther e.... And in the septum, the septum is unique because it is going to be very, very susceptible, as it is in adults, to vascula r chang es. And that's wher e I saw some early myocardial muscle cell shrinkag e. Again, a subtle findi ng, but on study ing the sections of heart I am convince d that there was myocardial cell shrinkag e and some earlier myocardial cell degeneration occur ring in that septum. I had to be persua ded of those finding s befor e I would call them. I was persua ded, I did call them as such. It ties in with the finding s of cong estive heart failure in this child, and those95 finding s were the liver cong estion, the spleen cong estion , and of course the pulmonary cong estion which wa s very , very marke d. Tr. 3 at 611. When asked what the signi ficance was of \"early myocardial cell shrinkag . Shane ela borate d: Neurolysis is \"1. release of a nerve sheath by cutting it longitudinally; 2. the operative breaking up of93 perineural adhesions; 3. the relief of tension upon a nerve obtained by stretching; 4. destruction or dissolution of nerve tissue.\" DORLAND'S, 1255-56. a flat elongated cell with cytoplasmic processes at each end, having94 a flat, oval, vesicular nucleus. Fibroblasts ... form tissues of the DORLAND'S, supra, at 695. Congestive heart failure is \"a clinical syndrome due to heart disease, characterized by breathlessness and95 abnormal sodium and water retention, often resulting in edema. The congestion may occur in the lungs or peripheral circulation or both, depending on whether the heart failure is right-sided or general.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 672. -73-Case Page 73 of 177The signif icanc e of that is that the blood supply to that septum is the anterior desce nding branc h of the left corona ry artery, and there really isn't a lot of overla p. That's it for blood supply . That's why anter ior desce nding occlusions in older people are called widow maker s. Don' t have a lot of overla p in blood supply . With the edema that was developing , that edema would reduc e the amount of blood supply to the cellular components of that septum, and that resulted in the early, again, early, beginning, subtle c hang es in those my ocardial muscle ce lls. Tr. 3 at 612-13. He added that his assessment of diffuse interstitial edema is \"a type of edema that you see in a n interstitial my ocarditis.\" Tr. 3 at 613. Continui ng on, he went into further de tail on his notation of \"interve ntricular c hang es\" to the c ardia c septum: Interventricular septal chang es which are signific ant because those chang es will produce arrhythmias. The interventric ular septum houses what's called the Purkinje system. The heart has its own nervous system. It's called the Purkinje system. Purkinje fibers are modified myocardial muscle cells that are modified to conduct neurolog ical signa ls. The SA node, the AV node communicates via the Purkinje system. The Purkinje system, the conduction system of the heart is housed exclusively in the interventric ular septum. All i mpulses emana te out over the wall of the left and right ventricle s from that Purkinje system and the septum, so I felt those subtle chang es would be ve ry consistent with disarrhy thmias. Tr. 3 at 613-14. When asked if these chang es might affect the heart's conduction system, Dr. Shane responde d: Yes, that is the conduc tion system. It is housed ex clusively in the IV septum. It's single vessel blood supply is going to certainly have, even small amounts of edema are going to begin to impact on those vessels emana ting from that LAD and cause these muscle f iber c hang es. Tr. 3 at 614. Dr. Shane believed that his analy sis of the patholog ical finding s dovetailed with the clinical record: This c hild in that hiatus time betwee n rec eiving the second injection and dying and the autopsy did have respira tory involvement. There were respiratory symptoms. This c hild did have loss of appetite. L oss of appe tite is the preeminent f inding[] in liver congestion. Patients with cong estive heart failure , what do they complain of when they come in? Doctor, I have no appetit e. It's because of that cong estion of the liver. So this child had decreased appetite. This child had the respira tory finding s befor e death. Now we have this prominent cong estion. In addition, this child was complaining of gas, and I'm pretty sure the gas would correlate to this child having some viscera l passive cong estion as well. So there were symptoms that tied in with these finding s in these organs that are part of the medical record that are explained by the patholog y finding s and they correlate with the patholog y finding s. Tr. 3 at 612. -74-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 74 of 177Dr. Shane also made much of the rathe r nonspecific weig hts. And the incre ase organ weig hts involved the brain, very prominently . The brain weig ht was increased, the liver was incre ased, the spleen was incre ased, the kidney s were incre ased somewhat. A heart had an inc reased we ight.... I think the slight incre ase in weig ht of the heart was due to the edema , but the heart is small, hence the amount of edema fluid is going to be a matter of a few grams, that's all. The brain is much bigger. The capacity of the edema fluid or to accommodate edema fluid is much greater. So they're going to have this very drama tic incre ase of about 100 grams. The kidney s, again, can have some incre ased weig ht due to cong estion, due to edema. And there we have a very signific ant 20 percent incre ase about in the weig ht of the kidney s. The spleen was incre ased very substantially . The liver was incre weig ht. This is due chang es.... The c ombined weig ht of the lung s was 180 g rams. Nor mal is 68 grams. So this is very, very drama tic. The only thing that gives you that kind of weig ht incre ase is pulmonary edema . There was seve re congestion here, some escaped fluid is going to be obvious. That fluid, again, might be extracted during the proce ssing, but nonetheless it was there because that kind of weig ht incre ase is cong estion and passive cong estive cha nges that I descr ibed. Tr. 3 at 615-16. The Court quer ied Dr. Shane on whether the incre ased organ weig hts w as cause d by whateve r also cause d Thomas' death, or if it was just \"part and parcel to the agonal proce ss,\" to which Dr . Shane re sponded the diff erence w as one of mag nitude and deg ree: That is far more than you could possibly accumulate in the short timeframe of the agonal proce ss. You're not going to get that much in that short a time. The cerebral edema , there 's no way with the agonal proce ss that you are going to collect 100 grams of edema fluid in this baby brain during the agonal proce ss. So this was something tha t was g oing on be fore the ag onal proc ess. Tr. 3 at 616- 17. Dr. Shane agreed with the statem ent made by Petitioners, that pulmonary edema is \"also known as cong estive heart failure ,\" a patently false proposition, and in an attempt to elabor ate, said,96 \"if you're not putting that blood out of the left ventricle you can't put the blood in from the lungs and Pulmonary edema is \"abnormal, diffuse, extravascular accumulation of fluid in the pulmonary tissues and96 air spaces due to changes in hydrostatic forces in the capillaries or to increased capillary permeability; it is characterized clinically by intense dyspnea and, in the intra-alveolar form, by voluminous expectoration of frothy pink serous fluid and, if severe, by cyanosis.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 589. Congestive heart failure is \"a clinical syndrome due to heart disease, characterized by breathlessness and abnormal sodium and water retention, often resulting in edema. The congestion may occur in the lungs or peripheral circulation or both, depending on whether the heart failure is right-sided or general.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 672. The two share attributes, and one may be a (nonspecific) symptom of the other, but to say that they are equivalent is quite incorrect. -75-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 75 of 177they cong est.\" Tr. 3 at 617. Also, Dr. Shane believed, unsurprising ly, that the edema in the myocardium was related to the edema in the lungs, liver, spleen, kidney s, and viscera , all \"part and parcel of rig ht and left he art fa ilure.\" Id. When asked if Thomas' death was \"quick\" or \"drawn out,\" Dr. Shane replied, \"drawn out,\" but then proceede d to cite as his evidenc e for this answe r nothing about his analy sis of the agona l proce ss at all, and to focus entirely on clinical features that (ostensibly ) preceded the night of Thomas' death by days and weeks. Tr. 3 at 619-20. In doing so, Dr. Shane displayed the profe ssional, analy tical and e xplanatory skill of a medieval ba rber.97 The next point addre ssed by Dr. Shane was that infants' brains are qualitatively differ ent from adults' brains in some ways, and in some ways they are simil ar. He explained that the br ain continues to mature and develop after birth in fundame ntal ways, and that, for a time, the blood-brain barrier is more porous and less restric tive. Tr. 3 at 618-19. In fact, he noted that, with infants, \"everything goes throug h,\" as they receive nutrients and antibodies from their mother while in utero . Id. He noted tha t the barr ier prog ressively closes as the child g rows older . Tr. 3 at 619. The nex t major phase of Dr . Shane's testim ony considere d some of the medical literature filed in this case. Specifica lly, Dr. Shane stated that \"ther e is only one article that is very, very good on the histopathologic finding s, what we see under the microscope ,\" and that was the Cinca article ;98 due to Dr. Shane's area of profe ssional expertise, he focuse d on it. Tr. 3 at 621. He saw it as relevant to this case in the first part, because it \"talks about neurona l necrosis,\" and Dr. Shane saw neurona l necrosis in vie wing Thomas Kolakowski's a utopsy slides, including \"nerve cells that are showing nuclea r fragmentation and deg eneration\" and \" cytoplasmic chang es.\" Tr. 3 at 622. This was sig nificant to Dr. Shane \"bec ause ne uronal de generation takes time to deve lop [and does not] happen instantly in a ver y sudden dea th.\" Tr. 3 a t 622. He continued: We have the [ gliosis] that they talk about. I talked about the g lobal [gliosis] . That is a finding that they relied upon. In that article they talk specific ally about the cerebellar chang es, the granula r cellular drop-out, which we have. We have the granula r cell degenerative chang es. And the Purkinje cell chang es, which we also had in this case. So when we look at the cerebellar finding s, which are unique to the Specifically, he said:97 If we take this child had respiratory difficulties, if we take into consideration that this child had decreased appetite, the decreased appetite I tie into the liver. The respiratory changes I tie into some congestion of those lungs. The feeling that this child had a lot of gas, I tie that into gastrointestinal congestion. So this child was symptomatic over a period of time and just happened to die very very sub-recently to going into the emergency room. This death occurred very very close to that child being found unresponsive and that's based on the factual things. The fact that this child had some PEA, pulseless electrical activity, still remaining in that heart during transit, still remaining when the child arrived to the hospital. And this child even in a hospital was 97 degrees, the child was warm. Tr. 3 at 619-20. Pet. Ex. 18, Tab V, I.

The cerebellar99 finding s are the g ranula r cell drop-out, the Purkinje ce ll chang es, and w e had tha t. The critica l findings are the ede ma, the g liosis, t he neurona l drop-out, and we have that. Again, these are chang es that individually can occur in a number of situations. The cortical changes, three cortica l chang es of neurona l necrosis, the edema , the gliosis, that could occur in a host of differ ent conditions so long as you take into considera tion the time involved for this to occur . But then when we put into the mix the cerebellar finding s, the cerebellar finding s begin to narrow massively the choice s and the best choice of a causa tive factor would be the merc ury, we have the merc ury exposure with the thimerosal. The me rcury chang es are desc ribed in this literature article . We have them here. It's a fit. So overw helmingly , more probably than not, I believe the centr al ner vous sy stem chang es we re the result of mer cury toxicity. Tr. 3 at 622-23. Dr. Shane has testified befor e this Court enoug h times to know that generalized reference to conclusory opinion, without explanatory detail of what and how, rema in unpersua sive. He pointed to no specific datum from the Cinca article , and did not relate the article in any specific way to the issue at bar, e xcept to exclaim that the two wer e \"a fit.\" He in no w ay descr ibed how a specific cerebellar finding was more related to merc ury toxicity or exposure, or how it would make merc ury the best choice as causa tive factor. What other choice s are there in the differ ential diagnosis? What would lead him to exclud e or demote the other possibili ties? Dr. Shane never explained. Another point from the Cinca article upon which Dr. Shane seized was a mention of satellitosis, which, as Dr. Shane interpre ts the autopsy slides, w as prese nt in one instance within100 Thomas Kolakowski's a utopsy slides: [T]hat [] is a cell [] underg oing degeneration and the neurog lial comes into that cell and is a bout to unde rgo transfor mation to assist in the remova l of that ce ll as it is degenerated, so you get this neurog lial cell that is attache d to the neuron like a little satellite. We did have one cell that I 'm convince d was sate llitos is. Tr. 3 at 624. Dr . Shane neve r explained how his putative observa tion of one of those c ells relate d in any aetiolog ic way to the cause of Thomas' death, or how it connec ted Thomas' case with the data in the Cinca article -as if the similar development of one such cell, without further explanation necessary , proved tha t the thimerosal in a vac cine dose cause d the dea th of Thomas, just the same as the consumption of pork contaminated with a poisonous dose of merc ury would cause death. To Dr. Shane , even c ells he did not observe prove his (une xplained) the ory: If this was so, Petitioners never put on evidence that it was so, which would have covered some distance in99 proffering a theoretical mechanism with specific characteristics on the \"can it\" question, which would then have been useful to check against specific cases like this one, in answering the \"did it\" question. Also, for something that, if true, might work to prove Petitioners' theory, Dr. Shane never once described how \"the cerebellar findings\" that he found were so specific to mercury toxicity and worked to align the Cinca study with the case of Thomas Kolakowski. Satellitosis is \"accumulation of neurological cells about neurons; seen are damaged.\" 100 DORLAND'S, supra, at 1658. -77-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 11/23/10 Page 77 of 177Well, you get satellitosis, you get these glial cells, these neura l glia that are going to phag ocytize these degenerated nerve cells. You get them conce ntrated in an area and it forms a neuronophagic nodule. That's something that occur s down the pike101 somewh ere. I didn't see neuronopha gic nodules, but you don't have to. That is a later stage in the process. I didn't have it here, but I did have the satellitosis and I certainly did have the neura l glial prolifer ation. And I did c ertainly have the neura l degeneration. Tr. 3 at 624-25. \" was all that separ ated Thomas' patholog ical finding s from the Cinca case, said Dr. Shane : It takes time for these neurons to underg o degeneration. It takes time for the satellitosis to occur . Then if we add more time to the system, which we didn't here, you will have the neuronopha gic nodules.... Thing s are not going to happen exactly as they would in an older child. So I wasn't that conce rned with the fact that I did not see neuronopha gic nodules, but I was very reassured in my opinion that I did have the other finding s, the neura l degeneration, the gliosis, the microg lial chang es as well as other glial chang es, oligode ndrog lia. And we did have at least one cell with some satellitosis so they're starting to come in and clean it up.... The satellitosis is the beginning o f that process. He didn't, in my mind, live long enoug h to develop the nodules. Tr. 3 at 625- 26. Aside from the neurona l findi ngs, Dr. Shane also noted that he saw simil arities betwee n Thomas' case and the Cinca data as they related to \"myocardial finding s\" as well. Tr. 3 at 626. Dr. Shane descr ibed the following indicia he perceived in Thomas Kolakowski's case as finding an analog in the Cinca ar ticle: [T]he interstitial edema ..., a subtle finding in this infant heart. The scatter ed inflammatory infiltrate of a mixed nature . And the early myocytic chang es in that102 septum. And these again are finding s that correlate with the finding s in the article . And I think they're signific ant, that we do have this correlation with this, the article descr ibes an interstitial myocarditis.... The article correlates very, very nicely and descr ibes the finding s that I saw. Tr. 3 at 626. Dr. Shane conclude d his direc t examination in chief by summarizing the conclusions of the examining patholog ist(s): Dr. Ross, prior to arriving at a conclusion, ... did engage three other forensic patholog ists, a pediatric patholog ist and another neura l patholog ist to revie w this case with him. The conclusion after those revie ws is that these patholog ists had great Neuronophagia destruction phagocytic action.\" DORLAND'S, supra, 1257.101 at 1213.102 -78-Case Document 181 Filed of rn over this c hild r eceiving the Hepta vax. This s eeme d to provide for them a link to thi s child's dea th and they recommended fur ther study . Tr. 3 at 628. When pr essed by the Court for the ba sis for such a conclusion, Dr. Shane explained: I believe their basis was that they did not have anothe r basis for this child's death. They had symptoms, which they repor t the symptoms of the gas, the decreased appetite, the respira tory finding s, and then they have finding s they saw at autopsy which would correlate with that, but they didn't have a cause . And I think they were again, searching for something beyond what they had and the one link that they saw that cause d them conce rn was the Heptava x administration. This was something that was a link that they were seizing upon. Tr. 3 at 629. Finally , he summarized his own opinion, that \"the ethyl merc ury which was contained in [Thomas Kolakowski's] hepatitis B vacc ine contributed to his dea th,\" say ing: [M]y reasons for that is when I looked at the central nervous system finding s, they correlate very, very, very closely with what is repor ted in the article by Cinca. They correlate very, very closely in what I have seen in merc ury deaths, and I have examined two of those. And it also correlates with this child's cardiac involvement which cause d the viscera l involvement, which relates back to the symptoms betwee n the time of that second injection and the time of death. So we can correlate the clinicals with what we have. The literature repor ts the myocardial finding s very close to what we have seen. And it's inesca pable that this child had the viscera l cong estion, and you're not going to get that amount of cong estion in a matter of minutes or even an hour. It takes ti me for the pul monary edema to occur . It takes time for the cerebral edema , to this degree, to occur . So I believe this child had a n ongoing pr ocess. I believe this c hild died very, very sub-re cently to the time that it was discovere d. The baby was still warm. The baby still had PEA, pulseless electrical activity . The PEA continued into the hospital. The baby continued to maintain tempera ture into the hospital. I'm sure as a result of the PEA. And I think the clinical patholog y goes together very, very nicely in relating the causa tion to the merc ury containing compound. Tr. 3 at 629- 30. At least at the outset, Respondent's cross-e xamination of Dr. Shane consi sted largely of challeng ing Dr. Shane's credentials, and the accuracy of his filed curriculum vitae . The first line of such questioning focuse d on his expertise in toxicolog y, as Dr. Shane is board- certified in Chemistry and Toxicolog y by the Americ an Board of Clini cal Pathology , which he said certifies him to perform labora tory work if necessary , although he delegate s lab work by contra ct to labora tories. Tr. 3 at 631-32. His certification, he related, was \"primar ily focuse d on the interpre tation of labora tory testing including, in this case toxicology and chemistry testing.\" Tr. 3 at 633. Dr. Shane acknow ledged that he was not certified by a Ph.D. Toxicolog y board, and that he had not underg one the training for the Medica l Toxicolog y board that he understood to be part of Emerg ency Medicine -79-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 79 of 177expertise. Tr. 3 at 632, 634. Respondent challeng ed his expertise in forensic patholog y, and Dr. Shane explained that he has training and experience in that area, but is not board- certified in the specia lty. Tr. 3 at 634. Additionally , Dr. Shane admitted that he was not board- certified in Pediatric Pathology or Neur opatholog y, althoug h, he stated, he has training and extensive experience in both areas, having begun his patholog y practice befor e board certification had emer ged as a widespre ad or popular credentialing proce ss. Tr. 3 at 635-36. Dr. Shan e likewise conce ded that he did not possess board certification or specia l expertise in the fields of immunology , hepatolog y, nephrolog y or cardiology , said he did possess specia l expertis e throug h training and profe ssional experience in cardiovascular patholog y, and did have experience in immunologic test interpre tation, liver patholog y, and kidney biopsy . Tr. 3 at 663-664. Regarding the two cases of merc ury toxicity in his experience to which he had referred on direc t testimony , Dr. Shane conce ded that the poisoning case he had refer enced involved (inorg anic) merc ury salts, not (organic) ethyl mercur y, and that he did not re call the de tails of the other c ase. Tr . 3 at 662-63. Respondent's questioning revealed that Dr. Shane did not actively teach any students, even though he maintains a relationship with one medical colleg e, and was not deriving income from any university for teaching . Tr. 3 at 637- 641. His private pr actice retains consulting phy sicians when neede d, but only employ s Dr. Shane direc tly, althoug h he does maintain an office staff prese nce. Tr. 3 at 642-43. Dr. Shane 's work a s a litiga tion consultant and expert witness fills twenty to twenty - five percent of his time, and composes the same approximate share of his income. Tr. 3 at 650-51. He testifies in hearings, depositions, etc. between ten and fifteen ti mes per y ear. Tr. 3 at 658-59. Respondent also questioned Dr. Shane about his publicat ions and his testimony within specific cases, but the se are of de minimis relevance to the matter at hand, and the Court doe s not summar ize that here. In one particula r case raised by Respondent, Dr. Shane wrote conflicting, apparently contra dictory opinions for opposing parties to the same lawsuit, based on differ ing records provided to him by each side. Tr. 3 a t 713-724. Dr. Shane noted that his opinion does not rely upon or acknow ledge the expert opinions of Dr. Lucier or Dr. Connor, and that he did not communicate with either, or read their expert repor ts, prior to composing his own. Tr. 3 at 666. Dr. Shane did agree with Dr. Connor's hearing testimony that the EKG readings from the EMTs and the hospital were \"mea ningle ss for deter mining the root cause of Thomas' cardiac arrest.\" Tr. 3 at 667. He also stipulated that cardiac arrest is part of dying, not nece ssarily a cause there of. Id. Dr. Shane admi tted that he was not aware of cardiac effects of merc ury toxicity until he began research on the instant case(s). Tr. 3 at 667. The only medical literatu re of which he was aware that demonstrated ethyl merc ury toxicity affected the heart was Cinca, and he was not aware of any medical literature regarding the cardiac effect (if any) of thimerosal. Tr. 3 at 667-68. Neve rtheless, he thought the form and dosag e of the merc ury studied in the Cinca study was sufficie ntly analog ous to apply in analy zing thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines. Tr. 3 at 668-69. When Respondent asked Dr. Shane to compar e the blood levels of merc ury betwee n a vaccinee like Thomas Kolakowski and those recorded in the subjects in the Cinca study , Dr. Shane stated that to do so was \"complete ly irrele vant in the context of this case,\" because, \"You can't take the blood levels from older children and apply them to blood levels in an infant.\" Id. To Dr. Shane, the differ ences betwee n infants and older children or adults were so qualitatively distinct, the same dose -80-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 80 of 177response curve could not be seen as useful from one context to another , because of the greater perme ability of the blood-br ain bar rier in infa nts. Tr. 3 at 669. Dr. Shane's first expert repor t filed in this matter did not addre ss adver se effects in the heart, focusing instead entirely on the brain; it was only in his second repor t that he noticed aspec ts in the heart tissue which he then attributed to the thimerosal in the Hepa titis B vaccine. Tr. 3 at 671-72. Dr. Shane explained this appar ent disparity by stating that his first analy sis considere d seven differ ent cases, and that such revie w focuse d on the brain slides of each; it was only when this case was sele cted a s \"exemplar\" tha t his closer look reve aled the c ardia c effects. Tr. 3 at 672. When asked again later whether he thought \"dose deter mine[s] the toxic effect of an agent,\" he wa s relucta nt to ag ree: Again, you have to be very, very careful with dose and how you apply it. I'll use an example of a very common drug, acetaminophen. Acetaminophen in normal adults has a high dosag e range. You need to take 30 times the dosag e to exceed the capacity to cre ate the g lucuronide w hich is excreted. I f you exceed that, the ac etaminophen is chang ed to a dr ug that is liver tox ic and ve ry liver tox ic.... ...In infants, you can trigger liver damag e in children with the normal dose for children. It's because they don't have the prese nce of glucuronide manufa cture d by the liver to detoxi fy and excrete acetaminophen. So here is a drug with a normal pediatric dosag e that can cause liver damag e. The same thing in adults. An adult with liver impairment of any sort can trigger liver cell necrosis with regular thera peutic dosag es of acetaminophen. So when you talk about a dose relationship you're talking about, number one, children; you're talking about here an infant. So you again, like acetaminophen, normal or very small dosag es can precipitate catastrophe. So you can't rely on, if it's not a major dose it's not going to cause any damag e. That doesn't apply . It doesn't apply in children and it doesn't apply in some adults.... ...There isn't a specific dose, particula rly in infants, wher e you could say this dose is okay and this dose is tox ic. You ca n't do that....103 Acetaminophen i n normal dosag es ca n cause liver necrosis in children and even in adults with liver cell damag e. Normal dosag e can be fatal. So dosag e isn't the final word, particula rly when dealing with infants. And it's not a chang e in pharma kinetic proper ties, it's a chang e in how infants absorb the compound, how infants deal with the compound, how infa nts pass the compound into the brain. Tr. 3 at 699-701. When Respondent challeng ed Dr. Shane's statement in his expert repor t that age was a greater de terminant of toxicity than was dosa ge, Dr . Shane re plied: This statement would appear to contradict Petitioners' toxicologist, Dr. Lucier, who went into some detail103 describing how he and several others collaborated to arrive at a reference dose, which is an average daily dose that is putatively \"safe\" for almost anyone. -81-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 81 of 177[T]herapeutic dosag es of some substances like commonly used substances, acetaminophen, can be toxic, can be fatal, at recommended dosag es.... A little bit can cause physiologic damag e. Again, it's a very, very individual thing and when you're dealing with infants it's a highly individual thing because infants are not small adults. Tr. 3 at 702. Howeve r, even apply ing this rule could not explain why Thomas Kolakowski died in response to receiving the Hepa titis B vaccine. When Re spondent asked Dr. Shane, \"Why isn't the normal child experiencing signific ant granula r loss whene ver they get vaccinated with a thimerosal containing vaccine,\" considering \"the blood/brain barrier is not up and running ,\" his response was simply that, \"The y're differ ent. Eac h child is differe nt.\" Tr. 3 a t 703. This led Respondent to question Dr. Shane as to why more children were not damag ed in the manner Thomas was: Q Simi larly, wouldn't you expect if the blood/brain barrier is not up and running , that thimer osal containing vaccinations would just ravage normal children' s Purkinje cells? A I can't say that. Each child is an indiv idual. Each child will respond differ ently . We know what we ha ve her e, and tha t's what's important. I n Thomas Kolakowski we have a child who has tremors of some type, we have a child who after he receives the second shot has clinical symptoms of abdominal problems, decreased appetite, respiratory problems. This child is symptomatic.... This child then g oes on to a de ath and at autopsy this c hild ha d the finding s that we'r e talking about. And the whole thing comes together with a very, very nice clinical patholog ic correlation supported by the literature . Tr. 3 at 704- 05. When asked, Dr. Shane did not know the amount of ethyl merc ury contained in the vaccine doses administered to Thomas Kolakowski, and, further more, he did not think that such knowledg e was relevant: \"I don't think quantitative toxicolog ic deter minations of tissue levels of ethyl merc ury would chang e anything.\" Tr. 3 at 707-08. Respondent carried this defenestration of the dose relationship t o a reductio ad absurdum : Q I'm asking you, Doctor, at what point would you see the signs in Thomas Kolakowski, because you say dose doesn't matter. So .1 microg rams? .001 microg rams? A It doesn't apply . You haven' t heard my testimony that precise dosag e levels don't apply in individuals with the toxic effec ts. So .1, if it's 1, whatever it is, we know we ha ve these effects so we know at that leve l in this infant it was toxi c. Tr. 3 at 708. Dr. Shane stated that he had no dispute with the conclusions made in Thomas Kolakowski's autopsy , which he summarized as diagnosing \"Sudden Infant Death\" (but not Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or SI DS), and noting a conce rn about the Hepa titis B vaccine. Tr. 3 at 670. Dr. Shane -82-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 82 of 177was very laudatory concerning the sampling of the tissues from Thomas Kolakowski's autopsy , calling worke d up.\" Tr. 3 a t 672. Dr. Shane also made much of the clinical symptoms experience d by Thomas Kolakowski befor e his dea th: [T]he clinicals are that this child was symptomatic betwee n the time of receiving the vaccine and dying. This child had respira tory difficulties. This child had gastrointestinal problems. This child had dec reased appe tite. And t his child had a rash. Tr. 3 at 674. This prompted the Court to question \"the signific ance of the rash,\" to which Dr. Shane replied tha t he thoug ht there ha d been a \"suggestion that this ra sh may have been ... pe diatric a cne [and tha t t]he signific ance of the rash could be a cutane ous manifestation of hyperse nsitivi ty.\" Tr. 3 at 674-75. When Respondent questioned what the hyperse nsitivi ty was direc ted at, whether at the merc ury in the thimerosal or to an antig en, Dr. Shane replied, \"Hypersensitivity to anything,\" but could not be more specific , he said, be cause \"it's a pa ucity of informa tion.\" Tr. 3 at 675. Dr. S hane ag reed that lividity was detected by the EMTs, which increase d befor e Thomas was pronounce d dead at the hospital. Tr. 3 at 676. Dr. Shane related this to his interpre tation of the EKG strips: [W]ith pulseless electrical activity the circulation of blood throug hout the body is very much diminis hed. That's why you don't have a pulse. That's why it's PEA and not a pulse. Tr. 3 at 676. When asked whether the finding of cardiac edema was consistent with hypoxic ischemia, Dr. Shane said it was not, based on his revie w of \"hundre ds and hundreds and hundreds of hypoxic hearts.\" Tr. 3 at 676. Instead, he views edema to be more common in cases of inflammation, based on his experience with hundreds of cases of myocarditis of various aetiologies,\" leading him to conclude that edema would be more consistent with \"myocarditis rathe r than an ischemic proce ss.\" Tr. 3 at 676-77. Later, Respondent asked whether he thought oligode ndrog lial swelling was a finding that would be consistent with hy poxic ischemia, to whic h Dr. Shane replied: It's not a finding I would rely on with hypoxic ischemia, and I'll tell you why. Because these are reactants that come in later. This would have to be a very, very long period of hypoxia ischemia. If this is a hypoxic encephalopathy due to ventilator brain then I see oligode ndrog lia. In an acute episode I don't think it's very consistent at all, and these oligode ndrocy tes or oligode ndrog lia are turned on, they are reactive. Tha t's why we ha ve the e nlarg ement. They are prolifer ated. And f or that to occur takes time. Time is the esse nce of that patholog ic cha nge. Tr. 3 at 686. Dr. Shane added that the timing he envisions w as \"certainly longe r than three or four hours.\" Tr . 3 at 687. -83-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 83 of 177When asked if the patholog ical finding s in the heart had been specific or nonspecific to mercury toxicity, Dr. Shane conce ded that, \"The y're non-spec ific finding s until the medical literature tells you that's what happens, then they become specific because you tie that finding to the medical literature .\" Tr. 3 at 677. The implication of that conce ssion is that the same cardiac finding s could be prese nt in a case with no merc ury involvement whatsoeve r, which Dr. Shane said would lead him to \"search for another cause of myocarditis.\" Id. Unfortuna tely, Dr. Shane exposed the illogic of his perspec tive reg arding the entire case in expl aining this point : [W]hen you have myocarditis, you have literature that tells you this happens with ethyl merc ury chloride toxicity. You have the administration of thimerosal. One plus one plus one is three and that takes it out of the realm of unknown or undeter mined aetiolog y and place s it into t he framewor k of this plus this plus this. We have the clinicals, we have the patholog y, and we have literature, and we have what we see. Tr. 3 at 677. Dr. Shane's explanation g ives the appea rance of scroung ing for supportive indicia to bolster the conclusion he desires as an idee fixe, instead of approa ching the indicia in an inductive, empirica l, diagnostic approa ch that could guide the Court's analysis helpfully . This problem was recurrent in Dr. Shane's te stimony . Dr. Shane acknow ledged that the case of Thomas Kolakowski, and others like it, were provided to Dr. Shane to deter mine whether merc ury toxicity had been a causa tive factor, which led him to focus on the centr al nervous system. Tr. 3 at 678. He focuse d initially on the cerebellar , granula r cells, because, in his \"in-de pth examination of the brain ... the chang es in the granula r cell layer and the chang es in the Purkinje cells [were] certainly prese nt.\" Tr. explained his analy tical approa ch as examining the brain slides and \"abnor malities,\" befor e compar ing those abnorma lities with his finding s so as to \"come to a conclusion as to what cause d these abnorma lities in the context of what else is prese nt in this body and what's the clinical history .\" Tr. 3 at 679. Specific ally, regarding those g ranula r cells of the cer ebellum and his estimate of twenty percent \"drop out,\" Dr. Shane admitted that, due to their high amount of chroma tin, those cells are104 very dense and difficult to differ entiate, and that his estimate of twenty percent is not an exact count, but a \"semi-quantitative\" estimate. Tr. 3 at 680. Respondent produced a printout of microscopic magnification of granula r cells, and challeng ed Dr. Shane to pick out granula r cells there in, to which Dr. Shane responde d: I can't see granula r cells but I do see tha t separa tion, a nd that separ ation to my eye is a pathologic chang e and it is due to a contrac ture in one of the layers that you're seeing , most likely the intensely cellular area is actua lly pulling away from the adjac ent tissue so that would indicate to me that there has been some loss of cells or stroma in that area causing this separ ation. So I think the separ ation is a patholog ic chang e. The patholog ic cha nge in the ce rebellum. I don't know wha t the cause is, Chromatin is \"the more readily stainable portion of the cell nucleus, forming a network of nuclear fibrils. 104 It is a deoxyribonucleic acid attached to a protein (primarily histone) structure base and is the carrier of the genes in inheritance. It occurs in two states, euchromatin and heterochromatin, with different staining properties, and during cell division it coils and folds to form the metaphase chromosomes.\" 359. Page 84 of 177but it is abnorma l. Ag ain, a possible ca use is ag ain, ty ing in with wha t I saw whe n I looked at these under my own microscope . It could be the cell loss in that granula r layer, tha t inner-g ranula r layer, is wha t's causing that shrinkag e. Tr. 3 at 682. Dr. Shane thus opined that his assessment of the granular cells in Thomas' slides rema ined consistent with the presumed effects of ethyl merc ury toxicity, and stated the basis for that opinion was \"the publications that support that type of chang e occur ring in the brain of individuals who have been poisone d with ethy l mercur y.\" Tr. 3 a t 686. Respondent quest ioned Dr. Shane about another autopsy finding that he had noted-deg eneration and necrosis of the Purkinje cells, which Dr. Shane had attributed to cases of ethyl mercury toxicity. Tr. 3 at 695. He based his opinion, \"that merc ury toxicity affects Purkinje cells,\" entirely on the Cinca a rticle, published photog raphs of \"abnor mal Purkinje cells with smaller outlines with abnorma l cell shape and with shortened exomes.\" Tr. 3 at 695-96. Howeve r, when asked if ne crosis of those Purkinje c ells was a char acteristic trait of asphy xia, Dr. Shane demur red, stating : No, it's not. It's a cerebellar chang e and it's not a marke r that I would use for hypoxic encephalopa thy. The section of the brain that's most sensitive to hypoxia is the hippocampus and I don't see any specific chang es in the hippocampus here beyond some of the neurona l necrosis that I see elsewhe re that would suggest hypoxia. So no, it's not a chang e that I would say is characteristic in any way, shape or for m of hy poxic enc ephalopa thy. Tr. 3 at 696-97. Dr. Shane conce ded that Purkinje cell necrosis was not at all inconsistent with asphy xia, just that it was \"not a finding that particula rly, in any particula r way, points to asphy xia.\" Tr. 3 at 697. He explained his thi nking on this subject: The cerebellu[m] is not e xtremely sensitive to asphy xia and hy poxia. The c erebral corte x is far more sensitive, and as I mentioned, the most sensitive area of the cerebral corte x is the hippocampus. If I was looking for hypoxia I would not be going to the cerebellum for these chang es, I'd be going to the corte x, and particula rly to the hippocampus for those cha nges. Tr. 3 at 697. Respondent raised the distinction betwe en karyorrhe xis (necrotic fragmentation of cell105 nuclei) and apoptosis (acceleration of prepr ogrammed cell death) with Dr. Shane, as had been done with Dr. Connor. Tr. 3 at 697. Respondent challenged Dr. Shane that one would not be able to distinguish between the two by \"viewing patholog ical slides like we have here, in the manner in which it was done,\" but Dr. Shane disag reed, insisti ng that one could identify \"the beginning of nuclea r fragmentation\" which he believed r epresented ka ryorrhe xis. Tr. 3 at 697-98. Karyorrhexis is \"rupture of the cell nucleus in which the chromatin disintegrates into formless granules which105 are supra, at 970. -85-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed Page 85 of 177Moving on to Dr. Shane's analy sis of Thomas' cardiac effects, Respondent asked Dr. Shane to label the EKG strips with what he saw as heart wave segments, and he labeled a rathe r extensive portion as all consisting of small QRS segments, althoug h he had difficulty doing so with great precision \"beca use the pa ttern [was] sl urred a little bit.\" Tr. 3 at 690-693. When challeng ed by Respondent t o cite peer-r eviewe d medi cal literature in support of his theory of sudden death cause d by merc ury toxicity, Dr. Shane did not comply , but restate d his theory of insult: Well, merc ury toxicity can lead to myocarditis. Myocarditis can result in a dysrhythmia, and many dysrhythmias are inconsiste nt with life. So that's how it would cause sudden dea th. Tr. 3 at 698. He disag reed with the suggestion that such a proce ss would have to occur \"[o]ver a long period of time,\" and insisted a person \"could die the very next day\" as a results of merc ury toxicity-related myocarditis, because \"whe n you trigger a dysrhythmia is not predic table, but you're at hig h risk for dy srhythmia ever y second y ou have inter stitial my ocarditis.\" Tr. 3 at 699. Dr. Shane agreed that \"ische mic, hypoxic injury cause s edema in the brain,\" and that \"edema in whateve r organ it mig ht oc cur in c auses the w eight of that org an to incre ase from its pre -edema state.\" Tr. 3 at 729-30. Howeve r, he contende d, in the case of Thomas Kolakowski, it was merc ury that cause d the incre ased or gan we ight: It did in this case by causing the centr al nervous system chang es that were prese nt in addition to the cerebral edema which was prese nt here. It did in this case by causing edema in the heart which added to the heart weight, although it's a very, very small heart in an infant. And the pa ssive cong estive cha nges in the lung s and visce ra are certainly related to the merc ury and the interstitial myocarditis that the merc ury cause d. Tr. 3 at 730. When questioned about the support for such a contention in the peer-reviewed medical literature , Dr. Shane referred to the Cinca study , which \"does talk about the cerebral edema and \"the interstitial myocarditis that we see,\" and \"does talk somewhat about the organ cong estion that occur s certainly if you have heart failure .\" Tr. 3 at 730-31. Finally , though, Dr. Shane admitted that these indicia were \"not specific to merc ury, but heart failure due to any cause will cause the organ cong estion that we see in the lungs and viscera .\" Tr. 3 at 731. When presse d further to comment as to whether \"finding s of cong estion in organs signific ant in determining cause of death,\" or whether they were nonspec ific, Dr. Shane answe red: They can be s pecif ic when you have the extensive cong estive chang es that y ou see in these lungs. This tells you a lot. It tells you that this is most likely a heart failure , and it tells you most likely this is heart failure over a prolong ed period of time because of the amount of incre ased weig ht that we have. And you correlate that further with the clinical history of respira tory symptoms, it correlates with a sub-ac ute, a semi-re mote cong estive heart failure that cause d the clinical respira tory insufficienc y and re sulted in this m assive incr ease in lung we ight to 180 g rams. -86-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 86 of 177Tr. 3 at 731-32. Given the fact that Dr. Shane reiter ated these points so frequently , the Court might have expected him to explain how those finding s or conclusions support a theory (neve r proff ered) of how thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines cause d sudden death. When asked the same question a second time, Dr. Shane stated that cong estion in the organs was not specific to merc ury toxicity: \"Of course not.\" Tr. 3 a t 732. When asked if cong estion in the org ans wa s a finding consistent with hy poxic ischemia a s a cause of death, Dr. Shane replied that \"conge stion would be caused by heart failure ,\" reg ardle ss of what cause d the heart failure . Tr. 3 at 732. But then Dr. Shane parried by stating that \"in this case we know what cause d the heart failure or dysrhythmia because we have the interstitial myocarditis.\" Id. When asked if alveolar dilation or capillar dilation in the lungs was consi stent with hypoxic injury , Dr. Shane said no, that it is \"far more consistent with heart failure ,\" and was inconsistent with hypoxic injury , because, \"With hypoxic injury you would not have cong estion of the lungs until you had heart failure , then the cong estion would begin and be ongoing for some period of time.\" Id. When asked if oral and nasal bleeding , such as was observe d in this case, was consistent with hypoxic ischemia, Dr. S hane insist ed that it was not, but that such a finding would be \"consistent with heart failure ,\" and that \"the bloody mucous, the bloody edema tous f luid is frequently ... found in the nos e and mouth respira tory tract [as] part o f the failure.\" Tr. 3 at 733. When presse d as to whether \"oral-nasal bleeding [was] commonly found i n SIDS cases,\" Dr. Shane did not view that as a common finding in SIDS cases, or \"a finding on which a diagnosis of SIDS w ould be based.\" Tr. 3 at 733-34. He adde d that in the case of Thomas Kola kowski, Dr. Shane pe rceived \"no other cause of ora l nasal bloody materia l other than the he art fa ilure.\" Tr . 3 at 734. Respondent querie d Dr. Shane as to why, since the medical examiner for Thomas Kolakowski's autopsy was board- certified in both Neur opatholog y and Forensic Pathology , why the medical examiner did not note or record any of the patholog ical finding s or conclusions reached by Dr. Shane. Tr. 3 at 737. Dr. Shane responde d by pointing out that the medical examiner did not perform a microscopic analy sis of Thomas' case, but relied solely on the gross finding s, which Dr. Shane repor ted was \"not uncommon for forensic patholog ists or medical examiners. They will prepa re the slides but they won't necessarily do a microsc opic study .\" Tr. 3 a t 737-38. Dr. Shane said this was indeed the case, even though the medical examiner retained sever al patholog ists to revie w the ca se. Tr. 3 at 738. When Respondent challeng ed Dr. Shane as to why no microscopic analy sis was perf ormed, Dr . Shane re plied: Not in the forensic arena. In the forensic arena very frequently you keep the tissues, you prepa re the slides in some cases, in some cases you don't even prepa re the slides, you just keep the tissues. And you opine, as Dr. Ross did, Dr. Ross did what I would expect the medical examiner to do. As I said, he's very, very, very good at what he does, and ve ry cautious. Tr. 3 at 738- 39. Respondent challeng ed a portion of Dr. Shane's written expert repor ts which postulated that \"thimerosal is ethyl merc ury, and the neurotoxicity of ethyl merc ury exceeds that of methy l merc ury, about which abundant litera ture e xists from accidenta l methy l merc ury poisonings throughout t he world.\" Tr. 3 at 708. When Respondent que stioned how methy l mercury poisoning studies c ould -87-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 87 of 177prove that ethyl merc ury was more neurotoxic than methy l merc ury, Dr. Shane could not provide any supportive reference in the filed medical literature , but asseve rated that \"ther e is literature out there ... so much literature in this case, that would indicate that ethyl merc ury is more toxic and achie ves highe r tissue levels than methy l mercury.\" Tr. 3 at 709. He added that he did not derive that point from Dr. Lucier 's opinion, but gleane d it from medical literature that is \"burie d in the large number of publications that have been submitt ed in this case as supportive.\" Tr. 3 at 710. Howeve r, he deferred to Dr. Lucier on the matter of toxicolog y, and deferred to Dr. Connor on the interpre tation of EKG r esults. Id. Shane hedg ed his defe rral to Dr. Connor, at lea st as it related to diagnosing c ongestive heart failure: We have a lot of lung problems patholog ically , and this child had respira tory problems befor e death. The cong ested liver is certainly there patholog ically . We had decreased appetite. So those cor relations, I don't nee d any one else for. Tr. 3 at 710- 11. Respondent also challeng ed the apparent non sequitur in Dr. S hane' s expert repor t, wher e he stated that, because ethyl merc ury is espec ially lipophili c, it is particula rly toxic to the brain, which contains many fatty components, such as myelin. Tr. 3 at 711. Respondent asked Dr. Shane whether he thought ethyl merc ury was compar atively more lipophili c than methy l merc ury, in a way that distinguished the two, or was otherwise relevant to the discussion. Id. Dr. Shane could not answe r specific ally, but said his impression \"take n off the top of [his] hea d,\" was that \"they would have simil ar tissue minding affinities.\" Id. He conce ded that \"to the extent [he distinguishing methy l merc ury [from] ethyl merc ury,\" he did not intend to ethyl merc ury is espec ially c and mercur y is less so.\" Id. When challeng ed on his statement, made in his expert repor t, that methy l merc ury's half life is varia ble, wit h certain individuals experiencing \"a profoundly longe r half life,\" Dr. S hane could not cite to a supportive source of this information, but stated that there were \"so many paper s\" that said so that were \"part of that general literature .\" Tr. 3 at 712. He said that such varia bility was based on \"phy sical condition,\" \"metabolism,\" and \"age.\" Id. When challeng ed as to why he did not provide supportive reference in his expert repor t for this formulation, Dr. Shane replied that it wa s \"such boiler plate of g ood tox icolog y that a citation wa sn't nece ssary .\" Tr. 3 a t 712-13. Finally and tellingly , the Court recites the following interchange, during which Dr. Shane admits that he can proff er no mecha nism of injury by which ethyl merc ury from a thimerosa l- containing vaccine could cause arrhythmia, interstitial myocarditis, cardiac arrest, or sudden death: Q ...[D] o you know what actua lly caused his death? Specifica lly the mecha nism? A Yes. I think that this was a death associated with ethyl merc ury toxicity. I think there are centr al nervous system manifestations that we talked about over and over. I think there are cardiac manifestations that we talked about. I think there are clinical finding s that go along with those cardiac manifestations that occur red prior -88-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 88 of 177to the evening of his demise. He was symptomatic. He did have these symptoms that correlate with heart failure . And this is, until prove otherwise, a heart failure death in face of interstitial myocarditis, and there is no other cause for the heart failure which was symptomatic prior to his going to bed that night befor e his death. Q So is m ercury in the brain, is that what c aused de ath her e? A Merc ury in the brain c aused c hang es in the bra in. That's ce rtain. Q Was it actual merc ury in the hear t that cause d death he re? A Actual mercury in the heart? I don't know i f that m echanism of interstitial myocarditis is direc tly due to the merc ury. It is an associate d finding with ethyl merc ury toxicity. I don't know that anyone has worke d out that precise mecha nism. If they have, I don't know about it. Q Was it an imm une proc ess that ca used dea th? A That's a very likely possibili ty. This could be an antig en antibody response . Certainly with antig en antibody response s you can have interstiti al myocarditis. It works with that finding . And certainly the timing of these events, a dose and then a challeng e later on, that speak for hyperse nsitivi ty. The skin rash may reflect hyperse nsitivi ty. And the myocarditis could be hyperse nsitivi ty. So yes, that would work. Q So it could have been antig en hyperse nsitivi ty, but your opinion and your patholog ical re view, y ou support the fa ct that it's merc ury toxicity, corr ect? A I talk about it being mercury toxicity. Again, in terms of the interstitial myocarditis, I don't know what the mecha nism for that was. It is a finding . It's a finding that is reporte d in ethyl mercury toxicity deaths. I see it here. One a nd one equals two. Q In either one of your repor ts, why didn't you draw, as a differ ential ty, an immunologic pr ocess? A I the immunologic I didn't ss the further mecha nism of the my ocarditis. But as y ou raise it, it cer tainly is a probability . Q So you don't rea lly know the mec hanism then. A I don't know the precise mecha nism of the myocarditis. Is there a strong possibili ty it's antige n antibody ? Yes, it works. Tr. 3 at 735- 37. 4. Jeffrey Brent, M.D. Dr. Brent worke d at the time of trial as a professor of pediatric s and internal medicine. Transc ript of Hearing on 24 June 2008 (Tr. 4) at 751. Dr. Brent has a Ph.D. in biochemistry and a Master' s degree in molecular biology , and he attended medical school at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Tr. 4 at 752. After medical school, he interned as a junior resident at Harvard, and -89-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 89 of 177\"ultimately completed a primary residenc y in emerg ency medicine a t Emory University School of Medicine, Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta.\" Id. There after, he underw ent \"a two-y ear subspecialty fellowship in the ar ea of medical toxicology .\" Id. Dr. Brent has been awarded a distinction by the Europea n Association of Poison Control Centers and Clini cal Toxicolog ists, is a member of profe ssional societies such as the Americ an College of Medica l Toxicolog y, the Americ an Academy of Clini cal Toxicolog y\" as well as \"the Europea n Association of Poison Control Centers and Clini cal Toxicolog ists.\" Tr. 4 at 753-54. He is actively engaged in peer revie w, reviewing approximately one ar ticle per week \"for a var iety of medical journals ... toxicolog y journals[,] ... the New England Journal of Medicine, [ ] the J ournal of the Americ an Medica l Association, a number of journals, both in the United States and worldwide.\" Tr. 4 at 754-55. He \"was Editor-in-Chief of a major revie w journal, the major critica l revie w journal in the world in the area of medical toxicolog y ... called Toxicolog ical Reviews,\" and has serve d as a senio r editor of Clini cal Toxicolog y for over a decade, \"which is the largest peer-reviewed or igina l resea rch publica tion in the area in the world.\" Tr . 4 at 756. Dr. Brent's private practice focuse s entirely on medical toxicolog y, and has treated \"quite a number\" of heavy metal toxicity patients pursuant there to, including sever al dozen patients with merc ury toxicity. Tr. 4 at 761. He has advised treating doctors as a consulting doctor on two or three times that many merc ury toxicity patients, wher e his expertise as a me dical toxi colog ist was necessary for treatment. Tr. 4 at 761-62. Most of the cases in the United States of merc ury toxicity come as a result of using merc ury in industrial or commerc ial applications, not throug h intake of organic mer cury, inasmuch as \"organic mercury poisoning in this country is ex tremely , extremely rare. You don' t really see ma ny case s of that.\" Tr . 4 at 763-766. Dr. Brent testified that there are betwee n 300 and 400 medical toxicolog ists in the entire United States, and that there are a \"seve ral hundred in Europe[,] ... just a handful in South Americ a and Afric a[,] ... [and] a couple dozen in the Middle East.\" Tr. 4 at 771. An exact figure is only possible in this country because only here is there an officia l certifying body that registers their member tally. Id. Dr. Brent himself is quite acqua inted with this fact, because he has serve d as \"one of the elected board of direc tors of the Americ an College of Medica l Toxicolog y,\" and thus has \"a very good sense of what the entire field is about.\" Tr. 4 at 773. \"In addition, one of [his] duties at the Americ an College of Medica l Toxicolog y is ... Chair of the Practice Commi ttee, so [he is] very aware of all the aspec ts regarding toxicolog y certification in me dicine.\" Id. He also stated that the Americ an Board of Pathology does not ha ve a specific board certification for toxicolog y, nor does it \"offe r any credentialing in ... medical toxi colog y.\" Tr. 4 a t 774. Dr. Brent differ entiated medical toxicolog y from the study of toxicolog y outside of the medical c ontext thusly : [T]oxicolog y in general is just simply the scienc e of the adver se effects of chemica l substances on living sy stems. So you know, i t could be anybody study ing adver se effects of a ny chemica l. It could be on plants, it could be on pe ople, it could be on fish, and so on. So there 's no actua l formal requirements for calling yourself a toxicologist. In contra st, there are for calling yourself a medical toxicolog ist. -90-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 90 of 177Medica l toxicolog y is a recognized subspecialty by the Americ an Board of Medica l Specialties, which is the oversight organization of all the medical specia lties, and there are very define d specia lties and subspecialties. And medical toxicolog y is a very define d subspecialty . And a medical toxicolog ist, there fore, is a physician who, by virtue of completing an accredited post-residenc y two-y ear fellowship, and completing an ex amination, which I have to sit for a recertification periodica lly, is subspecialty board- certified to act as a medical toxicologist, and to ca ll themselves a medica l toxicolog ist. Tr. 4 at 770. Dr. B rent discussed the clinical sy mptoms and sequelae of merc ury exposure and toxi city: [F]or those people who inhale merc ury vapors and get very sick very fast, we're talking there about just elementa l merc ury, or you know, quicksilver. The first thing that happens is it goes to your lungs, it's very active on your lungs, and cause s a sever e pulm onary syndrome. And the n you can evolve int o multipl e-organ sy stem failure very quickly . Your kidney s will fail, you can have seizures. Once you get past the acute stage, very often these people will, over a period of time, develop a more typical merc ury-related syndrome, which would be consistent, which is typically a tremor, constriction of visual field, an articula tion problem with regard to speec h, some ataxia, difficulty walking , periphe ral neuropa thy involving the sensory nerve s. ...Sometimes people are stuck with a little bit of periphera l neuropa thy. It depends, you know, if you're really seriously merc ury-poisoned, you can have more sever e seque lae. Tr. 4 at 766- 67. Dr. Brent confr onted Petitioner s' ultimate theory of causa tion for epheme ral, and, he believes, a lmost i mpossible quality , espec ially to tox icolog y: I didn't really hear a lot of a sort of coher ent hypothesis of exactly what happe ned. I know Dr. Lucier did not offer any specific opinion about Thomas Kolakowski. Dr. Connor, as I recall, and correct me if I'm wrong , on cross-e xamination when he was asked a bout that, said he thoug ht it was an immunological reac tion to the vac cine. And Dr. Shane, I don't recall him actua lly, he didn't actua lly articula te a specific hypothesis that I could put my finger on in terms of what actua lly killed Thomas Kolakowski, and how this was rela ted to merc ury. Tr. 4 at 768. He conclude d that reaching the conclusion urged by Petitioners \"is impossibl e.\" Tr.106 4 at 769. Dr. B rent discussed the qualities and history of thimerosal a nd its use: \"I would say as close as we can ever say in science -- you always learn never say always, never say never. 106 But I would say it's as close to impossible as anything I've ever seen in medicine.... I would say it is neither plausible nor possible.\" Tr. 4 at 769. -91-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 91 of 177Thimerosal is a prese rvative. If you look at the history of thimerosal, it's been used in pharma ceutica ls since about, as far back as I can tell, the 1920s. There was an original safety study done in 1931 by Powell and Jamieson. For its time, it was a very excellent safety study . It pales in compar ison with the kind of safety studies that we would c onsider to be appropriate today .... [Its first widesprea d application wa s as a prese rvative of blood plasma, used during World War II for combat trauma wounds.] And the experience was, and it's been well published, it's very well tolerate d. Tr. 4 at 774-75. He counter ed Dr. Lucier 's statement that the use of thimerosal in vaccines came to light only around 1999: \"I guess that's when Dr. Lucier may have discovere d that it was in vaccines, but certainly it's been -- it's been on the product label, in the packa ge insert, for as long as packa ge inserts have been around, t o my knowledg e.\" Tr. 4 at 777. Likewise, he counte red Dr. Connor's depiction of thimerosal as \"an activator to help distribute the vaccine into the tissue.\" Tr. 4 at 778, citing Tr. 2 at 472-73. \"I'm not sure wher e he got it. But no, it doesn't do anything like that. Thimerosal is simply a pre serva tive.\" Tr. 4 at 778. Dr. B rent c larified a point potentially clouded by Dr. Lucier 's testimony , that ethyl merc ury is one of two sever able parts of the thimerosal molecule, but it does not constitute half of a vaccine; it is betwee n one and five one-thousandths of a per cent of the vac cine' s constituent parts. Tr. 4 a t 779 Next Dr. Brent focuse d on the centr al question of causa tion, and he began by addre ssing the difficulty of ty ing g eneral or diff use sy mptoms t o specific chemica l toxicity (a point also made by Dr. Lucier ). Tr. 4 at 780. This difficulty is surmounted by a scientific proce ss characterized by Dr. Brent as a \"formula\" and a \"formal exercise that absolutely must be done.\" Tr. 4 at 780-81. This proce ss \"involves three ... the ch.\" Tr. 4 at 781 (emphasis added) . He started with the \"wha t\" question, which involves identify ing the substances to which the patient has been exposed: \"The first question is what was the person exposed to. And if they were exposed to a chemica l, what were they exposed to, how much, what was the dose.\" Tr. 4 at 781. For the Court, this question is typically answe red as a questio n of fact from medical records, and vaccination records i n particula r. Dr. Bren t continued, to addre ss progression t o the questi ons of \"can it \" and \"did it\": [O]nce you've identified what the chemica l condition is, the next question is can that particula r chemica l exposure cause the particula r condition, the particula r disease in question. If it can't cause that disease, the n you can stop rig ht there. I f it can, then you have, then you have to go to the next step. ...I think the first is what you call in the general causa tion, if I understand that correctly . The next thing is if the chemica l can cause the disease in general, did it cause the disease in this specific individual. I think that's what I believe is called specif ic causa tion. And that depends on the circumstances of the exposure. I mean, we 're all exposed to chemica ls all the time that can c ause lots of proble ms. As we sit here in this room, we're breathing in all kinds of chemica ls. So the question is, is the chemica l capable of causing the condition; and if so, were the exposure conditions appropr iate. Was it the right dose of the c hemical. Was it a sufficie nt dose of the c hemical to ca use the proble m that is being investiga ted. -92-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 92 of 177Tr. 4 at 781-82. The Court, and the Undersigne d in particula r, has long relied on such an approach. Part and parcel to the question of \"can it,\" explained Dr. Brent, is taking into107 considera tion the dosag e of the exposure: [Dosage ] is the most fundame ntal thing we look at.... This goes back to Parac elsus, who was actua lly one of the individuals who provided the early108 detailed descr iptions of mercury toxicity. But the axiom of Paracelsus is probably the most fundamental pr inciple of toxi colog y today .... If you want to make an assessment about whether a chemica l cause d an adver se effect, the fundame ntal question is did the person get the sufficie nt dose. As Parac elsus said in his translation, poison isn't everything, and no thing is without poison. The dosag e make s it either a poison or a reme dy.... And s o the real question is what was the dos e, was the dose sufficient to cause the condition. If it is capable, if general causa tion exists. And so we have this dose-r esponse relationship. And as you see there, as we say, there 's no such t hing as poisonous substances, there are only poisonous doses. And that's true of all things. Tr. 4 at 782-83. He added that dosag e rema ins \"the most fundame ntal principle\" in medical toxicolog y. Tr. 4 at 784. He quoted f rom a we ll-respe cted Toxicology source (Casar ett & Doull) to state: The characteristic of exposure and spectrum of effects come together in a correlative relationship customarily referred to as the dose-r esponse relationship. This relationship is the m ost fundame ntal and pervasive concept in toxicolog y. Indeed, it is an understanding of this relationship that is essential for the study of toxic materia ls. Tr. 4 at 786. Also, he quoted f rom a c linical tox icolog y textbook ( Clini cal Environme ntal Health and Toxic Exposure s) to state: One of the most important conce pts in toxicolog y is the dose-r esponse relationship. The underly ing premise is that any compound can be toxic if it is encounte red in large-enoug h doses. No matter what the compound's potency or how little a See Pafford v.

Tr. 4 at 787. Dr. Brent described the dose-r esponse curve as \"a bell-shape d curve ,\" which means \"different individuals will require a differ ent dose to have the same effect. Most individuals will be someplace quite near the cente r of the curve , but ... about 95 percent of the population will be someplace in that curve .\" Tr. 4 at 788. This does not mean that individuals at the extreme of the curve 's distribution will be \"hy per-susceptible,\" how ever: Hyper-susceptibility to a chemica l is something very, very differ ent. Hyper-susceptibility is what you see here, wher e there is a population of individuals that have a dos e-response curve that has shi fted al l the way over to the left, so that they respond to chemica ls at doses well below what the general population responds to.... You would have a dose-r esponse relationship, it would just be at much lower doses. Tr. 4 at 788. Along the same vein, when asked whether \"a genetically susceptible population to merc ury [has] ever been identified,\" Dr. Brent responde d, \"No. There is no known accepted hyper-susceptible population to merc ury toxicity.\" Tr. 4 a t 789. Discussing the scientific validity of Dr. Lucier 's defense of \"look[ing] at produc ts that are simil ar, and extrapolat[i ng] what is known to the unknown\" (Tr . 1 at 47), Dr . Brent stated: It depends on wha t you are doing it for. If you are a regulator, and y ou're trying to come up with regulations, then, of necessity, you have to make assumptions . You have to make assumptions to fill in what y ou don't know.... Whether that' s true or not is not known. It could be, they could be very diffe rent. But in the regulatory community , wher e you have to make regulations, wher e you have to come to conclusions, you tend to make a lot of assumptions.... So for those purposes it is an accepted thing to do. Tr. 4 at 791. Howeve r, outside of an extra-pre cautious regulatory realm, Dr. Brent finds it important to rea lize the likelihood of lar ge diffe rences betwe en compounds: In terms of a sking the question, does this particular molec ule ac t simi lar to anothe r molecule that has some chemica l simil arity to it, on a scientific basis, that's very differ ent. You cannot. Because one of the things we know, that very, very small chang es in a molecule can cause it to have very, very different proper ties, toxicolog ical prope rties. ...[For instance, if you] want to know what happens to methanol by study ing ethanol, ... you would be profoundly , profoundly misled. Because methy l alcohol [is] what's found sometimes in contaminated moonshine. If you drink methanol, you are likely to die. And if you get insufficient dose to die , you are likely to end up perma nently blind. It's a profound retinal toxin. That's methanol. Ethanol, on the other hand, as we were just talking about, has some actua lly not-so-bad proper ties. And it only takes re ally huge, hug e doses be fore you get yourself into a lot of problems, befor e -94-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 94 of 177you get yourself into a lot of problem s, or taking large doses over a very chronic period of time. So methanol and ethanol are drama tically differ ent compounds in terms of their toxicolog ical proper ties. And trying to study one to get an idea of what the other one does can be extremely misleading .... There are some simil arities between methy l merc ury and ethyl merc ury, but there are also some profound differ ences. Tr. 4 at 791-95. Additionally , he agreed that \"significant scientific literature [] demonstrates that ethyl and methy l merc ury are actua lly quite differ ent\" in their toxicologic proper ties, and that the main body of medical literature does not equate the two for purposes of toxicolog ic study . Tr. 4 at 795. He cited the Casare tt & Doull te xt to say that \"no other [metal] better illust rates the diversity of effects caused by differ ent che mical spec ies than does mer cury.\" Tr. 4 a t 796-97. Moving on, D r. Brent discussed the EPA reference dose that formed the foundation of Dr . Lucier 's testimony . In contra distinction to Dr. Lucier 's statement that exceeding the reference dose in a singula r exposure threa tens an individual with incre ased risk for neurologic al injury (Tr. 1 at 222), Dr. B rent c larified tha t the ref erence dose is an avera ge daily dosag e below w hich any one is virtually sure to be unsymptomatic. Tr. 4 at 797-98. Dr. Brent disag reed with Dr. Lucier 's109 statement about compar n organomer curia ls (as demonstrated supra ), stating that the reference doses as betwee n methy l and ethyl merc ury are differ ent, because \"[t]hey are diffe rent compounds,\" and because the EPA assig ns advisory reference doses only for specific chemica ls,110 and only when they are deeme d to pose a sufficie nt risk; the EPA has never assig ned a reference dose for ethyl merc ury or for thimerosal. Tr. 4 at 798. Dr. Brent likewise argued that the EPA's reference dose is not a safe/unsafe demar cation which, if exceede d, would more likely than not lead to adver se effects: What the reference dose is, is it's a dose below which the EPA will say we don't think anybody is going to have any problem. It is generally set very far below the level at which anybody would say there is likely to be a problem. Because the position i s alway s that we don't know. ...[W ]e start with a dose wher e we know that somebody will have a problem, that may be adver se to the population; and then we very drama tically lower that dose by accounting for uncer tainty , by putting in what they call uncer tainty factors. And they ultimately come up with a dose that we say, well, we're pretty comforta ble saying if you're all the way down here, you're going to be pretty safe. But, and they don't say if you're above tha t, you're nece ssarily going to ha ve toxi city. Tr. 4 at 799. He said that this same logic was opera tive in desig nating the reference dose for methy l merc ury: Both the reference dose and the benchmark dose are distinct from the threshold dose: \"For any given109 chemical exposure, you have to get to a certain dose before you're going to have an adverse effect.\" Tr. 4 at 838. \"[W]hat is applicable to one is not necessarily applicable to the other. Generally you don't apply a reference110 dose from one compound to another compound, because you base the reference dose specifically on data on that particular chemical.\" Tr. 4 at 798. -95-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 95 of 177[The EPA researchers tried] to come up with the most sensitive end point they [could] find for an adver se effect on humans. That's wher e you start. And then you put in your uncer tainty factors under that. And if you remember, we talked about Minamata disease, wher e it was shown that in the population that took methy l merc ury, the individuals who tended to get sick were the children who were exposed in utero . And sometimes the mothers would be perfectly fine, yet the children would be profoundly affected by the methy l merc ury when they were exposed to it in utero , throug h the mother. So they chose, there fore, as their most sensitive population prena tal exposures. And so, and then they looked and they found the most sensitive measure that they could find for adver se effect, based on prena tal exposures to methy l merc ury, and they used that to set, as a starting point to set the reference dose. And then they put in all their uncer tainty factors. Tr. 4 at 800-801. More to the point of the centr al question in this matter , Dr. Brent did not believe that the EPA ref erence dose for methy l mercur y was ba sed on the potential for cardiac e ffects: The reference dose, the most sensitive end points that they could find were really based on some very sensitive neuropsy cholog ical testing that was done on a heavily merc ury-exposed population in the Faroe Islands. And s o it was really based on111 Dr. Brent went into some detail concerning the methods and data of the Faroe Islands studies:111 [W]hat they did was, at birth, they took a large number of parent-child, parent-newborn pairs. And they studied them at birth, and then they prospectively followed them over a period of a number of years. And the study is still going on. And at various points over the years, they evaluated them, they evaluated these children. And one of the things that they did at the time of birth is they got umbilical cord, they got umbilical cord blood, blood from the placenta that was going to the mother. And they measured the mercury concentration in the blood. And they also did hair. And so they were able to correlate any effects that they saw with the mercury levels that these children were exposed to in utero.... [T]he reason they used this group is because this is a much more heavily methyl-mercury-exposed population than in the U.S.... [T]he average concentration of mercury in the umbilical cord blood, in the Faroe Islands, was a little over 22 micrograms per liter. Now, that is a way, way high level.... To give you a point of reference, in the U.S. almost all blood mercury levels for people is under about 10 micrograms per liter. So here they have a population that chronically runs much higher blood mercury level related to methyl mercury than in the U.S. They followed this whole cohort out for up to 14 years, and they've been studying them periodically.... What they have found over that period of time is that for all intents and purposes, these children are perfectly normal. There have been no clinically observed defects that they have been able to find that are at all related to -- because they look at each child with respect to what their prenatal exposure had been, because they had determined that. And they have not been able to find any clinically obvious effect that is related to either their prenatal exposure to methyl mercury, or their prenatal exposure to PCBs.... what they did is at various points along the way, they tested them with very sensitive neuropsychological testing techniques. And they saw that in some of the children with the higher cord blood levels, that they could find some abnormality on these tests that were correlated with how high the blood level was. It was probably related to the methyl mercury. ...Another thing, by the way, and this is a bit of a confounder in that study ... is that the pilot whales also contain a good deal of PCBs. And PCBs are known to potentially have adverse effects on outcomes, intellectual outcome in children, as well.

There 's nothing in the reference dose whatsoeve r about any adver se ca rdiac effects. Tr. 4 at 801. Dr. Brent also spent some time disc ussing the statistical a nalysis that went into assig ning a safety reference dose for methy l mercur y: They took a point wher e five percent of the children are likely , wher e five percent of the children had a substandard score on the Boston Naming Test. And they looked, and the a verage cor d merc ury level for those children w as, as you can se e ther e, 85 microg rams per liter. So that's pretty high. Remember, in the U.S. it's under 10.... [T]he 85 microg rams per liter was an average. And there was, of course , a bell-shape d curve, two standard deviations. And the way you can express two standard deviations is either in terms of a bell-shape d curve , or what's called confide nce intervals ... and they took the lower limit s of the confide nce intervals as a safety factor; not just the average value, but the lower limit of the confide nce interval. And so they found some children would be down as low as 58 microg rams per liter. And so they took that 58 microg rams per liter, and they put in then a safety factor or an uncer tainty factor of 10. And s o they got down t o 5.8 microg rams per liter in blood. And they said basica lly, for the purposes of our reference dose, we think if anybody can get their blood level down in the 5.8 microg rams per liter, they're fine [meaning ] no chanc e of any adver se effects, based on this Boston Naming Test. And then they said well, how much methy l merc ury will you have to ingest in order to get 5.8 microg rams per liter of blood. And you can calculate that, this data allows you to calculate it. And the calculation basica lly came out to be if you ingest 0.1 microg ram per kilogr am per day of methy l merc ury, your blood level should be about 5.8. So that's where the reference dose of 0.1 microg ram per kilogr am per day112 came from. I t's based on a sensitive neurolog ical indicator in prena tal exposures. Tr. 4 at 806- 07. Next, Dr. Brent discussed the National Academy of Science s' benchma rk dose (BMD), and how t hat figure could have been confounde d by the prevalenc e of PCBs in the Faroe Island data. The benchma rk dose used for methy l merc ury was based, said Dr. Brent, on \"the level of cord merc ury in the blood tha t was necessary to cause a n adver se effect on ... the Boston Naming Test\" among the Faroe Island subjects. Tr. 4 at 808. Howeve r, the researchers chose not to factor out the PCB eff ects fr om their data, a s a pre caution, which ma y have ske wed their data f indings: The Court notes again that calculating an intake rate based on a certain blood level requires making112 standardizing assumptions about blood retention and clearance rates, which vary across a human population. Also, based on the Burbacher data, which demonstrate that methyl mercury is retained much longer in the bloodstream than ethyl mercury, it is quite clear that the same 0.1 \u00ecg/kg/day ratio set for methyl mercury is not transferably applicable to ethyl mercury. -97-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 97 of 177[W]hen they adjusted for PCBs, for the adver se effects of PCBs, then it's actua lly require d a methy l merc ury level of 184 micrograms per liter to have this adver se effect on the Boston Naming Test with a lower confide nce interval of 71. But it was felt for technical reasons not to adjust for PCB. It was a regulatory decision; you alway s err on the conser vative side on regulatory decisions. So they just used the unadjusted fig ure.... [The EPA] used this exact table from the National Academy of Science s. And once again, for the EPA risk assessments, they used the una djusted g roup.... [H]ad they taken it into account, then what would have happene d is, if you'd look at that formalism, the actua l value that would have been necessary on the average to cause the adver se effect they were looking at the Boston Naming Test was about 184 microg rams per liter in blood. Once again, reme mber, in the United States we tend to be under about 10 microg rams per liter.... [F]rom there they would have had to calculate a r eference dose, w hich would have been hig her tha n the cur rent one . Tr. 4 at 809- 10. Dr. B rent e xplained the implications of the r esearchers' pre cautionar y decision: Well, as it should be, the reference dose is a very conser vative number. It's based on prena tal exposures. It's got these large safety factors involved, by taking the m ost sensitive test, and not taking the average value, but taking the lower end of the confide nce interval, and then dividing it further by 10. So it has a lot of safety built into it, which is exactly what y ou want to do when you are coming up with a safety factor, with a re ference dose. Tr. 4 at 810. Dr. Brent believed that most of the adver se effects measure d in the Faroe Island studies could be attributed to the PCBs that we re quite prese nt in the diet of that study 's subjects, but not in that of the Sey chelles subjec ts: [T]he Seychelles study basica lly is running parallel with the Faroe Islands study . And they're doing the same thing, you know, periodica lly testing the children based on their exposures prena tally. And they have not been able to find any adver se effects with me thyl mercury exposures. There 's pretty much the same levels as the Faroe Islands. Now, the one differ ence is that the Seychelle Islands, they don't have the compoundi ng factor of the PCBs exposure. I'm not clear whether that's the reason or not, but they have not been able to find any adver se effects. So we see here that even in this population, that is taking very large amounts of seafood, certainly compar ed to the United States, and putting much more methy l merc ury in their brain than in the United States, that they 're really not having any adver se effects. Tr. 4 at 819. Another point made by Dr. Bre nt is that the refer ence dose was based on chronic , average daily intake over a lifetime: -98-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 98 of 177So if you look at people in the Faroes, ... [t]hey are alway s up at that particula r level. On the other hand, in t he U.S. as I said, we' re almost alway s under 10. Very often we're around two or three , particula rly in children, sometimes even less than that.... But they're almost alway s well under 10. And then goes quickly back down. Versus what happens in the Faroe Islands, wher e, unrela ted to vaccination, these people are alway s up at a much hig her le vel. So the Far oe Islands is more of sort of a chronic situation, where they 're alway s up there . And t hat's what they based the reference dose on. Not, y ou know, these little blips, like you see with a vaccination. But the reference dose is really based on Faroe population, which is chronic ally running very high. Tr. 4 at 812-13. To Dr. Brent, this means that it is incorre ct to say that thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines would expose children to merc ury in a dose that \"excee ds the safe level,\" to the poi nt of potential adver se outcome, a s Dr. L ucier had intoned: [What] he called a safe level, simply refers to the reference dose. It [does not mean] that if you exceed that level, you necessarily are going to have an adver se effect, because of the large difference between the reference dose and the data that shows wher e you'd have an adver se effect. And it's also, reme mber, it doesn't take into considera tion that on a day-to-day basis, sometimes you'll have very little exposure. ...[T] here are many , many people, particula rly fish-ea ting populations, who are well above the 5.8 level. We saw in the Far oes, they live at about 22. Nobody has eve r shown an a dverse effect clinically , from the pe ople living ther e. 113 Tr. 4 at 813-14. This reasoning also undermined Dr. L ucier 's claim that 60,000 children per year are born \"at risk\" due to materna l exposure to methy l merc ury over the level of the reference dose. Tr. 4 at 816-17. More importantly to the issue at bar, Dr. Brent stated that there was \"absolutely no data whatsoeve r that that kind of exposure [i.e., exceeding the reference dose] would cause cardiac arrest\" or cause a highe r risk for it. Tr. 4 at 817. He discussed the paucity of evidenc e for any such incre ase in observe d incidence or risk for adver se cardiac outcomes within the populations studied closely for mer cury toxicity: The Seychelles population which, you know, which is being very well studied prospectively, there has not been a single repor t of any adver se cardiac effects, cardiac arrests in any of the children. The same thing in the Faroe population, with a much highe r exposure. There has not be en, just like the Sey chelles, there has not been a ny repor ts of adver se ca rdiac events like c ardia c arrests in the childre n. Tr. 4 at 820. Dr. Brent did qualify this statement as follows:113 Although clearly when you get to the higher cord blood levels, they, you know, and you test the children, they do find that you can find, in the Faroes, they do find some detriment in performance. Tr. 4 at 814. -99-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 99 of 177At one point, the Court raised a point made by Dr. Lucier to explain the differ ence in results betwee n the Faroe Island study and the Seychelles study , the varia bility of intake schedule and amount consumed be tween the two: THE C OURT: Did not Petitioner's experts discourse about the steady , consistent , chronic exposure in the Seychelles, versus the episodic exposur e in the Faroes, because of the consumption of whale? Which I gather was stacc ato, was not as steady . And they made something about it, if I recall. THE WITNESS: Yes, that's a very good point. It is true that in the Seychelles, it's a pretty much steady diet. In the Faroes, [] they get the whale periodically. But methy l merc ury has a relatively long half-life in blood. So what happens is if you measure their blood levels of the methy l merc ury in the Faroes, it doesn't go up with a whale feast, and then down and stay down, and then up with a whale feast, and then down . It stays pretty high all the time because of the long half-life of the methy l merc ury in the blood. Tr. 4 at 823. There was one study in pa rticular that Dr. Lucier had referred to for support of Petitioners' theory of ethyl-merc ury related cardiac arrest, which Dr. Brent saw as an unreliable outlier that addre ssed a disting [The Salonen s tudy ] is a study that has been cited because it reports that there is114 an association betwee n fish and merc ury intake, and myocardial infarc tion, which is a hea rt attac k. Now, it 's important to note that a -- there has bee n no alleg ation, as best as I saw in this case, by anybody that Thomas Kolakowski had a myocardial infarc tion. So it's kind of a differ ent end point. But that's what they did repor t in the Salonen study . ...One of the things y ou can tell about a study in terms of how w ell it's reg arded in the medical literature is how often people cite it.... And according to an Ovid databa se search, that Salonen study has not been cited once in the medical literature since it g ot published. Tr. 4 at 821- 22. Dr. Brent believed that there existed no support in the medical literature for the proposition that the ethyl merc ury in thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines could cause death from an adver se cardiac outcome: [T]here is, in terms of anything I can find, no credible scientific support for the proposition that thimerosal exposure from vaccines can cause death. I know this literature , I think, quite well. I have looked specific ally for anything that would support that position, and I could not come up with a single paper , with a single alleg ation, with a single suggestion anyplace in the medical literature to suggest that Neither Dr. Brent nor Respondent indicated where in the record such an article was to be found.114 -100-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 100 of 177toxicity from thimerosal in vaccines, in the doses you get from vaccines, is likely to cause adver se ca rdiac effects, c ardia c arrest, dea th. And as a matter of fact, I went throug h all the studies that were cited and talked about by the Petitioners to see if they had anything that made that alleg ation. And none of it, none of the studies did. What they did is they relied on a couple of publications, primarily the Dahha n publication, which is very, very high exposure; the Cinca publication, which is very, very high exposure; and the Grandjean paper , which actua lly doesn't really refer to cardiac toxicity, and is a study from the Faroe Islands. Tr. 4 at 822- 23. Dr. Brent went into greater detail conce rning the Dahha n article , which \"dealt with one of115 sever al Iraqi episodes of poisoning by fungicides that were put on seed grain,\" a fungicide to as EMPTS\" (ethyl mercury paratoluene sulfanilate) . Tr. 4 at 824. First he noted that, \"EMPTS is differ ent from ethyl merc ury. It has some simil arities to it, obviously ... the differ ences betwee n EMPTS and ethyl merc ury have never been systemically studied.\" Id. The Dahha n study studied the electroca rdiog rams of 42 people with poisonous levels of merc ury toxicity (some of whom died). Id. Dr. Brent descr ibed the results and the conclusions that can be draw n from them: [I]f you look at the effects, they were rathe r varie d and inconsistent. And they were not very specific . Anybody who t akes care of a lot of very acute ly ill patients, and these patients were certainly potentially acute ly ill, knows that as you keep them on cardiac monitors during their illness, their EKGs are going to show a lot of non-specific chang es. They 're going to show a lot of chang es in the so-cal led QT interval and the S T segment, and so on. And t here was no real specific ity of these chang es. There was nothing really specific about them that said ah-ha, this is a pattern you only see in merc ury poisoning. Rather, what it seeme d to Dahha n is sort of very non-spec ific chang es that people see all the time, if you were to, for example, walk into an intensive care unit at any hospital and look at the cardiac monitors. And it's unlikely that they actua lly represent the toxic effe ct of mer cury on the hea rt. Tr. 4 at 824-25. Dr. Brent stated that the same reasoning explains the results of a simil ar studies by Jalili, a pape r filed by Respondent, and Z hang , a pape r filed by Petitioner:116 117 Jalili explained exactly the same thing. He, in fact I believe it was Jalili who actua lly pointed out that most of the EKG chang es were actua lly due to low potassium levels. It's classica l, you see in acute ly ill patients, which cause s these kinds of EKG chang es. Pet. Ex. 18, Tab U, Shawkat S.

A That's c orrect. Tr. 4 at 826. Also on the subject of the Dahha n paper , Dr. Brent distinguished the very limit ed dose of ethyl merc ury in thimerosal- containing vacc ines from the nearly-lethal or lethal dos es of merc ury consumed by the Dahha n study 's subjects: I think here is a classic example of why, wher e dose is such an important distinction here. The doses in the EMPTS episode in Iraq were huge, and bear really no relationship, I mean, cannot be generalized to the tiny doses you get with a vaccine. EMPTS was 7.3 percent of the fungicide substance that was used in Iraq. The ethyl merc ury and the two doses of the hepatitis vaccine that Thomas Kolakowski got, as we were saying befor e, contained 0.005 percent of ethyl merc ury. So it was massively differ ent. In fact, if you look at the estim ates in the Dahhan paper, t hey believe that, they point out that about 35 milli grams of EMPT S per kilogr am was necessary to cause a lethal effect. Thirty -five milli grams per kilogr am. ...[T] here are 1,000 microg rams in a milli gram. So that's 35,000 microg rams per kilogr am of EMPTS, which, if you just look at the merc ury component, works out to 15,000 microg rams per kilogr am. Now, Thomas Kolakowski received in his two vaccines 5.3 microg rams per kilogram. There is a massive, massive differ ence in dose betwee n the two. So clearly you can't generalize the Dahha n paper to what happene d to Thomas Kolakowski. Tr. 4 at 826-27. Dr. Brent added on this last statement that he could not se e any relevance at all in relating the D ahhan pa per to the issue a t bar. Tr . 4 at 827. Next, Dr. Br ent addr essed the Cinca article , relied upon by Dr. L ucier :118 [I]n the three cases in which they measure d the blood levels, they measure d them in three out of the four individuals that were poisoned, the blood levels varie d from 1,000 to 5,000 microg rams per liter. Once again, reme mber, in the United States we tend to be under about 10 microg rams per liter; the maxi mum you typically get from a vaccine is well under 10 microg rams per liter. So this is a massive, massive exposure, compar ed to any thing that y ou could possibly get from a vacc ine. Pet. Ex. 18, Tab V, I. Cinca et al., Accidental ethyl mercury poisoning with nervous system, skeletal muscle,118 and myocardium injury, 43 JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY, NEUROSURGERY, AND PSYCHIATRY 143-49 (1979). Dr. Brent summarized the study thusly: The Cinca study is from Romania, and it reports four members of a family who [ate meat from a] hog [] accidentally poisoned with fungicide containing ethyl mercury chloride. And they, for reasons unbeknownst to me, ate the hog, and got themselves poisoned by ethyl mercury. Once again, this was an extremely high-dose exposure, as the data shows. Tr. 4 at 828. -102-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 102 of 177Tr. 4 at 828-29. The same study examined the merc ury levels of various body tissues, to assess the level of toxicity in the tissue or org an: [H]ere you have the tissue le vels in various tissues of merc ury. Kidney , as you see, has the most, and kidney avidly will, is the organ that takes up most of the ethyl merc ury. And what you can see, if you look all the way over on the right to the myocardium, that's the heart, you get relatively little into the heart compare d to the other tissues. Tr. 4 at 830. In sum, Dr. Brent did not find the study relevant to the issue at bar: \"I see no way that this kind of massive, massive exposure to ethyl merc ury could have any relationship to the kinds of doses y ou get in two hepatitis-B vacc ines.\" Id. The next article discussed by Dr. Brent was the Pfab case study , about the individual who119 attempted suicide by ingesting a thimerosal solution. He compar ed the merc ury levels of that individual to the mercury levels mea sured post-va ccina tion in infants: That solution contained five grams of thimerosal, five million microg rams -- five milli on microg rams. And as you see, his blood levels were also extremely high: 14,000 microg rams per liter. Now, there have been some studies wher e they have given vaccines to children, and assessed their blood level post-vacc ination. The Stajich study was one that ically at [the] Hepa titis-B vaccine. And120 the children got about 12.5 microg rams of merc ury in the form of thimerosal, just like Thomas Kolakowski got in his hepatitis-B vaccine. And as you can see, the peak blood level, what they measure d, was on the average, in the term infants, of 2.2 microg rams per liter. There has also been a discussion of the Pichichero paper from 2002, wher e they121 measure d blood levels in children who got vaccines. The doses varie d quite a bit, depending upon what vaccinations they were getting. It was up to 62.5 microg rams of merc ury at a time. And as you can see, the blood levels in Pichichero were post-vacc ination one to 1.6 microg rams per liter. Pichichero, by the way, published a second study . I don't know, I don't believe there's been any testimony on the second study ; it just came out in 2008 in the Journal of Pediatrics, wher e once again he looked at a gr eater group, a big ger group of va ccina ted children. They received up to 57.5 microg rams of merc ury in the form of thimerosal at any particula r vacci nation. And the highe st blood level obtained was a little under eight microg rams per liter. Resp.

And Thomas Kolakowski received two doses of hepatitis-B, and so it would be very simil ar to what was seen in Stajich. Stajich just studied the newbor n dose. But he probably would have develope d blood merc ury levels pretty simil ar to what Stajich's are in his term infants, be cause Thomas Kolakowski wa s a term infa nt. Tr. 4 at 831-32. It was in the contex t of discussing these studi es, an d the orders of magnitude of differ ence in dosag e betwe en the poisoning studies and the amount of thimerosa l in vaccine s, that Dr. Brent responde d to a point made by Dr. Shane-that \"precise dosag e levels don't apply in individuals with the toxic effects.\" Tr. 4 at 833, quoting Tr. 3 at 708. This statement makes no sense to Dr. B rent: How could Dr. Shane say that at .1 or .01 microg ram you could actua lly have an adver se effect? I have no idea how he could say that. There certainly is not any reliable scientific data, or any scientific data of any kind, reliable or unreliable , that could support such a preposter ous, fra nkly, asser tion. Tr. 4 at 833- 34. Next, Dr. Brent distinguished the measure ment of heart rate varia tion in the Grandjean study from the studies of subjec ts who had sustained he avy doses of mer cury: The 2004 Grandjean article ... was from the Faroe Islands study ... what they studied was something called heart rate varia tions.... They weren't actua lly studying the heart. Heart rate varia tion is not an effect on the heart, is not an effect of the heart. The heart is under great control of the nervous system, part of the nervous system called the autonomic ner vous system. Speeds it up, slows it down. And so what122 they were studying is the nervous system control of the he art. And the y found that at children who had very high prena tal methy l merc ury exposures in the Faroes, that they had decreased heart rate varia bility . Now, that's basica lly what they found. And it probably relates to an effect of the high levels of methy l merc ury on the brain cente rs that control that. There have not been, once again, any repor ts of any adver se cardiac effe cts in the population of the F aroe Islands. These c hildren, despite their very high blood merc ury levels, prena tally and postnatally , are not having cardiac arrests, are not having sudden ca rdiac death, they 're not having SIDS. Tr. 4 at 834- 35. Also aff ecting this question is latency in the onset of a dverse effect following a n exposure to merc ury. Dr. Brent used the latency interval to explain further that Thomas Kolakowski's death was not fr om mercur y toxicity from vac cination: The autonomic nervous system is \"the portion of the nervous system concerned with regulation of the activity122 of cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and glands; usually restricted to the two visceral efferent peripheral components, the sympathetic nervous system and nervous system.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 1841. 104 of 177There is [a latency period associate d with merc ury poiso ning], primarily with the organic merc urials.... For examp le, in the Iraqi EMPTS episode, the latency was anything from nine to 100 days befor e any symptoms occur red.... [In a study of Iraqi merc ury poisoning from grain with EMPTS,] there was a latent per iod of weeks to months after methy l merc ury exposure befor e the deve lopment of poisoning symptoms.... [In contra st,] Thomas Kolakowski had an unfortunate death, f ive day s after his last vaccination.... I mean, even if you look back at his first vaccination, which is basica lly five we eks, eve n that is a fair ly short latency . Tr. 4 at 836. For this reason, Dr. Brent noted his disag reement with Dr. Shane's statement that a person \"could die from merc ury toxicity within 24 hours of exposure.\" Tr. 4 at 837, citing Tr. 3 at 698-99. Besides perha ps by inhaling merc ury vapor, Dr. Brent did not think such an immediate toxic response would be possible, except in extremely high doses; he thought it entirely implausible that such could oc cur a t a lower dose. Tr. 4 at 837. Moreove r, Dr. B rent did not see a ny link between myocarditis and low-leve l merc ury exposure from vaccination, inasmuch as myocarditis often accompanies \"any acute sever e illness,\" and is not specific to acute merc ury toxicity, \"[a]lt houg h certainly , somebody who's sever ely merc ury-toxic can have a component of myocarditis.\" Tr. 4 at 837-38. Dr. Brent said the typical first (and at times only) manifest ation of mercury toxicity is paresthesia (numbness) in the extremiti es cause d by periphe ral neuropa thy, and that the Bakir study found t he threshold dose for such a sequela t o be 25-40mg (25,000-40,000 \u00ecg) of merc ury. Tr.123 4 at 838. That means that the first clinically manifest symptom recognized to be a sequel a of merc ury toxicity require s a dose, a dminist ered within a short span, of a t least 25,000 \u00ecg. Dr. Brent stated that, in the Burbache r study , methy l merc ury levels were higher in the124 brain than were those of ethyl merc ury following an equivalent dose for each, which contra dicted125 Dr. Lucier 's nega tion of that proposition. Tr. 4 at 839-40, referring to Tr. 1 at 233-34. Whil e conce ding that following exposure to a given dose of ethyl merc ury, the amount of metabolized inorg anic merc ury was slightly greater than it was following an equivalent dose of methy l merc ury, Dr. Brent stated that \"you get much less merc ury in the brain after equivalent doses of ethyl merc ury than y ou do from methy l merc ury.\" Tr. 4 at 841-42. \"So you get about roughly 107 at the end of the experiment for methy l merc ury, versus maybe 15 for the ethyl merc ury.\" Tr. 4 at 842. Dr. Brent See supra at note 108. 123 Pet. Ex. 18, Tab M, Thomas M. Burbacher et al., Comparison of Blood and Brain Mercury Levels in Infant124 Monkeys Exposed to Methylmercury or Vaccines Containing Thimerosal, 113 (8) ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES 1015-21 (August 2005). Dr. Brent was quick to point out that the dosage given the primate subjects in the Burbacher study contained125 more thimerosal than would be contained within a vaccine dose: [T]hey had to push the dose up because they were concerned that if they used the actual doses that were used in the vaccine, they wouldn't be able to detect the thimerosal in the brain. It might be too low. So they pushed it up to this higher dose. Tr. 4 at 840. -105-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 105 of 177also contra dicted Dr. Shane's claim that, at equivalent doses, ethyl merc ury exposure is more toxic than methy l merc ury, stating that the reason Dr. Shane could cite no medical literature source for this proposition is t hat none e xists. Tr. 4 at 843. Dr. Brent discussed the Magos study , which he viewed as \"proba bly the most relevant126 study that looked at that very question of which has more of an adver se effect at simil ar doses, ethyl merc ury or methy l merc ury.\" Tr. 4 at 843. Its purpose was \"to compar e total and inorg anic merc ury conce ntrations in selec ted tissues, including the brain, after the daily administration of methy l merc ury and ethyl merc ury, and to relate these finding s to damag e in the brain and the kidney .\" Tr. 4 at 843-44. The researchers conclude d that \"methy l merc ury was more toxic than ethyl merc ury at an equivalent dose,\" notwithstan ding the fact that \"ethy l merc ury-treated rats had more inorg anic merc ury in their brain than methy l merc ury ones ... because ethyl merc ury become s inorg anic faster than methy l merc ury does.\" Tr. 4 at 844. And Dr. Brent contra dicted Dr. Connor's statement that127 the Magos study followed an aberrant method to extract merc ury for measure ment, stating, \"He got that totally backw ards. The Magos method for merc ury analy sis is the well-a ccepted method used today all over the world.\" Tr. 4 at 845. 128 Next, Dr. Brent defended the (first) Pichichero study against Dr. Lucier 's earlier criticism that the first measure ments of blood merc ury taken in the study , occur ring three to five days post intramuscular injection of vac cine, we re too late to capture peak blood leve ls. Tr. 4 at 849-50. Pet. Ex. 18, Tab YY, L. Magos et al., The comparative toxicology of ethyl- and methylmercury, 57126 ARCHIVES OF TOXICOLOGY 260-267 (1985). Dr. Brent added:127 Now, I will say that ethyl mercury affects the kidneys a little bit more, because ethyl mercury possibly affects kidneys. But in terms of the brain, clearly methyl mercury caused more toxicity than ethyl mercury. There is no study that I know of in the scientific literature that shows the contrary. Tr. 4 at 845. Dr. Brent went into greater detail on why Dr. Magos was the world expert on this point, and why Dr. Connor128 was wrong to gainsay his method: Magos is basically a leader in this area. What Magos did, he developed this original method for the extraction of methyl mercury. And when he did this study, and he was studying the comparative amounts of methyl and ethyl mercury when he measured the amounts in the brain, he wanted to be sure that the technique for methyl mercury would also work well for ethyl mercury, because it's a different molecule. And what he found is he had to increase the stannous chloride concentration to be sure that he got a full extraction of ethyl mercury, so it was a valid determination that he got all the ethyl mercury out. And that's what he did. He modified his technique so it would work, specifically so it would work well for ethyl mercury, as well as methyl mercury. So no, there was no flaw in the technique. That is the technique that is still, that is still used today. It was an enhancement of the technique, so it would work well in this experiment. Tr. 4 at 845-46. -106-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 106 of 177[T]hat makes the assumption, which is incorre ct, that the vaccine was given intravenously . If you administer the vaccine intravenously , you will get a peak level immediately at the time of admi nistration. Howeve r, vaccinations are given intramuscular ly, and they are there fore slow-re lease kinds of prepa rations. They slowly release from the muscle. So that it rea lly takes a day or two bef ore y ou get, before y ou start getting the peak levels from the vaccine. So you can't extrapolate back to the da y of vac cination. Probably the pea k levels ar e about two da ys later. And the other thing that Dr. Lucier failed to mention was that, in fact, the very issue about which he was developing this hypothetical model about the back- extrapolation to high leve ls, has been ve ry well studied by these same investiga tors. 129 ...[I]t takes about a day or so befor e the levels actua lly peak, because of the fact that it's an intramuscular injection. And the highe st, the highest blood level in any of these groups that was observe d in the study was less, was a little less than eight microg rams per liter. So that tells us that that's about what y ou can expect from a vaccination; something under about 8 microg rams per liter is what you would typically expect. And then as you can see, the levels fall, and by about 10 days or so they get ver y close to base line. Tr. 4 at 850-52. Dr. Brent agreed that \"the levels repor ted in Pichichero 2008 are approximately , are less than half the levels of the back calculations testified to by Dr. Lucier ,\" and that \"the blood-level measure ments ontaining vaccines\" are reliable . Tr. 4 at 852- 53. Next, Dr. Br ent spent some time contextualiz ing la boratory cell ser ies studies: It's important to reme mber that when you just have cells in a petri dish in the labora tory, that is very drama tically different from, a very drama tically differ ent environment from what y ou would see in the cells in an individual. Our cells, our bodies are highly regulated, metabolically regulated. We have all kinds of protec tive mecha nisms in our body for a ll kinds of insul ts. W e have profound sy stems in our body to keep it working correctly , to keep the c ells working correctly . And there 's a marke d interplay betwee n all these differ ent systems. That does not, that is not the case in a test tube. That is not the ca se in a pe tri dish. ...You can kill a cell in vitro with just about anything. If I just put it in an environment of water , it will die. Cells are very, very highly vulnera ble to chemica ls in vitro , because they don't have all the chemica l protec tive mecha nisms that we have in our body . So in general, when you put a chemical in the incubation media Dr. Brent mentioned one of these:129 [T]hey got a sample at what they call time-point-zero, which was just immediately before the vaccination, and then they got subsequent time reports starting as early as 12 hours post-vaccination. So that data doesn't require a back-extrapolation on some hypothetical models on the early Pichichero paper; the data is right there, in published form, by these same investigators in their follow-up study. Tr. 4 at 851-52. -107-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 107 of 177with cells, say, in a petri dish, those cells are going to be very, very sensitive to doses of those chemica ls that will have, that will be totally without effect in vivo, in a live person or an animal. ...We have metallothionein, we have glutathione, we have cysteine, we have various proteins. All of these, all of these bind and detoxi fy heavy metals, merc ury and other heavy metals. That doesn' t exist in a cell-c ulture environme nt. ...[E]ven that merc ury in the brain is 99.9 percent bound, highly bound by these molecules we were talking about: the glutathiones, the thials, the metallothioneins, all these metal-binding proteins and other substances in the brain that are there with the specific intention of detoxi fying against all the heavy metals that we come in contac t with. Because it's only when the metal is in the free form, not bound to something else, that it can interac t with cells. And once it gets bound by something else, the c ell is protected f rom it. Tr. 4 at 857-59. There fore, toxic effects observe d in a petri dish c annot be direc tly extrapolated to represent the same result or risk in a live human being . Tr. 4 at 857. The IOM has released a statement on the effect of merc ury on precisely that very point. Tr. 4 at 860. Neve rtheless, Dr. Brent stipulated that these sort of me chanistic studies ar e ver y helpful in the rig ht context: They are useful, if I know that there is some effect of a substance on a cell type in the body , and I want to study that mecha nism of effect, then what I would do is I would take that cell type and try to study it in vitro , because you can do more sophisticated studies on the cells. So they're good for sort of mecha nistic studies, but they do not have r eally a lot of validity in terms of tox icity studies. Tr. 4 at 860. This understanding about in vitro studies dovetailed into Dr. Brent's critique of Dr. Lucier 's relianc e on the \" Waly study \": The Waly paper really doesn't have anything to do with the heart. It really was desig ned to look at neur ologic al effects. And they used, t hey took a bunch of cells that are in vitro , and ther e are these things that a re called ce ll lines. ...And very often these cell lines, in order to keep growing , have to be tumor cell lines, because tumor cells grow in an unrestric ted fashion. And so he used a tumor cell line of neurona l cells, so-ca lled neurobla stoma type of tumor of neurona l cells. 130 And then he incubated them with thimerosal and a bunch of other things, as well, and they all had adverse effects on the cell ... and he was able to demonstrate adver se effects from rather small amounts of thimerosal on the cells. Now, what was interesting is that he could only make this happen if he did this in a copper-free medium. A neuroblastoma is \"a sarcoma consisting of malignant neuroblasts, usually arising in the autonomic nervous130 system (sympatheticoblastoma) or in the adrenal medulla; it is considered a type of neuroepithelial tumor and affects mostly infants and children up to 10 years of age.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 1253. -108-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Page 108 of 177...Our cells are highly depende nt on copper . We have large amounts of copper in our cells. And in fact, for some reason, Waly could only demonstrat e this in a copper -free medium. When he reconstitut ed the medium so that there was copper in the medium, the whole effect disappea red. So it was strictly an artifa ct of the fact that there was no copper in the medium. I mean, you wouldn't see this kind of effect in the body, because we have lots of copper in our bodies. I think that's a typical example about the kinds of limit ations of in vitro studies. So what he showed, when he did this in the copper-f ree environment , is that there is an enzy me in these cells called methionine synthase. And he was study ing the fact that thimer osal and all131 these other molecules that he added to the cells seemed to inhibit this enzyme, methionine sy nthase. And he tried to relate that to neurolog ical adver se effects. It was sort of an unfortunate cell line to choose, because, as Waly himself, and Deth, who was a senior collabora tor, ultimately point out is that the methionine synthase in this cell culture, this tum or ce ll culture line, is abnorma l; it's not a typical methioni ne sy nthase. S o we don' t even know if it applies to other ce lls. Tr. 4 at 861- 63. The rest of Dr. Brent's direc t testimony was spent refuting claims on the topic of toxicolog y made by Dr. Connor and Dr. and patholog ist, . Shane cited to acetaminophen as a classica l example in support of his contention that children have greater vulnera bility to toxicity than do adults, Dr. Brent disag reed. Tr. 4 at 864-65. Dr. Brent pointed out in the most recent edition of a book by Randall Baselt, mentioned by Dr. Shane in making his point, that \"no place in tha t section does it say anything about the fact that children are more sensitive to acetaminophen than adults.\" Tr. 4 at 865. He continued, \"As a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, children are marke dly less sensitive to acetaminophen toxicity than adults.\" Id. 132 Methionine is \"a naturally occurring essential amino acid furnishing both methyl groups and sulfur necessary131 for normal metabolism,\" this statement:132 Acetaminophen at very high doses, classical dose-related thing. You know, at therapeutic doses it's a good drug. At very high doses, it can cause liver toxicity. And adults, in adults it's one of the most common causes of liver failure, very, very high doses of acetaminophen. Usually overdoses. ...[T]he most common reason for admission, emergency admission to my service is an acetaminophen overdose. There is not a single case in the medical literature of a child who has taken a single overdose of acetaminophen -- and they do it, because they're toddlers, and they, you know, they find things and they have a lot of hand-to-mouth behavior, and sometimes they take a lot. There's not a single case ever in the medical literature of a toddler who has taken a single overdose of acetaminophen that have ever had any toxicity. So when Dr. Shane says that they are -- a great example of how small children are more sensitive, he's absolutely got it backwards. They're clearly less sensitive. And this reference that he cited says nothing at all about them being more sensitive. Now, if you look at another what I consider to be a well-regarded toxicology text, which is my book ... I didn't write the acetaminophen chapter. And here we have the chapter on acetaminophen. And -109-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 109 of 177Another statement Dr. Shane had made was that Thomas Kolakowski manifested \"signs of heart failure from mercury toxicity\"-to wit: \"GI gas, dec reased appe tite, a hea d cold, and a rash.\" Tr. 4 at 869. Dr. Brent counter ed, \"The se are the kinds of things that we see in children all the time. They 're very non-spec ific.\" Tr. 4 at 870. Those symptoms may be prese nt in the event of merc ury toxicity, \"[b]ut the y wouldn't have anything to do with the mercur y toxicity.\" Id. They \"could be indicia for ma ny, many things, but that would not include mer cury toxicity.\" Id. Dr. Connor had raised the specte r of \"an immunological reaction causing sudden cardiac arrest from a thimerosal-c ontaining vaccine,\" but Dr. Brent responde d that \"nothing like that has ever been repor ted [or] discussed. I have no idea wher e he came up with that.\" Tr. 4 at 870. He explained why such a the ory was so implausible: Thimerosal has never been shown to do anything like that. And in fact, when you think about it, think about the components of the vaccine. Components of a vaccine is desig ned to create an immunological reaction. If there was going to be a reaction, an abnormal reaction to anything, it would be to the major antig en in the vaccine, which is hepatitis-B antig en. I have no idea how he could have implicated the thime rosal. There's no evidenc e that this has ever happene d in the history of thimerosal usag e. Tr. 4 at 871. On a slightly simil ar note, Dr. Brent conce ded that one \"can be allerg ic to thimerosal,\" but saw \"no evidenc e that that was the case. And t here's never been a thimerosal allerg y causing cardiac a rrest.\" Tr. 4 a t 872. Summating his direc t testimony , Dr. Brent negated valid evidenc e [existed] ontaining can cause sudden arres or had \"caused Thomas Kolakowski's de ath.\" cr oss-examination from Petiti oners, Dr . Brent stipulated that the amount of mer cury in the environment is constant, and does not decay, and that \"if a person happens to be in an133 environment wher e there is more prese nt, then they will have a highe r exposure.\" Tr. 4 at 873-74. Howeve r, Dr. Brent disag reed that this meant \"appr oximately eight percent of the population from the NHANES study already are at toxic levels of merc ury;\" that study indicated that such a f igure represente d the population who had exceede d the EPA reference dose. Tr. 4 at 874. He added that the reference dose was not even based on adult populations, but upon the most vulnera ble I draw your attention to this particular passage. \"Children younger than six years appear to be more resistant to acetaminophen toxicity than adults and adolescents. Several large studies of young children have demonstrated that in this age group, a single injection of 200 milligrams per kilogram or less is highly unlikely to cause significant toxicity.\" And if you look at the sentence right above it, you can see that 150 milligrams per kilogram is the threshold for toxicity in adults. So they're clearly not more sensitive to acetaminophen. Tr. 4 at 865-868. Cf. nuclear fission, fusion.133 -110-Case Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 110 of 177population-unborn children-e ven though it is the reference dose applied to all population groups as a pre caution. Tr. 4 a t 875. Petitioners referenced the Stajich article to challeng e Dr. Brent that prema turely -born children e xceeded the EPA re ference n they received their vacc inations; he replied: [F]or the peak after the vaccination, absolutely . But remember , the EP A refer ence dose does not talk about peak levels, it talks about average levels. And of course , the vaccine levels, as we saw, and we were looking at them, go up and come back down. So yes, on the day that they're vaccinated, or in two days or three days after they're vaccinated, they are, you know, roughly 7.4, a little highe r, a little lower. B ut then it comes back down. There is nothing wrong with that. You would not certainly expect any adver se effect. And in fact, if you average it over time, they don't exceed the re ference level. Tr. 4 at 878- 79. Petitioners challeng ed Dr . Brent on that explanation in the following e xchang e: Q Well, Doctor, if you take y our ex ample that wa y, you could ac tually have a toxic dose one day, but if you average it out over a lifetime, you're fine. Isn't that -- A Well, well. But that I would say, yeah, I think that's a valid point, Ms. Chin-Caplan. But you have to realize that that's taking it to a bit of an absurd extreme. That's just not the way the reference dose was conce ived of. They weren't thinking in terms of what happens if you're chug ging along under the reference dose, and then all of a sudden you have this massive exposure: you fall into a vat of merc ury, and then they pull y ou out, and y our leve ls ultimately come back down. I mean sure, you can get merc ury-toxic from that exposu re. That's not the kind of thing that the r eference dose is obviously intended to addr ess. ... Q So at the time that these infants in Pichichero 2008 received their immuniz ations, they were already above the reference dose for EPA for at least that period of time, is that true? A Well, that's an incorre ct application of the reference dose. But most of them were not. Most of them were not, if you look at them. The highe st one was less than, it was a litt le less than eig ht. It might be one or two that were over 5.8. But that's not the way you apply a reference dose. Tr. 4 at 886- 87. Following that discussion, Petitioners mentioned certain rat studies wher ein infant rats retained merc ury in their bloodstream without excreting it, appar ently to argue for extrapolation to human childre n. Tr. 4 at 887- 892. Dr. B rent re sponded to this line of questioning a s follows: This is all based on the fact that the rat biliary system is very, very immature compar ed to the human biliary system at birth. And at birth, humans have a very well-func tioning biliary system; and as a matter of fact, it has been well -111-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 111 of 177demonstrated, by Pichichero and by others, that there is a very active excretion throug h the biliary system of merc ury from vac cines. Tr. 4 at 892. Another point of contention arose betwee n Petitioners and Dr. Brent conce rning the ndent \"susce ptibili ty factors\" listed by Dr. Lucier ; Dr. Brent characterized it as \"a construct that Dr. Lucier came up with.\" Tr. 4 at 905. As to whether age is a susceptibility factor, Dr. Brent stated that \"[p]renatal versus postnatal is a major susceptibility factor,\" but he did not think sex was \"particularly a major one.\" Tr. 4 at 906. He added that no \"genetic differ ence calculation\" had eve r bee n deter mined. Id. He did not believe that cer tain people \"are more susceptible to the effects of merc ury than others.\" Id. He stated that the population distribution for \"differences in clearance rate\" f it a bell curve distribution. Id. He did not believe that existing high body burden of merc ury affected how susceptible a person would be to a certain dosag e of merc ury relative to someone who had a lower body burden. Tr. 4 at 906-07. He also did not think that a neurotoxin had been identified that, if prese nt in the body , would make a person more susceptible to merc ury toxicity, in the event of a concur rent merc ury exposure. Tr. 4 at 907. At this, Petitioners mentioned PCBs, but Dr. Brent stated, \"we don't know if they influence each other, or if they're just simply added to the effect. PCBs don't necessary worsen the merc ury effect, they just add to it.\" Id. Lastly, he stated that any attempt to link diet as a suscept ibilit y factor is completely specula tive, and no scientific testing has bee n perf ormed to isolate this possibil ity. Tr. 4 at 909. 2Dr. Brent conce ded that, \"in sufficie nt doses,\" merc uric merc ury (Hg) can damag e the brain, but made ver y clear that the loca tion and extent of the damag es wa s dose-spec ific: [W]e're talking about specific doses. And it can harm differ ent ... types of cells. And a lot of the damag e that occur s when you get to ve ry high doses tends to affect specific parts of the brain, mostly in the back of the brain, called the cerebellum, the calpe rene corte x, and spec ifically the g ranula r layer of the ce rebellum. ...That's the most vulnera ble area. Now, as you get to higher and higher doses, I mean when you're talking about massive, massive, massive exposure, of course you can g et spillover damag e into other a reas. Tr. 4 at 913-14. He added that (inorg anic) merc uric merc ury does not cross the blood-brain barrier once it is in that inorg anic f orm, \"[o] r, if it does, it does ver y, very minimally .\" Tr. 4 a t 914. Later, Petitioners challeng ed Dr. Brent with one of the Charleston studies filed by134 Respondent, which monkey s were chronic ally exposed to methy l merc ury, but did not exhibi t symptoms: [I]n fact, if y ou look, do y ou know what that e xposure wa s? It was 50 microg rams per kilogr am per day, which is ... a massive exposure. I think it was 50, I might have Resp. Ex. A, Tab 15, Jay S. Charleston et al., Changes in the Number of Astrocytes and Microglia in the134 17 (1996). -112-Case 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 112 of 177that number wrong if you show me the article. I reme mber it was a very large -- it might have been 500 microg rams per kilogram per day, .5 milli grams per day. Massive exposure. The blood levels, the blood levels in those monkey s, Ms. Chin-Caplan, were approximately 1,000 microg rams per liter. A thousand microg rams per liter. Now, the monkey s themselves showed no clinical adver se effects, but this was a big , big e xposure. Tr. 4 at 915-16. The article's author, said Dr. Bre nt, concluded tha t it was only \"at those kinds of very high doses, which are huge doses, that you can have adver se effects on brain function.\" Tr. 4 at 916. Dr. Brent conce ded that, \"at massive doses,\" inorg anic merc ury exposure resulted in microg lia activation, but thought the study 's results proved that, most likely , \"that's probably why135 the animals were clinically fine, because the microg lia were activate d as a protec tive mecha nism.\" Tr. 4 at 917. Dr. Brent stipulated that, indeed, at a high enoug h exposure, \"that compensatory mechanism [could] be overw helmed,\" but added that the same could be said \"no matter what the chemica l substance is,\" it might \"push a person or an animal to the point whe re you've overloa ded their compensa tory pendent toxicolog y.\" Id. Later still, the questioning moved into the contra st betwee n the Seychelles and Faroe Islands data, and the relative utilit y of the studies in draw ing scientific conclusions. Petitioners challeng ed Dr. Brent with Dr. Lucier 's reasoning that \"whe n you have two well-done studies, one which has a positive effect and one which has a negative effect, that you should, prudenc e would dictate that you follo w what's recommended, follow the results of the positive study .\" Tr. 4 at 931. Dr. Brent qualified that such an approa ch may be burea ucratically preferable, but that it was not a scientifica lly valid approa ch to the question now fa cing the Court here : the question of ac tual causa tion: I think what y ou have to do is, first of all, do everything you can to try to see if you can tell wher e the differ ence is, and the major differ ence betwee n the two is the PCB exposures in the Faroe Island study . And second ly, ... [if] I was study ing a new antibiotic, and I did two studies; and one was a positive study that the antibiotic works g reat to treat pneumonia, and one was a neg ative study , the antibiotic didn't work to treat pneumonia, I wouldn't say well, prudenc e dictates that I accept the positive study, and ignor e the fact that one of my studies showed it didn't work ... and therefor e assume that it does work, and give this antibiotic to people. I would reach just the opposite conclusion. I would say no. You know, at this point we have two conflicting studies; we don't know what the true a nswer is, but we can't reach conclusions about it. Dr. Brent had previously described microglia thusly:135 Microglia are cells that kind of act as what we call phagocytes. They are cells that if there are bacteria in the brain, or debris, or something that shouldn't be there, they kind of gobble it up and digest it, and get rid of it. Tr. 4 at 915. -113-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 113 of 177Now, if I were in Dr. Lucier 's position, and I were a regula tor, then regulators, reme mber, alway s take the most conser vative position. That's their job. That's what they're supposed to do. I'm not criticizing for that. And so if you have one positive study and one negative study , then what you have to do is you make the assumption that what was in the positive study may be true. And you build your regulatory guidelines around that. For example, the EP A, when it came up with its reference dose, had to use Faroes. They couldn't use Seychelles, because there was no adver se effect in Seychelles. So there was no effect from which you can say here is the level where we see an abnorma l effect, and then we put in our uncer tainty factors.... I mean, that's what you do when you're a regulator. But that doesn't, that's differ ent than say ing y ou're trying to de termine scie ntific truth. ...And you cannot make assumptions by saying well, we have a study that shows an effect, and a study that doesn't show effect; so I'm going to say scientific truth is there 's an effect... I would fail terribly in my job as a scientist if I took that position. Tr. 4 at 931- 34. From there , Petitioners' cross-e xamination of Dr. Brent moved to their theory of a causa tive link betwee n ethyl merc ury exposure and adver se cardiac effects, and his stated opinion that cardiac irregularity in those people was a non-spec ific symptom of failing health due to acute , sever e toxicity, and nothing specific to mercur y in particular : Q ...[T] he document by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, page 106 has c ardiova scular e ffects of inorg talk about a 22-year-old who attempted suicide by ingesting approximately 20 milli grams of merc ury per kilogr am as merc uric chloride. And he indicated that an EKG showed no P-wave , prolong ation of the QRS, and a high T-wa ve. That's a cardiac effect, isn't it? A Right. And I'm sure that was a cardiac effect of the fact that he was acute ly ill. Yes. ... Q What is i t about the ac ute illness that would lead to ca rdiac side eff ects? A Oh, it's just a characteristic. If you look, for example, at Dahha n, and you look, for example, at Jalili, you look at those EKG chang es, they're very non-spec ific chang es. And I note every day when I'm on service , which is now i t's about eight days a month, nine days a month, if I walk into the ICU and look at the rhythm strips, you see these s ame chang es on every acute ly ill patient. They 're very non-spec ific that's just, that's just som ething that y ou ty pically see in a cutely ill patients. Q Well, it says no P-wave ... And if they see no P-wave , isn't that an indication there 's no atria l contrac tion? A No, there could be atrial contra ction. It shows there 's no, it's not AV node-stimulated. For example, if you look in patients that have atrial fibrillation, -114-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 114 of 177they're having contra ctions, but there are just lots of them and miscoordinated in the atrium. And you won't see any P-wave s because they're not, the atrial beats are not beginning a t the SA node. Q What about prolong ed QTs? A Totally non-spec ific finding . I would say if you take my ICU patients, 50 to 60 perc ent of them ha ve prolong ed QT inter vals. Q Any dang ers associated with prolong ed QTs? A Depe nds on how long . Q And when you say it depends on how long, what's the dang er with the length of time? A Well, the QT interval refers to the relaxation of the ventricle s, the depolar ization -- the repola rization of the ventricle s, causing relaxation. And if you have a prolong ed QT interval, which now, a typical QT interval is about 400, 450 milli seconds. If it gets above about 550 or 600 milli seconds, you are at risk for a type of cardiac arrhythmia that we call torsades de pointes . And so we don't like136 it to get that long, because it does put people at risk. But, you know, you do see, you do see eleva tions into the high 400s and 500s all the time. I even see them on outpatient EKGs quite a bit. Q So the dang ers of prolong ed QTs a re sudde n car diac a rrest? A Only if it is, only if it is very prolong ed, and it's a torsades de pointes type of arrest. Tr. 4 at 939-41. When querie d, Dr. Brent pointed out a passag e within another study raised in challeng e by Petitioners: \"The re are no demonstrable cardiac chang es in mild cases. Modera te and sever e cases had tachy cardia, occasional arrhythmias, and two cases had a modera te rise in blood pressure .\" Tr. 4 at 943. Petitioners also raised the Jalili article 's mention of \"cardiac involvement\" regarding cases wher e individuals expressed an irregular pulse or EKG chang sion\"). Tr. 4 a t 945. Petitioners next raised the Dahha n article for c omparison with the pre ceding studies: Q And Doctor, when you look at this article , are the cardiac abnorma lities noted here any differ ent from the e arlier article s which we looked at? A Exactly the same pa ttern, a ve ry non-spec ific patter n. Torsades de pointes (from the French for \"fringe of pointed tips\") is \"an atypical rapid ventricular136 tachycardia with periodic waxing and waning of amplitude of the QRS complexes on the electrocardiogram as well as rotation of the complexes about the isoelectric line; it may be self-limited or may fibrillation. DORLAND'S, supra, at 1924. -115-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ 11/23/10 Page 115 of 177Q Okay . And Doctor, when you look at page 183 of this article , does it say that all fata lities from mercur y poisoning show a prolong ed QT inter val? In the EKG. A Prolonga tion of the QT interva l, all fatalities in the merc ury -- yes. Q So in thi s author's mind, a pr olonge d QT interva l was a pr oblem. A Well, he didn't say the prolonged QT interval caused it. That was what he observe d, that in the fatal cases the QT interval was prolong ed, which is not surprising . You know, the sicke r you are , the more likely you are to prolong ed QT intervals. Tr. 4 at 946. Shortly there after, Dr. Brent distanced the EKG effects from the ethyl mercury as a cause : I think it was Zhang who actually pointed out that most of the EKG chang es were actua lly related to hypokalemia, to a low potassium level, which is very common in very sick patients. And he descr ibes -- you asked me what the EKG chang es were? Was that your question? Yeah, they're descr ibed up on the top of page 253. It said seven patients showed EKG abnorma lities, also prolong ed QT interval, five showing depre ssion of the ST segment, flat or inverted T wave s and large U wave s, consistent with low serum potassium levels. After potassium supplementation, most values returne d to normal or nea rly normal leve ls. Tr. 4 at 947. When Petitioners suggested that a subject in the Cinca study , who had been merc ury poisoned, had \" died from c ardia c arrest,\" it led to the f ollowing inter chang e: A Well, that's not -- let me point something out. You cannot, it's a meaning less statement to say that somebody dies from cardiac arrest, because everybody dies from cardiac arrest. That's usually how you define death. No matter what's happene d to you, when your heart stops is when you define death. So for example, you cannot list on the death certificate cardia c arrest as the cause of death. That i s not considere d to be a valid cause of death. Every body dies of cardiac arrest. So the question is, you know, what c aused the cardiac a rrest. Q Okay . So Doctor, wha t cause d the ca rdiac arrest in these two childre n? A They were mer cury-toxic. Q And in these c hildren, they had EKG abnorma lities? A Oh, I'm sure they did. With blood levels from 1,000 to 5,000 microg rams per liter, you're going to be pretty darn sick. And when you're that sick, you're going to have E KG cha nges, no question. ...And I think it's probably fair to say that anybody with a blood merc ury level of 1,000 to 5,000 microg rams per liter, who ends up this sick and in a hospital, is going to probably have some non-spec ific EKG c hang es. Absolutely . -116-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 116 of 4 at 951-953. Moreove r, h the Cinca study 's author(s) stated \"that ethyl merc ury poisoning seems to [cause] cardiac altera tions more than methy l merc ury poisoning,\" Dr. Brent \"went back throug h all their references to try to verify wher e that came from, and [] could not verify that ... there is nothing in the literatur e that ac tually supports that statement.\" Tr . 4 at 954-55. He compar ed the Cinca study to the others discussed, saying, \"[I]n all these cases, wher e there is a very massive exposure to merc ury, to the point that it makes you very ill, you will definitely see some non-spec ific chang es on the EKG. And that's true of any very ill patient, for any reason.\" Tr. 4 at 954. Discussing yet another article shortly there after, when asked to discuss \"the [cardiolog ic] signific ance of a prolong ed, a prolong ed evoked potential latency ,\" Dr. Brent replied that there was none. Tr. 4 at 957-58. Also, addre ssing the observa tion of decreased R-to-R variation that occur s in patients with high pre natal exposure to me thyl mercury, Dr. Brent stated that \"it does show that the methy l merc ury, at those very high levels, is having some effect on the brainstem ... it's a highe r level than people should normally be exposed to. But ... you don't see any [actual clinical manifestations]. Tr. 4 at 962-63. There was during cross-e xamination, y et another discussion of the B urbac her a rticle: Q Does e thyl mercur y get into the brain fa ster? A Ethyl merc ury gets into the brain slightly faster , but accumulates in the brain much less. I t goe s out faster. Q Okay . Now, y ou're talking a bout the org anic spe cies, anic mer cury, the Hg that we discusse d ear lier. A Right. 2Q In Hg from ethyl merc ury, was there a highe r level in the brain from ethyl merc ury than there was fr om methy l mercur y? A ... So if you look at the inorga nic m ercury for thim erosa l, at the end of that time period, it's a little over 10. It's a little over 10, maybe 12, 13, 14 parts per billion. And it stays pretty const antly at that. And that's about the amount of inorg anic merc ury. If you look at the methy l merc ury, it's a little lower. The inorg anic mer cury is a little lower . It's about may be seve n, and that's a bout where it is. Now, what's important to notice is, howeve r, at the end of the experimental period all of the, if you go back to the thimerosal on the right, all of the ethyl merc ury is just about gone. There 's a little bit left there , maybe two parts, maybe two to three parts per billion. It's just about gone. If you look at the methy l merc ury, there 's still over 100, or let's say 100, parts per billion left there . So the total merc ury for thimerosal i s about 12, 13; total mercur y for methy l mercur y is about 107, maybe. And what's going to happen is, Ms. Chin-Caplan, is that the methy l merc ury gets the, get demethy lated a lot slower than the ethyl merc ury gets deethy lated. So over time what happens is all the methy l mercury will eventua lly become inorg anic merc ury. -117-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 117 of 177And so in the long run, not only will you have more total merc ury, as you have here at the end of the experiment, in the long run you'll end up with much more inorg anic merc ury from the methy l mercur y. Tr. 4 at 968- 970. Finally , Dr. B rent c larified a nd honed ce rtain aspe cts of his opinion on redire ct: Q Dr. Brent, there was a lot of discussion on your cross-e xamination about the Seychelles and the Faroes, and whether fish is benef icial for neurolog ical outcomes, or whether the Faroes a subtle neurolog ical defic it. Although interesting , do either of those studies, are they relevant to what the question is today ? Does it cause cardiac arrest in children, or sudden cardiac arrest in infants? Do any of those studies cover that as an outc ome? A No, no. They weren't looki ng at that. They were totally silent with regard to the issue of ca rdiac arrest or any thing like that. ...And they have never , despite the very high merc ury exposures, they have never repor ted that there's any incre ased incidence of cardiac arrest or sudden childhood death or anything like that. ...Q And Doctor, I know you testified on your direc t, and probably on your cross again, what is the relevance of the Z hang , the J alili, the Cinca, and Da hhan ar ticles regarding the EKG a bnormalities in this specific ca se? A Yeah. You can't - those are massive exposures. Those are poisonings, mass poisonings.... And they've got no relationship whatsoeve r to the very tiny exposures that you see from the vaccines. And the EKG abnorma lities were really, you know, they were the abnorma lities of sick people. These were very sick people. They were merc ury-poisoned people; they were very ill. And you do see these kinds of EKG abnorma lities, it 's just one of those thing s. Q And do those EKGs have any relevance to, specific ally to the finding s for Thomas Kolakowski? A No, absolutely not. You know, the doses in those were so huge that they didn't, that they were nothing at all like what Thomas Kolakowski got. Thomas Kolakowski got doses that are simil ar to what all children get, and there 's never been a repor t of any alleg ation of cardiac arrest from the doses you get from vaccines. And in fact, if you look at Thomas Kolakowski's rhythm strips in the emer gency depar tment when they were attempting to resusc itate him, they were just, you know, even the Petitioner's cardiologist said they were just completely non-spec ific and you couldn't dra w any conclusions from them. Q And finally , you testified earlier that there is no reference dose for ethyl merc ury, is that corre ct? A There is no refe rence dose f or ethy l mercur y. -118-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 118 of 177Q And when we talk about exceeding the reference dose throug h thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines, we're referr ing to the reference dose for methy l merc ury, is that corre ct? A That is absolutely correct. Q And in your opinion, is there any applicability of the reference dose for methy l mercur y to ethy l mercur y? A No, no. If anybody was really conce rned, they could do their own analy sis for ethyl merc ury and come up with a reference dose. But since most people' s exposures to ethyl merc ury are so tiny, I don't think anybody is ever going to bother to do that. Tr. 4 at 979- 82. His concluding rema rks ca me at the pr ompting of the Court: I would say only that, you know, there has been a lot of discussion here today about a lot of issues that have taken us, I think, very, very far afield from the question of whether thimerosal in a vaccine can induce ca rdiac arrest in a child. And that, y ou know, we've covere d all this ground. We've talked about all this stuff, and we've sort of gotten away from the fundame ntal question. And based on that fundame ntal question, though -- if we get away from the brain stuff and all the other stuff -- I think it just simply comes down to a question of dose , and the tiny dose that's associate d in vaccines. And there 's just absolutely no scientific support for the idea that it can cause cardiac a rrest. Tr. 4 at 989. 5. Richard Ring el, M.D. Dr. Ringe l is a pediatric cardiologist. Transc ript of Procee dings convene d on 25 June 2008 (Tr. 5) at 997. He attended SUNY Stony brook, and then Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New Y ork for medical school. Tr. 5 at 998. He completed his pedia tric internship and r esidenc y, as well as his pediatric cardiology fellowship, at the University of Mary land in Baltimore. Tr. 5 at 998. He started teaching there as well, moving from assistant profe ssor to full profe ssor over time. Tr. 5 at 998. He currently serve s as Direc tor of Pediatric Cardiac Catheterization and Adult Conge nital Heart Disease Catheterization at Johns Hopkins University Hospital, pursuant to which he sees approximately 20 patients a week, as well as \"attend[ing ] general pediatric cardiology clinics and inpatient service , ... some teaching responsibiliti es, and administrative responsibil ities for t he division.\" Tr. 5 at 998-999. As part of his work, he ha d been interpre ting EKGs for 25 years. Tr. 5 at 1002. Dr. Ring el is board- certified in pediatrics a nd pediatric cardiology . Tr. 5 at 998. Dr. Ringe l began his opinion testimony by corroborating generally Respondent's position that dosag e is the most important factor in assessing toxicity: Q And when you presc ribe medications, is the dose of the medication important? -119-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 119 of 177A It's very important. In infants and children, the dose of medications has to be weig ht-based.... [I]f you don't choose the adequa te dos e, you can not give enoug h of a medication based on a child's weig ht, and the medication can be ineffe ctive. And of course , if you then give too much of the medica tion based on the child's weig ht, then the medication can be toxic. So you need to fall within the range of thera peutic dosing . Q So, Doctor, would you agree ... that when presc ribing medications, they can be conside red be nefic ial at one dose , but tox ic or fa tal at another dose? A Yes, of c ourse. Tr. 5 at 1006. Dr. Ringe l summarized Thomas Kolakowski's course based mostly on the medical records: Thomas was born as a full-term well child. The only thing that was recog nized or noted was that he was large for his dates, or LGA, large for gestational age. His mother had conce rns on the second day of life about jaundice. It was felt that the jaundice represente d the fairly typical or ubiquitous neonata l jaundice, and there were recommendations given to expose to sunlight, and to keep well hydrate d. There was an examination a few days later, confirming the diagnosis of mild jaundice. The weig ht was found to be eight pounds, six ounces, a good weig ht for the infant. And some additional supplement of formula was recommended to make sure that the infant remained well hydrate d, one of the ways to clear jaundice from the system. There was some conce rn or mention of tremors. There is not any record of these tremors in the medical record. There is the mention of the jaundice by the pediatric ian, but nothing about the tremors. By the next weig ht check on December 24, the weig ht had already incre ased to eight pounds, 13 ounces, which is really quite good for a n infant. There was an examination on Januar y 2. Appar ently he was found to be growing and gaining weig ht well. The examination was noted as normal, without any abnorma lities identified by the pediatric ian, except for a mild eye discharg e. And the second hepatitis-B vaccine was given on Januar y 20. There 's nothing else in the medical recor d about t hat. My understanding is that four day s later, on the 24t h of Januar y, I think I have that date right, T homas awoke around 3:00 a.m. His mother broug ht him to the bed to feed him, and then Thomas stayed with Mother and Father in bed. And when she awoke at around 7:00, 7:15 in the morning , she found that Thomas was not breathing. There was some blood in the mouth, nose, I believe some on the sheets. His fathe r attempted or performed CPR , and emer gency medical service s were contac ted. ... My recollection is that the emer gency medical technicia ns arrived on the scene ; they found Thomas to be, I think they used the word \"lifele ss,\" but of course I can read the record. They found no spontaneous activity . They proce eded w ith CPR, including -120-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 120 of 177intubation in the field. They admini stered the first doses of epinephr ine via the intratrac heal tube, and they did not obtain intravenous access, and broug ht him to the emer gency room. I believe they did obtain an electroca rdiog ram so-ca lled rhythm strip, single le ad, which de monstrated asy stole, or no ca rdiac electrical a ctivity . Tr. 5 at 1008- 14. Narrowing in on the cardiologic matters within this history , Dr. Ringe l noted that, during his first few weeks of life, Thomas \"sounded as if he was a normal, healthy newbor n,\" and did not notice anything in the m edica l records s howing \"signs or symptoms of cardiac dysfunction after his first hepatitis-B vaccination.\" Tr. 5 at 1011. He also did not \"find any information in the medical records that indicated that Thomas Kolakowski was suffe ring any signs of cardiac dysfunction betwee n December 19, when he received his first vaccination, and Januar y 20, when he received his second vaccination[ , nor] betwee n Januar y 20, 1999, when he received his second hepatitis-B vaccination, and Januar y 25, 1999,\" when he died. Id. Dr. Connor stated that there was no evidenc e in the medical records of cong estive heart failure , and he disag reed with Dr. Shane's assessment that Thomas showed indica tions of cong estive hea rt failure . Tr. 5 at 1013. In looking at the emer gency records from 25 January 1999, Dr. Connor reiter ated the notations that Thomas was pulseless upon the EMTs' arrival, and showed some signs of lividit y, and that the rhythm strips from the EKG they took indica ted \"asystole, or lack of any cardiac electrical activity .\" Tr. 5 at 1014- 15. He de scribed the EKG rhy thm strips recorde d soon after their arrival, but before Thomas ar rived a t the hospital: In this, in this lead, descr ibed as LEAD II, which is a standard single lead used in emer gencie s, there is no evidenc e of cardiac electrical activity. There is some baseline motion, if you will, of the tracing. We c all that baseline noise, or artifa ct. You'll get that from any system wher e you hook up an electroca rdiog ram to something that has fluid or moisture. Also there is some, what someone might descr ibe as rhythmic motions in the second of the three tracings. This is all one continuous tracing that's been cut up, but in the second line. But the EMTs make sure to note that it's w ith CPR; so CPR is rhythmic, and that's why the artifa ct may appea r rhy thmic. Tr. 5 at 1015. Dr. Ringe l did not corroborate Dr. Shane's finding of pulseless electrical activity on those EKG strips, believing that they demonstrated \"total asystole,\" with \"no cardiac electrical activity \" at a ll. Tr. 5 at 1016. Dr. Ringe l recited the EMTs' clinical finding s as \"pulseless apneic modeling, lividit y, blood from the mouth, flaccid extremities, dilated non-rea ctive pupils, no obvious trauma,\" with a EKG reading of \"asystolic.\" Tr. 5 at 1017. He a dded, \"Lividity suggests that there has been inadequa te pumping of blood for a period of time, so that the bl ood that is in the vascular space has begun to settle out to the, what we call depende nt regions,\" meaning \"wha tever is the lowest point -121-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 121 of 177gravitationally .\" Tr. 5 at 1017-18. He was not able to ascertain with any particula rity or certainty137 when death would have occur red simply on the basis of a lividit y finding , except that it would take longe r than 15 minutes following death. Tr. 5 at 1018-19. This diagnosis was descr ibed \"pretty138 much t he same\" when Thomas arrived at the hos pital: \"Patient presents intubated, wit h in progress.\" Tr. 5 at 1019-20. At the hospital, the asystole was confirme d by a thre e-lead EKG . Tr. 5 at 1020. Dr. Ring el desc ribed the EK G reading s from the e merg ency room as follows: It's mostly noise. I do not see anything that looks like a standard electroca rdiog ram pattern. You can't pick out the so-called P wave s, you can't pick out regular QRS or the ventricula r elect rical activation or repola rization. It looks primarily like139 noise to me , perha ps related to ong oing CPR . We know that CPR was be ing given at this tim e. Tr. 5 at 1021. Dr. Ringe l could not delineate any of the wave segments of normal heart wave function fr om Thomas' rhy thm strips at the emerg ency room: Dr. Ringel later elaborated regarding the cardiologic significance of a lividity finding in this case:137 [L]ividity occurs when there is not enough blood being pumped around to keep the blood moving through the circulation. And then once the blood stops flowing through the circulation, the blood settles out. And as it settles out, it goes to the lowest areas gravitationally, and creates this kind of bluish hue, because the blood is pooling in the veins. The skin gets like a spongy feel to it, and the upper areas tend to look kind of pale or grayish. So the lividity, the way it looks, and again, it represents the cessation of any blood flow. And I repeat, I'm uncomfortable in being able to say how long it takes for that to occur, but I also have to say I'm not sure I understand the significance of the lividity if a child was found dead in bed, and whether the actual moment of death occurred 10 minutes before Mrs. Kolakowski woke up and found him, or 30 minutes before she woke up and found him. Tr. 5 at 1028-29. He stated the reason for his discomfort about setting a firm time frame as follows:138 I can't tell you how long it takes. I can tell you that I have seen children present to emergency rooms after being found by parents, and have demonstrated lividity. I can tell you that if we've had a child die in an ICU, and we wait for parents to come in or that sort of thing, they will start to begin to show lividity. But I can't pretend to say I know how long it takes. Tr. 5 at 1018. Dr. Ringel described in greater detail the wave segments of an EKG:139 The electrocardiogram pattern consists of a number of wave forms.... Atrial activation, or the electrical activation of the upper chambers of the heart, the atria, are described on the electrocardiogram by the P wave. Then there is the QRS complex, [which] represents the activation of the ventricles, or the pumping chambers. You then have a brief period of isoelectric, or lack of electrical charging. And then you have the T wave, which represents the repolarization or the recharging of the muscle cells of the ventricle becoming ready for the next electrical cycle. Tr. 5 at 1021-22. -122-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 122 of 177No. Again, you see something that someone might say is rhythmic. In other words, there are spikes that occur in fairly regular interval s. But they're not perfectly regular, like a heart rate. They also don't have the typical wave -form patterns. They have, espec ially in the second tracing from the top, you see a lot of very sharp spikes, which look more like 60-cy cle or electrical interfe rence, like a lead being loose and then causing this interfe rence, particularly in the m iddle of the second row. If you point to the middle of the second row -- yes, thank you -- you can see in betwee n each of those lar ge downwa rd def lections, there 's this noise in between. So this is a noisy record. It could possibly represent a coarse form of ventricular fibrillation, but I think it's more likely noise. If you don't mind, I refer you down to the bottom two tracings. Now, this is a pattern that some people would look a t and certainly say represents ventricula r fibrillation. Can you distinguish it completely from noise? No, you can't. You have to be cognizant of the clinical situation. I t's easy to create a pattern that looks like that just by tapping on an electroc ardiog ram or performing CPR , but if you just showed this to me, I would say this could be ventricula r fibrillation. Tr. 5 at 1022-23. A later EKG taken at the emerg ency room fit the profile of an agonal-or dying-he art rhy thm: Here you see what is often described as an agona l electroca rdiogram pattern. You don't have normally formed P wave s, the QRS patterns are often strang e or bizarre. And there may or may not be well-for med T wave s, and the rate is usually very slow. And one can think of it as the final gasps of a dying myocardium giving off some intrinsic electr ical ac tivity as the he art muscle die s. ...Ag ain y ou see a very slow rhythm. The heart rate, if you want to call it that, is in the twenties. You do see a QRS pattern. You do see , when the noise dies down in the backg round, you can see some vague T-wa ve patterns. Again, we would consider this to be, you know, an agonal EKG rhythm at a rate far below anything life-sustaining .140 Dr. Ringel described what he meant by \"agonal\" heart rhythm, and related it to what he saw on the hospital140 EKG strips in this case: As heart muscle is dying, there still remain[] some cells in the heart muscle, particularly the ventricles, that have the ability to depolarize, or discharge themselves, and repolarize, or charge themselves up again. Which is the process of how heart muscle becomes activated to contract. So not every bit of heart muscle dies simultaneously, so there can still be some muscle that has still retained some ability to electrically activate itself and deactivate itself. So that's what you see in an agonal rhythm, is the last remaining parts of the hearts dying. It is recognized that not all parts of the body die, if you will, at the same time. It's one of the tenets that leads to the possibility of harvesting organs for transplantation. So that even after a patient is dead, if you will, there are still useable organs, because they haven't completely \"died.\" So there are still living cells there. So this is just a reflection that there are some small patches of myocardium that can give off some electrical signal. There's nothing else you can say or do about it, as far as interpreting the -123-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 123 of 177Tr. 5 at 1024-25. Dr. Ringe l opined that none of these EKG readings \"woul d be indicative of a normal hea rt pattern.\" Tr. 5 at 1025. Regarding when Thomas Kolakowski actua lly died, Dr. Ringe l stated his opinion that \"whe n the EMTs arrived, I have no doubt that he was dead,\" adding \"Resuscitative efforts were unsucce ssful, and then he was decla red clinically dead, absolutely unresusc itatable and dead.\" Tr. 5 at 1025. Also, regarding the utility of Thomas Kolakowski's postmortem EKG readings in assessing the ca use of his dea th, Dr. Ringe l was dubious: Q What information c an you use from Thomas Kolakowski's, or can you use any information from Thomas Kolakowski's EKGs to provide information about his condition following r eceipt of his first hepatitis-B va ccine ? A No. These are essentially post-mortem electroca rdiog rams, and have no value in interpre tation of them in compar ison to the literature that Dr. Connor referred to. And I believe in Dr. Connor's testimony here, he also made that statement, that these electroca rdiog rams ar e irre levant. Q So is it your opinion, then, that the EKGs provide no information about Thomas Kolakowski's c ondition im mediately prior to his death? A They provide no infor mation. Tr. 5 at 1029- 30. The Court aske d a cla rifying que stion on thi s point: THE COURT: Doctor, ... was his cardiac arrest the cause of the proce ss tha t led to his death? Or was it part of the agonal proce ss, and the death, the cause of death was actua lly something e lse? If you can sa y. THE WITNESS: I see nothing in here that points to cardiac arrest as the, if you will, cause of dea th. THE COURT: Precipitating factor. THE WITNESS: Correc t. ... everyone in their field recognize that the heart stopping tends to be the end proce ss of many , many , many , many cause s of death. So there is electrocardiogram, because at this point in time the heart is already breaking, the heart muscle is breaking down. It has liberated all sorts of enzymes into the bloodstream and into the milieu of the heart muscle itself. If you check things like CPK levels or triponin levels, these are high; these are components of heart muscle cells that have begun to leak out from the leaky membranes or the dying membranes. The body tends to be filled with potassium by this point, because as heart muscles and regular muscles and skin tissues begin to die, they release potassium into the system. So the potassium levels become very elevated in a dying patient. Potassium levels wreak havoc on electrical signals. Acid buildup in the bloodstream, as the body is unable to discharge the acid any longer, that, too, wreaks havoc on electrical signals. So these are just signs of depolarization, but nothing interpretable when comparing it to normal electrocardiograms. Tr. 5 at 1026-27. -124-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 124 of 177nothing here that suggests that this child had an underly ing cardiac problem that would lead to cardiac arrest, which is a sudden cardiac death, which is what we prefer to call it; lead to a sudden cardiac death as the cause for the child's ultimate demise. But yes, ultimately the heart stopped. I don't like to use the term \"cardiac arrest,\" because I think in most of our minds that suggests that the cause of death was cardiac. ...[T] he heart had stopped beating some time befor e the EMTs arrived. They found absolutely no signs of cardiac function. They were able to resusc itate some minimal cardiac function, and appar ently only electrical function, as I have display ed, by doing the CPR and by giving epinephr ine. But they were never able to, even in the emer gency room, resusc itate enoug h of the heart to develop meaning ful heart function. Tr. 5 at 1031- 32. Dr. Ri ngel agr eed with most of Dr. Connor's assessment of the EKG strips, but disag reed strong ly with Dr. Shane' s fora y into EKG interpre tation: This is incorre ct. Unlike Dr. Connor's not ations, which are clearly marke d and you could see what we call a QRS pattern and T wave , there is no cardiac electrical activity here. This is backg round, baseline electrical noise, with perha ps some rhythmicity cause d by the ongoing CPR , which again is noted on the strips itself. There 's no ca rdiac electrical a ctivity here . Tr. 5 at 1034. Elsewhere Dr. Ringe l contra dicted another of Dr. Shane's labeling of EKG strips, noting that wher e Dr. Shane saw heart activity , Dr. Ringe l saw only \"noise\" and \"movement artifa Tr off, Dr. Ringe l addre ssed the medical literature touching on cardiologic sequela to merc ury toxicity and/or lethal poisoning. First, he distinguished the Dahhan article 's finding s141 from the EK G strips of Thomas Kolakow ski in the medical re cord: [A]t the time of the electroca rdiog rams, all of the patients were alive. None of them were in the proce ss of dying, althoug h a few of the patients did die subsequent to the obtaining of the elec troca rdiog rams. Tr. 5 at 1038. According ly, Dr. Ringe l saw \"no sign of correlation\" to compare the Dahha n article to Thomas Kolakowski's c ase. Tr . 5 at 1039. Moving on to the Cinca study, Dr. Ringe l summarized the article as \"mention[ing] the142 post-mortem cardiac finding s on ... two or three of the patients, that demonstrated a chroni c Pet.

Howeve r, when asked to compare the Dahhan and Cinca studies to a child who received two Hepa titis B vaccinations in the first month of life, Dr. Ringe l stated: Well, I think both papers are important descr iptive paper s of what happens when people get exposed to huge doses of organic merc ury, and the finding s that can be descr ibed, and the recovery of some patients and the demise of others. They do point to a number of interesting finding s. But from my readings and from my revie w, as I would revie w any article having to do with patients I care for, I don't see any sign of correlation betwe en these paper s and the Kolakowski case. They are just what we often say apples and orang es. These are, I don't see any reason to use these papers to signify what happene d to Thomas Kolakowski. Tr. 5 at 1039-40. Additionally , Dr. Ringe l did not find that any of the medical literature mentioned by Dr. Connor actua lly supported Dr. Connor's opinion that vaccines cause d or precipitated the death of Thomas Kola kowski via merc ury toxicity. Tr. 5 at 1041. Dr. Ringe l briefly addre ssed a claim made by Dr. Shane, that Thomas Kolakowski demonstrated symptoms of cong estive heart failure . First, he delineate d that the symptoms of cong estive heart failure \"are very differ ent betwee n adults and infants.\" Tr. 5 at 1040. For infants, symptoms \"deve lop[] gradua lly, but all over days to weeks,\" including \"incr eased respira tory effort, which either means rapid breathing and/or deep breathing.\" Id. He added, \"Another sign that parents might rec ognize would be g radua l decr ease, or an ina bility of fe eding or nursing ,\" lea ding to \"poor weig ht gain or no weig ht gain ... [b]ecause so much energy is being used in the proce ss of breathing and supporting the circulation, and the children are having decreased intake over the course of many days or weeks, that there is no longe r enoug h energy left for weig ht gain.\" Tr. 5 at 1041. Dr. Ringe l note d that he did not \"see anything in the medical records that indicated that Thomas143 had any of those sig ns or sy mptoms.\" Id. Dr. Ringe l conclude d his direc t testimony by considering potential alterna tive cause s for Thomas Kolakowski's de ath: Well, Thomas obviously died tragically and suddenly . The corone r used the term sudden death in an infant, or sudden infant death. I'm not going to, even though I used that in my descr iption in my statement, because that's what had been mentioned by the cor oner, I don't know that I would nece ssarily know that one would cla ssify it into a classic sudden infant death syndrome. That tends to be done by patholog ists. But what I can say is that there is an incre ased r isk of infants dy ing sudde nly when they share a bed with two adults, in the age group under 11 weeks, such that the Americ an Academy of Pediatrics has recommended against bed-sha ring in tha t age group. So the finding of an infant who had been previously well, being found dead in the bed with signs of blood from the mouth and nose, and the inability to See supra at 4.143 -126-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 126 of 177resusc itate, leads to the other possible conclusion that this was a child who did succumb to inadve rtent suffoc ation rela ted to Petitioners be gan cross-e xamination of Dr. Ringe l by asking him to compare the dosag e of ethyl merc ury in the two doses of Hepa titis B vaccine to the EPA reference dose for methy l merc ury: Q And do y ou know how much mer cury is contained withi n those hepa titis-B vaccines? A I believe those doses, and at that time it was 12 and a half microg rams ... [and] he we sents roug per kilogr am of body weig ht? A Yes. Q And that would be 30 times the re commended r eference dose f or EPA? Tr. 5 at 1045-46. Dr. Ringe l abstained from answe ring this question, as it related to toxicolog y, and not car diology . Tr. 5 at 1046- 1047. Dr. Ringe l did not dispute Dr. Connor's testimony , \"that prolong ed QT leave s an individual at risk for cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.\" Tr. 5 at 1050. Howeve r, he differ ed once again with Dr. Shane' s assessment of EK G reading s that focuse d on pulseless elec trical a ctivity (PEA): Some of the EKGs shown to me had no electrical activity. One or two may have shown, or one of the traces may have shown ventricula r defibrillation; that's not considere d PEA. And then there were the strips with the ag onal rhy thm. That is, I think, a step beyond pulseless electrical activity . That's basica lly the spasms of a dead he art. So, no. Tr. 5 at 1051. Dr. Ring el resisted further attempts to pin down an exact estimate for the time of Thomas' death for the reasons sta ted earlier, and adde d that it ulti mately was irr eleva nt for the issue a t bar: \"The child was dead when they arrived. And whether it happene d one minute, six minutes, 24 minutes befor e, I don't see the purpose.\" Tr. 5 at 1053. He clarified his reading of the EKG readings taken a t the hospital: I believe I said originally there was no rhythm. I felt maybe there was, perha ps, some ventricula r fibrillation demonstrated, and then it looks like -- it's hard because the times aren't alway s on the strips. But it looks like in the time seque nce, the final ones were agonal, which is the typical thing we see when we've finished with CPR and dete rmined that there is no resuscitatability . Tr. 5 at 1054. Regarding potential alterna tive cause s for Thomas' death, . that SIDS is a \"diag nosis of exclusion,\" use d as a label when no cause is known, and that \"the revie ws of the -127-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 127 of 177pathologists do not indicate a known disease proce ss.\" Tr. 5 at 1056. Regarding the autopsy finding s, Dr. Ringe l only felt comforta ble giving an opinion on its obser vations of the heart. Tr. 5 at 1057. Dr. Ringe l categorized the heart's weig ht as the of normal,\" because the average weig ht for Thomas' age is 28 grams, and Thomas' heart weig hed 30 grams on autopsy , which he compar ed as \"virtually identical.\" Tr. 5 at 1057. Petitioners challeng ed Dr. Ringe l on this point , pointing out that a two gram differe nce from averag e meant Thomas' heart weighe d nearly ten per cent more than ave rage, but Dr. Ring el refused that a nalysis: No, you can't do that, because average is average. Every thing in medicine is considere d essentially normal, within two standard deviations of the mean. So that any mean or average has two standard deviations. Now, with knowing the mean, you can't just say what the two standard deviations are on either side, but they're very wide. So there 's no way that a 10-per cent differ ence off the mean is ever two standard de viations off the mea n. So 30 and 28 are virtually identical. Tr. 5 at 1057. Dr. Ringe l did stipulate that the autopsy repor t included \"indications\" of \"incr eased brain we ight.\" Tr. 5 at 1058. When Petitioners questioned Dr. Ringe as to whether SIDS was \"an appropr iate diagnosis,\" he refused to offer an opinion, because it was \"really a patholog ic diagnosis, and that SIDS has been discussed and argued about for decades now as to what you call SIDS and what you don't call SIDS,\" and ther efore saw the topic as outside his field. Tr. 5 a t 1058-59. He did c oncede that the examining patholog ist indicated in the autopsy repor t that he could not rule out the Hepatitis B vaccine as a causa l factor. Tr. 5 a t 1059-60. Next, Petitioners challeng ed Dr. Ringe l with the m edica l literature they saw as relevant t o his opinion. Dr. Ringe l, in responding to Dr. Connor's expert repor t, did not cite to the Dahha n and Cinca article s in his own expert repor t, which Petitioners found curious. Tr. 5 at 1060. Dr. Ringe l did study the Dahha n and Cinca paper s for their cardiologic import, and he \"read enoug h of the toxicolog y discussions to realize that all ethyl merc ury is not necessarily alike,\" which made him chary about ag reeing to Petitioners' pr oposition t hat \"ethy l mercury had a cardiac effect.\" Tr. 5 at 1061-62. When asked, regarding the subjects studied in the Dahha n article , whether \"ther e were chang es in the entire electrical conduction of the heart,\" Dr. Ringe l demurred, because of the wide varia tion in cardiac symptoms observe d, but he agreed that sever al abnorma lities were noted among the subjects, which varie d in nature and degree. Tr. 5 at 1071. Among those, there were some whose EKG demonstrated Q T wave prolong ation, which pre sents a risk of \"incr eased irritability , and potentially sudden death,\" but that depends on how prolong ed the QT interval is and what cause d the prolong ation. Tr. 5 at 1072. He explained the distinction by reference to Dr. Connor's testimony : He broug ht up the familial long QT syndrome, which is quite differ ent than other cause s of QT prolong ation. And famil ial long QT syndrome is the type of QT prolong ation that is particula rly high risk. Other QT prolong ations are not necessarily that high r isk. -128-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 128 of 177Tr. 5 at 1072. Dr. Ringe l did agree that the Dahha n study stated that \"all fatalities from merc ury poisoning showed a prolong ed QT interval,\" but he pointed out that none of the subjects in the Dahha n study were infa nts; the y oung est subject wa s fourtee n years old. Tr. 5 at 1073. This led Petitioners to ask Dr. Ringe l whether infants were more susceptible to cardiac injury from mercury exposure and/or tox icity, to which he replied, \"not necessarily .\" Tr. 5 at 1073. He elabor ated, \"The re are some things that are much more dang erous for an adult with, say, border line corona ry artery disease, which has little or no effect on a healthy infant.\" Tr. 5 at 1073-74. In fact, he said, prolong ed QT syndrome in particula r, if fatal, proves lethal during the teena ge years and there after, not during infanc y or early childhood. Tr. 5 at 1074-75. He stated that this was a g ood example of how infants \" might not be more susceptible\" to mer cury toxicity. Tr. 5 at 1075. Moving to the Cinca article , Dr. Ringe l descr ibed the study as on144 being specific about but ... did mention EKG abnorma lities and some microscopic chang es to suggest interstitial myocarditis.\" Tr. 5 at 1078-79. He explained that interstitial myocarditis leads to dysfunction and weakness and potentially irritability of the heart muscle, which c ould lead to ar rhythmias, which \"incr ease the risk of de ath.\" Tr. 5 at 1079. As to whether the medica l literature discussed i ndicates that \"ethy l merc ury has an effect on the ca rdiac tissue,\" Dr. Ringe l thought that these studies proved that prolong ed exposure to enormous doses of ethyl merc ury could lead to merc ury toxicity, which could include \"cardiac chang es and manifestations.\" Tr . ein subjects had145 been exposed to Serosin, which is composed of about 2 percent ethyl merc ury chloride. Tr. 5 at 1076. As to the cardiac abnorma lities noted in the paper , Dr. Ringe l \" Seven patients abnorma lity[:] ... showed prolong ed QT intervals, five showing depre ssion of the ST segments, flat or inverted T wave s and large U wave s, consistent with low serum potassium levels.\" Tr. 5 at 1077. He added, howeve r, that, \"After potassium supplementation, most values returne d to normal or nearly normal values.\" Tr. 5 at 1077. He went on to state the researchers' conclusion that \"perhaps the merc ury was affecting potassium levels ... [a]nd perha ps that the EKG chang es are related to potassium levels.\" Id. Regardin g the Damluji study filed by Respondent, Dr. Ringe l descr ibed the cardiac146 finding s that, \"The authors report there were no demonstrable cardiac chang es in the mild cases; modera te and severe cases had tachy cardia, occasionally arrhythmia, and in two cases a moderate rise of blood pressure .\" Tr. 5 at 1067.

Moving to the a dverse cardiac f indings in the Jalili article , Dr. Ring el summarized:148 In sever e cases, the pulse is irregular, sometimes with bradycardia. 149 Electroc ardiog raphic examination of sever e cases frequent ventricula r [ectopic] bea ts, pr olonga tion of interval, ssion the ST se gment, and T inversion....

When, regarding this finding s, Petitioners querie d Dr. Ringe l whether the authors of this study \"thoug ht that ethyl merc ury played a role in these people' s cardiac abnorma lities,\" Dr. Ringe l refused t he propositi on, stating, \"Yo u seem to use ethy l merc ury alway s generically , and I have to see whether that's really the case, and what they descr ibe here. So I can't answe r just yet.\" Tr. 5 at 1069- 70.

Tr. 5 at 1085. Dr. Ringe l did not dispute the contents of the work, and even stipulated that EKG a bnormalities in both children and a dults was discussed there in as a finding , but he disputed the re levanc e of suc h a sourc e in the conte xt of the issue at ba r: [W]hat they say is that particula rly high levels of exposure and chronic exposure can lead to toxic cardiac effects.

They refer to the Faroe Island experience , wher e the exposure took seven y ears to demonstrate an effec t. They mention that there were some effects of prena tal exposure, and that again, I think it was the Faroe Island experience , wher e the chang es were noted, subtle chang es were noted at seven years. They talk about a wide range of things. I didn't see anything that suggested sudden An extrasystole is \"a premature contraction of the heart that is independent of the normal rhythm and arises147 in response to an impulse in some part of the heart other than the sinoatrial node.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 659.

They talk a lot about older people, they talk about provoking corona ry artery disease, they talk about, ag ain, hy perte nsion and things of that sort. Tr. 5 at 1085-86. To this, Petitioners propositioned him again regarding whether \"ethy l merc ury has a cardiac effect,\" to which he responde d with qualifica tion, \"[T]hat's non-spec merc ury-conta ining compounds [do] appea r have t oxic effects on children a nd adults.\" Tr. 5 a t 1086. In sum, Dr. Ringe l did not find those poisoning studies to be relevant to the issue of whether the amount of ethyl merc ury in two Hepa titis B vaccines could cause sudden death in a newb orn infant: I did not find any of these relevant to the Kolakowski case. We've been discussing these article s, you've been asking me questions. I don't dispute the finding s of them at all, but we have no evidenc e that it bears any relationship to the Kolakowski case. Ther e is no interstitial myocarditis on the microscopic examination of the heart. There is no evidenc e of cong estive heart failure. There was no evidenc e of arrhythmia. We have no electroca rdiog rams to show us any of the finding s that any of these authors prese nted. So I didn't find any reason to be correlating these article s to the Kolakowski ca se. Tr. 5 at 1080-81. This exchang e led to a fruitful and telling discussion on Thomas Kolakowski's autopsy : Q ...When you revie wed the autopsies, did you see any indication that the lungs were cong ested? A Yes, the lungs were conge sted. But cong estion of the lungs will occur in a number of circumstances. I can feel comforta ble saying limit ed things about cong estion, because we deal with pulmonary cong estion as a large part of our practice of pediatric cardiology . But they also occur in patients who suffe r from suffoc ation. I've seen patient s in my days of taking care of patients in the ICU, of kids who would develop what we call flash pulmonary edema from obstru ctive apnea . The airwa y obstructs. They make intense respira tory motions. They create a lot of negative pressure in the chest, get fluid accumulation, and get pulmonary edema. So I've seen it happen befor e my eyes, so I know it can occur just from blockag e of the airwa y. Q And is it y our opinion rig ht now that Tommy suffe red suf focation? A I was explaining that as an alterna tive explanation to cong estive heart failure , saying tha t there a re othe r ways of g etting pulmonar y edema . But I 'm not g oing to diagnose his pulmonary edema . I would leave that to the patholog ists who have looked at the slides , and might have additional thoughts about it, and to the patholog ists who will be discussing the case. But I, I think it's fair, since I've made -131-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 131 of 177the statement, to say that what I've seen is consistent with things other than a primary cardiac de ath. Q So right now, as you're sitting in the stand, are you saying that Tommy suffe red a suffoc ation, and that's why he died? A I'm saying, as I raised in my statement, that we don't have to evoke exotic stretche s of imag ination to explain how this child died, when we have a situation, which has been rec ognized by the American Acade my of Pediatric s, to lead to this type of death. So when I read the case, the first thing that comes to mind is not that he is the one in hund reds and hundreds of thousands of patients who have been exposed to hepatitis vaccine, that this somehow cause d his sudden demise, when we know that bed-sha ring and suffoc ation related to bed-sha ring is a risk factor for this type of death. So I'm not saying I'm making the di agnosis, but I've pointed to the must more likely explanation of his demise. Tr. 5 at 1081-82. Later, Petitioners followed up on this point by asking the medical signific ance of the fact that Thomas was found to have blood from the nose and mouth, which was observe d by the EMTs and mentioned by his mother's af fidavit, to which Dr. Ring el responded: I believe I had seen in my career in critica l care an occasional patient that seeme d to have had some either suffoc ation or unexplained death, have some blood in the mouth. So I have an impression that that can be associate d with an asphy xial death, but it's not more than that. Tr. 5 at 1092. In response to a question from Petitioners that actua lly related to Petitioners' purported theory of tion, Dr . that the autonomic nervous system \"affects cardia c activity \" in tha t it \"helps to regulate the heart rate, speeding it up and slowing it down, depending on what is require d,\" and coordina tes \"the respira tory drive with the heart rate.\" Tr. 5 at 1086-87. He descr ibed the natur e and loc ation of those ner ves thusly : The main impulse for the [parasympathetic] nervous sy stem, the nega tive effect, if you will, or the slowing effect on the heart, comes down from the brain, the mid-brain, to t he vag us nerve into the chest. And t he acce lerant side of things, the sympathetic system, comes down throug h these paraspinal chains along the spinal cord f rom the mid-bra in down into the chest.151 Tr. 5 at 1087. Dr. Ringe l agreed that injury to the autonomic nervous system could potentially \"affect the body 's abili ty to respond to certain events, whether speeding it up or slowing the hea rt down.\" Id. The parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems together form the autonomic nervous system. See151 supra at note 121. -132-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 132 of 1776.

Also on the topic of Dr. Gilbert-B arness' published article s, she wrote one \"some years ago\" having to do with merc ury toxicity, and, in particula r, Minamata disease, named after Minamata Bay in Japan, wher e sever al poisoning studies have been conducte d due to the consumption of merc ury- contaminated fish. Tr. 5 at 1097. Her task was to examine the cases from the patholog y standpoint. Id. Another a rea of prof essional intere st for Dr. G ilbert-B arness, resulting in ove r three dozen publi shed article s, has been Sudden Infant Death, and the circumstance commonly referred to (improper ly, she maintains) a s Sudden I nfant De ath Sy ndrome, or SI DS: Well, I've been very interested in sudde n infant dea th, and ac tually the mecha nism of sudden infant death, because for a long time, and even now, many people refer to SIDS, meaning Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Well, what is a syndrome? It's ridiculous to call anything SIDS. And now I have, and hopefully most people are following my recommendation, that it should be called sudden infant death, and what the cause is. And in this particula r case, I'm convince d that it is an asphyxial or anoxic death. Tr. 5 at 1100- 01. Dr. Gilbert-B arness stated her conclusion in this case, that Thomas Kolakowski \"died from asphy xia due to anoxic encephalopathy ,\" a conclusion for which she has \"no doubt whatsoeve r.\" 152 Tr. 5 at 1103. The rest of her direct testimony was spent explaining her medical opinion, and the analy sis by which she dr ew that c onclusion. An hypoxic encephalopathy is an \"encephalopathy caused by hypoxia from either decreased rated of blood152 flow or decreased oxygen content of arterial blood.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 611. The prefix \"anoxic\" used in place of \"hypoxic\" means that the decrease is to the point of absolute cessation. -133-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 133 of 177Dr. Gilbert-B arness' introduction began with noting that she is \"familiar with the proce dures for conducting autopsies,\" so much so that she had \"written a book on pediatric autopsy patholog y,\" that was a \"rather large book, close to 1,000 pages.\" Tr. 5 at 1103. She had conducte d approximately 10,000 autopsies at the time of the hearing. Tr. 5 at 1104. She explained that organs are usually first prese rved in formalde hyde (or \"fixed in form\") prior to taking slide samples, althoug h sometimes the organs may be proce ssed for patholog ical examination when they are fresh. Tr. 5 at 1104. She could not tell from the medical records which proce dure was followed, because no microsc opic ex amination was written up in Thomas' autopsy repor t. Id. Over all, her positi on on the quality of the slide prese ntation differ ed sharply from that of Dr. Shane, because she \"thoug ht the slides were [of] poor quality \" and substandard clarity, althoug h they were not so poor to be unintelligible. Id. For example, she observe d \"artifacts\" on the slides, which could result from \"dirt on the slide,\" \"po or fix ation,\" or other ex terna l influence s. Tr. 5 at 1105. Specifica lly, on a slide with myocardial heart tissue from Thomas Kolakowski's autopsy slides, Dr. Gilbert-B arness pointed out \"all those little black spec ks all over that slide is artifa ct, and that's, excuse me, disgr aceful to even prese nt a slide like that.\" Tr. 5 at 1106. Moreove r, discussing the same slide, Dr. Gilbert- Barness stated: [Y]ou can see that there is no interstitial myocarditis. I think that's good to show that, because there 's absolutely no inflammatory reaction there , which was descr ibed by Dr. Shane . And I 'm sorry , but it jus t wasn't ther e. Tr. 5 at 1106. Moving back to discuss the autopsy repor t in general, Dr. Gilbert-B arness noted that the autopsy was only a descr iption of gross finding s and weig hts, but included no microscopic analy sis. Tr. 5 at 1106-07. When asked whether she would expect to see a microscopic analy sis in a case like this, Dr. Gilbert-B arness said that doing so wa s \"all par t of an a utopsy .\" Tr. 5 a t 1107. Next, Dr. Gilbert-B arness began her discussion about her theory as to what cause d Thomas Kolakowski's death. She believes \"esse ntially all [of] the so-ca lled SIDS cases, almost all of them, have turned out to be anoxic encephalopathy ,\" due either to \"the prone position, or overly ing, or water beds an all these other devices that have resulted in anoxic death.\" Tr. 5 at 1107. In her opinion, her experience has shown that, in those cases wher e \"medica l examiners [classified] a case as SIDS,\" the microscopic evidenc e actua lly supports hypoxic/ischemic injury. Tr. 5 at 1108. 153 Moving to the instant case, Dr. Gilbert-B arness found it signific ant that \"the medical records suggest that at the least, Mrs. Kolakowski was co-slee ping with Thomas at the time of death,\" inasmuch as \"co-sleeping [can] lead to overly ing, a nd result in an anoxic death.\" Id. Dr. Gilbert-Barness provided a gloss for her terminology:153 Hypoxia is lack of oxygen, very low oxygen levels in the blood.... Anoxia means no oxygen. So in a way, that's a misnomer. It's better to call it hypoxia, but most people do refer to it as hypoxia/anoxia.... Ischemia is lack of oxygen in tissue. So if something is ischemic, it has lacked oxygen or blood supply. Tr. 5 at 1107-08. -134-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 arness compar ed that evidenc e with the evidenc e for merc ury toxicity, weig hed in the context of her profe ssional experi ence with mercury poisoning. Tr. 5 at 1109. To her, the indicia of merc ury toxicity are distinctive and many of them are specific , such that if exposure to merc ury had been integ ral in Thomas' death, the record would reflect tell-tale signs. Id. Not only154 did Thomas Kolakowski not evidenc e those indicia, he did not appea r to manifest the ones claimed by Petitioners: Q ...[D] id you find any evidenc e that Thomas Kolakowski may have had dysrhythmia prior to the nig ht that he passed a way? A I don't believe he did. I think that the irregularity of the heart was probably agonal.... Which many patients have . Q So it's certainly nothing spe cific to mer cury. A No. Tr. 5 at 1110. Dr. Gilbert-B arness differed with Dr. Shane's finding of \"diffuse interstitial edema in all sections of the heart, and in particula r, in the interve ntricular septum.\" Tr. 5 at 1110. She stated, \"In fact, I was so conc erned that I saw a bsolutely nothing, that I wonder ed whe ther I was thi nking right or not. So I showed it around to six of my colleag ues, patholog ists. And they confirme d what I had said, that there was no evidenc e of a myocarditis.\" Tr. 5 at 1110-11. She did not see any of 155 the \"inflammatory cell infiltrate,\" or the \"mitochondrial cell shrinkag e\" cardiac septum or the \"myocardial cell dege neration,\" all of which Dr. S hane said he observed in the slide samples. Tr. 5 at 1111. She did not see what he noted in the way of \"chronic proce ss going on in the heart.\" Id. Gilbert-B arness thought Thomas' heart ht was well within the normal \"standa rd deviation\" range, and that a heart weig ht woul d have to be \"at least 35 or maybe 40 [grams] befor e you would be conce rned.\" Tr. 5 at 1112. There fore, her opinion, based on both the As Dr. Gilbert-Barness explained,154 Well, many years ago, and I hate to say how many years, but when I was a medical student attending the wards at the Children's Hospital there, there were many children who suffered from a condition which was called acrodynia. And that was due to mercury intoxication. These babies had been given a mercury compound, mercurous chloride I believe it was, that caused toxicity. And they had extreme photophobia. They couldn't stand seeing the light. And I'd go into these wards with, you know, 20, 30 patients, with their heads buried in the pillow because they couldn't stand the light. And they are examples of acute mercury toxicity. And I actually, as a medical student, wrote a paper on it, that was never published, but it was interesting to me, that finally they found that it was due to mercury. Q Would you say that the clinical manifestations were stark? A Oh, yes, absolutely. Tr. 5 at 1109. Dr. Gilbert-Barness defined myocarditis as \"an inflammation of the heart muscle ... usually due to a viral155 infection or some other type of infection that causes it.\" Tr. 5 at 1110. -135-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 135 of 177gross finding s and her own microscopic revie w, was that Thomas' heart was not \"swollen due to edema .\" Id. The autopsy 's gross ex amination noted fine petec hial hemorrha ges on the left ventricle of Thomas' heart, which Dr. Gilbert-B arness stated was \"typical of an anoxic death,\" and lends support for her conclusion. Tr. 5 at 1112-13. Another finding of the autopsy 's gross examination-30cc of bilatera l sanguineous pleura l fluid-was not deter minative either way, because it was not a large amount relatively speaking; howeve r, it was consistent with hypoxic death. Tr. 5 at 1113. She explained how: First, \"there is dilatation of capillar ies, the small blood vessels,\" and then \"they burst, and you can get these little petec hial hemorrha ges that we call them, or exudation of fluid, particula rly in the pleura .\" Tr. 5 a t 1113-14. Asked what she made of the diffuse c onsolidation156 of the lungs, Dr. Gilbert-B arness referred to the microscopic data of \"hemor rhages in the lung, and ... cong estion of the capillar ies of the air space s, which she viewed as \"also very good supportive evidenc e of a hypoxic or an anox ic inasmuch as \"in an asphy xial ... lack of oxygen [during which t]he infant strug gles for air momentarily , it succumb s[, leading to] dilatation of cap illaries, bursting of the capillaries, and hemorrha ges.\" Tr. 5 at 1114. She added, \"particularly in asphy xial deaths, you'll find areas of hemorrha ge in the lungs [which are] so striking that I can just look at lungs, and ... I'm sure that that is an asphy xial death.\" Tr. 5 at 1114-15. She agreed with Shane's notation of \"prominent alveolar wall capillar y dilation and cong estion,\" but viewed the finding as more supportive of asphy xial, and therefor e hypoxic, death. Tr. 5 at 1115. She agreed that the lungs were heavy , but stated that this was also due to the asphy xial proce ss she had been descr ibing. Tr. 5 at 1116. None of these finding s would have require d a chronic proce ss, she maintained, insisti ng that asphy xia is created,\" because of the strug gle to breathe, such that \"it probably could occur within a couple of minutes, or even less.\" Id. Moving on within the autopsy repor t, Dr. Gilbert-B arness thought the notation about cong estion in the liver was consistent with her conclusion, because \"in a case of an asphy xial death, all the organs become cong ested, because this is a strug gle to get more oxygenate d blood to the baby .\" Tr. 5 at 1117. Simi larly, with the oral and nasal bleeding , Dr. Gilbert-B arness stated that such finding s are \"very commonly seen in asphy xial deaths,\" adding alwa of bed- sharing -related asphy xia. Tr. 5 a t 1118. In sum, there was nothing in the patholog ical finding s in this case that would lead Dr. Gilbert-B arness to believe Thomas Kolakowski's death resulted from anything else besides hypoxic or anoxic death by asphy xiation. Tr. 5 at 1117. She said the patholog ical evidenc e was not just consistent with such a c onclusion, but diag nostic of it. Tr. 5 at 1118. Dr. Gilbert-Barness saw that term almost as a term of art in pathology, used outside the manner it is typically156 used clinically: I think he's described it as consolidation. It's not really consolidation as we usually use that term, to mean pneumonia, or consolidation in that respect. But if you have hemorrhage in the lung, the lungs look fairly solid. And that's why he's described it as consolidated. Tr. 5 at 1115. -136-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 136 Gilbert-B arness stated that even the descr iption of the depende nt lividit y in the EMT and hospital recor ds supported a c onclusion of asphy xial death: Well, after de ath, and this is positional, blood se eps down to the pe ndant portions. And there are areas of what's called lividit y. That's a bluish-reddish appea rance of the skin. And that is because of the pooling of the blood. [I]n this c ase, the person who did the autopsy descr ibed it as purple. Well, that is another feature of an anoxic death. The li vidity looks much darker and purple. And he actua lly descr ibed t his, not realizing what he was really saying, but tha t was what was said.... [The lividit y looks da rker, or purple b]ecause befor e death, there must be some period of time - - and I can't tell you how long -- but w hen the infant is star ting to ha ve the effects of asphy xia, then there 's a lack of oxygen. And so the blood, befor e death, is hypoxic; and ther efore, the se eping of the blood af ter de ath tends to be more purple. Tr. 5 at 1119. L ater, on cross-e xamination, Dr. Gilber t-Barness stated that \"lividity occur s within probably 30 minutes , or certainly within an hour of death,\" and reiter ated that \"if it's dark and purple, a s this case wa s, one would strong ly suspect an a sphyxial death.\" Tr. 5 at 1132. Dr. Gilbert-B Dr. Shane's assessment that Thomas' tempera ture indicated his death had been very recent to when he was discovered unresponsive: S he would not expect the body tempera ture to drop precipitousl y after death occur red, saying, \"It drops slowly over a period of time ... usually said to be about one degree per hour.\" Tr. 5 at 1120. She stated that Thomas' tempera ture, recorded in the hospital as 96.4\u00b0F, correlates to having been deceased for two hours at that point. Id. This would place the time of death at 5:30 AM that morning . Tr. 5 at 1125. Also, regarding the clinical records, Dr. Gilbert-B arness found it relevant that Thomas was noted to have been experiencing a head cold in the period leading up to his death, inasmuch as seventy -five percent of sudden inf ant dea ths show a pre existing history of upper respira tory infec Kolakowski died from asphy xial death, presumably from overly ing. Tr. 5 at 1121. She clarified that she meant157 that the medical record redounde d to the conclusion of asphy xia, and Dr. Gilbert-B arness was presuming , based on the sparse evidenc e available on the subject ( i.e., co-slee ping) , that materna l overly the mecha nism of the asphy xiation; wher eas she held her opinion of asphy xia as a cause of death beyond a preponde rance of the evidenc e, she was not necessarily as committed to inadver tent materna l overly ing a s a mec hanism. Tr. 5 at 1121-24. The next relevant topic on cross-e xamination was the finding of left hemorrha ges, which Dr. said supported her conclusion of asphy xial death. Tr. Dr. Gilbert-Barness explained what she meant by that term thusly:157 Well, when a baby is in bed with the mother, and she turns, she overlies and squashes the face. And it's well known that babies up to four to six months of age are obligate nasal breathers. If you obstruct the nose, they are asphyxiated. Even though their mouth may be open. And this is a factor that not many people realize, but these babies are obligate nasal breathers. So if this baby was lying with the mother, and the mother turned and obstructed the nose, then asphyxia will occur. Tr. 5 at 1121. -137-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 1125-26. Dr . Gilbert-B arness stated that those hemorrha ges could occ ur any wher e, including the heart, as they were in this case. Tr. 5 at 1126. Petitioners querie d whether the simple act of performing CPR on an infant like Thomas could cause petec hial hemorrha ges, but Dr. Gilbert- Barness rejoined t hat such a result would be im possible if the infant wa s alrea dy dead by the t ime CPR was attempted, and that CPR \"will not hemorrha said, \"Petec hial hemorrha ges are such an absolute landmark for an asphy xial death\" that they have their own term in that context (\"Tardieu spots\"), and \"have been known for158 centur ies.\" Gilbert -Barness explained that, althoug h such hemorrha ging can appea r anywher e in the body in the event of asphy xia, they are most common in the pleura , but also are known to appea r in the heart, thymus, and eyes. Tr. 5 at 1126-27. In Thomas' case, they were only seen in the he art. Tr . 5 at 1129. Regarding the 30cc of bilatera l, sanguinous, ple ural fluid, Dr. opined tha t, like the petec hial hemorrha ges, the larger amount of serosa nguinous fluid was a produc t of the asphy xia, and is a very common finding in asphy xial deaths. Tr. 5 at 1129-31. They are both cause d by the enormous negative pressure cause d by the suction of blocked inhalation. Tr. 5 at 1136. Fluid in the pleura l cavities is common as an artifa ct of agonal proce ss, said Dr. Gilbert-B arness, and \"most fluid has blood in it.\" Tr. 5 at 1130. When challeng ed by Petitioners, Gilbert-B arness agreed that viscera l organ cong estion is nonspecific and can be cause d by many things. Tr. 5 at 1131. She did maintain that the finding of viscera l organ cong estion is certainly consis tent with asphy xial death, though, as it is cause d by \"a dilatation of all the vessels, particula rly the capillar ies,\" leading to the accumulation of much fluid. Tr. 5 at 1139. \"To a certain extent,\" the same can be said regarding the bra in. Tr. 5 at 1140. Petitioners challeng ed Dr. Gilbert-B arness on her estimation for time of death, asking , \"if a child has been dead for two hours, how can there still be electrical activity in the heart?,\" to which she replied that, \"the electrical circuit may not be entirely shut off,\" adding \"Arrhythmias at the time of dea th are not uncommon.\" Tr. 5 at 1133-34. Pressing further on this point , Petitioners queried how t he heart could still be active if the bl ood in the circulatory system is not moving, but pooled in one spot , to which Dr. Gilbert-B arness replied tha t the conduction sy stem is really electric, and can be stimul ated or active electrically , even if not me chanic ally opera tional to move blood. Tr . 5 at 1135. The last topic of cross-e xamination was a crucial discussion about nomenclature, and the loaded term of \"SIDS.\" When asked if her opinion was that Thomas Kolakowski \"died from SIDS,\" Dr. Gilbert-Bar ness astutely clarified that \"some people would call it SIDS,\" but that she was \"calling it an asphy xial death,\" as part of \"a hypoxic/ano xic type of injury .\" Tr. 5 at 1140. A moment later, she e labora ted furthe r: A lot of people still call this SIDS. Asphy xia. It's only recently , and I'm very proud of the fact that I'm one of the people who insisted that the sleeping position be chang ed, and that parents were advised when they left the hospital with a new baby Tardieu's spots are \"spots of ecchymosis under the 1745. Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 138 of 177that they have the baby sleep on ... the back. Because the prone position has now been strong ly related to what has been called SIDS. And it's what I believe is an asphy xial death. Tr. 5 at 1140-41. Petitioner followed up by noting that the medical examiner \"did not assig n cause of death to be an asphy xial hypoxic type of death,\" to which Dr. Gilbert-B arness responded that, \"Well, he called it SIDS, which is, to me is saying the same thing.\" Tr. 5 at 1142. Petitioners rightly pointed out that the medical examiner termed the death \"sudden death in inf ancy\" which is just \"a diagnosis of ex clusion,\" and Dr. Gilbert-Ba rness clarified that \"he didn't really find any thing. So he's calling it sudden infant -- that's the same thing as SIDS, sudden death in infanc y, yes. But that means nothing .\" Id. This sparke d a discussion about the major problem with using SIDS as a diagnostic tool: in some cases, it truly is just a diagnosis of exclusion-a medical throwing up of hands in bewilder ment, while in other cases it is descr ibing a specific constellation of symptoms that, in all descr ibes the ef fect of posi No. 05- 1261V, 2008 WL (F ed. Spec. Mstr. 4, 2008) . The following intercha nge is illustrative: Q So there 's no other cause . They ruled out all the other cause s, and that's what they believe it is, is SI DS. A Well, if it's SIDS as I believe it is, it's an asphy xial death. There is no evidenc e whatsoeve r that this could be anything but an asphy xial death. And I really stand firm on that. I 've se en hundre ds of ca ses, and I know this area . Q So Doctor, when you revie wed the autopsy repor t, you did see that Dr. Ross indicated that he could not draw a conclusion as to whether or not Heptava x was causa lly connec ted to the child's dea th. A Yes, I think he did sa y that. But he didn't even give a microscopic opinion, repor t. Q So you disag ree with Dr. Ross, who did the actua l autopsy ? A Well, I disag ree with that statement, y es.

Eve r since she had begun her residency , she had been deleg ated the task of performing all pediatric autops ies, and was very experience d in that regard when she was named chief . Tr. 6 at 1461. There after, she was named chief of Neur opatholog y, and then chief of the entire Pathology depar tment befor e seven years had passed since her fellowship. Id. During that interval, she began serving simult aneously as the sole neuropa thologist at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia. Id. Back at Philadelphi a Gene ral, she also serve d as President of the m edica l staff, and, for a brief stint, as Medica l Director for the hospital. Id. Eventually , she left Philadelphia Gene ral to work exclusively at Children's Hospital (whe re she again serve d as president of the medical staf f) and joined the offic e of the Medica l Examiner f or Philadelphia.

Also, she sat on the c ertifica tion board for the Americ an Board of Patholog y, developing examination questions for the neuropa thology examination component. Tr. 6 at 1468. She descr ibed her editorial revie w board work for scientific and medical publications as \"reviewing manuscripts that have been submitt ed for possible publication in the journal, and to make certain that the materia l in the manuscript is scientifica lly sound,\" which, she added, was \"a very major responsibility , to make certain that foolishness doesn't get into the literature , [such that it could be] ultimately carried on and quoted.\" Tr. 6 at 1467. She performed this work, over the years, for the Journal of Neuropathology and Expe rimental Pediatric Neuroscienc e (now Pediatric Neurosurgery of the Child's Nervous System ), Brain Pathology , the International Journal of Neuroradiology (for which she was one of the original editors), the Journal of Surgical Pathology, Histology, and Histopathology , and the editorial advisory board for the Pediatric Cance r Treatment Group at NIH. Tr. 6 at 1468. In authoring her own article s, her particula r interest lies in \"[c]hil dhood brain tumors, forensic neuropa thology as it deals with children,\" and she had previously done much in the area of \"central nervous sy stem infections, primar ily those ca used by viruses.\" Id. One of her a rticles (he r 147th) was entitled, \"Anatomica l Featur es of the Developing Brain Implicated in Pathogenesis of Hypox ic-Isc hemic Injury .\" Tr. 6 at 1469. She wrote a book, for which she and another doctor spent seven years of research, discussing the myelination of the infant brain. Tr. 6 at 1470. She had \"just contributed a chapte r to a two-volume book that Dr. Gilbert had edited,\" for which she wrote the nervous system chapte r, the longe st in the book at 150 pages, and which is the standard in patholog y labora tories: \"I don't know about medical students; it's a little bit too detailed for medical students. But it's ce rtainly used in the training of patholog y residents a nd fellows.\" T r. 6 at 1471. -140-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 140 of 177She define d the field of neuropa thology as \"the study of the nervous system [including ] the brain, spinal cord, the cover ings, the periphe ral nerve s, and the muscles.\" Tr. 6 at 1457. She contra dicted a point made by Dr. S hane, made when he said he would be qualified by his training and experience to sit for the neuropa thology board certification examination, but just had never done so, because it was not the \"in\" thing to do at the time: She stated that a doctor that had not completed a specia l fellowship, such as the one she participa ted in, would not even be eligible to sit for the neuropa thology subspecialty examination. Tr. 6 at 1458-59. She said the exception to this rule would have been in the case of a doctor who \"had enter ed the field, and had distinguished himself or herse lf over a period of years\" during the time befor e the establish ment of the neuropa thology board, which Dr. Rorke-A dams said were instit uted \"sometime in the fifties.\" Tr. 6 at 1459. She gave two examples, of which she was persona lly familiar, of neuropa thologists who were top experts in neuropa thology who nonetheless sat for the examination despite not having underg one such a fellowship and were thus \"grandf ather ed in,\" which would have been, in any event, \"a very unusual situation in which they've had extensive experience and are recognized by their peers throug hout the country and the wor ld.\" Id. Next, Dr. Rorke-Ada ms describe d tric neur baby brain rathe r difficult thing; most g eneral patholog ists find it too much of a challeng e, and don't pay too much attention to it. Beca use the problem i n pediatric neuropa thology involves not only knowing the pathology , but you have to know the neuroa natomy . And in a baby , the neuroa natomy is constantly chang ing. So that what is normal development at, let's say 32 weeks' gestation, i s not normal development at 38 weeks' gestation. So you have a constantly moving target, so to spe ak, when you're trying to deal with baby brains. And then there are many diseases that are unique to babies that one never sees in the adult population. So it's a very difficult and complex and challeng ing subspecialty . Most of the literature was in German. F ortunately , I read German, s o I was able to tap into the experience of the Ge rman pa thologists. Tr. 6 at 1464. She added that all of her patholog y practice is spent on pediatric patholog y, and that, among the pediatric neuropa thologists in the entire world, \"proba bly five or six [are] in this country at the most; and throug hout the world, may be anothe r 15 or 20.\" Tr. 6 at 1464- 65. Dr. Rorke-A dams began her testimony in chief by stating her conclusion that Thomas Kolakowski \"died as a conseque nce of lack of oxygen to his nervous system,\" and that his death had nothing to do with merc ury toxicity. Tr. 6 at 1473. Dr. Rorke-A dams said it was typical for organs to be prese rved in formalde hyde befor e samples are taken to be fixed for microscopic analy sis, which she presumed had been done in Thomas' case, as \"[t]here would be no reason to do otherwise.\" Tr. 6 at 1473. She thought that the patholog y slides prepa red from Thomas' autopsy -at least those of the nervous system-were \"rather (thoug still ble technica l artifa ct, which suggested to me that perha ps the tissue wasn't too well fixed, or that the technicia n prepa ring the sections wasn't experience d.\" Tr. at 1474-75. She descr ibed artifa cts as \"[t]ears in the tissue, and things that are really not part of the patholog ical proce ss, but have to be contende d with.\" Tr. 6 at 1474. She noted -141-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 141 of 177that, although the autopsy contained \"a fairly good descr iption of the gross patholog y,\" any descr iption of a microscopic analy sis was lacking , which she \"certainly would have\" expected to be done, \"particular ly in a case where the pathol ogist really couldn't come to a definitive conclusion about the ca use of de ath, and use d kind of a c op-out diag nosis of sudden infant de ath or sudden159 unexpected death.\" Tr. 6 at 1475. She added that an \"autopsy is not complete unless you do a microscopic\" analy sis. Id. When she was asked \"how often [she was] able to deter mine that [a] child died as a result of hy poxic or anoxic ischemic injury ,\" Dr. \"Well, if it's there , we can160 usually deter mine it. Unless they die, you know, within seconds or something.\" Tr. 6 at 1476. She added that, far from being a rare finding , hypoxic ischemic finding s were \"quite common.\" Id. The reference in the me dical re cords that Mrs. K olakowski was sha ring a bed w ith Thomas leading up to the discovery of his nonresponsive state was signific ant to Dr. Rorke-A dams, althoug h she did not think an actua l \"roll-ove r\" would have to occur to cause a co-slee ping- related asphy xia: \"[T]he nose can be cover ed up by a pillow or a blanket or something, so somebody doesn't actua lly have to roll over on the child. But that's the general term we use in the office .\" Tr. 6 at 1478-79. She stated that Dr. Rorke-Adams explained the problem of \"SIDS\" as a diagnostic term:159 Well, first of all, it's not a syndrome. It's not like some well-known clinical entity in which you have various components that all work together to produce the disease. Sudden infant death syndrome is a term that has appeared, and is part of the literature, to represent the fact that an infant dies for no apparent reason. And after extensive investigation of the clinical aspects ... leading up to the death, the completion of the autopsy, plus or minus other kinds of studies as are available, then you come up with no rational explanation for why the individual died. And this is why I used the term \"cop-out\" before. Because it's basically a diagnosis of exclusion. You've done everything you can to try to determine why the child died, and you haven't been able to do so, and so you call it SIDS. Or the term that we use now, preferably, is sudden unexpected death. Q And is it a frequent occurrence in your experience that a medical examiner will label a case a sudden infant death, or sudden unexplained death; and then, on microscopic, further microscopic review, it becomes evident to you that it's a hypoxic ischemic injury? A Yes. Q Or a hypoxic ischemic cause of death. A Right. Tr. 6 at 1477-78. Dr. Rorke-Adams provided the following gloss for those three terms:160 [H]ypoxia simply refers to a decrease in oxygen. So it's less than what is required.... Anoxia is total lack of oxygen. That doesn't happen very often.... Ischemia refers to blood flow, so it refers to inadequate blood flow. And they're two words I generally use together, because if you have sufficient hypoxia, eventually the blood flow is going to be reduced as well, because hypoxia to the body is going to affect the heart, along with all of the other organs. So the heart will start failing. So that means that the contractibility of the heart is not sufficiently strong to maintain the blood flow. And so you then have the combination of the hypoxia with the ischemia. Tr. 6 at 1476-77. -142-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 142 of 177oral-na sal bleeding was a \"quite common\" a nd consistent finding in hy poxic ischemia deaths. Tr. 6 at 1479. Still discussing the clinical finding s, Dr. Rorke-A dams explained that the medical records' reference to \"depe ndent lividit y\" meant that there had been \"a pooling of the blood into the depende nt parts of the body ,\" going on to explain how it could be used to deter mine the position of the person when they died, or at least how they came to rest: [M]ost people die lying in bed, on their back. And so the lividit y is usually on the back. But if you're in some other position -- for example, if you're on y our fa ce -- then the lividity is going to be on the fr ont of y our body . Tr. 6 at 1479. With regard to the gross finding s made by the medical examiner in the autopsy , the finding of \"cerebral edema but no evidenc herna tion or other gross abnorma lity\" (Resp. Ex. E at 3) was of par ticular intere st to Dr. Rorke-A dams: Well, he uses the term \"cerebral edema \" as an explanation or as a descr iption of brain swelling . Now, brain swelling may be a conseque nce not only of incre ased water in the brain, but it's also a consequenc e of incre ased blood in the brain. And the incre ased volume of blood in the brain is a conseque nce of the fact that you don't have proper circulation, so the blood is pooling in the brain. The other thing that makes the brain heavie r than normal -- and I presume he called it edema because the brain weig hed 540 grams, in contra st to an expected mean of 441 grams -- is that when y ou have hy poxia -- that is, when the brain is not getting a s ufficie nt amount of oxygen, there is a mecha nism that we refer to as autoregulation. And autore gulation is a phenomenon which occur s in all of us if there are chang es in the conce ntration of oxygen coming to the brain, or if there 's a decrea se in the blood flow. For example, if your blood pressure goes down to 50 or 40 or something, and you're not getting proper flow. So the phenomenon of autore gulation becomes active. And this involves dilatation of the blood vessels in the brain that, many of which are not ordinarily carrying blood, but all of the available blood vessels start opening up to take whateve r blood is coming , and to extract from that blood whateve r oxygen is being carried to it in order to supply the brain. So when you have a situation of hypoxia, then this phenomenon is going to kick in. So you're going to get more blood in the brain that you ordinarily have, which would then incre ase the weig ht of the brain. Now, the importan ce here, and I suspect that's why Dr. Ross mentioned this, he says, \"Cere bral edema , but no evidenc gross abnorma lity.\" Now, hernia tion refers to a phenomenon that is very important in terms of cerebral edema or swelling . And that indicates that this has gone on for a while, and that there 's a displaceme nt of the brain throug h the only opening in the skull that will allow for any incre ased expanse. Howeve r, this is a five-w eek-old baby , and the sutures are still open. So this brain could have swollen much more than your brain or my brain, under the circumstances , without any evidenc e of hernia tion. But since Dr. Ross ibing edema , he felt it necessa ry to point out that there was no he rniation. Tr. 6 at 1514- 1516. -143-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 143 of 177Moving on to the microscopic evidenc e, Dr. Rorke-A dams corroborate d with aspec ts of Dr. Shane's analy sis regarding gliosis, valid finding , althoug h161 she di spute d what he said about t he invol vement of the ol igode ndra, say ing, \"They don't respond to injury in quite the way that the astrocy tes respond[, a]nd when you have specifie d separ ately [; i]t's not unde r the general umbrella of gliosis.\" Tr. 6 at 1480-81. She continued: And oligode ndrog lia are a very specia l kind of cell in the nervous system, whose job it is to form the myelin sheath that I was mentioning earlier that forms the insulation of the axons. So in areas of injury , the oligodendrog lia only respond in a very specific kind of way. And in particula r, when there is brain edema, the oligode ndrog lia will become swollen; their nuclei will sometimes disintegr ate. But you never use the term \"gliosis\" in connec tion with anything that the oligode ndrog lia are doing. Tr. 6 at 1481. She he rself did not find g liosis i n her e xamination of the slides. Id. The next point of contention betwee n Dr. Rorke-A dams and Dr. Shane's prior testimony regarded the \"drop- out\" of cerebellar granula r cells, which Dr. Shane descr ibed, but which Dr. Rorke-A dams did not believe was present. Tr. 6 at 1482. Viewing the same photomi crograph of Thomas Kolakowski's brain slide, which had been shown to Dr. Shane (and which he decla red unintelligible), she stated that she c ould disti nguish gr anular cells. Id. She elabor ated: I can tell this is an infant cerebellum, because the infant cerebe llum has a differe nt anatomy than the adult cerebellum.... The infant cerebellum looks quite differ ent from the adult cerebellum, at least up to one year of age. And we have, in the infant cerebellum, a layer of cells out here. This is outside the brain. That part is called the subara chnoid space . This layer of cells over here is called the external granula r layer.... ...Now, when you're dealing with a baby , the population of cells in the internal granula r layer incre ases as the population of cells in the external granula r layer decreases. Now, there is this peculiar ity about the development of the cerebellum in the baby . And these cells out here are still underg oing prolifer ation; they're incre asing in numbers. their job is to populate the internal Dr. Rorke-Adams explained the finding of gliosis, and its significance as a diagnostic tool:161 Gliosis is a reaction of the glial cells in the brain, in particular the astrocytes. And they represent some kind of reaction to injury. The astrocytes are the cells in the nervous system that provide the scars in the nervous system. And so there are certain kind of astrocytes in the brain that when there is some injury to the brain, the astrocytes are stimulated to proliferate. And when, if the individual comes to the attention of a pathologist, we can recognize the histological reaction. And the general term is gliosis. Tr. 6 at 1480. -144-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 144 of 177granular cell layer. So for a baby of five weeks of age, this is a perfectly normal cerebellum in terms of population of inter nal and e xterna l granular cells. Tr. 6 at 1483-84, 1486. Dr. Rorke-A dams then stated her opinion that there was no perceivable drop-out among the g ranula r cells in Thomas Kolakowski's autopsy slides. Tr. 6 at 1487. On the same section of brain slide, though at a highe r magnification, Dr. Rorke-A dams said: [W]e can see the detail of the internal granula r neurons, and you can see the Purkinje cells, which look quite fine. They are quite normal and show no abnorma lity.... This is the internal granula r cell layer. There is kind of an artifa ctual cleavage here betwee n these two layers. That's not uncommon in baby brains, because baby brains have a l ot more water in them than adult brains. And when you put the tissue into formalde hyde, it dehy drate s the tissue and sort of pulls it apart. Tr. 6 at 1488-89. Wherea s Dr. Shane had stated his opinion that the separ ation in layers of granula r cells represente d a disease proce ss befor e death , Dr. Rorke-A dams dismiss ed that separ ation as mere ly \"an a rtifac t of the fixation\" of the tissue onto the slide. Tr. 6 at 1490. Regarding Dr. Shane's expert repor t, which had noted degeneration in varying degrees of the cerebellar granula r cells based on loss of nuclea r detail and obscure cell marg ins, while Dr. Rorke- Adams stipulated that, when prese nt, such a conclusion could be made based there upon, she disag reed that such was the case here. Tr. 6 at 1490. She did not believe the cell marg ins were obscure or that the nuclei lacke d detail, and though that such a statement could not be made in any event without ana lysis with an electr on microscope : As I indicated, the problem with these granula r cells is that they don't have much of a cell body , so all you see is the nucleus. So that you can't really talk about the cell marg ins, because that us ually refers to the cy toplasm. And s ince y ou can't see the cytoplasm very well, unl ess y ou look at it with the electron microsc ope, there's no way that y ou can ma ke a sta tement about it. Tr. 6 at 1491. Regarding Dr. S hane' s reference i n his testimony to \" perivascular , perig lial, perine uronal clear space s\" d the phenomenon with the term \"halo\" ), which he thought \"were more prominent than one would see with normal tissue shrinkag e,\" and \"assoc iated with edema ,\" Dr. Rorke-A dams had a differ ent position: [I]n the brain of a baby the water composition is about 85 percent. And you'll get much more shrinkag e artifa ct in a baby brain than you do in an adult brain. So that in my evalua tion of these sec tions, I didn't see anything to concer n myself in terms of what 's being descr ibed here. There was, howeve r, evidenc e of edema in these sections. And that was manifested by the phenomenon of the oligode ndrog lial reaction, which is called acute swelling of the oligode ndrog lia. And also some of those nuclei were disintegr ating . So there certainly was edema there . But the important identifica tion of the edema was not with the halos, but with the actua l chang es in the ce lls that were pr esent. -145-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 145 of 177Tr. 6 at 1491-92. The Court asked Dr. Rorke-A dams whether the edema should be classified as \"vasog enic or cytotox ic,\" to which she thought it \"very difficult to be absolutely specific ,\" but replied that, \"Unde r these circumstances, I would say it was a vasog enic kind of edema , because of the hypoxic injury to the endothelial cells, the cong estion and the edema , the loss of what we call the tight junctions in the endothelial c ells.\" Tr. 6 a t 1493. 162 Returning to the oligode ndritic cells, Dr. Rorke-A dams thought \"totally false\" Dr. testimony that the oligode ndrog lia was the \"fibrobla st of the brain ... mak[ing] scar tissue in an area of injury [and being ] more chronic -reactive.\" Tr. 6 at 1494, citing Tr. 3 at 604. She rejoined, \"The scar in the brain is made by the astrocy tes. The oligode ndrog lia do not make the scar.\" Id. She continued: As I said, the reaction on the part of the oligode ndrog lia is primarily in edema , wher e you have the acute swelling. As I said, their j ob is to make the myelin sheath, and the astroc ytes are the sca r tissue of the br ain. They 're equivalent to the fibroblast. And then the microg lia, which were also menti oned, come from the walls of the blood vessels, and they may participa te in the scar. But certainly the oligode ndrog lia cannot be equate d to fibroblasts. Tr. 6 at 1494-95. She added, more generally, that there was no \"evide nce that Thomas Kolakowski was experiencing a chronic patholog ic proce ss,\" noting that \"ther e was no activation of any of these cells, except for the acute swelling of the oligode ndrog lia that was part of the edema .\" Tr. 6 at 1495. Dr. Rorke-A dams also saw as y that is subrec ent, rathe r than very recent, because these are fibroblasts. Oligode ndrog lia don't get turned on immediately ; they get turned on a little bit later.\" Tr. 6 at 1495, citing Tr. 3 at 607. She explained that, \"The oligode ndrog lia are very speci fic, and they may be activate d fairly quickly , as a matter of fact, if you have cerebral edema . And they're not the fibroblasts.\" T r. 6 at 1496. I ndeed, she reiter ated, \" The sca rring in the brain is a conse quence of the activation and prolifer ation of the astrocy tes.\" Id. Also, returning to the finding of edema in the brain, Dr. Rorke-A dams disag reed with Dr. Shane's finding of spongiosis, as part of the163 She elaborated on this same point:162 The brain blood vessels are unique in that they have some attachments between the cells lining the interior wall of the blood vessel, so that they don't allow the movement of a lot of substances which are exchanged easily in other organs of the body. And the major issue here is that in hypoxia, the endothelial cells, which are the ones that are stuck together, come apart, and they allow the movement of fluids and other things into the tissue. So this is primarily the vasogenic edema. The cytotoxic elements are much less obvious here. Tr. 6 at 1493-94. Dr. Rorke-Adams explained spongiosis as follows:163 Spongiosis is a histological finding in the tissue in which you have little tiny holes in the tissue. They look like little round circles mostly. And they're a consequence of the fact that the water which was in the, either the interstitial space, that is the space between the cells, or within the cells themselves. And we known that edema can accumulate either within the cell processes, in the processes of the -146-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 146 of 177cytoinflammatory proce ss he postulated, althoug h she did stipulate that there were oligode ndrog lial chang es. Tr. 6 a t 1497. Dr. Rorke-A dams also disag reed with Dr. Shane's characterization of the infant blood-brain barrier, contra sted to that of an older child's, that \"everything goes throug h the [infant's] blood-brain barrier\" and that, \"I t's not as much of a barrier.\" Tr. 6 at 1498, c iting Tr. 3 a t 618. She explained her disag reement: Well, the blood-brain barrier in a five-w eek-old infant is quite well develope d. I think the transfe r of maternal , things from the materna l circulation to the infant circulation is more important, or refers more to other organs of the body, and not specific ally to the brain. The blood-brain barrier in a baby allows for certain things to pass, but it has actua lly, even at the time of birth, a very well develope d blood-brain ba rrier. Tr. 6 at 1498-99. She elabor ated further regarding the selec tivity of the infant blood-brain ba rrier, in contrast to the deve lopment at later stag es: Well, the structure is well develope d. The blood-brain barrier in a baby in particula r allows the passag e for larger protein molecules to trave l back and forth. For this reason, for example, the spinal fluid of a baby will have a highe r protein content than the spinal fluid of an adult. But there are certain specific things that the baby's blood-brain barrier allows passage. But for all intents and purposes, it's a very excellent, well-func tioning blood-bra in barrie r. Tr. 6 at 1500. Dr. Rorke-Adams also demonstrated her ex pertise on this topic by referencing that she was persona lly selec ted to revie w a book specific ally on the blood-brain barrier by the editor of the Journal of Neurology , a medica l journal. Tr. 6 a t 1499. Moving on from her disputes conce rning Dr. Shane's revie w of the autopsy slides, Dr. Rorke- Adams registered her contentions regarding his relianc e on the Cinca article , in that it was an164 inapposite compar ison betwee n the subjects of the Cinca studies and Thomas Kolakowski, althoug h she had high praise for the Cinca article itself. Tr. 6 at 1501-02. She first descr ibed one distinctive finding , from a ne uropatholog ic per spective, w ithin the Ci nca study : [A]ll ove r the cerebral cortex, but mostly in the calcarine corte x -- that's the part of the brain in the back that's involved in visual impulses -- it says there was nerve loss and diffuse prolifer ation of neurog lia -- that's basical ly the astrocy tes -- on microscopic examination of the brain. And then it talks about neurog lial activation with nerve -cell satellitosis and neurona l loss in formation of neuronopha gic astrocytes, or in the myelin sheaths, or in the interstitial tissue. But when the water is removed by the dehydrating process, it leaves these little holes that we call spongiosis. Tr. 6 at 1496-97. Pet. Ex. 18, Tab V, I. Cinca et al., Accidental ethyl mercury poisoning with nervous system, skeletal muscle,164 and myocardium injury, 43 JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY, NEUROSURGERY, AND PSYCHIATRY 143-49 (1979). -147-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 147 of 177nodules.... [W]hat this refers to is the fact that the cell is underg oing necrosis ... [and this] is a response on the part of the astrocy tes and the microg lia, which are the garbage-collecting cells of the ne rvous sy stem, to come and take a way the nec rotic cell.... So it's eng ulfment, or the medic al term is phag ocytosis of the neuron. And that's done by these microg lial c ells, and then the astrocy tes participa te in this. It's a very specific histologica l reaction that is charac teristic.... [I]t's unus ual because, as I said, most of the time neuronopha gia results from viral infections. This is my , the first time I've seen this descr iption in conjunc tion with, with the merc ury intox ication. Tr. 6 at 1502-04. She was adama nt that these indicators of a specific patholog ic proce ss were absent from Thomas Kolakowski's autops y slides, saying, \"ther e was nothing that looked like a neuronopha gic nodule.\" Tr. 6 at 1503. She compar ed that specific finding to the more \"norma l phenomenon\" of satellitosis: All right, the sa tellitosi s is another phe nomenon, and that' s a normal phe nomenon actua lly. And the ce lls that a re involved in satellitosi s are the oligode ndrog lia, and they collect around the neurons, most particula rly in the cerebral corte x and in some deep nuclea r structure s called the corpus striatum. That's not patholog ical; it's165 something that you would expect to see if you were looking at the corte x or the brain. So they somehow or other appar ently didn't understand that. But certainly the neuronopha gic nodules are quite patholog ical. But there was nothing like that in this infant's bra in.... ...[S]atellit osis, as I said, is a normal phenomenon. So I can pick up any piece of brain c ortex or cer ebral cortex, and I can se e sate llitos is. I see tha t ever y day. Tr. 6 at 1504-05. Moreover, Dr. Rorke-A dams stated that satellitosis is unrela ted to the neuronop hagic nodules, and is not just a phase in what would ultimately result in them: \"[T]hey don't have anything to do with each other. Because satellitosis is a phenomenon of the oligode ndrocy tes, and neuronopha gic nodules are formed by astrocy tes in microg lia.\" Tr. 6 at 1505. Another distinction betwee n the Cinca finding s and the case of Thomas Kolakowski was the differ ence in Purkinje cell chang es: Wherea s, \"perfectly normal\" Purkinje subjects they from patholog areas silver impreg nation of neurof ibrils showed empty basket cells and torpedo-sha ped Purkinje cell axons.\" Tr. 6 at 1506. She descr ibed the Cinca finding s on this point as follows: Well, this is a chang e that is seen in merc ury intox ication in the cases that have, other than this one that we' re de aling with, ha ve been repor ted in liter ature , and that I 've seen myself in the case of merc ury intox ication. It's a finding that can only be identified by doing specia l staining. That is, you can't see these chang es on a routine H and E se ction, which is all we ha d in this particular c ase. The corpus striatum is \"one of the components of the basal nuclei; specifically, a subcortical mass of gray165 and white substance in front of and lateral to the thalamus in each cerebral hemisphere.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 423. -148-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 148 of 177Tr. 6 at 1506-07. She provided a photomicrog raph of brain cells in a case of merc ury toxicity, and descr ibed the distinguishing char acteristics: So in this particula r case of merc ury intox ication, this is the Purkinje cell layer here. There aren't any granule cells to speak of; maybe a couple over here, but for the most part they're gone. This is a Purkinje cell here, and then you can follow along , and it sends out a proc ess her e. And then the re's this bulbous swelling here .... ... This is the nucleus of the Purkinje cell here. This is a Purkinje cell here. This is a dying Purkinje c ell, and that's a more de generated one , as we ll. Q Okay . So what is the stark black in the middle that's, depending on the way the slide is turned, either above or below that Purkinje cell you were just speaking of? A This is the torpedo. This is what's described and what's shown i n figure 2 of the paper that Cinca wrote, and descr ibes the change in the cerebellum of the 15-year-old boy who died. So you see the connec tion of the Purkinje cells here, and it's comi ng down to this thing. And this is what we call the torpedo, and that's a chang e that is seen on the Purkinje cells in me rcury. It also shows that there are no basket c ells.... Q Is it fair to compar e the Purkinje cell finding s in Cinca with the case, with the case of Thomas Kola kowski? A No, because a silver stain wasn't done to look for any kind of chang es of this sort. Tr. 6 at 1508-10. She reiter ated that she did not tion of \"cell enlar gement, smudgy eosinophilic cytoplasm, and focal nuclea r fragmentation\" of the Purkinje cells, stating that she did not \"see any chang es of that sort\" nor, indee d, any \"deg eneration in Tr . 6 at 1510. Furthermore , on this same point, Dr. Rorke-A dams stated that, Dr. Shane's observa tions did not jibe with the signs of merc ury toxicity anyway (e.g., the \"torpe do\"), and that even if his observa tions were accepted, \"What he's descr ibing here, if they were present, would represent hypoxic ischemic chang es.\" Tr. 6 at 1510-11. She went on to say that her finding s of no effect on the Purkinje ce lls did not cells throug h hypoxic ischemia that Purkinje cells m ay be damag ed in hy poxic ischemia. They may not be damag ed. It depends on the period of hypoxia, the sever ity and so on.\" Tr. 6 at 1511. Ela borating on this point , she stated: There are certain neurons in the brain that are particula rly sensitive. The neurons in the cerebral corte x, in certain layers of the cerebral cortex, a certain population of cells in a part of the corte x called the hippocampus, and there are specific ally the pyramidal cells. The Purkinje cells may be affected. There is a certain other population of cells in the cerebellum in a nuclea r structure called the dentate nucleus, which in my experience are more sensitive than the Purkinje cells. So again, it's basica lly a cascade of cellular involvement, depending on the sever ity and the length of the insult. -149-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 149 of 177Tr. 6 at 1511- 12. Contradicting the insistent claim of Dr. Shane, Dr. Rorke-A dams stated that it would be impossibl e to distinguish karyorrhe xis (cell nucleu s disintegration cause d by \"some kind of nuclea r disintegr ation) using only the H and E stain employ ed in fixing the brain sli des in this case. Tr. 6 at 1512. She said that there is a specia l stain technique that would need to be used to identify karyorrhe xis with particularity , as distinguished f rom normal apoptosis. Tr. 6 a t 1512-13. Summi ng up somewhat, Dr. Rorke-A dams stated that there was nothing in her patholog ical revie w of Thomas' case that indicated \" chang es due to a chronic proce ss going on prior to the night of Thomas Kolakowski's death.\" Tr. 6 at 1513. Nothing in her patholog ical review suggested \"abnor mal chang es which would have ta ken more than a f ew hour s to occur .\" Id. Nothing in her patholog ical revie w was, taken individually or in conce rt with other finding s, \" would be diagnostic of merc ury toxicity.\" Tr. 6 at 1514. In fact, the only toxicity of any kind that she thought the evidenc e supported w as tox icity from \"la ck of oxy gen.\" Id. She conclude d her direc t testimony by stating the four points that she believed most strong ly milit ated for a diagnosis of acute anox ic encephalopa thy. Tr. 6 at 1516-17. The scular hemorrha she views as the effect of the proce ss of autore gulation she had descr ibed, in which blood vessels dilate \"which are not normally carrying the blood,\" and wher e \" the heart function has anteda ted the problems\" in the brain. Tr. 6 at 1517-18. This cause s the circulation of blood to slow below normal levels, which indicates to the patholog ist a problem in the circulatory system. Tr. 6 at 1518. \"The periva scular hemorrha ges indicate that the damag e has affected some of the endothelial cells, and opened up the tight junctions that we talked about earlier, and allowed the blood to get out of the lumen of the blood vessel into167 the surrounding tissue.\" Id. The second tell-tale finding , for Dr. Rorke-A dams, is the \"swe lling of myelin sheaths, acute swelling of oligode ndrog lia, and some pyknosis of these cells, and cerebellar white matter,\"168 chang es which \"desc ribe the chang es associate d with the edema , or as a conseque nce of the edema .\" Tr. 6 at 1518- 19. She elabor ated on this point more fully : Dr. Rorke-Adams explained what she meant by the term \"acute anoxic encephalopathy\" thusly:166 It means that this is a brain that did not receive sufficient oxygen before death, and produced these changes. Encephalopathy basically is a clinical term, and pathologists never use it unless they have some defining adjectives before the word \"encephalopathy.\" Encephalopathy clinically means that there's some disturbance of higher cerebral function. What I'm saying here, and the manner in which a pathologist uses the term, is that yes, there's some brain dysfunction, and it's most likely due to lack of oxygen. And so that's the accepted term. Tr. 6 at 1517. The lumen is \"the cavity or channel within a tube or tubular organ.\" DORLAND'S, supra, at 1069.167 Pyknosis is \"a thickening, especially degeneration of a cell in which the nucleus shrinks in size and the168 chromatin condenses to a solid, at 1550. 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 150 of 177And as I indicated earlier, the excess fluid in the brain and cerebral edema can either be intra-c ellular -- that is, within the cells -- or betwee n the cells, what we call interstitial. And one of the plac es whe re the water can a ccumulate is in the my elin sheath. And even with an H&E stain, you can evalua te this. Because what happens is that the myelin sheath gets swollen, it gets sort of acculated [sic]. And that's a characteristic fea ture. The acute swelling of the oligode ndrog lia, as I said, is the reactive feature of the oligode ndrocy tes under the se circ umstances. And the oligode ndrocy tes, which a re normally just a little dark nucleus that are a little bit larger than those internal granula r cells that we looked at, then acquir e a little halo around them that looks like a fried egg. So you can recognize that, and sometimes you can see some little pinkish materia l surrounding the nucleus. Some of these, the reaction can produce damag e to the cell, to the point where the nucleus then disintegr ates, and the word pyknosis refers to the damag e to the nucleus of these oligode ndrocy tes because of their involvement in this edema . And I saw that in both the cer ebral white matter a nd the ce rebellar white matter . Tr. 6 at 1519-20. In conjunction with this point, Dr. Rorke-A dams voiced her disag reement with Dr. Shane's stated opinion that swelling of the oligode ndrog lia was \"not a finding [he] would to diagnose hypoxic ischemia, because the oligode ndrog lia took longe r to react, which would require \"a very, very long proce ss of hypoxia ischemia,\" and would be inconsistent with an acute hypoxic- ischemic event. Tr. 6 at 1520, citing Tr. 3 at 686. In contra distinction, it was Dr. Rorke-A dams' opinion that \" hypoxia ischemia w ill provoke ede ma, so the edema then will lea d to acute swelling of the oligode ndrog lial cells in reaction to that proce ss ... a fairly rapid proce ss.\" Tr. 6 at 1521. She added that by fairly rapid, she thought that it would only take a few hours for that finding to become evident. Id. Her third diagnostic criter ion was the \"acute neurona l necrosis of cerebral corte x, espec ially in layer 2 in one section, corpus striatum and brainstem,\" which she viewed as \"the neurons in various parts of the brain [] underg oing necrosis because of the lack of oxygen.\" Tr. 6 at 1522. Her fourth finding which she believed to be diagnostic of hypoxic ischemia was t hat the Purkinje cel l layer had separ ated from the molecular layer and the internal granula r layer, even while both granula r layers, e xterna l and int ernal, and P urkinje cells, [were] within normal l imits .\" Tr. 6 at 1522. S he viewed this finding as \"quite striking\" as \"an artifa ct that we oftentimes see in baby brains, particula rly if they 're swollen and ha ve these hypoxic cha nges.\" Tr . 6 at 1522. Looking at Thomas' case from a \"global perspe ctive,\" albeit from her expertise as a pediatric neuropa thologist, Dr. Rorke-A dams said she did not see anything that would suggest Thomas Kolakowski's death was cause d by anything other than hypoxic, ischemic injury . Tr. 6 at 1522-23. When asked if she would characterize her finding s as mere ly consistent with, or diagnostic of hypoxic, ischemic injury , Dr. Rorke-A dams responde d that they were \"certainly\" consistent, and that there was nothi ng in the rec ord to lead to an alterna te, competing conclusion given t he pathologic data and the medical records. Tr. 6 at 1522-23. She added that, \"this case taken as a whole is quite consistent with hypoxia ischemia seconda ry to fit -151-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 151 of 177in with the history of the co-slee ping,\" a diagnosis she is \"very familiar with,\" which she makes \"all the time at the Medical Examiner' s office .\" Tr. 6 at 1523. Reg arding the mecha nism of hy poxia, she maintained that the source of the hypoxia was external, and was not \"somehow metabolic, or from within the body ,\" adding that there was \"no indication of any metabolic disorder or some other disease sta te.\" Id. In her mind, the Hepa titis B vaccinations had no \"causative role in the death of Thomas Kolakowski.\" Tr. 6 1523-24. In her perspe ctive, \"the hypoxic ischemic by a preponde rance of the evidenc e, the cause of the death of this child,\" that \"more likely than not, by a preponde rance of the evidenc e, that was brough t about by asphy xia,\" and that the mecha nism of the asphy xia is a sepa rate issue. Tr. 6 at 1524. On cross-e xamination, Dr. Rorke-A dams admitted that she could not approximate with any precision when Thomas Kolakowski died, and did not engage an invitation from Petitioners to estimate the time of de ath base d on body tempera ture a t the hospital. Tr. 6 at 1525-26. To do so, she opined, was a \"very tricky business\" that was \"actually the realm of forensic patholog ists,\" and that, even in her capacity as a forensic neuropa thologist, she is not called upon to perform that analy sis. Tr. 6 at 1526. She added later, when Petitioners raised the subject again, that \"the rules169 are very difficult , because there are many , many factors that have to be taken into considera tion[ , a]nd the bottom line in the forensic patholog y textbooks is that it's a very unclea r, unscientific kind of problem, and there 's no way that you can really be certain.\" Tr. 6 at 1561-62. Another area upon which she admitted she was unqualified to opine was in answe ring the question whether persistent cardiac electrical activity was \"consistent with a death that occur red two hours earlier.\" Tr. 6 at 1528. When asked how she knew that Thomas Kolakowski had not die d from merc ury toxicity if she had not re ad much of the tox icolog y literature filed in this matter, she re plied: Well, I'm familiar with merc ury intox ication and what it does to the nervous system. I didn't revie w the [num erous article s], but I certainly have a knowledg e of merc ury intox ication. There is a very fascinating book that was written about the contamination of the Minamata Bay in Japan. I have a copy of that book. I've read it, I've read the textbooks. I deal with toxicolog y in the course of my work, so I have a general knowledg e of w hat merc ury does to the bra in. Tr. 6 at 1528- 29. Dr. Rorke-Adams added further explanation on this point as follows:169 [T]here are many, many different factors that are involved in using body temperature as a determination of time of death, one of which is the ambient temperature. Another factor is what was the temperature of the individual before he died. The third one is the amount of clothing on the individual. So there are many, many things. And in my reading of the forensic textbooks dealing with this issue, the bottom line is that it's a very risky business to try to be specific in terms of those, relating one to the other. Tr. 6 at 1526-27. She added, when asked, that Dr. Gilbert-Barness is a pediatric pathologist and Dr. Rorke-Adams was unaware of \"how much forensic work she's done.\" Tr. 6 at 1527. -152-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 152 of 177Petitioners' next line of questioning challeng ed Dr. Rorke-A dams on the clinical symptoms that would be expected in a case of mercury toxicity, and how those might be identified in a newbor n. The first discussed was cerebellar ataxia, a motor imbalance and lack of coordina tion that makes for imbalance d walking and unsteady , shaky movement of the arms and hands, which Dr. Rorke-Ad ams would not apply to Thomas since he was so young , and not mobile or develope d enoug h to note a chang e. Tr. 6 at 1529. Another indicium would be subjectively -felt anxiety , which would be difficult to discern with any specific ity or obj ectivity in so y oung an infant, only to note excessive crying and derive anxiety there from. Tr. 6 at 1531. The same difficulty in objective observa tion is even more prese nt with the indicia of visual dysfunction, persona lity chang es, memory loss, and dementia. Tr. 6 at 1531-32. Motor and sensory motor neuropathy could be measure d clinically throug h a neurolog ical examination to deter mine difficulty in moving extremiti es or sensory loss (e.g., a pin-prick test). Id. The rema ining indicium was tremors, which were never clinically descr ibed by a medical profe ssional, but was the term used by Thomas' mother in her affidavits to descr ibe a physical phenomenon she claims to have witnessed in Thomas during his brief terrestrial sojourn. Tr. 6 at 1530. Dr. Rorke-A dams made sure to point out that there was \"no indication of the pediatric ian being told that the baby had tremors,\" and that \"in the hospital records, the mother said that the baby only had a head cold, and nothing else was going on ... she didn't say anything about tremors there .\" Id, citing Pet. Ex. 5 at 4. Dr. Rorke-A dams did conce de that the mention of tremors was made \"repeatedly\" in Mrs. Kolakowski's affidavits, composed in prepa ration for this litigation. Tr. 6 a t 1530. Later, Dr. Rorke-A dams was called on again to discuss the term \"tremors\" that was mentioned in Mrs. Kolakowski's second affidavit, which soug ht to descr ibe the actua l physical phenomenon that she referred to by that term. Tr. 6 at 1556. Groupe d in with the mention of tremors was what Mrs. Kolakowski perceived as a weak or nonexis tent startle reflect in Thomas, which Dr. Rorke-A dams conce ded could be a neurolog ical sign, befor e noting that she was not a pediatric neurolog ist, and could not there fore opine with particula rity on what was a normal startle reflex at five weeks old. Id. Dr. Rorke-A dams rema ined quizz ical about the affidavit reference \"body because tremors \"are usually in an extremity ,\" wher eas \"if the whole body is moving, then I would interpre t that to be that the child is having a seizure ... I've never heard of body tremors.\" Tr. 6 at 1557. She did agree that such symptoms could be neurolog ical. Id. A little later, Petitioners r eturne d again to the affidavit a bout tr emors, which descr ibes them as \"episode s wher e his body would stiffen, and then the involuntary movements would begin,\" lasting a few minutes time, adding that, when Mrs. Kolakowski would try to comfort Thomas during these episodes, \"the trembling would continue, and stop when it had run its course .\" Tr. 6 at 1560-61. Dr. Rorke-A dams reiter ated that, to her , this phenomenon sounded \"mor e like a se izure.\" Tr. 6 a t 1561. The next topic of cross-e xamination delved deepe r into Dr. Rorke-A dams' prior of autore gulation, with Petitioners asking whether the stressor of hypoxia is what triggers the autore gulation, Dr. Rorke -Ada ms responded: The hy poxia is the first thing to oc cur. And the heart needs blood, just as the bra in needs blood. So the biochemica l effect in the brain is to open up the blood vessels. But if the heart doesn't get adequa te blood, then it can't pump efficiently to incre ase the blood flow. And its structure , its muscle cells are also not getting sufficie nt -153-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 153 of 177blood, so that the effectivene ss of the heart is diminis hed, because it's also compromised. Tr. 6 at 1533-34. As to how long this proce ss would take to transpire , Dr. Rorke-A dams stated that it would depend on how sever e was the hypoxia. Tr. 6 at 1534. When presse d to estimate how long the proc ess took in this case, Dr . Rorke-A dams replied: I can't give you a specific time, but it probably took place over a period of time, because this wa sn't somebody clapping their hands over his face and cutting off all of his oxygen. It was probably a partial interfe rence with his ability to breathe. And so ag ain, it would be pure ly a matter of spec ulation. Tr. 6 at 1534. Dr. Rorke-A dams said it was not specula tion to say that Thomas' airwa y was partially , not completely obstructed, because if his airwa y had been completely obstructed, she \"would expect him to die immediately , and then we wouldn't see any of these chang es,\" which \"take a while\" to develop. Id. Over all, howeve r, she stressed that the actua l duration could only be estimated as a varia ble if the degree of hypoxic obstruction was a known quantity , but tha t if both w ere unknown variables, neither could be estimated with any specific ity. Tr. 6 at 1535. It certainly could have taken place completely within the four hours betwee n when Thomas fell aslee p and when he was discovere d, but she dec lined to narrow her e stimate more pre cisely . Id. Next, Dr. Rorke-Ada ms was asked t o identify any patholog ical findings i n the hea rt tissue that heralded i schemia, to which she answe red that no specia l staining proc edure s or ana lysis was done on autopsy , and that she could not rende r an opinion on that question since it had been so long since she had performed cardiac patholog y 45 years previous, such that her cardiac patholog y knowledg e was not up-to-d ate. Tr. 6 at 1535-36. Asked whether cardiac arrest could antec ede anoxic, ischemic injury , Dr. Rorke-A dams agreed that it could, but that sever al of the finding s prese nt in this case would not be prese nt, be cause , \"If the heart stops beating just suddenly and the individual dies, you don't see any thing any place in the orga ns of the body , including the brain. It takes a while for the patholog ical features to develop.\" Tr. 6 at 1537. When asked whether a slow degradation of heart function could lead to hy poxic ischemia, D r. Rorke- Adams descr ibed what is referred to as \"near- miss SIDS\" as the situation wher e \"a baby [] stops breathing and whose heart stops, but somebody is there ,\" and the baby is resusc itated, but who never regains consciousness and ultimately expires. Tr. 6 at 1537-38. She said that in those ca ses, the histologic al cha nges within the brain are observa ble on autopsy , because there was time for those proce sses to transpire , wher eas in a shorter time frame , they are not. Tr. 6 at 1538. Dr. Rorke-A dams again voiced her disag reement with Dr. Shane, regarding whethe r the myocardium de monstrated patholog ical chang es, when she stated that \"[t]here were no chang es in the myocardium,\" not even a ny chang es cause d by the hypoxia she postulated. Tr. 6 at 1538. She did agree with Dr. Shane that the brain showed evidenc e of cerebral edema upon microscopic examination, saying that she observe d such evidenc e on most of the brain slides. Tr. 6 at 1539-40. She also disag reed with Dr. Shane a bout the evidenc e of the chronic patholog ical process t hat Dr. Shane descr ibed. She said that an ongoing inflammatory reaction in the brain would cause pyknosis. Tr. 6 at 1541. When Petitioners asked whether she would expect to find microg lial activation if the brain wa s underg oing a n inflammatory reaction, she qualified: -154-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 154 of 177Depe nds on the time and the extent. One of the peculiar things about hypoxic ischemic injury in the brain is that you can have widespre ad disintegr ation of the cells, and very little in the way of any kind of inflammatory reaction whatsoeve r. I've never heard anybody give a proper explanation for this. I don't know why that's the case, but that's what we observe . So the reaction to the cell death basica lly is not on the part of the inflammatory cells, but it usually comes after the cells have died and the astrocy tes come in to, and some of the microg lia will come in to take care of the re moval of the de ad ce lls and the prese nce of the sca r, or f orm the sca r. Tr. 6 at 1541-42. She stipulated that \"sometimes Tr. 6 at 1542. On the same general point, Dr. Rorke-Adams clarified an issue of classifica tion. When asked by Petitioners whether the term gliosis would include the inflammatory activation of both astrocy tes and microg lia, Dr. Rorke-A dams stated that the term refers only to astroc ytes, and that the microg lia are separ ate. Tr. 6 at 1542-43. Dr. Rorke-A dams stated that neurona l necrosis takes \"an hour or two\" in order \"to appea r after a hypoxic ischemic event,\" but that did not mean that she would expect the appea rance of microg lia \"[w]i thin a couple of hours.\" Tr. 6 at 1543-44. She explained that, most commonly , \"you can have a tremendous amount of neurona l necrosis and not see very much micro glia at all.\" Tr. 6 at 1544. When Petitioners tried t o analog ize microg lia to the macr ophag es within the bl oodstream, as they are macr ophag centr al nervous Rorke -Ada ms was careful to disting uish that they are differ ent in important respe cts: Well, again, the centr al nervous system is unusual, and you can't compar e it with another organ of the body , because you have a differ ent cell population. And unless you have some kind of an infec tious agent, you don't get the same kind of inflammatory chang es in quite the precise way in the brain that you do in another organ of the body . If you have some kind of injury , you have the outpouring of chemica l substances called cytokines, which stimul ate the activa tion of certain reactive cells. But when you look at the sections, you don't see all of the various cell types in the brain that you would see in the liver, or the lungs, or the spleen, or whateve r. It's a differ ent kind of a histo logical reaction. [I]n most of the acute anoxic encepha lopathies that I see, the re's not much of a r eaction at all in the ear ly stage. You see the cell underg oing the necrosis, the pyknosis, the karyorrhe xis. And then they just kind of disappea r. That's another peculiar phenomenon that I've never been able to understand. Then eventua lly, once the cells have disappea red, you start seeing the activation of the astrocy tes from the histologic point of view, and you see the g liosis. Tr. 6 at 1545- 46. Next, the cross-examination turned to the interpre tation of the Purkinje cells, and the separ ation Dr. Rorke-A cell-la yer separ ation as \"a finding that's very common in the baby , that we see in the baby brain when there is edema ,\" but added that it was seen by her as an exagg erated artifa ct, \"an edema tous brain.\" Tr. 6 at 1549. In plain terms, the brain tissue, espec ially of an infant, tears when it is dehy drate d in formaldehy de, but ty pically does so in a predic table pattern, to a predic table degree; -155-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 155 of 177when the tear is more sever e, it is evidenc e of greater fluid content, as in the case of edema . In this, she wa s in ag reement with Dr. Shane: Well, the dehy dration is from the dehy dration that is produce d by the formalde hyde. So it remove s the water from the tissue, and it accentuates the space s. For example, in Dr. Shane's repor t he talks about perine ural and periva scular halos. That's all because of the shrinkag e artifact . And the more swelling you have, the more drama tic those things are.... It's accentuated in cerebral edema , but it can be just an artifa ct unassocia ted with edema in a baby brain. Tr. 6 at 1550. The next phase of cross-e xamination showed that Dr. Rorke-A dams possessed the erroneous understanding that either ethyl or methy l merc ury were inorg anic, when actually they are both organic forms of merc ury. Tr. 6 at 1551-52. When asked to discuss the differ ences in organic and inorg anic forms of merc ury, in the relative harm they can cause , Dr. Rorke-A dams replied that the source she had read on merc ury toxicity noted that they cause differ ent neurotoxicity , but that in other contexts they were lumped together. Tr. 6 at 1552-53. As pointed out by Respondent's objection at that point, that topic is toxicolog ic, not neuropa thologic, and, while it did demonstrate an error on Dr. Rorke-A dams' part, it did not vitiate her probative weight in the Court's mind, because she se emed ve ry competent on the topic f or which she was off ered: neuropa thology . Dr. Rorke-A Dr. Shane conce rning the blood-brain barrier, in that she believed it was \"intact at the time of birth,\" even though \"it allowed for the movement of various proteins in the baby brain, wher eas the blood-brain barrier doesn't allow that in the adults.\" Tr. 6 a t 1554-55. Petitioners circled back around to asking Dr. Rorke-A dams about the clinical record, to deter mine if any of the symptoms recorded were neurolog ical, or at least potentially so. Dr. Rorke- Adams said in response to the symptoms raised (reluc tance to sleep or nurse, passivity , insomnia, anore xia, the \"tr emors\" a nd the putatively muted startle re flex) that they could be neurolog ical, or they could be related to many other things, because they were mostly nonspecific . Tr. 6 at 1558-59. Dr. Rorke -Ada ms also responded by reference to wha t is absent from the medic al records: [I]f you go back to the Exhibit 5, wher e she's giving a history when the child comes into the hospital essentially dead, she says, \"Mom says child had a head cold and nothing else going on.\" So if she was so worrie d about these thing s, I should think she would have told the doctors in the hospital when her child is in serious condition that, you know, I noticed all these terrible things happening . But there 's no indication of that. Tr. 6 at 1559. Getting back to the centr al issue of proxi mate causa tion, Petitioners asked hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy was cause d only by asphy xia, to which Dr. Rorke-A dams replied that, of course , there are other potential cause s for a lack of air, such as when suffe ring from shock or other disorders, including pulmonary edema . Tr. 6 at 1563. Petitioners then asked estive heart -156-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 156 of 177failure was somewhat analog ous to pulmonary edema , which moved beyond the topic area of neuropa thology . Id. Dr. Rorke-A dams stipulated that is oftentimes a conseque nce of cong estive heart failure ,\" which, if it were sufficie ntly sever e, could lead to a hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy . Id. Howeve r, in this case, Dr. Rorke-Adams did not see any chronic abnorma l finding s, only acute ones. Id. And although the term acute can mean anything occur ring within a one- or two-day span, in this case there was a very brief time interval-four hours or less, because if it had extended earlier, bey ond the four-hour period in the early morning hours of 25 Januar y 1999, Thomas would have manifested much more signific ant clinical symptoms. Tr. 6 at 1563, 1569-71. Also, Dr. Rorke-A dams stated that ss(es) she descr ibed could all transpire within a four hour interval. Tr . 6 at 1564. Finally , on redire ct examination, Dr. Rorke-A dams clarified that she did not believe that pulmonary edema precipitated the hypoxic ischemic injury as a first cause , but was a concur rent finding from a simil ar first cause of whateve r mecha nism (physical, not metabolic) cause d hypoxia. Tr. 6 at 1564- 65. She explained why : Well, becau se there was not isolated pulmonary edema in this case. There was evidenc e of pleura l effusion, which refer s to fluid in both sides of the ch est cavity , which is a sign of, or it can be one of the signs of heart failure. There was sever e cong estion in the various organs, and a pulmonary edema was simply one aspec t of the fa iling hea rt. So we had a combination of finding s. Tr. 6 at 1565. Likewise, when asked if she had seen any evidenc e of cong estive heart failure in the microscopic slides, the a utopsy 's gross finding s, or in the clinical r ecords, she answe red: [T]he bilatera l pleura l effusions are a characteristic, can be a characteristic feature of cong estive hea rt failure . The he avy organs, the lungs, w ell, the normal we ight that one would expect for a five-w eek-old is 68 grams; this baby 's lungs were 180 grams, which is quite an increase. The liver was incre ased in weig ht. The spleen was almost double the size. All of these are signs of cong estive heart failure [from a hypoxic injury ]. Tr. 6 at 1565-66. This led the Court to press Dr. Rorke-A dams on sequenc e of causa tion and events: THE COURT: Can one say which came first? In other words, could y ou have ha d the cong estive heart failure that led to the pulmonary edema , to the oxygen depriva tion, a nd there fore to a hypoxic ischemic injury ? Or would you have to say the hypoxic ischemic injury came first that broug ht about pulmonary edema and heart failure ? Or c an one sa y that? THE WITNESS: I think in thi s case , the hypoxia ischemia produce d simult aneous damag e to the heart and the brain because of the lack of oxygen. What happene d was that the lack of oxygen produce d the heart failure , which started to work on the brain. And also, as it continued, it led to the obvious manifestations of the pulmonary edema , the pleura l of the viscera l organs. THE COURT: And upon what can you base your conclu sions that the hypoxic ischemic injury occur red first, bring ing about the pulmonary edema and the cardiac -157-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 157 of 177arrest; rathe r than the cardia c arrest bring ing a bout the pulmonary edema , and then the hy poxic ischemic injury ? THE W ITNESS: Well, we don't have any primary cardiac dis ease to explain why the heart isn't function ing proper ly. So that something had to produce some inadequa cy of the heart to function as it should, to lead to generalized ischemia that would affect the brain, and then the continued functioning of the heart. And then the pulmonary edema and the e ffusions would be a conseque nce of the fa iling hea rt. Tr. 6 at 1566- 67. Respondent asked Dr. Rorke-A dams to put this case's diagnosis in context of her experience : Q How many autopsies have you done in which you diagnosed the cause of death a s hypoxic ischemia? A Oh, seve ral thousand. Q Okay . Is there anything about the Thomas Kolakowski case that distinguishes it diagnostica lly from those other case s? A No. Tr. 6 at 1567. Lastly, the C ourt asked Dr. R orke-Adams some clarifying questions regarding her offer ed opinion: THE COURT: Okay ... What the Court wants is to be certain that it understands your perspectives in the delineation of what occur red. And are you saying that the cong estive heart failure and the pulmonary ... edema , were precipitating cause s to the hypoxic ischemic injury ? Or that they were deriva tive from the hypoxic ischemic injury , and par t of the ag onal proc ess? If you can sa y. THE W ITNESS: They were derivative t o the hy poxia ischemia. And t he chang es that we saw occur red simult aneously affecting the heart first, and then the brain. And then the failure of the heart led to the pulmonary edema and the effusions, the pleura l effusions, and the cong estion in the viscera l organs. THE COURT: Okay. But am I to understand, then, that the hypoxic ischemic is what cause d the other items? In other words, the cong estive heart failure presumably cause d the pulmonary collapse? Or not? THE WI TNESS: Yes. The stimul us for -- the whole proce ss be gan bec ause of the hypoxia.... The hypoxia then cause d the cardiac insufficienc y and the brain damag e, and the c ardia c insuffic iency cause d the pulmonary and visce ral chang es. THE COURT: So from your perspe ctive, it would be fair to say that the cong estive heart failure a nd pulmonary issues are part of the agonal proc ess? THE WI TNESS: W COURT: minal proce ss. -158-Case of 177THE WI TNESS: Yes. THE COURT: ischemic injury . TNESS: That's corr ect. Tr. 6 at 1572- 73. 8. Additional Testimony of Dr. Shane , Dr. Rorke -Ada ms, and Dr. Gilber t-Barness Putatively as rebuttal evidenc e, at the close of Dr. Rorke-A dams' testimony, Petitioners recalled Dr. Shane to the stand. Tr. 6 at 1574. This was solely for the purpose of offering and discussing a series of glossy , color photomicrog raphs Dr. Shane took of Thomas Kolakowski's autopsy slides, at vary ing ma gnification leve ls. See, e.g., Tr. 6 at 1575- 77. Dr. Shane's purpose for this additional testimony was to dispute Respondent's experts on patholog y in the interpre tation of the slides, such as whether there were inflammatory cells in the heart or bra in, or whethe r the c erebellar g ranula r cells had \"droppe d out,\" or whether the Purkinje cells demonstrated an ongoing patholog ic proce ss. See, e.g., Tr. 6 at 1580, 1587, 1595. Later, Respondent's patholog y experts were recalled to argue that he was misreading the slides, or making much of very equivoca l indicia that were more likely attributable to the proce ss of setting the tissue to the slide. See, e.g., Tr. 6 at 1642- 43. Ultimately , the Court does not base its dec ision on thi s testimony , beca use it is ex trane ous to the Court's task. It was helpful in that the patholog y experts demonstrated more concr etely what they used to formulate their opinion, but the content and rationale of their respe ctive opinions rema ined pre cisely the same a s when they had first testified. See, e.g., Tr. 6 at 1662. Most importantly , at no point during his rebuttal testimony did Dr. Shane postulate a mecha nism for how two doses of thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines caused the sudden death of Thomas Kolakowski, or indeed, how the amount of thimerosal in vaccines received by children in these United States could cause sudden death in any infants or children. That was primary reason for the testimony taken in this matter, and that rema ined patently absent, even into this exercise of slide interpre tation. Without a framework of a theore tical mecha nism, it is ultimately irrele vant whether a handful of inflammatory cells is sufficie nt to characterize an inflammatory response , a point upon which Dr . Shane see med to be ver y focuse d. To be c lear, the Court does not e xclude suc h testimony , but did not find it probative of the ultimate issues prese nted. It was of sufficie nt relevance to be admissible, but not sufficie ntly probative to be useful to the Court's dec ision-making. -159-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 159 of 177D. P OST-HEARING SUBMISSIONS At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court order ed briefing by the parties, whose arguments are summarized here . 1. Petitioners' argument is that their ex perts' testimony satisfies t he elements sufficie ntly to prove causa tion, and their support for such argument is to repeatedly summarize the points made in the testimony : from the claim that Thomas r eceived 30 times over what would have been a safe dose, t o the purported analog y betwee n the data from the Cinca and Dahha n studies and Thomas' clinical records and patholog ical finding s. At one place in their closing brief, Petitioners argue that Thomas received, in each vaccination, thirty times \"the EPA's safety limit ,\" as if the reference dose were a \"limit\" bey ond which har m would likely result, a dubious proposition and an unpersua sive argument. 2. Petitioners cited sever al cases wher e this Court has found vaccine-re lated injuries and death following Hepa titis B vaccine, but did not cite to any which found that the relevant injury or death wa s cause d by thimerosal, which is the c entra l issue in this matter. 3. Regarding the topic of patholog y in particula r, Petitioners argue that the medical examiner and the patholog ists he consulted were dumbfounded about what cause d Thomas' death, but that their \"only suspected c ulprit\" was the H epatitis B va ccine s administered to Thomas. 4. Petitioners' arguments are rende red confusing , if not incoher ent, i n that they argue that sever al conditions and circumstances obtai n; howeve r, in tical mecha and irrele vant. Examples of this are patholog ical finding s from Dr. Shane that support myocarditis, discussions about \"QT intervals,\" or certain and Thomas Kola kowski. 5. Petitioners argue that the inflammatory reaction mentioned by Dr. Connor and Dr. Shane was immunologic in nature and origin, but Petitioners offered no evidenc e, and certainly no expert testimony , on immunologic issues bea ring on this matter. 6. Respondent's primary argument is that Petitioners failed to carry their burden of proof on both the can-it and did-it portions of proving causa tion-that \"Petitioners have failed to offer reliable scientific evidenc e to support their claim that ethyl merc ury, in the amou nts contained in two Hepa titis B vaccinations, can cause merc ury toxicity, adver se cardiac effects, immune dysfunction, or sudden death,\" and \"have failed to offer reliable scientific evidenc e that the Hepa titis B vaccine cause d or contributed to the de ath of Thomas K olakowski.\" 7. Respondent argues that, assuming that Petitioners have failed to carry their burden of proof on causa tion, \"Respondent, there fore, bears no burden in establishing an alterna tive cause of death,\" althoug h, Respondent argues, the evidenc e does preponde rate to a finding that \"Thomas died as the re sult of accidental asphy xiation.\" Filed 11/23/10 Page 160 of 177de Bazan v. Sec'y of HHS opinion as support for using alternative causation evidenc e both as170 challeng e Petitioners' proof during Petitioners' ca se in chief . 8. Respondent argues that Petitioners' relianc e on the filed medical literature is too attenuate d, either because of the form of merc ury studied, or the dosages involved. Respondent argues that the only support for Petit ioner's arg ument is the (sci entifically unreliable ) opinions of Petitioners' experts, which t hemselves are founded only in the ipse dixit of those same experts, or one anothe r. II. ULTIMATE FINDINGS OF FACT The Court's task now is to analy ze the differ ences betwee n the opinions offered to deter mine whether Petitioner has established a plausible theory of medical causa tion and a logic al sequenc e of cause and effect, having occur red in a medically appropr iate time frame, which is biologica lly plausible to tie together the factual sequenc e and explain Petitioner's injury . See Althen v. Sec'y of HHS , 418 F. 3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ; Pafford v . Sec'y of HHS, 451 F. 3d 1352, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2006), rehearing and rehearing en banc denied , (Oct. 24, 2006), cert. den., 168 L. Ed. 2d 242, 75 U.S.L .W. 3644 (2007); Walther v. Sec'y of HHS , F. 1146 ( Fed. 2007); de 539 F. 3d 1347, 1352 ( Fed. Cir. the Court assesses the relative probative weig ht of each party 's ex pert witnesses, it should first assess the weig ht assig ned to the \"tremors\" descr ibed by Mrs. Kolakowski. This Court has alway s been retice nt to supplant medical records with a mere testimonial affidavit, espec ially given the weig ht afforded medical records and the statutory command that a petitioner may not preva il based solely upon his own claims, without further support. Here the medical records are not only silent upon the matters averred to in the affidavits, the two are at odds. Wherea s Mrs. Kolakowski repor ts that Thomas' startle reflex never proper ly develope d, more that one medical record repor ts that it was patent and observe d befor e Thomas was discharg ed from the hospital following birth. She repor ted the prese nce of tremors from the day of the first administration of Hepatitis B vaccine, Thomas' second day of life, but was spotty in her descr iption of what she witnessed. When order ed by the Court to fill in the details of what she saw, what she saw was most likely not tremors at all, a point made most tellingly by Petitioners' own pediatric neurolog ist, who downg raded the of Dr. Rorke-A a neuropa thologist, opinion. Most signific antly , though, the affidavits' mention of tremors that began the very same day as the first Hepa titis B 539 F. 3d 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Respondent quoted the relevant section of that opinion:170 The government, like any defendant, is permitted to offer evidence to demonstrate the inadequacy of the petitioner's evidence on a requisite element of the petitioner's case-in-chief. [de] Bazan has identified no statute, regulation, or precedent that indicates that the special master is required to only consider the petitioner's evidence as to whether the vaccine was a cause-in-fact. 539 F. 3d at 1353. -161-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 161 of 177vaccination-while Thomas was still in the hospital following birth-is belied by medical records that same day specific ally stating that there were not tremors prese nt or observa ble. Also, for symptoms so sever e that Mrs. Kolakowski could not rouse Thomas from their effects, the medical records do not reflect complaints of such phenomena in their recorded history , and the histories taken were not perfunctory or cursor y. The Court is left to conclude that whateve r Mrs. Kolakowski referred to by her use of the ter m \"tremors\" was not medica lly relevant or intellig ible for the Court's dec ision in this case. As stated supra at 3-4, medical records in pursuit of treatment enjoy a weig hty deference by the Court. Where medical records are silent or ambig uous, fact witness testimony may certainly be useful in filling in mar ginal details. Also, in the rare event that the medica l records display patent errors, or are otherwise contra dictory , fact witness testimony that is clear, cogent, and consistent may overc ome discrepa ncies there in. N one of those conditions obta in he re, and the medical records as they are written are acce pted as accurate , fact witness testimony notwithstanding. Any e171 upon the so-ca lled tremors is unper suasive, and unsuppor ted by the fa ctual re cord. Mov ing on to the medical issues prese nted, the Court will assess each medical area separ ately , then as a whole. The Court beg ins with the tox icolog y issues. The issue prese nted by the toxicolog y evidenc e revolve s around dosag e, that the amount of ethyl mercur y contained w ithin the infant immuni zation reg imen, and two He patitis B vac cines in particula r, have enoug h merc ury to cause adver se outcomes-and ultimately death in particula r. Dr. Lucier 's testimony was interesting , but its focus was on the regulatory decision-making that uses safety factors wher e scientific knowledg e is spotty or absent. Dr. Lucier 's testimony contained errors in basic scientific calculation, and he argued by analog y beyond the point of attenu ation. His testimony was not base d on the m edica l literature as a whole, but g raspe d onto isolated fra gments as prooftexts to prove what no scientific study has: that the amount of merc ury in thimerosal- containing vacc ines is dang erous, let a lone dea dly. A large part of the problem running as a current throug hout a ll of Dr. Lucier 's testimony is application of regulatory criter ia to the realm of general and specific causation, the Court's focus herein. orthog onal approa ch arises from the fact that he is a toxicolog ist, not a medical toxicolog ist. He is an expert on chemica l properties and proce sses, not a n expert on the effects of those chemica ls in the hum an body , or the treatment there for. Beyond the m atter of his educa tiona l expertise, his profe ssional experience has focuse d on measuring biologic effects in relation to the dose of chemica l exposure. He has not really studied physiologic effects in humans, and in his experience overse eing the regulatory reference dose, he and his regulatory coter ie assumed the relationship measure d by the Faroe Island researchers in calculating a reference dose for methy l merc ury. In that pursuit, wher e scienc e did not provide an answe r, the regulators (for perfectly good reasons!) assumed relationships and quantitative values beyond what any data provided. As Dr. Respondent's argument is well-taken that \"The Vaccine Act does not permit a special master to make171 findings 'based on the claims of a petitioner alone, unsubstantiated by medical records or by medical opinion'\" (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-13(a)(1)). -162-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 162 of 177Brent pointed out, however, what is good practice for regulators does not make a conclusion scientifica lly valid or evidenc e-based if the question is determining cause and effect relationships. Another simil ar problem with Dr. Lucier 's testimony , and one that is probably a result of his not being a medical toxicolog ist, is that he never makes any toxicolog ic associations regarding a mecha nism wher eby ethyl merc ury cause s harm by physiologic proce sses. His discussion amounted to a roundtable discussion of merc ury's proper ties and forms as a general question, which possessed only tangential relevance to the questions prese nted by the case at hand. At best, Petitioners are left with extrapolating medical conclusions from his testimony , because none of his testimony that was based on substantive proofs was relevant t o the questi on of ca usation, and wha t statements he did make on the question of causa tion were conclusory and unsupported by the evidenc e. A rathe r damning example of this problem was that Dr. Lucier never even undertook the analy sis of whether , from a toxicolog ical standpoint, the ethyl merc ury contained in two Hepa titis B vaccines actua lly did cause the injury to and death of Thomas Kolakowski. Even if Petitioners were to provide a nuance d argument to connec t Dr. Lucier 's meande ring musings to cardiologic or patholog ic evidenc e, so as to provide a toxicolog ic basis for general (\"can it\") causa tion, there is still entirely missing from the record any opinion from the area of toxicolog y that addre sses specific (\"did it\") causa conf usion, tha t appare ntly confuse d Petitioners in their brief, conce rns the safety reference dose. This dose is an amount of the substance which, if no more than that amount is consumed daily (on average), adver se outcomes are all but certain to be avoided. In every instance, it assumes a value from the most sensitive data points recorded, and adds order s of magnitude whene ver there is an ambig uity. Suffice it to say that it is a logic al fallac y (\"affirma tive conclusion from a negative premise\" ) to use the following statement: \"IF the reference dose of methy l merc ury is not exceede d in average daily consumption, THEN no adverse outcomes will result,\" in order to conclude throug h reformulation that \"IF an amount of ethyl merc ury over the reference dose of methyl merc ury is consumed on t wo separate day s of a series, but not every day or in very large amounts, THEN adver se outcomes will result.\" Aside from this obvious fallac y, there is also prese nt in that formulation the \"quantifie r-shift fallac y\" of attributing to ethyl merc ury the precise characteristics of methy l merc ury, merc ury chloride, or elementa l merc ury: Even if ethyl merc ury is a form of merc ury (which in some dosag e is toxic or lethal, depending on its form), and share s characteristics with all forms or merc ury (most of all methy l merc ury as another organomer curia l), it does not logic ally follow, as a deduc tive exercise, that ethyl merc ury share s every characteristic of the others. If it does not, then part of provi ng that ethyl merc ury damag es infants would include an inductive course of deter mining exactly what ethyl merc ury is capable of, and its precise characteristics as a substance. It is improper even to be gin from the same reference dose as methy l merc ury, for that matter. Dr. Lucier subjectively weig hed attributes that are qualitatively , not just quantitatively , distinct, in order to arrive at his judgment that ethy l merc ury is just as toxic as methy l merc ury. The Court does not accept such a premise as proven, without some objective standard to assess his balancing of toxicity factors. Moreove r, that opinion is not corroborate d by the medical literature filed in this case. Dr. Lucier admitted as much when he said that regulatory agencies, in the interest of efficiency , will study chemica l groups instead of individual chemica ls, and their practice in doing so is to pick the most toxi c of the group to study , and assig n a reference dose. Noticea bly, not one of the regulatory agencie s discussed herein ever thought to -163-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 163 of 177study ethyl merc ury for this purpose instead of methy l merc ury. Despite this, Dr. Lucier 's opinion conc erning the toxicity of ethyl merc ury in thimerosal was based throug hout on the supposition either tha t ethy l mercur y was the sa me as methy l mercur y, or that it was eve n more toxi c. To be clear, the medical literature provided herein establishes t hat the orga nic ethy l group that gives ethyl mercury its na me is easier to strip f rom the merc ury atom than is the methy l group that is methy l merc ury's namesa ke. Petitioners' main argument for the premise that ethyl merc ury proves to be mor e toxi c is that, since it is dee thylated ea sier, and the refore more readily conver ted to leave inorg anic merc ury (merc ury chloride, the inorg anic merc ury salt) as an end-pr oduct, it has the potential for more damag e because inorg anic merc ury is difficult or impossibl e to eradicate from the body , and the brain in particula r. That argument would be most persua sive if the facts involved a prolong ed exposure, because if blood levels were kept regular or constant at a high level, the amount of ethyl merc ury available to deethy late would be sufficie nt to populate the body (and ultimately , we are to assume, the brain) with inorg anic merc ury, above the conver sion rate of methy l merc ury. Howeve r, that is surely not the case. The Burbache r data make abundantly clear that ethyl merc ury is eliminated from the bloodstream very quickly, espec ially when compar ed to methy l merc ury. If ethyl merc ury is consumed in light to modera te (non-letha l) doses, the medical literature preponde rates to a conclusion that the body could eliminate it befor e it could be metaboliz ed and deethy lated into inorg anic merc ury. In contra st, methy l merc ury is much more persistent in the blood. This is another reason why it is improper to use the reference dose of methy l merc ury-a substance that long persists in the bloodstream-as the reference dose for ethyl merc ury, which is quite differ ent in that reg ard. 172 Of course , all of this discussion is quite extraneous to the fact that Dr. Lucier never postulated a toxicolog ic theory by which the dosag e of ethyl merc ury in vaccines could cause toxicity or sub-tox ic effects. That was the primary reason for calling him to the stand, and on that point, his testimony was a bjectly wanting . In contra st, Dr. B rent wa s a medica l toxicolog ist, and his ex pertise not only permitted him to discuss the effects of toxic chemica ls, it allowed him to state what effects would correspond with a given dosag e of a particula r chemical. He pointed out the scientific invalidity of using the reference dose of methy l merc ury to assess the threa t of harm from ethyl merc ury in thimerosal- containing vaccines. Dr. Brent was insistent that the differ ences betwee n ethyl and methy l merc ury were stark and qualitative, such that the qualities of one could not be assumed for the other. He pointed out tha t the ref erence dose is based on a da ily aver age, not a maximum daily amount for a single dose. He also pointed out the possible distortions that might result from using data from only the most adver sely-affected children who had been prena tally exposed to methy l merc ury as a basis for setting a safe level for children and adults, espec ially when the primary point of distinction betwee n that population and a population without any measura ble adver se effects (despite a simil arly high consumption of methy l merc ury) was a confounding factor of PCBs in the former group's Based in part on this rationale, the Burbacher study concluded that the reference dose for methyl mercury172 was inapplicable to ethyl mercury. -164-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 164 of 177diet. Dr. Brent also quashed Dr. Lucier 's claim that the cardiac system was the most sensitive173 aspec t of physiology to merc ury toxicity, as cardiac problems were not even considere d as a measura ble endpoint for study ing mercur y toxicity. Indeed, the Court's question when reviewing Dr. Lucier 's testimony about the relative sensitivity of the cardiac system vis-\u00e0-v is the centr al nervous system was why cardiac symptoms were never observe d or systematically measure d in any study of subjects who received a sub-tox ic dose. All of the studies relied upon by Petitioners to implicate t he cardiac system were in the contex t of mercury poisoning, hundreds if not thousands of times the dosag e of a thimerosal-c ontaining vaccine. Howeve r, neurolog ical effects were the ones studied in all of the Fa roe a nd Sey chelles I sland studies as the most sensitive point for study . Far worse than Dr. L ucier 's fora y into medical tox icolog y was the a ttempt of Dr. Shane to opine in that area. Dr. Shane demonstrated his lack of knowledg e in this area by his complete denial of a dose re lationship. Dr. Shane said a t one point that dose was irreleva nt to his analy sis, and all he neede d to know was that a certain chemica l had been administered, and that the patient had died. His analy sis on this point assumes a hyper-cataclysmic result for every possibili ty: Some dose s of ethyl merc ury can be toxic, there fore it was toxic for this patient. If that potentiality is highly unlikely , then it must be a ssumed that this patient was just really \"diffe rent\" and hy perse nsitive to that chemica l. If the manner of toxicity is that it can cause arrhythmias at high doses, then here i t not only cause d arrhythmias, but myocarditis, cong estive heart failure , and death from spontaneous cardiac arrest. Dr. Shane's testimony was counter -inductive, which is not to say deductive: He assumed a conclusion, and used all manner of Procrustea n rationale to arrive at that conclusion. Such an approa ch is not scientific, and it is not helpful or persua sive to the Court. The Court heard from Dr. Shane based upon his expertise and experience in patholog y, not for him to try his hand at medical toxicology . The Court is only slightly more for giving of Dr. Connor. At lea st Dr. Connor admitt ed on the stand that he had no basis for the broad toxicolog ic claims he had made in his expert repor t. At some points, he conce ded that he could not provide citation for his conclusions on the spot, and prom ised to supplement his opinion with them (as should have been prese nt as part of his expert repor t); he never kept his word on this point. The Court is left to presume that he had no basis in medical literature upon which to state his claims regarding toxicolog y. At one point, conce rning the Magos paper , Dr. Connor demonstrated that he mi sunderstood t he contents and concl usion of the article , and yet relied upon that faulty understanding when he actua lly cited two (unre lated) paper s. At least, to his credit, Dr. Connor acknow ledged the verity of the dose relationship as a foundation of medica l toxicolog y. On the topic of medical literature , it is quite telling that no medical literature direc tly supported Petitioners ' centr al contention. Many of the studies on merc ury toxicity in general, to which P etitioners' ex perts attempted to analog ize, involved dosag es that were three to five orders of magnitude distant from the infinitesimal amounts of ethy l mercur y administered in thimerosal- Interestingly enough, the testimony of Petitioners' own toxicologist, Dr. Lucier, acknowledged that \"co-173 exposure to other neurotoxicants\" was a source of uncertainty identified by the National Academy of Sciences' monograph, The Toxicological Effects of Methyl Mercury, and could explain the difference in outcomes between the Faroe and Seychelle Island studies. Tr. 1 at 64-66. -165-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 165 of 177containing vaccines. To make matters worse, Petitioners' experts seized upon terminal conditions174 observe d in merc ury poisoning cases in an attempt to find simil ar phenomena in the instant matter. Most of those finding s were generalized a nd nonspecific to tox icity, some of them a side -effect of the patholog ical proce ss. Those that were somewhat more specific indicia for merc ury toxicity (e.g., \"torpe do\"-sha ped Purkinje ce lls) were unidentified or a bsent from the f acts a t hand. And those in vivo studies that analy zed the potential effects of thimerosal in vaccines, using dosag es that approximated what might be in va ccine s, redounde d against Petiti oners' conclusion, most notably Pichichero. Dr. Brent also dispelled the notion of a group of the human population that is hyper- susceptible to merc ury toxicity, such that a infinitesimal dose of thimerosal would be suff icient to cause death. Petitioners raised a host of factors that could add a person into such a hypothetical grouping , such as age, sex, and genetic predisposition. Considering that it forms one of sever al linchpins for Petitioners' theory of causa tion, the record is rema rkably bare of any evidenc e in support of this notion. Dr. Connor, having claimed that such a susceptibility existed, when presse d to describe the basis for his claim, a dmitted that it wa s mere spe culation, and that he was una ware of any proof on this point. Also, even if medical lit erature had identified a genetic predisposition for enhanc ed sensitivity to merc ury toxicity, no genetic analy sis was done in this case to test Thomas Kolakowski for such a g ene e xpression. Petitioners and their e xperts mer ely assume that Thomas was a mong suc h a hy pothetical g rouping , and ask the Court to do the same. The Court de clines. The crux of this issue is the dose-r esponse curve, a \"bell\" curve that represents how a population will respond to a given dose of ethy l mercur y. Although the re is a normal distribution among the population, even some outliers, those outliers rema in within finite bounds. In that sense, there are no \"hyperse nsitive\" individuals who are just so \"diffe rent\" that a virtually non-tox ic dose will have toxic effects upon them. Dr. Brent explained that, with some chemica ls, there are individuals who are hyperse nsitive, and only require a very small portion (compa red to the general population) to express an adver se effect, but noted tha t this has never been observe d in the case of merc ury. The Court now turns to consider the cardiologic evidenc e. The implosion of Dr. Connor's testimony on the stand cause d the Court to view the substance of his opinion askew , and to downg rade the persua sive weig ht of his testimony . He claimed to rely on medi cal literature for sever al statements that trave rsed far beyond the area of cardiology, and when he was called to account for these source s, he either was at a loss conce rning them, or admitted he was actua lly relying on other article s for the conclusions stated, or was proven incorre ct in his understanding of such medical literature. He opined far and wide in compar ing the EKG patterns of terminally -ill patients suffe ring merc ury toxicity with agonal rhythm strips from Thomas Kolakowski's EKG readings, befor e admitting that both sets of data were irrele vant for deter mining how Thomas Kolakowski died. Dr. Connor also place d a great deal of weig ht on the clinical observa tion (found to be insignifica nt by the Court, supra ) of \"tremors\" as noted in Mrs. Kolakowski's affidavit, despite Respondent's Brief summarized that subjects of the Dahhan study possessed blood levels of 15,000174 micrograms, compared to 1,000 to 5,000 micrograms in the Cinca subjects; on the other hand, the mean peak mercury blood level reported by the Stajich and Pichichero studies was 2.2 micrograms following Hepatitis B vaccination. -166-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 166 of 177the fact that Dr. Connor is not a neurolog ist. In fact, for all the testimony Dr. Connor offered on the topics of toxicolog y and neurolog y, he offered no opinion as to a mecha nism of injury as to how the amount of merc ury in a thimerosal-c ontaining vaccine could cause death, at least the cardiologic aspec ts of that proce ss. Furthermo appea rance of at straws\" for , that the mecha nism c ould ha ve been or was, an immunologic response to merc ury, a curious, if not dubious, proposition. This idea was never raised in his expert repor t, but came about after a withering cross-e xamination that led Dr. Connor to distance himself largely from his previously stated opinion. Of course , Dr. Connor is not an immunologist, and Petitioners offered no immunologic expert witness evidenc e. The Court f inds it telling, none theless, that Petitioners' offered cardiologist was will ing to offer an opinion on causa tion from a standpoint of toxicolog y, neurolog y, and immunology , but can offer no opinion for a theore tical mechan ism as it relates to cardiology . Even in the offer of a mere descr iption of whether Thomas Kolakowski demonstrated myocarditis, either clinically or patholog ically , Dr. Connor was at a loss, and deferred entirely to the patholog ists. Amazingly , Dr. Connor's only explanation, when presse d to suggest a mecha nism of injury , was to retreat to the redoubt of the post hoc ergo propter hoc logic al fallac y, that, because the vaccinations were the only clinically relevant antec edent to Thomas' death (in Dr. Connor's eyes, at least), there fore the vaccines must have cause d Thomas' death. As repeated ad infinit um in Vaccine Prog ram c ases, this line of re asoning is fatally defe ctive. Indeed, the only things approa ching cardiologic evidenc e in this case were references to medical literature wher e adver se cardiac finding s were associate d with individuals who had received poisonous doses of mercury. Intere stingly enoug h, even those finding s were inconsistent. If merc ury had a tell-tale, specific effect on the heart as a sensitive organ-sy stem , one would expect to see a specific syndrome of symptoms. Instead, many of the victims of poisoning had no cardiac symptoms observe d at all. The ones that did show cardiac symptoms demo nstrated a gamut of differ ent, nonspecific cardiac symptoms that were in no way traced aetiolog ically to the level of mercu ry toxicity by the re searchers, and demonstra ted no spec ific clinica l or patholog ical cour se. In contra st, Dr. Ringe l was firm that Thomas Kolakowski showed no signs of interstitial myocarditis, from his standpoint of a pediatric cardiologist. Simi larly, Dr. Ringe l opined that there was no evidenc e of cong estive heart failure or pulseless electrical activity as Dr. Shane had insisted. Dr. Ringe l was adama nt that there was no medical literature or evidenc e in the record that would suggest, let alone support, a relationship betwee n the amount of ethyl merc ury in thimerosal- containing vaccines and cardiac dysfunction or death from c ardia c causes. He r eitera ted what Dr . Connor had said, that the agonal EKG rhythm strips taken follow ing the discovery of Thomas as unresponsive were irrele vant and \"of no value\" in assessing a cause of Thomas' death, and were useless in forg ing a compar ison with the Cinca study 's data. Finally , on the topic of patholog y, Petitioners' expert, Dr. Shane, undermined the weig ht of his own testimony repeatedly. Petitioners never officia lly proff ered Dr. Shane as an expert in a particula r discipline, and his testimon y ranged far and wide across sever al in which he has no specific expertise; the Court admitted his testimony as a general patholog ist with many years of experience . Howeve r, in playing the expert in such persua sive in the Court's weig hing of expert testimony on the whole. By contra st, both Dr. Gilbert-B arness and Dr. -167-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 167 of 177Rorke-A dams were careful to testify only within their areas of knowledg e, even when presse d to offer an opinion on another area by Petitioners' cross-e xamination. They were also careful to delineate those conclusions that were based on experience within the field of patholog y which were not yet fully understood or explained within the profession. Even within the general realm of patholog y, Respondent's expert pathologists rema ined reticent to offer an opinion out side of their niche subspecialty , such as Dr. Gilbert-B arness abstaining from neuropa , or abstaining from for ensic pa thology . Another fact that undermines Dr. Shane's ability to persua de the Court was his Procrustea n approa ch to desc ribing the cardiolog ic findi ngs. In his first expert repor t filed with the Court, Dr. Shane descr ibed everything besides the brain tissue as normal, or at least unrema rkable . In his second repor t, he withdrew his blanket appra isal, finding myocarditis and other finding s in the heart and other organs that he believed corroborate d a cardiac injury from merc ury toxicity. When questioned about this shift at the heari ng, Dr. Shane explained that the cardiac finding s and other late-notice d organ finding s were so subtle, they require d a closer, second look to perceive. And yet, when he and Respondent's experts were battling over the interpre tation of the enlar ged photomicrog raphs on rebuttal and surre buttal, Dr. argued evidenc e of interstitial edema was \"more than slight; it's at least modera te, and one might even consider it sever e.\" Tr. 6 at 1616. As Procrustes to his houseg uests, Dr. Shane chopped and stretche d the evidenc e to fit his desig ns. Moreo ver, in the same rebuttal/surre buttal disputation, Dr. Shane focuse d on any (inflammatory ) white blood cell on the heart section slides as evidenc e of an inflammatory proce ss, even if it were rathe r isolated, we ll below the conc entra tion of an ac tual inflammatory reaction, averring that one cell is all he would ne ed to see to declar e an inf lammatory response . Also, Dr. Shane made so many claims that proved to be unsubstantiated, it made the Court much more cautious in relying on any of his testimony . In one hyperbo lic example, Dr. Shane prese nted, as part of his rebuttal testimony , a photomicrog raph which he descr ibed as liver cells from Thomas Kolakowski's patholog y slides, which he then used to advanc e his arguments on the existence of an ongoing patholog ical proce ss. Pet. Ex. 6 at 1600-01. He was rathe r insistent that the slide included a distinctive feature of the liver, \"the space of Disse.\" Id. Howeve r, when viewed Gilbert-Ba rness on surre buttal, she poi nted out that the cells in the pi cture were actually heart (muscle) cells, and not liver cells at all, a point conce ded by a chagrined Dr. Shane. Tr. 7 at 23-24; 66-67. Of course, for a patholog ist to confuse heart cells for liver cells gives an amateur ish impression, especially when Petitioners argue that the Court should follow Dr. Shane's interpre tation that there Dr. Gilbert-B arness' interpre tation that there was not. She did not see the \"mix ed inflammatory cell infiltrate\" or other signs of cardiac degeneration that he testified to perceiving . In fact, she witnessed no evidenc e of chronic , or even subacute proce sses, only the hypoxic ischemia, and some ce llular damag e that wa s the resulting artifa ct of slide pre paration. In any event, Dr. insistent interpre tation of myocarditis is ultimately irrele vant in the of a theore tical framework of a causa tion theory . As it is, Dr. Shane's argument about -168-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 168 of 177myocarditis is an exercise in the colloquially -terme d \"Texas sharpshooter fallac y.\" As Dr. Brent175 explained, myocarditis is not associate d with merc ury toxicity in any fashion, except that myocarditis can form part of the clinical profile of any very ill patient, such as those suffe ring from acute , sever e merc ury poisoning. Dr. Shane committed a simil ar logic al fallac y when he latched onto the finding s repor ted in the Cinca article , and attempted to portray Thomas Kolakowski's patholog ical finding s as simil ar. Although the authors of the study did not attribute certain finding s to the merc ury toxicity specific ally, but mere ly descr ibed the profile of symptoms that manifested, Dr. Shane did attribute certain symptoms and patholog ical findings in that study to the merc ury toxicity suffe red by its subjects, and then strained to find simil ar finding s in Thomas Kolakowski's records, in order to diagnose merc ury toxicity. This is the \"cum hoc ergo propter hoc\" or \"with this there fore because of this\" fallacy , which is another varia nt of the \"non causa pro causa \" fallac y. Once again,176 without a rubric within which to understand causa tion, this strained reasoning is unpersua sive, to the extent it is not downright irr eleva nt. One prime example of Dr. Shane's flawe d approa ch is when he graspe d to find similarities to findings in poisoning studi es, when they were inconsist ent wit h actua l findings a ssociated with merc ury toxicity. In one instance, he testified that Purkinje cell damag e was evident in Thomas Kolakowski's cerebellar slides, and related that to a finding in an article of medical literature . It was only when Dr . Rorke-A dams testified that it wa s revealed, with c itation to a reputable source , that the hallmark chang e of such cells in cases of merc ury toxicity was the \"torpe do\" shape transfor mation, w hich was not a ppare nt from Thomas' slides, and would be impossibl e to ide ntify if it had been prese nt, due to the necessity for a specia l kind of staining proce dure to observe them. Simi lar errors regarding the microg lia and oligode ndrog lia demonstrated that Dr. Shane was outmatched by the expertise and knowle dge of D r. Rorke- Adams in the realm of neuropa thology . At one point, Dr. Rorke-A dams explained that what Dr. Shane thought was granula r cell \"drop out\" was actua lly just a stage of development in the infant cerebellum. As per usual, the Court was impressed and heavily persua ded by the neuropa tholgic expertise of Dr. Rorke-A dams, and her ability to expl ain her conclusions cog ently . Dr. Shane was also observe d to stretch reality to fit his construct when considering the clinical finding s upon which he r elied in his patholog ical diagnosis. He viewe d a ra sh as possible evidenc e of hyperse nsitivi ty, when the medical records are specific that the \"rash\" was actua lly This category of fallacy receives its name from the concept of a gunslinger who fires a gun randomly at the175 side of a barn, and then draws a bullseye around the biggest cluster of bullet holes. It denotes a post hoc attempt to attribute association or causation between two or more unassociated events that happen by chance in conjunction with one another. It is a subspecies of the \"non causa pro causa\" family of fallacies. What follows is but one example:176 I talk about it being mercury toxicity. Again, in terms of the interstitial myocarditis, I don't know what the mechanism for that was. It is a finding. It's a finding that is reported in ethyl mercury toxicity deaths. I see it here. One and one equals two. Tr. 3 at 736. -169-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 169 of 177infantile acne in reaction to over- the-c ounter soap. He descr ibed ongoing gastrointestinal medical records prese nt an adequa tely-nourished, healthy -eating child, with the exception of the night befor e his de ath. Risibl y, Dr. Shane viewed as evidenc e of myocarditis Thomas' one- day history of gas. Of course , he relied on the tremors as neurol ogically signific ant, even though Petitioners' expert pediatric neurolog ist had already dispelled that notion months befor e the hearing. Noticea bly absent were the very distinctive symptoms of merc ury toxicity one could expect to observe in Thomas were he to have suffe red merc ury toxicity. From the symptom of pinkish skin to the photophobia descr ibed by the experts in this matter , Thomas appea red by all lights to be a177 healthy infant, even until he went to sleep in the wee hours of 25 Januar y 1999. As \"the dog that didn't bark,\" the absenc e of any such tell-tale clinical evidenc e of merc ury toxicity milit ates against a finding of lethal mer cury toxicity. In contra st, Respondent's postulate of hypoxic ischemia, ostensibly related to some manner of partial (inadve rtent) smothering , was corroborate d by the evidenc e, and serve d as both a competing tive theory so-ca lled \"factor unrelated\" affirmative defense for Respondent. The most striking clinical signs of such a possibili ty were the condition of co-sleeping stipulated to by Petitioners and the anter ior (frontal) lividit y by which Thomas wa s descr ibed. Also corroborative in the c linical rec ords was the slight head cold or upper respira tory infec tion noted to have been affecting Thomas the day prior to his death. Corrobora tive evidenc e of hypoxic ischemia was much strong er in the patholog ic finding s. The consolidation of the lungs, the petec hial hemorrha ging, the oral and nasal bleeding , and the cerebral edema all were consistent with, if not diagnostic of, hypoxic ischemic injury leading to death. One point of contention regarding the patholog ic record was the conclusion of the medica l examiner, which conclude d that Thomas' death was unexplained infant death, likely a formulation of SIDS, althoug h it did not rule out a potential association with the Hepa titis B vaccination(s). Petitioners argue that this equivoca tion about the potential for vaccine causa tion is tantamount to a diagnosis for va ccine causa tion, and is there fore entitled to the purported shortcut around proving specific causation ostensibly provided by the Federal Circuit's Capizzano v. Sec'y of HHS opinion. 178 See supra at 135. The Dahhan study listed clinical symptoms of toxicity including \"sore mouth, metallic177 tastes, blue lines, vomiting, diarrhea, dysarthria, ataxia, hyperreflexion, hyporreflexion, [and] atrophy.\" Supra at 62. There the Federal Circuit stated:178 In our view, the chief special master erred in not considering the opinions of the treating physicians who concluded that the vaccine was the cause of [the] injury. The fact that these physicians' diagnoses may have relied in part on the temporal proximity of [the] injuries to the administration of the vaccine is not disqualifying... In other words, if close temporal proximity, combined with the finding that [the vaccine at issue] can cause [the injury alleged], then medical opinions to this effect are quite probative. 440 F. 3d 1317, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2006). -170-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 170 of 177Of course , the medical examiner's conclusion ascribes no such relationship, and his only conclusion is a quasi-Socra tic conclusion not to conc lude on a true diagnosis at all. This leave s no true179 diagnosis for the Court to afford the deference due to a treating diagnosis, unless one reads his notation of sudden death as a shorthand for SIDS, w hich, as Dr. Gilbert-B arness testified, can be a sloppy code- word for positional asphy xia in many case s. 180 Most damning for Petitioners' claim, because it affects a global require ment for their claim which rema ins foundational to recovery in an actua l causa tion paradigm, was the absenc e of evidenc e in support of a theory of causa tion. This is the conce pt of general causa tion, which answe rs the question \"can it?\"-i.e., can the agent implicated cause the injury alleg ed in a logic al or plausibly hypothetical construct of medical scienc e? This element is represented in the Federal Circuit's Althen opinion by the requirement of a \"a m edica l theory causa lly connec ting the vacc ination and the injury .\" 418 F. 3d at 1278. The dearth of evidenc e on this crucial point is enoug h to defeat Petitioners' claim for compensa tion. Also, because none of Petitioners' postulated an explanation of a theore tical mecha nism by which injury or death could occur due to the amount of ethyl merc ury within thimerosal-c ontaining va ccine s, there is no way to assess the medical recor ds or the seque nce a nd timing of events, to see if they correspond to such a theoretical construct. Without proff ering a theory of causa tion, it is impossibl e for the Court to assess the other aspec ts of the Althen formulation of causa tion, namely discerna ble chain of causa tion in the medica a medica lly-appr opriate time fr ame. To the extent that Petitioners argument is that ethyl merc ury in thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines is prese nt in ample enoug h amounts to cause acute merc ury toxicity, leading to death, not only are the evidenc e of clinical indicia absent, but the timing interval prese nted does not jibe with the latenc y of adverse effe cts of toxicity, a point that was made repeatedly. Dr. L ucier stated t hat merc ury poisoning \"is not manifested immediately after exposure,\" but \"can be delay ed for a considera ble period of time.\" Tr. 1 at 66, 68. Not only did this latency period underc ut his criticism of the Pichichero article (as pointed out by Dr. Brent), but it also undermines a postulate of acute merc ury toxicity in this case. The only exception to this latency point was Dr. Shane, who believed that, reg ardle ss of dose admini stered, a per son could die within a day of any exposure to mercur y, but this was quite unpersua sive and gave the impression of overr eachi ng beyond his area of profe ssional e xpertise. Even in the poisoning cases ostensibly relied upon by Petitioners' experts, merc ury toxicity followed a latency , followed by the onset of symptoms, and only then, if at all, by The problem for Petitioners in relying thereupon is that this verbiage does not relieve them of proving general (\"can it\") causation. In fact, the Circuit's wording indicates that the \"can it\" question must have already been answered in the affirmative through sufficient proof in order for the treaters' conclusions to weigh heavily on the \"did it\" question. As noted repeatedly supra, Petitioners have failed \u00ef\u00c7\u00e4\u00e1 \u00d3\u00f4\u00e9 \u00ef\u00db\u00e4\u00a5\u00ed \u00ef\u00c7\u00e4\u00e1. that I know nothing.\" Plato, The Apology.179 Respondent also argues that a medical examiner cannot be considered a \"treating physician\" because he does180 not treat disease processes contemporaneously, but only analyzes disease processes posthumously. This question is not necessary to answer to resolve the issue raised, and the Court thus leaves it unanswered. -171-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 171 of 177death. Thus, even an argument of compar ison and analog y to the poisoning cases must fail, because the timing in the instant case does not follow what the evidenc e propounds to be a \"medica lly appropr iate time fra me\" f or onset and injury . All of these points build on one another , to arrive at the fa ctual finding that the Court w as persua ded neither that thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines generally, nor that two Hepa titis B vaccines in particula r, could cause the death of an infant like Thomas Kolakowski, and the Court remains unpersua ded that Thomas Kolakowski's death was actua lly cause d by his two Hepa titis B vaccines. The Court finds that Thomas Kolakowski's death was unrela ted to his vaccinations, based on the evidenc e prese nted, and that his death would have occur red notwithstanding whether those vaccines had been administered, or not. Furthermore , the Court finds that, in the case of Thomas Kolakowski, his death was the result of hypoxic ischemia, which may have been cause d by external, physical asphy xiation, but which, in any event, wa s unrelate d to the vacc ine. III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW A Court's authority to grant relief , just as with the Court 's authority to hear a particula r subject matter, is grante d by the Legislature. With the exception of the Supreme Court of the United States, federal courts are, one and all, creature s of statute; there fore they each exercise limit ed181 subject m atter jurisdiction which is itself grante d by statute. There fore, they have been gr anted182 United States Constitution, Article III, Section 1; Kline v. Burke Constr. Co., 260 U.S. 226, 234 (1922). 181 The Supreme Court, in a landmark case on federal jurisdiction, held: Jurisdiction of the lower federal courts is further limited to those subjects encompassed within a statutory grant of jurisdiction. Again, this reflects the constitutional source of federal judicial power: Apart from this Court, that power only exists \"in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\" Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 701-702 (1982). This restriction is based upon the appropriate deference due to state governments and laws contemplated182 by our federal system: The power reserved to the states, under the Constitution, to provide for the determination of controversies in their courts, may be restricted only by the action of Congress in conformity to the judiciary sections of the Constitution. Due regard for the rightful independence of state governments, which should actuate federal courts, requires that they scrupulously confine their own jurisdiction to the precise limits which a federal statute has defined. Victory Carriers, Inc. v. Law, 404 U.S. 202 (1971), quoting Healy v. Ratta, 292 U.S. 263, 270 (1934) (internal marks omitted). -172-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 172 of 177the authority and power to hear cases (i.e., jurisdiction ) wher e specific subject matter is at issue. 183 184 Jurisdiction, simpl y stated, is proper authority and exerc ise of (judicia l) power . In the context of federal courts, within the federal experime nt of these United States, the focus rests upon subject matter jurisdiction. The previously independe nt, sovere ign Colonies were each grante d independe nce from King Geor ge III to become States, and at first only confe derated185 for mutual benef it under the Articles of Confeder ation. After some time, the people of these sever al States decide d it was best to divest certain aspec ts of sovere ignty (but only those aspec ts) from each of the States, and to reinvest that sovere ignty in the national governme nt (now commonly referred to as the \"federal\" governme nt). As has been repeatedly shown, only those aspec ts of authority and sovere ignty which were vested expli citly in the national governme nt, throug h the ratifica tion of the United States Constit ution, can be exercised by any part of the fede ral governme nt. United States Constit ution, Amendment X. There fore, in a narrowing cone of authority : the Constit ution only grants to the national (federal) governme nt the authority given it by the people of the sever al States; the national governme nt as a whole may only exercise the authority contained in the body of the Constit ution; Congr ess may only legislate national laws accor ding to the gra nts and li mitations of authority contained in Article I, including their legislation granting judicial authority to the federal courts; and federal courts may only exercise jurisdiction over the subject matter of the legislation passed by Congr ess. As a result, federal courts do indeed wield great power , but they wield that power within a circumscribe d area of authority, beyond which they shall not trespass. This is the basis for the distinction betwee n federal courts, which are of \"limited\" jurisdiction, and courts of the sever al State governme nts, which retain general jurisdiction over all subject matter not expli citly and exclusively assig ned to the national ( i.e. fe deral) courts. This br ings us back to the Vaccine Prog ram. Congr ess ostensibly possessed constitutional prerogative to create the Prog ram under the authority of the Taxing and Spending Clause of the Constit ution, f ound at Article I, Section 8, Clause 1. In creating the Prog ram, Congr ess vested the United S tates C ourt of Feder al Claims (orig inally the C laims Court), acting through the Office of Special Masters, with \" jurisdiction over proce eding s to deter mine if a petitioner under [Section 11 of the Act] is entitled to compensa tion under the Prog ram and the amount of such compensa tion.\" Section 12 (a) . There in Congre ss also vested the Court with the power to \" issue and enf orce such order s as the court deems necessary to assure the prompt payment of any compensa tion awarded.\" The authority and power to hear cases relating to a particular subject matter of substantive law is what is183 properly referred to as \"subject matter jurisdiction.\" See generally Da Silva v. Kinsho Intern. Corp., 229 F.3d 358, 361 (2d Cir. 2000) (noting with chagrin that \"Court decisions often obscure the issue by stating that the court is dismissing 'for lack of jurisdiction' when some threshold fact has not been established, without explicitly considering whether the dismissal should be for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or for failure to state a claim\"). See, e.g., United States Constitution, Article III, Section 2: \"The judicial Power shall extend to all184 Cases...arising under...the Laws of the United States...\"; Vaccine Act, Section 12(a) (\"The United States Court of Federal Claims and the United States Court of Federal Claims special masters shall, in accordance with this section, have jurisdiction over proceedings to determine if a petitioner under [section 11] is entitled to compensation under the Program and the amount of such compensation. The United States Court of Federal Claims may issue and enforce such orders as the court deems necessary to assure the prompt payment of any compensation awarded.\") Treaty of Paris, Article I (1783).185 -173-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 173 of 177Id. The subject matter jurisdiction of the Court then, by which authority the Court rules here, is then the authority to decide if petitioners are entitled to compensa tion on their claims of vaccine-re lated injury , and if so, the a ppropriate amount of that compe nsation. Moreove r, the Court certainly possesses persona l jurisdiction over the parties. Indubitably , a petiti oner' s election to file a petition in the P rogram subjects him or her to the Court's control. Likewise, the express language of Congr ess in the Vaccine Act subjects the available amounts in the Vaccine Com pensation Fund to the C ourt's power, and even g rants explicit power to the C ourt to enfor ce its orde rs of pa yment from the F und. Section 12 (a) . 186 As aforementioned, the Court is authorized to award compensa tion for claims wher e the medical records or medical opinion have demonstrated by preponde rant evidenc e that either a cognizable Table Injury occur red within the presc ribed period or that an injury was actua lly cause d by the vaccination in question. \u00a7 13(a) (1). If Petitioners had claimed that Thomas had suffe red a \"Table\" injury , to them would \u00a713(a) (1)(A) have assig ned the burden of proving such by a preponde rance of the evidenc e. In this case, howeve r, Petitioners do not claim a presumption of causa tion affor ded by the Vaccine I njury Table, and thus the P etition may preva il only if it can be demonstrated to a pre pondera nt standard of evidenc e that the vaccination i n question, more li kely than not, actua lly cause d the injury and death alleg ed. See \u00a7 11(c) (1)(C)(ii)(I ) & , 956 F. 2d 1144 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ; Strother v . Sec'y HHS, 21 Cl. , 950 F. 2d 731 (Fed. Cir. 1991). The Federal Circuit has indicated that, to preva il, every petitioner must: show a medical theory causa lly connec ting the vaccination and the injury . Causation in fact requires proof of a logic al sequenc e of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury . A reputa ble medical or scientific explanation must support this logica l sequenc e of c ause a nd eff ect. Grant , 956 F. 2d a t 1148 (citations omitted); see also Strother , 21 Cl. Ct . at 370. Furthermore , the Fe deral Circuit later summarized this analy sis into a three pa rt test: [Petitioner's] burden is to show by preponde rant evidenc e that the vaccination broug ht about [the] injury by providing : (1) a medical theory causa lly connec ting the vaccination and the injury ; (2) a logic al sequenc e of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury ; and (3) a showing of a proxi mate temporal relationship between va ccina tion and injury . Althen v. Se , 418 F. 3d 1274, 1278 ( Fed. Cir. 2005). As part of that analy sis, the Fede ral Circuit re cently explained: In so doing, Congress made the conscious choice to vest adjudicatory authority in the Court of Federal186 Claims, an \"Article I court\" whose judges lack life tenure. Ex parte Bakelite Corporation, 279 U.S. 438 (1929) (\"Legislative courts also may be created as special tribunals to examine and determine various matters, arising between the government and others, which from their nature do not require judicial determination and yet are susceptible of it.\"). -174-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 174 of 177[T]he proxi mate temporal relationship prong require s preponde rant proof that the onset of symptoms occur red within a timeframe for which, given the medical understanding of the disorder' s aetiol ogy, it is medically acceptable to infer causa tion-in-fac t. de Bazan v. Se 539 F. 3d 1347, 1352 ( Fed. Cir. 2008). Under this analy sis, while a petitioner is not require d to pr opose or pr ove def initively that a specific biologica l mecha nism can and did cause the injury , he must still proff er a plausible medical theory that causa lly connec ts the vaccine with the injury alleg ed. Knudsen v. Sec'y of HHS , 35 F. 3d 543, 549 ( 1994). As a matter of elucidation, the Under signe d takes note of the following two-par t test, which has been vindicated and viewed with approva l by the Federal Circuit, and which guides the Court's187 practical appr oach to a nalyzing evidenc e in light of the Althen elements: The Undersig ned has often bifurcate d the issue of actua l causa tion into the \"can it\" prong and the \"did i t\" prong: (1) whether there i s a scientifically plausible theory which ex plains that such i njury could foll ow di rectly from vaccin ation; and (2) whether that theory 's proce ss was at work in the instant case, based on the factual evidentiar y record extant. Weeks v. Sec 'y of HH S, No. 05-0295V, 2007 WL 1263957, 2007 U.S. Claims L EXIS 127, slip op. at 25, n. 15 (Fe d. Cl. S pec. Mstr. A pr. 13, 2007). Of importance in this case, it is part of Petitioners' burden in proving actual causa tion to rant evidenc e both that [the] vaccinations were a substantial factor in causing the illness, disabili ty, injury or condition a nd that the harm would not have occur red in the a bsence of the vaccination.\" Paffor d v.

Sec'y of HHS, 592 F.3d 1315, 1321 ( Fed. Cir. 2010) quoting Shyface 'y of HH S, 165 F.3d 1344, 1352-53 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ; see also I d. citing Walther v. Sec'y of HHS., 485 F.3d 1146, 1151 (Fed. Cir. 2007) causa tion analy sis in off-Table cases, the Restatement (Second) of Torts applies and 'the petitioner is treated as the equivalent of the tort plaintiff'). In the water shed case of Shyface v. Sec 'y of HH S, 165 F. 3d a t 1352, the Fe deral Circuit \"adopt[ed] t he Restatement [(2d) of Torts] rule for purposes of determining vaccine injury , that an action is the 'legal cause ' of harm if that action is a 'substantial factor' in bring ing about the harm, and that the harm would not have occur red but for the action,\" and that rule continues to guide the Court today in the instant matter. Cf.188 Hargrove v. Sec'y of HHS * (Fed. Cl. Mstr. Apr. 14, 2009). Here, Petitioners never offered \"a medical theory causa lly connec ting the vaccination and the injury ,\" in order to show how the ethyl mercury in thimer osal-conta ining vaccines could cause the death of an infant vaccinee. That alone is a fatal defect in an actua l causa tion case, because if general causa tion is not proved, it is logic ally impossibl e for specific causa tion to be proved. In this specific case, Petitioners also failed to prove \"a logica l sequenc e of c ause a nd effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury ,\" to show that the ethyl merc ury in two thimerosal- containing Hepa titis B vaccine s did cause the death of Thomas Kolakowski. As such, P etitioners have not proven that death would not have occur red but for the administration of the vaccines, and the inclusion of thimerosal within those vaccines in particula r. This also means that Petitioners have not proven that thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines are a proxi mate cause of death. In actua l causa tion cases such as this, these defec ts of proof are fatal, and thi s Court has no alterna tive but to dismiss this claim. Hence , the Court RULES that Petitioners are not entitled to compensation. The mandate of the Federal Circuit in Shyface to follow the RESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS on the application188 of actual causation did not indicate how this Court should approach the tectonic shift of the common law into the later Restatement(s). The short answer to this question is that the Federal Circuit incorporated the RESTATEMENT (2D) OF TORTS, and until the Circuit does otherwise to change that gloss, that is the mandatory precedent binding on this Court. By way of more detailed analysis, given the Circuit's reasoning in Shyface for incorporating the Restatement, i.e. that Congress contemplated the common law (in its then contemporaneous understanding) within the Vaccine Act draftsmanship, thus presuming the common law as a background legislative intent, it would appear that only the Second Restatement is binding on this Court in matters touching on actual causation, because that is the version in use at the time of the Act's drafting and passage. Likewise, when the Federal Circuit decided Shyface in 1999, the RESTATEMENT (3D) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY had already become available in published form, and yet the Circuit did not choose to incorporate or even reference that Restatement's provisions at all, notwithstanding the potential corollary to the Program's focus on causation in the absence of a fault element. Had it done so, a contrary argument could have been made that the Circuit's reading of congressional intent was a progressing correspondence to whatever Restatement provisions were most current. However, this would seem to correspond to the more dubious \"statutory purpose\" canon of interpretation. The Court's reading of Shyface leads to a result that the Third Restatement should be viewed at most as persuasive, but not mandatory authority, and is not to be followed where it conflicts with the Second Restatement. -176-Case 1:99-vv-00625-UNJ Document 181 Filed 11/23/10 Page 176 of 177IV.
