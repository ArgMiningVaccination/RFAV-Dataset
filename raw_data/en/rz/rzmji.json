Ashe1 Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, United Kingdom Edited by Gary Struhl, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, and approved June 8, 2012 (received for review February 16, 2012) In the Drosophila embryo, formation of a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) morphogen gradient requires transport of a hetero- dimer of the BMPs Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Screw (Scw) in a pro- tein shuttling complex. Although the core components of the shuttling complex \u2014Short Gastrulation (Sog) and Twisted Gastru- lation (Tsg) \u2014have been ed, key aspects of this shuttling system remain mechanistically unresolved. Recently, we discov- ered that the extracellular matrix protein collagen IV is important for BMP gradient formation. Here, we formulate a molecularmechanism of BMP shuttling that is catalyzed by collagen IV. We show that Dpp is the only BMP ligand in Drosophila that binds collagen IV. A collagen IV binding -decient Dpp mutant signals at longer range in vivo, indicating that collagen IV functions to immobilize free Dpp in the embryo. We also provide in vivo evi- dence that collagen IV functions as a scaffold to promote shuttling complex assembly in a multistep process. After binding of Dpp/Scw and Sog to collagen IV, protein interactions are remodeled,generating an intermediate complex in which Dpp/Scw-Sog is poised for release by Tsg through speci c disruption of a collagen IV-Sog interaction. Because all components are evolutionarily con- served, we propose that regulation of BMP shuttling and immobi-lization through extracellular matrix interactions is widely used, both during development and in tissue homeostasis, to achievea precise extracellular BMP distribution. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) form a conserved family of signaling proteins with important functions during development and disease. BMP activity is regulated by a large number of extracellular proteins that modulate BMP receptor binding, stability, or distribution (1, 2). The early Drosophila embryo serves as an excellent model system to study extracellularmechanisms of BMP regulation, because a gradient of BMPactivity speci es cell fates along the dorsoventral axis (3). Although the two BMP ligands , Dpp and Scw, are broadly expressed, a conserved set of extracellular regulators mediate theredistribution of the Dpp/Scw heterodimer to the dorsal midline, where peak signaling occurs (4). In dorsal regions, Dpp and Scw are bound by Sog and Tsg into an inhibitory shuttling complexthat is unable to bind to receptors but is capable of moving (5 -9). Dpp/Scw is released from the shuttling complex by the proteaseTolloid, which cleaves and inactivates Sog (10). If Tolloidcleavage of within complex in dorsolateral Sog Dpp/Scw and can occur, until Tolloid cleaves the complex in dorsalmost regions where the concentration of Sog is low, allowing Dpp/Scw to bind itsreceptors and activate high levels of signaling (5). We have shown that the extracellular matrix protein collagen IV is important for BMP gradient formation (11). In embryosmutant for the collagen IV genes viking orDcg1 , peak signaling is lost and Dpp accumulation at the dorsal midline is reduced. Invitro experiments revealed that the C-terminal NC1 domain ofcollagen IV can bind to both Dpp and Sog. Based on these andadditional ndings, we proposed that collagen IV enhances BMPgradient formation by facilitating the assembly of the Dpp/Scw- Sog-Tsg shuttling complex, thereby promoting the long-rangemovement of BMPs (11). Although this model is supported byrecent quantitative modeling of the BMP gradient in the Dro- sophila embryo (12), the molecular mechanism of shuttling complex assembly on collagen IV, and whether it occurs in vivoto regulate BMP distribution, is unknown. Here, we have mapped the collagen IV binding sites on both Dpp and Sog. Based on these and previous interaction studies,we formulate a multistep, molecular model for the assembly ofthe Dpp/Scw-Sog-Tsg shuttling complex on collagen IV, whichwe test in vivo by using a collagen IV binding de cient mutant of Dpp. These experiments also provide in vivo evidence that col-lagen IV restricts movement of free Dpp ligands. We proposethat collagen IV may regulate short- and long-range signaling ofBMPs in diverse contexts. Results Mapping the Collagen IV binding Site in Dpp. We previously showed that the NC1 domain of the Drosophila collagen IV proteins Viking and Dcg1 (named VkgC and Dcg1C, respectively) can directly interact with an HA-tagged form of Dpp (11). MatureD p pi ss e c r e t e df r o m Drosophila S 2c e l l si nt w of o r m sr e s u l t i n g from alternative proprotein cleavage at the S1 or S3 site (GST-PD) experiments with bacterially pu- ried GST-VkgC, we found that the larger S1 form binds better to collagen IV than the N-terminally truncated S3 form (Fig. 1AandB; compare ratio of S1 to S3 forms in bound vs. input FL fractions). This result suggeste d that the N-terminus of mature Dpp is important for binding to collagen IV. The S3 site anddownstream residues form a highly basic stretch (Fig. 1 A). Partial or complete deletion of this basic region in Dpp- aa n d Dpp-c, respectively, strongly reduced binding of Dpp to col- lagen IV (Fig. 1 B), demonstrating that the basic motif is im- portant for its binding to collagen IV. These data also suggestthat the observed binding of the S3 form to VkgC (Fig. 1 B,l a n e 2) is likely to be due to its dimerization with the S1 form. Collagen IV Binding Site Is Not Conserved in Other Drosophila BMPs. We recently determined the N-termini of the other two Dro- sophila BMP ligands, Scw and Glass bottom boat (Gbb) (14). Sequence alignment reveals that the Scw and Gbb ligand domainslack the basic stretch found in the S1 form of Dpp (Fig. 2A ). and A.S. and H.L.A. wrote the paper.

This article contains supporting information online www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1202781109 COURSE BOOK PAGE 1Consistent with the absence of a basic motif, Scw and Gbb show little or no binding to VkgC (Fig. 2 B). These results further validate the Dpp basic motif as a collagen IV binding site andshow that the only Drosophila BMP protein that can interact with the collagen IV NC1 domain is Dpp. In the early embryo, the Dpp/Scw heterodimer is proposed to be both the most potent signaling species and the best substrate for Sog/Tsg-mediated shuttling to the dorsal midline (9). As shown in Fig. 2C , the Dpp/Scw heterodimer displays similar, if not better, binding to VkgC as the Dpp homodimer, againshowing relatively more binding of the Dpp S1 form. Consistent with Scw being unable to bind the collagen IV NC1 domain, the collagen IV binding activity of the Dpp/Scw heterodimer is me-diated by the basic motif in Dpp, because the Dpp a/Scw het- erodimer is unable to interact with VkgC (Fig. 2C ). Mapping the Collagen IV Binding Site in Sog. We next mapped the collagen IV binding sites on Sog. Sog is a large glycoproteinconsisting of four cysteine rich (CR) domains separated by a long\"stem\" region between CR1 and CR2 (10) (Fig. 3A ). To identify the regions of Sog important for interaction with the collagen IVNC1 domain, we tested binding of a panel of deletion constructs(Fig. 3 AandB). Overall, these experiments suggest that (i ) the CR domains mediate binding to collagen IV in a partially re-dundant fashion (e.g., compare FL vs. 3 vs. 4), and ( ii) the stem region has an inhibitory effect on binding of Sog to collagen IV (compare FL vs. 5). We next tested the binding of each CR domain individually. As shown in Fig. 3C , CR1 and CR4 bound efciently to VkgC, whereas no binding was detected for CR2 and CR3. An alignment of the Sog CR domains revealed that both CR1 and CR4 contain basic motifs (named B1, B2, B3, andB4) not found in CR2 or CR3 (Fig. 3D ). For Sog CR1, mutation of B1 greatly reduced binding VkgC 3E ). For Sog CR4, B2, B3, or single double mutants caused a partial loss ofbinding to VkgC, and the B2/B3/B4 triple mutant further at-tenuated the interaction (Fig. 3F ), suggesting that all three basic motifs in CR4 function with partial redundancy in binding col-lagen IV. Mutation of either B1 or B2/B3/B4 in the context offull-length Sog also partially blocked binding to VkgC, and binding was very weak when basic motifs were mutated in both CR1 and CR4 (Fig. 3G ). Molecular Model for Shuttling Complex Assembly on Collagen IV. We previously presented evidence that collagen IV enhances BMPtransport dorsally and proposed that it acts as a scaffold to en- hance shuttling complex formation (11). The identi cation of the collagen IV binding sites on Sog and Dpp, combined with pre- existing data, allows us to formulate a molecular model for the assembly of the Dpp/Scw-Sog-Tsg shuttling complex on collagen IV. Our previous data showed that the Dpp/Scw heterodimerand Sog together can bind VkgC, but the addition of Tsg releases Dpp/Scw and Sog from collagen IV into the Dpp/Scw-Sog-Tsg shuttling complex (11). Here, we show that the Dpp/Scw heter-odimer has only one binding site for collagen IV and that Sog hastwo binding domains, CR1 and CR4. These ndings suggest a probable mechanism of release of Dpp/Scw and Sog fromcollagen IV into the shuttling complex. The Dpp/Scw hetero-dimer and Tsg together, but neither of them alone, can release Sog from VkgC (11), suggesting that each \u2014Dpp/Scw and Tsg \u2014 competes with one of the two collagen IV binding sites on Sog. In vertebrates, the Dpp ortholog BMP2 and Tsg both bind strongly to CR1 and (15, 16), whereas the high af nity, we propose that Dpp/Scw interferes with the Sog-CR4/VkgC in- teraction (via Scw binding to CR4), whereas Tsg competes for binding of collagen IV to Sog-CR1. Furthermore, because nei-ther Sog nor Tsg alone can release Dpp from VkgC (11), we suggest a multistep model for shuttling complex assembly by collagen IV, in which release of Dpp/Scw is coupled to itstransfer onto Sog.

This binding restricts Dpp and Sog diffusion, but it also promotes the transfer of Dpp/Scw onto Sog, throughinteractions of Dpp with Sog-CR3 and of Scw with Sog-CR4,which leads to disruption of both Dpp/collagen IV and Sog-CR4/collagen IV interactions (Fig. 4B, step 2). The resulting Dpp/ Scw-Sog complex is bound to collagen IV by the Sog -CR1 in- teraction only and, therefore, poised for release by Tsg, which outcompetes collagen IV for Sog-CR1 binding (Fig. 4B, step 3).Consistent with the formation of a Dpp/Scw-Sog \"poised \"in- termediate on collagen IV, we show that Dpp- a/Scw, which lacks the collagen IV binding site, can associate with GST-VkgCin the presence Sog (Fig. 4C ). We used the collagen IV binding site mutant of Dpp (Dpp- a) to test our model in the context of the early embryo. First, we made use of a system for monitoring Dpp- a movement and signaling, based on ectopic expression from a stripe thatruns perpendicular to the normal dppexpression domain (Fig. 4D-F) (17). Activity of the peak threshold BMP target gene Race was visualized, which is normally expressed in a narrow stripe along the dorsal midline ( presumptive amnioserosa) (Fig. 4 G). of wild-type Dppunder the even-skipped stripe 2(st2)-enhancer activates BMP signaling in cells within and outside the stripe, leading to ex-panded Race expression (Fig. 4 H), consistent with the ability of the Dpp/Scw heterodimer to move long-range in the earlyembryo. In st2-dpp -aembryos, Race expression is also broadened and extends more posteriorly than in st2-dpp em- bryos (Fig. 4I ), suggesting that Dpp- a can signal normally and may be more mobile than wild-type Dpp. Additionally, evi-dence is presented that the a mutation does not affect Dpp protein levels ( Fig. S1 ). We next used this expression system to test key aspects of our model of shuttling complex assembly by examining the behaviorof Dpp- ai nsog andtsgbackgrounds. In both mutants, Race expression is lost in the presumptive amnioserosa but expandedin the anterior head region (Fig. 4 JandM), reflecting the loss of peak signaling and uniform intermediate signaling, due to theloss of dorsal BMP shuttling (6). In our model, collagen IVrestricts movement of free Dpp (i.e., when not bound to Sog);thus, one prediction is that Dpp- a, unlike wild-type Dpp, can move and signal long range in a sog background (Fig. 4 KandL).

COURSE BOOK PAGE 3suggesting that it is capable of long-range movement. This property is in stark contrast to that of ectopically expressed wild- type Dpp, whose effect is restricted to the st2expression domain (7) (Fig. 4K ). A second feature of our model is that Tsg acts to release the Dpp/Scw-Sog complex from collagen IV by disruptingthe Sog-collagen IV interaction. Therefore, we predict Dpp- a would, in general, be unable to move and signal long range in atsgbackground, where most Dpp- a/Scw-Sog should remain trapped on collagen IV (Fig. 4O ). Indeed, in the absence of Tsg, the effect of Dpp- a is largely restricted to its expression stripe (Fig. 4O ). Finally, our model proposes that collagen IV enhances the association of Dpp/Scw and Sog, implying that formationof the Dpp/Scw-Sog complex should be less ef cient for Dpp- a. In the tsgmutant, where assembly of the Dpp/Scw-Sog complex immobilizes BMPs on collagen IV, we therefore predict that some Dpp- a/Scw can move out of its expression stripe, whereas all wild-type Dpp/Scw is trapped by collagen IV-Sog (Fig. 4 N andO). Indeed, compared with wild-type Dpp, which is entirely restricted to its expression domain in tsgembryos (Fig. 4N ), some Dpp- a can activate signaling in cells away from its source. This intermediate-range signaling is observed as Race induction in a limited number of cells posterior to the st2domain in the majority ( 70%) of embryos (Fig. 4 O). In summary, our in vivo data support three key predictions from our model of shuttlingcomplex assembly. Discussion There is ample experimental and theoretical support for the notion that BMP gradient formation in the early embryo involves the concentration of the most potent signaling species, the Dpp/Scw heterodimer, at the dorsal midline in a process involving Sog and Tsg (4). Here, we present in vivo evidence for a role of collagen IV in two key aspects of this shuttling model, which have remained mechanistically unresolved. First, collagen IV functions to immobilize free Dpp, explaining why Sog and Tsg are needed for Dpp movement. Second, collagen IV acts as a scaffold for assembly of the Dpp/Scw-Sog-Tsg shuttling com- plex. The advantage to BMP gradient formation of assembling the shuttling complex on collagen IV has been suggested by analysis of organism-scale mathematical models (12). Thesemodels reveal that the in vitro binding af nity between BMPs and Sog is too low to account for the rate of shuttling complexformation required in vivo. However, by acting as a scaffold, collagen IV would increase complex formation by locally con- centrating Dpp/Scw and Sog. Models with a 10 -20% reduction in diffusion rates for Dpp/Scw and Sog and an increased ap-parent af nity of Dpp/Scw for Sog, show the best t to in vivo data (12). Our molecular model of shuttling complex assembly occurs in three steps. The rst step involves independent binding of Dpp/ Scw and Sog to collagen IV. The ability of Dpp- a to signal long range in sog embryos, where wild-type Dpp is trapped in its expression stripe, provides in vivo evidence that the Dpp-colla-gen IV interaction restricts movement of free Dpp ligands. The result also demonstrates that Sog and Tsg promote long-range movement of Dpp because they release Dpp from collagen IV, and not simply because they prevent Dpp -receptor interactions (8, 18). Restriction of Dpp diffusion by collagen IV may stabilizethe gradient by preventing ventral movement of Dpp/Scw after release from Sog/Tsg and range signallingst2-dpp-a I L' O'+/+ KL no signalling N Ono signallingRace N' Fig. 4.

It will be interesting, ultimately, to directly visualize Dpp and Dpp- a directly in sogandtsgmutant embryos. Although current methods allow detection of highlevels of receptor-bound Dpp (8, 9), there are technical limi-tations associated with speci cally detecting the pools of Dpp that would be informative here, i.e., Dpp/Scw heterodimer within the shuttling complex or Dpp- a/Scw diffusing between cells. Our data show that Scw is unable to bind the NC1 domain of collagen IV. This lack of collagen IV-dependent immobilization can explain why Scw, unlike Dpp, is capable of long-range sig- naling in the absence of Sog (8). Step 2 of shuttling complex assembly involves remodeling of the protein interactions to generate a poised intermediate. Spe- cically, step 2 is driven by Scw-mediated disruption of the Sog CR4-collagen IV interaction, so that Dpp/Scw is transferred from collagen IV to the Sog CR3-CR4 domains. Scw displacement of the Sog CR4 domain from collagen IV provides molecular insight as to why Scw is needed for Dpp transport (9). In addition to the binding preference of Sog and Tsg for the Dpp/Scw heterodimer(9), only nity for the Sog CR4 domain. Therefore, Dpp/Scw can be released from collagen IV into the shuttling complex, whereas the Dpp homodimer remains trapped on collagen IV. In the nal step of our model, Tsg mobilizes the shuttling complex by disrupting the Sog CR1 -collagen IV interaction. It has been noted that tsgmutants display a more severe reduction in BMP signaling than sogandsog tsg double mutants (8) (also seeRace expression in Fig. 4 JandM). This observation has been attributed to a potential Sog-independent pro-BMP activity ofTsg at the level of receptor binding (8). A second contributingfactor is suggested by our model, where Sog and Tsg act at dis-tinct steps to allow formation of the shuttling complex. In tsg mutants, Dpp/Scw is loaded onto Sog by collagen IV, butremains locked in this inhibitory poised complex, so that the onlyBMPs capable of signaling are Dpp and Scw homodimers, which are less potent than the Dpp/Scw heterodimer (9). By contrast, in sogorsog tsg mutants, Dpp/Scw is not shuttled dorsally but is still capable of signaling locally, adding to signaling by Dpp and Scwhomodimers. The weaker level of Dpp/Scw signaling in tsg mutants also provides support for our proposed order of steps 2and 3 in the assembly process, because this order gives rise to theinhibitory intermediate of Dpp/Scw-Sog. Previously it was shownthat an N-terminal fragment of Sog, called Supersog, which contains the CR1 domain and a portion of the stem, can partially rescue the loss of peak Dpp/Scw signaling in tsg embryos (19). Our model suggests that this property of Supersog comes from the ability of its CR1 domain to compete with full-length Sog for binding to collagen IV, thereby releasing Sog-Dpp/Scw, similarto the role of Tsg in shuttling complex assembly. We note thatthe CR1 -collagen IV interaction appears weaker than that of CR4-collagen IV (Fig. 3G), which may facilitate release of Dpp/ Scw by Tsg or Supersog-like fragments. After Tsg-mediated re-lease from collagen IV, the mobile shuttling complex can diffuserandomly. Upon Tolloid cleavage of Sog, the liberated Dpp/Scw heterodimer rebinds collagen IV, which either promotes re- ceptor binding (11) or a further round of shuttling complex as-sembly, depending on the local concentration of Sog. In addition to collagen IV, the basic region in Dpp/BMP2/4 also binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which caneither restrict or enhance BMP long-range movement (20, 21).Indeed, we nd that an HSPG-binding mutant, Dpp- N, also binds only weakly to collagen IV ( Fig. S2 ), suggesting that the collagen IV- and HSPG-binding sites on Dpp overlap. It will beinteresting to test how HSPGs and collagen IV interact to reg-ulate BMP activity in tissues where they are coexpressed, such as the early vertebrate embryo (20). In the early Drosophila embryo, the absence of glycosaminoglycan chains (22), which largelymediate binding of HSPG to Dpp (23), make it possible to speci cally focus on the Dpp-collagen IV interaction. A shuttling-based mechanism of BMP transport is also used in a number of other developmental contexts, including the earlyvertebrate embryo (24), speci cation of the vertebral eld in mice (25), and establishment of the posterior cross-vein territory in the Drosophila wing disk (26, 27). Restriction of BMP movement may also be important in other contexts, including several where collagen IV was already shown to regulate a short- range Dpp signal, such as the ovarian stem cell niche and the tip of malpighian tubules (8, 28). The basic collagen IV bindingmotif is highly conserved among the Dpp/BMP2/4 subfamily(20) and is also found in some other BMPs, including BMP3, consistent with reports that BMP3 and BMP4 can bind collagen IV (11, 29). Overall, these ndings support the idea that the collagen IV -BMP interaction is a conserved aspect of extra- cellular BMP regulation and suggest that the function of colla- gen IV in both long-range BMP shuttling and local restriction of BMP movement will impact on a number of other contexts inboth flies and vertebrates. Materials and Methods DNA Constructs. Cu-inducible Scw and Gbb constructs (pMT-Scw-1xFLAG and pMT-Gbb-3xFLAG) (14), Dpp N-HA (21), and pGEX4T1-VkgC (11) have been described. The coding sequences of Dpp-HA (10) and Sog-Myc (19) were inserted into pMT-V5/His-A (Life Technologies) and then modi ed by PCR to introduce deletions or mutations (details available on request). To expressindividual Sog CR domains, regions encoding amino acids 95 -186 (CR1), 737 - 814 (CR2), 825 (CR4) were cloned into pMT-Bip-V5/ His-A (Life Technologies) in frame with the C-terminal V5-His tag. For transgenesis, the Dpp- a deletion was introduced into SK-Asc2-Dpp (17) by PCR and transferred as an AscI fragment into the 22FPE vector (30). Protein cation. Scw-FLAG, as described (14). Sog-CR4 was expressed in S2 cel ls, because secretion from S2R+cells was inefcient. For Dpp/Scw heterodimers, we cotransfected 3.5 go fp M T - Dpp-HA and 1.5 g of pMT-Scw-1xFLAG. Heterodimers were puri ed from 2 mL of medium by incubation with 50 L of anti-FLAG M2 matrix (Sigma) according to manufacturer 's instructions. GST and GST-VkgC were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and puri ed on GSH-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) (details of puri cation available on request). GST-Pulldown Experiments and Western Blotting. Equal amounts of GST-fusion proteins bound to GSH beads were of Dpp-HA, Sog-CR-domain-V5-His-transfected medium or 100 L of afnity-puri ed Scw-FLAG/Dpp-HA complexes in pulldown buffer (20 mM at Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) at 4 \u00b0C for 1 -2 h. Beads were washed three times in 1 mL of pulldown buffer + 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and eluted in Laemmli buffer. Samples were separated by reducing SDS/PAGE,followed by Western blotting or Coomassie blue staining. Antibodies usedwere 67c23w118,sogS6/FM7c from Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center), st2-dpp (17). st2-dpp -alines were generated at Bestgene by injecting 22FPE-dpp ai n t o y1w1118embryos.

Gehring, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland, October 20, 2009 (received for review February 24, 2009) Bicoid (Bcd) is the anterior determinant in Drosophila. Accordingly, loss of Bcd causes loss of head and thorax and their replacement with posterior structures. bcdmRNA is maternally deposited at the anterior pole and Bcd forms an anterior-to-posterior (AP) concentration gra-dient. The expression of a series of zygotic head genes is thought tobe differentially regulated by distinct threshold concentrations of theBcd gradient. Thereby Bcd functions as a morphogen, instructingelds of cells to take on specic fates. Here, we show that spatiallimits of anterior genes are also set in the absence of a Bcd gradientand depend on factors of the maternal terminal system. The receptortyrosine kinase Torso (Tor), a key component of this system, is activein the pole regions of the embryo. Its activity downregulates thematernally deposited repressor Capicua (Cic), leaving high Cic activityin the central regions and decreasingly lower Cic activities toward thepoles. We show that the positions of posterior boundaries of Bcdtarget genes are dependent not only on Bcd, but also on Tor-mediatedCic activity. The results indicate that Cic can mediate repression through distinct binding sites within a Bcd responsive enhancer andthat gene activation by Bcd is antagonized by Cic. The activating andrepressive effects of Bcd and Cic, respectively, are integrated by theBcd target gene enhancer. We conclude that the spatial domains ofhead gene expression are determined by Bcd in concert repressors. gradient Bcd is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor required for head development in Drosophila (1, 2). bcdmRNA is maternally deposited and localized to the anterior egg pole by its3/H11032-UTR (3, 4). From there both the mRNA and ultimately the protein form a concentration gradient along the anterior-posterior(AP) axis (5, 6). Interestingly, a change in bcddosage leads to shifts in target gene expression. Reduction by one bcdcopy leads to an anterior shift of target gene expression boundaries, whereas anadditional copy results in a posterior shift (7). Thus, it has beensuggested that Bcd functions as a morphogen (8, 9) and that targetgene expression depends directly on distinct concentrations of Bcdalong the AP axis (7). This concentration-dependent gene activa-tion is thought to be mediated by the affinity of binding sites for Bcdwithin target genes (10-12). Targets expressed close to the sourcewould contain low affinity binding sites, whereas targets far fromthe source would contain high affinity sites. Bcd also can activateenhancers via cooperative binding (13, 14). In addition to Bcd, the terminal system has been shown to affect gene expression in the head region of the embryo. Torso (Tor), areceptor tyrosine kinase, is activated only at the poles (15) fromwhere it signals through the MAP kinase pathway and regulatesterminal gene expression by relief of repression (15-18). capicua (cic) mRNA is maternally deposited in the embryo, resulting in ubiquitous Cic expression. It has been shown that Tor downregu-lates the DNA binding repressor Cic at the termini by phosphor-ylation via the activated MAP kinase Rolled (19, 20), resulting inlow Cic activity at the termini and high activity in the center of theembryo. Loss of Cic leads to the derepression of head and tail genes and the expansion of these regions at the cost of the trunk andabdomen (19). Also, it has been suggested that Tor activity resultsin the phosphorylation of Bcd (21) strengthening its morphogenicnature along the AP axis (22, 23). At the anterior pole Tor has beenproposed to have an opposite function, i.e., to downregulate Bcdactivity, and that this effect causes repression of hunchback and orthodenticle at the anterior tip (21, 24). Here we show that uniform expression of Bcd leads to ectopic head gene expression with mirror image polarity at the posteriorpole. This effect is dependent on Tor-regulated Cic activity, con-firming a major role of the terminal system in the spatial control ofBcd-dependent head gene expression. We found that Cic activity isnecessary to determine the spatial limits of head gene expression byrepression. These results suggest that this effect of the terminalsystem is mediated by binding sites located in Bcd responsiveenhancers. We conclude that anterior patterning is dependent onthe interpretation of activation by Bcd relative to repression by Cicby the enhancers. Results Uniform Expression of Bcd Causes the Mirror Image Duplications of Target Gene Expression. To assess the ability of Bcd to activate gene expression independent of its gradient, we used the UASp/Gal4 system (25, 26) to ectopically express bcdwithout its localizing 3/H11032-UTR in the female germline. In embryos that derive from such females, the endogenous Bcd gradient was superimposed withtransgene-derived Bcd, resulting in uniform Bcd levels in theposterior half of the embryo (SI Materials and Methods andFig. S1 A,B,D, and E). In such embryos, the Bcd target gene hunchback (hb) (27), which is normally detected in the anterior 50% of the embryo, is ubiquitously expressed ( Fig. S2 AandB). However, Bcd target genes that are normally confined to more anterior regions,such as cap-n-collar (cnc) (28), tailless (tll) (29), and giant (gt) (30) are expressed in distinct but ectopic domains (Fig. 1; see also Figs. S2C,D,G, and Hand S3 A-C). cnc, normally expressed only in the anterior region (28) (Fig. 1 AandB), was also expressed in the posterior of embryos, which contain uniform high levels of Bcd (Fig. 1 EandF). Similarly, the anterior tip domain of Gt expression (Fig. 1 AandC) was duplicated in the posterior (Fig. 1 EandG). Gt expression was also detected in a central, ventrolaterally re-pressed domain, which resembled the anterior portion of theanterior stripe in wild-type embryos.

These findings indicate that the anterior patterns of these three genes were mirrored along an axis, which runs vertically through the anterior tlldomain, in an area in which it overlaps with the anterior Gt stripe. We confirmedthat the ectopic expression domains observed for cncand Gt were indeed mirror image duplications by the use of lacZ reporter constructs. The cnc /H14061(/H110015)-lacZ construct recapitulates cncin (/H110026)-lacZ recapitulates thegttip expression (Fig. S2 I). presence of unlocalized Bcd both the cnc/H14061 (/H110015) and the gt/H14061 (/H110026) lacZ expression domains in the ( Fig. S2 FandJ) as was observed forcncand Gt the presence of unlocalized Bcd. Thus, uniformly expressed Bcd causes an expansion and mirroring of anteriorexpression domains at the posterior pole (Fig. 1 E). In fact, the Hox gene labial (lab) (32), normally expressed in a stripe anterior to the cephalic furrow (33) (Fig. S2 K), was duplicated in a mirror image fashion in the posterior of embryos ( Fig. S2 L), indicating that these cells have indeed taken on specific anterior identities. Additionaly,we observed that the expression domains of other potential Bcdtarget genes in the head region, such as those of knirps (kni) (34), orthodenticle (otd) (12), (ems) (36), and sloppy-paired (slp2) (37), are duplicated with mirror image polarity in the posterior region in the presence of uniform Bcd (Fig. S3). To exclude that the endogenous Bcd gradient caused the ob- served mirror image duplications, we examined the effects ofuniform Bcd in embryos lacking endogenous Bcd. In the absenceof endogenous Bcd no gradient is detectable in the presence ofectopic unlocalized Bcd, indicating that all nuclei in the embryoreceive a similar amount of Bcd ( Fig. S1 CandF). embryos from females homozygous for the bcd E1loss-of-function allele (2), the anterior domains of cncand Gt are lost and anterior tllexpression strongly resembles its posterior expression (28-30, 38) (Fig. 1 I-L). In such embryos, uniform Bcd caused mirror image expression ofhead genes indistinguishable from its effect in the presence of endogenous Bcd (compare E-H andM-P in Fig. 1). cncexpression was restored at both poles of the embryos (Fig. 1 MandN). Thus, endogenous Bcd gradient information cannot be responsible forresidual anterior gene expression and their mirror image expressionpatterns in the posterior. This result shows that although Bcd isnecessary to activate head genes such as cnc, differential activation of target genes and their spatial order is not dependent on Bcdgradient information. Similar effects have been observed in em-bryos that express low levels of Bcd uniformly along the entire axis(11, 22, 39). Terminal System Activity Is Required for the Mirror Image Duplica- tions of Head Gene Expression Domains. It has been shown that the maternal terminal system activates anterior target genes by relief of repression (16, 17, 19). One of the main effectors of Tor signalingis Cic, a ubiquitous repressor of anterior and posterior geneexpression that is downregulated at the embryonic termini byactivated Tor signaling (19). Consequently, Cic and/or other Tor-dependent repressors could antagonize Bcd-dependent gene acti-vation and thereby position posterior boundaries (PBs) of Bcdtarget genes in the head. As Tor signals at both termini, Cic couldalso repress Bcd-dependent target genes in embryos which havereceived uniform levels of Bcd, causing the observed mirror imageduplications of anterior expression domains in the posterior region. In embryos from females homozygous for the cic 1loss-of- function allele, the head and tail regions are expanded at the expense of the trunk (19). Consequently, cnc, Gt, and tllexpression is expanded toward the center (19) (Fig. 2 A-D), indicating that although their anterior domains were delimited, their PBs were notproperly positioned (see below). In cic 1embryos uniformly express- ing Bcd, cncexpression domains appeared at both termini and were connected via a ventrolateral stripe (Fig. 2 EandF).

BOOK PAGE 8was confined to dorsolateral regions, excluding cnc- or Gt- expressing cells (Fig. 2 EandH). These patterns were distinctly different from those observed upon ubiquitous Bcd expression in wild-type or bcdE1embryos (compare Fig. 2 E-H with Fig. 1 E-H andM-P), indicating that the removal of Cic activity resulted in the expansion of Bcd target gene expression toward the center. How-ever, as minimal anterior patterning was observed at both poles incic 1embryos expressing uniform Bcd (i.e., cncand Gt expression at both poles separated by tllexpression), positional information must be provided by additional factors. To test whether such additional factors are also under the control of the terminal system, we examined the effects of ubiquitous Bcdin embryos lacking Tor activity. Such embryos, derived from tor PM homozygous females, fail to develop head and tail structures (15).Because of ectopic Cic activity in the terminal regions of tor PM embryos (19), the more central expression domains are shiftedtoward the termini, i.e., cncand Gt expression are lost from the anterior tip and both anterior Gt stripe and tllare shifted to the anterior pole (28-30) (Fig. 2 I-L). Uniform Bcd expression in tor PM embryos caused no duplications (Fig. 2 M-P), but embryos were continuously patterned, i.e., Gt and tllwere expressed in overlap- ping, ventrally repressed domains throughout the embryo. How-ever, cnc, a marker of anteriormost gene expression, was onlyweakly restored in some embryos. Thus, in embryos lacking Toractivity, genes normally expressed at the anterior tip of the embryowere repressed despite the presence of Bcd. Thus the entire embryowas continuously patterned, but the anteriormost information (i.e.,cncexpression) was missing. Corresponding results were reported from embryos containing low uniform levels of Bcd in the absenceoftor(22). We next expressed Bcd in embryos devoid of both torandcicto observe possible Cic-independent effects of Tor. Overall, expres-sion of target genes in embryos devoid of both torandcic(Fig. 2 Q-T) was very similar to that in cic 1embryos (19) (Fig. 2 A-D). Upon uniform Bcd expression, cncwas expressed in a dorsolateral domain along the entire length of the embryo (Fig. 2 UandV), Gt was expressed in a horizontal stripe of cells (Fig. 2 UandW), and tllexpression was undetected (Fig. 2 UandX). Thus, the anterior pattern was not duplicated, but instead the entire embryo resem-bled the anterior tip region. In summary, uniformly expressed Bcdcan cause anterior gene expression throughout the entire embryoonly in the absence of two key components of the terminal system.These results indicate that (i ) terminal Tor signaling is necessary to establish mirror image duplications in the presence of Bcd in theposterior pole region and ( ii) Tor does not act in this process through Cic alone.

Cic Is Required for the Determination of Spatial Limits of Bcd Target Genes. To assess the Cic requirement for the positioning of PBs of potential Bcd target genes expressed in the embryonic head region, we measured their positions in wild-type and cic1mutant embryos. We found that the PBs of the gtanterior tip domain as well as the huckebein (hkb), kni,otd,ems, slp2, and cncanterior domains were strongly dependent on Cic activity (summarized in Fig. 3 A;f o r RNA expression see Fig. S4). Target genes with PBs posterior to 60% egg length (i.e., the anterior gtstripe S4 Q-T, anterior pole is 100%, posterior 0%) were not notably affected bythe loss of cic. These findings suggest that Cic limits Bcd target gene expression strongest, or exclusively, in the presumptive head region.Interestingly, the expression pattern of gtappears to contain both acicsensitive (gt anterior tip) and insensitive domain ( gtanterior stripe). Although anterior gtstripe expression is not affected in cic 1 embryos, it is clearly shifted to the anterior tip in embryos lackingtor(30) (see Fig. 2 Iand K). This observation indicates that Tor-dependent factors other than Cic participate in establishing thePBs of Bcd-responsive genes posterior to 60% egg length. Addi-tionally, our results suggest that repression by Cic antagonizes Bcdactivity in the anterior regions of the embryo where Bcd levels aremuch higher than necessary for target gene activation (39). Con-versely, the distinct PBs observed in cic 1mutants suggest that the Bcd gradient provides some information for the spatial activationof target genes which, however, is not accurate enough to properlypattern the head region of the embryo. It is also possible thatadditional Tor-dependent factors participate in repression of an-terior Bcd targets when Cic is absent. Repression by Cic Is Mediated Through the torRE. Our results show that Tor-dependent repressors such as Cic position the PBs of Bcdtargets in the presumptive head region. Does this happen onBcd-dependent enhancers themselves? It has been shown thathuman Cic binds to the sequence motif TGAATGAA (40), whichis remarkably similar to the Torso-response element (torRE;TCGTCAATGAA) that mediates repression in the tllenhancer (16). To identify enhancers that contain both Bcd binding sites andtorREs, we screened DNA fragments previously identified as Bcdtargets in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay with subsequentmicroarray analysis (41) for torREs ( Table S1). We identified fragments that bound Bcd and contained torREs in the vicinity ofknown Bcd targets such as tll,otd,ems, btd, and overlapping enhancer previously identified in a computational screenas containing both sites head, kni /H14061(/H110025) and slp2/H14061 (/H110023)] (31). Additionally, we identified fragments overlapping with the enhancer module for the anterior tip expres-sion of gt(gt/H14061(/H110026) (31) and in the vicinity of a number of genes of known [e.g., homeobrain (42), goosecoid (43) and Dichaete (44)] and unknown function (e.g., CG31670) with anterior expression do- mains (Table S1). These observations support our hypothesis thatBcd and Tor-dependent DNA-binding factors share common en-hancers and together regulate the spatial limitations of anteriorexpression domains. To test whether Cic can indeed repress Bcd-dependent target genes through torREs, we used a minimal Bcd-responsive enhancercontaining three Bcd sites (21) (''bcd3T''), and added one (''bcd3T-1torREu'') or two (''bcd3T /H140612torRE'') torREs upstream of a lacZ reporter gene (Fig. 3 B). If the posterior expansion of gene expres- sion is dependent on repression by Cic, the addition of torREsshould shift the PB of the reporter gene toward the anterior inwild-type embryos and this effect should be lost in cic 1embryos. As summarized in Fig. 3C (Fig. S5 for RNA expression), torRE- dependent shifts were indeed observed, and the extent of the shiftwas dependent on the number of torREs. Furthermore, the PBs ofalllacZ reporters were found at around 70% egg length in the absence of Cic, indicating that the repressive effect mediated by the torREs is dependent on Cic. Also, these results indicate that Cic Fig. 3. Cic establishes the proper posterior boundaries (PBs) of head genes and can act upon a Bcd-responsive enhancer through torREs. PBs of anterior Bcd- dependent gene expression and reporter genes under control of Bcd-dependentenhancers were analyzed in wild-type (wt) and cic 1embryos (PB position in % of egg length (EL); anterior tip is 100%, the posterior 0%). (A )I ncic1embryos, the PBs of gene expression domains anterior to 60% EL in wt embryos (i.e., gtanterior tip domain, cnc,hkb, kni,otd, ems, slp2, and btd) are shifted by around 3-8% toward the posterior, whereas no effect was observed on Bcd target genes whosePBs were located posterior to 60% EL (the gtanterior stripe and anterior hb expression; see Fig. S4 for RNA expression). Note that the strength of the Cic repression effect declines toward the center of the embryo. ( B) Schematic repre- sentations of minimal enhancers (for sequences see Materials and Methods ) and expected positions of PBs in a wt background. bcd3T: a minimal bcdresponsive enhancer containing three Bcd binding sites (orange boxes) was placed upstreamoflacZ(blue box). bcd3T/H14061 1torREu: one torRE (purple box) upstream of the bcd3T. bcd3T/H14061 2torRE: torREs on either side of the bcd3T. The most central PB is expected for bcd3T, whereas bcd3t/H14061 2torRE should show the most anterior PB (PBs indicated by arrowheads in schematic). The position of the bcd3T /H140611torREu PB was expected to lie between the two. (C ) Addition of torREs shifts the PB of the bcd3T toward the anterior. The PB of the bcd3T is located most centrally of the three constructsat 68% EL, whereas that of bcd3T /H140611torREu is more anterior at 72% EL and that of bcd3T/H14061 2torRE is observed at the most anterior position, 77% EL. Unlike the torRE-containing enhancers, bcd3T is not dependent on cic. In the absence of cic the PBs of all enhancers were measured at around 70% EL (see Fig. S5 for representative stainings). Values are position in % stdv: standarddeviation. 21698 /H20841www.pnas.org/H20862cgi/H20862doi/H2086210.1073/H20862pnas.0910225106 Lo\u00a8h re ta l BOOK PAGE 10does not act directly on Bcd, as the PB of bcd3T- lacZ was inde- pendent of Cic. Hence, the spatial limits of Bcd target gene expression can be modified at the level of the enhancer withoutmanipulating the Bcd gradient or Bcd binding sites. Discussion A morphogen should be able to induce the expression of the same target gene in all cells in which it is expressed at the same level (9).When Bcd was uniformly expressed, we found that different Bcdtarget genes were expressed in spatially distinct domains withmirror image polarity. Thus, Bcd gradient information alone doesnot delimit the expression domains of target genes in the headregion. Removal of cicfrom such embryos caused the duplication of only the anteriormost target gene expression. This residualpatterning of the embryo could be the result of Tor functioningindependently of Cic. Removal of torfrom embryos uniformly expressing Bcd in the posterior caused the continuous patterning ofthe embryo. However, in the absence of Tor, Cic is also active at theanterior pole and thus able to repress for example cncandgt. Therefore, to obtain the expected response of target genes touniform levels of Bcd, both torandcicmust be removed from the embryo. It has been shown previously that toris required for the dupli- cation of otdat the posterior of embryos that express low levels of ubiquitous Bcd (22). This effect was attributed to the phosphory-lation of Bcd by the Tor pathway (21). However, nonphosphory-latable Bcd can rescue the bcd E1phenotype (23), showing that its phosphorylation is not essential for its function. In addition, weobserved that Cic activity affects the mirror image duplications inembryos that express uniform levels of Bcd. This result and theobservation that Tor mediates the relief of repression of anteriorgene expression (16-18) indicate that the posterior duplications arenot caused by a direct effect of Tor signaling on Bcd. The appear-ance of Tor-dependent upregulation of Bcd activity toward thecenter of the embryo (22, 23) and its downregulation at the anteriortip (21, 24) can be explained by the local downregulation ofrepressors, such as Cic. Consistently, both the cuticular phenotypeand the expression patterns of Bcd target genes in embryos lackingonly Cic activity are indistinguishable from those also lacking bothCic and Tor activity (19) (compare AandQin Fig. 2). Notably, cnc expression, which is lost in tor PMmutants (Fig. 2 I), is recovered in embryos devoid of both torandcic(Fig. 2Q ). Thus, the anteriormost Bcd target genes are not dependent on Tor-mediated phosphory-lation of Bcd. It is likely that Tor downregulates a set of partiallyredundant repressors at the termini, including Grainyhead, Tritho-rax-like (16), Tramtrack69 (45), and Female Sterile (1) Homeotic(46), gradually restricting their activities to the central region, whichresults in Tor-dependent relief of repression (16). The availableevidence supports the argument that mirror image duplications thatare caused by uniform expression of Bcd are the result of the spatialrestriction of repressors by Tor activity as exemplified here for Cic. It has been previously suggested that repressors regulated by the terminal system are necessary for the proper patterning of the headregion of the embryo (17, 39, 47). Our results provide evidence thatthe Tor-dependent repressor Cic can position PBs of genes that areactivated by Bcd. The effect of Cic is strongest on genes expressedat the very anterior and weakens toward the center. This observa-tion is not surprising, as genes whose PBs are found in regions withhigh Cic activity (such as hb) should be less susceptible to repression by Cic or regulated in a different manner. Recently, it has beenreported that Bcd levels in the anterior are much higher thanneeded for target gene activation (39). In fact, we observed that theexpression domains of genes, such as cnc, indeed expand toward posterior when Cic is absent. Thus, Bcd activates such genes in abroad domain, which becomes restricted by repression through Cicand possibly other Tor-dependent repressors. The ability of target genes to react to different thresholds of Bcd has been proposed to depend on the affinity of Bcd binding siteswithin the enhancer (10-12). However, a correlation between binding site affinity and posterior expression boundaries could not be observed in recent computational studies (48, 49). We and others(31) suggest that Bcd responsive enhancer modules such as those oftll,cnc, knirps, gt,otd,btd, and slp2contain torREs, originally identified in the tllenhancer (16). These sites are similar to the binding sites reported for human Cic (40). Our results demonstratethat the addition of torREs to the bcd3T enhancer caused aCic-dependent anterior shift of the boundary that corresponds toabout one parasegment per added binding site. Thus, such Cicresponsive repressor sites have the potential to be important for theprecise positioning of the PBs of Bcd activated genes by mediatingrepression in response to Tor activity. Our results suggest a model in which the input from the Bcd gradient alone is not sufficient to determine the spatial limits oftarget gene expression. Bcd is necessary and sufficient to activatehead genes, however, an antagonizing Cic activity gradient regu-lated by Tor determines their PBs. We propose a mechanism, whichintegrates information provided by activating Bcd and repressingCic activities via corresponding binding sites in the target geneenhancers (Fig. 4). At the anterior pole, where Bcd levels arehighest, Cic is downregulated by Tor, allowing the activation ofanterior genes by Bcd. Further along the AP axis, Tor activity fades(50) and thus, the antagonizing repressor activity of Cic increases.Cic and possibly other Tor-dependent factors can now repress genescontrolled by torRE-containing enhancers. Hence, the positions ofPBs of anterior genes are determined by activation by Bcd relativeto antagonizing repression by Cic on the target gene enhancers. The dependence of the precise determination of the spatial domains of Bcd target genes on specific Bcd threshold levels hasbeen called into question by this and recent other studies (39).Whereas Ochoa-Espinosa et al. (39) found that Bcd is present at Fig. 4. Model of anterior patterning with respect to Bcd and the terminal system. Interactions of the terminal system and Bcd on shared enhancers, exemplied with the bcd3T/H140612torRE, result in proper positioning of posteriorboundaries (PBs). The schematic in the background represents the approxi-mate distribution of Bcd (light orange), Cic (light purple), and Tor (gray) alongthe anterior half of the embryo. The expression domain of the bcd3T/H140612torREis observed from 100 to 77% egg length (EL; blue box). At 100% EL, Torstrongly inhibits activity of Cic and possibly other factors (broad red T-bar),leading to relief of repression of the enhancer. At the same time, Bcd has astrong activating effect on the enhancer (green arrow). At 77% EL theinhibitory effect of Tor is very weak (pink T-bar), so that Cic exerts a strongnegative effect on the enhancer (red T-bar), and lacZis no longer expressed at this position. However, we know that Bcd has an activating effect at thisposition, as it is able to activate the bcd3T construct to 68% EL. Thus, theenhancer is repressed at the position at which the repressive action of Cicoutweighs the activating effect of Bcd. We propose that both Bcd activatorfunction and Cic-dependent repression are integrated via the enhancer ele-ments of the target genes, resulting in distinct domains of gene expression.Orange boxes: Bcd binding sites; purple details on the enhancers see Fig. 3 legend.

Insummary, we conclude that Bcd is not a ''classical morphogen'' asinitially defined by Wolpert (8), but rather represents the activating component of a maternal ''morphogenic network'' that includes theterminal system. This network is required to set up both anterior-posterior polarity and to determine the spatial limits of geneexpression in the head region of Drosophila embryos. Materials and Methods The following mutant alleles were used: w1118, for P-element transformation and as strain; cic1.bcdcDNA was cloned into (UASp-bcd/H90043/H11032UTR)and expressed with V3-Gal4 (in gures and gure legends referred to as V3) (51) in the female germline. The bcd3T enhancer was cloned with or withouttorREs into pCaSpeR-hs43-lacZ containing attB sites. attB vectors were injected into embryos from females carrying the /H9278C31-integrase on chromosome IV and an attP landing site on chromosome III at 86Fb (line ZH-attP-86Fb) (52). Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridizations were conducted using stan- dard methods. See SI Materials and Methods for additional information. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. We thank J. Casanova, E. Wimmer, U.

Prior work suggested that dynein pulls the nucleus to the anterior side along a polarized microtubule cytoskeleton, but this mechanism has not been tested. By imaging live oocytes, we find that the nucleus migrates with a posterior indentation that correlates with its direction of movement. Furthermore, both nuclear movement and the indentation depend on microtubule polymerization from centrosomes behind the nucleus. Thus, the nucleus is not pulled to the anterior but is pushed by theforce exerted by growing microtubules. Nuclear migration and DV axis formation therefore depend on centrosome positioning early in oogene sis and are independent of anterior-posterior axis formation. The correct positioning of the nucleus isimportant for several developmental pro- cesses, such as cell migration, formation of the neuromuscular junction, and asymmetriccell divisions, whereas nuclear mislocalization is a feature of neurological disorders, such as lis- sencephaly ( 1). Positioning of the nucleus plays an essential role in Drosophila axis formation,because the movement of the nucleus from the posterior of the oocyte to a point at its anterior circumference breaks radial symmetry to polarize the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis ( 2,3). At stage 7 of oogenesis, an unknown signal from the posteriorfollicle cells induces a major reorganization of the oocyte microtubule The from the anterior-lateral cortex, resulting in an anterior-posterior (AP) gradient of microtubules that defines the AP axis ( 4). It is believed that dynein subsequently uses this polarized micro- tubule cytoskeleton to pull the nucleus to the oocyte anterior, making polarization of the DV axis dependent on the prior polarization of the AP axis ( 5-9). The nucleus is pushed to the anterior by grow- ing microtubules.

The nucleus migrates at a speed of 4.0 T0.7mm/hour (n= 6) and takes 2 to 3 hours to move across the oocyte (Fig. 1). The trajectory of the nucleus is variable: Sometimes it moves around the cortex of the oocyte directly to an anterior corner, but it often migrates up the center of the oocyte and then turns to move along the anterior cortex (fig. S1 and movie S1), confirming the random nature of this symmetry-breaking event. We observed that all migrating nuclei have large posterior indentations, suggesting that they are being pushed rather than pulled toward the anterior (Fig. 1A and movie S2). This could reflect anintrinsic reorganization of the nuclear architecture or a deformation induced by an external force to the nucleus. In support of the latter view, the direction of the indentation correlates with the direction of migration, suggesting that the same force creates the indentation and moves the nu- cleus (Fig. 1, B and C). This indentation is not an artifact of long-term imaging in oil, because egg chambers dissected directly into strong fixative have identical indentations (fig. S2). This idea that the nucleus is pulled to the anterior by dynein has its basis in the finding that mutations in the dynein accessory factors, Lis1 andBic-D , as well as disruption of the dynactin complex result in mislocalized nuclei at stage 10 (5-9). This is not compatible with the pushing model of nuclear movement, because motor pro-teins can only pull their cargoes. We therefore reexamined the role of the dynein complex by imaging the nucleus in Lis1 mutant egg cham- bers. Lis1 mutant oocytes are much smaller than normal because dynein is required for transport from the nurse cells into the oocyte ( 6). Never- theless, the oocyte nucleus prominent posterior indentation (movie S3). Thus, dynein is presumably required for the an- choring of the nucleus once it has reached the anterior, rather than for its migration. Consistent with this, the nuclei are only rarely mispositioned inLis1 andBic-D mutant oocytes at stage 9 but are mislocalized much more frequently at laterstages (fig. S3). Both actin and microtubule polymerization can generate pushing forces that lead to cellularor organelle deformations ( 10). Two lines of evidence suggest that microtubules are respon-sible for the nuclear indentation: First, depo- lymerization of actin with latrunculin A or B does not affect nuclear positioning, whereas the microtubule-depolymerizing drug colcemid in- duces mislocalized nuclei ( 11). Secondly, several microtubule-associated proteins become en-riched on the posterior nuclear envelope during migration, including the dynein light interme- chain (Dlic), calmodulin (Cam), and body defect, Mud (fig. S4) ( 12-14). To test the role of microtubules in the for- mation of the indentation, we added colcemid toliving egg chambers the +TIP protein,EB1-GFP (end fluorescent pro- tein), which forms \"comet \"on the growing plus ends of microtubules ( 15). Colcemid takes 3.5 min to diffuse into the oocyte, as monitored by adecrease in the number of EB1 comets on grow-ing microtubule plus ends. As soon as micro- tubule growth starts to decrease, the indenta- tion diminishes in size (Fig. 1D and movie S4). A focus of EB1-GFP persists posterior to the nucleus for several minutes, and, as this dis- Fig. 2. Active centrosomes are localized behind the nuclear indentation.

Thus, the nuclear indentation depends on microtubule polymerization, and its size is proportional to the number of growing microtubules. The nuclear indentation depends on active posterior centrosomes. Using EB1-GFP to track the growing microtubule plus ends in time-lapsemovies of nuclear migration revealed several strong foci of EB1-GFP behind the indentation, with growing microtubules emanating from them in all directions (Fig. 2A and movie S5). This indi- cates that microtubules are nucleated from MTOCs behind the nucleus. These MTOCs resemble the centrosomes, which migrate from the nurse cells into the oocyte during early oogenesis in a dynein-dependent manner, and localize to the posteriorcortex as a result of the initial oocyte polarity (16-20). Indeed, the centriolar markers Sas4 and PACT, well as a marker for pericentriolar ma-terial (PCM), centrosomin (Cnn) (21), localize to the foci behind the nuclear indentation at the on- set of migration (Fig. 2B). The centrosomes be- have rather dynamically during migration and change reversibly from a dense cluster to a more dispersed distribution (Fig. 2B). Upon comple- tion of nuclear migration, the centrosomes are recruited to the anterior-dorsal cortex of the oo- cyte, presumably as a consequence of the activa- tion of the dynein-dependent anchoring mechanism that retains the nucleus in this position (fig. S5and movies S6 and S7). Active centrosomes are therefore positioned behind the nucleus before and during migration. To test the role of the centrosomes in creating the nuclear indentation, we inactivated them by laser ablation. Upon ablation of the entire cluster of centrosomes, the indentation disappears, and the nucleus becomes spherical within 1 min (Fig. 3A and movie S8). This nuclear relaxation may occur more rapidly, because centrosome ablation causes local bleaching of the nuclear envelope, making it impossible to monitor nuclear shape during the first minute. However, local laser ab- lation of the nuclear envelope at the site of the indentation has no effect, excluding the possibil- ity that the disappearance of the indentation is a consequence of bleaching of the nuclear mem- brane (Fig. 3B and movie S9). Furthermore, ab- lation of the anterior of the nucleus does not affect the indentation, arguing against any pulling force from the anterior (Fig. 3C and movie S10). As described above, centrosomes are sometimes scattered behind the nucleus, causing multiple indentations. Ablating one cluster of centro- somes abolishes only facing them. The nonablated centrosomes remain ac- tive and induce an indentation on the adjacent side of the nucleus (Fig. 3D and movie S11). Thus, the nucleus is not a rigid structure, and the growing microtubules from the centrosomes exert force on the nuclear envelope to induce its deformation. The centrosomes are dispensable for oogenesis (22). We therefore examined nuclear migration in DSas-4 mutant ovaries that lack centrosomes. Consistent with the previous study, all nuclei mi-grate to the anterior-dorsal corner ( n= 117) and calized in foci behind the and EB1-GFP active posterior MTOCs (fig. S6). Thus, acentrosomal MTOCs form in the absence of centrosomes and can provide the pushing force for nuclear migration. Nuclear migration is independent of AP axis formation. As a further test of the idea that the centrosomal microtubules push the nucleus tothe anterior, we examined par-1 hypomorphs, in which some centrosomes fail to migrate tothe posterior of the oocyte ( 19).

These ectopic centrosomes eventually fuse with the posterior centrosomes to move the nucleus to the anterior-dorsal corner (Fig. 4B and movie S13). This explains why the nucleus migrates normally in par-1 mutants even though the AP axis is not polarized ( 23). Con- sistent with this, the nucleus in wild-type oocytes can migrate to the anterior before the anterior- to-posterior microtubule gradient is established (Fig. 2A and fig. S7). Microtubule growth provides sufficient force to move the nucleus. Another documented ex- ample of nuclear positioning by microtubule push- ing comes from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where microtubule bundles push against the cellends to maintain the nucleus in the cell center (24). The oocyte nucleus moves a much greater distance, however, and appears to be pushed bythe force exerted by single growing microtubules. To test the feasibility of this mechanism, we used Stoke 'sl a w( F=6phrv) to estimate the drag force (F) exerted on the nucleus. Assuming a cyto- plasmic viscosity ( h)100 Pas (25 ,26)a n dt h e measured values of the nuclear radius ( r)5mm and the velocity of migration ( v)4mm/hour yields a drag force 10 pN. We expect the actual drag force to be lower, because nuclear migration is so slow (1 nm/s) that the cytoplasmic actin mesh will turn over ahead of the nucleus, decreas-ing the effective viscosity ( 27,28). The longest microtubules can reach ~10 mm between the pos- terior of the nucleus and the posterior oocyte cor- tex, resulting in a critical buckling force F c5p N (29). This value is probably an underestimate, be- cause microtubules embedded within an elastic cytoplasm in vivo have been reported to bear compressive loads 100 times higher than those in vitro ( 30). Each microtubule can therefore generate a pushing force of at least 5 pN. Thus,the force of only two microtubules pushing at any time should be sufficient to move the nucleus to the oocyte anterior. We measured the number of microtubules pushing the nucleus by using EB1-GFP. In onezplane, 15.3 T1.6 (SEM) microtubules hit the nuclear indentation per minute ( n= 10, 2 oo- cytes), and they continued growing and pre- sumably exerting force on the nucleus for 2.77 T 0.14 s (n = 149) (Fig. 5, A to C, and movie S14). Given the thickness of a confocal section (0.8 mm) and the radius of the indentation [4.3 T0.2mm (n= 10)], an average of 5.9 T0.7 were pushing the nucleus at any given time.Microtubule polymerization can therefore pro- vide sufficient pushing force to drive nuclear migration. Nuclear migration is triggered by release from a posterior anchor. The migration of the nucleus is triggered by an unknown signal fromthe posterior follicle cells, which could act either by activating the centrosomes or by releasing thenucleus from a posterior tether. To address this question, we examined when the indentation ap- pears during oogenesis. Active centrosomes are already localized behind the nucleus at stage 5 of oogenesis and induce a posterior indentation (fig. S8A). This suggests that the centrosomes contin- ually exert a pushing force on the nucleus, which is tethered to the posterior until it receives a signal for migration. The nucleus remains at the pos- terior in gurken (grk) mutants, later in oogenesis(Fig. 6A), suggesting that they fail to migrate because they are not released from the posteriortether (fig. S8B and movie S15). Indeed, micro- tubules growing from active centrosomes prob- ably always exert a pushing force on the nucleus that must be countered by an opposing pulling force or anchor to keep the nucleus in place. For example, a nuclear indent ation is still visible ad- jacent to the centrosomes after the nucleus isanchored at the anterior (fig. S5A). Our results lead to a revised model for how the oocyte nucleus moves to break radial sym- metry and polarize the Drosophila DV axis (Fig. 6B). This model explains the failure to recovermutants that specifically disrupt nuclear migra- tion, because the driving force is provided solely by microtubule polymerization. Furthermore, our results imply that migration is triggered by the release of the nucleus from a posterior anchor,Fig. 6. The nucleus is anchored to the posterior before migration. ( A) The nuclei often fail to migrate in grk 2B6/ grk2E12mutants but still have prominent posterior in- dentations (arrows), indicating that they are tethered at the posterior.

Thus, polarization of the DV axis is independent of the formation of the microtubule array that defines the AP axis, as previously proposed. References and Notes 1. I. Dupin, S.

Kouwenhoven1 Majorana fermions are particles identical to their own antiparticles. They have been theoretically predicted to exist in topological superconductors. Here, we report electrical measurements on indium antimonide nanowires contacted with one normal (gold) and one superconducting (niobium titanium nitride) electrode. Gate voltages vary electron density and define a tunnel barrier between normal and superconducting contacts. In the presence of magnetic fields on the order of 100 millitesla, we observe bound, midgap states at zero bias voltage. These bound states remain fixed to zero bias, even when magnetic fields and gate voltages are changed over considerable ranges. Our observations support the hypothesis of Majorana fermions in nanowires coupled to superconductors. All elementary particles have an anti-particle of opposite charge (for example, an electron and a positron); the meet- ing of a particle with its antiparticle results inthe annihilation of both. A special class of par- ticles, called Majorana fermions, are predicted to exist that are identical to their own anti- particle ( 1). They may appear naturally as ele-mentary particles or emerge as charge-neutraland zero-energy quasi-particles in a supercon- ductor ( 2,3). Particularly for the realization of qubits in quantum computing arepairs of localized Majoranas separated from each other by a superconducting region in a topolog- ical phase ( 4-11). On the basis of earlier later semiconductor- based proposals ( 6,7), Lutchyn et al.(8)a n d Oreg et al.(9) have outlined the necessary in- gredients for engineering a nanowire device that should accommodate pairs of Majoranas. The starting point is a one-dimensional (1D) nano- wire made of semiconducting material with strong spin-orbit interaction (Fig. 1A). In the presence of a magnetic field Balong the axisof the nanowire (i.e., a Zeeman field), a gap isopened at the crossing between the two spin- orbit bands. If the Fermi energy mis inside this gap, the degeneracy is twofold, whereas outsidethe gap it is fourfold. The next ingredient is to connect the semiconducting nanowire to an ordinary s-wave superconductor (Fig. 1A). The proximity of the superconductor induces pairing in the nanowire between electron states of oppo- site momentum and opposite spins and induces a gap, D. Combining this twofold degeneracy with an induced gap creates a topological super-conductor ( 4-11 ). The condition for Z>(D2+m2)1/2, with the Zeeman the Land\u00e9 gfactor, mB is the Bohr magneton). Near the ends of thewire, the electron density is reduced to zero, and subsequently, mwill drop below the subband energies such that m 2becomes large. At the points in space where EZ=(D2+m2)1/2, Majoranas arise as zero-energy (i.e., midgap) bound states\u2014 one at each end of the wire ( 4,8-11). Despite their zero charge and energy, Ma- joranas can be detected in electrical measure-ments. Tunneling spectroscopy from a normal conductor into the end of the wire should re- veal a state at zero energy ( 12-14). Here, we report the observation of such zero-energy peaksa n ds h o wt h a tt h e yr i g i d l ys t i c kt oz e r oe n e r g y while changing Band gate voltages over large ranges. Furthermore, we show that this zero-bias peak (ZBP) is absent if we take out any of the necessary ingredients of the Majorana proposals; that is, the rigid ZBP disappears for zero magnetic field, for a magnetic field par- allel to the spin-orbit field, or when we take out the superconductivity.1Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology, 2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.2Department of Applied Physics, Eindhoven University of Technology, 5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands. *These authors contributed equally to this work.

Ect2 is a RhoGEF that plays a well-estab-lished role in formation of the actomyosin contractilering at mitotic exit, through the local activation ofRhoA. We nd that Ect2 rst becomes active inprophase, when it is exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, activating RhoA to induce the forma- tion of a mechanically stiff and rounded metaphasecortex. Then, anaphase, binding to RacGAP1 atthe denes the stage-specic changes in actincortex organization critical for accurate cell division. INTRODUCTION Cell division requires sequential changes in cell architecture, which are coordinated by a small set of conserved mitotic kinases ( Ma and Poon, 2011 ). Although most recent attention has focused on the changes in microtubule organization that accompany spindle assembly and that drive chromosome segregation, mitotic progression is also accompanied by pro-found changes in cell shape. These begin at the onset of mitosis as cells detach from the substrate and round up ( Cramer and Mitchison, 1997 ;Harris, 1973 ); a process that is important for spindle assembly, positioning, and chromosome capture ( Car- reno et al., 2008 ;Kunda and Baum, 2009 ;Kunda et al., 2008 ). At mitotic exit, cells then elongate and divide in two, before re- spreading to take up their resting interphase shape once more. Mitotic rounding requires the loss of substrate adhesion ( Dao et al., 2009 ), together with changes in surface volume ratio and osmotic pressure ( Stewart et al., 2011 ). In addition, the actin cytoskeleton is completely remodeled to generate a rigid and rounded actomyosin cortex ( Kunda et al., 2008 ). Although including ERM proteins ( Carreno et al.,2008 ;Kunda et al., 2008 ), 2003 ), Colin, and WDR1 ( Fujibuchi et al., 2005 ), are known to play roles in this process, it is not known how changes in actin organization are coupled to mitotic entry and progression. Entry into mitosis in mammalian cells is controlled by activa- tion of the mitotic Cdk1/CyclinB complex, through a tightly regu-lated process that involves multiple feedback loops ( Lindqvist et al., 2009 ). Once active, Cdk1/CyclinB phosphorylates a large number of targets, triggering many of the early events of mitosisincluding centrosome separation, chromosome condensation,and nuclear envelope breakdown ( Gavet and Pines, 2010b ). Although some of the key substrates mediating the effects of Cdk1/CyclinB activity on chromatin, the nuclear lamina, and the mitotic spindle have been identied ( Blangy et al., 1995 ;Ki- mura et al., 1998 ;Peter et al., 1990 ), it is not known if changes in Cdk1/CyclinB activity also function to directly alter actin la-ment organization and dynamics. Here, we identify a known Cdk1 substrate ( Hara et al., 2006 ; Niiya et al., 2006 ), Ect2, as a regulator of mitotic rounding. Ect2 is a RhoGEF that was previously shown to be essential forcytokinesis ( Tatsumoto et al., 1999 ), where it activates assembly of the contractile lasetty et al., Yonemura, 2006 ;Yu\u00a8ce et al., 2005 ). We show that Ect2 also activates RhoA and its down- stream effectors, Rho kinase (ROK), and myosin II, at the onset of mitosis to induce the actomyosin remodeling that drives both mitotic rounding and cortical stiffening. This early functionof Ect2 is dependent on its export from the nucleus in prophase, but does not require RacGAP1 (also known as MgcRacGAP) or microtubules, which have been shown to drive the relocalizationof Ect2 to the cell equator prior to cytokinesis ( Burkard et al., 2009 ;Petronczki et al., 2007 ;Somers and Saint, 2003 ;Wolfe et al., 2009 ;Yu\u00a8ce et al., 2005 ). These data show that, through regulated changes in its localization, Ect2 is able to reshapethe mitotic cell to drive rounding upon entry into mitosis and cleavage furrow formation at mitotic exit. RESULTSRounding Is Initiated at the Start of Mitosis To better understand the coupling between cell shape changesand mitotic progression, we began by determining the timing of mitotic rounding relative to the other events of mitotic entry. HeLa cells expressing Histone H2B-mRFP and tubulin-GFP Developmental Cell 23, 371-383, August 14, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. 371 COURSE BOOK PAGE 19(Steigemann et al., 2009 ) were imaged every 2 min as they pro- gressed through the cell cycle. Cell length (Feret's diameter) was measured ( Figure 1 A) and used to compare the timing of mitotic rounding with that of centrosome separation, chromosomecondensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and spindleassembly ( Figure 1 C). Mitotic rounding lasted 13.6 \u00b1 1.8 min, during which time mean HeLa cell length ( Picone et al., 2010 ) was reduced from 53 \u00b1 3 mm to 23.5 \u00b1 1.3 mm. Rounding began in early prophase, before centrosome separation and visiblechromatin condensation, around 6 min before nuclear envelope breakdown ( Figure 1 C). This makes rounding one of the earliest events in mitosis, concordant with the rise in Cdk1 activity during prophase as measured using a FRET probe ( Gavet and Pines, 2010b ). Since Cdk1/CyclinB is thought to directly control many events of prophase ( Gavet and Pines, 2010a ), this Cdk1/Cyclin B also instigates mitotic round- ing. Indeed, Cdk1/Cyclin B has been shown to be sufcient to induce rounding upon injection into interphase cells ( Lamb et al., 1990 ). Thus, in our search for upstream regulators of cell rounding, we focused our attention on established Cdk1 substrates. Ect2 Controls the Dynamics of Mitotic Rounding To identify regulators of mitotic rounding, we carried out an RNAi screen. We used siRNA to silence 60 key actin regulators. Sincewe aimed to identify genes that couple mitotic progression tochanges in cell shape, this set specically screens et al., 2006 ;Blethrow et al., 2008 ;Dephoure et al., 2008 ;Ji et al., 2002 ). Two days after siRNA treatment, HeLa cells were xed, stained, and analyzed to identify gene-specic siRNAs thatinduced reproducible changes in mitotic cell shape and actin organization (for details of screen methodology and list of genesscreened, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Table S1 available online). This identied a number of siRNAs that affected mitotic cell shape. Unsurprisingly in light ofprevious work ( Fujibuchi et al., 2005 ), this included two inhibitors of actin lament formation, WDR1 and actin capping protein(Table S1 ). More signicantly for purposes, screen identied a single well-established Cdk1 substrate, Ect2. To conrm a role for Ect2 mitotic rounding we turned to time- lapse microscopy. Ect2 loss of function has previously beenshown cause cytokinesis failure, leading to the formation ofbinucleate cells ( Tatsumoto et al., 1999 ). Our analysis therefore focused on the rst cell division after Ect2 knockdown (around24 hr after RNAi treatment) to avoid delays in rounding causedby cells being large and multinucleate. This analysis revealed that Ect2 depleted cells initiate rounding on schedule relative to nuclear envelope breakdown, but round more slowly (mean cell length (m)C t (mins) EF con Ect2-5 Ect2-6 Ect2-9 A con Ect2-6 +mEct2-GFP010203040506070 20 30 siRNA Ect2 siRNA t (mins)cell length (m)D 010203040506070 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 01020304050607080rounding time (mins)Centrosome separation DNA condensation NEB MT nucleation at spindle Anaphase NEBB -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 ****** p = 0.8 Alters Dynamics of Mitotic Cell Rounding (A and B) Time-lapse phase contrast images of HeLa cells rounding up before mitosis with celllength (Feret's diameter) indicated by red lineshowing cells treated with (A) control siRNA and(B) Ect2 siRNA.

COURSE BOOK PAGE 20rounding time of 31.1 \u00b1 4.3 min, Figures 1 B and 1D). The vast majority then went on to fail cytokinesis ( Figure 1 E). Both pheno- types were replicated using three different nonoverlapping siRNAs ( Figure 1 E) and the knockdown at 24 hr was veried in each case by western blotting ( Figure 1 F). Furthermore, as a denitive proof that the phenotype reflects depletion of Ect2itself, we rescued the RNAi phenotype in HeLa cells using theconstitutive expression of mouse Ect2-GFP ( Hutchins et al., 2010 ), which lacks the siRNA binding sequence ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Finally, this function for Ect2 is not conned to HeLacells, as a similar phenotype was observed following Ect2 knock-down in RPE1 cells, a diploid nontransformed human cell line, as well as in Drosophila S2R+ cells depleted of the fly Ect2 homolog, pebble (Prokopenko et al., 1999 )(Figure S1 ). These data lead us to conclude that Ect2 plays a conserved role in mitotic rounding. Ect2 Is Required for Assembly of a Stiff Cortical Actin Cytoskeleton at Mitosis Since we used confocal time-lapse microscopy to determine whether this role for Ect2 in rounding reflects a role in mitotic actin remodeling. In control cells expressing LifeAct- GFP ( Riedl et al., 2008 ), actin laments were found to redistribute to form a visible cortex underlying the plasma membrane as cells rounded and increased in height upon entry into mitosis ( Fig- ure 2 xed E and 2F). actin laments ap- peared profoundly disorganized in Ect2 RNAi cells ( Figure 2 E). In addition, Ect2 RNAi cells were considerably flatter than meta- phase control cells ( Figures 2 C and 2D). This role for Ect2 in mitotic actin cortex assembly would be expected to lead to corresponding changes in mitotic cellmechanics ( Kunda et al., 2008 ). To test whether or not this is the case, we used an ''optical stretcher'' to measure the rigidityof control and Ect2 in mitosis. This phototonic toolconsists of two counter-propagating laser beams that are used to trap and exert a stretching force on suspended cells passing through a central microfluidic chamber ( Figure 2 G) (Guck et al., 2001 ). The deformation induced by the two beams can then be used to determine a cell's compliance, an inverse measure of its stiffness. Using this system, we rst established that, as previously reported ( Kunda et al., 2008 ), mitotic cells are less compliant than interphase cells and that this depends on an intact actin ( Figure signicantly more compliant than control cells in mitosis ( Figure 2 H). Taken together, these data show that Ect2 is essential for the assembly of the normal, rigid, acto-myosin-based mitotic cortex. It has previously been shown that a rigid and rounded actin cortex is essential for spindle assembly in Drosophila cells ( Car- reno et al., 2008 ;Kunda et al., 2008 ). In addition, myosin II has been shown to play an important role in centrosome separation(Rosenblatt et al., 2004 ).Therefore Ect2 depleted HeLa cells might be expected to exhibit spindle defects. We found thatwhile Ect2 RNAi cells were ultimately able to build a bipolarspindle, cells suffered delays in centrosome separation and spindle assembly ( Figure S2 ) similar to those previously observed when myosin activity is compromised ( Rosenblattet al., 2004 ). In addition, Ect2 RNAi cells exhibited defects in the alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate and intheir segregation at anaphase, where we frequently observed lagging chromosomes ( Figure S2 ). Furthermore, when we used RNAi mediated depletion of Mad2 to compromise the spindle checkpoint and to accelerate mitotic progression ( Jones et al., 2004 ), the majority of Ect2 depleted cells exhibited catastrophic defects in chromosome segregation ( Figure S2 ), while few defects were seen in Mad2 RNAi control cells. Thus, the Ect2dependent changes in mitotic actin cytoskeletal organization and cell shape are required to support the timely assembly ofa functional bipolar spindle. Ect2 Acts Upstream of RhoA and Myosin II to Drive Mitotic Rounding Ect2 is essential for cytokinesis. It is recruited to the spindlemidzone at anaphase through a physical interaction witha component of the centralspindlin complex, RacGAP1 ( Somers and Saint, 2003 ;Yu\u00a8ce et al., 2005 ), where it induces the local activation of RhoA and actomyosin ring formation ( Tatsumoto et al., 1999 ;Kamijo et al., 2006 ;Nishimura and Yonemura, 2006 ). We used small molecule inhibitors and siRNAs to deter- mine which, if any, of these factors function together withEct2 in mitotic rounding ( Figure 3 A). Neither treatment with an siRNA against RacGAP1 nor the removal of microtubules withnocodozole affected the rate of rounding. This was the caseeven though RacGAP1 silencing resulted in a highly penetrant failure in cytokinesis. In contrast, and as expected based on previous work, the inhibition of downstream targets of Ect2,Rho ( Maddox and Burridge, 2003 ), ROK ( Meyer et al., 2011 ), and myosin II ( Cramer and Mitchison, 1997 ) led to a profound delay in mitotic rounding, similar to that seen following Ect2RNAi ( Figure 3 B). To test whether Ect2 is directly responsible for RhoA activa- tion before the of anaphase, a wasused ( Pertz et al., 2006 ). While RhoA activity was seen at the cortex of control cells in prometaphase ( Figure 3 C) as previ- ously described ( Mali et al., 2010 ;Yoshizaki et al., 2003 ), Ect2 silencing resulted in a marked reduction in cortical RhoAactivity ( Figures 3 D and 3E). Since RhoA activates ROK to alter myosin II activity, in part through the phosphorylation of myosin light chain ( Amano et al., 1996 ), we then used an antibody raised against p-myosin II to determine whether Ect2 also influ- ences myosin II activation at the onset of mitosis. In interphase cells, p-myosin II was visible in stress bers, which were lost along with focal adhesions in early prophase in control andEct2 RNAi cells ( Figure S3 ). At the same time, p-myosin II was seen accumulating at the retracting margins of controlcells as they rounded up ( Figure 3 F), but was largely absent from Ect2 RNAi cells ( Figures 3 G and 3H). By contrast, when we examined ERM protein activation using the same approach(Kunda et al., 2008 ), we observed no differences in ERM phos- phorylation between control and Ect2 RNAi cells ( Figure S3 ). Taken together, these data reveal that Ect2 is required at the early stages of mitosis to activate RhoA and Myosin II to drivethe actomyosin contraction required for cell rounding. Signi-cantly, however, the upstream regulators of Ect2 activity are distinct from those that are required for contractile ring forma- tion at mitotic exit.Developmental Cell Ect2 Controls Cell Shape in Early Mitosis Developmental Cell 23, 371-383, August 14, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. 373 COURSE BOOK PAGE 21Ect2 Is Phosphorylated throughout Mitosis How is Ect2 able to control distinct processes at different timesin mitosis? Ect2 has previously been shown to be phosphory- lated at multiple sites during mitosis, including at several Cdk1 target sites ( Hara et al., 2006 ;Niiya et al., 2006 ;Su et al., 2011 ;Yu\u00a8ce et al., 2005 ). This phosphorylation is required for its GEF activity ( Tatsumoto et al., 1999 ), and has been proposed to regulate changes in Ect2 activity. This led us to examine the phosphorylation status Ect2 during mitotic progression. Phos- phorylated mitotic Ect2 migrates on molecular AB EG D Hoptical fibre optical 4 80 4 8 Figure 2.

Using this gel mobility shift assay, we analyzed the extent of Ect2 phosphorylation in a synchronized population of cells following their release from a double thymidine block ( Fig- ure 4 B). Phosphorylated Ect2 rst appeared as synchronizedcells entered mitosis 11 hr after block release, consistent withthis form of the protein having an active role in mitotic rounding. Importantly, Ect2 then remained phosphorylated until 14 hr post-release, by which time the majority of cells had exited mitosis (Figure 4 C).

Again, the phospho-shifted form of Ect2 visible in metaphase remained until almost all cells had completed anaphase ( Figure 4 E). These data show that Ect2 remains phosphorylated throughout mitosis. Ect2 Leaves the Nucleus in Early Mitosis To understand how Ect2 might drive distinct changes in cellshape at the onset and exit of mitosis, we looked at its subcel-lular distribution during mitotic progression. In xed cells stained with an Ect2 antibody, endogenous Ect2 was found to localize to the interphase nucleus and nucleolus ( Figure 5 A). At the onset of mitosis, Ect2 was then localized in the cytoplasm prior to nuclear envelope breakdown, where it remained until it was recruited to the spindle midzone at mitotic exit.

Ect2 could be seen accumulating in the cytoplasmin early prophase, /C246 min before nuclear enve- lope breakdown and coincident with the onsetof mitotic rounding ( Figure 5 D). In addition, we conrmed that the change in Ect2 localization at prophase was accompanied by the nuclear import of CyclinB1, which has previously been shown to correlate with anincrease in Cdk1 activity ( Gavet followed shortly after mitotic kinase substrate phosphorylation in the nucleus, which was detected a phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro anti- body ( Figure S4 ). Ect2 contains two Cdk1 consensus sequences in the vicinity of its nuclear localization sequence (NLS). To test whether Cdk1 might act through these sites to regulate Ect2 localization, we generated a phospho-mimetic construct (Ect2-T342D-S366D). This localized to the interphase nucleus ( Fig- ure S4 ), suggesting that phosphorylation at these sites may not be sufcient to induce Ect2 nuclear export. However, this doesnot rule out the possibility that Cdk1 phosphorylation at othersites could control nuclear release.Developmental Cell Ect2 Controls Cell Shape in Early Mitosis 376 Developmental Cell 23, 371-383, August 14, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. COURSE BOOK PAGE 24Mislocalization of Ect2 to the Cytoplasm Is Sufcient to Drive Premature Rounding Since the recruitment of Ect2 to the spindle midzone triggersactomyosin-dependent furrow formation al., 2006 ;Yu\u00a8ce et al., 2005 ), we postulated that its relocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasmin prophase could be a key factor in driving mitotic rounding. We utilized several human Ect2 constructs to test this idea ( Fig- ure 6 A). Mammalian Ect2 protein consists of an N-terminal BRCT repeat domain, which is the site of RacGAP1 binding,a regulatory S domain that harbors NLS sites, and a C-terminal catalytic GEF domain ( Miki et al., 1993 ;Saito et al., 2004 ;Saitoz +8m z = from the Nucleus in Early Mitosis (A) Confocal micrograph showing Ect2 localization at each stage of mitosis in xed cells stained with an antibody against Ect2 (upper panel) and tubulin and DAPI to show mitotic stage (lower panel).

The black line shows mean cell length to give an indication of the onset of mitotic rounding. Error bars denote SD. See also Movie S2 .

We conrmed rst that when overexpressed, full length human (Ect2-FL, ( Niiya et al., 2006 ) is conned to the nucleus and does not affect cell morphology ( Figure 6 B). By contrast, a truncated form of Ect2 (Ect2-C, ( Su et al., 2011 ), which contains the C-terminal catalytic domain but lacks regulatory regions and can act as a constitu- tively active form ( Saito et al., 2004 ), is localized to the cytoplasm and is able to induce profound changes in interphase cell shape (Figure 6 B). Approximately 50% of interphase cells expressing Ect2-C adopt a small, rounded morphology ( Figures 6 B and 6C;Figure S5 ). In this they resemble cells in mitosis, with the notable exception that they retain stress bers, which are nor- mally disassembled in prophase. Thus, the of a active form of Ect2 is sufcient to induce ectopicrounding. As seen for mitotic cells, the interphase roundinginduced by ectopic Ect2 is dependent on the activity of ROK and myosin II since it could be reversed by the addition of small molecular inhibitors Y-27632 or blebbistatin ( Figure S5 ). To test the role of nuclear export in the regulation of Ect2- dependent mitotic rounding, we introduced point mutationsin its two NLS sites (Ect2 dNLS), which have been shown toprevent Ect2 Saito et al., 2004 ). Like Ect2-C, Ect2-dNLS was found to localize to the cytoplasm and to induceectopic interphase rounding ( Figures 6 B and 6C). This demon- strates that simply mutating ve residues in the NLS sequencesis sufcient to induce gross changes in cell morphology. To test whether the timing of Ect2 export from the nucleus contributes to mitotic rounding we then arrested cells expressing low levelsof G2 using al., 2006 ) for 14 hr. The inhibitor was washed out to enable cells to synchronously progress into mitosis in the presence or absence of Ect2-dNLS ( Figures 6 D and 6E). As ex- pected, the presence of low levels of cytoplasmic Ect2-dNLS,just below the threshold required to cause interphase rounding,had a signicant effect on the kinetics of rounding. Ect2-dNLSexpressing cells already appeared quite spherical in prophase (Figure 6 E) and underwent accelerated rounding upon entry into mitosis ( Figure 6 F and 6G; Movie S3 ). Thus, the appearance of cytoplasmic Ect2 is rate-limiting for mitotic rounding.

COURSE BOOK PAGE 26GEF activity of Ect2, since a full-length Ect2 construct containing a V566 > D mutation that has shown to be essential for GEF activity ( van Impel et al., 2009 ) was unable to rescue either the failures in rounding or cytokinesis induced by Ect2 siRNA (Figure S5 ). These data suggest that Ect2 is active throughout mitosis, and that shifts in its localization regulate distinct changes in actomyosin organization and cell shape. These beginwith the exit of Ect2 from the nucleus in early prophase, which functions as a key trigger for actomyosin remodeling as cells round up as they enter mitosis. DISCUSSION In this study we identify Ect2 as a critical link between the cell cycle machinery, which triggers numerous events that accom- pany mitotic entry, and the actin-dependent shape changesthat occur in early mitosis. We show that Ect2 is able to induce changes to both cell shape and cortical mechanics in early mitosis through the activation of RhoA and remodeling of theactomyosin cytoskeleton. The timing of mitotic rounding iscrucially dependent on the export of Ect2 from the nucleus in prophase, because cells lacking Ect2 fail to undergo timely mitotic rounding, whereas the mislocalization of Ect2 to thecytoplasm is sufcient, at low levels, to increase the speed of mitotic rounding and, at high levels, to induce ectopic mitotic- like rounding in interphase cells. Together these data allow us to propose a model in which regulated changes in the localization of Ect2 drive stage-specicchanges in mitotic cell shape ( Figure 7 ). In prophase, Ect2 is exported from the nucleus and phosphorylated by Cdk1, which allow it to activate RhoA in the cytoplasm to induce the acto- myosin reorganization and cell shape changes required fortimely bipolar spindle assembly. It is likely that the resultingmechanically rigid metaphase cortex also plays an important role in buffering the spindle from the potentially disruptive influ- ence of external mechanical forces ( Kunda and Baum, 2009 ). At mitotic exit, it has been shown that Ect2 is recruited to the spindle midzone as the result of its binding to a core component of the centralspindlin complex, RacGAP1 ( Burkard et al., 2009 ;Petronczki et al., 2007 ;Wolfe et al., 2009 ). There it repositions RhoA activity to control the formation of a circumferentialactomyosin band across the center of the anaphase spindle(Chalamalasetty et al., 2006 ;Nishimura and Yonemura, 2006 ; Somers and Saint, 2003 ;Yu\u00a8ce et al., 2005 ), ensuring the precise segregation of contents between the two daughter cells. Thus,by driving stage-specic changes in the local activation ofRhoA and the contractile actomyosin machinery, Ect2 is able to remodel mitotic driving rounding in early furrow formation at anaphase. Later, Ect2 isreleased from the spindle midzone soon after the onset of cyto- kinesis, leaving RacGAP1 free to catalyze mid-body maturation and abscission ( Simon et al., 2008 ). The bulk of the protein is then degraded by the APC ( Liot et al., 2011 ), while the remainder is reimported into the newly formed nuclei, to restore interphasecell shape. In this way, Ect2 resembles other mitotic proteinsthat display distinct roles at different times in mitosis, dependent on stage-specic changes in their localization e.g., Plk1 is known to associate with centrosomes at prophase, kinetochores atmetaphase and the midzone centrosome separation, microtubule attachment cytokinesis respectively ( Petronczki et al., 2008 ). Ect2 has been shown to be phosphorylated on multiple sites by Cdk1 ( Hara et al., 2006 ;Niiya et al., 2006 ;Su et al., 2011 ; Yu\u00a8ce et al., 2005 ). It is likely that this phosphorylation is required for its function in mitotic rounding, since Ect2 actively remodels the mitotic cortex in early mitosis under of Cdk1 activity. Previously, one Ect2 Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation site, T342, was becomedephosphorylated in anaphase ( Yu\u00a8ce et al., 2005 ), leading to the speculation that Cdk1 phosphorylation could inhibit Ect2,functionally coupling the initiation of contractile ring formationto mitotic exit. Our data, however, argue that this is unlikely tobe the sole mechanism by which Ect2 is regulated, since we see little change in the global Ect2 phosphorylation level at anaphase and it remains in a hyper-phosphorylated statethrough until the end of cytokinesis ( Figure 4 ). In line with this, Ect2 phosphorylation has been shown to relieve an auto-inhibi-tory interaction between the C- and N-terminal domains of theA B C D E Nuclear Envelope BreakdownAnaphaseCell length Cdk1 activitycytoplasmic Ect2centralspindlin complex assemblyFigure 7.

At anaphase, Ect2 isrelocalized to the central spindle and removedfrom the poles, resulting in the redistribution ofactive RhoA and therefore the contractile acto-myosin machinery to drive furrowing in the centerof the cell.(E) Export of active, phosphorylated Ect2 into the cytoplasm at mitotic onset stimulates a decrease in cell length. At anaphase, Ect2 remains activebut its location is modulated by binding toRacGAP1 at the spindle midzone, resulting inelongation of the cell, furrowing, and cytokinesis.Developmental Cell Ect2 Controls Cell Shape in Early Mitosis Developmental Cell 23, 371-383, August 14, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. 379 COURSE BOOK PAGE 27protein ( Hara et al., 2006 ;Kim et al., 2005 ) and to be essential for its GEF activity ( Tatsumoto et al., 1999 ). These data suggest that Cdk1 phosphorylation contributes to the activation of Ect2 at anaphase. A recent study identied a role for the C terminus ofEct2 in its recruitment to the membrane at anaphase ( Su et al., 2011 ). This membrane localization was shown to be essential for cytokinesis. Interestingly it was also suggested that thischange in localization at anaphase may be triggered by a changein CDK-mediated phosphorylation at T815. It is clear from our analysis, however, that Ect2 is able to activate RhoA at the membrane in metaphase despite its having a largely diffusecytoplasmic localization. Thus, the dephosphorylation of Ect2 at this site at anaphase likely induces a change in the rates at which Ect2 shuttles between the membrane and cytoplasm,and may function to limit the range of Ect2 0s action to allow for polar relaxation ( Sedzinski et al., 2011 ). If Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of Ect2 plays a role in the regulation of its activity at both metaphase and anaphase, animportant unsolved question is how bulk Ect2 phosphorylation persists following the inactivation of Cdk1/CyclinB at mitotic exit. This may be the result of Plk1-dependent phosphorylationof Ect2 at the midzone ( Niiya et al., 2006 ) or the result of the dynamic regulation of Ect2 dephosphorylation by mitoticphosphatases ( Barr et al., 2011 ;Bouchoux and Uhlmann, 2011 ). In addition, there may be subtle changes in the set of Ect2 phosphorylation sites that accompany mitotic progressionwhich change the relative potency of Ect2 and/or its specicityto tune its RhoGEF activity to the generation of a rounded cortex during mitotic entry or an actomyosin ring at mitotic exit ( Su et al., 2011 ;Yu\u00a8ce et al., 2005 ). A comprehensive dissection of the function and dynamics of Ect2 phosphoryla-tion through mitosis however is likely to remain a challenge for some time as it is hampered by the sheer number of sites revealed in both biochemical studies ( Hara et al., 2006 ;Niiya et al., 2006 ;Yu\u00a8ce et al., 2005 ) and large-scale screens for mitotic phosphorylation ( Beausoleil 2006 ;Dephoure et al., 2008 ). Although Ect2 provides a critical link between mitotic entry and cell rounding, it is clear that other factors are important inthe control of mitotic cell shape. These include the loss ofsubstrate adhesion, which is dependent on Rap1 inhibition(Dao et al., 2009 ) together with changes in osmotic pressure (Stewart et al., 2011 ). This may explain why Ect2-depleted cells, although suffering from profound defects in actin organization,eventually assume a roughly rounded morphology ( Figure 1 ). Indeed, we observed no defects in the timing of focal adhesiondisassembly in Ect2 RNAi cells ( Figure S3 ), suggesting that loss of adhesion may allow cells to decrease in length despite defects in actin organization and myosin contractibility. It is therefore likely that Cdk1/CyclinB and other mitotic kinasesdirectly regulate focal adhesion removal and changes to ion channels in parallel, independently of Ect2, to ensure their coor- dination. Nevertheless, the involvement of Ect2 in sequentialevents during mitosis suggests that it is a central organizer ofthe cortex through mitotic progression. Signicant changes to the actomyosin cytoskeleton occur at rounding when actin la- ments are rearranged to form a stiff cortical shell ( Kunda et al., 2008 ) and then at cytokinesis when the symmetry is broken by furrowing and polar relaxation ( Eggert et al., 2006 ). Since ourdata suggest that both processes are controlled by the samemolecular ''toolbox,'' downstream of Ect2 and RhoA, one might speculate that they are mechanistically coupled. Thus, the repositioning of Ect2 at anaphase, may serve to loosen the rigidactomyosin cortex at the cell poles, coupling cleavage furrow formation to polar relaxation. In fact, this was long the favored model for cytokinesis, in which polar relaxation was through toprecede and to drive furrow formation ( Roberts, 1961 ). There are several similar parallels in evolution where actin remodeling events required for cytokinesis are initiated beforecell division. In the early Caenorhabditis elegans cortical actomyosin flows determine cell polarity before divi- sion, in a process that is dependent Ect2 and RhoA ( Motegi and Sugimoto, 2006 ;Schonegg and 2006 Likewise in ssion yeast, preparation for cytokinesis begins beforeanaphase with the formation of actin-nucleating nodes at the onset of mitosis, which later condense to form the contractilering ( Goyal et al., 2011 ;Pollard and Wu, 2010 ). Our data suggest that a similar mechanism could operate in mammalian cells, with the events that remodel the actin cortex in prepara- tion for cell division being initiated by Cdk1-dependent Ect2 activity at the onset of mitosis, rather than by Cdk1 inhibition at anaphase. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Time-Lapse Microscopy For stable cell lines et al., 2008 ;Hutchins al., 2010 ), and a tetracycline-inducible line expressing Cyclin-B1-Venus (Di Fiore and Pines,2010 ) were on glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek) coated with 10 mg/ml bronectin (Sigma). For cell length measurements, cells were imaged every2 min using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope with a 20 3objective (numerical aperture, NA 0.4), and images acquired using a Hamamatsu Orca AGcamera and Volocity software (Perkin Elmer). Cell length was dened as thefurthest distance between two points on the cell perimeter (Feret's Diameter)and measured using Fiji. For lming inhibitor treated cells, inhibitors weredissolved in DMEM + 10% FBS and added one hour prior to commencinglming, except for C3 transferase, which was added 6 hr before lming began.Inhibitors were used at the (Sigma). For time-lapse confocal imaging, an UltraView Vox (Perkin Elmer) spinning disc system was used with 60 3oil immersion objective (NA 1.4). Images were acquired every 30 s with z slices every 4 mm covering the height of the cell. Single z plane images are shown. Immunofluorescence For immunostaining, cells were plated on bronectin-coated glass coverslipsand xed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min, permeablized with 0.2% triton-X inPBS for 5 min, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min andtreated with primary and secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature.Primary antibodies were used at the following 647 were used at 1:500. and imaged on a Leica SPEconfocal microscope with a 63 3lens (NA 1.3).Developmental Cell Ect2 Controls Cell Shape in Early Mitosis 380 Developmental Cell 23, 371-383, August 14, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. COURSE BOOK PAGE 28Gel Mobility Shift Assay and Western Blotting Ect2 bandshift experiments were carried out as previously described ( Niiya et al., 2006 ;Tatsumoto et al., 1999 ). Unsynchronized cells or cells arrested in mitosis by 5 mM STLC (Sigma) treatment for 18 hr were harvested in Laemmli Buffer (Sigma). Roscovitine (Calbiochem) was used at a concentra-tion of 50 mM for 2 hr. For block and release experiments, cells were synchronized by treatment with 2 mM thymidine (Sigma) for 14 hr, releasedinto fresh medium for 8 hr, followed by a second 14 hr 2 mM thymidine treat-ment, and then released for 10 hr before harvesting every hour. For mitoticexit, synchronization cells were synchronized at metaphase using the following protocol: 24 hr treatment with 2 mM thymidine, followed by 6 hr release, 4 hr in 100ng/ml nocodozole, and nally 2 hr in 10 mM Mg132. Cells were then released into fresh media and lysed at 20 min intervals. Sampleswere loaded onto an 8% SDS-PAGE gel before transfer onto an Immobilon-P(Millipore) membrane by western blotting. Membranes were blocked in 5%BSA in TBST for 1 hr, incubated overnight at 4 /C14C with primary antibodies, and for several hours at room temperature with secondary antibodies. Anti-bodies were used at the following dilutions: Ect2 quantied using ImageQuant TL software (GEHealthcare). Optical Stretching Cells were plated at 90% confluency in 25 cm 2flasks for RNAi treatment. Three hours after RNAi treatment, cells were arrested in G2 by addition of 9 mM RO-3306 (Enzo Life Science) for 18 hr, before release from the drug for90 min and harvest by mitotic shake-off. Interphase cells and multinucleateEct2 RNAi cells that had already failed cell division were excluded from theanalysis by visual inspection of DNA and measurement of cell diameter insidethe optical stretcher. The microfluidic optical stretcher (OS) has previouslybeen described in detail (Lincoln et al., 2007 ). Two counter-propagating near-infrared laser beams (g = 1064 nm), emerging from single-mode optical bers, are combined in a microfluidic channel to trap (low power p = 0.1 W/ber) and deform (p = 1.0 W/ber) single suspended cell by optically inducedsurface stresses. Cells were introduced into the OS at a concentration of50310 4cells/ml and experiments were done at room temperature (22/C14C). The mechanical properties of cells were measured by a creep complianceexperiment. This test enables a direct comparison between the mechanicalproperties of cells (Lautenschla \u00a8ger et al., 2009 ;Wottawah et al., 2005 ). A cell is rst held at low power in the optical trap and then a constant stress isapplied to the cell for 4 s (p = 1W). The relative cell deformation, or strainD(t)=Dr(t)/r o(during and after application of the stress) is recorded with phase contrast videomicroscopy. The compliance of the cell, representing a truematerial property, is dened as J(t)=D(t)/(s oFG), which is the strain D(t) normalized by the peak stress applied, so, and a geometrical factor FG(Anan- thakrishnan et al., 2006 ;Guck et al., 2001 ), which accounts for different cell sizes or different refractive indices. The refractive indices of cells weredetermined using YFP-CFP FRET biosensor (Pertzet al., 2006 ) and 32 hr after transfection 5 mM STLC was added for 15 hr to synchronize cell in mitosis. Cells were then xed with 4% formaldehyde and imaged using a Leica SP5 scanning confocal system with a 63x oil objective (NA 1.4). FRET efciency was calculated using acceptor photobleaching asdescribed (Matthews et al., 2008 ). Briefly, CFP and YFP channels were excited using the 458 nm and 514 nm lasers respectively. Cells were imaged pre-bleach, then a region consisting of half the cell was bleached for 2 min usingthe 514 nm laser at maximum power. Postbleach images were then acquiredfor each channel and the total FRET efciency ratio for the bleached half ofthe cell for an equal-seized nonbleached region andsubtracted from the bleached region to give the nal ratio.Statistical AnalysisGraphs were produced and statistical analysis carried out in Microsoft Excel.Bar charts show mean values with error bars representing standard deviation.Box plots show median as line, upper and lower quartiles as box, and range aswhiskers. The p values were calculated using the student's t test (two sampleequal variance, two-tailed), *p < 0.01, **p < 0.001.

In Caenorhabdi- tis elegans and Drosophila , the vMSP anchor secreted in acell type-specic fashion. We show that vMSPssecreted by neurons act on Lar-like protein-tyrosinephosphatase and Roundabout growth cone guid-ance receptors expressed in striated muscle. Thissignaling pathway promotes Arp2/3-dependent on proposethat neurons secrete vMSPs to promote striatedmuscle energy production and metabolism, in part through the regulation of mitochondrial localization and function. INTRODUCTION Mitochondria are obligate endosymbionts that generate ATP for cellular energy through oxidative phosphorylation andplay central 2003; Suen et al., 2008 ). They are often distributed nonrandomly in differentiated cells like neurons andmuscle, presumably to provide energy to regions high in meta-bolic demand. In neurons, mitochondria are enriched at syn- apses ( Hollenbeck and Saxton, 2005 ), whereas in mammalian skeletal muscle, mitochondria are positioned in pairs near theI-bands ( Vendelin et al., 2005 ). Motor proteins that move along microtubules drive mitochondrial transport over long distances ( Hollenbeck and However, the actin short-range docking specic sites Boldogh and Pon, 2007; Pathak et al., 2010 ). In chicken sensory neuron cultures, Nerve Growth Factor-conjugated beads promote mitochondrial accumulation and docking by a mechanism dependent on F-actin ( Chada and Hollenbeck, 2004 ). These data raise the possibility that growth factors may affect mitochondrial localiza- tion in vivo. The VAPs (VAMP/synaptobrevin-associated proteins) highly conserved protein family with an N-terminal MSP(major sperm protein) domain, a coiled-coil motif, and trans- membrane-spanning region anchored in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. The /C24120 amino acid MSP domain is named after C. elegans MSPs, which function as secreted ligands that induce oocyte maturation and ovarian muscle contraction ( Han et al., 2010; Miller et al., 2001 ). MSPs also have an intracellular cytoskeletal function, but this function is independent of actinand myosin, depends upon MSP polymerization into laments, and conserved in VAPs ( Bottino et al., 2002; Han et al., 2010; Lev et al., 2008 ). VAPs have been implicated in diverse processes, including regulation of lipid transport, ER mor-phology, and membrane trafcking ( Lev et al., 2008 ). In addition, VAPs and MSPs have a conserved function as a secreted signaling molecule ( Tsuda et al., 2008 ). We have shown that VAP MSP domains (vMSPs) are cleaved from the trans-membrane domain and secreted into the extracellular environ-ment, where they bind to Eph receptors (EphRs) and otherunidentied receptors ( Miller et al., 2003; Tsuda et al., 2008 ). The secretion mechanism appears to be unconventional andcell type specic. A P56S mutation in the human VAPB MSP domain causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and atrophy (SMA), two neuropathies characterized byprogressive muscle motor neuron degeneration (Funke et al., 2010; Millecamps et al., VAP cytoplasmic inclusions ( Teuling et al., 348 Developmental Cell 22, 348-362, February 14, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. COURSE BOOK PAGE 322007; Tsuda et al., 2008 ), and impaired MSP domain secretion (Tsuda et al., 2008 ). VAPB levels are reduced in sporadic ALS patients, sod1 mutant mice, and ALS8 patient motor neurons derived from induced pluripotent stems cells, suggesting that VAPB plays a widespread role in pathogenesis ( Anagnostou et al., 2010; Mitne-Neto et al., 2011; Teuling et al., 2007 ). Here, we present evidence that MSP domains comprise a conserved ligand class that modulates mitochondrial and morphology and oocytes. and Lar-like receptors that modulate theactin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex. VAP loss causes aberrant Lar and Arp2/3 I-bands, influences the ssion/fusion balance,and decreases transmembrane potential. We propose that neurons secrete vMSPs to promote mitochondrial localization and function important for energy metabolism in muscles.RESULTS VAP Loss Causes Muscle Mitochondrial Defects in Drosophila and C. elegans We previously 2002 caused myobrillar defects in the indirect flight muscle (IFM)of adult flies ( Tsuda et al., 2008 ). This defect could be sup- pressed by Eph receptor knockout, suggesting that neurons secrete the dVAP MSP domain. The IFMs are massive and provide most of the energy needed for flight. To test whetherVAP loss affects muscle, we examined the IFM in wild-typeand dvap null mutant flies using transmission electron micros- copy (TEM). In wild-type adults, TEM shows that the mitochon-dria are arranged in columns between the myobrils ( Figure 1 A). In contrast, most mitochondria in dvap null mutant muscle are small and have abnormal cristae, whereas others are largerand have vacuole-like structures ( Figure 1 A; 84% Mitochondrial Morphology in Drosophila of adult IFM (dorsal ventral) in wild-type control and mutant flies.

The myobrils, on the other hand, appear similar to control myo-brils. Hence, dVAP loss causes severe mitochondrial mor- phology defects in adult fly muscles. Next, we examined adult C. elegans body wall muscle to test whether the role of VAPs ( vpr-1 in worms) is evolutionarily conserved. Mitochondria matrix-targeted GFP (mitoGFP) undercontrol of the myo-3 muscle promoter, well as by feeding worms the dyes MitoTracker CMXRos and Rhodamine largely unbranched tubules within the belly ( Figures 1 B and 1C). 84.7% of these tubules in mitoGFP transgenic worms form linear arrays that are regularly spaced, correlating with the spacing between I-bands ( Figures 1 C and 1D; Table S1 , line 1 available online). Indeed, the mitochondrial arrays overlap with the dense bodies, which occupy the middle of the I-band and appear as small bumps organized in the same orientation as the myolaments(Figure 1 D). Identical results are observed with MitoTracker CMXRos and Rhodamine 6g. Additional support for the mitochondria with I-bands comes from muscle TEMcross-sections ( Figure 2 A). In contrast to wild-type, mitochondria in vpr-1(tm1411) mutants are not arranged in parallel arrays and are rarely associ-ated with dense bodies ( Figures 1 D and 1E; Table S1 , lines 1 and 2). Three-dimensional microscopy indicates that mitochon- dria form thin and highly branched tubular networks within the muscle belly ( Figure 1 E). TEM cross-sections conrm that Figure 2. Transmission Electron Micro- graphs of Wild-Type and MutantC. elegans Muscle (A-D) Adult body wall muscle cross-sections are shown. Arrowheads point to mitochondria withI-band localization, whereas arrows point tomitochondria with abnormal localization. Lightblue color demarcates muscle boundary. Bar,0.5mm. mitochondrial tubules in vpr-1 mutant muscle are smaller in diameter than controls and mostly displaced from the myolaments ( Figure 2 B;Table S1 , lines 1 and 2, p < 0.001). The muscle belly is expanded, in part due to abnormal actin branching (see below) and mitochondriararely localize to I-bands. Muscle myola-ments, ER, and motor neuron positions invpr-1 mutants appear similar to the wild-type ( Figure 2 B; data not shown). Moreover, vpr-1 mutants do not ex- hibit abnormal muscle ER homeostasis (S.M.H. and M.A.M., unpublished data).We conclude that vpr-1 is required for formation of tubular and largely un-branched mitochondrial arrays posi-tioned along the I-bands. Collectively, these data indicate that VAP loss in Drosophila and C. elegans causes specic muscle Networks The mitochondrial in vpr-1 mutant muscle appear more fused than tubules in wild-type muscle ( Figure 1 E). RNAi of the outer membrane ssion mediator drp-1 and the inner membrane fusion mediator EAT-3/OPA1 can be used to shift the ssion/fusion balance in mitochondrial networks ( Kanazawa et al., 2008; Labrousse et al., 1999 ). Shifting the balance toward fusion in wild-type animals by drp-1 RNAi causes the formation of elon- gated and branched networks similar to those in vpr-1 mutants, except that the matrix often accumulates in large aggregates (Figure 3 A).drp-1 RNAi in vpr-1 mutants also causes accumula- tion of aggregates. Shifting the balance toward ssionin wild-type and vpr-1 mutant animals by eat-3/opa1 RNAi causes mitochondrial fragmentation ( Figure 3 A). These data suggest that muscle mitochondria in vpr-1 mutants have low ssion/fusion balance. We tested whether or not the mitochondrial tubules in vpr-1 mutants are physically connected to each other, consistent with their appearance in confocal axial scans. Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) can be used to assess connectivityamong muscle mitochondria. Our fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments (data not shown) and a previous study demonstrate that mitoGFP rapidly diffuses betweencontiguous compartments ( Labrousse et periments, mitochondrial tubule is repeatedly photobleachedDevelopmental Cell VAPB and Mitochondria 350 Developmental Cell 22, 348-362, February 14, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, interconnected mitochon-drial networks will exhibit rapid reduction in fluorescence outside of the bleached spot. To assess mitochondrial connectivity with FLIP, we used conditions that stabilize mitochondria and prevent Figure 3. vpr-1 Loss Influences Muscle Mitochondrial Connectivity and Function (A) Genetic relationships between vpr-1 and the mitochondrial ssion mediator drp-1 or the fusion mediator eat-3 .

FLIP in control muscles causes rapid fluorescence loss in the targeted area, but the vast majority of surrounding mitochondria retain their fluorescence, even after 48 cycles (Figures 3 B and 3C). In 5 of 11 experiments, a single neighboring tubule lost fluorescence. The average bleached area in the 11 experiments was 7.8 mm2, indicating that individual tubules have limited connectivity in wild-type muscle. In contrast to the wild-type, FLIP in vpr-1 mutant muscles resulted in rapid loss of fluorescence in the targeted area and numerous surrounding mitochondrial tubules within 20 s of photobleaching initiation (Figures 3 B and 3D). The average bleached area in nine experi- ments was 32.6 mm2(p < 0.001 compared to the control). We calculated that each vpr-1 mutant muscle contains between 20 and 25 contiguous subpopulations of mitochondria, whereaseach wild-type muscle contains more than 100 subpopulations (based on an average muscle area of 800 mm 2). Therefore, mito- chondrial networks in vpr-1 mutant muscle exhibit increased connectivity relative to networks in wild-type muscle. This in- crease in connectivity may be due to an increase in fusion, reduction in ssion, or both. Mitochondrial dynamics can be observed in live animals using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. Mitochondria in S1 ). Shape changes and ssion gradually reduce tubule length over time during imaging. In vpr-1 mutants, ex- hibit ) and occasionally form ring- shaped structures that join other tubules or collapse ( Figure S1 A; Movie S3 ). Tubules move at speeds between 0 and 2.0 mm/min, although only a fraction of tubules are mobile under our condi-tions. We noticed that ssion sites in wild-type muscle aredifferent than sites in vpr-1 mutant muscle. In the control, ssion primarily occurs within elongated tubules (29/29 ssion events from eight videos). However, elon- gated tubules in vpr-1 mutants (1/12 ssion events from eight videos) and instead occurs at connection sites between tubules (Movie S4 ). We conclude that mitochondria in vpr-1 mutants are more mobile and have different ssion sites relative to mitochon- dria in wild-type muscle. Taken together, the results support the model that VPR-1 influences the ssion/fusion balance. VAP Mutants Have The abnormal mitochondrial morphology in vpr-1 mutants raises the possibility that their function is impaired. To evaluate muscle mitochondrial function, we used MitoTracker CMXRos, which concentrates in the mitochondrial matrix depending on trans- membrane potential ( Pendergrass et al., 2004 ). MitoTracker accumulation in vpr-1 mutant muscle mitochondria is reduced compared to accumulation in controls ( Figure 3 E). We found that drp-1 RNAi could increase MitoTracker accumulation, suggesting that matrix aggregation caused by DRP-1 loss can partially restore mitochondrial transmembrane potential in this MitoTracker accu- can be fully suppressed (see below), indicatingthat vpr-1 mutants are not decient in dye uptake or muscle transport. Worms with reduced mitochondrial respiration should con- sume less oxygen and generate less ATP. Indeed, vpr-1 mutants consume less oxygen than controls, whether the data are normal-ized to protein content ( Figure 3 F) or worm number ( Figure 3 concentration in 1-day-old adult vpr-1 is signi- cantly reduced compared to adult controls ( Figure 3 H). We previ- ously showed that sperm-derived MSPs promote reactiveoxygen species (ROS) oocytes ( Yang et al., 2010 ). vpr-1 mutants are more resistant than the wild-type to paraquat, which generates intracellular ROS that cause a concentration-dependent toxicity depending on endogenous ROS levels(Figure 3 I). Hence, vpr-1 mutants have reduced ROS, which could be due to decreased production or increased breakdown. These independent metabolic assays support the hypothesis that vpr-1 mutants have altered mitochondrial function. Inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) activity causes defects such as sluggish motility, reduced swim-ming rate in liquid, prolonged defecation cycle, reduced broodsize, slow development, and larval arrest ( Tsang and Lemire, 2003; Wong et ). In particular, muscle-specic ETC inhibition affects motility, brood size, and possibly defecationand development rate ( Durieux et al., 2011 ). Thus, vpr-1 mutants should exhibit some of these defects if their mitochondria have reduced respiration, as indicated by the metabolic assays. Indeed, vpr-1 null mutants exhibit sluggish motility, reduced (99.7 9.4 for vpr-1(tm1411) \u00b1 7.2 s for vpr-1(tm1411) versus 55.0 \u00b1 7.1 s for wild-type; p < 0.01), sterility, and slow development (57.7 \u00b1 3.9 hr for vpr-1(tm1411) versus 42 hr for wild-type; p < 0.001). We conclude that vpr-1 mutants have defects consis- tent with abnormal mitochondrial function in muscle andpossibly other cell types. Secreted Neuronal vMSPs Modulate Muscle Mitochondrial Position and Morphology Our previous studies showed that VAP MSP domains aresecreted in a cell type-specic fashion ( Tsuda et al., 2008 ). However, VAPs can also have cell autonomous functions. Todetermine the site(s) where VAPs function, we rst examinedDrosophila . Expressing dVAP in muscle of dvap null mutant flies using the MHC-GAL4 driver causes 100% lethality and does not rescue dvap mutant defects. In contrast, expressing dVAP using neuronal drivers, including C164-GAL4 and Elav-GAL4 lethality Chai et 2008; Tsuda et al., 2008 ) and nearly 100% of muscle mitochondrial defects associated with dvap loss ( Figure 1 A; data not shown). These data indicate that dVAP functions in a cell nonautonomous fashion, consistent with a signaling role. Next, we examined the mechanism by which VPR-1 acts on muscle in C. elegans . Transgenic GFP reporters driven by upstream vpr-1 genomic sequence show broad expression in adults, including the ventral nerve cord and body wall muscle (Figure S2 ), similar to Drosophila dVAP. However, vpr-1 expres- sion in muscles using the myo-3 promoter or intestine using the ges-1 promoter does not affect muscle mitochondrial shape or distribution in the mutants ( Figure 1 E;Figure S1 C). In contrast, vpr-1 expression in neurons with the unc-119 pan-neuronal promoter rescues mitochondrial morphology, distribution, andI-band position ( Figures 1 E) in/C2430%-40% of muscles, while most remaining muscles exhibit improved phenotypes. The incomplete rescue may be due to transgene expression mosaicism, overexpression, or missing untranslated regulatoryDevelopmental Cell VAPB and Mitochondria 352 Developmental Cell 22, 348-362, February 14, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. COURSE BOOK PAGE 36sequences, as neuronal expression in flies rescues nearly 100% of mitochondrial defects and neuron-specic VPR-1 inhibition causes mitochondrial defects in nearly all muscle (data not shown and see below). We conclude that VAPs are required inneurons to control muscle mitochondrial position and shape. The above data are consistent with neurons secreting vMSP domains to regulate muscle mitochondria. To furthertest this model, we inhibited neuronal vMSP secretion in wild- type worms. The VAP P56Smutation as a dominant negative, sequestering wild-type neuronal aggregates ( Ratnaparkhi et al., preventing secretion of protein ( Tsuda al., 2008 ). Neuronal VPR-1P56Sover- expression causes muscle mitochondria to form thin, branched, and abnormally distributed networks within the muscle belly,similar to vpr-1 null mutants ( Figure VPR-1 P56Sinvpr-1 null mutants, muscle mitochondria were identical to those seen in nontransgenic vpr-1 mutant controls. These data conrm that VPR-1P56Sacts as a dominant negative and support the model that neurons secrete vMSPs toregulate muscle mitochondria. C. elegans the and the transmembrane domain (Gkogkas et al., 2011; docu- mented vMSP secretion in Drosophila wing disc cells by ex- pressing a dVAP fusion protein with distinct N-terminal andC-terminal tags ( Tsuda et al., 2008 ). Only N-terminal tag con- taining the MSP domain was secreted. We used a similar strategy to test whether C. elegans neurons secrete the VPR-1 MSP domain. mCherry was fused to the N-terminus of GFP to the C terminus and this mCherry::VPR-1::GFP fusionprotein was expressed in neurons using the unc-119 promoter (Figure 4 A). While partial colocalization of mCherry and GFP was observed in motor neuron cell bodies (and other neuronbodies), mCherry was observed within axons and in the extracel-lular environment ( Figures 4 B-4D). GFP does not colocalize most axonal mCherry, nor does it colocalize with extracellularmCherry, indicating that the VPR-1 fusion protein is cleaved.Secreted mCherry/MSP fragments were observed at the body wall and vulval muscles ( Figures 4 C and 4D). mCherry fluid, and secreted molecules within the bodycavity (data not shown) ( Fares and Greenwald, 2001 ). Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that neuronssecrete vMSPs. An MSP Receptor Screen Identies SAX-3 Robo and CLR-1 Lar ReceptorsAn important prediction based on above data is that secreted vMSPs regulate a muscle receptor pathway(s) that transduces signals to mitochondria. vMSPs bind to EphRs other uniden-tied receptors ( Miller et al., 2003; Tsuda et al., 2008 ). However, EphR loss in C. elegans orDrosophila does not influence muscle mitochondria or mitochondria-related notshown), suggesting that an unknown receptor(s) mediates We previously developed an MSP re- ceptor identication assay based on the ability MSP domains conjugated to fluorescein (MSP-FITC) to speci-cally bind to receptors expressed in oocytes ( Miller et al., 2003 ;Figures S3 A and S3B). In the worm gonad, sperm secrete MSPs to induce oocyte maturation ( Figure 5 A), which involves Figure 4.

COURSE BOOK PAGE 38metabolic changes ( Han et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2010 ). Under conditions where all MSP receptor sites are occupied, MSP- FITC binding to oocytes is reduced by /C2435% when the VAB-1 EphR is absent ( Miller et al., 2003 ). The remaining binding is due to unidentied MSP domain receptors. Sperm-derivedMSPs and VAP MSP domains bind to identical receptors ex- pressed in oocytes ( Miller et al., 2003; Tsuda et al., 2008 ). We hypothesized that both oocytes and muscle express MSPdomain receptors that transduce signals to mitochondria. Sup- port for this hypothesis comes from examining the effects of extracellular MSP addition to oocyte mitochondria. Microinject-ing into the extracellular spaces of spermless reproductive tracts induces a rapid transition (<15 min) in oocyte mitochondria from ring-shaped to branched,tubular Figures 5 A and 5B; Figures S4 A-S4D). These shape changes, oocytes 2007 are dependent on drp-1 (Figures S4 E and S4F). Identical shape changes in oocyte mitochondria occur when sperm presence is manipulated through mating ( Figure 5 B;Figures S4 B-S4D). Thus, oocytes likely express MSP receptors that rapidly regulate mitochondrial shape. To identify MSP domain receptors important for mitochondria, we compared genome-wide DNA microarray data sets of adulthermaphrodites undergoing oogenesis to undergoing spermatogenesis ( Reinke 2004 ). MSPs bind to plasma membranes, but not to sperm plasma membranes ( Miller et al., 2003 ). From the top 3000 oogenesis/spermatogenesis- enriched genes, we identied 40 genes that encode cell surface receptors ( Table S2 ). These genes are not specically expressed in oocytes; many are also expressed in neurons and muscle. Wescreened RNAi clones corresponding to the 40 predicted recep- tors to identify clones that cause reduced MSP-FITC binding to oocytes and mitochondrial shape or positioning defects inoocytes and muscle ( Table S2 ). The only RNAi clones that affected both MSP binding and muscle mitochondria corre-sponded to the SAX-3 Roundabout (Robo) and CLR-1 Figures Table ;Kokel et al., 1998; Zallen of clr-1 and sax-3 mutants conrmed that both receptors are required for MSP-FITCbinding and muscle mitochondrial morphology (see below).Previous studies have shown that SAX-3 Robo and CLR-1 Lar are expressed in oocytes, motor neurons, and body wall muscle (Chang et al., 2004; Kohara, 2001; Zallen et al., 1998 ). a signicant reduction in MSP- FITC binding to oocytes, similar to loss of the MSP/ephrinreceptor VAB-1 ( Figures 5 C and 5D). To test whether CLR-1 Lar or SAX-3 Robo expression is sufcient to promote MSP binding, we expressed these receptors alone and in combination in cultured HEK293 cells ( Figures 5 E-5G). Expressing the VAB-1EphR in cultured cells confers increased MSP-FITC cell surfacebinding and rapid internalization in live cells ( Miller et al., 2003 ). We found that CLR-1 Lar expression resulted in the same signif-icantly increased level of MSP-FITC and vMSP-FITC binding asthe VAB-1 EphR positive control, whereas Robo expression resulted in a weak increase relative to the negative control ( Fig- ures 5 E-5G). However, expressing both SAX-3 Robo CLR-1 Lar together caused a synergistic increase in MSP and vMSP binding, which could be inhibited by incubating cells with an excess of unlabelled MSP ( Figures 5 E-5G). These data support the model that Robo and Lar function together to promote vMSP binding. Consistent with this idea, SAX-3 and CLR-1 loss synergistically affects human vMSP binding to C. elegans oocytes ( Figures S3 C and S3D). In summary, our screen identi- ed SAX-3 Robo and CLR-1 Lar, perhaps acting via a receptorcomplex, as candidates for mediating VAP signaling to muscle mitochondria. SAX-3 Robo and CLR-1 Lar Function in Muscle specically evaluate muscle mitochondria in sax-3 sax- versus 100% for vpr-1 mutants [n > 400]). The affected to vpr-1 mutants, including abnormally positioned lines of sax-3 mutant muscle show that mitochondria are smaller in diameter thancontrols and mostly displaced from the I-bands, similar tovpr-1 mutants ( Figures 2 A-2C). However, the muscle belly is less swollen than vpr-1 mutants and not all sax-3 mutant muscles are affected, consistent with the presence of a second vMSPreceptor. The sax-3(ky123) mutant defects were rescued with a fosmid containing the sax-3 genomic locus, indicating that the defects are due to loss of SAX-3 Robo ( Figure 6 A). Temper- ature sax-3(ky200)ts hypomorphic temperature allele indicate that sax-3 is required postembryonically ( Figure 6 A). We also tested the gene encod- ing the Slit ligand for SAX-3 Robo and did detect mitochon- drial defects in slt-1(eh15) null mutants ( Figure 6 A). As slt-1 is the only Slit homolog present in C. elegans (Hao et al., 2001 ), SAX-3 does not require Slits for regulating muscle mitochondrial mor- phology. Therefore, sax-3 Robo influences muscle mitochondrial shape and positioning independent of Slit.

Adult sax-3 mutants consumed less oxygen than controls, but contained less total protein, so the interpretation depends on the normalization method ( Figure 6 C). Compared to wild-type controls, sax-3 mutants had reduced ATP concen- tration ( Figure 6 D), increased resistance to paraquat ( Figure 6 E), and slower growth [53.8 \u00b1 3.6 hr for sax-3(ky123) versus 42 hr for wild-type; p < 0.001]. These data indicate that sax-3 mutants have metabolic or mitochondrial defects that are similar to vpr- 1mutants, but most defects are less severe or occur with reduced frequency. sax-3 Robo is expressed in motor neurons and body wall muscle ( Chang et al., 2004; Kohara, 2001; Zallen et al., 1998 ). To test whether sax-3 functions in muscle, we conducted two experiments. In the rst, we expressed SAX-3 specically inmuscle of sax-3(ky123) mutants 3(ky123) muscle defects ( Figure 7 A; rescue observed in 27/31 transgenic worms). Next, we specically depleted SAX-3 in body wall muscle of wild-type worms using an RNAi mosaic strategy ( Durieux et al., 2011; Esposito et al., 2007 ).sid-1 mutants are defective for systemic RNAi, yet undergo cell autonomous RNAi normally ( Winston et al., 2002 ). We specically sax-3 sense and antisense RNAs Muscle-specic sax-3 RNAi caused mitochondrial defects seen in sax-3 mutants ( Fig- ure 7 A). These results indicate that sax-3 functions cell autono- mously in body wall muscle to influence mitochondria. Our RNAi screen also identied the CLR-1 Lar receptor as a muscle mitochondrial regulator.

We con- ducted temperature shift experiments to assess the temporalrequirement of clr-1 function. At the permissive temperature, clr-1(e1745)ts adult muscles contain mostly tubular mitochon- dria similar to the wild-type. When young adults were shiftedto the restrictive temperature for 12 hr, globular mitochondriawere observed similar to clr-1 RNAi animals ( Figure 6 A). These results demonstrate that CLR-1 Lar is required in adults tomaintain mitochondrial elongation on the I-bands. To testwhether clr-1 functions in muscle, we specically depleted clr-1 in body wall muscle using the sid-1 mutant RNAi mosaic strategy. Muscle-specic CLR-1 depletion caused the samemitochondrial defects those seen in clr-1 RNAi and clr-1(e1745) hypodermis- specic clr-1 RNAi caused fluid accumulation, but not muscle mitochondrial defects (data not shown). Taken together, thedata indicate that SAX-3 Robo and CLR-1 Lar function in to influence mitochondria. VPR-1 and SAX-3 Robo Antagonize CLR-1 Lar Signaling Our data indicate that SAX-3 Robo and CLR-1 Lar function in muscle, yet their mutant phenotypes are clearly different ( Fig- Figure 7. sax-3 Robo and clr-1 Lar Site of Action and Signaling Hierarchy (A) Muscle mitochondrial networks in wild-type control and mutant hermaphrodites.

To examine the signaling hierarchy between vpr-1 and sax-3 ,w e compared single and double null mutant strains. TEMs show that mitochondrial shape, including cross-sectional area, and positions in the double mutants areidentical to single null vpr-1 mutants (Table S1 , lines 2 and 5, p > 0.1; data not shown). In addition, ATP concentra- tion in vpr-1(tm1411); sax-3(ky123) double than sax-3(ky123) null mutants ( Figure 6 D). Unfortunately, we were unable to generate mitoGFP transgeniclines in the double mutants. Taken together with the binding data, the results support the model that vMSPs positively regu- late SAX-3 Robo. Robo receptors antagonize Lar receptor signaling during C. elegans and Drosophila growth cone guidance decisions (Chang et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2000 ). Consistent with this the globular Robo mutants (Figures 1E and compared clr-1 mutants to ( Figure 7 A;Table vpr-1(tm1411); clr-1 RNAi mutants distribution to mitochondria in wild-type hermaphrodites. Importantly, they are also positioned , line potential and mobility defects of vpr-1 mutants ( Figure 7 B and data not shown). Thus, muscle mito- chondria in vpr-1(tm1411); clr-1 RNAi animals are largely normal. This important result indicates that excess CLR-1 activity specif-ically causes the vpr-1 mutant muscle mitochondrial defects. Hence, VPR-1 antagonizes Lar signaling in muscle. Moreover, a redundant mechanism must exist that positions mitochondria in the absence of VPR-1 and CLR-1.Developmental Cell VAPB and Mitochondria Developmental Cell 22, 348-362, February 14, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. 357 COURSE BOOK PAGE 41The data support the model that SAX-3 Robo helps vMSPs antagonize CLR-1 Lar signaling. To further test this model, we generated clr-1(e1745)ts; sax-3(ky123) double mutants that express mitoGFP. The mitochondrial branching and elongation defects caused by sax-3 loss are suppressed in the double mutant adults ( Figure 7 A). Furthermore, mitochondria in the double mutants localize correctly to the I-bands. Therefore,VPR-1 and SAX-3 Robo antagonize CLR-1 Lar signaling in muscle to position mitochondria at I-bands. The simplest inter-pretation is that SAX-3 Modulates the Arp2/3 Complex Robo and Lar-like growth cone guidance receptors regulate the actin cytoskeleton, which can influence mitochondrial localiza- tion, either through direct interactions with F-actin or myosin Figure 8.

To examine actin distribution in body wall muscle, we expressed the lamentous actin binding domain of moe- sin fused to GFP ( Figure 8 A). In wild-type muscle, actin was observed in parallel arrays comprising the thin laments, an I- band component. Little lamentous actin was observed in the muscle belly. Whileno difference in actin was observed in the sarcomeres of wild-type and vpr-1 mutant muscle, the latter had extensive actin networks within the muscle belly(Figure 8 A). These ectopic actin networks occupy the same position as mitochon-dria, suggesting that their locations aremechanistically linked. Consistent with this idea, RNAi of genes encoding regula- tors of the actin cytoskeleton, includingknown downstream mediators of and Lar muscle mitochondrial defects ( Figure S5 ). The Arp2/3 complex promotes nucleation and branching. Given thebranched lament networks in vpr-1 mutant muscle bellies, we hypothesizedthat aberrant Arp2/3 activity in the belly displaces mitochondria from I-bands, contributing to the mitochondrial defects. To test this hypoth- esis, we used deplete mitoGFP imaging and vpr-1(tm1411); arx-2 RNAi muscle indicate that large I-bands ( Figure 2 D;Table S1 , lines 2 and Hence, aberrant Arp2/3 activity causes the VAP mutant mitochondrial defects. The Arp2/3 and CLR-1 Larsuppression data provide unequivocal evidence that these mito- chondrial defects are specic and regulatory in nature. Finally, Arp2/3 inactivation in wild-type muscle causes mitochondrialmorphology similar to those seen following Lar inactivation ( Fig- ure 8 B;Table S1 , lines 8 and 4). These data support the model that vMSP/Robo/Lar signaling modulates Arp2/3 activity 358 Developmental Cell 22, 348-362, February 14, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. COURSE BOOK PAGE 42DISCUSSION EphR, Robo, and Lar-like receptors are called growth cone guidance receptors because of their established roles in regu-lating the actin cytoskeleton during nervous system develop- ment. However, these receptors are also expressed after guid- ance decisions are made, particularly in the adult centralnervous system and muscles ( Longo et al., 1993; Zabolotny et al., 2001; Zhang and Goldstein, 1991 ). Here, we show that Robo and Lar-like receptor pathways act in adults to modulatemitochondrial localization and morphology. Our results andthose from previous studies support the following model ( Fig- ure 8 C). VAP MSP domains are cleaved in the neuron cytoplasm and secreted into the external environment. vMSPinteractions with Robo and Lar receptors downregulate Lar signaling to the Arp2/3 complex in muscle, stabilizing mito- chondria at the musclebelly that displace mitochondria from the I-bands, promote mitochondrial mobility, elongation, and branching, and inhibit energy metabolism. We propose that vMSPs restrict Arp2/3activity to the I-bands, thereby influencing mitochondrial morphology and ssion/fusion balance. This neuron-governed mechanism may regulate energy metabolism in response toenvironmental, nutritional, or developmental cues. Evidence for the model and implications for neurodegenerative diseases are discussed below. We show that VAPs and sperm-derived MSPs comprise an evolutionarily and morphology. VAP, Robo, and Lar homologsare present in sponges, animals without neurons and muscles,suggesting that their role in regulating mitochondria is ancestral to their growth cone guidance function ( Srivastava et al., 2010 ). The mechanism by which vMSPs regulate mitochondria appears similar to the mechanism by which Slit repels migrating axons (Chang et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2000 ). During nervous system development, Slit binding to Robo downregulates Lar receptor signaling that promotes migration. Therefore, Robo acts upstream of Lar. We show that Robo is required for vMSP signaling upstream of Lar. The simplest interpretation of ourgenetic and binding data is that Robo facilitates vMSP bindingto Lar or Robo/Lar complexes, downregulating Lar signaling. However, determining the extent to which high afnity vMSP interactions depend upon receptor complex formation willrequire further investigation. Given that EphR, Robo, and Lar receptors are broadly expressed throughout the nervous system, it is possible that vMSPs influence along axons ( Hollenbeck and Saxton, 2005 ). Therefore, neurons may secrete factors like VAPB that regulate mitochon-dria in muscles and neurons. The actin cytoskeleton regulates mitochondrial position in C. elegans muscle, cultured Drosophila and chick neurons, cultured mammalian cells, and yeast ( Boldogh and Pon, Starr and Han, 2002 ). The worm ANC-1 protein is thought to couple actin mitochondria Starr Han, 2002 ). We show that vMSPs promote mitochondrial docking at muscle I-bands, actin-enriched sites containing structures analogous to focal adhesions ( Lecroisey et al., 2007 ). CLR-1 Lar and are required for maintenance or elongation of mitochondrial tubules along I-bands, a process that may facilitate (and/or require) fusion. In vpr-1 mutants, mitochondria mislocalize to the muscle belly along with ectopic actin laments and formthin elongated branches with increased mobility, increased fusion/ssion balance, and reduced transmembrane potential. Lar or Arp2/3 inactivation suppresses these defects, revealingan unexpected role for the actin cytoskeleton in modulating multiple aspects of mitochondrial biology. Whether Arp2/3 regulates mitochondria directly or indirectly through positioningor docking effects is not clear. The actin cytoskeleton has been shown to influence mitochondrial ssion in cultured cells (De Vos et al., 2005; Pathak et al., 2010 ). vMSP signals are likely regulatory in nature, as a parallel mechanism promotesmitochondrial positioning in the absence of VAP and Arp2/3 function. Defects in skeletal muscle mitochondria have been impli- cated in the pathology of ALS ( Dupuis et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2010 ). In mutant sod1 transgenic mice, the SOD1 protein aberrantly accumulates in mitochondria ( Wong et al., 1995b; Kong and Xu, 1998 ) and causes skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction that is initiated at the neuromuscular junction ( Zhou et al., 2010 ). Subsarcolemmal aggregates of abnormal mito- chondria with low transmembrane potential are found in skel-etalmuscle of these mice well before the onset of the disease (Zhou et al., 2010 ). ALS patients with a SOD1 mutation also show a muscle mitochondrial oxidative defect ( Corti et al., 2009 ) and sporadic ALS patients have been documented with muscle mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction ( Crugnola et al., 2010 ). Defects in muscle mitochondria may therefore contribute as a primary cause in ALS pathogenesis. Indeed,uncoupling electron transport from ATP synthesis in muscle mitochondria by overexpressing uncoupling protein 1 is suf-cient to initiate motor neuron degeneration ( Dupuis et al., 2009 ). Our results support the hypothesis that secreted vMSPs modulate mitochondrial position through growth cone guidancereceptor pathways. It seems likely that this signaling mechanism plays a role in ALS pathogenesis. The VAPB P56Smutation inhibits wild-type and abnormal mitochondriallocalization, morphology, and function in ALS8 patients. Consis- tent with this model, low VAP levels in sporadic ALS patients andmouse sod1 models correlate widespread mitochondrial abnormalities et al., et al., 1995b ). Moreover, anal- yses of data from whole-genome associated studies have discovered that single nucleotide polymorphisms within genes mediating growth cone guidance, including Robo, Lar, andCdc42 are associated with susceptibility, survival, or onset ofALS ( Lesnick et al., 2008 ). In addition, the discovery that growth cone guidance pathways influence mitochondria may haveimplications for other neurodegenerative muscular atrophy and Parkinson's disease ( Lesnick et al., 2007 ).Developmental Cell VAPB and Mitochondria Developmental Cell 22, 348-362, February 14, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. 359 COURSE BOOK PAGE 43EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Genetics, RNAi, and Plasmids Bristol N2 is the wild-type C. elegans strain. Worms were maintained on NGM plates with NA22 bacteria at 20/C14C except where indicated otherwise. Strain construction and marker scoring were performed as previously describedusing PCR and phenotypic analyses (Miller et al., 2003; Tsuda et al., 2008 ). The fog-2(q71) mutation was used to generate male/female strains. RNAi was performed by the feeding method using HT115 bacterial strains ( Kamath et al., 2003 ). Positive clones were sequenced for conrmation. See the Supple- mental Experimental Procedures for additional information. Staining, Microinjection, were labeled using MitoTracker staining, dyes NGM plates (Labrousseet al., 1999 ). Imaging was done without anesthetics on dried 2% agarose pads immediately after mounting. Anesthetics can cause mitochondrial frag-mentation. Images were taken using a motorized Zeiss Axioskop 2 with MRMAxiocam Hi-Res digital camera and Perkin Elmer Spinning Disc NikonTE2000 microscope equipped with an EMCCD C9100-50 camera operatedby Velocity 5.3 software. Puried recombinant MSP were microin-jected into the gonad using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope. Injectedanimals were mounted for direct observation after a 15 min to 1 hr recoveryperiod. Transgenics To generate transgenic C. elegans , plasmids (60 ml) were mixed ] (60 ng/ ml) ormyo-3p::mito::GFP (60 ng/ ml) injected into young adult hermaphrodite gonads. The myo-3p::mito::GFP plasmid was generously provided by Dr. van der Bliek. Transgenic lines were selected based on theroller phenotype or GFP expression. Multiple independent transgenic lines were analyzed. Two vpr-1(tm1411)/hT2; unc-119p::vpr-1 transgenic lines were integrated by gamma irradiation. Fluorescence Loss in Photobleaching Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) was achieved with a Perkin ElmerSpinning Disc Nikon TE2000 microscope programmed to cycle betweenbleaching and scanning every 5 s for 4 min. The fluorescence intensities of indi-cated areas were analyzed in Volocity software (Perkin Elmer, UK). Animalswere immobilized on dried 2% agarose pads under conditions that preventanimal and mitochondrial mobility (i.e., one to three animals per pad). Onlymuscles with immobile mitochondria were analyzed. MSP Binding vMSP-FITC were conducted as previouslydescribed (Miller et al., 2003; Tsuda et al., 2008 ). Briefly, HEK293T cells were cultured on coverslips in 6-well plates and cells (/C24 50% confluence) were transfected 2 3xFLAG::SAX-3, CLR- control using FuGENE HD transfection reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega,U.S.A). The 3 3FLAG::SAX-3 construct was generously provided by Dr. Joe Culotti. The CLR-1::V5 construct contained the CLR-1 extracellular andtransmembrane domains, but not the phosphatase domains. After 24 hr, cells were incubated with MSP-FITC or vMSP-FITC for 30 min at 23 /C14C and washed three times in 50 ml PBS. Transfected cells were preincubated with a 25-fold molar excess of unlabelled MSP to evaluate specic binding.Fluorescence was measured from linear range exposures using Axiovisionsoftware. Metabolic Assays Resistance to paraquat (Ultra Scientic, oxygen consumption, and MitoTracker CMXRos staining methods aredescribed in Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Oxygen consumption was measured at constant temperature (20 /C14C) using the oxygraph system (Hansatech, UK).Transmission Electron MicroscopyTEM was performed as previously described (Tsuda et al., 2008; Whitten andMiller, 2007 ). Care was taken to ensure that xation occurred rapidly and cross-sections were orthogonal to muscle myolaments. Mitochondria donot consistently localize to I-bands near neuromuscular junctions.

Developmental patterning relies on morphogen gradients, which generally involve feedback loops to buffer against perturbations caused by fluctuations in gene dosage and expression1. Although many gene components involved in such feedback loops have been identied, how they work together to generate a robust pattern remains unclear. Here we study the network of extra-cellular proteins that patterns the dorsal region of the Drosophila embryo by establishing a graded activation of the bone morpho-genic protein (BMP) pathway. W e nd that the BMP activationgradient itself is robust to changes in gene dosage. Compu- tational search for networks that support robustness shows that transport of the BMP class ligands (Scw and Dpp) into thedorsal midline by the BMP inhibitor Sog is the key event in this patterning process. The mechanism underlying robustness relies on the ability to store an excess of signalling molecules in arestricted spatial domain where Sog is largely absent. It requires extensive diffusion of the BMP-Sog complexes, coupled with restricted diffusion of the free ligands. W e show experimentallythat Dpp is widely diffusible in the presence of Sog but tightly localized in its absence, thus validating a central prediction of our theoretical study. Graded activation of the BMP pathway subdivides the dorsal region of Drosophila embryos into several distinct domains of gene expression. This graded activation is determined by a well-charac-terized network of extracellular proteins 2,3, which may diffuse in the perivitelline fluid4that surrounds the embryo (Fig. 1a). The patterning network is composed of two BMP class ligands (Scwand Dpp), a BMP inhibitor (Sog), a Sog (Tld) and an accessory protein (Tsg), all of which are highly conserved in evolution and are used also for patterning the dorso-ventral axis ofvertebrate embryos 5. Previous studies have suggested that pattern- ing of the dorsal region is robust to changes in the concentrations ofmost of the crucial network components. For example, embryosthat contain only one functional allele of scw,sog,tldortsgare viable and do not show any apparent phenotype. Misexpression of scwor oftsgalso renders the corresponding null mutants viable 6-8. T o check whether robustness is achieved at the initial activation gradient, we monitored signalling directly by using antibodies thatrecognize specically an activated, phosphorylated intermediate ofletters to nature NATURE | VOL 419 | 19 SEPTEMBER 2002 | www.nature.com/nature 304 \u00a9 2002 Nature Publishing Group COURSE BOOK PAGE 47the BMP pathway (pMad)9,10. Prominent graded activation in the dorsal-most eight cell rows was observed for about 1 h, starting roughly 2 h after fertilization at 25 8C (ref. 11 and Fig. 1b). We quantied this activation gradient in heterozygous mutants thatwere compromised for one of three of the crucial components of the patterning network, Scw, Sog or Tld. Whereas homozygous null mutants that completely lack the normal gene product have a deleterious effect on signalling 11, the heterozygotes, which should produce half the amount of the gene product, were indistinguish-able from wild type (Fig. 1c). Similarly, overexpression of the Tld protein uniformly in the embryo did not alter the activation prole (Fig. 1c). The activation prole at 18 8C was the same as that at 25 8C (Fig. 1d). This robustness to temperature variations is marked,considering the wide array of temperature dependencies that are observed in this temperature span. By contrast, the prole of pMad was sensitive to the concentration of Dpp 11(Fig. 1d). The dosage sensitivity of Dpp is exceptional among morphogens and is singledout as being haploid-insufcient 12. No apparent transcriptional feedback, which might account forthe robustness of dorsal patterning, has been identied so far.Robustness should thus be reflected in the design of interactions in the patterning network. T o identify the mechanism underlying robustness, we formulated a general mathematical model of the dorsal patterning network. For simplicity, our initial analysis was restricted to a single BMP class ligand (Scw or Dpp), a BMP inhibitor (Sog) and the protease (Tld). The general model accounted for the formation of the BMP-Sog complex, allowed for the diffusion of Sog, BMP and BMP-Sog, and allowed for the cleavage of Sog by Tld, both when Sog is free and when Sog is associated with BMP . Each reaction was characterized by a different rate constant. The three reaction-diffusion equations that dene this model are given in the Methods. We carried out extensive simulations to identify robust networks. At each simulation, a set of parameters (rate constants and protein Figure 1 Robustness of the pMad activation prole. a, Cross-section of an early Drosophila embryo ( ,2 h after egg lay) showing the three distinct domains of gene expression.

The activation prole is shown in adorsal view of a wild-type embryo at stage 5. Activation is graded and peaks at the dorsal midline. The pattern of pMad widens at the termini of the embryo, possibly owing to edge effects that modify patterning. Our analysis is focused on the centre of the embryo, wherethe variability between different embryos is limited ( ,2 cells). c, Normalized activation prole of wild-type embryos (averaged over n\u008811 embryos) compared with that of three sets of heterozygous mutants containing half the embryos overexpressing the Tld protein uniformly around the embryo, using the Mat a4-Gal4 driver, is also shown ( n\u008833). All embryos were collected at 25 8C.d, Activation proles at 25 8C and 18 8C(n\u008841). This temperature variation is biologically signicant, as development is about two times slower at 18 8C than at 25 8C. Embryos were collected at different times but at the same developmental stage for the two temperatures. Shown also is the activation prole of anembryo carrying three copies of the dppgene.Box 1 Mechanism underlying robustness We consider an idealized patterning network that consists of a single BMP (Scw for simplicity), Sog and Tld. Robustness will be manifested in the steady-state distribution of Scw. We assume that free Scw does not diffuse and that free Sog is not cleaved. The set of reaction-diffusion equations dening this network is obtained from equations 1-3 (Methods), by setting DBMP\u0088aS\u0088k2b\u00880:At steady-state, the system can then be reduced to a single equation: 0\u008872 \u0089Scw\u008a21\u008622l22 b 1\u0086 and kbis the binding rate of Sog to Scw. Thus, although free Scw does not diffuse, the system is tuned for providing it with an effective diffusion. Two processes govern this effective diffusion: the shuttling of Scw by Sog from the circumference of the embryo into the dorsal midline, and the degradation of Sog by Tld in the dorsal region. Although both processes depend on the amounts of the respective proteins, those concentrations do not appear in the effective Scw diffusion. The key to this quantitative adjustment is the fact that both processes aremediated by the complex Sog-Scw: only the complex, and not free Scw, can diffuse, and only the complex is subject to degradation by Tld. The concentrations of the network components, Scw, Sog and Tld could still affect the steady-state activation gradient through the boundary conditions. The solution of equation (1) is given by \u0089Scw x\u0086\u008a\u0088l2 b x2\u008712 2\u0086 where and 1is an integration coefcient. In general, the value of 1will depend on most parameters of the system, including the concentrations and the production rates of the network components Scw, Sog and Tld, leading to a nonrobust distribution of Scw. Examining equation (2), however, we note that the only way to accommodate high concentrations of Scw is by placing Scw in a small region surrounding the dorsal midline where Sog is absent, in other words, by setting 1to 0. Thus, for large enough concentrations of Scw, 1vanishes and we obtain a robust Scw prole: b x2 3\u0086 for every xthat is far enough from the dorsal midline, in other words, x. .1. Indeed, the concentrations of network components have disappeared from this equation of the activation prole, which reflects the robustness of the system. Finally, we note that the same mechanism generates the gradient of the second BMP (Dpp). We assume, however, that Dpp binds Sog only when the latter is bound to Tsg. Thus, the same formalism is applied but with the molecular entities Dpp, Sog-Tsg (instead of Sog) and the complex Dpp-Sog-Tsg (instead of Scw-Sog). The details and precise conditions necessary for robustness are given in the Supplementary Information.letters to nature NATURE | VOL 419 | 19 SEPTEMBER 2002 | www.nature.com/nature 305 \u00a9 2002 Nature Publishing Group COURSE BOOK PAGE 48concentrations) was chosen at random and the steady-state acti- vation prole was calculated by solving equations (1) to (3) numerically. A set of three perturbed networks representing hetero- zygous situations was then generated by reducing the gene dosages ofsog,tldor the BMP class ligand by a factor of two. The steady-state activation proles dened by those networks were solved numeri-cally and compared with the initial, nonperturbed network. A threshold was dened as a given BMP value (corresponding to the value at a third of the dorsal ectoderm in the nonperturbed network). The extent of network robustness was quantied by measuring the shift in the threshold for all three perturbed net- works. Over 66,000 simulations were carried out, with each of the nine parameters allowed to vary over four orders of magnitude. As expected, in most cases (97.5%) the threshold position in the perturbed networks was shifted by a large extent ( .50%; see Fig. 2a). In most of those nonrobust cases, the BMP concentrationwas roughly uniform throughout the dorsal region (Fig. 2c). By contrast, Sog was distributed in a concentration gradient with itsminimum in the dorsal midline, dening a reciprocal gradient ofBMP activation. Thus, the key event in this nonrobust patterning mechanism was the establishment of a concentration gradient of Sog, which was governed by diffusion of Sog from its domain of expression outside the dorsal region, coupled with its cleavage by Tld inside the dorsal region. Although such a gradient has been observed 13, it is also compatible with other models (see below). We identied a small class of networks (198 networks, 0.3%) in which a twofold reduction in the amounts of all three genes resulted in a change of less than 10% in the threshold position (see Fig. 2b). Notably, in all of these robust cases, BMP was redistributed in a sharp concentration gradient that peaked in the dorsal midline (Fig. 2c). In addition, this concentration gradient decreased as a power- low distribution with an exponent n\u00882, which indicated the uniqueness of the robust solution (Fig. 2d). In these cases, Sogwas also distributed in a graded manner in the dorsal region (data not shown). Analysis of the reaction rate constants of the robust networks showed a wide range of possibilities for most parameters. But two restrictions were apparent and dened the robust networkdesign. First, in the robust networks the cleavage of Sog by Tld was facilitated by the formation of the complex Sog-BMP (Fig. 2f). Second, the complex BMP-Sog was broadly diffusible, whereas free BMP was restricted (Fig. 2e). T o identify how robustness is achieved, we considered an ideal- ized network by assuming that free Sog is not cleaved and that free BMP does not diffuse. The steady-state activation prole dened by this network can be solved analytically (Box 1), which reveals the two aspects that are crucial for ensuring robustness. First, the BMP- Sog complex has a central role, by coupling the two processes that establish the activation gradient: BMP diffusion and Sog degra- dation. This coupling leads to a quantitative buffering of pertur- bations in gene dosage. Second, restricted diffusion of free BMP enables the system to store excess BMP in a conned spatial domain where Sog is largely absent.

In all of the robust cases, a high ratio ( .10) was observed. By contrast, the low ratios observed in the nonrobust cases indicated that BMP was distributed approximately uniformly. d, The steady-state prole of free BMP was t to a power-low distribution, x 2n.

We next examined the complete system, comprising Sog, Tld, Tsg, both Scw and Dpp, and their associated receptors (Supplemen- tary Information). Two additional molecular assumptions wererequired to ensure the robustness of patterning. First, Sog can bind and capture the BMP class ligands even when the latter are associated with their receptors. Second, Dpp can bind Sog only when the latter is bound to Tsg. Indeed, it has been shown that, whereas Sog is sufcient for inhibiting Scw, both Tsg and Sog arerequired for inhibiting Dpp 6,14,15. This last assumption implies that Tsg functions to decouple the formation of the Scw gradient fromthe parallel generation of the Dpp gradient, ensuring that Scw and Dpp are transported to the dorsal midline independently by two distinct molecular entities (Supplementary Information). The complete model was solved numerically for different choices of rate constants. In particular, we assessed the effect of twofoldchanges in gene dosage. The steady-state activation proles can be superimposed, indicating the robustness of the system (Fig. 3a, b). In addition, with the exception of Dpp, the expression of all other crucial network components can be altered by at least an order of magnitude before an effect on the position of a given threshold is observed (Fig. 3c, d). In the model, the lack of robustness to Dpp stems from its insufcient dosage. Note that the time taken to reach steady state issensitive to these concentrations of protein (Fig. 3e). For the wide range of parameters that we have used, however, the adjustment time does not exceed the patterning time. Flexible adjustment time thus facilitates the buffering of quantitative perturbations. As discussed above, our analysis identied two principle mol- ecular features that are essential for robust network design: rst, freeSog is not cleaved efciently \u2014an assumption that is supported by the in vitro nding that Sog cleavage by Tld requires BMP6,16; second, the diffusion of free BMP is restricted. This is the central prediction of our theoretical study, namely, that Scw diffusion requires Sog, whereas Dpp diffusion requires both Sog and Tsg. Although several reports suggest that in wild-type embryos bothDpp and Scw are widely diffusible 6,17, their ability to diffuse in a sog ortsgmutant background has not been examined as yet. T o monitor the diffusion of Scw or Dpp, we used the even-skipped (eve) stripe-2 enhancer ( st2) to misexpress Dpp or Scw in a narrow stripe perpendicular to the normal BMP gradient. In transgenicembryos, dpp orscwRNA was detected in a stripe just posterior to the cephalic furrow. Initially the stripe was about 12 cells wide atearly cleavage cycle 14, but rened rapidly to about 6 cells by late cycle 14 (Fig. 4a, b). The st2-dppand st2-scwembryos were viable, despite the high expression of these proteins as compared with theirendogenous counterparts. The activation of the BMP pathway was monitored either by staining for pMad or by following dorsal expression of the targetgene race, which requires high activation. Scw is a less potent ligand than is Dpp. This experimental setup could not be used to study Scwdiffusion properties because expressing st2-scw did not alter the pattern of pMad or race expression in wild-type or sog 2/2embryos (data not shown). By contrast, expression of st2-dpp led to an expansion of both markers in a region that extends far from the st2 expression domain, indicating a wide diffusion of Dpp in a wild-type background (compare Fig. 4c, d with 4e, f). Conversely, on expression of st2-dppinsog2/2or in tsg2/2embryos, both markers were conned to a narrow stripe in the st2domain (compare Fig. 4g, h and k, l with 4i, j and m, n, respectively). The width of this stripewas comparable to that of st2-dppexpression, ranging from 6 to 12 cells, indicating that Dpp does not diffuse from its domain ofexpression in the absence of Sog or Tsg. Taken together, these results show that both Sog and Tsg are required for Dpp diffusion, as predicted by the theoretical analysis. The computation ability of biochemical networks is striking when one considers that they function in a biological environment a c e g i k mb d f h j l ndpp Tsg. Dpp was expressed orthogonal to the dorso- ventral axis by the eve st2 enhancer in a stripe of about 12 cells at early cleavage cycle 14 (a), which renes to about 6 cells by late cycle 14 (lateral views, b). Note that ectopic amounts of dppwere greater than the endogenous transcripts in the dorsal region, which under these exposures were not visible. c, Normal pattern of racein wild-type embryos. Note the AP bias in the anterior positions (arrowheads). d, Normal pattern of pMad in wild- type embryos. e, Expression of st2-dppin wild-type embryos leads to an expanded expression of race, which forms a wedge shape with its broadest region at the position of st2-dpp(arrow) and ranges about 25 cells posteriorly (asterisk). The normal pattern of race shows an AP bias at the anterior positions (arrowheads). f,st2-dppin wild-type embryos also leads to a broader dorsal distribution of pMad, which extends throughout the AP axis. g,I nsog2/2embryos, the anterior racedomain expands (arrowheads), whereas posterior expression is diminished and detected only sporadically as a punctate staining.Some expansion of race was observed in sog \u0087/2embryos, probably due to the higher threshold of raceinduction compared with pMad. h,I nsog2/2embryos, pMad expands in the dorsal domain, but does not reach the ventral domain. i, Expression of st2-dppin sog2/2embryos leads to a corresponding stripe of race of about 10-12 cells (arrow). j,st2-dppinsog2/2embryos generates a corresponding stripe of pMad (arrow), which extends to the ventral region. The ventral expansion of pMad versus the restricted dorsalexpansion of race in embryos of the same genotype indicates that a lower threshold of activation can induce pMad even in the ventral domain, which is devoid of endogenousDpp. Main view is ventral, inset is lateral. k,l, The patterns of raceand tsg 2/2 embryos are similar to sog2/2embryos. m,n,st2-dppintsg2/2generates a corresponding stripe of both race and pMad, similar to that observed on expression of st2-dppinsog2/2embryos.

Studies have examined the effect of these properties on cellular computation mechanisms18-20,a n d robustness has been proposed to be a 'design principle' of bio-chemical networks 18,21. We have shown the applicability of this principle to morphogen gradient patterning during early develop-ment. Quantitative analysis can be used to assess rigorously the robustness of different patterning models and to exclude incompa- tible ones. The remaining, most plausible model points to crucial biological assumptions and serves to postulate the central feedback mechanisms. Applying the same modelling principles to other systems might identify additional 'design principles' that underlie robust patterning by morphogen gradients in development. A Methods Fly strains We used the following strains: screw12,sog6,tolloid2,tolloid7,U A S - tld(provided by M. O'Connor), Mat a4-Gal4 VP16 (provided by D. St. Johnston) and tsgXB56(provided by L. Marsh). For altering the number of copies of dpp, we used the strain dpp1846sp cn bw / CyO 23P[dpp\u0087](provided by S. Roth), which was crossed to wild-type flies. The mutant chromosomes were maintained over a balancer chromosome. When each strain is crossed to itself, two-thirds of the embryos not showing the null phenotype should beheterozygotes for scwand tld, and a third for sog. The st2-dppstrain has been described 17. We constructed st2-scwby inserting a scwcDNA fragment into plasmid 22FPE (ref. 22). Antibodies and staining Rabbit antibodies against pMad were kindly provided by P . ten Dijke. Freshly collected embryos were xed in 7% formaldehyde. The remaining steps of staining were done according to standard procedures. We used Cy2-conjugated secondary antibodies againstrabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Data analysis The dorso-ventral activation prole was quantied by using image processing toolswritten in Matlab. The mean intensity was measured at the middle of the anterior- posterior (AP) axis in a swath that was 20 cells wide in the direction of the AP axis. We then averaged the results over the indicated number of embryos. Numerical simulations For the general patterning model we considered a single BMP , which is denoted here as Scw. The model was dened by in the region 21,x,1. The parameters in this model include the diffusion coefcients of Sog, Scw and the complex Scw-Sog, ( DS,DBMP in associated with Scw), a constant flux of Sog on the boundaries ( hs) and the total Scw concentration ([Scw] av).DCisDBMP-Sog in Fig. 2e. We solved the equations for 66,000 different sets of random parameters. Each parameter wasallowed to vary over four orders of magnitude. The parameters dening the centre of this distributions are (in arbitrary units): D S\u0088l1\u0088\u0089Scw\u008aav\u00881;DBMP\u00880.1,DC\u00881, kb\u008810,k2b\u00881,l[Tld]\u008810,a[Tld]\u008810,hS\u008810. Equations were solved with Matlab. Each run took less than 1 min. The parameters of the systems shown in Fig. 2 arespecied in the Supplementary Information. For the parameters of the full model (Fig. 3), we chose diffusion rates that reflected the rapid in vivo patterning time and corresponded to the measured diffusion time in the perivitelline fluid 4. This measured diffusion coefcient is similar to that of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in water23. It is possible that mixing processes in the perivitelline fluid contribute to the equilibration process. For simplicity, we approximate such processes as an effective diffusion. This approximation does not affect our conclusions. No biochemical data restricting the values of the other parameters are available. The parameters of the reference system are within the realistic biochemical range and obey the robustness conditions. The parameter choice is specied and rationalized in detail in theSupplementary Information. Received 11 April; accepted 27 July 2002; doi:10.1038/nature01061. 1. Freeman, M.

When morphogen productionis spatially restricted, diffusion and degradation aresufcient to generate sharp concentration gradients.It is less clear how sharp gradients can arise within the source of a broadly expressed morphogen. A recent solution relies on localized production of aninhibitor outside the domain of morphogen produc-tion, which effectively redistributes (shuttles) andconcentrates the morphogen within its expressiondomain. Here, we study how a sharp gradient is es-tablished without a localized inhibitor, focusing onearly dorsoventral patterning of the Drosophila embryo, where an active ligand and its inhibitor areconcomitantly generated in a broad ventral domain.Using theory and experiments, we show that asharp Toll activation gradient is produced through''self-organized shuttling,'' which inhibitor production of the acti-vating ligand Spa \u00a8tzle. Shuttling may represent a general paradigm for patterning early embryos. INTRODUCTION Morphogens are signaling molecules that can induce several cell fates in a concentration-dependent manner ( Wolpert, 1989 ). Gradients of morphogens are instrumental in patterning tissues and organs during the development of multicellular organisms, raising interest in the molecular networks establishing these gradients. In the standardparadigm, a morphogen that is secretedfrom a localized source establishes a gradient that peaks at thesource merely by its diffusion and degradation across the eld. Quantitative properties of such gradients are well understood: morphogen spread is dened by the diffusion and degradationrates, and the sensitivity of the gradient to perturbations can be tuned by feedbacks acting on these parameters ( Bollenbach et al., 2005 ;Eldar et al., 2003 ;Paulsen et al., 2011 ;Schier, 2009 ). Classical examples of morphogen gradients conform to this paradigm, including the Bicoid and Dpp gradients in disc ( Cadigan, 2002 ;Lecuit et al., 1996 ;Nellen et al., 1996 ), respectively. However, there are also examples where amorphogen is uniformly produced within a wide region, but its graded signaling is conned to a narrow domain that is wellwithin the region of morphogen production. This paradigm is prevalent at early stages of embryogenesis, where broad domains have been dened, but the narrow territory responsiblefor local production of graded signals has not yet been gener-ated. Quantitative properties of such gradients are less under- stood. Of particular interest are mechanisms that enable the generation of a sharp gradient and maintain its distributionrobust to fluctuations in gene dosages or environmental conditions. Previously, we analyzed this paradigm of a broadly expressed morphogen in the context of the BMP activation gradient in theearly Drosophila embryo, which is formed well within the domain in which the activating ligand, Dpp, is expressed (dorsal /C2440% of the embryo) ( Eldar et al., 2002 ). Formation of the BMP activation gradient relies on the production of an inhibitor molecule (Sog) in regions flanking the dorsal domain where Dpp is produced. Sogis secreted, diffuses into the dorsal domain, and generates aninhibition gradient. Work by us and others described a novel shuttling mechanism for the formation of this activation gradient: rather than passively inhibiting BMP signaling, the diffusible fluxof Sog serves to redistribute the Dpp molecules, concentrating the ligand in the dorsal-most region ( Eldar et al., 2002 ;Mizutani et al., 2005 ;Shimmi et al., 2005 ;Wang and Ferguson, 2005 ). Theoretical analysis suggested that shuttling provides two advantages: rst, it leads to a sharp gradient; second, it enhances the robustness of the gradient to fluctuations in genedosage ( Eldar et al., 2002 ;Meinhardt and Roth, shut- tling mechanism is conserved in short-germband insects ( van der Zee et al., 2006 ), and we recently provided evidence that shuttling functions also in the early Xenopus embryo, again in generating a BMP activation gradient ( Ben-Zvi et al., 2008 ;Plou- hinec et al., 2011 ). Notably, redistribution of ligand molecules via shuttling does not involve directed transport but depends onlyon nondirected diffusion. In the aforementioned example of the BMP activation gradient, expression of an inhibitor outside the patterned domainserves as the key asymmetry cue and is the critical factor in generating a sharp and robust gradient through ligand shuttling. 1016 Cell150, 1016-1028, August 31, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. COURSE BOOK PAGE 52Yet in other cases, such asymmetry may not exist, and gradient formation within the broad expression domain will need to be es- tablished without the assistance of external cues. We wished to examine how a sharp gradient is established in these cases andwhether similar principles apply. The transmission of dorsoventral (DV) polarity from the Drosophila oocyte to the embryo is a case in point ( Moussian and Roth, 2005 ). During oogenesis, the ventral 40% of the follicle cell layer surrounding the oocyte is patterned by the EGF receptor pathway to express the gene pipe, encoding a sulfo- transferase ( Anderson, 1998 ;James et al., 2002 ;Morisato and Anderson, 1995 ;Peri et al., 2002 ;Sen et al., 1998 ;Stein, 1995 ). Modication by Pipe is thought to activate proteins, which are deposited on the vitelline membrane covering the oocyte and the future embryo ( Sen et al., 1998 ;Zhang et al., 2009 ;Zhu et al., 2007 ). Following fertilization, the ventral domain of the vitelline membrane, which was dened by pipe expression, guides the subsequent polarity of the embryo by facilitating a proteolyticcascade within the perivitelline space ( Figure 1 ), which culmi- nates in the processing and activation of Spa \u00a8tzle (Spz), a ligand of the Toll (Tl) receptor ( Cho et al., 2012 ;DeLotto and DeLotto, 1998 ;DeLotto et al., 2001 ;Dissing et al., 2001 ;LeMosy et al., 1999 ;Morisato and Anderson, 1994 ;Schneider et al., 1994 ; Weber et al., 2003 ). Binding of processed Spz to the Tl receptor on the embryonic plasma membrane activates a signaling pathway within theembryo, whose outcome is the graded nuclear localization ofthe transcription factor Dorsal (Dl) within embryonic nuclei (Roth et al., 1989 ;Rushlow et al., 1989 ;Stathopoulos and Levine, 2002 ). Notably, this ventral-to-dorsal gradient is generated well within the pipe domain. Thus, whereas pipe is found uniformly along the ventral 40% of the egg chamber, Dl appears fullynuclear in less than 20% of the circumference and becomes progressively cytoplasmic dorsally. Moreover, gene expressionboundaries, such as those dening the expression domains of the high-Dl target genes twist (twi) and snail (sna), are also found at the ventral /C2420% ( Rusch and Levine, 1996 ;Stathopoulos and Levine, 2002 ;Zhao et al., 2007 ). Evidence further suggests thatelaboration of the wide pipe domain into a narrower gradient of Tl activation involves a self-organization circuit because ex- panding the pipe domain to /C2480% of the follicle cells results in a two-peak gradient ( Morisato, 2001 and Roth, 2005 Schu \u00a8pbach, 1994 ). However, how this self- organization is encoded by the molecular machinery remainsunknown. We searched computationally for mechanisms that can generate a sharp and robust gradient within the expression A B C D Figure 1.

We show that a simple model, which relies only on the diffusion of the ligand outside its expression domain, does not sufce. Based on reported properties of the Spz ligand ( and ;Morisato, 2001 ;Weber et al., 2003 ), we consider the case where the diffusing morphogen is cleaved to generate an inhibitor that can either inhibit ligand activity or compete for receptor binding. This scenario, however, doesnot sufce for sharpening the gradient. Rather, we again identify an inhibitor-mediated shuttling mechanism as a way for producing a sharp and robust gradient. Notably, in this casethe inhibitor is not produced outside the domain of morphogen expression but, instead, is generated concomitantly with the ligand following its cleavage. Shuttling emerges as a self-orga-nized property of the dynamics, with polar inhibitor productionestablished in a self-consistent manner. Key assumptions of this model are based on known biochemical properties of Spz cleavage ( Weber et al., 2007 ), and we demonstrate the consis- tency of the mechanism with published genetic experiments, including the observed formation of a double peak when the pipe expression domain is expanded. We further provide exper- imental evidence demonstrating multiple facets of the ligand Spz following cleavage and the capacity to polarize the DV axis ac- cording to the flux of the inhibitory Spz prodomain, all consistentwith use of shuttling by the early DV patterning network. RESULTS Computational Model: Searching for a Mechanism that Establishes a Sharp and Robust Morphogen Gradient We consider a morphogen that is produced in a wide region andexamine the gradient of morphogen level that is established within this domain of expression. As a concrete case, we assume the morphogen production domain is restricted to 40% of theembryonic circumference, matching the observed extent of the pipe domain where activated Spz is produced ( Peri et al., 2002 ).In addition, the rst gene expression boundary is established at 20% circumference, matching the expression boundary of the Dl target gene sna. Recent measurements of the Dl gradient have shown that the gradient decays by almost 50% over this 20% spatial range ( Kanodia et al., 2009 ;Liberman et al., 2009 ; Stathopoulos and Levine, 2002 ). To rigorously dene the steep- ness of the gradient (''sharpness''), we measure the relative decayfrom its maximal level, found at x = 0, to its value at the expressionboundary, x = L V/2, L Vbeing the size of the morphogen expres- sion domain, with embryo size normalized to 1. Spz, the Tl-activating ligand, is uniformly processed by proteo- lytic cleavage throughout the pipe domain. The Spz precursor can be cleaved to generate two entities: the C-terminal domain(C-Spz), which functions as an activating ligand ( DeLotto et al., 2001 ;Weber et al., 2003 ); and an N-terminal domain (N-Spz), whose overexpression inhibits ventral fates ( Morisato, 2001 ). The mere diffusion of the activated C-Spz away from the domainof morphogen production could produce a gradient within theproduction domain. However, we noted that such diffusion produced a very shallow gradient ( Figures 2 A-2C). In fact, analyt- ical analysis conrmed that the maximal sharpness that can be achieved by diffusion of C-Spz out of its domain of expression is 9%, a value that renders the gradient highly sensitive to even small fluctuations in the production or degradation rates of themorphogen, and cannot be used to support robust patterning. Furthermore, extending the model to include nonlinear degrada- tion of Spz did not increase the sharpness of the gradient ( Figure S1available online). Similarly, adding cogeneration of the inhibi- tory N-Spz and activating C-Spz was not sufcient for producing a sharp gradient ( Extended Experimental Procedures ). A Self-Organized Shuttling Mechanism Producesa Sharp and Robust Gradient We considered the recently reported observation that followingcleavage of the Spz precursor by the serine protease Easter (Ea), the separate C- and N-terminal parts of Spz remainA B CFigure 2.

This form of the Spz ligand (NC-Spz) can bind and activate the Tl receptor ( Figure 3 A). Binding to the Tl receptor is in fact necessary for the nal disso- ciation of the C- and N-terminal parts, generating a free activator (C-Spz) and inhibitor (N-Spz). We reasoned that this propertymight provide additional regulation of inhibitor production and may sharpen the gradient. We formulated a mathematical model that accounts for this two-step process of free ligand production. The model allowsfor the rebinding of the dissociated N- and C-Spz portions toproduce an inactive complex (NC-Spz*), and considers the endocytosis of Tl following activation ( Lund et al., 2010 ), which is taken as a measure for signaling. A general analytical solution is not available, and we therefore studied the dynamics of the model using numerical simulations. Specically, we searchedsystematically for parameters such as kinetic rate constants and diffusion rates, for which a sharp and robust activation gradient is established. Although most parameters dene a gradient that is rather shallow within the pipe region (x < L V), sharp and robust Figure 3. Formation of a Sharp Gradient by Self-Organized Shuttling (A) Molecular model is shown. Cleavage of Spz by Ea produces an active ligand, NC-Spz. Binding ofNC-Spz to the receptor Tl may lead to eitherinternalization of the active ligand-receptor com-plex, or to its dissociation into two inhibitorymolecules of N-Spz and an active complex of Tlbound to C-Spz. This complex, in turn, mayinternalize or dissociate into a free receptor anda free active ligand, C-Spz.

The threshold for snaexpression is set to half of the maximal signaling level (gray horizontaldashed line).(C) About one million parameter sets were tested,and only 0.04% were found to be consistent sets,forming a sharp (sharpness >0.4) prole that is robust to parameter perturbations. Over 99% of the solutions had sharpness smaller than 0.1.(D and E) Consistent parameter sets, in red, werecharacterized by effectively no diffusion of C-Spz,and faster binding dynamics of C-Spz to Tl thanNC-Spz to Tl (D). N-Spz was degraded muchfaster when in complex with C-Spz, and diffusedslower than the inert NC-Spz* complex. Note that almost all consistent parameter sets (red) display no diffusion of C-Spz (E). Gray dots in (D) and (E) represent biologically valid but nonsharp gradients (ExtendedExperimental Procedures ). (F) Sharp and robust solutions are characterized by shuttling of C-Spz ventrally from its ventro-lateral production domain. Although most solutions displayedalmost no shuttling, sharp and robust solutions had a positive shuttling coefcient. To achieve better statistics, a subsequent screen was run to identify over 3,000parameter sets resulting in shuttling, using parameter characterization in (D) and (E).

This is in marked contrast to models that considered an immediate, one-step separation between N- and C-Spz following cleavage by Ea, where no sharp gradients could be identied ( Extended Experi- mental Procedures ). The sharp solutions were conned to a subset of the parameter space with several characteristics.First, C-Spz did not diffuse freely. Rather it diffused only in asso- ciation with N-Spz, in either the active (NC-Spz) or inactive (NC-Spz*) complexes. Second, the binding and dissociation kinetics between NC-Spz and the Tl receptor were slower than that of thefree C-Spz ( Figure 3 D; note that in all simulations, the dissocia- tion constant [ratio of on versus off rate] was kept the same, inaccordance with experimental results by Weber et al., 2007 ). Inactivation of N-Spz is an important additional feature. In all consistent solutions, N-Spz was inactivated mostly while incomplex with C-Spz, and this inactivation was biased toward the ventral domain dened by pipe expression ( Figure 3 E). One plausible mechanism may involve a protease that cleavesN-Spz in the NC-Spz* complex, to release active C-Spz. Inter- estingly, a Pipe-dependent mechanism by which Gastrulation defective (GD) ventrally restricts the processing of Ea by Snake(Snk) was recently reported by Cho et al. (2012) . This suggests that the protease that carries out the putative cleavage of theinactive complex could potentially be Ea or Snk. The Dynamic Formation of a Sharp Gradient through Self-Organized ShuttlingExamining the consistent solutions that produced a sharp gradient, we noticed that in all cases, the active ligand C-Spz was concentrated toward the ventral midline, x=0 . Thus, the sharp gradient was produced not merely by a graded inhibition of a uniformly produced ligand but by the physical translocation of the ligand toward the center from a broad production domain(Figure 3 F;Extended Experimental Procedures ). As described above, this is the hallmark of a shuttling mechanism ( Eldar et al., 2002 ;Meinhardt and Roth, 2002 ). Furthermore, several of the biochemical properties characterizing the consistentsolutions are dening properties of the canonical shuttling mech- anism: low diffusion of the active ligand C-Spz, facilitation of C-Spz movement by binding to the inhibitor N-Spz, and theenhanced degradation of N-Spz when in complex with C-Spz (Figures 3 D and 3E). Identifying the shuttling mechanism here was surprising to us because shuttling of the ligand by its inhibitor is possible onlywhen there is a flux of inhibitor toward the center. Here, however, Spz is processed within the entire pipe domain. Moreover, the inhibitor is produced following the binding of the processed ligand (NC-Spz) to the receptor, which is expected to occur primarily throughout the ventral pipe expression domain. What then leads to a polarized production of the inhibitor? Examining the dynamics of gradient formation ( Figure 4 ), we noted that initially, the signaling gradient is dominated by theprocessed ligand (NC-Spz), whose distribution is determinedaccording to the simple diffusion model. However, binding of NC-Spz to Tl generates N- and C-Spz, mostly in the pipe domain. Rebinding of N- and C-Spz generates the inert complex (NC-Spz*) that is subsequently degraded in the pipe domain, causing effective degradation of N-Spz in the ventral part ofthe embryo, whereas C-Spz does not diffuse and is depositedventrally. Ventral depletion of N-Spz leads to its accumulationlaterally, outside the pipe domain. The ventral accumulation of C-Spz leads to occupation of the receptors by C-Spz in thisdomain. NC-Spz therefore binds Tl more laterally, releasingN-Spz in a polarized manner and leading to shuttling (animated inPaperFlick ). The gradient can be divided into two regions. The ventralmost part is formed through shuttling and dominated by C-Spz. The sharp prole in this region is characteristic of the shuttling mechanism. The ventro-lateral domain is much flatter Figure 4. Dynamics of Gradient Formation Reveals Self-Organized Shuttling Shown are the spatial proles of the inhibitor, N-Spz (red), the active ligands NC-Spz (light blue) and C-Spz (blue), and the internalized Tl levels (green) intime from early (top) to late (bottom). The signaling gradient is initially domi-nated by NC-Spz, forming a shallow gradient dened by diffusion. N-Spzaccumulates following binding of NC-Spz to Tl. Formation of the inert complexwith C-Spz and the subsequent degradation of the complex in the ventraldomain leads to a dip in N-Spz levels in the lateral domain. A ventral flux ofN-Spz facilitates shuttling and leads to the formation of a sharp C-Spz gradientand further polarization of N-Spz gradient. In the ventral domain of thesignaling gradient, the internalized receptor, becomes gradually dominated byC-Spz, whereas the dorsal and lateral domains are mostly affected by NC-Spz. Note the change of scale in the middle row. See also Figure S3 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. COURSE BOOK PAGE 56because it is formed through diffusion of NC-Spz and dominated by this ligand. Interestingly, this division of the DV axis and the dynamics of the Dl nuclear gradient were recently observed experimentally by Reeves et al. (2012) . Reassociation between the Two Parts of Spz Reassociation between N-Spz and C-Spz plays a crucial role in the model because it provides the means to shuttle C-Spzventrally. To experimentally demonstrate that N-Spz and C-Spz possess the capacity to physically associate, we made use of two constructs: V5-tagged N-Spz fused C terminally to a trans-membrane domain (V5-N-Spz-TM), and a secreted and biologi-cally active signal peptide-C-Spz-GFP fusion protein (SP-C- Spz-GFP) ( Figure 5 A) (Cho et al., 2010 ). HeLa cells expressing membrane-anchored V5-N-Spz-TM were incubated with medium by Drosophila S2 cells that had been trans- fected either with SP-C-Spz-GFP, or with a signal peptide-GFP(SP-GFP) fusion protein, that served as a control. Incubationand washes of the medium were carried out under conditions where endocytosis is inhibited, and the subsequent immunohis- tochemical staining was performed on nonpermeabilized cells,so that only extracellular proteins were detected. A strong GFPsignal was displayed on most cells expressing N-Spz-TM and incubated with secreted SP-C-Spz-GFP (75%), but no such signal could be detected following incubation with the controlmedium ( Figures 5 B and 5C). These observations imply that, as predicted by the model, N- and C-Spz can readily reassociate. The Reassociated N- and C-Spz Complex Is Inactive A second prediction of the model is that the complex generated by reassociated N- and C-Spz (NC-Spz*) is inactive and is, there- fore, functionally distinct from the biologically active NC-Spz,formed immediately after cleavage by Ea. To validate this predic- tion, we sought to test the activity of the reassociated complex in Drosophila embryos. We initially examined alterations in DV fates, following separate overexpression of N- and C-Spz, under control of the maternal driver nos-Gal4 . Expression of SP-C- Spz-GFP in this manner led to a pronounced lateralizing effect. Although the ventralmost mesodermal fates and their positionwere not signicantly altered, the expression domain of the lateral marker intermediate neuroblasts defective (ind) expanded con- siderably, to cover the entire dorsal side of the embryo, whereas dorsal fates, normally marked by expression of dpp, were strongly diminished. In contrast, expression of N-Spz by thesame driver did not give rise to any detectable phenotype atthe level of altered gene expression or cuticle patterns, and the embryos were viable. A marked inhibitory effect of N-Spz was detected, however, following coexpression with SP-C-Spz-GFP. The expanded ind expression induced by SP-C-Spz-GFP was no longer apparent,and dorsal dpp expression was restored ( Figures 5 D-5L). These observations imply formation of a functionally distinct, reassoci- ated complex between N- and C-Spz, which interferes with the capacity of C-Spz to activate the Tl signaling pathway. They further suggest that binding to C-Spz can account for the previ-ously reported inhibitory activity of N-Spz when injected into early embryos ( Morisato, 2001 ).Interestingly, in the ventral region, coexpression of N- and C-Spz in this manner had an attenuating effect, such that theendogenous expression of ventro-lateral genes such as ind was abolished, and expression of the ventral marker snabecame narrower. Because this effect was not observed upon expres-sion of N-Spz alone (where the wild-type pattern was main- tained), it represents an outcome of the reassociated N- andC-Spz complex. We hypothesize that this results from someinteraction with other signaling processes that function in the ventral region, for example through interaction of the NC-Spz* with the Ea protease processing Spz, or by the formation ofhigher-order complexes between the N-Spz and C-Spz that inhibit Tl activation. Self-Organized Shuttling Accounts for Axis Duplication As an additional test of the model, we examined whether it can account for the observation that increasing the pipe expression domain from its endogenous 40% to 80% of the ventral region results in a pattern duplication: the monotonous single-peak gradient observed in wild-type is replaced by a two-peak prolein a signicant portion of the embryos ( Figure 3 G) (Morisato, 2001 ;Moussian and Roth, 2005 ;Roth and Schu \u00a8pbach, 1994 ). Indeed, we could readily identify parameters for which extendingthe region of Spz processing in the model leads to axis duplica-tion ( Figure 3 I). Notably, the resulting ventral minimum between the two peaks is rather shallow and may be close to the threshold value for twi and sna expression. This can explain why only half of the embryos showed axis duplication, whereas the rest showed anexpanded twiexpression domain ( Morisato, 2001 ). Small differ- ences in system parameters between different embryos can result in one embryo exhibiting a single, extended peak, and the other two peaks. The model can also explain the observationthat reduction in spz gene dosage increases the fraction of embryos with two twiexpression domains, in cases where the pipe expression domain was expanded ( Morisato, 2001 ) (Figure 3 H). A simple explanation accounts for formation of the two peaks: shuttling is not sufciently effective in concentrating the ligand atthe midline but only to shift it from the edges of the pipe domain. As a result, the ligand is not concentrated toward the ventralmost regions, and signaling is below maximal levels. The Phenotype of Uniform pipe Is Consistent with Self-Organized Shuttling The double peak observed when the pipe domain is extended to 80% of the embryo was lost when pipe was expressed uniformly throughout the embryo ( Sen et al., 1998 ). This is a surprising observation that presents a challenge to self-organized mecha-nisms that rely on the spontaneous breaking of symmetry, suchas those described by a Turing mechanism ( Turing, 1952 ). We asked if self-organized shuttling can account for this observationas well. Indeed, we nd that when uniform cleavage of the Spzprecursor is imposed on the model, no pattern is observed within the typical patterning time. Instead, the inability to concentrate the ligand toward the midline of the embryo predicts a uniform,intermediate level of signaling ( Figures 6 A and 6B; note that this symmetry can be broken, leading to a double-peak solution Cell150, 1016-1028, August 31, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. 1021 COURSE BOOK PAGE 57Figure 5.

(O and P) The expansion of ventro-lateral fates, following uniform expression of pipe in females, is also reflected by the expansion of the WT lateral sogexpression domain (O) to the entire circumference of the embryo (P). These stainings reveal that the embryos laid by cy2:Gal4; UAS-pipe females acquire a ventro-lateral fate corresponding to the Vnd expression domain, throughout the DV axis.See also Table S5 Cell150, 1016-1028, August \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. 1023 COURSE BOOK PAGE 59following a delay that is signicantly longer than the time in which the pattern is generated; data not shown). This prediction of intermediate-level signaling in embryos following uniform expression of pipe during oogenesis is in fact a unique signature of shuttling, which requires the concentration of ligands in order to achieve maximal signaling levels. In con- trast, mechanisms that rely only on the diffusion and degradationof C-Spz, and perhaps its inhibition by a coproduced inhibitor,naturally lead to a uniform, maximal level of activation throughout the embryo, when pipe is uniformly expressed. Thus, our model predicts that uniform expression of pipe will lateralize, rather than ventralize, the embryos. Previous reportsindicated that this is indeed the case. Embryos laid by females that express pipe uniformly in follicle cells lose any mark of polarity along the DV axis. Ventral gastrulation movements appear everywhere, and the larval cuticles show the formation of rings of denticle material, indicating lateralization of theprogeny embryos ( Sen et al., 1998 ). To better dene the precise degree of these fate shifts, we expressed pipe uniformly in follicle cells and followed both the expression of target genes and the nuclear localization of Dlin the embryo (Figures 6 C-6P). The rhomboid (rho),short gastrulation (sog), and ventral nervous system defective (vnd) genes, which are normally expressed in the lateral neuroecto-derm ( Bier et al., 1990 ) or at a restricted domain within the neu- roectoderm ( Chu et al., 1998 ;McDonald et al., 1998 ), respec- tively, are seen throughout the circumference when pipe is uniform. A transgenic Dorsal-GFP (Dl-GFP), which faithfully recapitulates distribution of the Dl protein ( DeLotto et al., 2007 ), shows a nuclear localization throughout the circumfer- ence at intermediate levels matching those of nuclei at the lateral region of wild-type embryos ( Figures 6 G and 6H). Together, these results indicate intermediate levels of Tl path-way activation throughout the embryo, consistent with theshuttling mechanism: despite the uniform activation of Spz re- sulting from ubiquitous pipe expression, maximal levels of Tl activation cannot be obtained in the absence of asymmetries and shuttling. The Flux of N-Spz Dictates Mesoderm Position The essence of the shuttling model is the redistribution of the active ligand by a shuttling molecule (N-Spz in this case), whose effective production domain flanks the morphogenic eld. Uponassociation with the ligand, the shuttling molecule inhibits signaling. However, association provides the driving force for shuttling because the diffusion flux directs the release andconcentration of the ligand in the region furthest from the region in which the shuttling molecule is produced. This distribution allows the shuttling molecule to function as an inhibitor ofsignaling close to the source that produces the shuttling mole-cule and as a facilitator of signaling furthest away from it. To locally produce N-Spz, we capitalized on the fact that binding of NC-Spz to Tl promotes the dissociation betweenN- and et al., 2007 ). A full-length Tl construct tagged C terminally with the Myc antigen was expressed at theanterior end of the embryo using the Hsp83 maternal promoter and the bcd 3 0UTR. Staining for the Myc tag showed a highly restricted anterior localization ( Figures 7 A and S4), consistentwith the limited diffusion capacity of Tl, even prior to cellulariza-tion ( Huang et al., 1997 ). Lateralized embryos display a uniform, intermediate level of Dl protein in all nuclei ( Figure 7 B). Expression of Toll-Myc (Tl-Myc) at the anterior end of such embryos alters the uniform nuclear distribution of Dl, affecting it in three major ways. First, high nuclear Dl levels are sometimes induced in the anterior regionwhere Tl-Myc is expressed ( Figure 7 C). This local effect is likely to result from excess anterior expression of Tl and does not bear on our model. Second, the levels of nuclear Dl are diminished up to about half embryo length from the anterior pole, reflecting theshorter-range nonautonomous effect of releasing high levels of N-Spz, which can sequester and inactivate C-Spz ( Figure 7 D). Finally, the levels of nuclear Dl appear elevated toward the posterior pole, consistent with long-range facilitation of ligand release ( Figure 7 D). To ascertain whether the shift to a nonuniform distribution of nuclear Dl following anterior Tl expression is reflected in the expression patterns of high nuclear Dl target genes, we moni- tored the snamRNA pattern in lateralized embryos. A signicant increase in the proportion of lateralized embryos expressing sna, following anteriorly localized expression of Tl-Myc, was indeedobserved: from /C2481% of lateralized embryos that did not express snaat all ( Figure 7 E) to /C2459% sna-expressing embryos. In particular, 30% of the anterior-Tl-expressing embryos dis-played a prominent posterior snastripe ( Figure 7 G). Only 6% of embryos derived from females expressing pipe uniformly, but not anterior Tl, display this pattern ( Figure 7 F), a feature that can be attributed to rare, spontaneous symmetry breaking, which is in fact predicted by the model. Taken together, thechanges in the patterns of Dl nuclear localization and snagene expression upon anteriorly localized expression of Tl-Myc sug- gest that a flux of N-Spz can generate maximal signaling levels at the position that is furthest from its source. Thus, ectopic expression of Tl at the anterior-most region establishes a signaling gradient along the anterior-posterioraxis. This supports the main prediction of the shuttling mecha-nism: namely, the capacity of N-Spz to act as a nonautonomous short-range inhibitor and long-range activator of signaling. DISCUSSION A Self-Organized Shuttling Mechanism By its nature, diffusion tends to homogenize concentration differ- ences and is, therefore, not ideal for rening a wide expression domain into narrower gradients. Indeed, passive diffusion of amorphogen away from its source is insufcient for producing a sharp gradient within the source itself, as we demonstrated here. Yet, during early development, pattern often has to be es-tablished within a wide domain in which the morphogen isexpressed. We describe a self-organized shuttling mechanism that estab- lishes a robust and sharp gradient of morphogen concentrationwithin a broad domain of morphogen production in the early Drosophila embryo. This mechanism relies only on diffusion but necessitates an additional inhibitor molecule, which binds the morphogen and facilitates its diffusion. We and others have previously characterized the shuttling mechanism in the context 1024 Cell150, 1016-1028, August 31, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. COURSE BOOK PAGE 60of a patterning event taking place later in embryogenesis\u2014the formation of the embryonic BMP activation gradient ( Eldar et al., 2002 ;Matsuda and Shimmi, 2012 ;Meinhardt and Roth, 2002 ;Mizutani et al., 2005 ;Shimmi et al., 2005 ;Wang and Fergu- son, 2005 ). In this context, however, the key asymmetry is provided by a prepattern that allows for asymmetric secretion of the inhibitor Sog, outside the domain being patterned, to drive the process. Such asymmetry, however, is not available to the earlier patterning system, the initial establishment of DV polarity,where the inhibitor is coproduced during morphogen process- ing. Our main nding is that such asymmetry is also established here, through a self-organized mechanism. Versatile Activities of the Spz Prodomain Self-organization is made possible by the remarkable structural and functional versatility of the N- and C-terminal domains ofSpz following its cleavage by the protease Ea, and their capacity to generate an active complex, as well as an inactive complex following reassociation. Spz encodes and cysteine-rich binding to the Tlreceptor. An cleavage site separates between these twodomains. Spz is secreted as a dimer and facilitates the corresponding dimerization of Tl upon binding. However, theN terminus appears to be much more than an inhibitory prodo- main. Upon cleavage by Ea the conformation of Spz is altered such that the C terminus is now exposed to bind Tl, while a non-covalent association with the N terminus is maintained. Binding to Tl releases the N-terminal region of Spz. Our model also requires the dissociation constant between Tl and C-Spz to be relativelyhigh, allowing for release of some of the C-Spz molecules. A central prediction of the model is that N-Spz and C-Spz can reassociate following their initial separation, and we veried thisprediction experimentally. There are biological precedents forreassociation between the active ligand and its prodomain that have important physiological consequences: the BMP family ligands Myostatin and GDF11 are expressed as a proligand.In both cases, cleavage is followed by reassociation of the N-terminal prodomain with the C-terminal dimer, maintaining the ligand in a latent form. Subsequent cleavage of the prodo-main by the Tolloid metalloprotease activates the latent ligand (Ge et al., 2005 ;Wolfman et al., 2003 ). Figure 7. Anterior Tl Overexpression Leads to Short-Range Inhibition and Long-Range Activation of Dl along the AP Axis (A) High levels of anterior Tl expression were obtained by Hsp83 promoter and bcd 30UTR. Tl-Myc is localized to the anterior pole. (B) Embryos laid by females expressing uniform pipe show uniform intermediate levels of nuclear Dl. (C and D) Uniform pipe embryos that overexpress Tl at the anterior pole show short-range inhibition, indicated by low levels of nuclear Dl at the anterior region, and long-range activation, indicated by high levels at the posterior pole. High nuclear Dl at the anterior Tl overexpression domain reflects a cell-autonomous effect. Panels represent different focal planes of the same embryo.(E) Of uniform pipe embryos, 81% does not express the ventral gene sna. (F) Of uniform pipe embryos, 6% expresses snain a weak posterior stripe (n = 115). (G) Of uniform pipe embryos that overexpress Tl at the anterior pole, 59% expresses sna(n = 96), and half of them expresses snain a posterior stripe. Expression ofsnaat the posterior pole indicates long-range activation, consistent with posterior shuttling of C-Spz by the anterior source of N-Spz. Anterior is oriented toward the left, and dorsal is up.See also Figure S4 . Cell150, 1016-1028, August 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. 1025 COURSE BOOK PAGE 61We have further demonstrated that reassociation of the N- and C-terminal domains of Spz produces a distinct form that cannot activate Tl. This diversity of Spz-based molecules thus allows the implementation of a shuttling mechanism during the early phaseof development, despite the limited number of players, because each of the Spz forms plays a different role in the process. Inter- estingly, a distinct role for the N-terminal region of the proteaseGd was recently reported. Following cleavage of this fragment, itbinds the vitelline membrane in the domain dened by expres- sion of pipe, and facilitates the processing of Ea by Snk ( Cho et al., 2012 ). The capacity of N- and C-Spz to reassociate and form an inert complex constitutes the shuttling pair. In analogy to shuttling of Dpp in the dorsal ectoderm, N-Spz fullls an equivalent role toSog. Indeed, we can dictate the polarity of the DV axis in lateral- ized embryos simply by generating a local source for producing higher levels of N-Spz that will lead to a flux, and direct theexpression of mesodermal genes at the opposite pole. In conclusion, by combining computational and experimental analyses of the Spz/Tl pathway, we demonstrate that a sharpand robust patterning gradient can be generated within a uniformregion, through a mechanism we term self-organized shuttling. This mechanism relies on diverse interactions between the ligand and its prodomain, leading to a dynamic and predictable distri-bution of the active ligand. Although the initial shuttling models were restricted to BMP family ligands in several organisms, the current work extends the concept to another signaling pathwayinvolving Spz and Tl. Shuttling mechanisms that generate sharp gradients are essential in the early embryo, where the spatial renement of gene expression is minimal, and the initialpatterning that takes place, prior to the onset of zygotic geneexpression, cannot rely on transcriptional networks. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Fly Strains The following lines were used: UAS-pipeST2 (Sen et al., 1998 ), Dl-GFP (DeLotto et al., 2007 ),UAS-C-Spz-GFP inserted on a chromosome that contains a deciency that covers Tl(Cho et al., 2010 ).UAS-N-Spz contains the Spz signal peptide (aa 1-29), followed by a triple V5 tag, and N-Spz (aa30-147). It was inserted into an AttB UASp plasmid and targeted in flies intothe attP40 site. Hsp83-Tl-Myc-bcd flies were prepared from a construct that was generated by inserting Hsp83 promoter upstream to Tl-Myc (from T. Ip) into a pAttB plasmid. Transgenic lines were inserted into the attP40 site. In Situ Hybridization Probes for ind,sna,dpp,sog, and rhowere prepared using Roche PCR Dig Probe Synthesis Kit. A probe for pipe was prepared using digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA. Fixation, hybridization, and detection were as previously described by Melen et al. (2005) . DNA ConstructsN-Spz was prepared by GeneScript from a sequence of Spz signal peptide(Spz amino acids 1-29) followed by triple N-spz amino acids30-147), Egfr TM domain acids followed by an HAtag. Signal peptide-C-Spz tagged with GFP (Cho et al., 2010 ), and Signal peptide-GFP (Schlesinger et al., 2004 ). Cell CultureHeLa cells were transfected with a DNA construct containing CMV using jutPEI (from Polyplus). ESCORT transfection reagent. Expression of UAS-C-Spz-GFP was achieved by cotransfection with an actin-GAL4 plasmid. Medium of C-Spz-GFP-expressing cells was changed to fresh medium w/o serum after1 day, collected after 2 days, and added to HeLa cells with 0.1% azide.Following 45 min incubation at 37 /C14C, cells were washed three times with PBS and xed at 4% FA. Antibodies used included anti-V5 (mouse, 1:800; In-vitrogen) using 6% sodium hypochlorite, and the vitellinemembrane was removed using methanol (together with Heptan). Embryoswere incubated in Hoyer's solution overnight at 67 /C14C and viewed by dark-eld microscopy. Embryo Immunohistochemistry Embryos were processed and stained as described by Ben-Yaacov et al. (2001) . Primary antibodies and dilutions used in this study include anti-Vnd and anti-Msh (rat, 1:500; a gift 1:100; Bank). Secondary Cy2, Cy3(Jackson ImmunoResearch), or Alexa 488, Alexa 555 (Molecular Probes)conjugated antibodies against the relevant species were used. Cross-sections were generated using a tungsten needle on stained embryos. Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal system. Numerical Screen The following eight of 12 parameters were allowed to vary over several orders of magnitude, resulting in a 12-dimensional parameter space that was assayedstatistically. For each such parameter set, we solved the equations in aregion /C01 < x < 1, with Spz processing occurring at /C00.4 < x < 0.4 domain. Zero flux was assumed in the boundaries. Consistent sets were thosethat result in a monotonous gradient along the DV axis in which signalingin the ventral midline is at least 50% of the maximum, decreases at leastby 40% from the ventral midline to x = 0.2, and by at least 75% to x =0.8. Robustness was assessed by perturbing the production and degrada-tion rates of all components and measuring the positions where fourthresholds were met, resulting in ve expression domains. A set was con-sidered robust and consistent if at least 67% of the perturbed sets didnot display a large change in expression domains, and were also con-sistent.

Fluorescent imaging methods are now being used to visualize these mRNAsin living tissue, allowing dynamic analysis of their behaviorsthroughout the process of localization. This review summarizesrecent findings from such studies that provide new insight intothe elaborate cellular mechanisms that are used to transportmRNAs to different regions of the oocyte and to maintain theirlocalized distributions during oogenesis. Introduction mRNA localization has emerged as an important mechanism forgenerating asymmetric protein distributions that promotemorphological and functional cell polarization during development.A recent in situ hybridization screen uncovered over 1500 transcriptswith distinct subcellular localizations in early Drosophila embryos, hinting at diverse roles for mRNA localization in regulating cellphysiology (L\u00e9cuyer et al., 2007). In contrast to direct proteintargeting, mRNA localization provides an effective way in which tocreate high local protein concentrations, as each transcript can betranslated many times. The coupling of translational activity tomRNA localization prevents premature or ectopic protein synthesisthat might be deleterious to the cell. In addition, an existing pool oflocalized mRNA allows for precise temporal control of local proteinsynthesis in response to external stimuli. The first localized mRNAs were discovered in ascidian eggs over 20 years ago (Jeffery et al., 1983), and localized transcripts havesince been found in many other cell types, including fibroblasts andneurons, as well as in plant cells and fungi (see Box 1). mRNAlocalization is particularly important during early development,when many organisms rely on proteins synthesized from maternalmRNAs to guide development until the onset of zygotictranscription. As these mRNAs are present in the egg at fertilization,when and where their protein products are expressed must beregulated post-transcriptionally. Accordingly, numerous maternalmRNAs have been shown to be asymmetrically localized in oocytesand eggs from a broad spectrum of organisms, includingechinoderms, ascidians, insects, amphibians and fish (Kloc andEtkin, 2005; Palacios and St Johnston, 2001). These mRNAs directthe local synthesis of proteins essential for embryonic germ layerspecification, axis formation and germline determination. Although ascidian and Xenopus eggs provided the first model systems for studying localized transcripts, the Drosophila oocyte has become a major workhorse for both functional and mechanisticanalysis of mRNA localization owing to the availability of powerfulgenetic and transgenic tools. Intensive analysis of four mRNAs,gurken (grk), bicoid (bcd), oskar (osk) and nanos (nos), whose localizations to different regions of the oocyte are essential to specifythe anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) body axes of theDrosophila embryo, has provided insight into the role of mRNA localization in setting up developmental asymmetries, as well as intothe mechanisms that mediate mRNA localization. Localization is a multistep process that requires recognition of cis-acting sequences - localization signals - within mRNAs bylocalization factors, packaging of these RNA-protein complexes(designated hereafter as RNPs) into transport particles, traffickingof these particles within the cytoplasm and, finally, anchoring ofmRNAs at their target destination. RNP assembly may begin in thenucleus, with subsequent remodeling occurring in the cytoplasm torecruit additional factors that confer specificity to the transportprocess. In many cases, mechanisms that maintain translationalsilencing during transport particle formation and transit aresuperimposed. We refer the reader to recent reviews for detailedcoverage of these molecular events (Gavis et al., 2007; Kugler andLasko, 2009; Lewis and Mowry, 2007). Much of the framework for modeling mRNA localization pathways derives from invaluable biochemical, genetic andhistological studies. However, these approaches provide only staticsnapshots of a continuous event. In this review, we discuss how theapplication of powerful new imaging technologies to the analysis ofgrk, bcd, oskand nosmRNAs in Drosophila oocytes has provided a window into the highly dynamic features of mRNA trafficking byvisualizing the movements of RNP particles and the paths that theyfollow. We summarize recent findings that reveal unanticipated complexities in transport and anchoring mechanisms and in theircellular requirements. Role of mRNA localization in the establishment of embryonic body axesAxial polarity of the Drosophila embryo arises from asymmetries set up during oogenesis by a series of mRNA localization events(Fig. 1; see Box 2 for an overview of Drosophila oogenesis). Establishment of both the AP and DV axes depends on signalingfrom the oocyte to subsets Sch\u00fcpbach, 1993). To achieve this, grkmRNA is localized first to the posterior of the oocyte, where Grk signaling tothe overlying follicle cells triggers a reorganization of the oocytecytoskeleton. This enables the subsequent localization of bcd and oskmRNAs to the anterior and posterior poles of the oocyte, respectively, and the dorsal anterior localization of grkitself (Gonz\u00e1lez-Reyes et al., 1995). There, Grk signaling initiates acascade of events that will ultimately generate the embryonic DVaxis. Osk protein, translated upon posterior localization of oskmRNA, initiates the assembly of the germ plasm, a specialized cytoplasm thatis maintained at the posterior pole into embryogenesis and containsdeterminants, including nosmRNA, that are necessary for germline and abdominal development (Lehmann and Nusslein-V olhard, 1986).nosmRNA accumulates at the posterior of the oocyte only at late stages of oogenesis, and this accumulation is dependent on Osk andgerm plasm assembly (Wang et al., 1994). Although nosis translated upon its posterior localization, Nos protein has no known function inDevelopment 136, 2493-2503 (2009) doi:10.1242/dev.032391 Lighting up mRNA localization oogenesis Agata N.

Similarly, Bcd, whose synthesis is repressed during oogenesis, functions only after fertilization (Drieverand N\u00fcsslein-V olhard, 1988). Localization of these mRNAs duringoogenesis, however, endows the newly fertilized embryo with sourcesfor the production of opposing protein gradients that establish the APbody axis. Bcd, acting both as a transcriptional activator and atranslational repressor, the head Nos, a translational repressor, determines the abdomen(reviewed by Thompson et al., 2007). In addition, localized nos mRNA is incorporated into the germ cells as they form at the posteriorof the embryo, supplying the Nos protein that is necessary forgermline development (Gavis et al., 2008). Genetic manipulations that disrupt localization or cause the mislocalization of grk, bcd, oskor nosduring oogenesis the specific subcellular distributions ofthese mRNAs are essential for their function in axial and germlinedevelopment. For example, mutations that abolish oskor nos localization produce embryos that lack an abdomen (Ephrussi et al.,1991; Wang et al., 1994). These embryos also exhibit the respectivedefects in germ cell formation and function that are characteristic ofoskand nosmutants (Ephrussi and Lehmann, 1991; Gavis et al., 2008). Conversely, the targeting of osk or nosto both poles of theoocyte results in embryos in which the anterior structures arereplaced by mirror image duplications of posterior structures(Ephrussi and Gavis DV polarity defects (Neuman-Silberberg and Sch\u00fcpbach, 1993). The ability to test thesignificance of mRNA localization to developmental gene functionhas been a major contribution of the Drosophila system. Live fluorescent visualization methodsIn situ hybridization experiments have elucidated mRNAlocalization patterns and, combined with genetic, cell biologicaland biochemical manipulations, have been used to demonstratethat the mRNA localization process requires cis-acting signals,trans-acting factors, and cytoskeletal components. However, insitu hybridization can only detect the steady state accumulationof mRNAs. Thus, to understand how mRNAs travel to theirdestinations and to investigate the roles played by localizationfactors and cytoskeletal elements in executing this process, weneed to be able to visualize mRNA localization as it occurs in realtime. A further challenge in the analysis of Drosophila oocyte mRNAs arises from the increasing impenetrability of oocytes tomolecular probes as the vitelline membrane and egg shell are laidREVIEW Development 136 (15) Box 1. Key examples of localized mRNAs In budding yeast, localization of ASH1 mRNA to the bud tip by myosin-mediated transport on actin cables (see A in figure) targets Ash1p to the daughter cell, where it is required to repress mating type switching (reviewed by Gonsalvez et al., 2005). Thus, mating type switching occurs only in the mother cell, thereby ensuring that both yeast mating types are present in the population. Germ layer specification in Xenopus embryos relies on localized mRNAs, including Vg1and VegT (reviewed by King et al., 2005) (see B in figure), which are transported to the vegetal pole of the oocyte by kinesin motors and anchored to the cortex by an actin-dependent mechanism. After fertilization, Vg1and VegT RNAs are inherited by embryonic vegetal Vg1 protein, a TGF homolog, participates in mesoderm specification, while VegT, a transcription factor, regulates endoderm specification and mesoderm induction. mRNA localization plays an important role in the polarization of somatic cells, such asfibroblasts and neurons (see C,D in figure). Localization of -actin mRNA to the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts provides a high local concentration of actin monomers that drives assembly of the actin filaments needed for forward movement. Similarly, -actin mRNA localization to growth cones in developing axons promotes the motility required for axon guidance (reviewed by Condeelis and Singer, 2005). Dendritic localization RNAs kinase II (CaMKII ) mRNA in hippocampal neurons facilitates a rapid response to synaptic activity in the form of local protein translation and contributes to learning and memory-related synaptic plasticity (reviewed by Martinet al., 2000). B Xenopus BOOK PAGE 662495 REVIEW Development 136 (15) down. The difficulty of detecting localization patterns at later stages of oogenesis by in situ hybridization left events that occurduring this sizeable temporal window largely unexplored. Thedevelopment of live-imaging methods using fluorescently taggedRNAs and proteins has recently overcome these limitations to theanalysis of mRNA localization dynamics. At lower resolution,time-lapse imaging has provided integrated spatiotemporalinformation about RNA distributions during the course ofoogenesis. Imaging at higher spatial and temporal resolution haspermitted detailed characterization of the kinetics and paths ofindividual RNA particles. The application of techniques likefluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) andfluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) has further facilitateda dynamic analysis of localization events. These methods assessthe mobility of fluorescent molecules, by monitoring either therestoration of fluorescence to a photobleached area of a cellcaused by the movement of fluorescently labeled molecules fromsurrounding unbleached regions (FRAP) or the depletion offluorescently labeled molecules from an unbleached region afterrepetitive photobleaching of an adjacent area (FLIP). Visualization of RNA localization in living cells was first accomplished in oligodendrocytes by injection of in vitro transcribed myelin basic protein RNA labeled with fluorescein(Aigner et al., 1993). Similarly, injection of fluorescently labeledtranscripts has been a successful strategy for investigating thelocalization of grkand bcdRNAs in Drosophila oocytes, with the relatively large size of the egg chamber making it possible toperform injections into both the nurse cells and oocyte (Cha et al.,2001; Clark et al., 2007; Delanoue et al., 2007; MacDougall et al.,2003; Mische et al., 2007) (Fig. 2A). The ability to control the siteand time at which the fluorescent RNA is introduced enables theinvestigator to perform pulse-chase type experiments, making thismethod particularly advantageous for the dissection of multi-stepRNA localization pathways. Although caution must be taken todiscern artifacts that result from damage to the egg chamberduring injection, a more difficult issue to address is whether thebehavior of RNA injected directly into the cytoplasm recapitulatesthe behavior of native mRNA that has first been processed in thenucleus. Additionally, the benefit of being able to introduce largequantities of RNA that facilitate detection must be weighedagainst the possibility that the introduction of nonphysiologicalamounts of exogenous RNA could result in its aggregation orcould saturate the localization machinery. The recent development of genetically encoded fluorescent tagging methods has enabled the direct visualization of endogenoustranscripts (Fig. 2B). Pioneered in yeast for ASH1 mRNA (Bertrand et al., 1998), this approach involves tethering a fluorescent protein,such as green or red fluorescent protein (GFP or RFP) to mRNA.This is usually accomplished by fusing GFP (or another fluorescentprotein) to the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein (MCP) and, inparallel, inserting multiple stem-loop binding sites for the coatprotein into the transcript of interest (Fig. 2B). When the MCP-GFPfusion protein and MS2-tagged RNA are co-expressed, stem-loops generates fluorescentlytagged mRNA vivo. The system was adapted for transgenic usein Drosophila to investigate nosmRNA localization in late oocytes (Forrest and Gavis, 2003), and has been subsequently applied to grk,bcd and osk(Jaramillo et al., 2008; Weil et al., 2006; Zimyanin et al., 2008) (Fig. 1C-F), as well as al., 2008). A majorstrength of this system is the production of fluorescent transcripts,at or near physiological levels, that have been subject to endogenousprocessing steps. The method has been particularly advantageous inthe Drosophila ovary, where localization pathways are often active over many hours and at developmental stages that are not readilypenetrated by other detection methods. Moreover, the analysis ofsteady-state localization afforded by this method provides acomplement to the investigation of transient events following RNA P AFollicle cell Oocyte Nurse cellAD V Fig. 1.

DEVELOPMENT COURSE BOOK PAGE 672496 injection and has been essential for the dissection of anchoring mechanisms. Of potential concern with this approach, however, isthe possibility that the inserted MS2 stem-loops will destabilize atranscript or impair its ability to interact with localization factors.Moreover, binding of the transcript by multiple copies of MCP-GFPcould compromise transport particle assembly or function.Comparison of RNA distributions achieved using this method withthose detected by in situ hybridization, together with genetic rescueexperiments, is therefore essential to confirm that the taggedtranscripts faithfully reproduce the behavior of the native mRNA. In an alternative approach to the direct detection of mRNA in vivo, GFP-tagged localization factors have been used as proxies fortheir target mRNAs (Fig. 2C). Because it relies on the identificationof appropriate factors and a prior knowledge of coordinated mRNA-protein transport, this method is less widely applicable. In addition,a single localization factor might provide only a partial readout ofan mRNA's travels if its association with the RNP is limited toparticular steps in the localization pathway. Moreover, as individuallocalization factors are increasingly implicated in the transport ofmultiple different mRNAs, sometimes to different locations,discriminating which of the fluorescent RNPs contain the mRNA ofinterest could be difficult. Nonetheless, the need for only a singletransgene and the ease of detecting the tagged protein have madetwo such protein fusions, GFP-Exu and GFP-Stau, choice tools for (Exu) and Staufen (Stau)function in bcd and osk mRNA localization, together with colocalization studies, have implicated Exu and Stau as componentsof bcdand oskRNPs (reviewed by Kugler and Lasko, 2009; St Johnston, 2005). However, whether Exu is specific for bcdor can also contribute to oskRNPs is not yet clear. Because Stau functions in osk localization during midoogenesis and in bcdlocalization only at late stages of oogenesis, GFP-Stau can serve as an independentproxy for each mRNA in the oocyte. RNA localization dynamics in Drosophila oogenesis Recent analyses of RNA localization dynamics during Drosophila oogenesis, made possible by new imaging technologies, have led torevised models for the localization of four key mRNAs. Below, wediscuss findings from these studies that have provided new insightsinto the mechanisms that mediate the transport of these mRNAs fromthe ovarian nurse cells into the oocyte, their localization within theoocyte, and their anchoring at targeted regions of the oocyte cortex. Transport from nurse cells to oocyte Maternal mRNAs, proteins and even organelles produced in theovarian nurse cells must be transferred into the oocyte for theproduction of the egg and early embryo.

Transcription of this construct by T7 polymerase in the presence of afluorophore-coupled nucleotide produces fluorescently labeled RNA forinjection into cultured egg chambers. RNA can be injected directly intothe oocyte as illustrated or into the nurse cells. ( B) In vivo labeling of endogenous mRNA by the MS2 system. This strategy requires twocomponents: a transgene (transgene 1) that encodes the target RNAwith an insertion of tandem copies of the stem-loop binding site for thebacteriophage MS2 coat protein (MCP), shown here in the 3 /H11032UTR, usually under the control of its own promoter (P x); and a transgene (transgene 2) that encodes a fluorescent protein fused to MCP (GFP isshown here) under the control of a maternally active promoter (P mat). Transgenic fly lines for each component are crossed together togenerate females that express both the tagged RNA and the MCP-GFPprotein in their ovarian nurse cells. When the two transgenes are thuscoexpressed, the binding of MCP to its recognition motif labels theRNA with GFP .

DEVELOPMENT COURSE BOOK PAGE 682497 REVIEW Development 136 (15) when the nurse cells contract and extrude or 'dump' their contents into the oocyte, the transport of cargoes from the nurse cells to theoocyte is continuous and selective. This intercellular transportoccurs via the ring canals that connect the nurse cells to the oocyteand to each other (Box 2). During the first half of oogenesis,microtubules that extend from a microtubule-organizing center(MTOC) at the posterior of the oocyte through the ring canals intothe nurse cells could provide a direct route to the oocyte (Theurkaufet al., 1992). However, this microtubule 'highway' isdecommissioned at when Grk-dependent overlying follicle cells trigger of Live-imaging bcdand grk, using injected GFP-Exu as a localizationfactor proxy for bcd mRNA, have shed light on the mechanism of nurse cell-to-oocyte transport at mid-stages of oogenesis, as well ason its cytoskeletal basis (Cha et al., 2001; Clark et al., 2007; Mischeet al., 2007; Theurkauf and Hazelrigg, 1998). In the nurse cells, injected bcdand grktranscripts and GFP-Exu each form particles that move rapidly and on linear tracks toward ringcanals at the nurse cell-oocyte boundary, where they accumulate (Chaet al., 2001; Clark et al., 2007; Mische et al., 2007; Theurkauf andHazelrigg, 1998) (see Movie in the supplementary material; Fig.3A). During stages 8-9, microtubules appear to be concentrated atthese ring canals in arrays that project into the nurse cell cytoplasm,suggesting a possible path for mRNA transport. Indeed, treatment ofoocytes with microtubule-depolymerizing drugs prevents thedirectional movement of GFP-Exu, and of bcdand grkRNA. To test whether the observed motility reflects active transport, Mische et al.and Clark et al. compromised dynein function genetically (Mische etal., 2007; Clark et al., 2007). The resulting decrease in motility of bothGFP-Exu and grk RNA particles in nurse cells indicates that oocyte- destined mRNAs share a common dynein-dependent transportpathway for translocation to the ring canals. How RNA particlesencounter the ring canal-associated microtubules is not yet clear. Inaddition to directed movement, GFP-Exu particles exhibit randomlyoriented microtubule-dependent movement throughout the et al., 2007; Theurkauf and Hazelrigg, 1998).These particles could therefore encounter ring canal-associatedmicrotubules through a microtubule-dependent random walk. Bycontrast, particles of injected grkRNA distant from the ring canals appear to follow cytoplasmic flows (Clark et al., 2007). Randommovements caused by these flows might facilitate chance encounterswith ring canal-associated microtubules. GFP-Exu and grk particles that accumulate at the ring canal subsequently pass through into the oocyte. Movement through thering canals is slower than movement towards them, however,suggesting that transport to and through the ring canals may occurby two distinct mechanisms. Intriguingly, the size and shape ofGFP-Exu particles change as they enter the oocyte (Mische et al.,2007). This might reflect a remodeling of the RNP to exchangelocalization factors required in the nurse cells for oocyte-specificfactors or to sort co-transported mRNAs that are destined fordifferent locations within the oocyte. The formation of a bcd-Exu RNP in the nurse cells is not required for transport of injected bcd RNA to the oocyte, but is essential for the anterior localization ofbcdin the oocyte (see below) (Cha et al., 2001). Thus, it is an intriguing possibility that Exu coordinates a remodeling event thattriggers the recognition of bcd-containing particles by the oocytetransport machinery. Box 2. Drosophila oogenesis The Drosophila ovary is composed of 14-16 ovarioles, each of which contains a series of developing egg chambers (reviewed by Spradling, 1993) (see figure). Each egg chamber is composed of an oocyte and its 15 sister nurse cells, which comprise a 16-cell cyst, surrounded by a somatic follicular epithelium. The germ cell cyst arises from a stem cell-derived cystoblast that undergoes four synchronous divisions. Incomplete cytokinesisduring these divisions leaves the 16 cells interconnected by actin-rich cytoplasmic bridges referred to as ring canals. One of these cells differentiatesas the oocyte and enters meiosis, while the remainder become polyploid nurse cells. The egg chamber develops through 14 morphologically distinct stages to give rise to a mature oocyte. Throughout oogenesis, the nurse cells produce maternal RNAs, proteins and organelles that are delivered to the developing oocyte via the ring canals. This supply of maternal factors bythe nurse cells is critical to development of the oocyte and the future embryo as the oocyte nucleus is largely transcriptionally quiescent. At the endof stage 10, when the nurse cell cluster and the oocyte are similar in volume, the nurse cells contract to extrude or 'dump' their contents into theoocyte and are subsequently eliminated by apoptosis (see inset in figure). Vigorous streaming of the oocyte cytoplasm (ooplasmic streaming), whichaccompanies nurse cell dumping, mixes the incoming nurse cell cytoplasm with the ooplasm (see Movie 1 in the supplementary material). The folliclecells, which migrate to enclose the oocyte, secrete both the vitelline membrane and the chorion or egg shell to protect the maturing egg. Stage 8 Stage 9 Stage 10Stage 12Stage 6 Mature egg Nurse cellOocyteFollicle cell Egg shell DEVELOPMENT COURSE BOOK PAGE 692498 Transport during mid-oogenesis After entering the oocyte, mRNAs must be translocated to specific cortical regions. Because RNPs enter the oocyte at itsanterior end, anterior localization could occur simply by thembeing 'captured' through interactions with cytoskeletal ormembrane proteins at the anterior cortex. By contrast, posteriorlocalization requires that RNPs traverse distances of 50 m or more. The anterior localization of bcd and the posterior localization of oskmRNA are both disrupted by the treatment of egg chambers with microtubule-depolymerizing drugs (Pokrywkaand Stephenson, 1991; Pokrywka and Stephenson, 1995). Theseearly experiments, which were performed using in situhybridization to detect end-stage localization, could notdistinguish whether microtubules act directly or indirectly.Nonetheless, they suggested that the oocyte possessesmicrotubule-based machinery for the the oocyte microtubule cytoskeleton results in an apparent AP gradient of microtubules(Theurkauf et al., 1992). A longstanding model proposed that thesemicrotubules are polarized along the AP axis, with minus endsnucleated at the anterior cortex and plus ends projected towards theposterior. Accordingly, whether an RNP particle is transported to theanterior or posterior pole would depend on whether it associates withdynein or kinesin motor proteins. This model is based on a numberof observations. First, partial microtubule depolymerization leavesshort microtubules Because microtubules depolymerize from the plus result suggests that microtubules are nucleated at the anteriorcortex. Furthermore, a fusion between the motor domain of kinesinand -galactosidase (kinesin- -gal) that localizes to the plus ends of microtubules in neurons (Giniger et al., 1993) accumulates at theposterior of mid-stage oocytes (Clark et al., 1994). Consistent withthe proposed polarity of the microtubule cytoskeleton, geneticstudies subsequently implicated the plus-end-directed motor kinesinI in the localization of oskmRNA to the posterior pole (Brendza et al., 2000) and the minus-end-directed motor dynein in thelocalization of bcd mRNA to the anterior (Duncan and Warrior, 2002; Januschke et al., 2002). This simple model was first called into question by the live- imaging studies of Cha et al. (Cha et al., 2001), who compared thebehavior of fluorescent bcd RNA transported to the oocyte following its injection into nurse cells with the behavior of bcdRNA injected directly into the oocyte. Whereas bcdtranscripts injected into the nurse cells accumulate specifically at the anterior oocyte cortex,those injected directly into the oocyte accumulate at the nearestcortex and this nonpolarized transport depends on Exu andmicrotubules. Subsequent work by Mische et al. (Mische et al.,2007) showed that the nonpolarized cortical transport of bcdRNA injected into the oocyte is mediated by dynein. The ability of theinjected RNA to be transported by dynein to any part of the cortexsuggests that microtubule minus ends are not restricted to theanterior cortex and that microtubule organization alone is notsufficient to dictate asymmetric RNA localization. Further supportfor this conclusion comes from high-resolution imaging of bcdRNP particles formed after injection of bcdRNA directly into the oocyte. These particles move with linear trajectories but in randomdirections near the oocyte anterior (Mische et al., 2007). How then is bcd directed to the anterior cortex? Fluorescent bcd RNA does accumulate selectively at the anterior cortex if it isinjected first into nurse cells, then withdrawn and injected into ana\u00efve oocyte (Cha et al., 2001). By contrast, localization occurs ina nonpolar manner if bcdis injected first into nurse cells from exu mutant egg chambers. This result places a prior requirement for Exuin the nurse cells for the subsequent localization of bcd mRNA in the oocyte. Thus, although Exu present in the oocyte is sufficientfor the nonpolar localization of injected bcd RNA, the Exu- dependent assembly of bcdRNPs in the nurse cells is crucial for targeting to the anterior cortex. Components of this RNP mightpromote dynein-mediated transport on a select subpopulation ofmicrotubules anterior cortex or might preventtransport microtubules nucleated at the lateral cortex (Cha et al.,2002) (Fig. 3B). Distinguishing which, if either, of these scenariosis correct will be facilitated by the analysis of genetically encodedfluorescent bcdmRNA. Intriguingly, a recent analysis of oocytes suggests that may use a distinct subpopulation of microtubules that has the plus ends oriented towards the vegetal cortex (Messitt et al.,2008).REVIEW Development 136 plasmAP Nanos Fig. 3.

DEVELOPMENT COURSE BOOK PAGE 702499 REVIEW Development 136 (15) A different way to achieve net polarized transport during mid- oogenesis has come to light from a dynamic analysis of osk localization (Zimyanin et al., 2008). This study tracked the movement of oskRNP particles during midstages of oogenesis by using either the MS2 system to label osk mRNA directly with GFP or by using GFP- Stau as a proxy for osk transport particles. Live imaging revealed rapid, directed movements of both GFP-Stau and oskRNP particles throughout the oocyte, consistent with kinesin-dependent transport(see Movie 3 in the supplementary material). Surprisingly, however,oskparticles move with similar average velocities in all directions, showing only a slight posterior bias. As the velocity of all rapidlymoving oskparticles, regardless of their direction and position in the oocyte, is decreased in kinesin I mutants with reduced motor speedbut not in dynein mutants, it is unlikely that differential transport byopposing motor proteins leads to the observed bias. Rather, Zimyaninet al. (Zimyanin et al., 2008) proposed that kinesin transports osk on randomly oriented microtubules, but that a slight polarization inoocyte microtubule organization leads to a small excess of posteriorlydirected transport events (Fig. 3B). Over the relatively long period thatoskis being localized (6-10 hours), this weak bias could suffice to greatly enrich oskmRNA at the posterior of the oocyte. Importantly, the interpretation of microtubule orientation based on the behavior ofoskRNPs fits the existing data. Assuming a slight posterior bias of microtubule plus ends, plus-end markers, such as kinesin- -gal, would be expected to accumulate at the oocyte posterior by a biasedrandom walk, similarly to osk. In addition, the observed accumulation of injected bcdRNA at the nearest cortex (Cha et al., 2002) and the dynein-dependent movement of bcd RNA particles in multiple directions (Mische et al., 2007) is consistent with a largely randomdistribution of minus ends. Intriguingly, the posterior bias in oskmovement is reversed in mutants for several experiments have shown that thesemutants accumulate oskmRNA at the anterior of the oocyte, instead of at the posterior as in wild-type et al., 1995;Newmark 1994; van Eeden et al., 2001). A plausibleexplanation is that these factors are required to uncouple osk RNP particles from the dynein motors that mediate nurse cell-to-oocytetransport so that they can associate with kinesin in the oocyte,although aberrant microtubule organization could be a contributingfactor in mago mutant egg chambers (Micklem et al., 1997). During mid-oogenesis, grkmRNA displays a spatiotemporally dynamic distribution that first became evident from in situhybridization experiments. In early oocytes, grkaccumulates at the posterior pole; oocyte cortex, thenbecomes restricted to the dorsal anterior region during stages 8-9(see Fig. 1) (Neuman-Silberberg and Sch\u00fcpbach, 1993). Todistinguish whether these distributions arise by distinct localizationmechanisms or whether they are interdependent, MacDougall et al.(MacDougall et al., 2003) tracked individual RNP particles formedafter the injection of fluorescent grkRNA into oocytes. By varying the site of injection and the time at which particles were imaged afterinjection, they showed that grkparticles follow two distinct paths in sequence, the first directed toward the anterior cortex and the seconddirected dorsally along the anterior cortex (Fig. 3B). Both steps canbe inhibited by microtubule depolymerization and injection of anti-dynein heavy chain (dhc) antibodies that block dynein function(MacDougall et al., 2003). Further evidence for dynein-dependenttransport of grkRNA on microtubules is provided by high-resolution that in situ hybridization andimmunoelectron microscopy This method detectsclusters of injected grktranscripts assembled in nonmembranous electron dense structures that probably represent transport particles(Delanoue et al., 2007). Most of these particles reside within 100 nmof the nearest microtubule and colocalize with dynein, consistentwith grktransport particles in transit. Whether grkand bcdtranscripts are transported to the anterior cortex on the same set of microtubules is not known. However, thecomplex trajectory followed by grkRNP particles indicates that, unlike bcd, they must be able to recognize two different microtubule subpopulations. Several studies have reported evidence for anetwork of microtubules associated with the dorsally located oocytenucleus that might mediate transport of grkfrom the anterior cortex to its dorsal anterior position (Januschke et al., 2006; MacDougallet al., 2003). Presumably, components specific to grkor bcdRNPs regulate the choice of microtubules by their associated dyneinmotors, possibly by recognizing chemical modifications ormicrotubule-associated proteins (MAPS) that are present ondifferent subsets of microtubules. The grkmRNA localization factor Squid (Sqd) is a candidate for such a specificity factor. In situhybridization to grkmRNA first showed that grkaccumulates at the oocyte anterior but does not shift anterodorsally in sqdmutants (Neuman-Silberberg and Sch\u00fcpbach, 1993). Subsequently,MacDougall et al. (MacDougall et al., 2003) found reduced dorsalanteriorly directed movement and increased ventrally directedmovement of injected grkparticles in sqdmutant egg chambers. This effect on the directionality of grkRNP particles implicates Sqd in selective microtubule utilization. Localization during stages of oogenesis The fluorescent tagging of endogenous mRNA using the MS2system has been instrumental in the investigation of mRNAlocalization during late stages of oogenesis, when molecular probeshave limited access to the egg because of the presence of the vitellinemembrane and the egg shell. The use of genetically encodedfluorescent nosand bcd mRNAs led to the discovery of two mechanistically distinct, late-acting localization pathways thatoperate simultaneously at late stages of oogenesis to position theseRNAs at opposite poles of the oocyte (Forrest and Gavis, 2003; Weilet al., 2006; Weil et al., 2008). nosrepresents mRNAs, including cyclin B , germ cell-less andpolar granule component, that is deposited in the oocyte by nurse cell dumping and localizes to the posterior in oogenesis (Dalbyand 1994). Time-lapse imaging of endogenous fluorescent nos mRNA showed a steady accumulation of nosat the posterior pole of the oocyte following the onset of nurse cell dumping (Forrest andGavis, 2003). At the posterior, nos colocalizes with the germ plasm component Vasa (Vas) in large particles, consistent with the knowngenetic requirement for germ plasm in noslocalization. In contrast to the localization of grk, bcdand oskmRNA during mid-oogenesis, the posterior localization of nosis reduced but not abolished by complete depolymerization of the microtubule cytoskeleton, providing evidenceagainst microtubule-dependent transport. The reduction in nos localization, however, points to the role of another microtubule-dependent process called ooplasmic streaming. Immediately prior tonurse cell dumping, oocyte microtubules reorganize cytoplasm that mixes theincoming contents of nurse cells with the ooplasm (Gutzeit 1982; Palacios and St Johnston, 2002; (seeMovie 1 in the supplementary material). Because microtubule DEVELOPMENT COURSE BOOK PAGE 712500 depolymerization blocks ooplasmic streaming but not nurse cell dumping, the effect on noslocalization supports a model whereby nos RNPs diffuse throughout the oocyte but become trapped at theposterior by association with the germ plasm (Fig. 3C). Ooplasmicstreaming thus enhances localization by facilitating encountersbetween nosRNPs and the germ plasm (Forrest and Gavis, 2003). Supporting this model, high-resolution imaging of fluorescent nos mRNA has subsequently detected individual nosmRNA particles moving in concert with yolk granules during ooplasmic streaming,consistent with passive transport (Weil et al., 2008) (see Movie 4 inthe supplementary material). Time-lapse imaging of genetically encoded fluorescent bcdmRNA during the transition from mid to late stages of oogenesis showed thatbcdcontinues to accumulate at the anterior during nurse cell dumping. This late localization actually accounts for the majority of bcdmRNA that is present at the anterior of the embryo (Weil et al., 2006).Differing genetic requirements suggest that the initial and late phasesof bcdlocalization use mechanistically distinct pathways. Mutations in stau and swallow (swa) selectively disrupt the late phase of bcd localization, and particles containing both bcdmRNA and Stau are detected only at these stages (St Johnston et al., 1989; Weil et al., 2006;Weil et al., 2008). Although exuis essential for bcd localization during both mid and late oogenesis, Exu phosphorylation is selectivelyrequired during the initial period (Riechmann and Ephrussi, 2004).Differences in bcdRNP assembly and composition might adapt bcd to the cellular machinery operating at different stages. In contrast to nos, transport of bcd mRNA is both microtubule and dynein dependent. Live imaging of the microtubule marker Tau-GFPrevealed a subpopulation of microtubules that project from the anteriorcortex, distinct from the cortical microtubules that drive ooplasmicstreaming (Fig. Tau-GFP together with fluorescent bcd mRNA, Weil et al. (Weil et al., 2008) demonstrated directly that bcdRNP particles travel on these microtubule tracks (see Movie 5 in the supplementary material). Theanterior microtubules are probably nucleated by a MTOC formed atthe anterior cortex at the onset of nurse cell dumping (Schnorrer et al.,2002), suggesting that a specific reorganization of microtubules at theanterior cortex is responsible for maintaining an anterior transportpathway, while the majority of microtubules are reorganized forooplasmic streaming. Surprisingly, Weil et al. (Weil et al., 2006) foundthat localization of bcdmRNA during nurse cell dumping can also be disrupted by actin depolymerization. This actin dependence proved tobe indirect, however, because of a role for cortical actin in anchoringthe anterior microtubules (Fig. 4A). The finding that maximal bcdmRNA accumulation occurs after nurse cell dumping suggests that other mRNAs localized duringmid-oogenesis could continue to be localized at late stages.Although endogenous osk mRNA has not yet been examined, injected osktranscripts accumulate at the posterior of late oocytes, facilitated by ooplasmic streaming (Glotzer et al., 1997). Thus,molecular asymmetries established through the polarized transportof mRNAs during mid-oogenesis might be maintained andreinforced by the subsequent localization of additional transcriptsprovided to the oocyte during nurse cell dumping. Anchoring of mRNAs at the oocyte cortex The effectiveness of a localization pathway depends on the ability tomaintain transcripts at the target destination. The term 'anchoring' iscommonly used to describe this end point of localization, implying astable association of mRNA with a component of the cellulararchitecture. For mRNAs like oskand nos, anchoring is requisite Lehmann, 1994; Markussen et al., 1995; Rongoet al., 1995). Transport and anchoring phases of localization pathwayshave been difficult to separate by traditional static imaging methodsthat visualize cumulative events. By permitting the investigation ofthe steady-state behavior of RNAs at the oocyte cortex, live-imagingmethods have revealed an unexpected diversity of mechanisms formaintaining transcript localization. Live imaging of both GFP-tagged nosmRNA and Vas-GFP has provided evidence for the retention of posteriorly localized mRNAsvia actin-dependent anchoring of the depolymerize actinfilaments, nosmRNA and Vas-GFP that have previously accumulated at the posterior cortex are released coincidently and swept away by theforce of ooplasmic streaming (Forrest and Gavis, 2003). Thedependence of noslocalization on the germ plasm and the coincident release of nos and Vas suggests that nos mRNA is anchored to the cortical actin cytoskeleton via its association with the germ plasm.FRAP experiments, in which RFP-tagged nosRNA at the posterior cortex of a late (stage 13) oocyte was irreversibly photobleached,showed no fluorescence recovery by exchange with unbleached RFP-tagged nosmRNA from the nearby cytoplasm, confirming that this cortical association is highly stable (Weil et al., 2006). An actin-dependent posterior anchoring system could be established through a feedback loop that initiates with oskmRNA localization itself. Upon localization to the posterior anchoring Key Fig. 4.

DEVELOPMENT COURSE BOOK PAGE 722501 REVIEW Development 136 (15) oogenesis, oskmRNA is translated to produce two protein isoforms, Long Osk and Short Osk (Markussen et al., 1995; Rongo et al., 1995). Long Osk is required in turn to maintain osk mRNA and Short Osk localization at the posterior, whereas Short Osk recruits Vas and othergerm plasm components (Breitwieser et al., 1996; Vanzo andEphrussi, 2002). Both isoforms appear to be involved in theorganization of long F-actin projections at the posterior cortex (Vanzoet al., 2007). Whether this actin organization is required for theposterior anchoring of oskis not known, but a role for actin is consistent with the partial release of oskmRNA from the posterior cortex observed after the treatment of egg chambers with actin-depolymerizing drugs (Cha et al., 2002). An interplay between actin,oskmRNA, germ plasm, and nos mRNA anchoring is further supported by the ability of mutations in the cortical actin bindingprotein Moesin to cause the delocalization oskmRNA, Vas protein and nosmRNA, along with detachment of from the posterior cortex (Jankovics et al., 2002; Polesello al., 2002). In contrast to posteriorly localized mRNAs, bcdmRNA retention at the anterior of the oocyte requires microtubules. By performingin situ hybridization on paraffin sections, Pokrykwa and Stephenson(Pokrykwa and Stephenson, 1991) found that treatment of stage 10egg chambers with microtubule-depolymerizing drugs disrupts bcd localization. A role for microtubules in maintaining anterior bcd mRNA localization during stages 10-12 was confirmed by live-imaging experiments, which showed that bcdRNP particles detach from the anterior cortex upon treatment of cultured oocytes withmicrotubule-depolymerizing drugs (Weil et al., 2006). Surprisingly,however, microtubules do not serve to anchor bcdto the anterior cortex. Rather, FRAP and FLIP analysis revealed that the associationof bcdmRNA with the anterior cortex is dynamic, even after nurse cell dumping and ooplasmic streaming are complete and bcd accumulation appears maximal. High-resolution imaging during thistime period showed dynein-dependent translocation of bcdparticles, with the majority directed towards or along the anterior cortex (Weilet al., 2006; Weil et al., 2008) (see Movie 4 in the supplementarymaterial). Together, these results indicate that bcdmRNA does not become stably anchored during these stages and that steady-statelocalization requires continual active transport (Fig. 4A). The ability to monitor the behavior of bcd particles as oogenesis progresses towards fertilization has uncoveredadditional temporal complexity in the bcdmRNA localization pathway. Such a temporal analysis of bcd mRNA particle dynamics revealed that bcdmRNA shifts from continuous active transport to stable actin-dependent anchoring at the end ofoogenesis, with bcd RNPs foci in association with the cortical actin cytoskeleton (Weil et al., 2008) (Fig. 4A).Furthermore, through a combination of in vitro manipulations andmutational analysis, Weil et al. (Weil et al., 2008) showed thatcalcium signaling events that occur prior to fertilization triggerthe dissipation of these foci throughout the anterior of the egg,probably through an effect on the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 4A).Intriguingly, a similar mechanism appears to release Vg1 mRNA from its actin tether during fertilization (Yisraeli et al.,1990). Although it is unclear why a stable anchoring system is notestablished until late in oogenesis, the transition to actin-dependent anchoring could ensure the integrity of bcdmRNA localization, like that of nos, during periods when eggs are held dormant in the female prior to fertilization. Like bcd, grk mRNA also undergoes a shift from dynamic maintenance to stable cortical association, but in this case thetransition coincides with the shift from anterior to dorsal anterior grklocalization. FRAP experiments performed on both injected andendogenous fluorescent grk RNA showed fluorescence recovery of grkat the anterior cortex of the oocyte, but not at its dorsal anterior position (Delanoue et al., 2007; Jaramillo et al., 2008). Thus, grk mRNA is statically anchored only after it becomes dorsally restrictedand not during its transient localization at the anterior cortex.Surprisingly, however, dorsal anterior anchoring of grk is compromised by the injection of antibodies to dhc (Delanoue et al.,2007). To further investigate this dynein-dependent anchoringmechanism, Delanoue et al. (Delanoue et al., 2007) turned to ISH-EM. By this method, injected and endogenous grktranscripts are detected, together with dynein heavy chain and Sqd, at the dorsalanterior region in large cytoplasmic structures that resemblepreviously described sponge bodies (Fig. 4C). Hypomorphicmutations in dhcdisrupt these sponge bodies and cause the dispersal of grkRNA. Dynein therefore plays two biochemically distinct roles in grklocalization: first as a motor for transport and then as an anchor via an as yet unknown function in sponge body integrity.Sponge bodies form in sqd mutants, but when grkRNA is injected into the mutant oocytes, it fails to enter the sponge bodies andremains in transport particles (Delanoue et al., 2007). Inhibition ofSqd function by antibodies causes the detachment of anchored grk RNA; ultrastructural analysis showed that grkresides in transport particles rather than in sponge bodies when Sqd is inhibited. Thisaccumulation of transport particles outside of the sponge bodiessuggests an additional role for Sqd in the remodeling of transportparticles to anchoring complexes following their transport to thedorsal anterior corner. Conclusions The ability to visualize mRNA localization events in real time andto monitor the behavior of RNA particles at high temporal andspatial resolution has advanced and expanded our understanding ofthe cellular mechanisms used to transport mRNAs to differentdestinations and to maintain their localized distributions. Live-imaging studies have also provided new insight into the functionalorganization of the oocyte cytoskeleton and its use by mRNAtransport machinery. Detailed dynamic analysis has revealed intriguing similarities, as well as differences, in behavior among localized mRNAs. The useof a common dynein-mediated transport pathway in nurse the possibility that oocyte-destined mRNAs like grk, bcdand oskmight be packaged together into the same nurse cell transport particle. Remodeling of these particles upon their arrival in theoocyte would then segregate different component mRNAs intodistinct oocyte transport particles coupled to the appropriate motorsfor translocation within the oocyte. Such a co-transport model canbe tested either by co-injection of RNAs labeled with differentfluorophores or by using different RNA stemloop and cognateprotein pairs to label two different endogenous transcriptssimultaneously. Co-transport of different mRNAs to the yeast budtip has recently been observed using the latter method (Lange et al.,2008). In another direction, co-visualization of fluorescently labeled mRNAs and proteins will provide insight into the temporalregulation of RNP assembly and the remodeling events that alter thecomposition of RNP particles at different stages of the localizationprocess. Given the growing number of localization factors reportedto regulate multiple mRNAs, determining how these proteinscontribute to the localization of each target mRNA will be facilitatedby the ability to follow differentially labeled mRNA-protein pairs.For example, Stau coassembles with oskmRNA transport during mid-oogenesis and with bcd particles in late oocytes and in DEVELOPMENT COURSE BOOK PAGE 732502 early embryos, consistent with the genetic requirements for stau in oskand bcdmRNA localization at these stages (Weil et al., 2006; Weil et al., 2008; Zimyanin et al., 2008). One remaining gap in our knowledge stems from the inability to follow the entire path of an individual RNP particle en route to its destination, owing to the tendency of particles to move out of theplane of focus and to the photobleaching that occurs during longperiods of imaging at high resolution. The continuing generation ofbrighter and more photostable fluorophores together with thedevelopment of new microscopes that allow rapid imaging in fourdimensions hold the promise for another great leap forward.

DEVELOPMENT COURSE BOOK PAGE 75Developmental Cell Article Apical Secretion in Epithelial Tubes of the Drosophila Embryo Is Directed by the lamentous actin (F-actin) is a common feature of epithelial tubes in multicellularorganisms. However, its origins and function are notknown. We demonstrate that the Diaphanous (Dia)/ Formin required for F-actin in diverse types of epithelialtubes in the Drosophila embryo. Dia itself is apically localized both at the RNA and protein levels, andapical localization of its activators, including Rho1and two guanine exchange factor proteins (Rho-GEFs), contributes to its activity. In the absence ofapical actin polymerization, apical-basal polarity and microtubule organization cells remain intact; however, secretion through theapical surface to the lumen of organs isblocked. Apical secretion also vesicles aretargeted to membrane by MyoV-basedtransport, along polarized actin laments nucleatedby Dia. This mechanism allows efcient utilization of the entire apical membrane for secretion. INTRODUCTION Tubular epithelial networks are an essential component of the body plan in all multicellular organisms. Branched tubular struc-tures evolved to transfer solutes, hormones, nutrients, waste products, and air between tissues, thereby facilitating growth of the organism. Several features are common to all tubularstructures, despite their distinct functions. The tube cells are highly polarized, such that the protein and lipid composition of the apical membrane facing the lumen is distinct from the baso-lateral domain that is attached to the extracellular matrix. The epithelial cells comprising the tube wall form junctions that are essential for maintaining tube integrity, and provide a seal pre-venting leakage of substances from the lumen to the basolateralsurface, and vice versa ( Bryant and Mostov, 2008; Hogan and Kolodziej, 2002; O'Brien et al., 2002 ). Several mechanisms have been shown to generate polarity in epithelial tubes. In cases where the tubes are derived by invag- ination of polarized ectodermal cells (e.g., during formation of theDrosophila tracheal system or salivary glands, or the verte-brate lung), the original polarity is maintained during the forma-tion and elaboration of the tube ( Kerman et al., 2006; Lubarsky and Krasnow, 2003 ). Alternatively, cell clusters that are not yet polarized generate a lumen, as cells in the center of the clusteracquire apical-basal polarity (e.g., in the mammary gland and early Hogan and Kolodziej, 2002 ). Finally, polar- ized lumens may even be formed within a single cell. In the terminal cells of the Drosophila trachea, or in the excretory and fusion of apical vesicles leads to the formation of a continuous, polarized, intra-cellular tube ( Buechner et al., 1999; Ghabrial et al., 2003 ). Generation and maintenance of the polarized tube structure, requires distinct trafcking mechanisms of secretory vesiclesthat will supply the different components to each membranedomain. Regulated apical secretion was shown to be respon- sible for stereotyped tube diameter expansion Beitel glands Myat and Andrew, 2002 ). When the general secretory machinery was compromised by mutations in the COPII or COPI complexes, defects in luminal secretion of avariety of proteins were observed in the Drosophila tracheal system Devine et al., 2008; Tsarouhas et al., 2007 ). Since many epithelial tubes are actively involved in secretion of substances to the lumen, efcient vectorial traf-cking of secretory vesicles to the apical surface is essential, not only for generating and maintaining the tube, but also for carrying out the physiological function of the organ. Tubular epithelial networks display considerable diversity in size and architecture, and secrete distinct components to thelumen. Yet the similarity in cellular epithelial organization raisesthe possibility that common mechanisms may be involved in apical secretion. One unifying feature that was identied is the concentration of lamentous actin (F-actin) at the apical surfaceof the cells comprising the tube. Such organization of actin was observed in cells forming the trachea of Drosophila , and in mammalian Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells that are induced to form tubes in culture ( O'Brien et al., 2002; Tsarouhas et al., 2007 ). This dense organization of actin is distinct from the actin that is typically associated with adherens junctions, asit is present under the entire apical surface. The nucleationmachinery responsible for apical F-actin (commonly termed ''the terminal web''), as well as its functional role, have not been well explored. It has been suggested that the terminal webcontributes to the elastic properties of the cells lining the lumen. Dynamic alterations in the structure of the terminal web were observed upon stimulated secretion (e.g., in the lacrimal gland), Developmental Cell 16, 877-888, June 16, 2009 \u00aa2009 Elsevier Inc. 877 COURSE BOOK PAGE 76raising the possibility that it may either impede or facilitate regu- lated secretion to the lumen ( Jerdeva et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2006 ). In this work, we demonstrate that apical F-actin in epithelial tubes of the Drosophila embryo is generated by the Diaphanous (Dia)/Formin actin-nucleating factor. Formins constitute a diverse family of proteins found in all eukaryotes. They regulate nucle- ation of linear actin laments, which give rise to protruding lipo-dia or intracellular actin laments. Formins are involved in diversecellular processes, including cytokinesis, cell migration utilizing lipodia, focal adhesions, polarized cell growth, stabilization of adherens junctions ( Homem and Peifer, 2008 open conformation and dimerizes. The Formin- homology domain 2 within the protein initiates actin lament assembly, and remains associated with the fast-growing barbedend, allowing rapid insertion of monomeric actin, while protect-ing the end from capping proteins (reviewed by Goode and Eck [2007] ). We show that the Dia-induced apical actin nucleation mecha- nism is common to the tracheal network, salivary glands, hindgut, and Malpighian tubules. In the absence of Dia, while the overall polarity of the cellsand microtubule organization remains intact, apical F-actin is not formed. A complete block of secretion via the apical surface to the tube lumen is coupled to the loss of apical F-actin in alltubular organs examined, while proteins that are secreted to the lumen via septate junctions are not affected. Our data suggest that the apical restriction of Dia nucleating activity isa consequence of apical localization of the Dia-activatingmachinery, Rho1, and associated guanine exchange factors (GEFs), as well as of Dia itself. We further show that apical secre- tion requires the Myosin V (MyoV) motor thatsecretory vesicles are targeted to the apical, lumen-facing membrane by MyoV-based transport along polarized actin la- ments nucleated by Dia. This mechanism allows efcient utiliza-tion of the entire apical membrane for secretion, and appears to be general for distinct types of tubes, differing in their diameter, luminal composition, and physiological role. RESULTS Apical Filamentous Actin in Embryonic Tubular Networks Is Generated by Dia We explored the distribution of F-actin in tubular structures of theDrosophila embryo using tissue-specic expression of the GFP- tagged F-actin binding domain of Moesin ( Chihara et al., 2003 ), and observed a common apical localization. In the trachealsystem, apical F-actin is rst observed at stage 13 at the apical side of the cells forming the dorsal trunk. As the smaller tracheal tubes organize and form a lumen, F-actin appears ( Figures 1 A and 1C). F-actin detected Figures 1B and 1D-1G). To identify the molecular machinery responsible for formation of the apical layer of microlaments in these tubular organs, we interfered with the function of several prominent F-actin nucle- ating systems. To study the requirement for Dia in this context,we examined both embryos homozygous for a strong loss-of-function allele of dia(where maternally provided diatranscripts allow the embryos to proceed normally through the rst stagesof embryogenesis, where Dia is required for other processes[Homem and Peifer, 2008 ]), as well as embryos in which dia RNAi constructs were expressed in tubular structures, usingappropriate Gal4 drivers. Under both strategies, we observedloss of apical F-actin in the trachea, while residual F-actin in theadherens junctions was maintained ( Figures 1 H, 1J, 1M, and 1N). Maintenance of intact adherens junctions in the absence ofDia was also observed by the presence of Armadillo (Arm), andthe electron-dense structures observed at the junctions in trans- mission electron microscopy ( Figures 1 I-1L). In contrast, inacti- vation of another actin-nucleation factor, the Arp2/3 complex, had no effect. Specically, coexpression in the trachea of RNAi constructs for the Sop2 and Arp3 genes, encoding subunits of the Arp2/3 complex, did not alter the apical F-actin localization pattern ( Figure 1 O). When expressed in muscles, the same RNAi constructs phenocopied the Arp2/3 mutant phenotype (Massarwa et al., 2007 ), demonstrating their biological potency (Figures 1 P-1Q). Similar results were obtained in the hindgut and salivary glands (see Figure S1 available online). These results demonstrate that Dia is essential for the formation of the apical F-actin web in the cells comprising the various tubes, and is likely to be the primary actin nucleator operating in this context. Torule out the possibility that the absence of apical F-actin is a secondary consequence of disruptions to epithelial cell polarity, we monitored the localization pattern of different polarity markers in the diamutant background. These markers included Crumbs (Crb), which localizes to the apical membrane, DE-Cadherin and Arm, which concentrate at adherens junctions, and Discslarge (Dlg), which localizes to septate junctions ( Figures 2 A-2D). All markers exhibited normal localization in the tracheal tubesofdiamutant embryos ( Figures 2 E-2H), indicating that cell polarity is maintained. A similar conservation of cell polarity was observed in the hindgut and salivary glands of dia-mutant embryos ( Figure S2 ). Another of cell polarity, which impinges on targeted intracellular trafcking, is the organization of microtubules. The polarity of microtubules in Drosophila cells can be examined by Nod-lacZ, a microtubule minus-end-directed reporter ( Clark et al., 1997 ). We nd that Nod-lacZ is localized to the apical side of all embryonic epithelial tubes. Staining of microtubulesby antibodies directed against b-tubulin demonstrates that Nod-lacZ is concentrated at the apical end of the domain harboring microtubules, indicating that microtubule polarization remained intact in the absence of Dia ( Figures 2 I and 2J; Figure S2 ). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that crucial aspects of epithelial cell polarity, including distinctmembrane domains and microtubule organization, remain fullyintact when Dia function is disrupted. The observed loss of apical F-actin in this background is thus likely to be a direct result of impaired Dia-nucleating activity. Dia mRNA and Protein Are Apically Localized The apical concentration of F-actin generated by Dia promptedus to examine the basis for the apical focus of Dia activity. Dia displays a widespread and dynamic expression pattern during early and mid-stages of embryogenesis (data not shown).Developmental Cell Diaphanous Regulates Apical Secretion 878 Developmental Cell 16, 877-888, June 16, 2009 \u00aa2009 Elsevier Inc. COURSE BOOK PAGE 77However, from embryonic stage 14 and onward, diamRNA is found predominantly within cells that form tubular structures, including the trachea, hindgut, salivary glands, Malpighian tubules, and the outer layer the proventriculus ( Figures 3 A and 3B). More- over, within each of these epithelial structures, the mRNA is tightly concentrated at the apical side ( Figures 3 C-3G). The apical local- ization of diamRNA is mirrored at the protein level. Staining with anti-Dia antibodies shows that Dia protein persists in mosttissues even during advanced stages of embryogenesis. At these stages, Dia protein exhibits a polarized apical localization speci-cally within the tubular structures, similar to diamRNA, while a uniform distribution is observed in the other tissues ( Figures 3H-3L). The activity of the diaRNAi construct could be demon- strated by disappearance of Dia protein in tissues where it wasinduced ( Figure 3 M). To examine the mechanism for apical localization of diamRNA and protein, we expressed a dia-GFP construct in which the 3 0 untranslated region (UTR) was removed ( Homem and Peifer, 2008 ). This mRNA, monitored in situ by a GFP probe, loses its apical localization ( Figure 3 N), demonstrating that the 30UTRcontains sequences required for apical targeting. However, theDia-GFP protein remained apically localized, as determined by the GFP label ( Figures 3 O and 3P). Thus, a distinct apical target- ing mechanism for the Dia protein, operating only within tubular epithelial cells, is sufcient for localization, even when the mRNA is uniformly distributed within these cells. Dia Is Required for Secretion to the Lumen of Tubular Organs A central feature of tubular epithelial cells is their ability to secreteproteins to the tube lumen. We followed the distribution of several proteins normally secreted into tubular lumens to determine whether secretion was affected by loss of Dia and apical F-actin.Antibodies to the 2A12 antigen and to other secreted proteinsnormally detect secretion to the lumen of the trachea beginning at stage 13 of embryogenesis ( Tsarouhas et al., 2007 ). The 2A12 antigen was absent from the lumen of the trachea in dia mutant embryos and following diaRNAi expression, and only traces could occasionally be detected within the cells comprising the smaller tubes ( Figures 4 A-4C).

To ascertain that the defect was indeed in secretion and not in synthesis of the 2A12 protein, we blockedtrafcking to the lysosome by expressing an RNAi constructfordeep orange (dor)(Sriram et al., 2003 ). When expressed alone in the trachea, accumulation of 2A12 in the lumen isnormal and, in addition, some apical intracellular accumulationis also observed. When both doranddiaRNAi constructs were expressed, no secretion of 2A12 to the lumen was observeddue to the absence of Dia, but apical accumulation within thetracheal cells was detected ( Figures 4 D and 4E). Accumulation of 2A12 antigen within the tracheal cells was also observedwhen a diamutant was combined with a sar1 mutant (encoding a subunit of the CopII trafcking complex), as a consequence of an early block in the secretory pathway (( Tsarouhas et al., 2007 ) and Figure S3 ). We can conclude that the 2A12 antigen is properly synthesized in the diamutant background, but is rapidly targeted to degradation when a late step in secretion fails. Another protein secreted by several tubular structures is the ZP-domain protein Piopio (Pio) ( Figures 4 F, 4K, and 4N and Jazwinska et al. [2003] ). This protein contains a signal peptide and transmembrane domain, where the extracellular domain is constitutively cleaved upon maturation. Secreted Pio was shown Figure 2.

In dia mutants, secretion of Pio is blocked in glands(Figures 4 G, 4H, 4L, 4M, 4O, and 4P). Again, the Pio protein that failed to besecreted did not accumulate within thecells. Labeling of the tracheal cytoplasm ofdiamutant embryos demonstrates discontinuities in the dorsal branches (Figures 4 I and 4J resem- bling ). We also tested secretion of the ANF-GFP protein in the trachea ( Tsarouhas et al., 2007 ), and observed loss of secretion in the absence of Dia ( Figure S4 ). Thus, Dia appears to be required for apical secretion of multipleproteins. The terminal cells of the trachea a unique type of intracel- lular lumen ( Ghabrial et al., 2003 ), which can be detected by anti- bodies directed against proteins, such as 2A12. The formation ofthis internal lumen is different from the lumens of the primary andsecondary branches, where cells secrete material to the apical extracelullar space. While the cellular extensions of the terminal cells can be detected in diamutant embryos, they do not contain the 2A12 antigen ( Figure S4 F), indicating that Dia is also required for the intracellular targeting of proteins toward the coalescingvesicles, that form the lumen of terminal cells. Dia Is Required for Secretion of a Distinct Class of VesiclesProper localization of Crb to the apical membrane of tracheal tubes in diamutants while protein secretion to the lumen is blocked suggests that multiple routes are employed in trafcking protein cargo to the apical surface in these cells. Verm and Serp,chitin-modifying enzymes that are deposited in the tracheal lumen, were previously shown to require septate junctions forDevelopmental Cell Diaphanous Regulates Apical Secretion 880 Developmental Cell 16, 877-888, June 16, 2009 \u00aa2009 Elsevier Inc. COURSE BOOK PAGE 79their secretion. Compromising the structure of the septate junc- tions leads to failure to secrete these proteins to the lumen, whilethe secretion of 2A12 and Pio is unaffected ( Luschnig et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006 ). When we examined the secretion of the Verm and Serp proteins in a diamutant background, we observed normal secretion ( Figures 4 Q-4S; Figures S3 and S4). This strengthens previous ndings that the chitin-modifying enzymes are secreted by a distinct class of vesicles, which is nottargeted apically. Dia is apparently required only for secretion ofproteins that are packaged in apically secreted vesicles. The specic effect of diamutants on secretion of a distinct class of vesicles, rather than a global effect on vesicle trafcking, was also ascertained by demonstrating a normal distribution of endo- plasmic reticulum, Golgi, and recycling endocytosis of Verm from the tracheal lumen at stage 17 ( Figures 4 T and 4U). Dia Is Activated Apically by Rho1 and Two Rho-GEFsActivation of Dia-type Formins is commonly triggered by Rho and associated Rho-GEFs ( Goode and Eck, 2007 ). We wanted to examine the localization and activity of these proteins, in the context of secretion by epithelial tube cells. The Rho1 proteinshows an apical localization in tracheal tubes ( Figure 5 A). Furthermore, of PKNG58AeGFP, a GFP sensor foractive Rho1 ( Simoes et ), demonstrates that activation is apically restricted ( Figure 5 B). The Rho1 sensor can function as a Rho1-dominant negative, and its expression indeed leadsto loss of 2A12 antigen secretion ( Figure 5 B). A similar effect isobserved following expression of either Rho1 RNAi or domi-nant-negative constructs ( Figures 5 C and 5D), demonstrating the central role of Rho1 as a critical regulator of Dia. Since Rho1 is tethered to the membrane, its apical localization is particularly important in guiding polarized synthesis of F-actinby Dia. Thus, Dia will generate polarized actin cables, the barbed ends of which are embedded within the apical membrane. The two Rho-GEFs, Gef2 and Gef64C, were previously shown to trigger Rho1 Simoes et al., 2006 ). Both Gef2 and display an apical protein localization tracheal cells ( Figures 5E and 5F). The apical localization of the pair of Rho-GEFs and Rho1 was also demonstrated in other tubular organs (Figure S6 ). When the level of Gef2 in the trachea was compro- mised by using a mutant background ( Figure 5 H), or by expres- sion of an RNAi construct ( Figure 6 B), a block in secretion of 2A12 to the tracheal lumen was observed. Similar results were obtained in the Gef64C mutant background ( Figure 5 I), or following expression of Gef64C RNAi ( Figure 6 C), indicating that both Rho-GEFs are essential for apical secretion. Removalof one copy of either Gefgene has no effect ( Figure S7 ). However, a strong block in secretion was observed in embryos that are transheterozygous for mutations in the two Rho-GEFs, ( Fig- ure 5 J), suggesting that apical secretion requires a cumulative level of the two Rho-GEF proteins above a critical threshold.When present at sufciently high levels, either GEF can drive2A12 secretion, as demonstrated by the ability of Gef64C over- expression to rescue Gef2 mutant or Gef2 ( Figure S7 ). Markers of cell polarity display a normal Figure 3. diamRNA and Protein Are Apically Localized in Diverse Tubular Organs (A and B) Starting at embryonic stage 14, dia mRNA begins to be detected predominantly in tubular organs, and this pattern becomes moreprominent by stages 15 (A) and 16 (B).(C-G) Within each one of the tubular glands, to the apical side facing the tube lumen.

(O and P) The ectopic Dia-GFP protein was followed by staining for GFP (green), and shows a normal apical localization with respect to the tracheal nuclei (Trh,blue) at stages 12 and 15, respectively.

We also wanted to test whether compromising the activity of Rho-GEFs or Rho1 gives rise to defects in the immediate output of Dia activity, namely, the nucleation of apical F-actin. When RNAi constructs for expressed in trachea, hindgut, or salivary glands, loss of apical F-actin was observed concomitant with defects in secretion ( Figure 6 ). These results strengthen the causal link between Dia-mediatedactin polymerization and apical secretion.Dia Activation Determines the Onset of Secretion We used Rho1 V14, an activated form of Rho1, to validate the functional hierarchy between the Rho-GEFs, Rho1 and Dia, in tracheal cells. No defects in tracheal development or secretionwere observed following expression of Rho V14in wild-type embryos ( Figure 5 L), likely due to the restricted apical localiza- tion of the protein. Expression of the same construct rescuedthe secretion defect in Gef2 -o r Gef64C- RNAi-expressing embryos ( Figure 5 M and data not shown), but failed to do so in dia-RNAi-expressing embryos ( Figure 5 N), thus demonstrating Figure 4.

COURSE BOOK PAGE 81the expected functional epistatic relationship between the three proteins. Apical secretion of proteins, like 2A12 and Pio, in the trachea is temporally regulated and is observed long after the lumen of thetracheal pits is formed at stage 11, suggesting a regulatory switchfor onset of secretion. The high sensitivity of the system to thelevels of the two Rho-GEFs that activate Rho1, suggests that activation of Rho1 may provide such a trigger. To test this notion, we examined the effects of activated Rho1 at earlier stages oftracheal development. Secretion was initiated at early stages of tracheal formation, and could be readily detected already at stage 12 ( Figure 5 P). This premature apical secretion is depen-dent on activation of Dia, since no secretion was observedwhen activated Rho1 was expressed in the presence of RNAifordia(Figure 5 Q). Conversely, activated Rho1 continued to trigger premature secretion in Gef2 -o rGef64C- RNAi-expressing embryos ( Figure 5 R and data not shown). These results suggest that, normally, the machinery for apical localization of the criticalcomponents is already operational at early stages of tube morphogenesis, but that the activation of Dia takes place only at a subsequent phase. We wanted to examine if the mechanism of apical localization of Rho-GEFs, Rho1 and Dia, is dependent on, or facilitated by,the apical actin cables formed by Dia. When the localization of Figure 5.

The results suggest that the schedule of Dia activation is determined by a threshold for activation of Rho1 by GEFs. Asterisk indicates apical position.

Further- more, Dia retains its normal distribution in a Rho1-RNAi background ( Figure S6 ). Thus, the apical localization of the upstream Dia regulators, and of Dia itself, is independent of Dia activity. MyoV Transports Cargo Vesicles Apically on Actin Cables The simultaneous of apical actin organization andapically directed secretion in diamutants suggests that the Dia-nucleated actin laments serve as tracks for polarized secre-tion. The actin-based MyoV motors have been linked to polarizedsecretion in a variety of biological systems ( Reck-Peterson et al., 2000 ). A 1998; MacIver et al., 1998 ). To assess its role in tubular organ secretion, we specically inactivated myoV in et al., 2007 ). While secretion of 2A12 and Pio was abolished in these organs, the apical distribution of F-actin was not per- turbed ( Figures 7 A-7J). MyoV protein is detected in a punctate distribution, and is eliminated from the tracheal cells following expression of an RNAi construct by btl-Gal4 . In the trachea of myoV mutant embryos that develop to late stages, absence of 2A12 secretion, but normal Verm secretion, is detected. Finally, Figure 6.

(I-L) Pio is lumen secretion and abolished apical F-actin accumulation (Dlg,blue; Pio, red). localization of MyoV is not altered in dia mutants and vice versa, and cell polarity markers are normal in embryos express- ingmyoV RNAi in the trachea ( Figure S9 ). The functional connection between MyoV and the Dia pathway was demon-strated by the ability to block premature secretion in the trachea, which wasinduced by activated RNAi construct ( Figures 7 K-7N). These observations are consistent with a scenario whereby MyoVacts as a motor for trafcking secreted vesicles apically along actin cables generated by Dia. DISCUSSION Apical localization of F-actin is a general feature of tubular epithelial structures. It was observed in mammalian MDCK cells forming tubes in three-dimensional cell culture ( O'Brien et al., 2002 ), in the cytoplasm underlying the apical membrane facing the lumen in mammalian secretory organs, such as the lacrimal gland ( Jerdeva et al., 2005 ), and in the different epithelial tubes of the Drosophila embryo ( Tsarouhas et al., 2007 )(Figure 1 ; Figure S1 ). The lower level of gene duplication in Drosophila , and the ability to follow the consequences of targeted gene inac- tivation in the tubular structures, allowed us to identify the mech- anism responsible for nucleating the actin terminal web at theapical side of epithelial tube cells. We demonstrate that Dia, which is known to promote the formation of linear actin laments, is responsible for producing this actin network in Drososphila embryonic tubular structures. Despite differences in the diam- eter and function of the different tubular organs, the polarized apical actin cables formed by Dia appear to have a commonrole in trafcking secretory vesicles Apical Secretion 884 Developmental Cell 16, 877-888, June 16, 2009 \u00aa2009 Elsevier Inc. COURSE BOOK PAGE 83While the role of Dia in promoting apical secretion spans the entire duration of tracheal morphogenesis, two other Formin- homology proteins junctions of Drosophila tracheal morphogenesis. Formin 3 participates in the generationof dorsal trunk tube by promoting vesicular traf- cking in the fusion cells of each metamer, perpendicular to the tube lumen ( Tanaka et al., 2004 ). Another Formin domain protein, DAAM, promotes the organization of F-actin in rings around the circumference of the tracheal tube, at the nal stages of tracheal morphogenesis ( Matusek et al., 2006 ).It is likely that each of the three Formin domain proteins is regu- lated by distinct activators that are concentrated at differentsites. The localized activation of Formin 3 may eventually leadto polarized vesicle movement, similar to Dia, but towarda different membrane. The activation of DAAM may be necessary for the localized synthesis of F-actin, which will modify the contours of the apical membrane, and thus dene the shape ofchitin layered on top. The function of Dia stands out, since it is required throughout tracheal development, and is also involved in morphogenesis of other tubular organs. Figure 7.

Similar results were obtained following expression of activatedDia alone (M), or in combination with myoV RNAi (N). Asterisks show apical positions.(O and P) Model for apical secretion in tubularstructures. In diverse tubular structures, the singleepithelial cell layer is highly polarized. Polarity ismaintained by the adherens junction (AJ) andseptate junction (SJ), forming tight barriers. Apicallocalization of the Dia activators (Rho-GEFs andRho1), and Dia itself, promote the formation ofpolarized actin cables emanating from the apicalmembrane, with their barbed ends facing themembrane. This allows efcient trafcking byMyoV motors of a specic class of secretory vesi-cles toward the apical membrane. It is possiblethat, prior to loading of the vesicles onto MyoVmotors and actin cables, they reach the generalvicinity of the apical domain by microtubule- based mechanisms.

Thus,we did not observe any defects in overall polarity in diamutant embryos ( Figure 2 ;Figure S2 ). It seems that the steps upstream to Dia activation utilize the existing polarity at multiple tiers inorder to trigger Dia at a highly restricted position. The two Rho-GEF proteins, Gef2 and Gef64C, exhibit a tight apical localization in the cells forming the tubes. The single Rho1 protein, which is downstream to the Rho-GEFs, is again tightly localized to theapical surface in tubular structures ( Figure 5 ). Binding of Rho1 to Dia leads to an opening of the autoinhibited form of Dia andto the formation of a Dia dimer representing the active form(Goode and Eck, 2007 ). Since GTP-bound Rho1 is the immediate activator of Dia, it is particularly important that Rho1 beembedded in the apical membrane, to polymerization. In C. elegans , a GEF and a Rho protein were shown to be essential for the development of the lumen of the excretory cell ( Suzuki et al., 2001 ). It will be inter- esting to determine if a Dia-family protein is subsequently acti- vated to promote secretion. Dia is also apically localized, both at the mRNA and protein levels ( Figure 3 ). Elimination of the dia3 0UTR demonstrated a persistence of apical protein localization, even when mRNA localization was lost, suggesting that there are two parallel and independent mechanisms for apical localization. The multipletiers of apical localization assure that activated Dia will be highly restricted to the apical surface. It is interesting to note that, while Gef2, Gef64C, Rho1, and Dia proteins are broadly expressed, partially due to maternal contri- bution of mRNA, they exhibit apical localization only in the tubular structures ( Figures 3 and 5 ). This raises the possibility that genes that are specically expressed in the tubular organs contribute to the apical localization. Alternatively, apical localization may rely directly on the specic phospholipid composition of the apical tube membranes. It will be interesting to determine ifa common mechanism is responsible for the apical localization of the different proteins in the pathway, and if this mechanism relies on components that are restricted to the tubular organs. The cellular machinery which dictates the apical localization of Rho-GEFs/Rho1/Dia appears to be in place early on. For example, expression of Dia-GFP in the trachea demonstrated apical localization of the protein already at the stage when thetracheal pits are formed ( Figure 3 P). Yet, generation of the polar- ized actin cables by Dia, and their utilization for secretion, takesplace at a later stage, and follows a stereotypic temporal order inthe different tracheal branches. What triggers activation of Dia, following the apical localization of the different components? We have demonstrated that both Gef2 and Gef64C are requiredto trigger Rho1, which activates Dia. While the activity of the two Rho-GEFs is similar, both have to accumulate to a critical level in order to activate the system ( Figures 5 H-5J). Thus, no secretion takes place when either of them is missing, or when each of themis present at half dose. The delay in activation of Dia and in secre- tion, may be explained by the time required to accumulate suf- cient levels of Rho-GEF proteins. When the system was ''shortcircuited'' by expression of activated Rho1, which was properly localized to the apical surface, Dia-dependent apical secretionwas observed already at early stages of tracheal pit formation (Figures 5 P and 5Q). Cargo Vesicles Are Transported Apically on ActinCables by MyoVOur results identify Drosophila MyoV primary motor for vesicles along the polarized, Dia- nucleated actin cables in tubular organs. When the activity of MyoV was compromised in the tubular epithelia, apical secretionof cargos requiring Dia-generated actin cables was abolished. On the other hand, since MyoV operates downstream to Dia, the actin cables themselves remained intact ( Figure 7 ). An anal- ogous role for MyoV has been cking of Rhodopsins to photoreceptor rhabdomers ( Li et al., 2007 ). The functional link between the Dia pathway and MyoV was demonstrated by the ability of myoV RNAi to suppress constitutively activated Rho1 or Dia phenotypes ( Figures 7 L and 7N). These results further support the direct link between Dia and apical secretion. A model describing the mechanismof Dia-regulated apical secretion in tubular organs is presented inFigures 7 O and 7P. The polarized actin network formed via the nucleating activity of Dia can account for the nal phase of secretory vesicle trans-port to the apical plasma membrane. Class V myosins, such as MyoV, are known to be involved in transfer of vesicles frommicrotubules to cortical actin networks ( may promote thelong-range trafcking of the secretory vesicles from their sitesof formation to the cell cortex. Consistent with this scenario,we have demonstrated a polarized arrangement of microtubules in tube epithelial cells, the minus ends of which are in close prox- imity to the apical membrane, which remains intact in theabsence of Dia ( Figure 2 ;Figure S2 ). The universality of this system is highlighted by similarities to polarized secretion inbudding yeast, where Myo2p-mediated transport of secretoryvesicles into the bud utilizes Dia-generated actin bundles as tracks, in order to deposit the compounds for polarized cell growth ( Faix and Grosse, 2006 ). Actin Cables Promote the Apical Secretionof a Distinct Class of Vesicles When early steps in the secretory pathway are compromised by reducing the activity of the COPII or COPI complexes, accumu-lation of cargo is observed within the cells and reduced amounts are detected in the lumen ( Devine et al., 2005; Jayaram et al., 2008; Tsarouhas et al., 2007 ). Since these manipulations block an early and global process of secretion, all cargo vesicles areaffected ( Tsarouhas et al., 2007 ). However, after exit from the Golgi, it appears that distinct classes of vesicles are generated, each containing a different set of cargos, and trafcked by a distinct mechanism. One class of vesicles contains chitin- modifying enzymes (such as Verm or Serp), and is targeted tothe septate junctions. When the structure of the septate junc-tions was compromised, these proteins failed to be secreted (Luschnig et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006 ). Another class of vesi- cles may contain transmembrane proteins that are deposited in theapical membrane, such as Crb. Our study now uncovers a third class of cargo vesicles. Several distinct cargos that are secreted to the apical rely on Dia forDevelopmental Cell Diaphanous Regulates Apical Secretion 886 Developmental Cell 16, 877-888, June 16, 2009 \u00aa2009 Elsevier Inc. COURSE BOOK PAGE 85their secretion. These cargos include the 2A12 antigen, Pio, and the articial rat ANF-GFP construct. In the absence of Dia, these proteins failed to be secreted to the lumen, but also did not accu- mulate within the epithelial tube cells ( Figure 4 ;Figure S4 ). We believe that when secretion is disrupted, the vesicles are ef- ciently targeted for lysosomal degradation, since a block of lyso- somal targeting facilitated intracellular accumulation of vesiclesthat failed to be secreted ( Figure 4 E). Inability to secrete Pio resulted in tracheal defects that were similar to piomutant embryos. Additional defects of diapathway mutant embryos, such as highly convoluted tracheal branches (compare Figures 2I and 2J), may stem from the absence of additional, yet unknown, proteins in the lumen. The mechanisms underlyingthe incorporation of distinct cargos into different secretory vesi-cles, as well as the recognition of each vesicle type by different motors and trafcking scaffolds, remain unknown. In conclusion, this work has uncovered a universal mechanism, which operates in very different types of tubular epithelial struc- tures in Drosophila . The conserved feature of network in tubular epithelia of diverse multicellular organisms,and the high degree of conservation of the different componentsgenerating and utilizing these actin structures, strongly suggests that this polarized secretion mechanism is broadly used across phyla. The ability to generate polarized actin cables that initiateat the apical membrane provides an efcient route for trafcking vesicles by MyoV, leading to their fusion with the apical membrane and secretion. It is likely that different pathologicalsituations manifested in aberrant formation of epithelial struc- tures, or their utilization for secretion once the tubular organ is formed, represent defects in different components of thispathway.

Cold solution (20 ml) was quicklyadded, and embryos chilled on ice before devitellinization in heptane/meth-anol. EM procedure was carried out according to ( Massarwa et al., 2007 ).

Germcells thus serve as an excellent model for studying cellmigration in the context of the live organism. In recent years, anumber of cues directing the migration of the cells towards their target were identied and some of the relevant molecules and biochemical pathways were revealed.

All rights reserved. DOI 10.1016/j.ceb.2010.09.005 Introduction Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are specied early in de- velopment at a position that is distant from the gonad,where they differentiate into gametes, sperm and egg. Hence, the cells have to migrate through the complex environment of a developing embryo to reach the regionof the developing gonad. The mechanisms facilitating the motility and controlling the directed migration of these cells are relevant for a wide range of processes in normaldevelopment and disease, thus keeping PGCs as a focus of scientic interest for decades. These studies, per- formed primarily in Drosophila , zebrash and mouse have unfolded the basic mechanisms controlling PGC gui-dance and motility and revealed that barring a number of differences, the principal characteristics of PGC migration appear to be conserved among different organ-isms; immediately following their specication, PGCs of Drosophila and zebrash exhibit a simple round morphology and are non-motile [ 1 /C15,2,3/C15]. Subsequently, the germ cells polarize and actively migrate at a stagecorresponding to the time of zygotic transcriptioninitiation [ 3 /C15,4]. Similarly, using electron microscopy analysis mouse PGCs were shown to be stationary and round before assuming a motile behavior [ 5]. In the mouse, the initiation of PGC migration appears to relyon paracrine cues from surrounding somatic and extra-embryonic tissues [ 2,6], while the role of the somatic environment remains unclear in the case of PGC motilityinDrosophila and zebrash embryos. Zebrash PGCs isolated from embryos at migratory stages show normal motility when transplanted into embryos of premigratory stages, suggesting that the early somatic environment ispermissive for PGC migration [ 3 /C15]. However, a putative role for the soma in inducing the transition to cell motilityhas not been ruled out in both organisms. Following this initial stage of PGC development, repul- sive and attractive cues provided by the environment canbias the inherent motility of the germ cells, culminating in directed migration of the cells towards their targets [7-10]. As the mechanisms controlling germ-cell migration in different organisms have been recently described in a comprehensive review by Richardson and Lehmann [ 11 /C15/C15], we will focus here on the 'mechanics' of PGC migration and on intracellular sig- naling controlling germ-cell motility. Migration challenges Migrating germ cells have to overcome several hurdles. First, the migration takes place along and through tissues that undergo extensive morphogenetic movements them- selves and has to be completed relatively quickly.Inability to reach their target early enough in embryonic development carries the risk of becoming 'locked' within a differentiated environment that presents barriers thatare more difcult or impossible to penetrate and lacks the factors essential for germ-cell survival [ 1 /C15,12/C15,13,14/C15,15/C15]. In spite of the crowded and complex cellular environment through which germ cells migrate, they can exhibit rela- tively high migration speeds in vivo of up to 140 mm/h [16-18], a speed range comparable to that of cancer cells that face similar challenges (e.g. about 120 mm/h for breast cancer cells migrating individually in vivo [19]). Interestingly, in a manner similar to that of metastatic tumor cells, zebrash germ cells meet the requirement forhigh speed and flexibility in migrating through the com- plex environment by generating blebs, a special type of cellular protrusions [ 20,21 ]. A related challenge the germ cells encounter is thenecessity to generate traction force that would allow themto actively migrate in a context of their cellular environ- ment. This task is complicated by the fact that the germ www.sciencedirect.com Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2010, 22:715 -721 COURSE BOOK PAGE 88cells migrate through diverse cellular environments and tissues with which they have to physically interact. The solution employed by germ cells in different organisms isto make use of the ubiquitously expressed cell -cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin. Indeed, proper controlof E-cadherin function was shown to be essential forthe process of germ-cell migration both in vertebrates and Drosophila [22-25,26 /C15/C15]. Signicantly, as will be further discussed below, regulation of E-cadherin levels was shown to be important also for cancer-cell metastasis and invasive cell migration during normal development (e.g. [ 27,28 ]). Last, following the acquisition of basic motility, cellmigration has to be directed by cues in the environment,enabling the cells to reach their targets. Whereas ligands, receptors and second messengers involved in biasing the direction of the motility are well known, less is knownabout the precise molecular cascade that polarizes the cells in the correct direction. Get in shape In essence, cell migration includes protrusion formation in the direction of the migration and pulling the back ofthe cell that together result in forward movement. Con- sequently, migrating cells are easily recognizable by dynamic cell-shape alterations as compared to theirimmotile neighbors. Two major strategies for producing cellular protrusions have been described. The more extensively studied type is the lamellipodium, wherepolymerization of actin laments provides the physical force pushing the plasma membrane in the direction of migration [ 29]. However, an increasing number of recent reports suggest blebs as an additional mechanism for protrusion formation that can support invasive cell migration in vivo [30]. Blebs are dened as membrane inflation driven by hydrostatic pressure and cytoplasmic streaming [ 31 /C15,32]. The formation of the bleb initiates with a separation of the plasma membrane from the actin cortex at a given site and is powered by subsequent flow of cytoplasm that further expands the protrusion. Persist- ent formation of such protrusions in a specic direction,coupled with attachment of the cell front to the environ- ment and retraction of the back, result in a net forward displacement. Considering that bleb-based motility pre-sumably requires less energy [ 33], and that blebs form relatively fast, while easily adapting to the shape of the environment, it constitutes a useful strategy for rapid cell motility in the 3-dimentional environment of the embryo. A formation of a protrusion at the cell front is key to directional migration. In the case of the lamellipodium,enhanced actin turnover at the front of the cell leads to polarized protrusion at this aspect of the cell. Two models were suggested for directing blebs to the cell front, bothrelying on localized myosin activity at the cell cortex. Increased myosin-based contractility at the cell frontcould result in elevated local pressure that separatesthe membrane from the cortex at this location, thereby nucleating a bleb that expands in response to furthercytoplasm streaming [ 34,35 ]. Alternatively, the localiz- ation of the bleb to the cell front is dictated by localreduction of the adhesion between the membrane and thecell cortex as a result of contractility-induced breaks in the actomyosin cortex [ 31 /C15]. Last, nucleation of blebs could result from asymmetric distribution of cortex - membrane linker molecules that dene a region of wea-kened membrane -cortex adhesion where a bleb is more likely to form [ 20,31 /C15,36,37 ]. Thus, bleb-based motility is characterized by separation between the membrane and the cell cortex and lack ofpolymerized actin in the forming protrusion. These fea- tures were clearly demonstrated in an in vitro setting for migrating tumor cells (M2 melanoma, neuroblastoma and Walker carcinoma cells) [ 20,38,39 ]. Such a demonstration poses a greater challenge in in vivo contexts where the accessibility of the embryo and the optical properties ofthe tissue limit the spatial and temporal resolution of the imaging. It is for that reason that the properties of the leading edge were not directly examined for mouse germcells, while the germ cells of Drosophila appear to form bleb-like protrusions, at least during some stages of theirmigration. Specically, xed Drosophila germ cells exhibit thinning of the cortical actin at the base of the protrusion that itself appears to be devoid of polymerized actin [ 1 /C15]. Employing other methods such as illumina- tion microscope (SPIM) having higher temporal resol- ution for live imaging of germ-cell migration might solve the question of the precise cellular mechanism governingprotrusion formation in mouse and Drosophila [ 40]. Unlike in mouse and Drosophila , the translucent nature of the zebrash embryo and the relatively superciallocation of the migrating cells allowed this issue to be examined using relatively simple microscopy. The inves- tigation revealed that zebrash germ cells utilize predo-minantly blebs in their forward movement [ 41]. The polarized formation of blebs at the cell front correlatedwith elevation of calcium, a second messenger that couldinduce bleb formation when introduced at ectopic locations [ 41]. The site of bleb formation is further characterized by activation of the small RhoGTPases RhoA and Rac1 [ 26 /C15/C15]. Importantly, whereas guidance cues direct the polarity and migration of the cells, in theabsence of such cues, zebrash germ cells do polarize andmigrate albeit, non directionally [ 9]. An interesting ques- tion that arises in this context concerns the mechanisms responsible for the directional cue-independent polariz- ation of blebbing activity and migration. Proteins thatcould participate in establishing the apparent polarity with respect to bleb formation include structural com- ponents of the actomyosin cortex, and regulators of itscontractility (e.g. kinases activating myosin contraction), proteins and lipids involved in facilitating membrane -716 Cell differentiation Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2010, 22:715 -721 www.sciencedirect.com COURSE BOOK PAGE 89cortex binding (e.g. ERM (Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) proteins and regulators of their activity) and G-protein coupled receptors. For example, a possible scenario is thatG-protein coupled receptors stochastically activate phos- pholipase C (PLC), which in turn would reduce PIP2 levels in the membrane. Local hydrolysis of PIP2 coulddecrease the adhesion between the cytoskeleton, trigger IP3-dependent colin- triggered actin polymerization at the cell front andelevation in Calcium levels that could enhance myosin contraction [ 42-44] thereby establishing a leading edge. Indeed, whereas a detailed understanding of germ-cell polarization is still lacking, some of the molecular com- ponents listed above have been shown to play a role in germ-cell motility, for example the G-protein coupledreceptor Tre-1 of Drosophila ], lipids that could affect the activation of G-protein coupled receptors[46] and the lipid composition of the cell membrane [ 47]. Love thy neighbor Whereas the generation of protrusions is crucial for cellmotility, the actual translocation of the cell mass forward requires interactions with the environment. The inter- actions of a migrating cell with its surrounding includespushing against structures in the environment, squeezing within conned spaces, adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) or to neighboring cells [ 48-50]. In mouse, several types of collagen, bronectin and tentactin-C are expressed along the germ-cell migration route [ 51,52 ], consistent with the idea that ECM components play a role in germ-cell migration [ 53]. Indeed, b1-integrin was shown to be expressed by mouse germ cells and to beimportant for their in vivo migration to genital ridges [ 54]. However, mouse germ cells were capable of migrating in vitro in the absence of somatic cells or any dened matrix support, suggesting that at least some steps of theirmigration could be ECM independent [ 55].Drosophila germ cells lacking b-integrin can reach their target [1 /C15,56], suggesting that despite indications that the base- ment membrane component laminin might play a role in germ-cell migration [ 1/C15,56], integrin -ECM interactions appear dispensable. Similar to these results, interfering with PGC -ECM interactions in zebrash did not affect the ability of the cells to reach their target [ 26/C15/C15]. It remains to be determined whether despite the fact thatthe cells can reach the gonad independently of the ECM,their migration is affected as manifested in altered speed, morphology or other dynamic parameters. Together, these results suggest that the interaction with theECM probably plays a relatively minor role in facilitating germ-cell motility. An important clue concerning the molecular basis for interaction between germ cells andtheir environment stems from the observation that iso- lated Drosophila and zebrash germ cells tend to adhere to one another [ 1 /C15,26/C15/C15], raising the possibility that cell -cell interaction plays a role in the generation of traction force.An attractive candidate for mediating cell -cell adhesion isE-cadherin, a molecule that is ubiquitously expressed inthe embryo and could thus promote the interaction of germ cells with cells of different tissues. Indeed, E-cadherin was shown to be involved in germ-cell migration in different organisms; in Drosophila and zebrash for example, E-cadherin expression level decreases just before the cells become motile, suggesting that tight control of cell -cell adhesion level is required for migration [ 3 /C15,24,25 ]. In mouse, E-cadherin is necessary for PGC migration out of the hindgut [ 22,23 ], while in Drosophila , DE-Cadherin facilitates PGC polarization and is important for gonad coalescence at later stages [ 24,25 ]. In zebrash, E-cadherin appears to supports PGC motilityduring the entire migratory phase such that alteration of its activity leads to strong inhibition of germ-cell loco-motion [ 3 /C15,26/C15/C15]. Interestingly, reduction of E-cadherin activity is sufcient to promote tumor cell metastasis andis correlated with poor prognosis [ 57-59]; similar to the events at the initiation of germ-cell migration, E-cadherin activity is reduced to allow cancer cells to leave their tissue of origin. However, unlike E-cadherin essentialrole during germ-cell migration, tumor cells appear to invade tissues also in an E-cadherin independent fashion. In the context of normal development, homophilic cell - cell adhesion was shown to play an important role, for example in Drosophila where E-cadherin functions to promote the migration of border cells on the surface of the nurse cells during oogenesis [ 28,60,61 ]. The mech- anisms by which E-cadherin contributes to cell motilitywere investigated in zebrash PGCs. There, as a result ofenhanced Rac1 and RhoA activity at the cell front, actin belts are generated that undergo retrograde flow. The binding of E-cadherin to these actin structures within thecell and to external E-cadherin on neighboring cells, allows traction forces to be established [ 26 /C15/C15]. This course of events is reminiscent of the scenario described for N- cadherin-mediated neuronal growth cone migration, where N-cadherin and intracellular actin flow are mechanically coupled [ 62]. Several interesting questions remain to be explored regarding the model implicating cell-cell adhesion in promoting germ-cell migration; the precise control over the level of E-cadherin expression that is essential for proper migration is not known and specically, whether it involves transcription regulation (e.g. [ 63,64 ]) or operates at the posttranscriptional level (e.g. [ 65]). Also, as constituents of forward movement, migrating cells need not only to adhere to the neighboringcells but periodically to detach their back; an interestingopen question is thus whether the activity of E-cadherinis polarized, such that the cell front exhibits enhanced adhesion as compared with the retracting back. Seek guidance The polarization, formation of protrusions and generation of traction represent inherent properties of germ cells andare the basis for their motility. This inherent motility is biased to become directional migration upon integrationThe nuts and bolts of germ-cell migration Tarbashevich and Raz 717 www.sciencedirect.com Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2010, 22:715 -721 COURSE BOOK PAGE 90of signals from the environment, thus enabling efcient arrival of germ cells at the gonad. The migration of PGCs, therefore, serves as a model for guided migration during normal development, with relevance for medical conditions such as cancer andinflammation, where directed cell migration plays a critical role. The metastatic destination of breast cancer cells for example, was suggested to be controlled bydirected migration of the tumor cells towards target tissues expressing the chemokine CXCL12 [ 66]. Sim- ilarly, the directional cues for germ cells dene regions that either attract or repel the migrating cells, thereby guiding them towards intermediate and nal migrationtargets. A number of different types of cues can modifythe migration path of germ cells; these include protein ligands for different receptors (bone morphogenetic fac-tor receptor, chemokine and the kit receptor tyrosine kinase. Reviewed in [ 11 /C15/C15]), lipid signaling molecules [67] and molecules that assume their attractant function following specic post-translational modications [ 68]. Despite the identication of this array of guidance cues, little is known concerning the precise mechanism by which they direct cell migration. A conceivable possibility is that polarized activation of the receptor leads to a localenhancement of the basal motility pathway, thus con- verting random migration into a directed one ( Figure 1 ).718 Cell differentiation Figure 1 (a) (b) z xy z Current Opinion in Cell Biology Hypothetical model for basic and guided motility based on zebrafish PGCs. The motility of the germ cells could be supported by positive feedback loops. In such circuits, elements x, y, z represent relevant molecules involved in adhesion, myosin activation, membrane -cytoskeleton interaction, small Rho GTPases activation, and so on. In the absence of a chemotactic gradient (a)stochastic, chemotactic-signal independent increased activation of such a loop at a certain position would result in protrusion formation at that location. If effective adhesion and formation of additionalblebs is more likely to happen in a region where a bleb formed before (e.g. due reduced adhesion between the newly formed cortex with the newlyexpanded membrane of the bleb), a leading edge could be established, resulting in migration in a certain direction. Such periods of active migration areinterrupted by de-polarization (tumbling), re-sensing of the environment and re-acquisition of the polarity in the random direction. In the presence of aguidance-cue gradient (b), persistent feedback loops are more likely to be generated at the site of higher receptor activation (red arrowhead), that corresponds to the aspect of the cell exposed to higher chemoattractant level. Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2010, 22:715 -721 www.sciencedirect.com COURSE BOOK PAGE 91Indeed, triggering the relevant guidance receptors by ligand binding (e.g. in the case of the c-Kit, CXCR4 or Tre-1) was shown to result in activation of signalingtransduction pathways involving PI3K, Rac1, RhoA, ERK, Calcium, PLC and MAPK. These molecules that serve as constituents of the motility machinery andacquisition of cell polarity also function in the context of directed migration. For example, the activity of PI3K is necessary for proper migration of mouse and zebrashPGCs [ 47,55 ], as are RhoA and Rac1 PGCs [26 /C15/C15,45] and elevated Calcium levels at the leading edge of migrating zebrash germ cells [ 41]. According to this view, stochastic cell-autonomous polarization and moti-lity circuits result in non-directional migration, whereasreceptor activation acts on the same signaling pathways, while providing dominant spatial information; this spatial information localizes the activation of pathway com-ponents that in turn establish a persistent leading edge, thus steering the cells to migrate along a vector dictated by the distribution of the guidance cue ( Figure 1).

Nevertheless, the control over basic cellular mechanisms directing cells into motile behavior in vivo is largely unknown.Here, we report on the identication of a minimalset of parameters the regulation of which confersproper morphology and cell motility. Zebrashprimordial germ cells rendered immotile by knock-down of Dead end, a negative regulator of miRNAfunction, were used as a platform for identifying processes restoring motility. We have dened myosin contractility, cell adhesion, and cortex prop-erties as factors whose proper regulation is sufcientfor restoring cell migration of this cell type. Tightcontrol over the level of these cellular features,achieved through a balance between miRNA-430function and the action of the RNA-binding proteinDead end, effectively transforms immotile primordial germ cells into polarized cells that actively migrate relative to cells in their environment. INTRODUCTION Cell migration is a critical process that is involved in gastrulation, the generation of organs, and in the maintenance and function of the organs. This process is also key to normal and abnormal immune responses and constitutes the basis for a range ofpathological conditions ( Borregaard, 2010 ;Friedl 2009 ;Roussos et al., 2011 ;Solnica-Krezel, 2005 ). A fundamental issue in cell migration concerns the actual acquisition of cell motility, theability of cells to change their position relative to neighboring cells. Determining the mechanisms controlling cell motility would thus contribute to the understanding of a range of events innormal development, homeostasis, and disease. A useful model for studying single-cell migration in vivo is that of primordial germ cells (PGCs) in early zebrash embryos ( Raz,2004 ). The zebrash PGCs toward their target, the chemokine Cxcl12a, and the mechanisms controlling its distribution have been identied ( Boldajipour et al., 2008 ;Doitsi- dou et al., 2002 ). Furthermore, the processes contributing to cell motility have been extensively studied. These studies showedthat zebrash PGCs generate protrusions in the form of actin- free cellular extensions powered by hydrostatic pressure ( Blaser et al., 2006 ), while generation of traction that allows the cells to move with respect to neighboring cells requires the function of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin ( Kardash et al., 2010 ). Whereas those processes appear to be important for efcient PGC migration, it is not clear whether they are sufcientfor promoting cell motility. Furthermore, the understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating these cellular features iscurrently lacking. A protein whose function is especially important in this context is the RNA-binding protein Dead end (Dnd) ( Weidinger et al., 2003 ). This protein was found to function, at least in part, by counteracting the action of microRNAs (miRNAs), facilitating the stabilization and translation of specic mRNAs ( Kedde et al., 2007 ). Interestingly, Dnd was shown to be essential for PGC motility, as cells knocked down for its activity displaystriking morphological defects, such that they fail to generate protrusions and to migrate ( Weidinger et al., 2003 ). These immo- tile PGCs thus constitute an attractive platform for dening the fundamental processes controlling the acquisition of cell motility in vivo. In this work, we show that the morphology and the motility of the germ cells rely on the proper regulation of contractility, aswell as of cell adhesion and on the control over cortex-membrane interaction. Specically, we demonstrate that cellslacking Dnd exhibit reduced contractile activity on one hand and elevated levels of Annexin A5b, a scaffold calcium- and phospholipid-binding protein that could control membrane-cortex interaction on the other. In addition, in the absence of Dnd, expression levels of the transcriptional repressor Zeb1 are reduced, resulting in elevated levels of the cell adhesionmolecule E-cadherin. Consistent with the idea that contractility, adhesion level, and cortex-membrane interaction constitute key elements in the cellular motility program, manipulation ofthese determinants was sufcient to direct cells toward motile 210 Developmental Cell 23, 210-218, July 17, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. COURSE BOOK PAGE 95behavior. Specically, enhancing the contractility in PGCs knocked down for Dnd, coupled to controlling the level of cell-cell adhesion and cortex properties, results in a striking recovery of protrusion generation and migration. Together, these ndings dene a set of cellular events that in concert potentiate single-cell motility in vivo and uncover the molecular mechanismscontrolling them, namely, a balance between miRNA function and the action of a cell-specic RNA-binding protein. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The Generation of Hydrostatic Pressure-Powered Protrusions in PGCs Depends on Dnd ( section, available online) ( Blaser et al., 2006 ). This cellular behavior depends on the function of the RNA-binding protein Dnd, as cells lacking itexhibit simple, round morphology are immotile ( andMovie right section) ( Weidinger et al., 2003 ). Previous analysis of the protrusions generated by PGCs re- vealed that they are powered by hydrostatic pressure thatpushes the membrane away from the actin cortex of the cell(Blaser et al., 2006 ). These protrusions, termed blebs, are produced by a range of other cell types (reviewed in Fackler and Grosse, 2008 ) and are nucleated at a point around the cell Figure 1.

Remarkably, a similartreatment of PGCs knocked down for Dndfunction never resulted in bleb formation ( Fig- ure 1 D and Movie S2 , second section, no bleb induction in 48 attempts in 29 cells). Increasingthe laser power resulted in a complete rupture of the cell ( Movie S2 , second section). These results are con- sistent with the idea that unlike wild-type cells, where intra-cellular pressure inflates the bleb, Dnd-depleted cells do notproduce sufcient pressure for pushing the membrane away from the damaged cortex. Indeed, the simple round morphology of the Dnd knocked down PGCs is highly reminiscent of thatobserved in cells in which myosin contractility is inhibited ( Blaser et al., 2006 ). To test this supposition, we introduced myosin light chain kinase (MLCK, referred to as MYLKa in zebrash) intothese cells, effectively restoring their ability to form blebs, in particular in response to laser-mediated damage to the cortex (Figure 1 E and Movie S2 , third section, induction of blebs in 24 out of 29 trials in 18 cells). Along these lines, overexpression ofROCK2a or RhoA, other activators of myosin contractility led to similar results (data not shown). Together, these experiments show that increasing myosin contractility, a feature connected toenhanced intracellular pressure ( Charras al., 2005 ;Sedzinski et al., 2011 ), is sufcient for restoring bleb formation in PGCs depleted of Dnd function. These observations are consistentwith the notion that contractility-dependent hydrostatic pressure is at the basis of the characteristic morphology of wild-type motile PGCs. PGCs thus offer a useful model for exploring thegenetic regulation over cellular hydrostatic pressure, a processof general importance in the control of cell shape and behavior (Charras et al., 2005 ;Stewart et al., 2011 ).Developmental Cell Reprogramming Cell Motility Developmental Cell 23, 210-218, July 17, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. 211 COURSE BOOK PAGE 96Figure 2.

COURSE BOOK PAGE 97MicroRNAs Control MLCK Expression Levels As the Dnd protein was shown to counteract miRNA function (Kedde et al., 2007 ), we set out to examine the possibility that the level of proteins controlling myosin contractility is regulated by miRNAs and Dnd. We found that whereas rhoA lacks canonical seed sequences indicative of miRNA regulation, such elements are found in the3 0untranslated regions (UTRs) of rock2a and mlck. To deter- mine whether these mRNAs are subjected to miRNA regulation, we employed RNA reporters containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) open reading frame (ORF) fused to the 30UTR of the mlck orrock2a RNA (or to that of the nanos RNA as an miRNA-responsive control) and injected it into 1-cell stagewild-type or MZ dicer mutant embryos that are devoid of mature miRNAs ( Giraldez et al., 2005 ). Quantitative pixel-inten- sity analysis revealed dramatically elevated GFP level insomatic cells of 16 hr postfertilization (hpf) MZ dicer embryos as compared to wild-type control embryos in the case of mlck , but not for rock2a (Figures 2 A,S1A, and S1B; data not shown). Thus, as previously shown for the nanos 3 0UTR ( Mishima et al., 2006 of mlck could potentially confer nega- tive regulation on the translation of linked ORFs through the action of miRNAs. Consistently, quantitative PCR (qPCR) per- formed on RNA extracted from MZ dicer and wild-type embryos revealed highly signicant elevation in the endogenous levels of both mlck and nanos in embryos lacking mature miRNAs ( Fig- ure 2 B). Interestingly, whereas cis-elements located within the mlck 30UTR lead to a reduction in mlck RNA levels and repressed GFP expression in somatic cells, the mlck 30UTR- containing RNA directed strong GFP expression to the PGCs (Figure S1 C, inset). Indeed, we found that mlck RNA possesses miRNA-430 binding sites in its 30UTR ( Figure 2 C), prompting us to assess the role of this miRNA in controlling MLCK level and in acquiringproper cell morphology and attaining motility. We analyzed the function of the three seed sequences for miR-430 ( Figure 2 C, blue boxes) by introducing point mutations within the seed sequences ( Figure 2 C, red boxes), or by application of ''target protector'' morpholinos (TP) ( Figure 2 C,TP1,TP2,TP3)(Choi et al., 2007 ). Both manipulations led to a strong increase in GFP expression, similar to that observed in MZdicer embryos (Figures 2 D, 2E, and S1C-1F). These results further substantiate the notion that mlck RNA is inhibited by miR-430 in the soma of embryos. Binding of Dnd to mlck mRNA Alleviates miRNA- Mediated Repression in Primordial Germ Cells The results presented above indicate that MLCK expression and thus MLCK-dependent contractility is repressed in somatic cells by miRNAs. However, in the PGCs this repression was not effec-tive ( Figure S1 C, inset), suggesting that miRNA activity on the 3 0 UTR of mlck is alleviated in these cells. An attractive candidate to counteract the action of miRNAs in the PGCs is the Dnd proteinthat exerts such an effect on RNAs like those encoding forNanos and Tdrd7 ( Kedde et al., 2007 ), proteins that are essential for germline development ( Lehmann and Nu \u00a8sslein-Volhard, 1991 ). Indeed, Dnd function in the PGCs was essential for the ex- pression of a fluorescent reporter whose ORF was fused to the wild-type 3 0UTR of the mlck RNA ( Figures Impor- 30UTR was Figures ings the miR-430-mediatedrepression over mlck 3 0UTR in PGCs, explaining at least in part the enhanced contractility and dynamic cell-shape changes required for the motility of these cells. In agreement with this assertion, is the presence of Uridine-rich regions (URRs) withinthe 3 0UTR of mlck, Dnd shown to interact ( Kedde et al., 2007 ) and which reside in close proximity to miRNA seed 1 ( Figure 2 F, violet boxes). As shown in Figures 2G and 2H, mutating these URRs resulted in a dramatic reduc- tion in the level of the CFP reporter (CFP whose ORF was fused to this 30UTR). Consistent with such a direct role for Dnd in controlling the function of mlck RNA, we could demonstrate a specic interaction of Dnd with mlck RNA ( Figures 2 I and S1I). Together, these ndings suggest that Dnd counteracts miR-430-mediated repression in PGCs by binding to URRs located within the mlck 30UTR, thereby controlling the cellular features relevant for bleb-associated motility. Increasing MLCKlevel in Dnd knocked-down cells restores bleb butnot motility. We therefore sought to identify additional moleculesthe function of which, in concert with that of MLCK would support active migration of the cells. Regulation of Cell Adhesion by Dnd-Mediated Control of Zeb1 Expression In addition to actomyosin contractility, the motility of zebrashPGCs requires surroundingcells E-cadherin ( Kardash et al., 2010 ). Interestingly, PGCs knocked down for Dnd, show elevated levels of E-cad-herin, relative to those detected in migrating wild-type PGCs atthe same developmental stage ( Blaser et al., 2005 ). In addition, a slight reduction in E-cadherin level in wild-type PGCs precedesthe acquisition of motility and is thought to allow the detachmentof PGCs from neighboring cells, while maintaining sufcient level of the molecule compatible with the generation of traction (Blaser et al., 2005 ). In other cell types, E-cadherin was shown to be regulated at the transcriptional level as well as at the level of protein activity and localization (Ahn et al., 2011 ;Jeanes et al., 2008 ;Ma\u00b4laga-Trillo et al., 2009 ;Ulrich et al., 2005 ).

Relevant for this study, it was shown that Zeb1 expression is regulated by miRNAs in various cell types ( Brabletz and Brabletz, 2010 ). We examined the miRNA regulation of Zeb1 expression in zebrash by monitoring wild-type and MZ dicer embryos for 1. The fluores- cent intensity of a GFP reporter construct containing zeb1 30 UTR and 2. The endogenous zeb1 mRNA level. Indeed, both parameters reveal that miRNAs interfere with Zeb1 expression,as a signicant increase in GFP and zeb1 mRNA level was observed in embryos lacking mature miRNAs ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and S2A). Consistent with these results, is the presence of a Figure 3. Control of ZEB1 and Annexin A5b Expression by miRNAs and Dnd (A) Lack of miRNAs in MZ dicer embryos results in higher GFP signal from a reporter containing the 30UTR of zeb1, measured at 16 hpf from the line marked areas (Figure S2 A).

Error bars depict the SEM and***p < 0.001, calculated using two-tailed, unpaired t test.See the zeb1 30UTR ( Fig- ure 3 C, blue box). To determine the relevance of this seed sequence for miRNA regulation, we examined the activity of reporter constructs in which the seed was mutated ( Figure 3 C, red box), or blocked by TP morpholinos ( Figure 3 C, TP). Both manipulations resulted in a strong increase in GFP level from the reporter construct(Figures 3 D, 3E, and S2B), proving that miR-430 family members target zeb1 3 0UTR. The miRNA-mediated regulation of Zeb1 in somatic cells could account for the higher level of E-cadherin detected in these cells, as compared to that observed in motile PGCs.We sought to determine whether in analogy to the control over contractility, Dnd protein is involved incontrolling E-cadherin level in PGCs by regulating the expressionlevels of its repressor, Zeb1. In agreement with this notion, we found that the expression level of the reporter protein, whose ORF was fused to the 3 0UTR of zeb1 , depended on Dnd expres- sion in the PGCs (Venus in Figures 3 F and 3G). Furthermore, the role of Dnd here is to counteract the action of miRNAs on the 30 UTR of zeb1 , since mutating the miR-430 seed rendered the reporter RNA insensitive to the lack of Dnd (CFP in Figures 3 F and 3G). These results can be explained by the binding of Dndprotein to zeb1 mRNA, as demonstrated in Figures 2 I and S1I. Together, these ndings suggest that Dnd functions in thePGCs to inhibit microRNA function on the mRNA encoding the transcriptional repressor Zeb1. This action of Dnd could in turnDevelopmental Cell Reprogramming Cell Motility 214 Developmental Cell 23, 210-218, July 17, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. COURSE BOOK PAGE 99reduce the level of E-cadherin in the PGCs, thereby promoting their motility. Accordingly, overexpression of Zeb1 resulted in overall lower E-cadherin protein levels in zebrash embryos ( Fig- ure S2 C). These results thus suggest that Dnd functions in regu- lating the adhesion level of the PGCs to cells in their environ-ment, thereby promoting their motility of calcium- and phospho- lipid-binding proteins that have been implicated in a wide spec- trum of cellular processes ( Gerke and Moss, 2002 ;Rescher and Gerke, 2004 ). Included in these processes, Annexins are thought to control membrane to cortex attachment ( Babiychuk et al., 1999 ;Bouter et al., 2011 ), a parameter considered to negatively regulate bleb formation ( Diz-Mun oz et al., 2010 ;Lorentzen et al., 2011 ). Consistently, a dramatic increase in the mRNA encoding for Annexin A5b is observed in Dnd morphant PGCs, cells that do not bleb ( Figure 3 H). The increase in annexin A5b RNA levels indndmorpholino-treated PGCs could be indirect and presum- ably miRNA independent. Irrespective of the mode by which Dnd controls Annexin A5b expression, we examined whether this scaffold protein could contribute to the lack of blebs in immotileDnd knocked-down cells. Interestingly, downregulation of embryos effectively restored bleb formation in PGCs ( Figures S3 A and S3B; S3 4. treated PGCs (green) are immotile with respect to somatic cells (red).

Asterisks mark a stationary reference point in the soma.Arrowheads point at bleb formation positions. Arrowsindicate direction of movement.See also Figure S3 S4 these results suggest that contribute to the Dnd knockdown phenotype and thus consti-tutes one of the components responsible for the rounded shape of these cells and their inability to move. Reprogramming Bleb-Based Single-Cell Motility of PGCs We have cellular propertiesthat are differentially controlled in somatic and germ cells and showed that they are required for the acquisitionof proper cellular morphology and motility. The importanceof regulating these features in somatic cells is revealed by the fact that relieving mlck RNA from miRNA regulation A5b (Figure S2 F) lead to defects in gastrulation. In the germ cells, manipulations of hydrostatic pressure, cell-cell adhesion, and cortex-membrane interaction affected the morphology of Dndknocked-down cells, but individually were insufcient to restore motility. As cell movement involves the integration of several physical cellular properties, we next examined whether a combi-nation of these could restore the motility of PGCs compromised for Dnd function. by counteract- miR-430 RNA. Indeed, increasing the contractility by reintroducing MLCK, effectively restored bleb cells nevertheless, re-mained immotile ( Figures 4 A and 4B; Movie S4 rst and second section). Further, by regulating Zeb1 level, Dnd also acts to reduce cell-cell adhesion to a level compatible with single-cell motility in the embryo. Last, Dnd function is important forcontrolling the cell cortex properties by maintaining low levels of Annexin A5b. In this case too, Dnd knocked-down PGCs in which the level of Annexin A5b was lowered exhibit dynamicalteration in cell morphology and formation of blebs, but remain immotile ( Figure S3 B;Movie S3 ).Developmental Cell Reprogramming Cell Motility Developmental Cell 23, 210-218, July 17, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. 215 COURSE BOOK PAGE 100These results thus correlate three cellular features, namely, myosin-mediated contractility, cell adhesion, and cell cortex- membrane interaction, with the ability to acquire proper cellular morphology and motility. We next investigated whether thecombination of these components is sufcient for conferring single-cell motility in PGCs knocked down for Dnd function. As a rst step, we examined the effect of reducing cell adhesioncombined with increased contractility in PGCs knocked downfor Dnd. To this end, we expressed moderate levels of MLCK (lower than those restoring bleb formation), as well as of a dominant-negative form of E-cadherin (Ecdh DEC1-2) in the PGCs, and observed a modest rescue of the Dnd phenotype; similar to the example shown in Figure 4 C and Movie S4 , third section, out of 60 cells examined in 30 embryos, over 80% of Dnd knocked-down cells that otherwise exhibited simple static morphology and were completely immotile showed polarization and limited movement relative to their neighbors.Moreover, providing such partially rescued PGCs with morpho-lino against annexin A5b, further enhanced their protrusive (by 2.6-fold, and by 1.7-fold when only blebs formedat the direction of cell movement were considered), as well astheir motility relative to neighboring somatic cells ( Figure 4 D; Movie S4 , fourth section). The results presented above demonstrate that modulating three cellular parameters by a combination of RNAs and anti- sense oligonucleotides is sufcient for transforming immotile cells into cells that actively migrate. Subsequently, we soughtto perform reprogramming of cellular motility by altering the activity of a small set of transcripts endogenously expressed in the PGCs. For this purpose, we used a mixture of targetprotectors that counteract the miR-430 function annexin A5b MO). In addition, we included morpholinos inhibiting p53 translation inthe mixture to inhibit cell death resulting from loss of RNAs such as nanos in PGCs lacking Dnd function ( Robu et al., 2007 ), thus allowing us to focus on the role of Dnd in PGC motility ( Figure 4 E). Remarkably, out of 60 PGCs treated in this way in 25 different embryos, over 80% showed protrusive behavior and 40% actively migrated ( Figures 4 E and 4F; Movie S5, rst and second section). Despite the dramatic reversion of the Dnd motility phenotype, the migration of the rescued PGCs that lack the expression of proteins responsible for PGC identity was slower than that wild-type cells exhibit, pro-hibiting them from effectively reaching their target. Germ cells differ from somatic cells with respect to the regulation over actin-based structures relevant for migration, in their abilityto respond to specic guidance cues and the modes of cell adhesion that govern their motility. Interestingly, despite these differences, employing the ''PGC-motility module'' on somaticcells resulted in enhanced cell-shape changes and protrusive activity, while actual motility was not observed ( Figures S3 C and S3D; Movie S5 , third and fourth sections). The lack of full migration of somatic cells provided with the PGC-motility module highlights the relevance of the initial state of the cell with respect to this property. This phenomenon is analogous to that observed in reprogramming cell fate, where the initialcellular state determines the response of cells to the relevant manipulations ( Hanna et al., 2010 ).In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a proper regulation of three biophysical parameters is sufcient to reverse theimmotile state cell-shape changes and protrusiveactivity, characteristic of motile single cells, also in cells that normally do not show this behavior. The identication of this set of requirements for single-cell motility is relevant for pro-cesses in normal development when cells delaminate fromtheir tissue of origin, as well as in disease conditions ( Baum et al., 2008 ;Clay and Halloran, 2011 ). For example, gene ex- pression proles of cancer cells revealed upregulation of RNAsencoding for proteins controlling contractility, coinciding with downregulation genes controlling cell to al., 2006 , and GDS1965 in Hoek et al., 2004 ).Studying the biophysical aspects governing PGC motility and the regulation of these cellular prop- erties is thus likely to shed light on a range of processes wheresingle-cell migration is involved. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Zebrash Strains Zebrash (Danio rerio ) of the AB transgenic sh carrying the Tol-kop-egfp-f-nanos -30UTR transgene (Blaser et al., 2005 ) were used as wild-type sh.

COURSE BOOK PAGE 1031939 Summary In most tissues, the precise control of cell migration and cell- cell interaction is of paramount importance to thedevelopment of a functional structure. Several families ofsecreted molecules have been implicated in regulating theseaspects of development, including the Slits and their Roboreceptors. These proteins have well described roles in axonguidance but by influencing cell polarity and adhesion, theyparticipate in many developmental processes in diverse celltypes. We review recent progress in understanding both themolecular mechanisms that modulate Slit/Robo expression andtheir functions in neural and non-neural tissue. Key words: Axon guidance, Cell migration, Cell-cell interaction Introduction In most organisms, the central nervous system (CNS) developsalong a bilateral axis of symmetry located at the midline (Placzekand Briscoe, 2005). During development, the ventral midline orfloor plate acts as an organiser through the secretion of diffusibleproteins (Placzek and Briscoe, 2005; Gore et al., 2008), whichcontrol the growth of axons and dendrites and the migration ofneurons across the glial or neuronal cellsdelineate the midline (see Glossary, Box 1) and also control axonguidance. For more than two decades, many developmentalneurobiologists have tried to understand the mechanisms thatcontrol midline crossing in the CNS and to answer some keyquestions. Firstly, how are commissural axons (see Glossary, Box1) attracted to the midline and how do their growth cones (seeGlossary, Box1) receive and integrate the multiple and contrastingsignals released by midline cells? Secondly, what are the molecularand signalling changes that enable commissural axons to leave themidline and often to switch to a longitudinal growth mode? Allmidline-derived axon guidance factors are expressed at otherlocations in many developing and mature tissues, where theycontrol a wide range of biological processes. Roundabout receptors (Robo) and their Slit ligands form one of the most crucial ligand-receptor pairings among the axon guidancemolecules. Robos were identified in Drosophila in a mutant screen for genes that control the midline crossing of commissural axons(Kidd et al., 1998; Seeger et al., 1993). Similarly, Slit wasdiscovered in Drosophila as a protein secreted by midline 1988; Rothberg et al., 1990). Homologues of bothproteins have since been discovered in many species (for a review,see Ch\u00e9dotal, 2007). However, the Slit/Robo couple not onlyfunctions in axon guidance but also in a variety of developmentalDevelopment 137, 1939-1952 (2010) doi:10.1242/dev.044511 \u00a9 2010.

DEVELOPMENT COURSE BOOK PAGE 1041940 processes outside of the midline and the CNS. As such, it is insightful to explore the roles of Slit/Robo in different systems andto contrast their modes of action. Moreover, in this review, wedelve into some of the mechanisms of Robo regulation andsignalling that vary tremendously from one region to another.Although we focus on recent findings discovered in vertebrates, wealso mention relevant studies in invertebrates where appropriate. Robo and Slit structure Robo receptors belong to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily ofcell adhesion (CAMs) and heterophilic interactions (Hivert most vertebrates, there are three Robo receptorsexpressed in brain cells (Ch\u00e9dotal, 2007). In zebrafish andmammals, a fourth Robo receptor, Robo4, is expressed byendothelial cells and functions in angiogenesis (Bedell et al., 2005;Jones et al., 2008); this receptor will not be discussed further here.The standard/archetypical Robo receptor contains five Ig motifs,three fibronectin type III domains and four conserved cytoplasmicdomains, expressed in different combinations within the Roboreceptor family (Fig. 1). All Robo receptors can be alternatively spliced to generate various isoforms. Alternative splicing in the 5 /H11032coding sequence can generate two distinct receptor isoforms, A and B, which differat their N-terminal end. Type A isoforms are longer (16-40residues) than type B isoforms (Camurri et al., 2005; Kidd et al.,1998; Sundaresan et al., 1998; Yue et al., 2006). In the case ofRobo3, alternative splicing by the retention or excision of oneintron in the 3/H11032 coding sequence generates two isoforms that differ in their C-terminal domain, with Robo3.1 being longer thanRobo3.2 (Chen et al., 2008a). For more information on thestructure of Robo receptors, we refer readers to a recent review byCh\u00e9dotal (Ch\u00e9dotal, 2007). Slits are the principal ligands for the Robo receptors (Kidd et al., 1999). Slit was originally discovered in Drosophila (Rothberg et al., 1988; Rothberg et al., 1990), and its homologues have sincebeen discovered in several species, including worms, teleosts andmammals (Ch\u00e9dotal, 2007). In mammals, there are three Slit genes,all of which are expressed in the nervous system and in mostorgans (Marillat et al., 2002). Slits are secreted glycoproteins thatpossess following general laminin-G domain and a C-terminal cysteine-rich knot (see Fig. 1). Slits can be cleaved toyield a short C-terminus fragment of unknown function and a longN-terminus fragment that is active and mediates binding to Robos(Nguyen Ba-Charvet et al., 2001; Wang et al., 1999). Analysis of the Slit LRR regions has demonstrated that Drosophila Robo receptors bind to a common site located within the D2 region of Slit (Howitt et al., 2004). Moreover, Robos bindREVIEW Development 137 of Slit-Robo signalling.

( B)The Rho GTPases and their regulators (GAPs and GEFs) are key components of the Slit-Robo signalling pathway. In the presence of Slit, Slit-RoboGAP1 (srGA P1) binds to the CC3 domain of Robo and inactivates RhoA and Cdc42. These effector proteins are able to mediate, among other outcomes, repulsion , control of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell polarity. ( C)In the presence of Slit, Vilse/CrossGAP can also bind to the CC2 domain of Robo and inhibit Rac1 and Cdc42. Rac1 is also activated by the recruitment of the GEF protein Son of sevenless (Sos) via the adaptor protein Dreadlocks ( Dock), which binds to the CC2-3 domain of Robo. This activates the downstream target of Rac1 and p21-activated kinase (Pak), which also binds to Robo CC2-3 domains. These downstream signalling partners of of the CC1 domain and mediates cell adhesion. Enabled (Ena) a substrate of Abl also binds Robo CC1 and CC2 domains. The slit cleavage site is also shown. DEVELOPMENT COURSE BOOK PAGE 1051941 REVIEW Development 137 (12) to Slits through their Ig1 and Ig2 domains (Liu et al., 2004). The resolution of the structure of a minimal Slit-Robo complex revealedthat the Ig1 domain of Robo1 is bound by the concave face of Slit-D2, and that the binding residues of the Slit LRR2 domain arehighly conserved among all Slits across species, as are those of theRobo Ig1 domain (Morlot et al., 2007). This conservation couldexplain the promiscuous binding of Slit ligands to Robo receptorsthat has been previously described using overlay assays (seeGlossary, Box 1) (Brose et al., 1999; Sabatier et al., 2004).Although Slit does not always bind to Robo as a dimer, heparansulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) have been interaction of heparan sulphates (HSs)with the D4 domain of Slit, which furthermore seems to potentiateSlit activity (Seiradake et al., 2009). However, Slit is not the only ligand for Robo and vice versa. In Caenorhabditis elegans , SLT-1/Slit also binds to the EV A-1 transmembrane protein that has homologues in mammals (Fujisawaet al., 2007). Likewise, biochemical and genetic data demonstratethat an interaction occurs between the LRR tendon-specific protein(LRT) and Robo, highlighting a mechanism by canmodulate Robo-Slit interactions and influence muscle cellmigration (Wayburn and V olk, 2009). Moreover, as we discussbelow, several studies have identified HSPGs as co-receptors forSlits that are necessary for Slit-Robo signalling (Hu, 2001;Steigemann et al., 2004). Recent structural analysis has revealedthat Slit/Robo form a ternary complex with a heparin/HS thatstabilises and strengthens the Slit-Robo interaction (Fukuhara et al.,2008; Hussain et al., 2006). And, as mentioned above, structuralstudies have also shown that the Slit D4 region binds HS andpromotes Slit homodimerisation (Seiradake et with heparan sulphates HSPGs are proteoglycan core proteins attached to HS chains,which are either membrane bound, like syndecans (Sdc) andglypicans, HS have a dual role: as regulators of celladhesion, as they can bind to other components in the extracellularspace; and as signalling molecules, because they can act as co-receptors (Johnson et al., 2006; Lee and Chien, 2004; Van Vactoret al., 2006). HSPGs have been implicated in Slit/Robo signalling in various studies over the years. For example, the enzymatic removal of HSalong the optic tract of developing Xenopus embryos induces guidance defects in retinal axons (Walz et al., 1997). HSPGremoval also decreases the affinity of Slit2 for Robo and abolishesthe repulsive activity of Slit2 on rat olfactory axons in vitro (Hu,2001). Slit2 also binds to (Ronca et al., 2001). Inaddition, when heparan sulphates are disrupted, Slit2 fails to repelXenopus axons (Piper et al., 2006). In zebrafish, dopaminergic axons are surrounded by HS, and their removalenhances the mis-positioning of this longitudinal tract inRobo2/astray mutants (Kastenhuber et al., 2009). In addition, the exostosin 1 ( Ext1), which encodes a glycosyltransferase involved in HSPG synthesis, induces defects at the mouse opticchiasm, which resemble those observed in Slit1/Slit2 double- knockout mice (Inatani et al., 2003; Plump et al., 2002).Furthermore, Slit and Ext1 have been shown genetically to interact(Inatani et al., 2003). In Drosophila, the transmembrane HSPG Sdc interacts with Robo and Slit, the Slit-dependentrepulsion of axons at the CNS midline (Johnson et al., 2004;Steigemann et al., 2004). The extracellular domain of Sdc can beproteolytically cleaved and shed as a soluble proteoglycan(Fitzgerald et al., 2000), which is necessary and sufficient tomediate Slit signalling in target cells (Chanana et al., 2009). Theenzymatic modification of HS is also important for Slit activity,and O-sulphation of glypican 1 significantly potentiates Slit2 binding embryonic kidney 293 cells (Ronca et al., 2001).Recent genetic data in C. elegans strongly suggest that HS O - sulphation of LON-2/glypican regulates motor axon guidance,probably by modulating to A-1, and with SAX-3/Robo (Bulow et al., 2008; Fujisawa et al.,2007). So far, HSPGs have been shown to mostly affect thefunctions of Slit/Robo in axon guidance. As discussed in thefollowing sections, other molecules also interact with Robos andSlits and their downstream effectors to influence cell migration. Slit and Robo in cell migration Repulsion and cell polarity In most developing tissues, cells migrate in a precise direction, following stereotyped pathways under the influence of repulsiveand attractive factors. In vertebrates, two main types of neuronalmigration have been described: radial migration (see Glossary, Box1) and tangential migration (see Glossary, Box 1). As discussedbelow, Slit/Robo repulsion influences tangential migration inseveral systems (Andrews et al., 2008; Metin et al., 2008). Slit/Robo function in tangential neuronal migration was first shown in the mouse forebrain, Glossary, Box 1) derived from the subventricularzone (see Glossary, Box 1), thus guiding them towards theolfactory bulb (see Glossary, Box 1) (Hu, 1999; Nguyen-Ba-Charvet et al., 2004; Sawamoto et al., 2006; Wu et al., 1999). Slit/Robo repulsion also orchestrates tangential migration in the mouse hindbrain. Hindbrain precerebellar nuclei (see Glossary,Box 1) contain neurons that project to the cerebellum. Theseneurons are born in the dorsal edges of the neuroepithelium thatlines the fourth ventricle (the so-called rhombic lip) and migratetangentially towards the floor plate under the attractive action ofnetrin 1 (see Fig. 2) (Bloch-Gallego et al., 1999; Marcos et al.,2009; Sotelo and Ch\u00e9dotal, 2005; Yee et al., 1999). Axons thatoriginate from neurons of the inferior olive (IO; see Glossary, Box1), the climbing fibers, synapse onto Purkinje precerebellar neurons, from the pontine nucleus (PN; seeGlossary, lateral cuneatus nucleus (ECN), onto granule cell dendrites. Allhindbrain precerebellar neurons migrate towards the floor plate, butwhereas the cell bodies of LRN and ECN neurons cross it, thesoma of IO neurons (IONs) and of most PN neurons stop at themidline and only their axons cross the midline (see Fig. 2D). Migrating precerebellar neurons 2004; DiMeglio et al., 2008; Geisen et al., 2008). Slits are expressed in thefloor plate, the rhombic lip and in several cranial motor nuclei,such as the facial nucleus (Geisen et al., 2008; Gilthorpe et al.,2002; Hammond et al., 2005). In vitro assays had previously shownthat Slits can repel migrating et al.,2002; et al., et al., 2002). Recent studiesof Slit and Robo mutant mice have confirmed that Slit/Robosignalling controls the migration of precerebellar neurons in vivo. In Robo1/Robo2 double knockouts and to a lesser extent in Slit1/Slit2 double knockouts, a significant proportion of the somata of IONs do not stop at the floor plate but migrate to the DEVELOPMENT COURSE BOOK PAGE 1061942 contralateral side (Fig. 2D). Thus, in these mice the olivary projection is bilateral and not exclusively contralateral, as in wild-type mice. These findings are in agreement with Slit/Robo havinga gate-keeper role at the midline, selecting neurons and axons thatare allowed to cross it. Interestingly, the migration of PN neuronsis also perturbed in these mutants but in a different way. Uponleaving the rhombic lip, PN neurons migrate rostrally acrossseveral rhombomeres a compact stream before turning ventrallytowards the midline (Geisen et al., 2008). In Robo1/Robo2 and Slit1/Slit2 double knockouts, the stream of PN neurons splits and many neurons prematurely migrate towards the floor plate (Geisenet al., 2008). In this system, the major source of Slit1 and Slit2seems to be the facial nuclei, rather than the floor plate (Geisen etal., 2008). At a subcellular level, novel data suggest that Slits control neuronal migration by influencing cell polarity. Calcium (Ca 2+) signalling and Rho GTPases are known to modulate the radialmigration of cortical neurons cerebellar granule cell/radialglia co-cultures, the focal application of Slit2 to one pole of themigrating neuron induces an elevation of intracellular Ca 2+ concentration (Xu et al., 2004), accompanied by a reversal of thedirection of migration. Although the signalling pathway activatedby Slit2 during repolarisation is still migrating rat cerebellar granule cells byinducing a local burst of Ca 2+in their leading process and soma. This Ca2+burst redistributes active RhoA from the front of the migrating granule cell to the opposite side, and reverses thedirection of migration (see below) (Guan et al., 2007). The forwardmovement of migrating cells also correlates with the positioning ofthe centrosome or microtubule organising center (MTOC) at and Gleeson, 2007). Inmigrating mouse SVZ neuroblasts in vitro, a Slit gradientinfluences cell polarity by controlling the positioning of thecentrosome (Higginbotham et al., 2006). In a breast cancer cellline, Slit also seems to primarily act upon cell motility byinfluencing centrosome movement and cell polarity (Yuasa-Kawada et al., 2009a). Slits also regulate the polarity of murineretinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons (Thompson et al., 2006). Duringdevelopment, axons extend from RGC neurons in a highlypolarised fashion, projecting radially towards the optic disc. InSlit1/Slit2 double-knockout mice, as well as in Robo2 knockout mice, the initial polarity of RGC axons is abnormal with manyaxons forming loops in the retina (Thompson et al., 2009;Thompson et al., 2006). Cytoskeletal dynamics The cytoplasmic domains of Robo receptors do not possessautonomous catalytic activities and they must therefore interactwith different signalling molecules to exert their specific effects,such as controlling cytoskeletal rearrangements (for reviews, seeCh\u00e9dotal, 2007; O'Donnell et al., 2009). Robo signalling ismediated by a range of secondary molecules and/or co-receptors,such as the netrin 1 receptor Dcc, which binds to the Robo1 CC1domain (Stein and Tessier-Lavigne, 2001) (see Box 2). Small GTPases of the Rho family (Heasman and Ridley, 2008), such as RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42, are key regulators of actincytoskeletal dynamics. These proteins switch from an inactiveGDP-bound state to an active GTP-bound state and are regulatedby the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and the guaninenucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs). Downstream of Roboreceptors, GAP proteins, such as CrossGAP/Vilse (Hu et al., 2005;Lundstrom et al., 2004) and Slit-RoboGAPs (srGAPs), controlcytoskeletal dynamics (Wong et al., 2001), as do GEF proteins likeREVIEW Development 137 (12) (b) Robo3 Robo1/2 null Slit1/2/3 null (a) Wild type Inferior olive (b) Robo1/2 null (c) Robo1/2/3 null Robo3 nullA C D B Fig. 2.

DEVELOPMENT COURSE BOOK PAGE 1071943 REVIEW Development 137 (12) Son of sevenless (Sos) (Yang and Bashaw, 2006) (see Fig. 1). Slit- Robo GAP1, 2 and 3 (srGAP1, 2 and 3) were identified in a yeasttwo-hybrid screen for binding partners of the CC3 domain ofRobo1 (Wong et al., 2001). These proteins contain a GAP domain,a SH3 domain (which binds the proline-rich region of Fes/CIP4 (FCH) al., 2001; Li et al.,2006). SrGAPs are widely expressed in the mouse nervous system(Bacon et al., 2009; Endris et al., 2002; Guerrier 2009;Madura et al., 2004; Waltereit et al., 2008; Yao et al., 2008), andbind to WASP/WA VE proteins, which are involved in actinreorganisation (Soderling et al., 2007; Wong et al., 2001). SrGAP1mediates the repulsive effect of Slit on migrating subventricularzone-derived neural progenitors, through its GAP domain, byinactivating Cdc42 and RhoA but not Rac1 (Wong et al., Bycontrast, SrGAP3 (also known as MEGAP and WRP), mutationsin which have been associated with severe mental retardation inhumans (Endris et al., 2002) (see also Hamdan et al., 2009),regulates Rac activity and plays a role in neuronal morphogenesis,synaptic plasticity and cell migration (Endris al., 2002; Soderling et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2006). A recentstudy showed that srGAP2, through its F-BAR (Fes-Cip4-Bin/Amphiphysin/Rsv) domain, is a key regulator ofneuronal migration (Guerrier et al., 2009). SrGAP2 promotesneurite extension and branching during mouse corticaldevelopment in vivo by generating outward protrusions of theneuronal membrane, thereby inhibiting neuronal migration asobserved in vitro in cortical slices. However, it will be importantto determine to what extent srGAP functions are associated withSlit/Robo signalling.Regulation of cell adhesion Increasing and recent evidence suggests that Slit and Roboare important regulators of cell adhesion, especially duringmigration. Neural crest cells (NCCs) and tube and epibranchial ectoderm, respectively, migratealong precise pathways in the embryo to generate a variety ofstructures, such as sensory ganglia and parts of the cardiovascularsystem (Shiau et al., 2008; Stoller and Epstein, 2005). It had beenreported that Slits influence the motility and patterning of NCCs,through a classic repulsive mechanism (De Bellard et al., 2003).Therefore, Slit2 appears to prevent Robo1-expressing trunk NCCsfrom entering the gut region (De Bellard et al., 2003) and mightrepel them from the dorsal part of the embryo (Jia et al., 2005).Robo1/Slit2 signalling could also control the migration of cardiacNCCs, as suggested by the fact that Robo1 is expressed in the NCClineage and by the fact that Slit2 is selectively downregulated inmice deficient for the T-box transcription Tbx1. Slit is alsodownregulated in Gbx2 (gastrulation brain homeobox 2) knockout mice, and Tbx1 and Gbx2 control cardiac NCC migrationduring fourth formation et cranial ganglia, such as the trigeminal ganglion, havea mixed origin, containing both placodal cells and NCCs. It wasrecently shown that during gangliogenesis cross talk occursbetween these two cell populations, and that secreted byNCCs, promotes the aggregation of Robo2-expressing molecule N-cadherin, placodal cells (Shiau and Bronner-Fraser, 2009).N-cadherin is expressed at the surface of placodal cells, and theaggregation of these cells increases upon Slit1 binding to Robo2,although the exact molecular mechanism is unknown (Shiau andBronner-Fraser, 2009). A similar process could participate in thedevelopment of several neuronal cell types, including precerebellarneurons and cerebellar granule cells, which express Robo2, and themigration of which requires N-cadherin (Rieger et al., 2009;Taniguchi et al., 2006). In vitro studies had previously linked Slit/Robo signalling to N- cadherin and cell adhesion (Rhee et al., 2007; Rhee et al., 2002).These studies reported that the activation of Robo2 by Slit triggersthe formation of a quaternary complex, consisting the phosphorylation of -catenin from N-cadherin to result in the inhibition of cell adhesion. In breast cancer cells, Slit2 overexpressionincreases proteasomal degradation of -catenin, but also seems to facilitate/promote its association with E-cadherin (Prasad et al.,2008). Although these studies link Slit/Robo signalling to celladhesion, this can cause either inhibition or enhancement of celladhesion depending on the system, and, possibly, on the presenceof co-receptors. An anti-adhesive activity of Slit/Robo signalling has also been reported to function during cardiac tube formation in Drosophila (Qian et al., 2005; Santiago-Martinez et al., 2006). In this system,the cardiac lumen forms after the preferential attachment of thedorsal and ventral edges of pairs of cardioblasts, which are alignedin two symmetrical rows along the dorsal midline. It waspreviously shown that the migration and alignment of cardiac cellsis regulated by Slit/Robo repulsion (Qian et al., 2005; Santiago-Martinez et al., 2006; Zmojdzian et al., 2008). More importantly,the lack of contact between the membrane of bilateral pairs ofcardioblasts at the lumenal surface involves Slit/Robo signalling,Box 2. The netrin/Dcc axon guidance signalling pathwayNetrins are a family of extracellular guidance molecules that sharesequence homology with laminin and that control axon guidanceand cell migration. Netrin is also involved in other functional roles,such as tissue morphogenesis, vascular development, cancer andcell survival (Rajasekharan and Kennedy, 2009). In vertebrates, thenetrins consist of three secreted proteins, netrin 1, function either achemoattractant or a chemorepellent. This dual activity isdependent upon the presence of distinct receptors, cell types andcellular context. Netrin 1 produces attractive effects via receptors ofthe deleted in colorectal cancer (Dcc) family, which includes thevertebrate-associated Dcc (Keino-Masu etal., 1996), the C. elegans receptor UNC-40 (Chan et al., 1996) and the Frazzled protein of Drosophila (Kolodziej et al., 1996). Netrin 1 mediates repulsive effects through UNC-5 receptors alone or incombination with Dcc (Hong et al., 1999; Keleman and Dickson,2001). Recently, the Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule(Dscam) has been also identified as a netrin 1 receptor (Ly et al.,2008). Netrins signal via several different transduction pathways,including the T-cells which contributes to thereorganisation of the cytoskeleton (Barallobre et al., 2005).Although the mechanism remains unclear, Netrin/Dcc activity canalso be influenced by the Slit/Robo signalling pathway through thedirect interaction of their intracellular domains, which results in theinhibition of netrin attraction (Stein and Tessier-Lavigne, 2001). DEVELOPMENT COURSE BOOK PAGE 1081944 which, via an autocrine or paracrine action, leads to the selected inhibition of adhesion in this central/luminal Santiago-Martinez et al., 2008). Invertebrates, Slit/Robo function was also proposed to contribute tothe development of the cardiovascular system (Calmont et al.,2009; Liu et al., 2003), although it is still unknown whether thisinvolves a classic, repulsive, mechanism or cadherin-dependent celladhesion. Although, Robo receptors share many structural features and molecular partners, mounting evidence suggests that distinct Roboreceptors exert some unique functions. Vertebrate Robo3 providesthe best example. Robo3: the black the Robo family?Vertebrate Robo3 differs from other Robo receptors for severalreasons. First, Robo3 shows greater structural heterogeneity; itpossesses at least four splice variants and possibly a secretedform (Chen et al., 2008b; Yuan et al., 1999), and in mammals itlacks the CC1 domain (Yuan et al., 1999). Second, mammalianRobo3 has only been detected in the nervous system (Barber etal., 2009; Jen et al., 2004; Marillat et al., 2004; Sabatier et al.,2004). Third, its ability to bind Slits is debated (Camurri et al.,2005; Mambetisaeva et al., 2005), and there is to date nobiological response associated with the direct binding of Slit toRobo3. Last, although it primarily controls axon guidance at themidline, Robo3 function is unusual when compared with thefunctions of the other Robos (Fig. 2). In the developing spinal cord and hindbrain, Robo3 is expressed at high levels on commissural axons until they have crossed thefloor plate Sabatier et al., In Robo3 mice, most commissural axons fail to cross the midline and neuronal migration across the floor plateis prevented al., 2004; Sabatier et al., 2004; Tamada etal., 2008) (see Fig. 2C). These findings have led to a model inwhich, before midline crossing, the presence with Slit/Robo repulsion, allowingcommissural axons and neurons to progress towards the ventralmidline under the action of chemoattractants, such as netrin 1 (Fig.2A-C). After crossing, Robo3 expression is downregulated,allowing the activation of Robo1 and Robo2 by Slit, which triggersaxon repulsion. This model is further supported by the fact thatthere is axon stalling and errors at the midline in Slit and Robomutants (Chen et al., 2008b; Long et al., 2004). In addition,crossing is 'partially' restored for commissural axons of knockouts Robo3 triple knockouts (Chen et al., 2008b; Sabatier et al., 2004). Likewise, the migration of LRN neurons across the midline is alsorescued when Robo1 and Robo2 are deleted in a Robo3 null background (Di Meglio et al., 2008). Interestingly, in cordcommissural axons, two splice variants axons (Chen et al.,2008b). Robo3.1 is expressed before crossing and seems to inhibitRobo1/Robo2 repulsion, whereas Robo3.2 is expressed aftermidline crossing and appears to cooperate with Robo1 and Robo2to repel commissural axons away from the floor plate (see Fig. 2A).However, the mechanism by which Robo3 blocks Slit/Robosignalling is still unknown (Chen et al., 2008b; Sabatier et al.,2004). In addition, the axons of IONs are still unable to cross themidline in Robo1/Robo2/Robo3 triple knockouts (Di Meglio et al., 2008), indicating that in this system Robo3 functions independentlyof other Robos (Fig. 2). An alternative model supports achemoattractive function for Robo3 in commissural axons ratherthan (Sabatier model,in the absence of Robo3, commissural axons would fail to beattracted to the floor plate. Although it is expressed in the forebrain, the function of Robo3 in this region remains mysterious as the main forebraincommissures develop normally in mice and humans deficient forRobo3 (Haller et al., 2008; Jen et al., 2004; Marillat et al., 2004; Renier et al., 2010). To date, the only evidence that Robo3possesses any function in this region comes from a study of corticalinterneuron migration (Barber et al., 2009). In Robo3 null mice, but not in Robo1 or Robo2 nulls, fewer cortical interneurons are present in the marginal zone of the early cortex, a region in whichSlit1 and Slit3 are strongly expressed, indicating that the absenceof Robo3 decreases Slit repulsion and allows some neurons to enterthe marginal zone. By contrast, forebrain commissures aredisorganised in Slit1/Slit2 and Robo1/Robo2 simple and et al., 2006; Bagri et al., 2002; Lopez-Benditoet al., 2007). This suggests that, in mammals, Robo3-independentmolecular mechanisms regulate Slit/Robo function, at least in somecommissural axons. Whatever its mechanism of action is, Robo3 deficiency has some profound effects on motor and sensory motor behaviours inmice, zebrafish and humans (Amoiridis et al., 2006; al.,2009; Jen, 2008; Jen et al., 2004; Renier et al., 2010). Humanssuffering from a rare autosomal recessive disease named'horizontal gaze palsy progressive scoliosis' (or HGPPS) carrymutations in ROBO3. In HGPPS patients, both the descending corticospinal tract motor projections and the ascending lemniscalsensory projections are abnormally uncrossed (Haller et al., 2008;Jen, 2008). In addition, patients are unable to perform conjugatelateral eye movements (Jen, 2008). Likewise, robo3/twitch twice double-mutant zebrafish have defects in eye movements andbalance (Burgess et al., 2009). Robo3 null mice die shortly after birth, precluding behavioural studies. However, recently, a uniquegenetic tool designed to probe the function of selected hindbraincommissures was generated by crossing a novel Robo3 conditional- knockout line with transgenic mice expressing Cre of commissural and this is associated with profound motor, sensoryand sensory-motor deficits. Apart from controlling commissural axon guidance and cell migration, there is evidence that Robo/Slit signalling also controlslater aspects of axonal development, as we discuss below. A role in axonal targeting Once they have reached their terminal territory, axons have to findtheir target cells and form synaptic contacts. In most neuronalsystems, axons do not project randomly on target cells but followa precise spatial pattern that often reflects their respective originsin the brain, and defines so-called topographic maps. A role for Slits and Robos in axonal targeting has best been described in the mouse olfactory system (Cho et al., 2009). Briefly,in the principal olfactory system, olfactory sensory neurons olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb (OB)where they connect with the major OB output neurons, mitral cellsand tufted cells. A distinct feature of the mammalian olfactorysystem is that all OSNs that express the same odorant receptorconverge within each OB on a single glomerulus (Ressler, 1994;Vassar, 1994). In many mammals, an accessory olfactory systemexists, which plays an important role in pheromone sensing andREVIEW Development 137 (12) DEVELOPMENT COURSE BOOK PAGE 1091945 REVIEW Development 137 (12) social behaviour (Dulac and Wagner, 2006). In this system, vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSN) of the vomeronasal organ(VNO), project to glomeruli located in the accessory olfactory bulb(AOB). VSNs project in a topographical manner. As such, VSNs thatoriginate in the apical and basal regions of the VNO, project to theanterior and posterior portions of the AOB, respectively (Dulac andWagner, 2006) (Fig. 3). Slits and Robos have been implicated incontrolling the proper targeting of axons in both olfactory systems. Slits are expressed in a gradient in the AOB, with high expression in the anterior region and low expression posteriorly(Knoll et al., 2003). In addition, Slit1 controls the targeting of basalVSN axons, which show abnormal extension into the anterior AOBin (Cloutier et al., 2004) are also misrouted in Slit1/Slit2 double-heterozygous mice, but not in Slit3 knockouts, thus establishing a role for Slit2, in addition to Slit1, in the proper targeting of VSN axons to the AOB(Prince et al., 2009). Although VSNs express both Robo1 andRobo2 receptors, only Robo2 appears to be essential formaintaining segregation of VSN axons in the AOB. Indeed,when Robo2 is specifically deleted from VSNs, some of the basalVSN neurons are misrouted into the anterior AOB, indicating thatSlit1 function is primarily mediated by Robo2 (Prince et al., 2009).In mice, OSNs from the dorsomedial epithelium project to dorsally located glomeruli in the OB, OSNs from theventrolateral of the olfactory epithelium (OE) extend toglomeruli more in the OB (Miyamichi et al., 2005) (Fig.3C). Robo2 has a graded expression profile in the OE, withhighest levels in the dorsomedial region (Cho et al., 2007). InRobo2 and Slit1 knockout mice, a subset of OSN axons that normally segregate in a glomerulus located in the dorsal region ofthe OB form a glomerulus in the ventral region, which indicatesthat Robo2 and Slit1 are necessary for the proper targeting of OSNaxons to their appropriate location within the OB (Cho et al.,2007). In robo2 mutant zebrafish, glomerular spatial arrangements in the main olfactory system are also impaired (Miyasaka et al.,2005). The mistargeting of OSN axons is even more obvious inRobo1/Robo2 and Slit1/Slit2 double-null mice, in which OSNs that express the same odorant receptors project on to multipleglomeruli (Nguyen-Ba-Charvet et al., 2008) (Fig. 3C).Interestingly, Slits and Robos also act on other aspects of thedevelopment of the olfactory system, in controlling the migrationof OB interneurons (see references above) and in the pathfindingof the axons of OB output neurons (Fouquet et al., Nguyen-Ba-Charvet null Robo2 null (c) Slit1/2 null Robo1/2 null ** * *A PML D VM LFig. 3.

It is unclearwhether Slit/Robo play a similar role in the targeting ofmotoneuron dendrites in vertebrates. Molecular mechanisms regulating Slit/Robo functionMigrating cells and growing axons often change direction duringtheir journey, and the repertoire of receptors they express at theirsurface is tightly controlled by the environmental factors theyencounter. Accordingly, during mouse development, the expressionof Robo receptors is known to be precisely regulated in time andspace. By contrast, Slits appear to be expressed in a more stableway in the embryo. Below, we review some of the ways in whichtranscriptional regulation, receptor transport to the membrane andalternative splicing control the expression of Robo receptors. Transcriptional regulation The transcriptional regulation of Robo receptor expression at themidline contributes to the modulation of axon guidance decisions.The molecular mechanisms that underpin this regulation haveremained elusive, but recent studies have identified some of thetranscription factors involved. In Drosophila, the protein Midline, which belongs to the T-box family of transcription factors (Stennard and Harvey, 2005),controls the transcription of Robo and Slit along the midline of thecentral and peripheral nervous systems (Liu et al., 2009).Interestingly, Midline has orthologues in other species, such asTbx20 in the mouse (Liu et al., 2009). Moreover, this transcriptionfactor is evolutionarily conserved from flies to humans, suggestingthat its transcriptional regulation of Robos and Slits is a conservedmechanism (Takeuchi et al., 2005). Accordingly, both Tbx20 and Slit1/Slit2 knockout mice have defects in the development of hindbrain motoneurons (Hammond et al., 2005; Song et al., 2006).In the mouse, Tbx1 regulates a second transcription factor, Gbx2,which functions in hindbrain and pharyngeal arch artery (PAA)development (Calmont et al., 2009). In further support of this, theexpression of Slit2 and Robo1 is downregulated in Tbx1 and Gbx2 null mouse mutants (Calmont et al., 2009). This suggests that these transcription factors directlyregulate Slit2 and Robo1 expression, and that Slits and Robos playa role in controlling PAA development. In the case of Robo3, several transcription factors that could control its expression have been identified. Robo3 was discoveredas a gene that is upregulated in retinoblastoma ( Rb)-deficient mice (Yuan et al., 1999). It was later confirmed that Rb represses Robo3 promoter activity in vitro but also that Pax2 activates Robo3 transcription by binding to Rb and thereby inhibiting its repressorfunction on Robo3 (Yuan et al., 2002). Robo3 expression is also upregulated in a subset of mammillary neurons of the hypothalamus of mouse embryos deficient for thebasic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors Sim1 and Sim2(Marion mammillary axons are reroutedtoward the midline in Sim1/Sim2 null mice, possibly because of abnormal Robo3 expression (Marion et al., 2005). Different combinations of transcription factors from the LIM homeodomain (LIM-HD) family have been found to confer subtypeidentity to neurons in which they are expressed; they are also ableto control the migration of these neurons (Avraham et al., 2009;Polleux et al., 2007). In the dorsal spinal cord of the mouse, a subsetof interneurons, the dl1 neurons, express the two LIM-HDtranscription factors, Lhx2 and Lhx9. However, the level ofexpression of these two factors differs between dl1 interneurons thatproject ipsilaterally and those that project contralaterally (Wilson etal., 2008). The commissural contingent expresses higher levels ofLhx2 and lower levels of Lhx9 than does the ipsilateral InLhx2/ Lhx9 double-null mutants, is but commissural dl1 neurons fail to express Robo3, and,as a result, their axons do not project across the floor plate. In gelshift assays, Lhx2 directly interacts with consensus LIM bindingsites which indicates that LIM-HD proteins are activatorsof Robo3 transcription (Wilson et al., 2008). The Hox genes encode homeodomain-containing transcription factors that control the patterning of the body axis, as well asneuronal specification and connectivity (Dasen et al., 2008). Theyare highly expressed in the hindbrain in a rhombomere-specificcode (Kiecker and Lumsden, 2005). The analysis of pontine neurondevelopment in Hoxa2 and Hoxb2 null mice has revealed that their migration is perturbed and that cohorts of neurons abandon themain stream prematurely (Geisen et al., 2008). This phenotype ishighly reminiscent of the defects observed in Robo1/Robo2, Slit1/Slit2 and Robo2/Slit2 double-null mice. This result together with the presence of Hox binding sites in the Robo2 locus, suggests that Robo genes could be direct targets of Hox transcriptionfactors. This hypothesis is further supported by chromatinimmunoprecipitation experiments and the downregulation ofRobo2 expression in Hoxa2/Hoxb2-deficient pontine neurons (Geisen et al., 2008). The presence of Hox binding sites in theDrosophila Robo2 gene suggests that Hox transcription factors might control Robo gene expression in many species and tissues(Kraut and Zinn, 2004). Robo receptor transport regulation In the ventral nerve cord of Drosophila, Robo-expressing commissural axons pre-crossing commissural axons grow towards transmembrane proteinCommissureless (Comm), which diverts Robo to the endosomesfor degradation (Keleman et al., 2002). Upon entering the midline,an unknown mechanism diminishes Comm expression, resulting inincreased amounts of Robo at the membrane and, consequently, inthe axon being repelled from the midline to prevent it from re-crossing (Keleman et al., 2005). Comm expression can also beregulated in other ways. For instance, a recent study has revealedthat Frazzled/Dcc (Fra), in addition to being a receptor for Netrin,can also influence the expression of comm mRNA (Yang et al., 2009). In this context, Frazzled concurrently regulates the attractionof commissural axons in response to Netrin and the silencing ofrepulsive cues by negatively regulating the presence of Robo at themembrane via comm expression. This latter function occurs independently of the presence of Netrin. Moreover, other dataobtained in Drosophila show that the RNA-binding protein Elav (embryonic lethal, abnormal vision) interacts with Robo Slit ina dose-dependent manner and regulates comm mRNA (Simionato et al., 2007). As a Comm homologue has not been found in vertebrates, it was not clear until recently whether receptor sorting also contributed tothe regulation of Robo expression in vertebrates. However, newyeast two-hybrid experiments have identified the ubiquitin-specificprotease 33 (Usp33) as a Robo1 partner and have provided in vitroREVIEW Development 137 (12) DEVELOPMENT COURSE BOOK PAGE 1111947 REVIEW Development 137 (12) and in vivo evidence that these two proteins interact (Yuasa- Kawada et al., 2009a; Yuasa-Kawada et al., 2009b). The role ofubiquitin-mediated modification in regulating protein stability andfunction has been well established (Hershko and Ciechanover,1998). Upon examining the effect of Usp33 interaction with Robo,it was demonstrated that this de-ubiquitylating enzyme is requiredfor the Slit-responsiveness of commissural 2009a; Yuasa-Kawada et both of these functions by eitherpreventing Robo1 from being targeted for degradation or (see Box 2) are key components inmidline crossing, and there is increasing evidence that theirsignalling pathways are intertwined and regulate one another atdifferent level. As mentioned above, netrin 1 attracts commissuralaxons at the midline upon binding to Dcc, whereas Slit repels themafter binding Robo1 or A chimeras demonstrated that in commissural axons the cytosolic domains of these receptors are theeffectors of their attractive or repulsive responses (Bashaw andGoodman, 1999). Moreover, in the presence of Slit, Robo1 bindsto Dcc to silence netrin 1 attraction (Stein and Tessier-Lavigne,2001). Whether Dcc can interact directly with the other Roboreceptors to modulate attraction or repulsion is currently unknown.In addition, experiments in C. elegans have shown that UNC- 40/Dcc participates in SLT-1/SAX-3 signalling in a netrin-independent manner and that this modulation involves UNC-34/Ena. It had been previously shown that UNC-40/Dcc potentiatesthe netrin 1998; Hedgecock et al., A Slit1-3 Robo1/2Dcc UNC-40/DccDRepulsionRobo1(a) (b) Plasma membraneFig. 4.

By contrast, recent work indicates that UNC-73/Trio can also be negatively regulated by the CRML-1/CARMIL(Capping, Arp2/3, Myosin I Linker) protein. This decreases thelevels at the membrane (Vanderzalm et al., 2009)(Fig. 4D). Finally, although the effect of netrins and Slits are diametrically opposed, they act together to specify the lateral positioning ofdopaminergic axons in the diencephalon (Kastenhuber et al., 2009).In this system, attraction mediated by Dcc/netrin 1 appears to becounterbalanced by Slit/Robo2 signalling (Kastenhuber et Similarly, Robo and Frazzled are required cellautonomously in motoneurons for the appropriate targeting of theirneurites to their respective muscle fields; this action is controlledby the combinatorial and opposing actions of Robo and Frazzled(Brierley et al., 2009; Mauss et al., 2009). Conclusion As illustrated here, the range of biological functions that involvethe Slits and Robos is much broader than was originally thought.Thus, a major question in this field concerns how different Slits areable to mediate their disparate actions. Slits have been shown tobind with similar affinity to all of the Robo receptors usingevolutionarily conserved binding residues (Brose et al., 1999;Morlot et al., 2007). However, in different systems, Slits mediatediffering effects; for instance OSN axonal targeting is modulatedby Slit1 and Slit2, but not by Slit3 (Prince et al., 2009). It willtherefore be important to identify the molecules, such as co-receptors, that mediate such ligand specificity. Another remaining enigma is how increasing or decreasing levels of Robo receptors and/or different combinations of Roboreceptors mediate varying effects within a given cell or betweenneighbouring cells. In Drosophila, a combinatorial Robo code specifies the lateral position of longitudinal axons; in this system, the expression ofonly one Robo receptor (Robo1) specifies a medial positioning ofthese whereas expression of all three Robo receptors drivesaxons laterally. By contrast, the expression of Robo1 and Robo3causes an intermediate positioning (Rajagopalan et al., 2000;Simpson et al., 2000). One possible interpretation of these resultsis that the higher the levels are of Robo receptors at the surface oflongitudinal axons , the more these axons will respond to the repulsive effect of Slits that are present at the midline. Similarly,there are phenotypical differences between Robo1 null and hypomorphic mutant mice, which indicate that different levels ofRobo receptors at the membrane within the same cell mediatesubtly different effects (Andrews et al., 2006; Lopez-Bendito et al.,2007). However, more recent studies suggest that, in Drosophila, the lateral position of longitudinal axons is not determined by aparticular combination of Robo proteins [the so-called 'Robo code'(Rajagopalan 2000; al., 2000)], but is ratherdriven by differential Robo gene expression (Evans et al., 2010;Spitzweck et al., 2010). The different responses of Robos to Slitswould reflect intrinsic structural differences in the extracellular of Robos. For instance, Robo2 positioning and the Robo1 cytoplasmic domain preventsmidline crossing (Spitzweck et al., 2010). There are also cases inwhich the identity of the Robo receptors or of their combinationcould be the determining factor in the type of response generated.This could for instance contribute to specifying the position oflongitudinal axons in the Drosophila nerve cord. Likewise, in the mouse spinal cord, Robo2 rather than Robo1, controls thepositioning of a longitudinal axonal tract, the lateral funiculus(Long et al., 2004). Moreover, chick commissural axons thatprematurely misexpress Robo2 fail to enter the floor andpreferentially adopt a longitudinal phenotype (Reeber et Drosophila tergotrochanteral motoneuron (TTMn), the dendrites overexpressionof Robo repels TTMn dendrites Robo2 or Robo3 at the surface of TTMndendrites has no noticeable effect (Godenschwege et al., 2002).Further studies need to be conducted on Robo receptor subtypes toelucidate the specificity of each isoform in mediating particulareffects in different systems. Research into the signalling mechanisms of Slit/Robo needs to advance in order to resolve these outstanding questions. Suchadvances will require adopting a cross-disciplinary approach forstudying Slits and Robos in order to integrate information fromsuch disparate fields as CNS and heart development, and immunecell migration and tumourigenesis.

The unique morphology of the individual muscle ber isdictated by the functional demands necessary to generate andwithstand the forces of contraction, which in turn leads to movement. Contractile muscle bers are elongated, syncytial cells, which interact with both the nervous and skeletal systemsto govern body motion. In this review, we focus on three keycell-cell and cell -matrix contact processes, that are necessary to create this exquisitely specialized cell: cell fusion, cellelongation, and establishment of a myotendinous junction.

All rights reserved. DOI 10.1016/j.ceb.2010.08.009 Introduction The model system, Drosophila melanogaster , has been used to great effect to study fundamental issues of muscle development [ 1-7]. This model organism offers the cell biologist an in vivo system, coupled to a long-established genetic tradition to study muscle morphogenesis. In addition, application of genomics and varied imaging approaches makes this model a highly tractable systemfor the study of the cell biology of muscle. Body wall muscles in Drosophila are generated twice during the life of the fly: rst, during embryogenesis to form the larval muscles [1 ], the process that is the main focus of this review; and subsequently during metamorphosis, in which cells set aside during embryo- nic myogenesis are used to generate the adult muscles[8]. In the embryo, a single ber is considered a single muscle, whereas in the adult, multiple bers constitute a single muscle. A similar mechanism, however, governs ber formation in both situations: each ber is seeded by a specialized myoblast, called a founder cell (FC),which fuses repeatedly with neighboring fusion compe- tent myoblasts generate a multi-nucleated myotube Upon fusion, the newly orated FCM-derived nuclei adopt the transcriptionalprole of the FC/myotube. By virtue of a complex developmental specication process, individual FCs/myotubes express different c ombinations of cell iden- tity regulators, which endow them with unique morpho-logical characteristics, inc luding size (i.e. the number of fusions with FCMs), shape, and spatial orientation [9,10 /C15/C15]. Fusion is accompanied by elongation of the growingmyober, which navigates towards tendon cells that arise in the overlying epidermis. Through interactionswith these tendon cells, a stable attachment forms between muscle, epidermis, and cuticle (the exoskele- ton) ( Figure myogenic pro- cesses -fusion, elongation, and attachment -are at the heart of this review. Innervation of each muscleber occurs after fusion and tendon attachment, while the stereotypical arrangement of the ber contractile apparatus (sarcomeres) appears late during muscle morphogenesis, just before hatching [ 1,10]. The con- tractile properties and inter-cellular associations provide body wall muscles with the capacity to execute and govern larval motility. Muscle ber as syncytial cell: focus on the actin focus A series of recent reviews provide a comprehensive, updated description of myoblast fusion in Drosophila and in vertebrates [ 11/C15,12,13,14/C15]. Here we discuss recent insights to fusion, emphasizing the remaining gaps in ourknowledge, with particular emphasis on the contribution of the actin-based cytoskeleton. Myoblast fusion, as in all cases of cell -cell fusion, requires several distinct cellular behaviors [ 15]. Initially, FCs/ myotubes and FCMs must recognize and adhere to each other. The result of recognition and adhesion is a series of cellular events that are necessary to bring the cell mem-branes of the two cells in close proximity to one another. Subsequently, the tethering of the plasma membranes, the formation of pores between the membranes and theexpansion of these pores leads to the merging of the two myoblasts ( Figure 1d). Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2010, 22:566 -574 www.sciencedirect.com COURSE BOOK PAGE 118In the Drosophila embryo, myoblast recognition and adhesion is mediated by a set of immunoglobulin (Ig) domain transmembrane proteins: Dumbfounded (Duf, a.k.a Kirre) and Roughest (Rst a.k.a IrreC), which are found primarily in FCs, and the FCM elements Sticks and stones(Sns) and Fusion-related these proteins have been recentlyrevealed [ 17,18 ], implying conservation of this system of cell recognition and adhesion. However, several signicant issues pertaining to the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear, and require further investigation. Promi-nent among these are the initiation of contact between distant myoblasts (is a diffusible factor involved?), selec- tion of ('rst come, rst serve' of partnering'), and generation of tightly apposed myoblast membranes, primed for fusion. Recent evidence suggests that the Ig domain recognition receptors form aring-like structure, termed the FuRMAS [ 13,19 /C15]a tt h e fusion site. These data have been used to suggest that therecognition receptors, upon engagement, are cleared fromthe site of actual membrane fusion. The FuRMAS, by the nature of a ring-like structure, could also limit the site of membrane fusion to within this ring. Time-lapse imagingof tagged receptors would provide a signicant step forwardin verifying this model. Downstream of the receptors, genetic, cell, and bio- chemical approaches have implicated a set of actin regu-latory proteins as crucial for myoblast fusion. Specically, mutations in genes including Rac, Myoblast city (Dock 180), Kette (Nap1), Scar (WAVE), Vrp1 (Solitary; in myoblast fusion [11 /C15,12,13,14/C15]. While clarication is needed as to how particular actin regulatory proteins are recruited speci- cally to the recognition receptors and the fusion site [20,21/C15,22,23,24/C15/C15,25/C15/C15,26/C15/C15,27,28,29/C15/C15,30], it is clear that one crucial result of their function is a branched actin structure, termed the actin focus [ 19/C15,25/C15/C15,29/C15/C15]. Time- lapse imaging of Drosophila myoblasts proved conclusively that this structure marks the fusion site and revealed thedynamics of this structure. The actin focus is on average short-lived (11.9 min, range 5.7 -29 min), measuring 2 mm 2 in size (range 0.7 -4.5mm2); this structure disappears as cytoplasmic continuity between the fusing cells isachieved ( Figure 2 ). Genetic analysis reveals that actin focus formation requires recognition receptor function forBorn to run: creating the muscle fiber Schejter and Baylies 567 Figure 1 The morphogenesis of Drosophila larval body wall muscles.

Consistent with these genetic exper- iments is the observation that the FuRMAS surrounds the actin focus [ 13,19/C15]. While double labeling experiments using actin and membrane reporter constructs suggest that the actin focus can be found on both sides of the fusion event (myotube and FCM), the distribution of actin withinthe focus may be biased to one cell or the other [ 25 /C15/C15,29/C15/C15] (B. Richardson, I. Bothe and MKB unpub.). Whether thisindicates the existence of different actin structures orreveals novel aspects of actin focus maturation remains to be investigated. With genetics implicating SCAR/WAVE and WASp regu- lation of Arp2/3 as crucial to myoblast fusion, a simple model would be that these actin regulatory pathways arerequired for actin focus formation. However, contrary to expectation, analysis of single and double mutants between different pathway members reveals persistent and evenenlarged actin foci at fusion sites [ 24] (B. Richardson and MKB unpub). The genetic data indicate, therefore, thatthese pathways are not required for formation of the foci,but may ut may influence actin rearrangements leading to dissolution of these structures. While some debate con- tinues, these data also illustrate that the proteins requiredfor formation of the actin focus remain to be identied. Additional Arp2/3 regulators have been uncovered in other systems [ 31], providing new genes to investigate for this key role in actin regulation during myoblast fusion. An essential question arising from these studies is the function of the actin focus at the fusion site. Time-lapseimaging correlates formation and, importantly, removal of the actin focus, with cytoplasmic continuity and ulti-mately cell -cell fusion. With the exception of the recog- nition receptors and a protein implicated in receptor recycling, mutants of which do not form actin foci, allother known fusion gene mutants display actin foci that perdure at the fusion site. Of these, some mutants have enlarged foci and others have wild-type sized foci[14,29 /C15/C15,32]. Testing is needed to determine whether the fusion block in any of these mutants is due to theinability of the cell to remove the focus specically, orwhether the long-lived focus is just a consequence of other events gone awry. Nevertheless, several models for the cellular function of the actin focus have been putforward. These include targeting vesicles to the site of fusion [ 25 /C15/C15], supplying scaffolding to maintain cellular integrity while fusion pores are created [ 29/C15/C15], and/or providing a force for fusion pore enlargement [ 26]. To provide the necessary data to evaluate these models, a combination of approaches are needed: identication ofnew genes and mechanisms via genetic and biochemical experiments; improved imaging, employing time-lapse videography and transmission electron microscopy; deter-mination of composition and dynamics of cell membranes and membrane-bound vesicles associated with the fusion site; and nally, detailed description and analysis offusion pore formation and expansion. While the Droso- phila system has provided new views of a prominent and highly regulated form of cell -cell fusion, much remains to be investigated, particularly with regard to the cell-bio- logical mechanism underlying the fusion process.

The highly stereotypic pattern of muscle - tendon attachments implies that regulatory mechanisms are at play, ensuring specicity and proper execution of the myotube targeting process. It is well-established thattendon cells produce spatial cues influencing the direc- tion towards which myotubes extend. The muscles, in turn, seek out their attachment sites by sending outlopodia-like extensions that survey their environment for these instructive cues [ 1,33]. Perhaps the sole bona de identication of a tendon- derived guidance signal has been described in the ven- tral-longitudinal (VL) muscles, a repeating set of fourparallel bers that stretch between epidermal attach- ments sites at the adjacent embryonic segment border. Segment-border tendon cells secrete the ECM glyco-protein Slit, which directs myotube targeting by binding to the Roundabout (Robo) receptor, expressed at the edges of developing VL muscle bers [ 34 /C15]. Therefore, although the Slit -Robo ligand -receptor interaction is best known as the basis for repulsion of both axons and musclebers away from the ventral midline of the Drosophila embryo [ 35], it also functions as an attractive cue, guiding myotubes to specic epidermal target sites. Mutations inwhich properly fused myotubes extend randomly and failto connect to their epidermal target sites have recently uncovered a second myotube targeting mechanism, apparently acting in parallel to the Slit/Robo pathway[36 /C15/C15,37/C15,38/C15/C15,39/C15/C15]. Importantly, mutant myotubes of this class are capable of forming stable attachments,but do so with incorrect tendon target cells, or even withadjacent muscles, implying specic impairment of targetrecognition capacity, while other aspects of myotube differentiation remain unaffected. A key player thathas emerged from this group is D-Grip, the sole fly homolog of the Grip (Glutamate receptor interactingprotein) adaptor protein family. Grip proteins harbor multiple PDZ domains, and have been functionally implicated in various aspects of synaptic protein trafck-ing and localization [ 40-42]. In Drosophila embryos, D- Grip is specically expressed in developing muscles, and the D-Grip protein accumulates within endosomes at theends of extending myobers [ 39]. While D-Grip probably acts as a mediator of intracellulartrafcking, it is becoming apparent that this multi-PDZ- domain adaptor serves a key myogenic role as a common platform for multiple muscle factors contributing to myo-tube targeting. Prominent among these is Kon-tiki (Kon; a.k.a Perdido), a transmembrane protein and potential recognition of tendon-cell guidancesignals by growing embryonic myotubes [ D-Grip through a C-terminal PDZ bind-ing domain, localizes to the ends of extending VL myo-tubes, and is required for D-Grip localization to these sites. Kon contributes to additional aspects of muscle - tendon attachment. One of these is to regulate the extent of motile exploratory activity by myotube ends [ 38 /C15/C15]. Interestingly, a similar function has been recently pro-posed for the tendon cell transmembrane protein LRT[43 /C15], which can physically associate with Robo receptors. LRT may therefore restrict myotube migratory activityby signaling through Robo, or indirectly, by competingwith Slit for Robo receptor binding, thereby stifling its stimulatory effect on myotube dynamics [ 43,44 ]. Such utilization of both muscle and tendon-based programs underscores the importance of setting limits on guidance-seeking mechanisms, once initial target recognition is achieved.Born to run: creating the muscle fiber Schejter and Baylies 569 Figure 3 Elongation and attachment of the myotube to tendon cells.

Structurally related to the vertebrate Nectins, Ed functions as a homotypic cell adhesion molecule, aspects of Drosophila neurogenesis and epithelial morphogenesis [ 46-48]. Similar to Kon, Ed associates with D-Grip PDZ domains via its extreme C-terminal region. Furthermore, Ed colocalizes with D-Grip at the ends of VL muscles, and the two elements displaystrong genetic interactions with respect to VL myotube extension defects [ 45]. Targeting and guidance errors rather than defective adhesion are the main characteristic of embryos in which the Ed/D-Grip system is impaired, implying that Ed and D-Grip influence myotube behavior by affecting cortical and cytoplasmic features of thesecells. Signicantly, Ed affects the outcome of cell -cell interactions through communication with cortical micro-laments [ 48-50], and therefore serves as a good candi- date for a link between the D-Grip platform and the actin- based cytoskeleton. This series of studies has therefore revealed a molecular complex, positioned at the tips of growing muscle bers, which integrates a number of inputs aimed at achievingproper myotube targeting. Remarkably, a highly similar Grip-based platform mediates glia -neuron interactions during mammalian CNS development [ 51]. In this instance, the PDZ domains of Grip bring together severalglial cell-surface proteins, including NG2, a mammalian homolog of Kon [ 52,53 ], which is thought to interact with a neuronal receptor. Cortical complexes of this type therefore represent a conserved machinery for instructive communication between distinct cell types, leading tofunctional maturation of a differentiating tissue. While involvement of the Grip-based complex in myo- tube targeting implies functional reliance on the actin- based cytoskeleton, mutati ons resulting in defective muscle targeting have now revealed that growing myo- tubes also require properly polarized microtubule (MT) arrays, in order to reach their correct attachment sites [37 /C15]. Key elements involved in this system are Tumble- weed (Tum) and Pavarotti (Pav), established com- ponents cytokinesis-mediating complex 54-56]. In Drosophila embryonic muscles, Tum for local- ization of non-centrosomal, g-tubulin-based microtubule organizing centers to the vicinity of myotube nuclei. These nuclei commonly cluster in the center of growing multi-nucleated bers [ 37/C15]. The resulting microtubule array that forms extends fr om the myotube interior towards the periphery, and is polarized, with the micro- tubule plus-ends pointing towards the extending tips of the growing bers. A simila rly oriented microtubule array, nucleated from non-centrosomal cen- ters, forms in cultured mammalian myotubes [ 57], suggesting that reorganization of the microtubule cytos-keleton in this fashion reflects a conserved requirement during muscle differentiat ion. From a functional stand- point, the axial microtubule array may serve as a struc- tural framework enabling elongation of myotube ends [37/C15,57], or alternatively, may provide polarized tracks for trafcking and localization of crucial guidance and tar- geting signals that ensure proper selection of myotube attachment sites. Making a strong myotendinous junction Contact between myotubes and tendon cells is closelyfollowed by establishment of a myotendinous junction, so that muscle and epidermis maintain a strong physicalconnection that will be able to withstand the considerable forces imposed on it once muscle contractions initiate [58]. Integrins play a major, conserved role in this process, and indeed, the Drosophila embryonic myotendinous junction now serves as a prominent example and settingfor study of integrin-based adhesion between distinct celltypes [ 59]. Both muscle and tendon cells express ab integrin heterodimers, which fortify cell attachment tothe junction by serving transmembrane links betweenthe ECM and the internal actin cytoskeleton. These heterodimers are composed of a common bsubunit (bPS) and distinct asubunits\u2014 aPS1 for the tendon cell integrin and aPS2 in muscles. Genetic disruption of the muscle aPS2bPS integrin does not interfere with con- struction, elongation, and attachment of muscle bers. However, once the muscles of such mutant embryosbegin to contract, they disconnect from their attachment sites and retract into ball-shaped structures [ 60-63]. This classic 'myospheroid' phenotype now serves as a diag- nostic tool for identication of additional elements con- tributing to formation and consolidation of myotendinous junctions. Several ECM components act as ligands for the Droso- phila aPS2bPS integrin in the the myotendi- nous junction, including the Laminin a-chain protein Wing Blister [ 64], and Tiggrin [ ]. Recent studies have (Tsp) as a major aPS2bPS attachment sites [ 67 Thrombospondins comprise a family of multimeric ECM glycoproteins, which have been implicated in diverse functional settings, such ascell aggregation and attachment, angiogenesis and synap- is produced and by at stages corresponding to estab- lishment of muscle- tendon contacts. The muscle detach- ment of Tsp mutant embryos, genetic interactions of Tspwith integrin encoding genes, and biochemical binding assays, combine to identify Tsp as a ligand for aPS2bPS. The integrin-binding capacity and localization patterns of Tsp suggest a dynamic sequence [67 /C15/C15,68/C15/C15], in which Tsp rst contributes to the initial association of myotube ends with the tendon cell and itsECM. Subsequently, muscle -tendon interactions set in570 Cell-to-cell contact and extracellular matrix Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2010, 22:566 -574 www.sciencedirect.com COURSE BOOK PAGE 122motion a general program of tendon cell differentiation [72], leading to increased expression and secretion of Tsp, which in turn forties the integrin-mediated myotube attachment to the myotendinous junction. Further insight to the regulation of Tsp activity comes from the study of Slowmotion (Slow), a new player in myoten- dinous junction construction [ 73/C15]. Slow, the EGFL7 [ 74,75 is parallel to Tsp, and attenuates the Tsp-aPS2bPS integrin interaction by forming a complex with Tsp. Streamlining of muscle integrin activity in this man- ner turns out to be crucial for proper morphogenesis of the myotendinous junction into a structure capable of with- standing the wear-and-tear of intense larval muscle activity[73]. Progress in the understanding of integrin -ECM inter- actions in the context of myotendinous junction for- mation has been matched by rened characterization of the manner by which integrins are linked to cytoplasmicand cytoskeletal components. Thus the Drosophila homo- log of ZASP (Z-band alternatively spliced PDZ-motifprotein), a member of the PDZ-LIM protein family[76,77 ], acts as an adapter that strengthens the integ- rin-actin connection following its initial establishment via Talin, a ubiquitous mediator of integrin-based processes[78 /C15/C15]. Zasp performs this role repeatedly during myogen- esis, initially to bolster the myotendinous junction, andlater to mediate integrin-dependent assembly of muscleber sarcomeres [ 78]. A second adaptor of this type is Wech [ 79 /C15/C15], a well- conserved member of the growing, multi-domain TRIM protein family, the functional attributes of which are only beginning to emerge [ 80,81,82 ]. At Drosophila myotendi- nous junctions, Wech acts within tendon cells and myo- tubes to bridge a key interaction between Talin, which associates with the bPS integrin subunit, and the Integ- rin-linked Kinase (ILK) complex, a crucial mediator of the integrin-microlament link [ 83]. This specic adaptor capacity of Wech appears to be conserved in mammals [79], suggesting that a fundamental aspect of integrin- mediated adhesion has now been uncovered. Conclusions and perspectives In this review we have focused on a restricted set ofmyogenic processes, to demonstrate the power of theDrosophila embryo as a model system for studying muscle cell properties and behavio rs. A wide variety of issues, such as cell size, shape, polarity, migration, and adhesioncan all be addressed using this versatile system. The relative simplicity and segmentally repeated nature of the embryonic musculature, amenable to study via clas-sical and modern genetic approaches coupled to imaging and biochemical analysis, provide a unique, in vivo experimental setting. The recent introduction of com-prehensive RNAi-based genetic methods to the Droso- phila eld [ 84,85 /C15/C15], along with the application of large- scale genomic techniques [36/C15/C15,86-88] now promises to signicantly enhance these studies. For example, thecapacity to control RNAi expression in a temporal and tissue-specic manner helps overcome a variety ofobstacles confronting more conventional genetic approaches. Importantly, this tool now enables compre- hensive exploration of adult fly myogenesis, and weexpect that considerable insight to issues of muscle cell biology will emerge from this 'new frontier' in the years to come.

Elucidatinghow arterial walls are built could aid understandingof these diseases, but little is known about howconcentric layers of muscle cells and the outer ad- ventitial layer are assembled and patterned around endothelial tubes. Using histochemical, clonal, andgenetic analysis in mice, here we show that thepulmonary artery wall is constructed radially, fromthe inside out, by two separate but coordinatedprocesses. One is sequential induction of successivecell layers from surrounding mesenchyme. The otheris controlled invasion of outer layers by inner layer cells through developmentally regulated cell re- orientation and radial migration. We propose thata radial signal gradient controls these processesand provide evidence that PDGF-B and at least oneother signal contribute. Modulation of such radialsignaling pathways may underlie vessel-specicdifferences and pathological changes in arterial wallsize and structure. INTRODUCTION Although there has been remarkable progress over the past decade elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the critical early events in blood vessel development, generation of new endothelial tubes by vasculogenesis and angiogenesis(Adams and Alitalo, 2007 ;Carmeliet, 2005 ;Jin 2005 ; Phng and Gerhardt, 2009 ;Strili /C19c et al., 2009 ;Weinstein and Law- son, 2002 ), relatively little is known about the subsequent events that create and pattern the arterial wall ( Greif, 2012 ;Hungerford and Little, 1999 ;Hungerford et al., 1996 ;Schwartz, 1997 ). A mature arterial wall typically consists of an endothelial monolayersurrounded by multiple concentric rings of smooth musclecells (SMCs), up to a few dozen or more layers, which dominate the mature arterial wall and provide it with structural integrity and contractility, plus an outer adventitial layer consisting ofbroblasts embedded in a collagen matrix. In many arteries there are also structural specializations such as an elastic layer separating the endothelial cells (ECs) from the vascular smoothmuscle cells (VSMCs), and elastic bers embedded in the smooth muscle layer and other cellular and molecular features that structurally subdivide and pattern the smooth muscle com-partment (tunica media) ( Frid et al., 1994 ,1997 ;McLean et al., 2005 ;Wolinsky and Glagov, 1967 ). The size and pattern of the smooth muscle layer are carefully controlled in a vessel-specicmanner during development, but are dysregulated in manyprominent cardiovascular diseases such as aortic aneurysm, coronary artery atherosclerosis and pulmonary hypertension. Current models of arterial wall development posit that nascent endothelial tubes recruit SMC progenitors, which can apparentlyarise from a variety of sources ( DeRuiter et al., 1997 ;Esner et al., 2006 ;High et al., 2007 ;Jiang et al., 2000 ;Le Lie `vre and Le Douarin, 1975 ;Majesky, 2007 ;Morimoto et al., 2010 ;Que et al., 2008 ;Wasteson et al., 2008 ;Wilm et al., 2005 ;Yamashita et al., 2000 ) and induce them to differentiate into VSMCs. Several signaling pathways have been implicated in VSMC migration or differentiation ( Domenga et al., 2004 ;Gaengel et al., 2009 ; Hirschi et al., 1998 ;Lindahl et al., 1997 ;Mizugishi et al., 2005 ; Owens et al., 2004 ;Suri et al., 1996 ), but how these cells are recruited and organized into a radially patterned structure with the appropriate number and identity of layers is not well under- stood. Here we describe the development of the pulmonaryartery (PA) wall using histochemical, clonal, and genetic analysis in mice. We show that the wall is constructed radially, from the inside out, by sequential induction and recruitment of successivecell layers from surrounding mesenchymal cells, and by develop- mentally regulated invasion of outer layers by inner layer cells. We also show that the endothelial-specic ligand PDGF-B can initiate wall formation but provide genetic evidence that one ormore other, as yet unidentied, signals also contribute to the initiation and radial patterning of the wall. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Pulmonary Artery Smooth Muscle Cells Arise from Lung Mesenchyme To elucidate the cellular and molecular events of arterial wall formation, we focused on a small region of a developing mouse 482 Developmental Cell 23, 482-493, September 11, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. COURSE BOOK PAGE 127artery, the left PA between the level of the carina (ca) and rst branch off the left bronchus (LL1; Figure 1 A). We selected this artery because of its relatively simple structure at birth, justtwo and occasionally three SMC layers plus an outer adventitiallayer ( Figures 1 B-1D), the ease and precision in its identication and developmental staging provided by the adjacent bronchial AB C E F GH I J I' I''D Figure 1.

We carried out lineage tracing with cell- and tissue-specic Cre transgenes to investigate the developmental origin of PA SMCs. Previous studies have shown that SMCs of the outflow tract of the right heart originate at least in part from neural crest (Kirby et al., 1983 ;Majesky, 2007 ), but SMCs of more distal segments of the PA have been proposed to arise largely fromlung mesothelial cells ( Que et al., 2008 ) and ECs ( Morimoto et al., 2010 ) by epithelial- and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transitions. However, our analysis of PA SMCs in E18.5 lungsfollowing lineage ROSA26RmTmGCre reporter endothelium, neural crest, and airway epithe- lium are not substantial sources of SMCs of the PA during this period ( Figure 1 E;Figures S1 A and S1B available online; data not shown). In contrast, lineage tracing with a recently generated lung mesenchyme-specic conditional transgene Tbx4-CreERT2 (M.K., P. al., 2008 ), induced at E10.5, resulted in substantial labeling of E18.5 PA cells expressing the SMC marker alpha-smoothmuscle actin (SMA), demonstrating that Tbx4 +lung mesen- chyme is a major, and possibly the sole source of PA SMCs at this stage ( Figures 1 F and S1C). Induction of the First Layer of Arterial Smooth Muscle At/C24E11, the rst layer of the PA wall begins to form by a stereo- typed sequence of molecular and cellular events that occur in the mesenchymal cells surrounding the nascent PA endothelial tube(Figure 2 ). Platelet-derived growth factor receptor bis initially expressed diffusely in the proximal lung mesenchyme(Figure 1 G), when pulmonary ECs form a widely distributed plexus ( Parera et al., 2005 ; P. Bogard, M.K., R. Metzger, and M.A.K., unpublished data; Figure 1 H). But during the next day its expression begins to restrict to the group of mesenchymalcells surrounding the nascent PA endothelial tube, in the domain that will form the arterial wall ( Figures 1 I, 1I', 1I'') (see below). Beginning at /C24E11.5, smooth muscle markers such as SMA are induced in the PDGFR- b +cells directly contacting the PA EC tube ( Figures 2 A and 2B). SMA is initially expressed at low levels and in a discontinuous fashion along the length of the PA, with more expressing cells on the lateral than the medialaspect of the vessel and localization of SMA protein initially polarized toward the side of the cell contacting the EC layer (Figures S2 A, S2B, and S2B' ). Other SMC markers also initiate expression at this time including smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) ( Miano et al., 1994 ), actin and SM22-alpha, glial-2 F; data not shown). The expres- sion of all four of these SMC markers increases over the nextfew days, forming a robustly labeled layer of smooth muscle(Figures 2 C-2F and S2C; data not shown). As SMC markers are induced in rst layer cells, PDGFR- b expression is downregulated in these cells ( Figure S2 C) and by E18.5, expression was generally not detected in them ( Fig- ure S2 D). Permanent marking of cells with a PDGFR- b-Cre transgene ( Foo et al., 2006 )(Fig- ure S1 E) labeled almost all SMA +PA wall cells at E18.5 ( Figures 1J and S1D), including inner layer cells that do not express PDGFR- bat this time, conrming their origin from cells that initially expressed the gene. During this period of dynamic marker expression, rst layer cells reorient. Initially, at E11.5, many rst layer SMA+cells and their nuclei were elongated longitudinally along the blood vessel(Figures 2 A and 2B, ''alignment''). However, over the next few days, rst layer cells shortened along their longitudinal axis (Figures 2 C and 2D, ''shortening''), and by E14.5 they were cir- Figures 2 E, 2F, and S2E, ''reorientation''), as they are in the mature vessel. Thus, over a 3 day period (E11.5to E14.5), the rst layer of the PA wall forms by a stereotyped series of cell marker and morphogenesis events. A C E G B D FH Figure 2.

COURSE BOOK PAGE 129Sequential Induction of the Outer Layers of the Arterial Wall A few days after rst layer cells initiate the arterial wall program, surrounding mesenchymal cells initiate a similar series ofevents to form the second layer of the arterial wall. At E13.5, these second layer cells express PDGFR- band are elongated longitudinally, as rst layer cells were 2 days earlier ( Figures 2C and 2D). The next day smooth muscle markers begin to be expressed in these cells ( Figures 2 E and 2F), and as smooth muscle marker expression increases over the next several days, these cells downregulate PDGFR- bexpression ( Fig- ure S2 D), similar to the changes noted in rst layer cells several days earlier. During this time, most of the cells shorten in thelongitudinal axis and reorient to a circumferential orientation,forming the second layer of the arterial wall ( Figures 1 B, 1C, 2G, and 2H). As the second layer is forming, cells surrounding this layer initiate a similar program to form the outer layer of the arterialwall. At /C24E14, these outer layer cells express PDGFR-b and are elongated longitudinally along the artery ( Figures 2 C and 2D), like early rst and second layer cells. However, the outerlayer cells do not progress through the full program. By E18.5, they have not turned on SMC markers or downregulated PDGFR- bexpression, and they have not undergone longitudinal shortening or reorientation ( Figures 1 B, 1C, 2G, and 2H). Thus, outer layer cells initiate the arterial wall program but arrestearly on, forming the adventitial layer of the wall. These cellsdo not appear to complete the program, at least not during embryogenesis. Taken together, the results show that the PA wall is con- structed radially, from the inside-out, by sequential activation of an arterial wall program in three successive cell layers. Radial Patterning of Cell Division in the Arterial Wall We next investigated cell division in the developing arterial wall by immunostaining for the mitotic marker phosphohistone H3(pH3). There were two unexpected results. First, although undif- ferentiated progenitor cells are thought, in general, to become less proliferative as they differentiate into VSMCs ( Owens et al., 2004 ), we found just the opposite in the developing PA wall. The vast majority of pH3 +mitotic cells ( Figure 3 A) of the E11.5-14.5 PA wall are found in the inner ( Figure 3 B), more differ- entiated layers ( Figure 3 C), most in the innermost layer directly contacting the endothelial tube (layer 1). Cells that turn on SMA maintain their proliferative index, whereas the proliferative index of cells that do not declines ( Figure 3 D). Second, we found that proliferating inner layer cells undergo a developmental shift in division plane orientation. In the earlystages of PA wall development (E11.5-13.5), the axis of divisionof cells in the inner layer (L1) was predominately (>75%) longitudinal ( Figures 3 E and 3F). However, at E14.5 the axis shifts so that most ( /C2475%) inner layer cells now divide radially (Figures 3 E and 3F). This shift is specic to the innermost layer: cells in layer two (L2) and the adventitia (A) divide exclu-sively longitudinally at this stage (Figure 3 F). Below we show by clonal analysis that this shift in division plane orientation corresponds with a transition of inner layer cells to a radially invasive mode in which they enter and help populate the surrounding cell layer.Clonal Analysis of Inner Layer Cells Reveals a Transitionto a Radially Invasive Growth Mode A clonal analysis was carried out in which individual rst layer SMCs were genetically marked to track their proliferativepotential and the nal positions and pattern of the daughter cells (Figure 4 A). To label rst layer cells with GFP, Cre-mediated recombination was induced in transgenic SMMHC-creER T2, ROSA26RmTmG/+embryos using a single limiting dose (0.8- 1.2 mg) of tamoxifen at E11.5, a stage at which SMMHC is ex-pressed exclusively in the rst layer of the developing PA wall. This resulted in rare or no GFP +cells within the entire visualized region of the left PA, so that labeled cells likely derived from a single recombination event. The putative PA wall clones were scored only if among SMMHC-creERT2,ROSA26RmTmG/+litter- mates, there was at least one embryo without marked cells in this region. Similar experiments using a multi-color Rainbow Cre reporter ROSA26RRb/+(Red-Horse et al., 2010 ) showed that all labeled cells in individual left PAs were almost always of a single color, conrming their clonal relationship (see Exper- imental Procedures ). From an analysis of the size of clones between E13.5 and E18.5, we estimate the proliferation rate(doubling time) of PA SMCs as 1.0 \u00b1 0.4 days from E12 to E14, slowing to /C243.8 to E18 ( Table S1 ). (In comparison to these experiments with limiting doses of tamox- ifen, a single high dose of tamoxifen labeled substantially more inner layer cells and formed multicolored ''polyclones,'' as ex- pected; Figures S3 A-S3C.) The positions of daughter cells in 32 PA wall clones derived from individual inner layer cells marked with a limiting dose oftamoxifen at E11.5 and observed at E13.5-18.5 are given in Fig- ure S4 andTable S1 . Daughter cells could potentially distribute in longitudinal, circumferential, and radial directions, and the cells could remain contiguous and form a coherent clone or inter- mingle with unmarked cells to form a dispersed clone ( Figure 4 A). At E13.5, marked cells have proliferated and many daughters have migrated extensively along the longitudinal and circumfer- ential axes, often separating from sibling cells and intermixingwith unlabeled cells ( Figures 4 B, 4C, 4E, and S4). All the daughter cells, however, remain within the inner, SMA +cell layer. A day later, at E14.5, this restriction to radial migration is relaxed, anddaughter cells begin to invade the second layer ( Figures 4 E, S3D,S3E, and S4). Only a small percentage (12.5%) of marked rst layer cells (n = 56) have invaded the second layer at E14.5,increasing to 32% by E17.5-18.5 with marked daughter cellsfound throughout the rst and second layers ( Figures 4 D, 4E, andS4; data not shown). The relaxation of the radial restriction is only partial: although marked inner layer cells migrated exten-sively in the rst and second layers, they did not invade the developing adventitial or intimal layers at this stage ( Figure S4 ). Because there is a full (albeit immature) second layer at E14.5 (Figures 2 E and 2F), we infer that most second layer cells arise from induction of surrounding (i.e., second layer or beyond)lung mesenchyme (see lineage analysis, Figures 1 F, 1J, and S1C), rather than radial movement of inner layer cells. A classical clonal analysis of the abdominal aortic wall in adult women using X chromosome-inactivation (analyzed by PCR) asa crude clone marker suggested limited dispersal of sibling cellsin most clones (Chung et al., 1998 ;Schwartz and Murry, 1998 ), in contrast to the extensive cell migration and mixing we observe.Developmental Cell Radial Construction of an Arterial Wall Developmental Cell 23, 482-493, September 11, 2012 \u00aa2012 Elsevier Inc. 485 COURSE BOOK PAGE 130It will be important to revisit this study using high-resolution clone markers to determine if this difference represents a funda- mental difference between the vessels, organisms, or stages ofdevelopment, or a limitation of the earlier clone marking and analysis strategy. A Gradient Model for Radial Patterning of the Pulmonary Artery Wall Our results show that the PA wall is constructed radially, fromthe inside out ( Figure 5 A), by two separate but coordinated processes. One is sequential induction and recruitment of successive cell layers from surrounding mesenchymal progen- itor cells. Each layer of mesenchymal cells initiates a programof gene expression and undergoes a stereotyped sequence of morphogenesis events over a 3 day period; as one muscle layer forms, the next layer initiates development. The program arrestsearly in the formation of the outermost layer to generate the adventitial layer. The other process is controlled invasion of the surrounding layer by inner layer cells, which initially divide andmigrate extensively within the layer but later radially reorient and either migrate into the second layer or radially divide and send daughter cells into the next developing layer. Becausethis transition to radial invasion coincides with the switch from circumferential to primarily radial cell division, it could be that inner cells only enter an outer layer by radial cell division. Suchcoupling of centrifugal movement to cell division would preventdepletion of rst layer cells, while supplying extra cells needed in the outer layers given their greater circumference but paradox- ical dearth of proliferating cells. We propose that a radial signaling gradient controls and coordinates the two processes ( Figure 5 B). The likely source of the signal is the endothelium, and the kinetics of its production A B C D E F Figure 3.

Mesenchymal cells directly adjacent to the endothelium, exposed to the highest level of signal, would be the rst to inducethe smooth muscle program and would proliferate most.

Signal Gradient Model for PA Wall Patterning and Involvement of PDGF Pathway (A) Summary of cellular and molecular events in radial construction of PA wall. Cell wall progenitor zone surrounding PA endothelial tube is initially marked by PDGFR- bexpression (green cells). Innermost cells (adjacent to endothelium, E) initiate smooth muscle marker expression and morphogenesis (orange cells) and then downregulate PDGFR- b(red cells) to form layer 1. Smooth muscle cycle repeats to form layer 2, and third cycle initiates to form adventitial (A) layer.

COURSE BOOK PAGE 133surrounding cell layer. The low level of signal received by the outermost mesenchymal cells would be sufcient to initiate but not complete the smooth muscle program, creating the adventitial layer. PDGF-B Is One of Multiple Radial Patterning Signals The ligand PDGF-B is an attractive candidate for the radial patterning signal. It has been implicated in VSMC and pericyte (vascular wall cells associated with capillaries) development(Andrae et al., 2008 ;Hoch and Soriano, 2003 ;Lindahl et al., 1997 ), and it is expressed in ECs of the developing PA starting at the time the arterial wall begins to form ( Figure 5 C and data not shown). Its receptors PDGFR-a and PDGFR- bare expressed in an overlapping pattern, complementary to that of PDGF-B, inthe surrounding mesenchyme of the early lung G, 1I, When PDGF-B-loaded agarose cultures, nascent arterial wall up to twolayers thick of PDGFR- b +, SMA+cells began to form around the bead ( Figures 5 D-5F and S5E-S5G ). Many of these cells were not in direct contact with the bead, suggesting that PDGF-B diffuses away from the bead, forming a local gradient that induces nearby mesenchymal cells to initiate arterial wallformation. Later steps in the arterial wall program, such as downregulation of PDGFR- bexpression, did not occur, perhaps because of a requirement for additional signals or declining viability of the explant. Despite the appropriate expression patterns of PDGF-B and its receptors during arterial wall formation and the ability ofPDGF-B to initiate PA wall formation in explants, we found thatradial patterning of the PA in mutant embryos null for PDGF-B was indistinguishable from that in wild-type embryos ( Figures 5G-5I). Similar results were obtained a or conditional PDGFR- Figures 5 J, 5K, S5B-S5D , and data not shown). However, an early step in the process was inhibited in doublemutants lacking both PDGF receptors Tbx4-Cre )(Figures 5 L and 5M). Taken together, results of these genetic experiments and the PDGF-B bead experiments implicate PDGF involvement in radial patterning but indicate redundancy among both the ligands and receptors. Although it would be elegant if the radial patterning signal was a single diffusible factor, our results suggest it is an ensemble of factors, including PDGF-B and at least one other as yet uniden- tied signal. Multiple factors would provide flexibility in thecontrol of vessel wall structure, important in generating the diver- sity of such structures and disease phenotypes (see below). And, although it is simplest to think of the factors as diffusible likePDGF-B from the beads, certain features of the process (e.g., the temporal aspect of radial SMC differentiation patterning) could be accounted for by membrane-bound signals transmittedradially via a sequential, contact-dependent (''bucket al., and Majesky, 2012 ;Mandereld et al., 2012 ). Implications of the Radial Patterning Model for ArterialDiversity and Disease Other blood vessels have different radial structures than the PA. For example, at the end of gestation, the left common carotidartery (CCA) and aorta have two or three times the number ofsmooth muscle layers as the PA, whereas the left anterior de- scending coronary artery has just a single layer ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and 6A-6D; data not shown). An analysis of SMA expression and fate mapping of the developing left CCA showed that, as forthe PA, the CCA wall forms radially from the inside-out ( Figures 6F-6J) with inner layer cells migrating radially to contribute to outer layers ( Figures 6 K and 6L). An initial clonal analysis of the descending thoracic aorta indicates that, here too, inner layercells migrate radially to contribute to outer layers (A. Misra, L.D., and D.M.G., unpublished data). Thus, despite their differingradial structures, at least some of the same cellular mechanisms are used to form them. An appealing idea is that vessel-specic modulation of the radial patterning signal(s) and response thresholds generatethe observed differences in vessel wall sizes and structures (Figure 6 E), and we further speculate that dysregulation of such signaling contributes to the many vascular diseases inwhich the radial structure of the vessel wall is altered and SMCs become highly proliferative and motile ( Owens et al., 2004 ), resembling the developmental state ( Figure 6 O). Indeed, conditional activation of PDGFR- b, which presumably extends and levels the PDGF signaling gradient, markedly increases the thickness of the aorta ( Olson and Soriano, 2011 ;Figures 6 M and 6N), and targeted deletion of the PDGF-B matrix retention motif also alters vessel walls ( Lindblom et al., 2003 ;Nystro \u00a8m et al., 2006 ). It must now be a priority to identify the full set of signals that control induction of cell layers and radial invasion,and how generally these pathways and cellular mechanisms op- erate in development and diseases of each arterial wall. Suchpathways and mechanisms would be appealing therapeutictargets for arterial wall diseases and regenerative strategies. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Animals All experiments with animals were approved by the IACUC at Stanford or YaleUniversity School of Medicine. CD1 mice (Charles Rivers Laboratories) wereused for wild-type analysis. PDGF-B (+//C0)(Leve \u00b4en et 2003 ),PDGFR- b(+//C0)(Soriano, 1994 ),PDGFR- b-Cre (Foo et al., 2006 ),SMMHC-CreERT2(Wirth et al., 2008 ), Rainbow (Rb) Cre reporter ROSA26RRb(Red-Horse et al., 2010 ), and PDGFR- bJ(Olson and reporter strains ROSA26RlacZ,ROSA26RYFP, and ROSA26RmTmGwere obtained from Jackson Laboratories. The Tbx4-Cre andTbx4-CreERT2transgenes are lung mesen- chyme-specic and induce expression of Cre reporters beginning at E10and throughout the undifferentiated mesenchyme as well as in mesenchymalderivatives, including airway and vascular SMC, but not in airway epithelium(M.K., P. Bogard, and M.A.K., unpublished data; Menke et al., 2008 ); construc- tion and use of the transgenes and transgenic mice will be detailed elsewhere(M.K., P. Bogard, and M.A.K., unpublished data). Immunohistochemistry and Histology Embryos and lungs from timed pregnancies, in which noon of the day ofvaginal plug detection was designated E0.5, were dissected and xed in4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 0.5-2 hr. For hematoxylin and eosin xed tissue was dehydrated in methanol, and parafn sectionswere prepared and stained using standard protocols. For b-galactosidase activity stains, xed whole mount lungs were incubated with bromo-chloro-indolyl-galactopyranoside (X-gal, Sigma). For immunostains of whole mountlungs (Metzger et al., 2008 ), xed lungs were dehydrated serially into 100% methanol and stored at /C020 /C14C.

To mark nuclei, tissue was stained with DAPI (1:1,000). The positions of PA wall cells were identied as located in layer 1 (L1; i.e., the cell layer adjacent to the ECs), 2 (L2; the next radial layer), or adventitia(A; the following outer layer). The identity of layer A as adventitia should beconsidered provisional because these cells did not detectably express Sca1orPtch1 lacZ, the extant adventitial markers that label adventitia of select regions of specic vessels starting late in embryogenesis (Majesky et al.,2011 ;Passman et al., 2008 ). For quantication of marker expression proles in PA wall layers, longitudinal confocal sections and vascular wall cells ineach section were assessed as described below for phosphohistone cellcounts. L1 cells of each section were numbered sequentially around thevessel and subdivided into groups of ve contiguous cells. One cell wasrandomly selected from each group, and the marker expression was deter-mined for this L1 cell as well as for the adjacent cell in L2 and the successiveadjacent cell in A. In Situ Hybridization Dehydrated whole mount lungs were rehydrated into PBS with 0.1% Tween-20, permeabilized with proteinase 4% PFAwith 0.2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma). were then hybridized at with digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled (Roche) probes overnight, incubated chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-30-indolyphosphate p-toluidine salt (NBT-BCIP) was used to detect signal, and lungs were then washed extensively withTBS/0.1% Tween-20/10 mM EDTA. Tissue sections (10-20 mm) were hybrid- ized and stained as described (Red-Horse et al., 2010 ). Phosphohistone Cell Counts and Mitotic AxisWhole mount lungs stained with antibodies against pH3, SMA, PDGFR-band with DAPI were imaged by confocal fluorescence microscopy in the coronal plane to obtain longitudinal optical sections of the left PA extendingfrom the carina to the rst left lateral secondary airway branch (LL1). Thelongitudinal section of the left PA closest to the carina was the starting sectionand subsequent sections were collected every 12-20 mm(/C241 cell length) until the vessel crossed LL1. Sections were considered adequate for analysis if thelumen and at least four cell lengths in the longitudinal axis of the vessel wall were visible. Sections containing wall cells visualized on previous sections were omitted. Vascular wall cells were identied as located in L1, L2, or A.This analysis included cells on the medial or lateral aspect of the blood vesselwall but excluded cells at the proximal or distal end of each vessel sectionbecause the layer these cells reside in could not be reliably determined.Between the carina and the LL1 airway branch, the left PA curves dorsal-ventrally, precluding denitive assignment to a specic wall layer at theproximal or distal end of each coronal section of the vessel. For mitotic axiscounts, cells were only included in the analysis if they were pH3 +and the division axis of the mitotic gure was clearly determinable. The long axis ofthe PA endothelium was dened as the longitudinal axis, and mitotic angleswere scored relative to this axis and binned into three groups: longitudinal,radial, or 45 /C14. However, no mitotic gures in were the delity of this approach for assigningaxis of division (data not shown). Clonal Analysis SMMHC-CreER T2mice were crossed to either ROSA26RmTmGorROSA26RRb (''Rainbow'') mice. A single limiting dose (0.8-1.2 mg, see below) of tamoxifen(Sigma) was injected intraperitoneally into dams at E11.5 to induce recombina-tion. Embryos were allowed to continue development and then analyzed atE13.5-18.5. For mGFP labeled clones, whole mount lungs were dissectedand stained with an anti-GFP antibody in whole mount preparations forE13.5-14.5 lungs, or in cryosections for E17.5-18.5 lungs. Each GFP +cell was counted and its specic location and layer in the left PA wall recorded,except for cells at the proximal or distal end of each vessel section, whichas described above could only be assigned to a ventral or dorsal locationbut not a specic layer of the PA wall. For Rainbow clones, tissue was cryosec-tioned and imaged using fluorescent lters for each fluorophore, and each marked cell was scored for color (i.e., Cerulean, mOrange, or mCherry), posi- tion, and specic layer of the PA wall. To nd conditions of very sparse and, ideally, single cell (i.e., clonal) marking of left PA SMCs we titrated down the dose of tamoxifen injected atE11.5 in preliminary experiments. In the range used here (0.8-1.2 mg), wefound that /C2448% of SMMHC-CreER T2,ROSA26RmTmG/+embryos had marked cells in the PA and the rest had none. Lower doses (0.6 mg) gaveno GFP +PA SMCs at E13.5 (n = 6), whereas higher doses (1.5 mg) yielded more embryos (83%) with marked cells and more GFP+cells in the marked embryos. To help ensure clonal labeling, we excluded from analysis anyembryos in which there was not at least one SMMHC-CreER T2, ROSA26RmTmG/+littermate lacking marked cells. At standard doses of tamox- ifen (0.8-1.2 mg) in SMMHC-CreERT2, ROSA26RRb/+embryos (n = 63), the PA SMCs were almost always unlabeled (59%) or labeled with just a single color(38%), conrming clonality, and only very rarely (n = 2) were multi-color (i.e.,polyclonal; 3%). In these experiments, the labeled parent cell is always an inner layer SMC because expression of SMC markers (and presumably SMMHC-CreER T2)i s limited to this layer until three days after tamoxifen injection (i.e., E14.5; seeFigures 2 and S2), and analysis of clones marked at E11.5 and analyzed at E13.5 showed labeling of only inner layer cells. In embryonic studies from othergroups utilizing highly active promoters driving CreER , the time window for recombination of Cre reporters is 6-48 hr following a single injection of high-dose tamoxifen (1.5-3.0 mg) (Hayashi and McMahon, 2002 ;Nakamura et al., 2006 ). We found that injection of our standard dose of tamoxifen (1.2 mg) at E10.5, instead of E11.5, resulted in no marked left PA SMCs in SMMHC- CreER T2,ROSA26RmTmG/+embryos at E13.5 (n = 8). Because SMMHC protein (and presumably SMMHC-CreERT2) is expressed in the PA SMCs at E11.5 (Figure S2 F), these ndings suggest that the outer time limit for recombination in the left PA following a 1.2 mg injection is 1 day or less. Although there wereno marked PA SMCs in these experiments, there were marked airway SMCsbecause expression of SMC markers, presumably including SMMHC-CreER T2, occurs earlier in the airways than in the vessels. Similarly for SMMHC-CreERT2, ROSA26RRb/+embryos from dams injected with tamoxifen at E11.5, PA SMCs were almost always unlabeled or labeled with a singlecolor, but airway SMCs invariably contained marked cells of all three colors (Figure S3 F). Lung Cultures and PDGF Bead Implantation Agarose beads (Af-Gel Blue Gel, 100-200 mesh, Bio-Rad) were washedwith sterile PBS three times for 30 min each, and then incubated for onehour with a disulde linked homodimer of PDGF-B (R&D, 200-300 ng/ml) in PBS or with PBS alone for control beads ( Furuta et al., 1997 ). After incubation, the beads were briefly washed and then implanted in the mesenchyme of freshly harvested E12 whole mount lungs by making asmall incision in the lung mesenchyme with flame-polished tungsten needlesand carefully positioning the bead. Lungs were cultured in DMEM12 with10% FBS on 0.4 mm lters (Millipore) at the air liquid interface for 24-72 hr in a 5% CO2 incubator, then xed with 4% PFA and immunostained asabove. Lungs that did not grow normally in culture were excluded fromanalysis.

In this review, we shall consider how much of the complexity of the pattern is already present at the beginning of this process in the fertilized egg? Since the early part of this century, embryol- ogists have recognized that the eggs of many organisms contain localized regions of cytoplasm that direct the for- mation of specific parts of the embryonic pattern (Wilson, 1928). However, it is only in the case of Drosophila that the molecules responsible for these activities have been identified. Thanks largely to the use of genetic ap- proaches, it is now known that four localized maternal signals define the basic organization and polarity of the two major embryonic axes. Thus, these signals not only specify cell states, but also provide a prepattern for subse- quent development. Although Drosophila is probably un- usual in the extent to which its pattern formation is con- trolled by maternal cues, many of the molecular processes involved have counterparts in other systems. More im- portantly, the characterization of these signals has also provided useful paradigms for the study of a variety of developmental phenomena, such as localized determi- nants, induction, and morphogen gradients. The purpose of this review is to describe our current understanding of how the four maternal signals establish positional informa- tion in the Drosophila embryo, and to discuss the molecu- lar properties of each system. The Drosophila egg is produced over a period of about 3% days in the ovary of the female (Figure l), and upon fertilization, develops extremely rapidly to form a larva after 24 hr. During the early stages of embryogenesis, the zygotic nuclei divide, without forming cells, to give rise to a syncytial blastoderm embryo (Figure 1). By 3 hr of development, the nuclei have been surrounded by cell membranes to form the cellular blastoderm, and gastrula- tion begins soon afterward. Although the organization of anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes first becomes apparent in the region-specific cell movements of gastrula- tion, the basic prepattern of both axes has already been established in the syncytial blastoderm by the localized expression of zygotic pattern genes. The anterior-posterior prepattern is formed by the spa- tially regulated transcription of the gap genes. While the identities of all of the gap genes that control head develop- ment are not yet completely clear, the embryo contains expression domains of huckebein, tailless, giant, hunch- back, Krijppel, knirps, giant, tailless, as one posterior 1985; et al., 1990; Weigel et al., 1990). The first localized gene expression along the dorsal-ventral axis also occurs at this time, with the activation of twist and snail in the ventral nuclei of the embryo and dpp and zen in the dorsal regions (Rushlow et al., 1987a; St Johnston and Gelbart, 1987; Thisse et al., 1987; Leptin and Grunewald, 1990). All of these genes, with the exception of dpp, encode DNA-binding proteins that are believed to act as transcrip- tion factors, and it is the interactions between these factors and the genes that they regulate that lead to the subdivi- sion of the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes into different regions (Rosenberg et al., 1986; Boulay et al., 1987; Padgett et al., 1988; Pig- noni et al., 1990). The initial activation of these genes in their discrete spatial domains is controlled by the four lo- calized maternal signals, and in this way these determi- nants establish the polarity and organization of both axes. The genes discussed above are expressed in the zygotic nuclei of the embryo, but the maternal signals and the components required for their localization and function are synthesized during oogenesis. A number of genetic screens have been performed to isolate maternal-effect mutations that affect the embryonic pattern (Gans et and Wieschaus, 1989). Females that carry such mutations lay normally shaped eggs that develop into embryos with cuticular pattern defects. Several important conclusions can be drawn from the results of these screens. First, the number of genes that are specifically involved in the establishment of positional information in the egg is quite small. About 30 genes have been identified so far, and the total number is unlikely to be much higher than this. Second, the two body axes are established indepen- dently, as mutations either affect the anterior-posterior pattern orthe dorsal-ventral pattern, but never both. Third, the number of embryonic phenotypes observed is much smaller than the number of genes. This means that the genes can be assigned to four classes on the basis of which parts of the embryo they affect. The common pheno- type produced by mutations in the genes of one class indicates that these genes act in a common pathway to specify a discrete part of the embryonic pattern. One class, consisting of the dorsal group genes and cactus, is responsible for specifying the whole of the dor- sal-ventral axis of the embryo (Figure 2). Loss-of-function mutations in the ten dorsal group genes and gainaf- function cactus mutations result in completely dorsalized embryos, in which all cells follow a dorsal developmental pathway (Figure Se), while loss-of-function CaCtUS m&i- COURSE BOOK PAGE 139Cdl 202 follicle cells FOLLICLE aocyte (-12 h, n nurse cells EGG ( 0 h) SYNCYTIAL BLASTODERM (1.5 h) syncytial blastodem?

Oogenesis Early Drosophila At the beginning of oogenesis, a germline stem cell divides four times to produce 16 cells that remain connected by cytoplasmic bridges. One cell in the cluster migrates to the posterior and develops into the oocyte, while the 15 remaining cells become the anterior nurse cells. The nurse cell-oocyte complex is surrounded by somatic follicle cells, and by stage 10 of oogenesis (top panel) these cells have migrated to cover the developing oocyte. As the cocyte matures, the nurse cells contract and expel their contents into the oocyte, while the follicle cells secrete the egg coverings. Both of these cell types degenerate at the end of oogenesis. When the mature egg (second panel) is laid, it is surrounded by the vitelline membrane and the chorion, and is filled with yolky cytoplasm. The only visible specialized region of cytoplasm is the pole plasm at the posterior pole, which is yolk-free, rich in mito- Maternal Somatic alleles lead to the development of ventralized embryos (Figure 39 (Ni.isslein-Volhard et al., 1980; Anderson et al., 1985a; and Wieschaus, Roth et al., 1991). The specification of the anterior-posterior axis requires three classes of maternal genes: the anterior, posterior, and terminal genes (see Figure 2) (Niisslein- Volhard et al., 1987). Mutations in the anterior class lead to a reduction or loss of head and thoracic structures, posterior group mutations cause abdominal deletions, and the terminal class (torso group) is required for the develop ment of the unsegmented ends of the embryo, the acron and telson (Figures 3b-3d). To a first approximation, these three gene systems act independently and additively to define discrete parts of the pattern; the parts of the pattern removed by mutations in one system are the only regions that are unaffected when both of the other two systems are absent (Figure 4). This complementarity between the regions defined by each of the maternal signals only breaks down in the most anterior region of the embryo, the acron, which requires both the terminal and anterior systems. In the absence of the anterior signal, the terminal system directs the formation of an anterior telson, usually the posterior-most structure of the embryo. Localized Cytoplasmic Determinants The first demonstration that the Drosophila egg contains chondria, and contains the polar granules. After fertilization, the zy- gotic nuclei go through a series of rapid cleavage divisions in the interior of the egg. After nine divisions the majority of the nuclei have migrated to the cortex to form the syncytial blastoderm (middle panel). At this stage, the 3-4 nuclei that have entered the pole plasm at the posterior pole form polar buds, which will give rise to the pole cells, the precursors of the germline. The rest of the nuclei divide four more times at the surface of the egg before being surrounded by cell membranes to give rise to the ~66tXl cells of the cellular blastoderm (fourth panel). Soon after cellularfzation is complete, gastrulation (bottom panel) be- gins with the invagination of the presumptive mesoderm through furrow, the formation of the posterior midgut invagination that contains the pole cells, and the appearance of the head fold.

In addition to a posterior group phe- notype, mutations in these loci also affect the shape of the egg. PAGE 140Review: Drosophila Embryonic Pattern and Polarity 203 Figure 3. The Cuticular Patterns of Wild-Type and Mutant Embryos (a) wild-type, (b) anterior (bicoic), (c) ments in which the egg is pricked and a small amount of cytoplasm is allowed to leak out (Frohnhlifer et al., 1986; Sugiyama and Okada, 1999). Pricking at the anterior pole leads to the development of larvae with head and thoracic defects that closely resemble those produced by muta- tions in the anterior gene bicoid. When the pole plasm is removed from the posterior pole, the telson, the most posterior region of the embryo is not affected, but the re- sulting larvae show abdominal deletions that are very simi- lar to those produced by posterior group mutations. These results indicate that the anterior and posterior systems produce localized signals that reside at the corresponding poles of the egg. This conclusion is supported by the re- sults of transplantation experiments; defects produced by bicoid mutations can be rescued by transplanting anterior cytoplasm into the anterior pole of mutant eggs (Frohn- hijfer and Niisslein-Volhard, 1986). In a similar fashion, the transplantation of wild-type pole plasm can rescue the defects caused by posterior group mutations and Niisslein-Volhard, How- ever, in this case, although the donor cytoplasm must be taken from the posterior pole, the best rescue is observed when this cytoplasm is injected into the presumptive ab- dominal region. Thus, the pole plasm contains a localized posterior determinant that acts more anteriorly to deter- mine the formation of the abdomen. The pole plasm also contains a second determinant, which directs the forma- tion of the pole cells (Illmensee and Mahowald, 1974) but COURSE BOOK PAGE 141Cdl 204 a ANTERIOR POSTERIOR TERMINAL b blcoid 3 ,,,,,.,....\" I APT -PT A-T AP- Figure 4.

The removal of cytoplasm from other regions of the egg does not cause specific pattern defects, nor is it possible to mimic the phenotypes engendered by mutations in the dorsal or ter- minal systems in this way. As described below, these ma- ternal systems do not produce localized cytoplasmic deter- minants, but instead act through signals that are localized outside the egg cell. A combination of genetic and classical embryological experiments have defined the basic properties of the four Drosophila maternal systems. One surprising aspect of these four systemsisthat, although they all serve tocontrol the localized activation of zygotic pattern geneexpression, at a molecular level they act through very different path- ways. This is reflected in the fact that with one exception, the genes involved in the production of one maternal signal are not involved in any of the other systems (see Figure 2). The Anterior Determinant, bicoid For a maternal system to act to specify part of the embryonic pattern it needs to have two properties. First, some component of the system must be localized to provide the initial asymmetric signal. Second, this signal must directly or indirectly lead to the production of an active transcription factor that regulates zygotic target genes. In the case of the anterior system, both of these roles are performed by the products of the gene bicoid. bicoid RNA is localized in the cytoplasm at the anterior pole of the egg (Figure 5A), and is translated after fertiliza- tion to produce an anterior to posterior concentration gra- dient of bicoid protein that extends over the anterior two- thirds of the embryo (Figure 58) (Frigerio et al., 1986; Berleth et al., 1988; Driever and Nfisslein-Volhard, 1966a; St Johnston et al., 1989). This gradient is believed to arise from diffusion from the anterior source coupled to a uni- form rate of degradation. Two lines of evidence demon- strate that the bicoid protein gradient is sufficient to deter- mine the polarity and pattern of the anterior half of the embryo. As the number of maternal copies of bicoid is increased, more RNA and protein are produced, resulting in an expansion of the bicoid protein gradient toward the posterior. This change in the shape of the gradient pro- duces a corresponding change in the anterior fate map, as monitored by the positions of gap and pair-rule gene expression domains at the blastoderm stage and the posi- tion of the head fold at gastrulation (Driever and Niisslein- Volhard, 1988b; Struhl et al., 1989). A more dramatic dem- onstration is provided by RNA injection experiments (Figure 8) (Driever et al., 1990). Injection of in vitro synthe- sized RNA into other positions in the embryo results in a protein gradient that directs the formation of ectopic head and thoracic structures, with the most anterior pattern ele- ments forming closest to the site of injection. These results show that anterior structures form in regions with high concentrations of bicoid, while lower concentrations lead to the development of more posterior pattern elements. In this way the shape of the gradient defines the polarity of the anterior pattern. The presence of a homeodomain within the bicoid pro- tein suggests that bicoid is a sequence-specific DNA- binding protein that determines the anterior pattern by di- rectly regulating zygotic target genes (Frigerio et al., 1986; Berleth et al., 1988). One target is the gap gene hunch- back, which is required for the development of the thorax and part of the head, and is first transcribed at the syncytial blastoderm stage in a large anterior domain that extends to about 50% egg length (see Figure SC) (Bender et al., 1987; Lehmann and Niisslein-Volhard, 1987b; Tautz et al., 1967). This early expression is dependent on the bicoid protein gradient, as it does not form in bicoid mutant em- bryos and it expands posteriorly when the bicoid gene dosage is increased (Figures 7a-7d) (Schroder et al., 1988; Tautz, 1988; Struhl et al., 1989). There are a number of bicoid-binding sites in the hunchback upstream region, including three strong and three weak sites in the 300 bp immediately 5' to the major start site of zygotic transcrip- tion (Driever and Niisslein-Volhard, 1989a). This region of hunchback can direct the bicoid-dependent expression of a reporter gene in the anterior half of the embryo, indicat- ing that bicoid acts as a transcriptional activator 1988; BOOK PAGE 142Review: Drosophila Embryonic Pattern and Polarity 205 A Figure 5.

(F) knirps expression (only the posterior domain of knips expression is dependent upon the posterior system). Niisslein-Volhard, 1989b). It is unlikely that bicoid requires any specific cofactors to activate transcription, since these hunchbacksequences are also able to mediate the bicoid- dependent activation of reporter genes in both yeast and Drosophila tissue culture cells (Driever and Ntisslein- Volhard, 1989a; Struhl et al., 1989). Since hunchback is only required for the development of part of the region defined by the anterior system, the bicoid protein gradient must also regulate other zygotic target genes. Indeed, the dependence of the anterior fate map upon the shape of the protein gradient indicates that bicoid acts as a morphogen, with different threshold con- centrations defining a number of anterior positions. A model for how this may occur is suggested by analysis of the ability of different bicoid-binding sites to direct the embryonic activation of a basic promoter (Driever and Niisslein-Volhard, 1989b). Four tandem copies of a high affinity bicoid-binding site direct expression in a large ante- rior domain that is approximately the same size as the wild-type hunchback domain (Figure 78). In contrast, four low affinity sites direct expression in a much smaller ante- rior region (Figure 79. Adding extra binding sites to either construct leads to a large increase in the level of expres- sion, but only causes a slight posterior shift in the extent of the domain. Thus, promoters with low affinity bicoid- binding sites require high concentrations of protein to be activated and are therefore expressed in small anterior regions, while high affinity sites can bind bicoid at lower concentrations and direct expression in larger domains. Although there is still some doubt whether the threshold concentration for activation by bicoid depends solely on the affinity of the bicoid-binding sites in the genes that it normally regulates (Struhl et al., 1989) it is clear that the bicoid gradient can activate target genes in anterior do- mains of various sizes. In this manner, the smooth protein gradient can be converted into a number of discrete do- mains of zygotic gene expression, which define several anterior positional values. The model proposed above requires the existence of at least one additional zygotic gap gene (gene X in Figure 9; Driever and Ntisslein-Volhard, 1989a), which is directly regulated by bicoid and which is expressed in a smaller COURSE BOOK PAGE 143Cdl 206 a bicoid RNA figure 6.

No gene has been proven to fulfil both these criteria, but there are several promising candidates. Mutations in orthodenticle, empty spiracles, and buttonhead delete partially overlapping, ad- jacent regions of the head, just anterior to the region af- fected by hunchback(Dalton et al., 1989; Cohen and Jur- gens, 1990; Finkelstein and Perrimon, 1990). Each of these genes is required very early in development, as the mutants alter the expression patterns of other zygotic pat- tern genes at the cellular blastoderm stage. Thus, in terms of their phenotypes and their positions in the zygotic hierar- chy, these loci behave like gap genes. empty spiracles and orthodenticle encode homeodomain proteins that are first expressed in a single stripe near the anterior end of the syncytial blastoderm embryo (Dalton et al., 1989; Fin- kelstein and Perrimon, 1990). Furthermore, the positions of these stripes depend upon the bicoid gradient, since both shift posteriorly when extra maternal copies of bicoid bicoid hunchback transcription GRADIENT PROMOTER PA'ITERN a 0 l- b C 2 L d 4 L e Figure 7.

Another possible target for bicoid regulation is the anterior domain of giant expression, whose position is also dependent on the shape of the bicoid protein gradi- ent (Eldon and Pirrotta, 1991; Kraut and Levine, 1991a). However, it still remains to be shown that bicoid protein binds to the regulatory regions of any of these genes to activate their transcription directly. Without knowing how many genes are regulated by the bicoid gradient, it is not possible at present to determine how many different threshold concentrations of bicoid are used to determine the anterior pattern, The Posterior Determinant Although superficially similar, the posterior system differs in several major respects from the anterior. First, while the COURSE BOOK PAGE 144Review: Drosophila Embryonic Pattern and Polarity 207 initial localized signal at the posterior pole is a maternal RNA, the product of this RNA does not regulate zygotic gene expression directly. Instead, the posterior determi- nant acts by preventing the translation of a transcription factor encoded by an ubiquitous maternal RNA. Second, unlike bicoid, which plays an instructive role in anterior pattern formation, the posterior signal only plays a permis- sive role. The pole plasm at the two local- ized signals: the posterior determinant, which controls the development of the abdomen, and a second signal that directs the formation of the pole cells. Mutations in all posterior group genes result in abdominal deletions, but the majority of these genes (cappuccino, spire, staufen, oskar, vasa, valois, tudor, and mago nashi) are also re- quired for the formation of the pole plasm, with its charac- teristic polar granules, and for pole development al., 1991). Mutations in this class of posterior group gene cause their abdominal phenotype not by preventing the production of the poste- rior determinant, but by failing to localize this signal to the posterior pole (Sander and Lehmann, 1988; Lehmann and Niisslein-Volhard, 1991). These genes are all required for the localization and stepwise assembly of the polar gran- ules during oogenesis, and the formation of these granules seems to be a prerequisite for the localizationof the poste- rior determinant. The two remaining posterior group genes, nanos and pumilio, are specifically involved in the determination of the abdomen and are not required fortheformation of polar granules or pole cells (Lehmann and Nijsslein-Volhard, 1987a, 1991). No posterior determinant activity is detect- able at any stage in nanos mutant ovaries or eggs, indicat- ing that nanos is required for the synthesis of this signal (Lehmann and Niisslein-Volhard, 1991). In fact, nanos ac- tually encodes the posterior determinant, and nanos RNA is highly concentrated in the pole plasm of the freshly laid egg (see Figure 5D) (Wang and Lehmann, 1991). Injection of in vitro synthesized nanos RNA into the abdominal re- gion of mutant embryos restores normal abdomen devel- opment, while the injection of a control RNA containing a frame shift mutation has no effect on the phenotype. Furthermore, the wild-type RNA can also rescue the ab- dominal deletions produced by all other posterior group mutations. Since nanos activity is required in the region where the abdomen will form, while the RNA is localized at the posterior pole, either nanos protein, or some activity dependent on nanos, must move to this more anterior re- gion. The distribution of the nanos product is not yet known, but the simplest model would be that the protein diffuses from its posterior source to form a posterior-ante- rior gradient in a similar way to that in which the bicoid gradient forms. pumilio mutations seem to prevent suffi- cient nanos activity from reaching the presumptive abdom- inal region, as mutant embryos do not form complete abdo- mens, although they have posterior determinant activity in their pole plasm (Lehmann and Niisslein-Volhard, 1987a). It is possible that thepumilio product facilitates the anterior movement of nanos. Alternatively, pumilio could enhance the amount of nanos activity produced at the posterior pole. The gap genes knirps and giant are both required for the formation of the abdominal pattern and are expressed in adjacent domains in the syncytial blastoderm embryo, in the region where the abdomen will develop (Mohler et al., 1989; Pankratz et al., 1989). This expression is dependent on nanos, since neither domain is formed in posterior group mutant embryos (Rothe et al., 1989; Eldon and Pir- rotta, 1991; Kraut and Levine, 1991 a). However, although nanos provides the localized signal that initiates abdomen formation, it does not directly regulate these zygotic gap genes. Instead, nanos appears to prevent the expression of a transcriptional repressor encoded by maternal hunch- back RNA. We have already described how the bicoid gradient activates zygotic hunchback expression in the anterior of the embryo. hunchback is also transcribed dur- ing oogenesis to give rise to a maternal transcript that is uniformly distributed in the mature egg (Schriider et al., 1988; Tautz, 1988; Tautz and Pfeifle, 1989). During the cleavage stages of embryogenesis, this maternal RNA is degraded in the posterior half of the embryo, and hunch- back protein, which is first synthesized during this period, shows a similar distribution (see Figure 5E) (Tautz, 1988; Tautz and Pfeifle, 1989). In nanos mutants, both the RNA and the protein are present throughout the embryo, indi- cating that an early function of nanos is to repress maternal hunchback expression in posterior regions. Using two dif- ferent experimental approaches, Hiilskamp et al. (1989) and Struhl (1989) have caused the ectopic expression of hunchback protein in the posterior half of the embryo, in the presence of wild-type nanos activity. In both cases, this posterior hunchback protein blocks the formation of the abdomen and results in a phenotype that is very similar to that produced bynanos mutations (Hiilskamp et al., 1989; Struhl, 1989). Since hunchback contains six zinc finger domains and binds DNA, it is likely that it prevents abdo- men formation by directly repressing the expression of knirps and giant (Tautz et al., 1987; StanojeviC et al., 1989; Treisman and Desplan, 1989). These results indicate that an essential role of nanos is to prevent the posterior ex- pression of hunchback. In fact, this is the only role that nanos plays in the determination of the abdomen. Using mitotic recombination to generate hunchback mutant germline clones, it has been possible to produce embryos that lack both maternal hunchback activity and nanos ac- tivity (Hiilskamp et al., 1989; Irish et al., 1989; Struhl, 1989). These embryos develop normal abdomens and give rise to fertile adults. Thus, in the absence of maternal hunchback, nanos is not required for normal development. The protein sequence of nanos shows no strong similari- ties with other known proteins and therefore does not sug- gest how the nanos product might regulate the expression of hunchback. However, since nanos activity affects the distribution of both maternal hunchback RNA and hunch- back protein, it probably acts at the level of the RNA (Tautz, 1988; Tautz and Pfeifle, 1989). This has now been con- firmed by the identification of a short sequence that occurs COURSE BOOK PAGE 145Cell 208 twice in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the hunch- backtranscript that is required for nanos regulation (Whar- ton and Struhl, 1991). The presence of both copies of this sequence is sufficient to confer nanosslependent poste- rior repression on a heterologous transcript. Ectopic nanos activity seems to suppress anterior development by a simi- lar mechanism. When nanos RNA is injected into the ante- rior of the egg, or is mislocalized there genetically by Bicaudal-D mutations, the bicoid protein gradient never forms (Wharton and Struhl, 1989; Wang and Lehmann, 1991). bicoid RNA is degraded prematurely in these eggs, but it is still present at the time that the protein would normally be translated. The B'UTR of bicoid RNA contains a similar sequence to the two found in hunchback RNA, and this suggests that nanos regulates the expression of both of these transcripts by preventing their translation, and that the degradation of these RNAs is probably a con- sequence of this translational control (Wharton and Struhl, 1991). The surprising result that nanos is not required in the absence of maternal hunchback raises several important questions. First, if nanos is not supplying an instructive signal, how is the abdominal pattern generated? The an- swer to this question lies in the long-range interactions between the gap genes. In maternal hunchback nanos double mutant eggs, the anterior and terminal signals are still present and lead to the activation of zygotic hunchback in the anterior of the embryo and the terminal gap genes at both ends. hunchback protein isdistributed in agradient extending into the posterior half of the embryo that can specify the anterior and posterior borders of Kriippel ex- pression and the anterior border of theknirpsdomain (Gaul and Jackie, 1989; StanojeviC et al., 1989; Hijlskamp et al., 1990). It is likely that the protein product of the terminal gap gene tailless also forms a gradient from the posterior of the embryo that specifies the posterior borders of knirps and giant expression (Pankratz et 1990; Eldon and Pirrotta, 1991; Kraut and Levine, 1991 a). The correct positioning of the gap gene expression do- mains is further refined by regulatory interactions between Krsippel, knifps, and giant(Pankratz et 1991a, 1991b). In this way, the initial asymmetric signals produced by the ante- rior and terminal systems, the secondary gradients of gap gene products and the interactions between thegapgenes are sufficient to define the order of expression of the ab- dominal genes Kruppel, knirps, and giant, without an in- structive signal from the posterior determinant. Since the abdomen forms normally in the absence of maternal hunchback and nanos, it is hard to imagine why this system has evolved. Although it acts by a very different mechanism, the posterior determinant restricts maternal hunchback expression to the same anterior region as that in which bicoid activates zygotic hunchback (see Figures 5C and 5E). Thus, the anterior and posterior determinants both define the anterior region of the embryo in the same way. It is possible that the posterior system is the more primitive of the two and originally subdivided the anterior- posterior axis on its own, while bicoid evolved more re- cently and took over this role. This does not explain why a functional posterior system has survived, despite the presence of bicoid. One possibility is that the existence of maternal hunchbackand nanos allows the anterior expres- sion of hunchback protein to begin slightly earlier and in- creases the amount of protein produced; these two effects may help to speed up embryogenesis and make pattern formation a more error-free process. nanos has also evolved the ability to regulate bicoid translation, which is more difficult to explain, as nanos is restricted to the posterior half of the wild-type embryo, while bicoid RNA is localized to the anterior pole. The Terminal System As is the case for the anterior and posterior systems, the defects produced by several terminal and dorsal group mutations can be rescued by cytoplasmic transplantations or RNA injections (Santamaria and Niisslein-Volhard, al., 1987; Klingler et al., 1988; Strecker et al., 1989). However, these results differ in two important respects. In general, the rescuing activities are not localized within the donor eggs, and the polarity of the resulting patterns is not af- fected by the site of transplantation into the recipient em- bryos. There are two partial exceptions to these general- izations (see below), but they do not alter the basic conclusion that the terminal and dorsoventral systems do not produce cytoplasmic determinants that are localized in the unfertilized egg. Instead these two systems share a number of features that indicate that they provide posi- tional information to the egg by a quite different mecha- nism. In both the terminal and dorsal groups, at least one gene is required in the somatic cells of the female, and not in the germline (Stevens et al., 1990; Stein et al., 1991). These genes are most probably expressed in the somatic follicle cells that surround the developing oocyte. In addi- tion, one of the germline genes in each system encodes a transmembrane protein that is uniformly distributed in the egg membrane and that shows homology to other cell surface receptor proteins (Hashimoto et al., 1988; Sprenger et al., 1989). Gain-of-function alleles have been recovered in both of these putative receptor genes and result in the opposite phenotype to loss-of-function muta- tions (Anderson et al., 1985a; Klingler et al., 1988). These alleles are believed to produce mutant receptors that are constitutively active everywhere in the egg. Although our information on the pathway for either sys- tem is incomplete, drawing on data from each, one can propose the following scheme. In each system, one of the genes that is required in the soma is active in a subpopula- tion of the somatic follicle cells, leading to the production of a localized signal that is deposited outside the egg in the vitelline membrane or in the perivitelline space, a fluid- filled region between this membrane and the egg mem- brane. After fertilization, the asymmetric signal provided by the follicle cells causes the release of a localized ligand that binds to the receptors in the egg membrane. The receptors then transmit this signal to the inside of the egg, activating a signal transduction pathway that results in COURSE BOOK PAGE 146Review: Drosophila Embryonic Pattern and Polarity 209 the local activation of a transcription factor that regulates zygotic pattern gene expression. In the terminal system, the product of the gene torso probably acts as a receptor for an extracellular signal that iS produced at the two poles of the egg. The torso protein sequence contains an N-terminal signal peptide, a puta- tive transmembrane domain, and a region that show significant homology to the tyrosine kinase domains of other receptors (Sprenger et al., 1989). This structure strongly suggests that torso encodes a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. Although torso RNA is synthe- sized during oogenesis, the protein is not translated until after fertilization, when it localizes to the egg membrane (Casanova and Struhl, 1989). As predicted by experiments showing that torso-rescuing activity is not localized along the anterior-posterior axis, both the RNA and protein show a uniform distribution (Klingler et al., 1988; Casanova and Struhl, 1989; Strecker et al., 1989). In addition to loss-of-function torso mutations, which cause a typical terminal group phenotype (see Figure 3d), there exist three gain-of-function alleles that have the op posite effect (Klingler et al., 1988; Strecker et al., 1988). Embryos laid by mutant females develop normal terminal structures but have defects in the segmented regions of the pattern (Klingler et al., 1988). The gain-of-function seg- mentation defects are suppressed in embryos that are also mutant for the terminal gap genes, tailless and huckebein, the zygotic targets for the terminal system (Klingler et al., 1988; Strecker et al., 1988; Weigel et al., 1990). This indi- cates that these phenotypes are most probably due to the ectopic expression of tailless and huckebejn in the middle of the embryo, which leads to the repression of central gap genes such as Kriippel. It is believed that the gain-of- function torso alleles encode mutant receptors with consti- tutive tyrosine kinase activity independent of the binding of ligand. The existence of torso gain-of-function mutations has made it possible to determine which of the other maternal torso group genes act upstream of torso in the production of the ligand and which act downstream in the signal trans- duction pathway inside the egg, In double mutant combi- nations, mutations in the upstream genes should have no effect upon the ligand-independent gain-of-function phe- notype, but those in downstream genes should suppress this phenotype and should instead cause the loss of termi- nal structures. These experiments have placed torso-like, trunk, fs(l)Nasrat, and fs(l)pole hole upstream of torso and I(l)p hole downstream (Ambrosio et al., 1989; Stevens et al., 1990). I(l)p Ambrosio et al., 1989). has been implicated in the signal transduc- tion pathways of a number of vertebrate receptor tyrosine kinases, but its exact role is unclear (reviewed by Li et al., 1991; Rapp, 1991). The demonstration that mutations in &af cause terminal pattern deletions and suppress the torso gain-of-function phenotype indicates that the raf ki- nase is an essential component of the torso signal trans- duction pathway. It is likely that there are still SEWeral genes that act downstream of torso that have not yet been identi- field, including the transcription factor at the end of this pathway (gene Y in Figures 2 and 9) that activates tailless and huckebein in the terminal regions of the embryo. The genes upstream from torso are responsible for the production of the localized extracellular ligand at the two ends of the egg. Since the developing oocyte is sur- rounded by about 1000 somatic follicle cells, the simplest way that such a ligand might be localized is if it is produced by terminal subpopulations of these cells. Germline clones of trunk, fs(l)Nasmt, and fs(l)pole hole give rise to em- bryos that display atypical torso group phenotype, indicat- ing that these genes are required in the nurse cell-oocyte complex (Perrimon and Gans, 1983; Schiipbach and Wieschaus, 1988). In contrast, torso-like is required in the soma and not in the germline (Stevens et al., 1990). Ste- vens et al. (1990) have produced follicle cell mosaics that are mutant for torso-like and have found that torso-like clones of only 8-30 cells surrounding the posterior pole of the egg can produce a terminal phenotype at just the posterior end of the resulting embryo. Thus, torso-like is specifically required in the terminal follicle cells, strongly suggesting that these cells produce the localized terminal signal. It is not known whether torso-like or the three germ- line-dependent upstream genes actually encode the Ii- gand for torso. torso-like may produce an inactive ligand that is anchored in the vitelline membrane until after fertil- ization when it is released by the activities of the germline genes. Alternatively, the follicle cell signal may lead to the local activation of one of the germline products, which then acts as a ligand for torso. The Dorsoventral System The dorsoventral pathway is the most complex of the four maternal systems in Drosophila, since it requires the largest number of genes and specifies positional informa- tion along the whole of the dorsoventral axis. However, the basic features of this pathway are very similar to those of the terminal system. An initiaf ventral signal outside the egg leads to the production of a localized ligand for a receptor in the egg membrane. The localized activation of the receptor then initiates a signal transduction pathway inside the egg that culminates in the spatial regulation of zygotic gene expression. Like torso, the dorsal group gene To// encodes a transmembrane protein that is believed to act as the receptor for a localized external signal (Hashi- moto et al., 1988, 1991). The Toll protein sequence con- tains an N-terminal signal peptide, a putative transmem- brane domain, and two distinct regions of homology to other genes. The extracellular portion of the protein con- tains two blocks of leucine-rich repeats followed by cysteinecontaining domains that are similar to those found in a number of other receptors, including both the a and p chains of the human platelet glycoprotein lb (a receptor for von-Willebrand factor and thrombin), while a stretch of 217 amino acids in the intracellular domain of Toll shares 28% amino acid identity with the intracellular portion of the interleukin-1 receptor (Lopez et al., 1988; McFarland et al., 1989; Keith and Gay, 1990; Vicente al., 1990; Soppet et al., 1991; Squintoet al., 1991; Gay and Keith, 1991; Schneider et al., 1991). These homologies strongly support a model in which Toll acts as a receptor COURSE BOOK PAGE 147Cdl 210 for a localized external ligand, and transduces this signal to the interior of the egg. Consistent with this view, Toll is expressed everywhere in the egg membrane at the syncy- tial blastoderm stage, the time at which the upstream sig- nal is known to be active (Hashimoto et al., 1991). While To// loss-of-function mutations produce a dor- salized phenotype, dominant gain-of-function alleles re- sult in the development of embryos that are ventralized (Anderson et al., 1985a; Schneider et al., 1991). Several of these mutations are believed to produce Toll protein with constitutive activity that is partially independent of the extracellular signal (Schneider et al., 1991). Using the same approach described for the terminal system, these gain-of-function alleles can be used to position the other dorsal group genes relative to To// in the pathway: gastrulation-defective, pipe, nude/, windbeutel, snake, caster, and spLItz/e all function upstream of Toll in the pro- duction of the localized signal; tube, pelle, and dorsal (dl) act downstream, in the signal transduction pathway inside the egg (Anderson et al., 1985a; K. V. Anderson, personal communication). Genetic experiments have suggested that the product of the gene dorsal lies at the end of the signal transduction pathway that begins when Toll is activated on the ventral side of the embryo. Only dorsal mutations produce a et al., 1991). Thus, dorsal functions downstream of cachs, while all other dorsal group genes do not. Second, only in the case of dorsal can a localized rescuing activity be found in transplantation experiments, although this localization only appears at the syncytial blastoderm stage (Santamaria and Niisslein- Volhard, 1983). Finally, unlike all other dorsal group genes, loss-of-function dorsal mutations show a dominant effect (Niisslein-Volhard et al., 1980). At 29%, dM+ fe- males produce embryos that do not develop mesoderm, showing that the determination of the most ventral cell fates in the embryo requires higher levels of dorsalactivity than the lateral and dorsal regions. The exact role of dorsal has only become evident as a result of molecular experiments. These show that the ventral signal transmitted by Toll regulates the differential nuclear localization of dorsal protein. The resulting gradi- ent of dorsal protein in the nuclei then controls zygotic gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Both dorsal RNA and protein are synthesized during oo- genesis and are uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm of the freshly laid egg (Steward et al., 1988; Roth et al., 1989; Rushlow et al., 1989; Steward, 1989). When the zygotic nuclei reach the cortex of the egg after the ninth cleavage division, the protein becomes highly concentrated in the nuclei on the ventral side of the embryo and is depleted from the ventral cytoplasm (Roth et al., 1989; Rushlow et al., 1989; Steward, 1989). At more lateral levels, the nu- clear and cytoplasmic concentrations of dorsal are approx- imately equal, while the protein is excluded from the nuclei on the dorsal side. The formation of the concentration gra- dient of dorsal in the syncytial blastoderm nuclei seems to be entirely regulated at the level of nuclear localization, since a uniform distribution of protein is observed when the nuclear membranes break down during mitosis (Roth et al., 1989). Using different combinations of mutants in the genes that act upstream of dorsal, it is possible to produce a wide range of dorsalized, lateralized, and ventralized pheno- types. In all cases, the distribution of dorsal in the nuclei correlates perfectly with the expression patterns of the zygotic dorsoventral genes and the final cuticular pheno- type (Roth et al., 1989). For example, in loss-of-function dorsal group mutations, dorsal protein is excluded from the nuclei at all positions around the dorsoventral axis, the dorsal zygotic genes zen and dpp are expressed every- where while the ventral genes twist and snail are not ex- pressed, and all the cells adopt a dorsal fate (Figures 8i- am). In the strongest ventralizing mutants, the converse is seen. dorsal protein localizes to all of the nuclei, which leads to the repression of zen and dpp and the activation of twist and snailall around the circumference of the embryo, and all cells follow a ventral pathway of development (Fig- ures 8a-8d). Finally, in mutant combinations that produce a lateralized phenotype, dorsal protein is evenly distrib- uted between the nuclei and the cytoplasm, and neither the dorsal nor ventral zygotic genes are expressed in the main part of the embryo (Figures 8e-ah). These observa- tions provide strong evidence that the nuclear concentra- tion of dorsal determines the dorsoventral pattern by con- trolling the expression of the zygotic genes. The sequence of dorsal indicates that it is likely to en- code a transcription factor. The N-terminal half of the pro- tein shares approximately 50% amino acid identity with the N-terminal portions of the proto-oncogene c-reland the p50 and ~85 subunits of the transcription factor, NF-KB, and this region of similarity includes both the DNA-binding and dimerization domains of these proteins (Steward, 1987; Ghosh et al., 1990; Kieran et al., 1990; Nolan et al., 1991; Ruben et al., 1991). More direct evidence that dorsal acts as a transcription factor comes from studies on the zygotic genes that are regulated by the dorsal protein gra- dient. The dorsal-dependent repression of zen expression in the ventral and lateral regions of the embryo requires a repression element in the zen promoter that contains a number of dorsal-binding sites (Doyle et al., 1989; Ip et al., 1991). The upstream sequences that control the ventral expression of twist also contain two clusters of dorsal- binding sites, and these regions can mediate the dorsal- dependent activation of transcription in tissue culture cells (Thisse et al., 1991; Jiang et al., 1991; Pan et al., 1991). Interestingly, dorsal protein binds more strongly to the sites in the zen repression element in vitro than it does to sites in the twist upstream region (lhisse et al., 1991; Jiang et al., 1991). Therefore, dorsal may control the spatial do- mains of zygotic gene expression in a similar way to that proposed for bicoid. Genes like zen with high affinity dorsal-binding sites can bind dorsal protein when it is pres- ent at the low concentrations found in lateral nuclei, while higher concentrations are needed to bind to the lower aff in- ity sites of genes such as rwisf, and this will restrict the binding to the ventral nuclei of the embryo. One important additional property of dorsal is that it seems to function as both a transcriptional activator and repressor, activating COURSE BOOK PAGE 148Review: Pattern and Polarity 211 u-dorsal a- twist a-zen Figure 9. The Regulation of Zygotic Transcription by the Nuclear Concentration of dorsal Protein The uniform distribution of dorsal protein and the resulting expression of the zygotic target genes, twist and zen, are shown for three phenotypes.

Data from Roth et al. (1999). twist ventrally and repressing zen in the ventral and lateral nuclei. At present, we have no information on why the binding of dorsal can have these two opposite effects, but this probably depends on the context of the binding sites and on the other factors that bind in the region (Pan et al., 1991). The homology between dorsaland the ~50 and p65 sub- units of NF-KB is especially intriguing since the activity of NF-KB is also regulated at the level of nuclear localization. In several cell types NF-KB is found in the cytoplasm in an inactive form in which p65 is bound to IKB (Baeuerle and Baltimore, 1966a, 1966b; Nolan et al., 1991). Upon activa- tion of the cells by a number of signals, IKB is released from the complex, allowing the active NF-KS to translocate to the nucleus. There is strong evidence that cactus per- forms a homologous function to IKB in the Drosophila dor- soventral system (Roth et al., 1991). The sequence of cac- tus is actually very similar to that of IKB (R. Geisler and C. N.-V., unpublished data), and cactus loss-of-function mutations produce an increase in dorsal nuclear locali- zation, resulting in a ventralized phenotype, which one would expect if cactus encodes a cytoplasmic anchor for dorsal protein. In vitro experiments have shown that the phosphorylation of IKB by cellular kinases can activate NF-KB (Ghosh and Baltimore, 1990). While a similar pro- cess may occur in the dorsoventral pathway, it is unlikely that the ventral activation of dorsal nuclear localization occurs solely through the modification of cactus. The ven- tralized embryos produced by even the strongest cactus mutations are still polar, and although more dorsal protein localizes to the nuclei, the ventral nuclei still contain higher levels of protein than those on the dorsal side (Roth et al., 1991). It is possible that none of these mutations com- pletely abolishes cactus activity, but it seems more likely that the release of dorsal protein from cactus inhibition is insufficient to produce the highest levels of dorsal nuclear localization. This suggests a model in which the dorsal group genes activate dorsal nuclear localization indepen- dently of cactus, perhaps by modifying dorsal directly. It is interesting to note that one of the signals that can lead to the activation of NF-KB is interleukin-1 (Shirakawa and Mizel, 1969; Shirakawaet al., 1969). As mentioned above, the interleukin-1 receptor is homologous to Toll, raising the possibility that both receptors use similar intracellular signaling pathways to regulate nuclear localization. The two dorsal group genes tube and pelle are required for the transmission of this activating signal in Drosophila, but although tube has been cloned, its sequence does not suggest what role it may play (Letsou et al., 1991). The discovery that Toll encodes a transmembrane re- ceptor that is localized in the egg membrane has led to the hypothesis that dorsoventral polarity is induced from outside the egg by a localized ligand for Toll, and that the production of this external signal depends upon the seven dorsal group genes that act upstream from Toll in the hier- archy. Two recent results have provided strong support for this model (Stein et al., 1991). First, three of the upstream dorsal group genes-pipe, nude/, and windbeutel-are re- COURSE BOOK PAGE 149quired in the soma and not in the germline. The similarity with torso-like in the terminal system strongly suggests that at least one of these genes is required in a specific population of ventral follicle cells. Second, transplantation experiments have shown that the perivitelline fluid that surrounds the egg contains a polarizing activity. When this fluid is taken from To/r donors and is injected into the perivitelline space of pipe, node/, or windbeutel recipients, it induces the formation of ventral pattern elements. Fur- thermore, the site of injection determines the polarity of the resulting embryos. These experiments show that mu- tations in the soma-dependent genes lead to the formation of eggs with no intrinsic polarity, lending support to the view that these genes are required for the production of the initial asymmetric signal. No polarizing activity is found in the perivitelline fluid of donors that carry a wild-type copy of Toll, but wild-type To// is required in the recipients. These observations suggest that the rescuing activity corre- sponds to the Toll ligand. In the presence of wild-type Toll, the ligand will bind to theToll protein in the egg membrane of the donors and will therefore no longer be free in the perivitelline fluid for transplantation. The four other genes upstream of To// are germline de- pendent (Seifert et al., 1987; al., 1988; Stein et al., 1991). While gastrulation-defective cannot be rescued by cytoplasmic transplantation and has a temperature- sensitive period that begins during oogenesis, caster, snake, and sptiizle can be rescued by the injection of RNA or cytoplasm into mutant embryos (Anderson and NOss- lein-Volhard, 1984; Seifertet al., 1987). This indicates that the activities of these genes are not required until after fertilization. snake and caster have been cloned and their sequences indicate that they both encode serine prote- ases that and Spierer, 1988; Chasan and Anderson, 1989). It is likely that spiifzle also encodes a product that is se- creted into the perivitelline space, since the dorsalization produced by mutants in any of these three genes can be rescued by the transplantation of perivitelline fluid (Stein and Ntisslein-Volhard, 1992). Similar transplantation ex- periments have shown that caster, snake, and spiifzle are required for the production of the polarizing activity that is believed to correspond to the ligand for Toll. For example, perivitelline fluid from easfer To// donors cannot generate polarity in pipe recipients, even though there is no Toll protein present in the donors to sequester any ligand pro- duced. While all the evidence so far supports the idea that the ventral follicle cells provide the initial asymmetric signal in the dorsoventral pathway, the relationship between this signal, the germline-dependent activities, and the Toll li- gand remains unclear. The expression of the somatic genes in the ventral follicle cells could result in the synthe- sis of a localized inactive ligand for Toll that is released after fertilization as a result of the activities of the germlinedependent genes, perhaps by proteolysis. Alter- natively, the follicle cell signal may lie upstream of the germline-dependent activities. For example, this signal might actually be in the form of aventral site that stimulates the local activation of one of the serine proteases, which then acts through a protease cascade to generate the li- gand. A number of gain-of-function easfer mutations pro- duce ventralized or lateralized embryos, and these pheno- types presumably arise because the spatial distribution of the Toll ligand has been altered (Chasan and Anderson, 1989; Jin and Anderson, 1990). It is hard to explain how caster mutations can alter the localization of this ligand unless wild-type easter activity is also localized. Thus, it has been suggested that the easter serine protease is normally activated only in the ventral region of the perivitel- line space, while the gain-of-function alleles encode prod- ucts that are released from this spatial regulation. Al- though there are other possibilities, this interpretation strongly favors the second model, in which the follicle cell signal controls the ventral activation of the germline prod- ucts such as easter. Delayed Induction and Limited Diffusible Ligands Although the components of the dorsoventral and terminal systems are different, the basic features of the two path- ways are quite similar. One particularly striking aspect of both is that the initial asymmetric signals seem to originate from the follicle cells that surround the developing egg. Thus, the formation of ventral and terminal pattern can be seen as an inductive process, in which the follicle cells provide an inducing signal to specific regions of the egg. Unlike classical inductive events, there is a large temporal delay between the production of the inducing signal and the response. In fact, the inducing cells have degenerated long before the fertilized egg responds to the localized signals. Several lines of evidence indicate that the egg does not receive the ventral or terminal signals until after fertilization. For example, mutations in many of the germ- linedependent terminal and dorsal group genes can be rescued by cytoplasmic transplantation or RNA injection into the syncytial blastoderm embryo (e.g., Anderson and Niisslein-Volhard, 1984; Klingler et al., 1988). Further- more, torso, the receptor for the terminal signal, is not translated during oogenesis, demonstrating that the egg is not competent to respond until after egg deposition (Cas- anova and Struhl, 1989). In contrast, the contribution of the follicle cells must occur during oogenesis, as these cells die at the end of this process. Since mature eggs can be held in the female for up to 15 days before being fertilized, the localization and activity of the follicle cell signals must remain stable for long periods of time be- tween their synthesis during oogenesis and their activation after the egg has been laid. After fertilization, the localized follicle cell signals result in the production of ligands for the two receptors in the egg membrane. Unlike their precursors during oogenesis, these ligands appear to be freely diffusible in the perivitel- line space. For example, perivitelline fluid taken from the dorsal side of To/r embryos contains the same amount of polarizing activity as fluid taken from the ventral side (Stein et al., 1991). These results create an apparent paradox. It is clearly important that the receptor, Toll, is only activated on the ventral side of the embryo, yet the polarizing activity seems not to be localized. The most likely solution to this problem is that Toll limits the diffusion of its own ligand. In COURSE BOOK PAGE 150Review: Drosophila Embryonic Pattern and Polarity 213 wild-type embryos all of the ligand probably binds to Toll on the ventral side of the egg, but the ligand cannot be sequestered in the absence of Toll and remains free to diffuse into the dorsal perivitelline fluid. This model re- quires that the amount of ligand is limited, and that Toll is present in excess. In situations where the amount of Toll is reduced, the polarity of the embryo can be determined by the localization of Toll rather than the external signal. When To/I+ cytoplasm or To//RNA is injected into the dorsal side of To//- embryos, the site of injection determines where ventral structures will form (Anderson et al., 1985b). Since there is no Toll protein on the ventral side of these eggs, the ligand can diffuse in the perivitelline space until it binds to the dorsal patch of Toll that is synthesized from the injected RNA. This leads to the activation of dorsal protein nuclear localization on the dorsal rather than ven- tral side, and results in the development of embryos with reversed polarity. A similar phenomenon has also been observed in the terminal system. The injection of torso RNA into the middle of torso- recipients leads to the suppression of segmenta- tion, and sometimes causes the development of telson structures in the middle of the embryo (F. Sprenger and C. N.-V., unpublished data). The induction of this pheno- type depends upon the presence of ligand and the ab- sence of endogenous torso with a wild-type extracellular domain. These results indicate that when there is no torso at the poles to bind the ligand, this activity can diffuse to the middle of the egg and activate any wild-type torso protein that is expressed there. For an inductive process to be spatially controlled, either the inducer or the compe- tence to respond must be localized. In the dorsoventral and terminal pathways, it is normally the inducing activity that is localized, but in the exceptional cases described above this situation is reversed and it is the distribution of responsiveness that determines the final pattern. Morphogen Gradients Both bicoid and dorsal proteins form gradients in the nuclei of the syncytial blastoderm embryo, and the shapes of these gradients correspond well with the resulting pat- terns. However, to prove that either molecule functions as a morphogen, a third criterion must be satisfied. A morpho- gen has been defined as a \"factor which can evoke more than one positive response from the responding tissue\" (Slack, 1991). Thus, the presence of the morphogen alone must be sufficient to generate at least two different re- sponses or cell states with different threshold concentra- tions. In general, it is hard to be certain that all of the observed ceil states are determined directly by the abso- lute concentration of the morphogen, and that they do not arise as a result of secondary interactions. For example, even though retinoic acid behaves as a morphogen when applied to the chick limb bud, one cannot rule out that it acts as a local inducer of one cell state and that the pattern is actually formed by a series of cell-cell interactions or by a gradient of a second molecule (Brockes, 1991; Noji et al,, 1991; Wanek et al., 1991). One way to exclude the possibility that different cell states are being generated by subsequent cell-cell interactions or secondary gradients is to expose single cells to various concentrations of the factor in question (Green and Smith, 1990; Simeone et al., 1990). Since the maternal signals in Drosophila act before cellularization has occurred, this approach cannot be used for bicoid and dorsal. Instead, it is possible to generate a uniform concentration of either protein across the whole axis. Since all the nuclei will therefore be exposed to the same concentration of morphogen, they should all re- spond in the same way, thereby eliminating any effects of secondary interactions between different regions. In the dorsoventral system, a number of different mutant combi- nations give rise to apolar phenotypes in which all nuclei contain the same concentration of dorsal protein (Roth et al., 1989). At a molecular level, two different thresholds can be distinguished for the response to the dorsal protein concentration, leading to the specification of three cell states (Figure 8). When no dorsal is present in the nuclei, zen and dpp are expressed everywhere. Above the first threshold, zen and dpp are repressed, but twist and snail are not activated; above the second threshold, zen and dpp remain repressed, and twist and snail are turned on. Using various combinations of dorsal group and cactus alleles, it is possible to generate two additional apolar later- alized phenotypes (Roth et al., 1991). This suggests that the dorsal nuclear concentration gradient actually defines five different positional values. At present, the three apolar lateralized phenotypes cannot be distinguished by their patterns of zygotic gene expression, and it is possible that there is another zygotic target of dorsal regulation that has not yet been identified. To create a uniform distribution of bicoid protein, it is necessary to prevent the localization of both bicoid and nanos RNA.% since localized nanos activity will inhibit the translation of bicoid in the posterior of the embryo. This can be done by using exuperantia staufen double mutant embryos and varying the number of maternal copies of bicoid. In this way, it has been possible to show that bicoid also acts as a morphogen, with at least two threshold con- centrations (W. Driever and C. N.-V., unpublished data). The Localization of the Maternal Signals Although the way that the four maternal signals generate polarity in the embryo is quite well understood, much less is known about how this asymmetry initially arises during oogenesis, when the maternal signals themselves are lo- calized. In the case of the terminal and dorsoventral sys- tems, this seems to be a question of how different follicle cell populations are defined, and most probably involves cell-cell interactions. The determination of follicle cell states along the dorsoventral axis also seems to require signaling between the oocyte and the follicle cells. The somadependent torpedo mutations in the Drosophila epi- dermal growth factor receptor homolog cause all of the follicle cells to adopt a ventral fate, leading to the produc- tion of ventralized egg coverings and embryos (Schiip- bath, 1987; Price et al., 1989; Schejter and Shilo, 1989). Two other genes involved in this signaling, K70 and gur- ken, are required in the germline, and K70 RNA accumu- lates specifically around the oocyte nucleus, which lies on the dorsal side of the cell (Wieschaus et al., 1978; Haenlin COURSE BOOK PAGE 151Cdl 214 et al., 1987; Schiipbach, 1987). These observations have led to a model in which the oocyte nucleus produces a signal that diffuses to the nearby follicle cells and binds to the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor homolog, thereby inducing the cells to adopt a dorsal fate. The anterior and posterior determinants must be local- ized by quite a different mechanism, since these are both maternal RNAs that reside in the cytoplasm at opposite ends of the oocyte. The localization of bicoid RNA is medi- ated through the 3' untranslated region of the transcript and occurs in several steps, in which the RNA first local- izes to the apical regions of the nurse cells before being transported into the oocyte and binding to the cortex at the anterior pole (Macdonald and Struhl, 1988; St Johnston et al., 1989). The initial phase of this process is disrupted by exuperanfia mutations, while swallow mutations cause the RNA to fall off the cortex in the middle of oogenesis (Ber- leth et al., 1988; Stephenson et al., 1988). Before the egg is laid, bicoid RNA is released from the cortex into the anterior cytoplasm, where the product of the sfaufen gene seems to be required to hold the RNA in position (St John- ston et al., 1989). staufen protein is concentrated in the anterior cytoplasm in the same region as bicoid RNA, sug- gesting that staufen may bind to the RNA to prevent its diffusion (St Johnston et al., 1991). While almost nothing is known about the mechanisms that direct the localization of bicoid RNA, this process does require microtubules, and this raises the possibility that the RNA is transported along the microtubule network (Pokrywka and Stephen- son, 1991). Localization to the posterior pole seems to be an even more complicated process. One reason for this is that it is not just nanos RNA that is localized, but all the compo- nents of the pole plasm as well. The first identified mole- cules to reach the posterior pole are staufen protein and oskar RNA (Ephrussi et al., 1991; Kim-Ha et al., 1991; St Johnston et al., 1991). These are followed by vasa protein, cyclin B RNA, and toward the end of oogenesis, nanos RNA and pole cell-determining activity (Illmensee et al., 1976; Hay et al., 1988; Whitfield et al., 1989; Lasko and Ashburner, 1990; Wang and Lehmann, 1991). The pole plasm forms in a stepwise manner, in which the compo- nents that localize early are required for the subsequent localization of those that arrive later in oogenesis (Whitfield et al., 1989; Hay et al., 1990; Lasko and Ashburner, 1990). Although the majority of these molecules may accumulate in the pole plasm by binding to other components that have already been localized, this model cannot account for the localization of the first molecules to reach the posterior pole, most probably staufen protein and oskar RNA. Sev- eral lines of evidence suggest that staufen protein associ- ates with oskar RNA at the anterior of the oocyte and the two are then transported around the cortex to the posterior pole as a complex, in a process that requires the activities of two other posterior group genes, cappuccino and spire (Manseau and et al., 1991; Kim-Ha et al., 1991; St Johnston et al., 1991). Thus, StaUfen protein seems to associate with both oskar and bicoid RNAs, mediating the transport of the former to the posterior end of the egg and anchoring the latter at the anterior end. Although many of the genes that are involved in localiza- tion in the oocyte have now been identified, the cell biology of these processes is not well understood, nor is it known how the anterior and posterior ends of the egg are first defined as the sites for localization. The polarity of the oocyte probably depends upon the geometry of the nurse cell-oocyte complex, which is initially established near the beginning of oogenesis when the oocyte migrates to the posterior of the follicle. However, recent results suggest that the follicle cells are also involved in defining the two ends of the oocyte, since the reduction of the activities of the neurogenic genes Notch and Della in these cells frequently results in the localization of bicoid RNA to the posterior as well as the anterior pole (Ruohola et al., 1991). Conclusions The results described in this review show that we now have a fairly clear picture of the elegant way that the four maternal signals generate asymmetry in the Drosophila embryo (Figure 9). However, our understanding of the pro- cess by which positional information is transmitted from one generation to the next is still incomplete, as so little is known about the origin of asymmetry in the oocyte. While the general organization of each pathway is proba- bly correct, there are still many steps that are poorly char- acterized. It is also likely that several genes that play a part in these pathways have not yet been identified, and we have already mentioned a couple of examples where the existence of an additional gene has been proposed. Al- though a few maternal-specific genes may have been missed in the screens for maternal-effect mutations, a po- tentially much larger class of unidentified genes are those that are required in the zygote as well as in the mother, since mutations in these genes cannot be tested for maternal-effect phenotypes if the mutants die before adult- hood. One such gene is I(l@ole hole, the Drosophila raf homolog. This gene is required at several developmental stages, and its maternal role was only discovered by mak- ing germline clones (Perrimon et al., 1985; Ambrosio et al., 1989). pumilio, cactus, and torpedo also mutate to zygotic lethality, but some alleles of these genes are viable, allowing their identification in maternal screens. Since it is possible to make sense of each maternal system without invoking more than a few additional components, it is un- likely that there are a large number of unknown zygotic lethal genes that play a specific role in these processes. Although there are still many unsolved questions, the early development of Drosophila is probably better under- stood than that of any other organism. In this context it is worth considering how relevant the information gained in Drosophila is to other developmental systems. It is clear that many of the later developmental processes in flies have counterparts in vertebrates (see the reviews by In- gham and Martinez Arias, 1992; McGinnis and Krumlauf, 1992, this issue), but the early events that we have de- scribed are probably less general. Drosophila is unusual in that both major body axes are already defined in the COURSE BOOK PAGE 15227;~~: Drosophila Embryonic Pattern and Polarity DORSO-VENTRAL (pipe, ndl, wbl, Figure 9. A Summary of the Major Steps in Each of the Four Maternal Pathways The distributions of gene products shown in parentheses are hypothetical, as are gene X in the anterior system and gene Y in the terminal system. COURSE BOOK PAGE 153Cdl 216 unfertilized egg, and the first steps of pattern formation occur in a syncytium. However, many of the individual steps in these maternal pathways do resemble processes that occur during the development of other organisms and are therefore of more general relevance, such as RNA localization, signal transduction, induction, and the regula- tion of nuclear localization. Drosophila axis formation also provides an excellent model for studying several important pattern-forming mechanisms. For instance, bicoid and dorsal provide the best-characterized examples of morphogen gradients. The gradient of bicoid protein forms by diff usion in a syncy- tium from a localized RNA source. This is unlikely to be a common mechanism for setting up morphogen gradients, since in most other developmental systems pattern forma- tion takes place after cells have formed, and cell mem- branes will limit the movement of intracellular factors. The dorsoventral system may provide a more useful paradigm. In this case, the first gradient probably forms outside the egg in the extracellular space, and this leads via a signal transduction pathway to a graded intracellular response, the formation of the dorsal nuclear gradient. One of the most surprising aspects of axis formation in Drosophila is that although all four maternal systems result in the region-specific activation of zygotic pattern genes, each achieves this by a unique pathway. While two of the initial asymmetric signals are localized outside the egg, the other two are found in the egg cytoplasm as localized RNAs. Furthermore, the spatial control of transcription arises in a number of different ways. The bicoid protein gradient regulateszygotic gene expression directly, nanos seems to function as a repressor of a repressor, and dorso- ventral polarity is generated by the control of nuclear local- ization. It is known that localized maternal determinants play a role in the development of many organisms, but it is only in Drosophila that such molecules have been identified and characterized. The variety of mechanisms found in this one system suggests that maternal determi- nants may turn out to constitute a diverse collection of molecules that can regulate embryonic development in very different ways.

Taken together, the available evidence suggests that the gap gene expression don~irLs are mainly controlled by mutual repression.
