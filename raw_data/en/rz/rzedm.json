It is also known as Votrient. It is a treatment for: advancedkidney cancer (renal cancer) - some types of soft tissue sarcoma How does pazopanib work? Pazopanib is a type of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Tyrosine kinases are proteins which act as chemical messengers (enzymes) in cells. There are a number of different tyrosine kinases and they stimulate cancer cells to grow. Pazopanib blocks a number of these proteins and is called a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor (multi TKI). It stops cancer cells forming blood vessels that they need in order to grow. This is called anti angiogenesis treatment. How do you have pazopanib? You take pazopanib as tablets with a glass of water. You take the capsules at least 1 hour before you eat or 2 hours afterwards. You take the capsules at the same time each day. Whether you have a full or empty stomach can affect how much of a drug gets into your bloodstream. You should take the right dose, not more or less. Talk to your healthcare team before you stop taking or miss a dose of a cancer drug. Don't take extra tablets if you forget to take a dose. Just take your next dose at the usual time.
