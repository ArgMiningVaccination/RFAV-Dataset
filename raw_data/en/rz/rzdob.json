Closeted gays and ksbisms in fact choose to be in denial, he says, until \"they can't stand it any tnore\" and decide to come out, to themselves and to others. To the right wing, they are **choosing to bc ga/'. But to them \u2014 to us \u2014 we are choosing to bcjree, Bruce is tight* as usual. But what about choosing whether to come out as bisexual, or remain in denial? Bisexuaiity is still as misunderstood So why can't we explore these ideas? Why and stereotyped in the gay community as ho- do wc need to believe that there are only two nKksexuality is in the strai^t worid. Yet bi- choices on the menu of human sexuality? sexuality explains so much that is confusing Most straights are too homophobic (brain- about human sexuality and sexual identity. washed from birth) to accept the possibility It is common to hear people say that they are that same sex desire might be a normal part of confused because they have feelings forpeopie bodi of thc opposite and the same gender. \"I strug^ed with my identity and finaUy decided that because I'm attracted to people of the same sex, I must be gay (or lesbian),\" they say, ^nodng those other feelings and the fact that there is a third identity opdon. It is also common to hear \"ex-ga3?s\" claim that 6uth in G<3d has enabled them to tum to hetetosexuallty and find o|^x)site-scx partners. But what if it wasn't faith in God, but rather thetrowninnate(C7od-given, ifyou like) ability to be attracted to both genders? Maybe some ofthe **ex-gays\" that controvetsial researcher Robert Spitzer said he talked to wete actually duekss bisexuals. What if sexual identity is far more complex and fluid than almostanyone,gayorstra^ht, is willing to ^Amii? What if most human beings arc bom bisexual? Someday science may prove that, as Kinsey suggested, human sexuality is on a continuum, from exclusively heterosexual on one end to exclusively homosexual on the other, with the majotity ofpeoplc falling some\u00ad where in between \u2014 sofnewhere in the Bl Zone. That wouldn't surprise this reporter in the least. And if that's the case, it would put us queers (excuse me, non-heterosexuals) ia the major\u00ad ity. Bisexuaiity would be the mainstream, the norm. That acknowledgement would trans\u00ad form $ociet3r's ideas about sexual idendty so profoundly that all labels, definidons and as\u00ad sumprions would be subject to recall. It would mean an end to homophobia and stereotypes. It would mean a label-free worid where people could love and live as they pleased, instead ofa worid divided into Team A (the stricdy straight majority, or \"the good guys\"), and Team B (the \"abnormal minority\"). Hmm... a lot of us could get to like that kind of world. human nature. To heterosexuals, bisexuals are denying their \"true\" (i.e. straight) natures. As for lesbians and gay tnen, it seems that too many of us are still hung up on the stereotype ofbisexuals as \"sitting on the fence\" and denying their \"true\" (i.e. gay) natures. Bisexuals as potendal though polidcally-aware bisexuals adamandy refuse to accept heterosexual identity and privilege, even when they are in committed relationships with people ofthe opposite sex. Another common stereotype is that bi\u00ad sexuals are promiscuous in a way that gay men and lesbians aren't. This reporter spoke re\u00ad cendy with a man who said he was confused about whether he was straight or gay, but he knew he couldn't be bi because hc wanted a cotrmutted, cording to this weird stereotyp>e, bis continu\u00ad ally jump from one short term relationship with a person ofthe same sex to another with someone ofthe opposite sex, and so on. How did this idea get started? Why should we believe that bisexuals don't form committed, longterm reladonships with thc people thcy love, just as many lesbians and gay men try to do? What are we so uptight about? To bisexuals themselves, their \"true\" na\u00ad ture is neither gay nor straight. It is bisexmai, meaning they are attracted to individual hu\u00ad man beings rather than to a particular gender. Whatever label we choose for ourselves, as Bruce ViUanch pointed out, the real choice comes when we dedde whether to accept and affirm that identity, or to remain in denial. We shouid aU be able to make the choice to be free without fear ofbeing stereotyped and misun\u00ad derstood by anyone. And someday, in a label-free worid, we won't have to make the choice at aU. We wiU be free to be the sexual, loving people we are. The Empty Closet ' / ' i *,;.'. ^ S ' '.

PRESS* 179 Adandc Avenue, Roch\u00ad ester, NY 14607-1255 Way to show pride, Rochester! From Our Executive Director By Robert Gelder During the week of July 7 throughjuly 15, the Greater Rochester community cdebrated gay pride. And we showed our pride through neariy 20 different events that cdebrated our diver\u00ad sity and uniqueness as a community. With your help and that of many individuals throughout Westem New York, we were able to make this week thc best ever! I've heard comments about the fact that the Pride Celebrations we offer in Rochester can\u00ad not compare to the likes of Toronto or New York City. Well, that's very true and they most likely never wiU. Rochester is a much smaUer dty and community overaU. We won't see the Ukes of 850,000 people attending our parade each year. But that doesn't mean it can't grow and l>e even stronger in the future. What I don't think people reaUze is the work and effort that goes into bringing aU these events to the Rochester community. If it weren't for a few dozen dedicated volunteers, none ofour events would happen. So ifyou'd Uke to see something different next year, get involved. If you'd like to see something new next year, get involved. The possibiUties are endless and Umited only by the resources and number oi people involved. Do remember this though, Roches teroffers some of die largest Pride events in Westem and Upstate New York. This is something to be very PROUD aboud Our community de\u00ad serves kudos for the work that it does. And you have something more to be proud about for Uving here! I wanted to share with you some words that I put forth for a recent \"Speaking Out\" artide in the Democrat &c Chronide relative to cd- ebradfig pride. It is as foUows: *'Some questions you might ask arc * \"Why cdebrate gay pride?\" * \"Why does thc to Oaunt its sexuaUty?\" * \"Why can't the gay community just leave weU enough alone?\" I hope to answer some of those questions for you or at least leave you with more to ponder. One could equate celebrating gay pride with celebratingsome other cul tural hoiiday or event Uke Oktoberfest The Getman community alongwith many non-Gertnans come together to celebrate German culture through music, food^nd camaraderie. The gay community does thc same thing. It's not a matter of flaunting our sexuaUty for thc sake of doing so. It is a common miscon\u00ad ception that being gay is just about sex. That would mean being heterosexual is just afcK>ui sex. People contribute to society as hoUstic beings, not solely defined by their sexuaUty. However, it is our sexuaUty that has separated gays from the remainder of the conmiunity, just Uke many people's skin color or religion. It is our pride in who we are after surviving years of violence and piersecution, as weU as being marginaUzed as second class dtizens or \"untouchables,\" that propels us forward to claim out identity pubUdy. Also, it's not a matter of leaving weU enough alone. For every day that it continues to be legal to discriminate gainst someone in hous\u00ad ing and employment because they atc gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, we need to bc visible. Living in a state that does not offer equal protection under thc law, we need to bc visible. Living In a country that does not recog\u00ad nize or value our personal rdationships, wc need to be visible. If we didn't celebrate our gay pride and unite as a conununity, we would continue to be disctimiiuited against, tnarginaUzcd, and even tnutdered for being who wc are. Issues of hate crimes, school violence and degradation wiU continue to be in the headUncs of every com\u00ad munity until such dme thatwe aU accept others for who they are. The gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community contributes to all induding art, medidne, education, gov\u00ad ernment, finance, cngineerii^^iukd the service industries. Just as one can choose to attend Oktoberfest or not, one can choose whether or not to attend a pride event. However, we still owe our feUow drizens thc respect, the right, and thc opportunity to cdebrate what makes them unique.\" Let's show our Pride throughout the year. We have much to celebrate and to bc thankful fori Thanks for the a irfiiiiiiiiliii.tfaapofciffid from p. I filling up with a large and diverse crowd.

According to thc DScC, \"The charges allege that Kovacevich choked (his victim), beat his head repeatedly against a floor and kkked him in the head, neck and torso white wearing sneakers.\" The slaying occurred on Kovacevich's 27th birthday. Kovacevich's address has been given as Ward St. (between North Clinton and the start of Joseph Ave.), and also as Monroe Ave., although it is believed that he had a home in Delton, Mich. Kovacevich had served dme for a previous felony, robbing a Pizza Hut, and also had a record of petty larceny, assault and escape. At the sentencing, the slightly built Kovacevich seemed pale, as he stood qui\u00ad etly before the judge in a beige prison uniform with dark brown trim. Mis jet-black hair v^as neatly styled. He looked younger than his 27 years. According to papers read in court, pre- sentencing investigation received letters from the victim's wife, son and daughter, which described the victim as a loving fa\u00ad ther, grandfather and son. The victim wzs survived by his 86-year-old fether, his wife, three adult chikJren and several grandchil\u00ad dren. The prosecution described Kovacevich as the perpetrator of the brutal homicide of the 6S-year-old former pastor who had befriended him. Kovacevich had made nu\u00ad merous visits to his victim's house, and vtfas there voluntarily, when, for some reason, he kicked, choked, stomped and repeatedly smashed the victim's head against the floor. He left the bociy in the house with a note to be discovered by the family, took the victim's car, and fled. After being returned to Rochester, Kovacevich was indicted by agrand jury, but a week before the trial, a plea bargain v^ras struck because famity ntembers dkl not want details of the crime to be brought out in the trial; \"dragged through the mud\" vvas the phrase they used. At the sentencing, Public Defender James D. Stevenson saki that letters from the victim's femify show the good skfe of the victim, someone bek>ved by his famify, and who had done a lot of good in life. But he went on to say that there was another side of the victim's life. One TV inter\u00ad viewer implied the victim was a \"monster\". Reportedly, Kovacevich alleged improper sexual relations, and saw his victim as an evil man, morally unfit to live. Itwas implied thatKovacevich felt that he was morally justified in killing his victim. But, according to Assistant DA Kenneth Hyland, whatever their relationship was, it was voluntary, continuing and broke no laws. Public Defender Stevenson said that pre-sen\u00ad tence investigation showed that Kovacevich had a history of mental and emotional difficulty. He was adopted at an early age, and then his adop\u00ad tive mother died in his early childhood. He was a highly overactive child, with a history of being confined in mental hospitals for most of his life. \"Jacob is starting to understand that he had no right to end a life. He has admitted his guilt,\" said Stevenson. Speaking through Stevenson jn a written statement, Kovacevich apologized to the victim's family. He said he never had lit wilt, nor a desire to hurt the femily. and that he hopes someday they may be able to forgive him. After his lawyer finished reading his prepared statement. Jacob mumbled^ In a barely discern\u00ad ible voice, something like, \"I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused to everybody who had to deal with me.\" But in both his ovfn statement and his statement read by his lawyer, Kovacevich seemed to avoid any expression of concern for the victim. Kovacevich was originaily charged with three counts of second-degree murder, which could have resulted in a sentence of 25 years to life, along with fourth-degree grand larceny, and third-degree unauthorized use of a motor ve\u00ad hicle. With the concurrence of the victim's femily. Kovacevich was allowed to plead guilty to a lesser charge of first-degree manslaughter, in exchange for a sentence of 20 years. In accor\u00ad dance with that agreement. Judge Donald Mark sentenced Kovacevich to 20 years in prison, with five years post-release supervision, and assessed him a state surcharge of $215. Hc will be etigible for parole in 17 years. -This article includes some material from the Rochester Detnocrat atid Chronide, by Matt Leingang, Michael Zeigler and Alan MorrelL Gaianti continued from p.

According to the contract between the union and the town, employees can be suspended only if they present \"a clear arwl present danger\" to the tovm or felk>w employees. Gaianti says that his felk>w workers are behind him on the issue. Gaianti called his lawyer Lawrence Krieger, union president Jim Phillips, and unk>n representative Peter Nichols. \"The union immediately fired off a stem letter requesting that I be immediately re-in\u00ad stalled for violation of various articles fn our contract, and advising the town I woufd probably seek legal counsel on violation of my First Amendment righcs.

The NEA's Gay and Lesbian Caucus rec\u00ad ommended that instead of bringing the resolution to a vote, the measure be sent to a task force for study. The decision was made after a protest by anti-gay groups v^ich demonstrated out\u00ad side the Los Angeles Convention Center, where the NEA's annual convention was being held. News reports kientified the anti-gay organizers as Focus on the Family, an anti-gay fundamentalist group based in Colorado Springs, Colo., and the Capitol Resource Institute, another anti-gay funda\u00ad mentalist group in California. Around 600 people attended, holding signs with mes\u00ad sages such as \"Kinder^rten & Homosexu\u00ad ality?\" and \"Educate, Don't Indoctrinate\". Protestors called the resolution \"a radical social agenda that the vast majority of the American people do not support\" The protest was publicized heavify over conser\u00ad vative Christian radio shows. Focus on the Family has syndicated radk> programs heard daify on 2,900 stations In this country ak>ne. The proposed resolution, which may be considered again next year, includes many of the same policies currently protecting stu\u00ad dents against racism and sexism. It also has language supporting the creation of materials and programs specificalty fbr tesblan, gay, bisexual and transgendered students, as well as schtK>l-based programs to help all people who work in schools by discouraging dis\u00ad crimination. \"The nation's largest teachers' union has identified that anti-LGBT bias is a problem for students^ and they've oudined a number of steps to eliminate that bias in the classroom,\" said M.K. Cullen, public policy director for the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Net\u00ad work (GLSEN) in New York City. \"We're pleased that they've taken steps to (discuss) this issue at their Representative Assembly, and to talk about it as urgent and important.\" Cathy Figel, <:hair of the NEA's Gay and Lesbian Caucus, said. \"This is an emotional topic for everyone and we believe a task force is the best way to first hear everyone's voice and then develop actions that witl create safer schools for students and staff.\" The aborted effort to pass the resolution came on the heels ofa report released in fate May by the N.Y.C.-based Human Rights Watch, whkh tamd that lgbt youth in the U.S. oftm experience daily harassment, abuse and violence at the hands of their peers. -Rhonda Smith, The Washington Bfcide Surgeon General advises tolerance; conservatives object Surgeon General David Satcher Issued a re\u00ad port on June 28 recommending \"recognition and tolerance of the diversity of sexual values within any community,\" The Bush administration dismissed Satcher's report as \"issued by a surgeon general tliat (Bush) did not appoint.\" Bush supports only \"abstinence-based\" programs as the \"most effective way to prevent AIDS, to prevent unwanted pregnane/'. Satcher's report notes that there are two kinds of school-based education programs: abstfnence-onfy programs, that simply tell youth to abstain from sexual activities, and STD/HIV education programs that provkie Information on condoms and other types of contraception, as well as abstinence. Satcher's report states that there are very few pub\u00ad lished evaluations of abstinence-based pro\u00ad grams, and it is \"too early to draw definite conclusions about this approach.\" Thc report, titied \"The Surgeon General's CatI to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior,\" calls for con\u00ad tinued research and discussion, and provides information on STDs, HIV/AIDS, sexual abuse, coercion and prejudice, unintended pregnancy and abortion. Satcher suggests that community responsi\u00ad bility includes access to \"devetopmentaliy and culturally appropriate sexuality education, as well as sexual and reproductive heafth care and counseling.\" Proposals include respect for diversity and freedom from stigmatization and vk>lence on the basis of gender, race, ethnicity, rel)gk>n or sexual orientation. The report says that extreme forms of pr^udice against ^ys can lead to violence, and can cause depressk>n and suklde at\u00ad tempts. One recommendation made by Satcher Is that youth be given education sidlls training, setf-esteem-promoting ex\u00ad periences and appropriate servkes relating to sexuality. The conservative Family Research Coun\u00ad cil of Washington, D.C. disagreed, espe\u00ad cially objecting to the call to de-stigrnatize v^at they refer to as \"so-called sexual orientation.\" Spokesperson Heather Cirmo claimed that \"just because a community discourages the practice of homosexuality does not mean that community also advo\u00ad cates violence against those engaged in that homosexuality \"risky\" and \"unhealthy\" behavior. \"Dr. Satcher's courageous effort to stand up to conservative groups and President Bush in releasing this report sends an im\u00ad portant message to the woHd about the need for dialogue and education about sexuality, including the sexuality of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered people,\" said Rhoda Buckner, executive director of PFLAG of metropolitan Washington, D.C. -Rhonda Smitii, The Washington Biade Bush flip-flops on faith-based group discrimination The Bush administration has filp-fiopped on its acceptance of a proposal related to its \"feith-based initiative\" which involved a request by the Safvation Army to continue discriminating against gays in hiring. The Salvation Army asked to be exempt from denial of federal funds for violating state and bcal anti-discrimination laws whkh protect gays. ^ Reports ofa secret agreement to grant the Sahation Army request brought an uproar of criticism. The administration announced late on July i 0 thatthe Salvation Army's proposal had in feet been rejected, just hours after Vice President Dick Cherfey (whose daughter Mary is a lesbian) an\u00ad nounced that churches and feith-based groups would be allowed to continue dis\u00ad crimination against gays In running secular programs with taxpayer money. Bush spokesnnan Dan Bartiett said that senior administration officials had decided that rc^lgkHis groups will ultimately get the go-ahead through the courts to violate anti-discrimination laws wHh impunity.

The courts have said that this includes indh^kJuals' religious practices. For those rdigions that preach against gays, thatwould mean freedom to reject gay job applicants. Ralph G. Neas, president of People for the American Way, commented, \"It is ap\u00ad palling diat President Bush is even consid\u00ad ering trading away America's promise of equal protection under the law in exchange for lobbying help for his misguided and unconstitutional proposaf. Using taxpay\u00ad ers' money to fund refigious organizations Is a stunningly dangerous idea for freedom and this secret deal b>etween the adminis\u00ad tration and the Salvation Army is the proof This proposed arrangement would cre\u00ad ate a kind of civil-rights-free zone in whkh religous organizations that receive federal money would be able to fkxit laws passed by state and kxal governments to protect their citizens from workplace discrimina\u00adtion, it is a shodcingly hypocHtieai agreement, especially coming from an administration that ciaims to be committed to the protection of state and local rights.... The reported Bustv SaKfatlon Army agreement powerfully Illus\u00ad trates why govemment money and govem\u00ad ment policy must not become entangled in religion, and previous administrations have wisely sought to maintain govemment neu\u00ad trally toward rei^|[k>n.

The AmendnrYent was presented on July 12, and will require ratification tsy both houses of Congress and the legislatures of 38 states to iMscome law. On Juty 12 a coalition of refigious and femity policy experts held a news conference to challenge what they called an attempt to end the progress made toward validation of same- sex relationships. Bari>ara Cox, associate dean of academic affeirs and professor of law at California Westem School of Law, drew a parallel with the now-repudiated anti-misce\u00ad genation laws dutt barred interracial maniage until 1967. Thirty-four states have passed laws defining marriage as only be^reen a man and a woman. -Associated Press; Califomia Westem School of Law Around the world with gay pride parades Gay pride was celebrated arouiul the worid In June. In New York City, hundreds of thou\u00ad sands attended the city's 32nd pride parade. Three dozen same sex couples held a wedding celebration, preskied over by two ministers and a rabbi, to idck off the march. Toronto's parade drew an estimated 700,000. In Buriington, Vt^ the lgbt communiQr cel\u00ad ebrated pride and the first anniversary of civil unions on June 16. Openly ^y state legislator Rep. Bill Lippert toki the crowd that the civil union law still faces attacks that will culminate in the ekKtion of 2002. San Francisco's 31st pride parade saw an estimated one milHon celebrants, who were fed by a lesbian motorcade of Dykes on Bikes. Openly gay City Supervisor Mark Leno said, 'This is a great opportuniy to raise the visibil\u00ad ity of the gay community. San Francisco is the first city in the country to pass legislation whkh wilt ensure that transgender employees will have equal access to our city healthcare.\" In some places around the world, gays were punished for openly celebrating pride. In Belgrade, bands of hooligans attacked partki\u00ad pants in that city's first pride parade on June 30. Reports varied, and the attackers were described as \"hundreds\" (BBC), \"dozens\" (As\u00ad sociated Press) or \"several hundred\" fetal ities, but severaf gay activ\u00ad ists and police officers required hospitaliza\u00ad tion after being beaten and kicked. On July 2, the European branch ofthe Intemational Les\u00ad bian and Gay Association (ILGA) said it will lobby the European Unk>n to protest the violence In Belgrade. In Zimbabwe, the group Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe (GALZ) received death threats before aruJ after the bullied and Indmidatted. Not all intemational pride parades were attacked. The gay pride parade fn Sao Paulo, Brazil drew 200,000 people on June 17, compared to 2,000 people at the Hrst parade In 1996. Mayor Marta Suplicy spoke to celebrants at a rally In the city's g^f bar area. In Beriin, half a millk>n people marched on June 23 in a Christopher Street Day gay pride parade, and a rainbow fiag flew over Chy Hall. Eigh^ fioats took part, and openly gay Mayor Klaus Wowerelt said at die rally, \"We tremists a finger's wkith.\" Wowerelt came out June 10, sbc days before he was elected mayor by city councillors. The f^ris Pride Parade on June 23 also saw around 500,000 participants, and as in Berlin, an openly gay mayor, Bertrand Delanoe, was involved. Delanoe led the procession behind a banner reading \"All together against discrimination\". March\u00ad ers demanded equal access to adoption and artificial insemination, and recognition of the Nazis' anti-gay atrocities. In Milan, Italy, 30,000 people marched, although the mayor told the media that the city \"did not share the sentiments of this rally\". In Tel Aviv, Israel, around 150 Israeli and Palestinian gays marched to protest Israel's occupation of partof the WestBankand Gaza Strip. Dalit E^m told the Associated Press that they did not feel the time was right for a colorful festh^l. \"Gay pride shouM not just be a carnival but a day of solkiarity....

Rochester's Catho\u00ad lic Family Center offers assistance fot older GBLTs who may bc expenencing the pain of the loss ofa parent, partner, child or loved one. Counseling is available on a sliding fee scale based on the client's means at the Elder Ser\u00ad vices Department (Eldersource) at the Catho\u00ad lic Family Center, in thc Sibley Tower Building 25 Franklin St. Services are aimed at those age 60 or older, or their caregivers. Thtough indi\u00ad vidual or group therapy and workshops, coun\u00ad selors can help with anxiety, deptession ot the death of a loved one. Trained counselors will visit homes or skilled care facilides,or even stay in touch over the telephone. As Elder Services counseling manager Toby Gold told The EmpPf Cioset., \"Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional.\" Clients are often referred to Elder Services through other service units at Catholic Family Services, or through outside agencies. Gold is especially concerned about older GLBTs who may feel isolated, either in their homes or at a skilled care facility. \"In many cases, the support of their family may not be there, emotionally or physically,\" he said. \"One of the more com\u00ad mon situadons we deal with is grief, and every\u00ad one has woric to do in dealing with grief. Thcy have to work through stages of denial, anger, depression, and acceptance/' You don't have to be Catholic to receive services, which are offered on a non-denomi\u00ad national basis. Gold says that openness w^as key when he proposed to his supervisor that the department offer outreach to the JocaJ GLBT community. Most of the funding for the Elder Services Department comes through donations to the United Way, and the New York State Office of the Aging, with only a small amount of money coming from donations from local Catholics. **Nobody gets tumed down because they can't afford this care,\" Gold insists. Medicare cov\u00ad erage will be accepted beginnix^ this summer. Eldersource can bc contacted at 325-2800. SkiUed care facility concems Ifyou are an older GLBT, the loss or sepa\u00ad ration from a parmer or your family can bc even more troubling than for most hetero\u00ad sexuals. Observers feel most of the older GLBTs in Rochester who seek care do so privately. Other older gays and lesbians may feei isolated in their homes, and especially if they live in a skilled care facility. \"There are few services available for older GLBTs,\" says Rochester counselor William Kelly. \"In some larger cities, such as New York or Philadelphia, jnou see more programs such as seniors clubs or assisted-living facilities for GLBTs.\" Toby Gold toid The Empty Closet that he has heard stories of problems caused by the pres\u00ad ence of GLBTs in skilled care facilities else\u00ad where in the country. \"Sometimes the other residents or even the professional staff may be uncomfortable with the sexuality of a patient,\" he said. Neither Gold nor Kelly are aware of any problems surrounding elder GLBTs in skilled care facilities locally. Kelly is quick to point to the Adantic 5-0 group in Rochester as one organization that tries to develop social activiries to serve older GLBTs. \"Unfortunately, this issue is some\u00ad thing that should be addressed,\" says Kelly. Adantic 5-0, a group for gay men 50 and over, meets the second Tuesday of the month at the GAGV Community Center, 179 Adan\u00ad tic Ave. For more information, call the group at MOCHA.

If it were not for Kathryn Acey and the women of color wbo have served as executive directors of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, and the recent hires of people of color to head Pride at Work and thc Intemarional Lesbian and Gay Human Rights Commission, we would be a perfect zero at the national level. Forty years of whiteness as the image ofour movement leaves very litde room for any anti-racist credibility on our part. When Is Equality Not Enough? >. TTiere is a consequence to having the LGBT advocacy agenda left to die more privileged members ofour communities. Without mean\u00ad ingful diversity in leadetship, LGBT activists Jeav? ourselves open to the accusation that wc are spoiled \\irhite people seeking \"special rights.\" The Right didn't create our marketing image. We did. In doing so, we created a paradox in our queer union. We have political influence by virtue ofour voting numbers. Wc use that influence to gain access to the corri\u00ad dors of polirical power, induding and local govern\u00ad ment agendes, as well as to the boardrooms of corporate America, which has led to the \"gay vagueing\" of LGBT images in advertisements. We have not, however, used access to politi\u00ad cal power to successfully attain accountability to our omt stated civil ri^ts agenda, account\u00ad ability to our health and himian services needs, accountability to the needs of those whom we call our closest allies, accountability to the least privil<^ed in our own midst; We have cteated our own Oz. Raise the curtain, ladies and gendemen, and there isn't much there: no EmploymentNon-Discrimination Act, rK> hate crimes law, no end to discrimination in the military, virtually zero public funding of our health and human services needs (Califomia, New York and Massachusetts combined total less than $10 million). In^MTOving EfiTecttveneaa of LGBT Ad\u00ad vocacy Queer activists have created a market and built institutions that we pay for largdy out of our own pockets, but we have yet to build a movement with the diverse leadetship neces\u00ad sary to articulate a broad agenda and the capac\u00ad ity to mobilize a grassroots constituency. We have to create communities in places where peof^e are losing thdr lives to booze and loneliness and despair, rather than idealize gentnfied ghettoes for middle gayness by pre* wotk It Jotetfi\u00bbes widi our ability to train and develop the leadership capadty of the people in our community who are still terribly aftaid of coming out at jobs they can't afford to lose. It interferes with our ability to create and sustain services for the people in out community who are messy, troubled, poor and most in need of community and the ability to advocate for themsdves. I speak of advocacy and leadership that is consdous of what dass and tace means, be\u00ad cause without that consdousness, wc will not know or touch the young butch who passes and prays no one will ever find out because it will cost her her life in the Bronx. We will not know or touch the life ofthe effeminate Afri\u00ad can-American boy in rainbow rtaiiy is ttot ettougL We will not speak to the old woman in our midst, bereft of family and overwhelmed with grief over the death ofthe only companion she has ever known, who faces the end ofher life still atiraid and now alone. We will not know what healing means for the gay man with AIDS on wdfare who cannot survive on *Svorkfare.\" We'll think \u2014 like thc reformists and centrists ofour time \u2014 that all we have to do is get him off welfare. Wc won't know how to create commxmity with him. We have to understand economic injustice and racism as bdng about aU of these people, about us \u2014 not those \"p>oor people of color.\" What Can be Done? If wc want a diverse movement, we need to plan it, fund it and organize it. It isn't enough to say that wc believe in diverse institutions and leadership. We need to plan for that diver\u00ad sity, we need to* invest in developing diverse leadership. Movement building is about learn\u00ad ing to defeat the shame that we as queers and people of color internalize from years of pov\u00ad erty or racist, sexist and homphobic violence and discrimination. Wc don*t need handouts and cute programs. We need to leam how to speak for and organize on our own behalf. Tbegooti netfs is tbat a* can creeite and sustain a and diverse movement, W^e can support divetse teadersblpt institittions and communities iftt^ decide to do so. The good news is the develop\u00ad ment of LGBT community centers. The good news is family rights otganizing. The good news is dvil unions. The good news is that, althou^ public funding for our health and hunun services are a pittance/there are a lot more of us knocking on federal, state and local political doors to demand that a fair share of tax dollars be invested in the health of our communities through better research, educa\u00ad tion and treatment. The good news is that the radal demographics ofthe country are chang\u00ad ing, and the face of who is queer in America wiU change with it. The good news is the growth of the transgender community. Thc gpod news is LGBT youth unwilling to accept the lack of divetsity that has plagued thdr predecessors. It will take more than a handful of rich individuals and well-tesourced institutions to change the reality of radsm, the despair of poverty or the pervasiveness of heterosexism. It will take an army of activists and organizers ttfbo are tattgftt to be advocates and organizers, ttfbo imi tattgftt to ask fot what they need, a^tffv tat^t how to demand accountability from thdr politicians, from thetr school boards, from the media and ftom tfadr thropic insdmtiooa. have Ibundation and individud behind is nothing spontaneous about radsm, sexism or hctcroscxism. They arc planned, and thcy are systemic forms of oppression. Their perpetuation is insured by thc people wbo put hundreds of millions of dollats in the cof\u00ad fers of the Heritage Foundation, die Eag^e Forum, and the Christian Coalition. For an effective national movement, we need to in\u00ad vest in organizing spedfic populations at local leveb. We need to invest in advocacy and not just in election campaigns. We need to invest in creat- ingsuccess, not victory. Victory requites some\u00ad one else's defeat. Success does not require anyone's failure. It requires thc lifting up ofour own people so that they will succeed despite die hatred ofour enemies. The existence of community centers or or\u00ad ganizing communities in 104 dties and 38 states means tliat quccts in small towns and rural America can find ways of ending their isolation and taking cate of each other. The devdopment of autonomous people of color instimtions, sudi as the Audre Lorde Project in New Yotk City and thc Esperanza Center in San Antonio axid dozens of odiers around the country, will insure the devdopment ofa more radally diverse leadership in our future.

Gay travel and convention business is a $4.7 billion industry. What's exciting is that typical gay conventions and events go to major cities with known high populations of gays- Rochester has the second-highest popu\u00ad lation of gays in New York State, outskle N.Y.C-, and we have many community re\u00ad sources, including the GAGV.

Nka fasti* Presbyterian General Assembly votes in favor of gays' ordination By Deanna Tiefantltal The Presbyterian Church (USA) is on a path that might make it the first U.S. mainUne denomination to welcome LGBT people as ministers. At their annual meeting (General Assembly or GA) held June 9 -6 in Louisville, Ky., commissioners voted by a 60-percent margin to remove the barrfers against LGBT ordination as deacons, ekJers, and minis\u00ad ters. If ratified by a majority of the 173 presbyteries (regional goveming bodies), the measure would take effect next June. Even the most optimistic LGBTs and their allies in attendance had only timorously ventured that they nugf^t \"win\" by one or two percent; So when the vote of 317-208 was announced, all sat silent in disbelief. Then they stood to verify from the over\u00ad head monitors what their ears had just tokl them. Stunned, people raised their hands to their mouths and then clasped hands with those around them. Tears flowed, and fi\u00ad nally hugs and smiles, as reality set in. As the Rev janie Spahr, one ofthe leaders In the movement, left the auditorium, many reached out to touch her. Afcerwards, she tried to put the moment into words. \"It was so untmlievable. With the whole gathering singing 'Here am I. God... I've heard You calling... SerKi mc, God' to prepare for the vote, and then there was that loud clap of thunder right i>efore the Commissior>ers voted, shaking the building. And then for the margin to be by 10 percent* You couldn't help but be in awe.\" The denomination's rules prevented Rev. Spahr from accepting a position as Co- Pastor at Downtown linited Presbyterian Church of Rochester in 1991. The 2.5 million-member der>omination has struggled with this issue at least since 1978, v^en the General Assembly rejected a study report that recommended that ho\u00ad mosexuality not be used to bar ordination. Overtures (proposals) to permit LGBT ministers and officers have l>een before the General Assembly in 18 ofthe past 20 years. It has k>een a long and frustrating efFort for Presbytenan LGBTs and their allies. Some have left the church or even given up their ordination. (See the article about former executive presbyter Bll! Hawley on page I of July's Empty Chset) Many theories have been tossed around on why the vote margin was so large this time Perhaps the Boy Scout issue in the news this past year awakened moderates, who decided they needed to speak up, to take a stand. Or maybe it was the Southem Baptists voting to bar women ministers that stirred up those Jn the middle. Maybe the conservatives have shifted their emphasis to the Jesus-as*the-only-savior issue. And just maybe it was the mix of delegates thb year. From the start of tha week, there were si^s that this could be a more liberal GA than usual. (Each year a different sat of deles&tes Is chosen to attend, to hear the issues, and to vote. An equal numbar of ministers and lay eMers attend from each of the church's presbyteries - typically two or fcxir from each. They do not represent their presbyteries, but are to vote their con- sciefKe. Sbc of the 558 this year were openly gay) One of the first items of business each year is to elect a Moderator, who presides over the week's plenary sessions and repre\u00ad sents the denomination in the coming year. Jack Rogers, author and former vice presi- d^itof San Francisco Theological Seminary, won handily this year over three other candidates - and on the first ballot, a rarity. Rogers ran for Moderator as a \"bridge builder\" because ofhis roots as an evangeli\u00ad cal at Fuller TheologkaJ Seminary and his later more liberal views. In his candkiate speech he said, \"I support all families of every shape, size, color, traditional and non- traditional.\" Rogers has recently written a book de\u00ad scribing how Presbyterians over the past 150 years iiave changed positions on sla\u00ad very, remarriage after divorce, and the role ofwomen in ministry. In a press conference just after his election, Rogers responded to a question ai>out whether he's betrayed his evangelical roots. \"1 have only applied what I knew to an area I'd never given attention to,\" he said. \"The more I studied (the role of LGBT ministers), the more they didn't look different. The way we are dealing with homosexuals is exactJy the way we dealt with African-Americarw and women \u2014 in the eariy days.\" Another sign of indusivity throughout the week was the intentional effort to bririg delegates together one on one. After each major break in the committee that 1 fol\u00ad lowed, the 25 members had to seek out someone new to sit next to and to take a few minutes to get to know them. Also, time was purposely scheduled througfiout the week in the form of \"Speak Outt\" and testimony for and against issues, when del\u00ad egates and issue advocates could bring up matters that were important to them or to the gathering. It is ofcen these personal issues and stories that nnove and change the hearts of others. One such story came from a youth advi\u00ad sory delegate. Amy Belt of the Hudson River Presbytery just north of New York City. With his permission, she told ofthe struggle her 15-year-old gay brother is going through to resolve the conflict between what the fVesbytarian Church advocates and his da- sire to folbw what he discerns as his call from God to the ministry. Aiso compaHif^ were tite many examples put forth of Iww fHends, neighbors, relatives, and church members have found that they can con\u00ad tinue to bve arKl support aach other, even though on one or two issues they are diametrically and immovably opposed. Another sign was how the Committee on the Peace, Purity, and Unity of the Church responded to the issues assigned to them. One was to recommend a process fbr Presbyterians to becter deal with theo\u00ad logical and constitutional issues tiiat arise. The Committee's first action was to set up a body to create and administer the pro\u00ad cess and to call it a task force, rather than a commissbn. This is rK>t as trivial as it sounds, because a \"commission\" is already specifically defined in the Presbyterian con\u00ad stitution as having to consist of an equal number of clergy and lay elders (both ordained positions), which would exclude any (openly) gay or lesbian members from being part of the process. This was irKlis- putabty unsatisfactory to the Committee. Therefore, they chose to call the body a task force, which does not have those restrictions. Just the fact that concem for full participation surfoced so early in the deliberations, and without any objection or fuss, was heartening and should have been a clue of what was to come. Looking back over the weeic, the out\u00ad come mi^t have been more predictable. But then the jubilation wouldn't iiave been so great. And LGBTs and their allies will need aii the enthusiasm they can hang onto to get them through the coming year. Recent votes in presbyteries indicate the cask progressive advocates foce over the next six to nine months. The most recent vote is encoura^rig. Presbyteries firmly rejected an effort to forbid Presbytetian ministers from performing same-gender unions. Many feared the way it was worded could lead to forbidding pastors from min\u00ad istering to LGBT members at any mile\u00ad stone in their spiritual lives, such as baptiz\u00ad ing their children, iH>lding memorial ser\u00ad vices, or visiting in the hospitals. Everyone, on all sides of this issue, can agree on one thing \u2014 tfiat the energy this turmoil iias consumed could atui should be better spent on other church aiKl societal concems, such as peace, hunger, and suf\u00ad fering. But you cannot have peace without justice, and LGBT ordination is a justice issue and must be resolved. Deantk!

It's not much ofa house, just an old 1923 place in che dty, but to us it's a mansion. Itis a place of magic built with love over time. You couldn't walk over an inch of the property without one of us being able to tcll you something special about it Why the walls are a certain color, where each picture came ftom, whete our friends have gathered for pictures duting the holida3rs: I can even tell you why the dandelions in the front comer of the 3^ard still exist. They arc there because it was either finish with theii pulling or spend a couple of minutes with Todd befbre he had to rush off to work. I wish I could carry our house with me every time I want to show the world what it means to be gay. It is the perfect demonstra\u00ad don that we are so much more than sexual acts. But, more importandy, I take enor\u00ad mous pride in what Todd and I have built together. What I can do once a year is march in the parade. For me the parade is a personal symbol of happiness with who I have grown to be, and a ttiumphal march with our com\u00ad munity celebrating our existence and values and loves. God, how 1 love the parade. Not very big compared to big dues like Toronto or New York\u00ab but the boys on the float are just as fiill of life and the queens are jttst as outra\u00ad geously eleven And the outpouring of people in a small dty like ours is amazing. A gay Youth Group, a dozen gay rel^ous otgani- zatioas, gay business networics, an alphabet soup of gay otgamzatioas and support groupsi All winding Its way in celebradon down Park and Goodfirua. Last year was the fitst I had ever person\u00ad aUy been confronted with and-gay protest- eta. I was shocked and confused that they woiM even show iq>. The weather was dE^ipy, for one thing. But I know enough Redl Christian Evangelkab to have gotten over it quickly. If thcjr wanted to stasxl drenched on the corner of Park and Goodman in ttue belief that diey wete ttyii^ to save oursouls, well, God Jove chem. Which is exacdy what we shouted hack at them. This year, ho^\u00bb^cver was d: t tcrent-This was no personal wimess for Chrisd Itwas agaunt- let on two sides of thc street, complete with bullhorns, rude signs and hate speech. Speech so vile that if it had been directed at any other group, violence would have been a distinct possibility. (Note to the officers in chaige: wake up and look at your polides concerning protesters at events.*) And there was our Youth Group. Teens walking a gaundet of hate and verbal abuse. Our religious groups, our ^imilies, our seniors... all walking that short tunnel of hate. At that point my mind shut down. I laughed. For 200 feet of Goodman, I laughed outrageously and uncontrollably. I did it be\u00ad cause I wanted to cry and because I was so angry and those two emodons werc at war with one I barely recognized at the time. Pride. Maybe you don't get it until you are con\u00ad fronted with outz^t hate. I am damned proud to bc part of the gay community of Rochester, every speedo-weani^, sequincd, leathered, community-building, faith-based part of it, induding the warm loving life I've built with Todd. And I don't like putting up with bigots at our community events one bit. I'm not the tum the other cheek type, it makes for two bruised jaws, not one. Next year I will do the one thing I know will dck those bigots off the siosc I will come back. This dme with even more ptide than last year. I am already threatening Todd with the tnggest public display of afiectk>n kiss ever to hit that comer of Goodman and trying to figure how to get every one of my fnends, fsunily and supporters to show i^. Pnde. h^ifMness, community, aco^tance, k>ve.

The intedudes between each soi^ are often mote intetesting tfaan die music ttadf. Z will look completely different (and ondoubtably more beaudfiil) tfaan she did on her last \u00abdeasc. 3. And perfa^ss, most inq>ortant, her music vkleos will tcnund you why she ts an *'Icon.\" Janet is what I consider a video star. Many of our cotrent artists are. What I mean by this is, witfaout tfaeir music videos these artists wouldn't be neatly as popular or successfiiL In feet, ever since tfac launch of MTV, we have changed our standatd for what we consider to be a talented silver. They no lof^er faave to be vocally stiong. But they MUST have a good vkleol Consider tfac fact that Janet's first two attwims barely got any attention. In fsct, ifyou tfaink C\u00abe\u00abSra/was her first album, you would be ptovingappoint. CiNRAni/was in fact her third ^Dwm, but it tvas tfae first to have any music vidbos promoting it. As with ber previous albums (this one makes cigfa^,siiedelivecsup-to-ahe-second pop dance songs and ballads. She is nothing if not cutting edge wfaen it comes to her sound.

It b marketing at its vety best: make a kiDer video that everyone wiU love and talk about and you'U sell records. One thing is truly evident in this collecdon that hasn't been before: Janet is single (and apparendy ready to mingle). For most ofjanet's career she has been married, first to James E>eBarge from the '80s semi-successfiil group DeBarge (\"Rhythm of the Night\" was their biggest hit). That marriage lasted less than two years and was followed by her secret marriage that lasted neariy nine years to manager Rene Elizondo. So, for the first time, J anet is sixiging about finding a new telationship: it's evident in the tide track, when she tells the shy gu)^: \"Come and talk to me /Promise you won't have an attitude/ Yes it's cool/ Yes in die niood.\u00ab\" Similariy, \"Someone To Call My Lover\" is also an obvious advertisement that she is look\u00ad ing for love. I hope she doesn't really expect to find true love this way: \"Maybe well meet at die bar/ Hell drive a funky car/ Maybe well nnbeet at a club/ And fall so dee^y in love/ Hell tell me I'm the only one/ And well have so much fim/ FU bc the giri ofhis dreams, maybe.\" Maybe this is how you got yourself in trouble die last two times, Janet. Maybe the ultimate question '\\%^ does AJi For yV* deliver? The answer is, not really. While she continues to grow as a visual artist, her voice has feiled to improve much since her first album (anyone remember ^oung Love*?) And her album formula seetns to remain the same, compete witfa hard to hear but often fiinny intedudes, and die usual tine up of trendy dance songs aod sultry ballads that you won't necessarily remember much past the few montfas diey are in heavy rotation on radio and video television. I guess I just expected sotnething new and fresh with her newfound independence. A few of the dance soi^, ''All For You\", \"Come On Get Up\", \"and Call My Lover,\" will make for danoe videos. And ballads such will faer to showcase her now over\u00ad exposed but ofa-so-finely buffed body as weiL I even tried despenuely to tfae (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You).\" Un\u00ad fortunately thoi^^ it seems to go astray eariy and gets too confiising just wbetx it was about togetcooL Oh, and Janet, one tnote thing: what is with all the swearing in this album? Although I use my fair share of it mjrself, I worry when a singer starts using a lot of bad language on their records, as it is often a sign that they are running out of diings to say. While this album is by no means widiout good moments and will without question top dve charts for mondis to come, I have to say that, as with her last few albums, I don't feel like I want to run out and buy it. I'd much radier watch thc videos. Reviews: Video Out on Video By Lewis Ojeda Ifyou think Hollywood was the only source of anti-gay hysteria in fihn, think again. I recently found this uproariously uptight German black and white film from 1958 tdeased on video from Sinister Cinema. Tbe IhitdShcis the type of movie Jetty Falwell must have seen before he entered the ministry. Luckily, we're at a point where we can watch dus movie and laugh derisively, because from die moment when die credits claim the movie is \"based on actual court records,\" you know this one's headed over the brink of plausibility. Klaus is the type of son evety patent wants. He's tops in his dass, artistically taknted, and wdl liked in school. Too bad that for his Teutonic parents he's just not good enough Dad swiUs his brandy and talks about how his bank's money is \"teality.\" He thinia Junior's just wasting his time with all that artistic non\u00ad sense. Mom's no better. She's worried that Klaus spends too much tithe hangiiig atound his blind buddy Manfted. Seems that HerrManny's reading novels and poetry is just a littie coo much tenderness for her, since she deariy gets none of this from her husband. Both parents are so repressed that I had to wonder if thcy get fully dressed befote going to bed. Thc film wants Klaus to change his ways, of course, so it reverts to such illogical contor\u00ad tions that reason goes completdy out the win\u00ad dow. The ThirdSexthen becomes a pants-pissing hilarious import from Hell. Klaus is never in any real danger from his relationship with Manfred, except for thc occa\u00ad sional fistfi^t in school when he's protecting him. The sense of danger is entirely specula\u00ad tion. When he leartis Klaus is visiting Boris, a gay man with a taste for art and music. Dad blows a gasket and assumes his son's headed down the path to gangs and killing old ladies. He even dtes one case as \"evidence\" (precur\u00ad sor to Fox News?). Mom finds thc entry \"The Third Sex\" in an encydopedia with 18th cenmry knowledge. She's so aghast, she deddes to have one of Klaus' female classmates get together with him for a date. Hey, Dad, Mom's pimpin' again! This gid's attempted \"seduction\" ofKlaus whik posing for his drawings is one of the funniest Pve seen, and that's not so good when the scene's tone is meant to be dead serious. Manfred feds tli^ted by diis giri's visits to Klaus, but persuades his fiiend to visit Boris at his pad. Young men stnoke, laugh, listen to avant-garde dectronic music, and wresde wear- it^ only t^t shotts. Dad never gets to see this party, but he does go to a drag show for \"re\u00ad seatch.\" Hnun^ perhaps Dad can't ^it die subconscious fedings. \"How am I supposed to tell whether that's a man or a wotnan?\" Dad hu\u00a3& after a bad dr^petfocmanoe. Later, Mom gets hauled into court on chaqjes of \"solidta- tionofaminor.\" Few films have had tfae hysteria this film has. It's amariff^ how Klaus' Hfe is relatively calm during his parents' mess.

At thdr June 2 spring concert, \"Otic Night to Gvrer when we arrived later than hoped (though still wdi before their first song) and found the larger than usud RWCC perfor\u00ad mance space all but fiHed, and landed seats fer in the back, we took note. And then when RWCC came on stage, and kept comity and coming until all 51 women, in thc flesh, ^lus one in spirit, Anita McAlister) at last arrived, again, we took note. And then RWCC started to sing. Their sound seemed not just bigger, but lighter -^ the women were not simply performing, but giv\u00ad ing! The air crackled widi exdtement; deariy RWCC had something up their collective sleeve. In addition to thdr music, a campy soap opera in four acts (written by Karen Gibson, Davya Btody, Emily Stdnbetg and Linda Sheets, and narrated by a tr^ throaty Matd Weber). Oh, we werc touched \u2014 let us count the ways: two Prima Donnas (Lisa McCollum asid Pam Good) waging ultimate fenmie warfiue (sweet lipsticked smiles and long, painted, pointed nails); Marydlen Ford's slideshow of RWCC children bathed in the song of their diorus; the dulcet voice of Liz McCabe mir\u00ad roring the loving eyes of two very attentive young daughters standii^ in the aisle; that lovely lullaby to Lily's Eye's (Stephanie Tdtswotdi and Lisa McCollum) and \"OO when your eyes meet mine, I could lose my mind...\" (Ivy Green and Aimee Gasparre). And then there was the Reflection of two vdvet smooth voices (Betsy Waugh td and Liz McCabe); the happy/sad of Magda Marfione's and Lisa Swierczynski's Leaving Home; and Emily Steinberg's leaving us (for L.A.). Fever took hold of L3rtm Stone and then Jermy Gaul (and left all of us more than a bit feverish). A High Mountain (never high enough), 51 women singing about tuming Sixty-Four (the Chorus), a Twisted Aimee Gasparre andjulie (or was it Jim?) Myers, Beach Girls, Calendar Giris (Deb Nettie, Patty Kirk), dandng girls (Sue Morgan and Jenny Gaul), school girls (Pam Good, Emily Steinberg and Amy Warcup), never-to-be Owned Girls (Amy Warcup and Sandi janiga), and Big Dogs, Music and Wild, Wild, Wild Women... Yes, thc moments werc many. And though we've not m<\u00bbitioned all 51 names (not to mention naming thdr non-singing support), we carmot help but mention tfaose dancing hands of Howard Kilbury and jim Myers on thc keys. However, even more than any indtviduai moments, more dian any indtviduals, what we liked best about that One Ni^t was the way it aU came together.

Most theorists and even some activists wete too convoluted for almost anyone to understand, and no text ever gave a stn^sle discussion ofthe broad issues encompassed by feminism. H- nally, however, I bell hooks' Femmism Is forEverybti^t. Apparendy hoc^ fdt tfae same way I did. The introduction to her book states that many of the people she has eticotmteted have had negative and uninformed views of feminism, yet there extsts no handbook for d^cribing the realities of feminism. Keeping this in mind, hooks set forth to create a text that would answer commonly asked questions^ while also reminding us that feminism is, indeed, for everybody. In cotnmon hooks fashion. Fetteittism Is for Everybody is written in an easy and accessible language that people from all backgrounds can understand. Her ch^ters move beyond the traditional discussion of white middle-class feminism and introduce such things as race, dass, and sexoali^ into the discoutse. Nototdy does she present the history of thc women's movement and the current debate, but she abo offers solutions and explanations that many other texts often lack. Divided into 19 short chaptcts, this 1 IB- page book tackles subjects from creating a positive feminist masculinity and protecting reproductive ri^ts, to discussing thc problem of dassism within the movement, and hailing lesbians in a chapter entitkd \"Totd Bliss.\" Her fitst chapter, for examf^e, briefiy traces the history of the women's movemenf^and explains why femiiusm is still necessary today. She critiques tfae movement for allowing privi- 1^^ white women to create an spends that did not serve lower-dass African Attiericans. By only striving to make women economically equal to men, and ignoring issues of dass and race, this agenda would simply be reinforcing the power structure that allowed white men unequal power in die first place. In \"Beauty VC^thin and Without,\" hooks dis\u00ad cusses the problems ofthe beauty industry and feminism; as she points out, mainstream women's magazines may indude an artide about anorexia on otie page, and then next display a picture of a 3^ung, thin woman as an icon of beauty. The feminist movement may have pro\u00ad duced pro-female magazines, yet no one has yet offered an dtemate style of femde beauty not rooted in sexism. hooks successfully accomplishes what she set out to do: create an easy, accessible hand\u00ad book that explains the broad aspects of femi\u00ad nism. She leaves no one out as she takes the theory that has traditionally belonged to the academics and transcribes it into an under\u00ad standable text With her explanations, anyone and everyone can call themsdves a feminist. R^ardless ofgendcr, class, race, and sexuality. Feminism Is for Everybody condudes diat each person can take a positive and interactive role in what hooks defines as \"a movement to end sexism, sexist exi^oitation, and Youiig.

He and the men went out for a ride And the young didn't get a chance to open his eyes. They could have removed their hate for him If only they knew how to understand. They could have not used thdr fists for him If only they knew how to control their distaste. The spittk and grease werc filled inside the two men And they became monsters from the ctoy dent. Thc snowflakes kissed the sleeping ]routh in the forest As sweet as they codd offer while he froze in the darimess. Thcy could have g^ven up thdr weapons for him If only they could leam and accept his style. They could have not made the plans for him If only they could have been educated once a whik. The red roses crystallized on the youth's flesh As the fence h\\:^ged him as hb only best. The winter land gave him a sense of peace Where he ascended into the bluest sky, fiill of dreams Tliey could have opened thdr minds for him If only they could have been open-hearted. They could have given him a space for him If only they knew how to leave and let him go home. That yout^ man's parents wept to the light of God. They became awakened and the Hate Crime bill became thdr band. The youth's mother became a powerful guard\u00ad ian angd For the men and women like her son who needed to conquer the gamble. They codd have given up their brutality for him If only they let him retum to his sweet mother. They codd have been two wise men for him If only they kt htm look into the eyes of his father. We fdt a sense of shock and disgrace vdien this was told And we ^nied the candks dirough tfae winter's cold.

Colorado, October 1991 A year ago I wrote of kisses in supermarket dsles but now it's fingersnaps \u2014 the snap queen, gay Black men's creating, popdarized by Tongues Untied. I loved watching it on movie screens, but you brought it home to me, sdf-dedared commiejewfag who does white miniskirted drag on high holy days \u2014 Halloween, Coming Out Day \u2014 and when you just fed like it. You tried to teach me how to snap with style, but I coddn't do it in front of people, coddn't even try. Itwas protection for you in Safeway, swaggering among heteros, in the produce dsle with \"the girls\" pinchii^ ripe avocados, but I gave up camp years ago, then stopp>ed wearing my black leather *cyde jacket. I'd gained wdght and butch never fit mc either. Perfonnance night: you sat on stage, bent over a notebook, fiizzy crewcut top all we codd see, read in a voice that almost shook, pldn poems about surviving rape. I thought, how brave to read this work, to act as master of ceremonies. It never crossed my mind: how bold to stand and tdk about being gay. I no longer consider it courageous \u2014 after years of hearing fag\u00ad gots, dykes, bi's shouting, march and rally, qdet coming out seems ordinary \u2014 but we are killed for this much, 3roung people die, doors still shut. Back in the audience, you began the ap\u00ad plause, surprised me, already sturmed by spotlights, my daring to climb ten steps to the stage, read sestinas without a stumble, my \"woman you never cared for me\" poem, the one about the white cat and loving a man. Ironic you praised my form when I thought it my weakest point. Perhaps we can't see our own strengths, our snaps as something to cel\u00ad ebrate, a rebirth whenever we rdse arm above head, bring thumb to ting finger, every time we say, \"I am, and I am not going away.\" -Michele Spring-Moore Imagine I saw the mountdns walk moving actoss the sea' or was that you speaking oflove ftom somewhere I used to be?

You don't necessarily have to envy someone who travels, dthough that's a common enough reaction. Indeed a traveler can seem sophisticated. People may think he's well-off, but the truth may be that thc travder does what hc does, goes where hc goes, simply because he cannot find what he is looking fbr at home. Thc tme travder is not a tourist, he is a seeker. Thc missing thing canbe anything\u2014romance, relevance, bargdns. And what to make of matters ifhe shodd find what he i% looking for in a foreign place and then is obliged to remm home? I can make someone glare at me, rise to argument in short order simply by stating how terrific it is to travel in Germany (France will do as well). I assert that many aspects of life are better there. Signage is clearer, sidewdks deaner, bread crisper, cigarettes cheaper and the waiters know their place. Americans freak out when they have to consider that theirs is not the finest example of dvilization. My most recent big trip, Iran, was unfortu\u00ad nately proceeded by severd slash and bum conversations. Widi friends, alas. Over one breakfast with two solid chums, my desire to visit Iran was greeted with a series of hiccuping gasps to the effect of why they wodd not want to visit such a backward, unsafe, dirty, etc. place. I snapped, \"It isn't about you. It's about me. Instead of griping, why not ask why it apf>eds to me! Aren't you curious?\" A sadder encounter occurred during thc week before I left for Iran. The trick, in life, is to follow through on your heart's desirers.^ I was going, although at this point I was edgy, a normd enough stage for me whenever I travel, but exacerbated this day, for no other reason than that I had grown weary of defending and explaining myself. The woman I was tdking with delivered a long speech about women's issues, the unfairness cf everything and ended up with a diatribe about femde circumcision. Which in fact, Arabs do not do. The heat ofour discussion skipped past the fact that Iranians aren't Arabs. They're Persian. They speak Farsi, not Arabic. Femde drcum- dsion is an African custom except for sotne isolated Kurdish tribes. An impleasant argu\u00ad ment ensued. I suggested my about-to-be-alien- atcd-friend use thc next twenty dollars she got her slippery fingers on to join Amnesty International, instead of, as was her habit, buying yet another pair of earrings. A frost descended. My edginess about my trip was not ameliorated and I had wounded a friend. Iran sure seems scary upon arrivd. Noisy, Crowded, confusing. We arrived in Teheran at 2 a.m., since the government wants to restrict the potentid for drport installation photogra\u00ad phy. There were hundreds and hundreds of people outside thc termind, most wdting for the now-encouraged retum visits of Iranians who had left 20 years earlier when the Shah was deposed. Consequently, entire families jammed the edt doors, all with massive bouquets of flowers. We codd not conced our foreignness and the crowd's response was curiosity, in\u00ad standy followed by great cheers of wdcome. Scary turned to cheery. Indeed all the women are doaked in head scarves and baggy coats. No one wodd insist Iranian women have a good ded, or even a fdr shake. Ifthe god of travd is to judge, it's wiser to stay home. My ambition is to experience, absorb, leam. The very word Islam translates as '^acceptance.\" IVc been daunted in thc Middle East, but never for very k>ng. The places we stayed and dieir environs were dean, wdl designed, unfsmiliar (who has browsed picture books about Iran?) and peopled by well-mannered, gradous, hand\u00ad some individuab. It's safe to walk anywhere. I was encouraged to wander on my own. For aD die restrictions, women travd \\xi complete safety. EXPAND YOUR MIND \\. I'm a collector of details \u2014 they lead to an understanding of the whole. Iran has no tits and ass cdtute \u2014 no billboards, no posters, no naked-butt postcards saying 'Svish you were here\". That's a relief, kss visual noise. To be blunt, I had no problem with wrapped women. When they wrap the men I'll com\u00ad plain, and don't fret excessively, the younger women push the envelope: colored head scarves pushed to gravity defying angles, makeup, jewelry. It's amusing to know that Iran leads the world in the inddence of rhino\u00ad plasty. Bobbed noses are the rage; it's the mdn feature one sees. From an archeologicd and architecturd point of view, the country is fasdnating. Im\u00ad mense mosques, elaborate ceramic tile deco\u00ad ration, ruins dating back to Darius and Alexander the Great. I got to wander through Persepolis and spent the aftemoon chatting with an Iraman physidan who had fled to Sweden, a sophisticated man, a bit sad over the changes in his country but still happy to be home, if only for a visit. The cdsine is rather Mediterranean, not spicy, and the produce is excellent. Gas is cheap, traffic is bad, hotels are fine and don't worry about security, there's plenty. The right people, the ones one deds with \u2014 taxi drivers, waiters, hotel staff\u2014 all speak passable English. Do you know anyone who speaks Farsi, let done Arabic? I wdked away from my group late one evening as we stopped to view an immense courtyard. A family\u2014man, women and young son \u2014 wandered past. The man slowed. He r^arded me carefully, turned, drifted back. He held his son's hand. The man and I looked at one another. Did he say, \"English, French?\" Perhaps. I answered, \"American\". Wth that he clasped my hand and squeezed it and tears filled his eyes and he sdd, \"Wdcome\". People, ordinary people a traveler meets, are tired of anger. OK, so where are thc gay people? Not to be found. It is most explidtiy against the law. Twice I locked eyes. Yes, they're here. I had a marvdous conversation with two 20-year-old 'men, one an artist having his first exhibition, both the privil^ed sons of high placed gov\u00ad emment of6dals. The artist codd have been a double for Ricky Martin. That look. Big, bri^t eyes, luxurious dark hdr, Italian designer dothes. He was sensitive, eager to talk, and it's impossibk in cdtures where conversation is vdued, openness is natural, not to feel an intimacy that can be misconstrued as gay sen\u00ad sibility. Or was it misconstrued? I coddn't tclL My finest hour occurred towards thc end of the trip in a small, mountain-side village, Massoula, a World Heritage City. We hiked a dtizdy path, past small houses, a wood cutter, a fbdom man selling sesame candy, and as I tumed I saw 12 or 15 men dressed in warm-up sdts. Aha, I thought, probably the Iranian nationd soccer team, thete had been an im\u00ad portant match a few days eadier, tm doubt diey were on a cekbratoty ezcunion. I grabbed my camera. As I snapped a pho\u00ad tograph, one man saki, '*Gold medal, gold mcdd!\" My God! Not the soccer team. The Iranian Olympic team! I was shoved toward an Olympic champion wresder and an Olympic champion weight lifter. I was a very giddy guy. They hugged. Like bdng pressed against gran\u00ad ite. I screamed for some one, anyone to take pictutes, lots of pictures. This was beyond my dreams. The athletes loved it. I swore I'd use the pictures for my Christmas cards for the next 20 years. At home I looked at my snapshots. For this trip I had removed my earrings \u2014 why be risky? I'd stopped bleaching my hair. Clearly I needed a hdrcut. Hell, I needed a week at Elizabeth Arden. The Olympians looked hot, grinning and hugging someone that for all the world looked like my grandmother. Sorry, no Christmas cards this year. Email- ELBCAD@rit.edu Conundrums By Ove Overmyer SIdeswiped For those of you who are familiar with my column, you may remember tdk some time ago about President Bush's initiative concerning proposed federal funding for faith-based orga\u00ad nizations (see: Empty Closet, Heaven and Hill, No. 333, March, 2001), I mentioned that this legislation wodd be surely headed on a colos- sd collision course. The blurring of lines be\u00ad tween church and state is an acddent wdting to happen. I just didn't think we wodd be side- swiped so soon. Last month, it came as somewhat of a sur\u00ad prise when the Sdvation Army wound up wd- lowing in a position usually reserved for more controversid organizations, such as the Chris\u00ad tian Coalition. There they were, the nation's largest philanthropic charity, caught in the cen\u00ad ter of a major Washington brou-ha-ha. Thc Army's silent apped to the White House for fix>m state and locd laws pro\u00ad hibiting discrimination agdnst gay employees stems from an intemd tension in the charit3r: as a church the Army is intolerant of sin, but at the same time, it chooses to engage with the di\u00ad verse secdar worid through its charitable ef\u00ad forts. The sneaky and underhanded approach they took with regard to their plight was ody made public by an intemd memo that happened to find its way to the desk of Wasbin^tm Post reporter. The Bush administration spin doc\u00ad tors began working overtime to qdckly squash any spedfics of what transpired. Bush was told to publidy reject the proposd the same day the document was made public. White House offi\u00ad dds insisted the request wasn't even dose to being adopted. However, the Salvation Army's document said it had a \"firm commitment\" Rosin, July 7,2001. I guess it's just the Bush cronies doing poii\u00ad tics as usud. It sort of makes you wonder how, many other secret deals are being made that will never see the ligjit of day. In exchange for giving tfae Salvation Army s^^roved sanctioned discrimination, they wodd recdve powerful strategists lobbying for the Fdth-Bascd Initia\u00ad tive, pdd for by the Salvation Anny. The concept of exchanging favors in Washington is alive and well. It's great to know the Bush administration is breathing new life in the good ol' Republican tradition. With the Army's Norman-Rockwdlian as- sodations obscured by aU this publidty, they continue to actively seek and receive govem\u00ad ment funds and contracts, both federd and locd, to run thousands of drug'treatment cen\u00ad tets, soup kitchens and homeless shdters. Thcy have become increasingly enmeshed in the poiiticd arena too, often sparring the locd governments. These events were the catdyst for the Army to contact the White House in, the first place. Their offidals say they dedded to break poiiticd neutrality and risk bad* pub\u00ad lidty because more and more dties \u2014 103 to date \u2014 were recognidng domestic parmer benefits, a condition the Sdvation Army will never accept. George Hood, a senior offidd with the Army, sdd that the otganization wodd never discritninate in delivering services. It doesn't want to hire gay employees because \"it really begins to chew away the theologicd fabric of who we are.\" (Source: University Wire^ Evelyn Aschenbrenner, Jdy 13, 2001.) So, let me get this strdght. It is prevented by its principles from hiring gay people, though not apparendy from serving them. Hmm. The factis, this pseudo-Christian organization does receive over 300 million of federd tax dollars every year. Correct me i{ I'm wrong, but being gay is not a category of tax-exempt stams. I object to my tax dollars going to an organiza\u00ad rion that refuses to hire someone based on sexud orienution. And do tell us, Mr. Hood, what theologicd fabric are you talking about? Do you mean the theology of exdusion? Making sense of all this raises the greater question of whether rdigious groups who re\u00ad ceive government funds are above federd and- discrimination law. Currendy, groups can dis\u00ad criminate based on religion. However, codd a religious group legally not hire gays in a dty like Rochester that protects on the basis of sexud orientation, or wodd federd law take prece\u00ad dence? Tdk about a legd conundrum. Like every horror film, it's coming to a courthouse near you. The Sdvation Army's image may have been shaken a bit, but, more importandy, the fallout of these shenanigans seems to be focused maidy on Bush's Faith-Based Idtiative agenda. The President has not adequatdy addressed the church and state issue to date. To this, add a pinch of sdt to old wounds, add a civil rights batde or two, and stir. I bet Congress tnight have a hard time digesting Chef Bush's redpe. With respect to the Sdvation Army, I be\u00ad lieve the institution generally does great work, and is entided to its views on homosexuality and aborrion.

Healthy and Gay By Erik Ubey STIs: Sex Tumed Infectious I was in an online recently ndien some\u00ad one sdd \"I'm hom3r\" and be goii^ around\" frcnn a fellow chatter. of \"contagious sexud atousd.\" As hu\u00ad morous that may be be, however, itis NOT die kind of infectious sex we're going to talk about here. Hiis month we b^in a series of articks discussing STIs. STI, an acronym fbr sexually ttansmitted infection, is a ttiore recent term i H ''^'' B6 \\ \\. ^-% < i^ iM;^\"^^^:^ that is often used interchangeably with the more traditiond term \"STD,\" There arc lots of STIs out there... and we've probably all heard about one or more of them. So why dedicate anymore time to discussing them? To start, it never hurts to take a second look at some of this information. For many of us, the last time we spent any time discussing STIs was in our hig^ school hedth dass... and how much of that In addi\u00ad tion, as widi anythli^ dse, information changes with time. Over the next severd months well address some new devdopments with spedfic diseases, medicd advances, treatment issues, and some \"new\" infections thatyou may never have assodated witfa sex. Second, STIs are still an important issue. I have often heard peopk say **Oh, I don't reaDy worry about catching Htat... they can cure that with medidne.\" To that end, recent smdies have shown diat, in die wake of HIV/AIDS, people have become less concerned about other sexud infections. This, however, is a potentially dangerous trend. Believe me when I tell you that NONE of the STIs is a fun or desirable experience. Some of them can have very pdnfd symptoms and serious side ef\u00ad fects. And while some are curable, some are not. Knowing the facts and how to protect yourself remain important. Finally, there is a connection between STIs and the often more serious virus HIV that shodd not be ovedooked First of all, many of the most comtnon STIs are passed in the same way HIV is: SEX. So if you have caught an infection ftom a partner, then you m^ht cer\u00ad tainly have been exposed to HIV (if there is a chance your parmer is infected). Second, hav\u00ad ing an STI increases the chances of both^w/r^ and^tting HIV. A statistic that is often quoted is that an HIV-positive person who also faas anotfaer STI is seven times more likely to pass HIV to a partner and diat an HIV- neg;ative person vdio faas anotfaer STI is at a three to five times greater riak to contract HlV^Kifn dittt pattnets. In the comiiig months, keep an eye on this coiuinn as ^^li^discbss in greater detail the issue of sexually transmitted infections ... some in\u00ad formation you may know... some you may not ...

Reasons for Hope By David Scondras The Next Generation Soon we will have better versions of the drugs we use to stop HIV. These drugs will fight resistant drus, have fewer side effects, and be easier to take. Once a Day! Hiere is a new protease inhibitor being made by Bristol Myers Sqdbb (BMS) that looks as though it can be used once a day. For now it is called BMS23263Z It seems at kast twice as strong as any odier ptotease inhibitor, and seems able to get vird load down in peopk whose virus is resistant to three protease in\u00ad hibitors. It has kept virus to undetectable lev\u00ad ds in people who take it once a day for 48 weeks so far! Also, there has been no evidence yet of any increase in totd cholesterol or triglycerides. If the studies continue to show these things, this may be a \"kinder, gender\" protease inhibitor, with less diarrhea and much less lipodystrophy ofthe type connected with protease inhibitors. Perhaps this will also mean less impact on body shape, but this is fu- from certdn. There are other once-a-day cocktails com\u00ad ing out. One very interesting study put to\u00ad gether a cocktail combining widiout any use of protease inhibitors. (Videx now comes in a simple, small capsde that is much easier to take than the giant alka-seltzer size pill from the old dajre.) The 26 people in this study did very, very well (90 percent had low vird loads after one year). This is still preliminary, so it is not yet recommend until other studies can confirm this\u2014but it is one to watch. A new kind of drug, Gilead's Tenofovir, will also be a once-a-day drug when it is approved by the FDA. Energizer Protease Dup>ont is developing two second genera\u00ad rion protease inhibitors (DPC 681 and DPC 684) that codd work on virus that is highly resistant to ALL of thc other FDA-approved protease inhibitors. They tried these new Pi's against virus that was resistant to four or more procease inliibitors, and they lookgood agdnst all of them.

A Washington sdentist has discovered a protease inhibitor with a specid pio^ieily* No matter what HIV does, tlus protease inhibitor usually sticks to the virus and stops it. The drug is bdx^ tested by Hbotec, a dxo% company in Belgium. New NNRTIs A ^^ probkm with nnrti drugs, like Sustiva and Viramune, is that they are very cross resis\u00ad tant. This means if your vinu gets resistant co one, it ts ptobably resistant to both.

This puts you in contact with the company's com- F>a5sionate use program. Tfae eligibility for these programs is iimited, but it might be an impor\u00ad tant option for some. Entry Infaibitors Entry inhibitors stop HIV from getting into cells. These new drugs will transform the world of HIV therapy because people who have used up their options will still respond to these types of drugs. The side effects of these drugs will bc different and hopefully less serious than those ofthe drugs we use today. Ifthe studies of T20 that are now starting are successfd, Roche will bc marketing the first of the inhibitors, T-20, soon. You might call your locd study centers if this is of interest to you \u2014 anyone is eligible who has aiready had resistance devdop to at least one medicine in each of the three drug classes that we use to make up present-day cocktails, and who are ready to switch to a new combo. Future Directions Many new drugs are in the planning stage. Panacos Pharmaceuticals is working on a new powerfd kind of inhibitor, 4 methyl DCK, that works eariy in thc life cyde of HIV. AchiUon Pharmaceuticals is devdoping a new nuke that avoids mitochondrid toddties. This means it many be kss todc than drugs we take now. It dso appears to be powerfd against virus that Is very nuke resistant. It is called ACH-126,443. Triangk Pharmaceuticals is testing DAPD, a new nuke that works on virus resistant to both AZT and 3TC. Another thing on the horizon is a booster for certdn drugs. It ap\u00ad pears that mycophenolic add makes Tenofovir, ABC, and DDI stronger. Eady experimentation is showing a cocktail of DDI, Ribavarin and Interferon Alpha fight BOTH HIV and Hepatitis C! This wodd bc a vcty important discovery for the many peopk who are co-infected with Hep C and HIV. a drugis still effective at holding back the virus. These tests are called \"phenotypic and geno- typic resistance assays.\" Shortiy, the Com- monwedth of Massachusetts will be funding these tests through Medicaid. Medicare d- ready does this, as do most private insurance companies. This is verj^ good news for people whose regimens are failing and who need to know which drugs are not working. lyede Ketover is tbe executive director of Search For A Cure.

The Public Market, 280 N. Union St., was built in 1904. It has a horseshoe-shaped open shed area and an enclosed building where local growers afld vendors sell comparatively low\u00ad et >st fresh seasonal produce (mosdy not |>esri- cide-frce). Middle Eastern spices, free-range chicken and eggs, plants and flowers, seafood, baked goods, even live ducks and chickens. Clothing and all idnds of kitschy items are also on sale.

Next door to the Union Street Vendors building is a thrcc-stor}'* conunission house which now houses an art gallery on the third floor. It is fascinating to see the process of rehabilitation, with the old wheels and pulle5rs still in the ceilings, and the thick metal doors that once shielded refrigerated foods. The view ^m the gallery takes in a panorama of the Market and the city skyline beyond. The gal\u00ad lery, which does not yet have a name, will be holding shows every month. It is open Satur\u00ad days and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Further down the row of commission houses, the North East Neighborhood Alli\u00ad ance (NENA) is renovating a smaller building which will serve as offices for the Alliance, which is the Market neighborhood associa- The old commission house on the left now houses an art gallery on the third floor. Market site are now being renovated and many exciting things are to bc found there as well. A visit to the Market can include much more than merely buying next week's groceries. ^ Several of the newly-renovated buildings are at the main N. Union Street entrance to the Market. In one, the Union Street Public Mar\u00ad ket Vendors building, several entrepreneurs have set up business, includingjavaJoe's. An essential part of a Market trip is sitting at an outside table there sipping a cappuchino and watching the diverse and fascinating crowds. Another business in the buiiding is Fabu, where owner Karen Maccarone sells imported French cheeses, butter and olives, as well as bread and pastries from Mantucello's and the Litde Bak\u00ad ery. Maccarone said that she shopped at the Public Market as a small ciiild with her grand\u00ad father, and that she opened Fabu after her* divorce. \"I came here aU the rime as my litde sanctuary,\" she said. When a vendor at the Fancy Food Show in New York left his stock of imported olives, Maccarone snapped them up, and that was the b^jtming. In Paris she got the idea to start imporntig cheeses. ''Next thifig you know I was doing the bread,\" she said. Maccarone has posted a latge map of Ftance which she encourages customers to fill in with the items chey want from different location^ actoss tliat country. She hopes to go back to Ftance in the fall, and tour the country, buying those items. She will also leam how to make tion.

This represents neighlaorhood resi\u00ad dents getting more control and going into parmcrship with the city, which started after Bill Johnson became mayor.\" Rosin said that she thinks the buiiding now housing the art gallery was originaily Meyers, Foote and Davis, a commission house that handled mosdy dry goods. She said that the commission houses started going up on thc perimeter ofthe Market as eariy as 1905. Until 1929 they werc thc only entities on the Market to bc allowed to sell out-of-state produce. After 1929, trucker-dealers became more ac\u00ad tive, and in 1933, after a bitter fight, thc truckcr- deaiers werc permitted to sell out-of-state goods, which wrecked many local fanners in that Depression era, as well as putting some commission houses out of business. Earlier in the century. Rosin said, growers and cotnmission houses needed each other. Cotnmission middlefnen handled a lot oflocal produce, which was good for the fanners, and a symbiotic tdadonship was possible. In die mid-1920s the detnand for fresh produce in\u00ad creased rapidly.

The first group. Break\u00ad ing the Ice, is a support group fbr people newly coming out as gay or lesbian. Each session of Breaking the Ice will address a pardcular topic that is relevant to the coming out process, such as how does one go about com\u00ad ing out to family and friends, and i^'here does one meet other gay people for friendship and romance. The second group, Dual Attrac\u00ad tion, is for both men and women who want to explore their bisexual feelings. Like with Breaking the Ice, each session will address a particular topic, such as what does it mean to bc bisexuai, how does one effec\u00ad tively deal with biphobia in both the gay and straight communides, and how can one maintain a bisexual idendty in a committed relationship. Both groups provide pardcipants with a safe, suppordve and confi\u00ad dendal place for to dis\u00ad cuss issues which concem their sexual idendty and are led by experienced group facilitators who will provide informadon, lead exf>enendal acdvi\u00ad des, and facilitate discussion. The registradon fee for both groups is on a sliding scale from $25 to $50 for the entire six sessions. However, no one will be tumed away because of lack of funds. Scholar\u00adships are available to those indi\\ddu- als who cannot afford the entire fee.

His piacement is with East House, assisting a Rochestcr City Schooi District teacher who is pre\u00ad paring students to take the GED exam. GAGV: When did you first be\u00ad cotne acquainted with the GAGV? SH: I first became involved with the GAGV as a student at the Uni\u00ad versity of Rochestcr. A member of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Friends Association convinced some of us to help her put together a Stu\u00ad dent Speaker's Bureau for the U/R campus community. Around the same dme, another member was spearheading a new campus program, known as Safe Zone. While woridng on these projects, we sought support and guidance from thc GAGV, which led its to discover the GAGV Community Educadon Project. We ail went through the train\u00ading, and then utilized thc newly formed campus speaker's bureau to educate faculty and staff who wanted to bc involved in the Safe Zone program. It worked out beautifully. GAGV: How long and in what capacities have you volunteered with thc GAGV? SH: I graduated from U/R in May 2000, and returned to the area in the fall, where I continued to be in\u00ad volved with the Community Educa\u00ad tion Project. Then this spring, partially through my involvement with the Rochester AmeriCorps, I i>egan volunteering in another capacity. Each week I volunteer for a few hours compil\u00ad ing statistics on a number of the programs and services the GAGV offers. GAGV: What has been particu\u00ad larly rewafding about volunteer\u00ad ing a trainer with the Conunu\u00ad nity Education Project? SH: Serving on the Community Educarion Project has been one of the best tilings I liave ever done. Besides the obvious sadsfacdon of educating people about the GLBT scale from $10 to $20. Schoiarsiiips are available for those individuals who cannot afford the entire fee. To register, please call Tanya at the GAGV at 244-8640.
