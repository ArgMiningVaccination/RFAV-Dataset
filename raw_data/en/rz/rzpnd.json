On 11 April 2011, the Mayor considered a report on t his proposal, our reference PDU/ 1983a/01 . A copy of the report is attached in full. This letter comprises the statement that the Mayor is required to provide under Article 4(2) of the Order. The Mayor consid ers that whilst, in principle , the application is generally acceptable in strategic planning terms, it does not fully comply with the London Plan for the reasons set out in paragraph 65 of the above -mentioned report; but that the possible remedies set out in paragraph 67of this report could address these deficiencies. The application represents EIA development for the purposes of the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) (England and Wales) Regulations 1999. The environmental information made available to date has been taken into consideration in formulating these comments. If your Council subsequently resolves to grant permission on the application, it must consult the Mayor again under Article 5 of the Order and allow him fourteen days to decide whether to allow the draft decis ion to proceed unchanged, or direct the Council under Articl e 6 to refuse the application. You should therefore send me a copy of any representations made in respect of the application, a copy of the officer's report to your planning committee , together wi th a statement of the decision your authority proposes to make ; a statement of any conditions the authority proposes Chhaya Patel Department of Planning & Transportation City of London P.O. Box 270 Guildhall Date: 11 April, 2011 - 2 - to impose and (if applicable) a draft of any planning obligation it proposes to enter into and detai ls of any proposed planning contributio n. If your Council resolves to refuse permission it need not consult the Mayor again (pursuant to Article 5(2) of the Order), and your Council may therefore proceed to determine the application without further reference to the GLA. However, you should sti ll send a copy of the decision notice to the Mayor, pursuant to Article 5 (3) of the Order. Please note that the Transport for London case officer for this application is Patricia Charleton , who can be reached on telephone number 0207 126 4617 .
