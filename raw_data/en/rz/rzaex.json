And what began as a health crisis rapidly escalated into a global social and economic crisis. While the pandemic spared no one, one of the hardest hit were the socioeconomically disadvantaged people, who struggled with livelihood concerns of unemployment, wages and starvation. Moved by their predicament, Isha volunteers initially began with critical interventions in our surrounding villages by offering nutritious food, daily essentials and immunity-boosting herbal drinks along with creating awareness on COVID protocols, conducting vaccination camps, and providing medical aid and assistance to the needy. But as the severity and reach of the second wave of the pandemic increased daily, we were impelled to extend our interventions to parts of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Puducherry, working closely with governments and hospitals in an endeavor to alleviate suffering on a larger scale. As we were fighting one battle against COVID, our effort to save our planet and the farmers who sustain us was not forgotten. Adhering to COVID protocols, Cauvery Calling volunteers kept the massive campaign on track. They helped more than 50,000 farmers to shift to tree-based agriculture and 21 million trees were planted in the last 2 years. Our rural education project, Isha Vidhya, was taken online to beat the lockdown and ensure that the light of education reached every student's home. Our teachers designed innovative learning sessions for virtual classes while experts from varied fields mentored our students. I have had the privilege of working closely with Sadhguru for several years and have often heard him say that what the world throws at us is not always our choice, but what we make out of it is one hundred percent our choice. These pages reflect the choices we made in the year of the pandemic. I am delighted to share with you Anukampa 2021, which includes inspirational stories, facts and figures from our various human service projects that encourage individual growth, revitalize the human spirit, rebuild communities, and restore the environment. None of this would have been possible without the generosity and compassion of our donors and the committed involvement of our volunteers.

Launched in 2017 by Sadhguru to revitalize India's rapidly depleting rivers, the campaign garnered the support of over 162 million people, and helped in the formulation of government policy for river revitalization. RfR provided a dramatic impetus to the scaling up of Isha's 23-year grassroot work, now being What Makes Cauvery Calling So Extraordinary?implemented as Cauvery Calling. Cauvery Calling is the world's largest farmer-driven ecological movement promoting tree- based agriculture on private farmlands in the Cauvery river basin spanning Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. It seeks to simultaneously solve three of the most critical, long-term problems that face India - depleting water, dwindling soil fertility and the impoverished state of millions of farmers. 2.42 billion trees to be planted 5.2 million farmers to benefit 3-8 times boost to farmers' incomes estimated 1/3rd of the 83,000 km2 river basin to be brought under green cover 9-12 trillion liters of water to be sequestered 40% depletion of the Cauvery river to be combated 200-300 million tonnes of CO2 to be sequestered 8-12% of India's targets for 2030 under the Paris Agreement Anukampa 2021 | 13Economy and Ecology have been at loggerheads for too long. Cauvery Calling is an effort to marry them for a robust economy, the wellbeing of farmers, and a sustainable planet. This will be a model not just for India but for the entire tropical world. From Grassroots A Nadi Veera, or River Champion, in a remote village in Karnataka, educating farmers on why they should move to tree-based agriculture.\" Anukampa 2021 | 14Cauvery Calling Is ON - Despite the COVID-19 Pandemic 21 million+ trees planted during the two years of the pandemic 50,000+ farmers shifted to tree- based agriculture 5 plantation drives in Tamil Nadu since July 2021 1,800 farmer outreach events 890 Mara Mitras - youth from rural communities trained to handhold farmers 5.5 million farmers watched our videos on social media 400,000 farmers of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka engaged every month on Facebook pages 128 WhatsApp groups nurturing 12,000 farmers 16,000+ farmers trained during the pandemicNo question of interfering in Cauvery Calling: Karnataka High Court Judgement The Karnataka High Court appreciated the steps taken by Isha Outreach for tree-based agriculture through Cauvery Calling, dismissing a frivolous Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition that alleged saplings were being planted on public lands. \"We are of the considered opinion that afforestation has become very necessary keeping in view the present scenario and such activities need appreciation rather than putting spokes in projects like Cauvery Calling.\" - Division Bench, Karnataka High App With the Cauvery Koogu - Mara Mitra Mobile App, large-scale implementation of tree-based agriculture is no longer a dream! The Cauvery Calling team has trained 890 youth from rural communities (Mara Mitras, or Friends of Trees) to handhold farmers to adopt tree-based agriculture using the App. The App was launched on September 2 in the Bengaluru Vidhana Sabha (State Legislative Assembly). The Story So Far The Karnataka Government supports farmers through various schemes like KAPY, MGNREGS, NBM, NHM, etc. But these government schemes are underutilized due to lack of awareness and support at the ground level. For instance, to facilitate farmers' registration for the schemes, Forest Officers have to manually collect information from farmers such as cropping patterns, sapling species, landholding details, etc. Each Officer spends 60-90 minutes per farmer to record this information. A tiresome process: Farmers queue up to register for schemes at the Forest Office Always a challenge: Government unable to correctly estimate sapling demandWhen hard work doesn't pay off: Farmers not receiving deserved incentivesRegister, Educate and Empower Farmers at Their Doorstep Anukampa 2021 | 17What Are We Unlocking with the App? In a nutshell, the app will hasten this process of data gathering and farmers' registrations. Using the app, Mara Mitras will record the data and directly make it available to the Forest Department nurseries to facilitate the production of high-quality saplings at the right time, in the right place and in the right numbers. The app will also ensure that farmers receive their incentives in a timely manner. How Does It Work? Enabling farmers at their doorstep: Using the app, Mara Mitras can enroll farmers in government schemes without having to visit the Range Forest Offices. Estimating sapling demand: The app records the exact number of saplings requested by farmers for each species mitigating the risk of under or over- production by government nurseries. Survival surveys: Using the app, Mara Mitras will conduct survival surveys, geo- tag the plants, and upload the coordinates and images to government databases. This will ensure timely disbursement of incentives to farmers for surviving saplings under the schemes. Trust and transparency: The government can verify farmers' requirements and also directly credit incentives to farmers' bank accounts. Using this app, Mara Mitras help maintain the farmers. Educating farmers: The app training modules help Mara Mitras to guide farmers to choose the right sapling species as per the land profile of their farms. One stop shop: Educating farmers on types of soil, suitable crops and government schemes Technology, the way forward: Geo-tagging crops to enable incentives for farmers Government schemes find traction: Underutilized schemes see higher registrations Anukampa 2021 | 18Massive Village Outreach for the 2022 Planting Season 8 weeks 1,800 events 1,785 gram panchayats 57 taluks 9 Cauvery basin districts home to 2.4 million farmers 890 Mara Mitras The outreach culminated with Mara Mitras generating a demand of 20 million saplings for the next planting season, under different government schemes, using the app!The Cauvery Calling team, in collaboration with Karnataka's Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department (RDPR) and the State's forest, horticulture and sericulture departments, launched a massive on-ground campaign on 2 August. Anukampa 2021 | 19Forest to Farm, the Way Forward Celebrating Cauvery Calling's success in the 2020 planting season \"Our job is to ensure that people live better; to ensure physical progress is the job of politicians. But Sadhguru's work begins where our work ends; he tells us how to live.\" - Shri Prakash Javadekar, (then) Union Minister for Environment, Forests & Climate Change as well as Information and Broadcasting together to celebrate Cauvery Calling. Emphasizing that the way forward is \"from forest to farm,\" Sadhguru said that we must remove the term \"forest produce\" from our vocabulary and see that, instead of exploiting the forests, whatever we need must be grown on our own farmlands. \"I would like to congratulate Sadhguru ji and Isha Outreach on the Cauvery Calling movement and assure that the government will support it in every way.\" - Shri B.S. Yediyurappa, (then) Chief Minister of Karnataka\"In the name of development and urbanization, we are creating concrete jungles.

In 2021, apart from the regular distribution of organically grown saplings by our nurseries, we conducted plantation drives to mark various important days of the year for the farming community. The nursery operations are supported by over 300 women from rural communities in nearby villages.Plantation with \"Friends of Trees\": 13 August Doctors, nurses, medical students and members of the \"Friends of Trees\"' movement came together to plant saplings on Dr. Indumati Kalaiyarasan's farm in Kottapatti village.

The 700 papaya trees that I have intercropped with teak trees generate an income of Rs. 5 lakh. In this way, I have optimized my resources and ensured that I earn a steady income all year round. And of course, the high-value timber trees that will later fetch a large sum of money when felled have secured my future!\" A Volunteer \"Volunteering for Cauvery Calling is the best experience I ever had.\" - Ranjan, Nadi Veera, Bangalore \"I did my undergrad from IIT Bombay and joined the Cauvery Calling team, inspired by the plan to plant 2.42 billion trees within 12 years. This is a big plan. Volunteers like me are on the ground to create awareness amongst farmers about tree-based agriculture and its benefits for soil, crops and income. When we visit zilla panchayats, taluk panchayats and gram panchayats to reach farmers, we find that they are not aware and are very worried about their income. My role is to communicate effectively and make them understand why we're here and what the Cauvery Calling project is all about, what the farmers are going to get and how it will impact all the people there. This is the work more than 1,000 volunteers have committed their lives to accomplish and I'm sure that we will succeed!\" Tree-based agriculture has changed the life of Shankar, who owns a small farm in Sadayampattu village. He says: \"A farmer who cultivates multiple crops among timber trees in his farm earns throughout the year. Initially, I only cultivated cash crops like other farmers and was hounded by financial troubles. Then in 2019, I learnt about tree-based agriculture from Isha and planted 400 timber trees to increase my income. Since the trees would take time to be ready for harvest, I started cultivating agathi plants in the gaps between the trees. I now harvest agathi 5 times a year and earn an annual income of Rs. 75,000.

A powerful testimony to the effectiveness of the campaign was noticed when a farmer in Nidasale gram panchayat, Tumkur, got up in the middle of an awareness-building event, walked towards the TV that was playing the Cauvery Calling video, and reverently bowed down before the screen. In a touching expression of gratitude, Lokesh, a farmer from Mandya, took some Cauvery Calling volunteers to his farm where he had planted 18 Rakta Chandana trees. He cooked lunch for the volunteers and served everyone himself.

The project demonstrates a large-scale model, showcasing that in 10 to 12 years' time, we can significantly revitalize a major river, mitigate carbon emissions and simultaneously multiply farmers' incomes by planting trees on private farmland. The project has been through two planting seasons and now with the pandemic under control, the time has come to ramp up our efforts multifold in the coming years. Without your financial support for educating, mobilizing and handholding farmers as well as raising saplings, none of this will be possible.

Your encounter with this premium, traditional paddy variety - Karuppu Kavuni Arisi, or black rice - is bound to be memorable for more reasons than one. Black rice crops grow to a height of 5-7 feet, while the modern lab-grown paddy varieties are 1.5-1.6 feet tall. It is fondly referred to as \"Black Magic\" by the farmers because the net income earned by selling this variety of rice is much more than other paddy varieties. Black rice fetches more than Rs. 200/kg in the local market while with proper marketing it can fetch up to Rs. 500/kg in the urban markets. Once reserved for kings, royals and aristocrats, Karuppu Kavuni is a class apart as it is full of dietary fiber and antioxidants, offers better nutrition, encourages natural farming and also feeds cattle. As a pilot project of IAM, black rice was cultivated on 4 acres of farmland in Semmedu. Encouraged by its success, the area of cultivation has now been increased to 10 acres! Natural farming is the need of the hour. And the lush green paddy fields of Isha Agro Movement in Semmedu make an emphatic statement about the far-reaching benefits of natural farming methods that strike a balance between economic gains and ecological conservation.

I started farming 15 years ago, and on my 25 acres of land, I have grown coconut, cocoa, banana, sapota and mango crops along with timber trees like neem, teak and mahogany. And, yet I felt that something more could be cultivated on the land, but I didn't know how to do it and which crop would be best. \"At this juncture, I learnt about the 'Pepper Cultivation in Plains' training that was being conducted by IAM. Till then, I was doubtful if pepper can grow on plains. During the training, it became clear that pepper thrives and is cultivated better in the plains! \"Using the techniques that I learnt in the tutorial, I planted Karimunda and Baniyura pepper varieties as intercrops. It's been four years and they are just beginning to yield. Planting the pepper crops has also improved the micro-climate of the farm.

Despite a pocket of resistance and hesitancy towards the vaccine, our COVID warriors were on the field, day and night, to persuade the villagers. A taskforce of Isha volunteers, doctors and injectors oversaw the arrangements and ensured strict adherence to pandemic protocols. 7 mega camps 25 villages 3,400+ vaccinated 41 village level camps 2,500+ vaccinated Anukampa 2021 | 60The Lives We Touched \"No matter if it was day or night, Isha volunteers went door to door to create awareness amongst people about vaccines.\" - Devi, Nurse, Mullangadu Village \"I am working as a nurse in Isha's hospital. Recently, Ikkarai Boluvampatti Panchayat and Isha together conducted a vaccination survey. When they found that nobody was vaccinated, Isha volunteers went door to door to create awareness about the vaccine and explained how it is safe to get vaccinated. Isha along with the Panchayat made sure that each and every person in the village got vaccinated. By doing this, 98% of the villagers got their first dose of vaccination. People also started inquiring about when the second dose of vaccination was going to happen. I'm going to work day and night to make sure that my community is fully vaccinated.\" \"We reached people door to door because of which the tribal and village communities were greatly benefited.\" - M. Selvaraj, Health Inspector, Pooluvapatti PHC \"Since the pandemic started in 2020, the Health Ministry has been facing immense difficulties in serving the community. During this time, Isha came forward to support us in a big way. Whatever services they took up, they are continuing all of them till date. They were always ready, no matter what time it was, always willing to do what was needed. They have taken this as their responsibility to serve the Thondamuthur block. On behalf of the PHC and the health ministry, we are immensely thankful to Isha.\" Anukampa 2021 | 61Kayantha Sthanam As we have responsibilities for the living, we have responsibilities towards the dead. Over the last century, certain significant rituals pertaining to the \"journey beyond\" have lost their fundamental essence. At Kayantha Sthanams (crematoriums), Isha has revived ancient traditions and death rituals with a powerful energy basis, conducting them in the spirit of service rather than as a commercial venture. With appropriate chants and karmas to benefit the departed, the processes are performed with sensitivity and awareness to ease the hearts of the family of the deceased. \" Anukampa 2021 | 62Dignity in Death A dedicated group of Isha volunteers, including brahmacharis and ashram residents, stepped up to keep the Kayantha Sthanams fully operational for the last one year. As volunteers and staff placed themselves at risk every day, Isha's crematorium services increasingly gained the respect and admiration of thousands in the community. 771 cremations were offered free of cost as part of Dignity in Death. Cremation services Operating 16 crematoriums in partnership with the State GovernmentTransportation of the deceased Our mortuary vans have been used to transport the deceasedAs the second wave of COVID-19 swept India, an acute shortage of well-equipped crematoriums, hearse services and other resources prevented families from giving a dignified farewell to their loved ones and also posed a critical challenge for administrations. In these traumatic times, we embarked on the \"Dignity in Death\" initiative, where cremation services were offered free of cost. Last rites Time and assistance offered to family members to help them pay their last respects, while adhering to safety protocols. Anukampa 2021 | 63\"The relatives of the departed shared that they experienced a temple-like atmosphere and a sense of peace and fulfilment at the Kayantha Sthanam.\" - Swami Abhipada \"The bereaved are in a deep state of grief and sometimes face unpleasant situations in other crematoriums because workers may exploit the situation and demand money. At the Kayantha Sthanam, we want to eliminate this and ensure that the last journey of the departed is conducted without any hassles. \"During the COVID-19 crisis, many people lost their loved ones and our focus was on making sure that the last rites were conducted in a sensitive manner for each one of the deceased. Sadhguru had told us that respect and dignity must be maintained and only then the purpose of offering this service would be fulfilled. \"When relatives of the departed came to the crematorium, we oriented everyone before they entered the premises. Many of them shared, 'You are maintaining a temple-like atmosphere, this is beyond our expectations. We cannot thank you enough for this service.' Offering dignity in death at the Kayantha Sthanams was a deeply fulfilling experience for me.\" Anukampa 2021 | 64Padam, or feet, of Kalabhairava, a fierce form of Shiva who is the time keeper of life, at the Isha Crematorium. Isha currently operates 16 crematoriums in partnership with the State Government, providing necessary infrastructure: Infrastructure for performing last rites in a traditional way Automated LPG furnace for efficient cremations A conducive and peaceful ambience with a lush green garden An Appeal This project aims to develop and maintain eco- friendly crematorium facilities across Tamil Nadu, which are open to people of all socio-economic and religious backgrounds. The subsidized and fixed fees keep cremations very affordable. Currently, if you visit cremation centers throughout India, you will find these sacred spaces have devolved into scenes of neglect: ramshackle structures, indifferent and stigmatized staff members, polluted and degraded natural environments. Help us revive our ancient tradition. Sadhguru's vision is to adopt and beautify 1,000-3,000 crematoriums across India.

It is very convenient for us, especially old people, to get ourselves checked up.\" - Mani, Mathampatty \"I am a diabetic, and about a year ago, I suddenly developed a skin allergy, itching and painful rashes on my forearms. Being a 70-year-old man with limited resources, a monthly pension of Rs. 8,000 is my only source of income. Physical and financial constraints prevented me from going to a doctor for treatment and I kept suffering in silence. A driver who lives nearby one day told me about Isha's MHC. The doctors gave me a combination of allopathic and Siddha medicines, free of cost, after which my rashes almost completely disappeared. I received quality medical attention at my doorstep and saved time and money. Some of my neighbors even underwent free cataract surgery in an eye camp conducted jointly by Isha and Aravind Eye Hospital. \"Even during the pandemic, the MHCs provided medicines to chronic patients, supported government hospitals and COVID-19 vaccination camps. I was amazed at how the volunteers even went door to door to distribute medicines to villagers. The MHC van coming to our village is a real blessing and I applaud them for the service they are rendering.\" Anukampa 2021 | 68Medical Camps Bring a Wave of Health to Rural Communities Arokiya Alai (Wave of Health) is a grassroots public health awareness campaign introduced in 2008, to spread awareness among rural communities on nutrition, disease prevention, hygiene and sanitation, and to offer simple, free-of-cost dietary solutions to help eradicate malnutrition. However, due to the second wave of the pandemic, the medical camps could not be held until August 2021. The camps were resumed from September, after ensuring strict adherence to pandemic protocols. Diabetic Camp On 19 September, Arokiya Alai was conducted for diabetic patients in the Salem IRHC. The intervention program offered medical consultations, food and lifestyle changes, Yogic practices and demonstrations of different types of millets which can be used as substitutes for rice. Children's Day Camp On 14 November, a multi-specialty health camp was organized for children. This included ENT, neurology, orthopedics and dental check-ups as well as Yoga sessions. Drawing competitions and games introduced an element of playfulness for the young ones. Screening Camps Three screening camps to identify symptoms of life-threatening diseases were also held at several villages. These offered dental and eye checkups along with examination for orthopedics, cardio, obstetrics, gynecology and dermatology. Isha volunteers also spread awareness about basic healthcare and introduced Yoga to the rural communities to help them achieve a balance in their body, mind, and spirit. Anukampa 2021 | 69Rural and Tribal Welfare If your humanity is in full flow, you will reach out to life around you. This is not morality - this is the nature of being human.

I used to hesitate while even speaking in English, but Isha helped me to get admission in a reputed college and now I don't have any such fear. With the help of Isha's scholarship, I was able to complete B.Com without any financial woes. When I was studying, I had to incur petty expenses. Isha helped me in that, too, by arranging a part-time job. Since my grandmother doesn't know a lot about my studies, Isha volunteers acted like my guardians in college and often approached college authorities and figured things out for me. I focused on my studies, while Isha took care of the rest. I doubt if I could have finished my education had Isha not helped me with the scholarship.\" Government Scholarships for Our Students The National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme (NMMSS) is a Central Government scholarship exam, for which we conducted training programs across 6 villages during the pandemic.

Every month, we would receive a salary from Rs. 8-15,000 from our shop. In addition to this, we split the profit every 6 months. Initially, my first profit share was Rs. 15,000. The second time, it was Rs. 50,000. My husband's childhood dream was to buy a refrigerator. He didn't want his children to be deprived of such things. So from the first share, we bought a fridge. Using the second share, we constructed two additional rooms in our house. From the most recent share, we were able to buy a grinder and a mixer. \"My dream is to educate my children in an English medium school. My son is now in Class 1 at Isha Vidhya, studying for free on a scholarship. I am very happy that my son studies in Isha Vidhya.

The objective is to revive more than 136 unique weaves indigenous to rural India by adopting looms and weaving clusters, facilitating the use of natural dyes, and developing market access. This movement is just as much about reinstating the use of natural and handmade fabrics over synthetic and machine- made ones as it is about realizing the impact our clothing has on our mental and physical wellbeing.

I grew coconuts, and up until two years ago, I used to rely on flood irrigation at my farm. But I often noticed that the water level in my well would suddenly drop, affecting my harvest. \"I was one of the first farmers to become a member of Velliangiri Uzhavan when it was established by Isha in 2013. Two years ago, with their help, I installed a drip irrigation system on my farm. I am not only impressed with the results but also the speed with which it was set up. From A to Z, everything was taken care of. I just called Moorthy sir (Agricultural Advisor) and he came in person and set everything up in one day. \"Since then, I observed noticeable improvements in the crop, soil quality, groundwater levels and temperature of the farm. The number of earthworms has increased and the soil has become loose and porous. Earlier, the land used to heat up and the rate of evaporation was very high. After I switched to drip irrigation, it became much cooler. The land stays moist and evenly irrigated, and the water in the well is maintained at the same level throughout the year. \"Earlier, I would harvest 100 coconuts per tree, now I get 120 coconuts. The coconuts used to weigh 450 grams each, now one coconut weighs 517 grams. All this has led to a substantial increase in my income - this has happened only because of Velliangiri Uzhavan.\" An Appeal A change in the farming culture from \"I\" to \"We\" has been one of the greatest impacts of Velliangiri Uzhavan. Poised to be the engine of change that rural India needs, this initiative aims to support farming communities to organize themselves into profitable enterprises. We look forward to partnering with committed organizations to empower the farmers of the nation and build an India that will be a model of inclusiveness, where agriculture is a sustainable source of livelihood.
