Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on May 09, 2019 Gemstones are Mother Nature's natural healers and are a delight to give and receive. By gifting someone with a crystal, you are also offering healing. There are hundreds of different types of stones to choose from, and exploring them and discovering the perfect gemstone for you can be fun. The following 10 stones are must-haves for your amulet healing pouch or display on your crystal altar. You should also include any stones that you feel an attraction toward; this psychic affinity is a sign that these gems hold special healing powers. Be sure to cleanse gemstones as you acquire them, as well as routinely cleansing those that are already in your collection. Rose Quartz De Agostini / G. Cigolini / Getty Images With its gentle energy, rose quartz is sometimes known as the loving stone because it opens the wearer to love in all forms: platonic, sexual, and spiritual. It is a healer of physical heart ailments as well as emotional heartbreaks. Rose quartz is a timely gift to offer someone who desires to learn self-love or seeks to find inner peace. Fluorite Melissa Carroll / Getty Images Fluorite comes in a variety of colors and is known as the protector gemstone for its ability to ward off negative energy, especially from other people. Fluorite can also help the wearer find spiritual tranquility and can aid in meditation. Cleanse your fluorite at least once a week when using it as a protective helper. Lapis Lazuli De Agostini / G. Cigolini / Getty Images Lapis lazuli has been said to unlock mysteries by helping the wearer or carrier eliminate confusion and emotional blockage. Lapis is also thought to be the gemstone that links the material and celestial realms, revealing the wonders of the cosmos to those seeking its healing energy. Hematite Matteo Chinellato - ChinellatoPhoto / Getty Images Hematite is a grounding stone. This silver-gray metallic gemstone is often used as a grounding tool to aid those who tend to avoid worldly tasks or events by out-of-body flight. If you're going to be in a stressful situation, such as a funeral or job interview, try slipping a piece of hematite in your pocket. You'll feel more comfortable as this gemstone spreads its healing energy. Jade Lonely Planet / Getty Images Jade carries serene and calming energy, helping a person to find self-acceptance and inner calm. This healing stone can also help the wearer understand dream symbolism and tap inner creativity. It can also relieve physical pain such as cramps and help flush toxins from the body. Amethyst MvH / Getty Images Amethyst has powerful healing qualities, both physical and spiritual. This gemstone imparts a sense of calm and balance, clearing the mind of confusion and soothing negative or stressful emotions. It can balance hormone levels and strengthen the immune system. Turquoise Danita Delimont / Getty Images Turquoise has long been revered as a healing stone by Native Americans in the southwestern U.S., who valued it for its ability to help interpret dreams, ward off evil, and strengthen love and friendship bonds. Wearing turquoise can give a person a sense of confidence in public and also impart wisdom. Kyanite Gary Ombler / Getty Images Kyanite helps facilitate channeling and opens communications centers to enable contact with spirit guides and angels. Kyanite is probably best known for its balancing properties that align the chakras, especially the throat chakra. There is no need to cleanse this stone; it clears itself automatically of negative energies. Obsidian Gary Ombler / Getty Images All varieties of obsidian can be used as grounding and protective agents. The snowflake obsidian helps people surrender or let go of negative habits or past pathways that no longer serve their present condition. It can bring about the opportunity for change, serenity, and clarity. Citrine Melissa Carroll / Getty Images Citrine is a wonderful yellow stone to carry because it helps to manifest your goals. This energizing crystal also keeps its bearer cheerful because it is filled with empowering solar energy. Citrine attracts abundance and personal power, much as yellow topaz does.
