Following comments by the Commi ttee in 2006 the guidance has been extensively revised, assi sted by a small drafting gr oup set up by the FSA to consider the comments arising from the public consultation undertaken in 2004. The drafting group also took the opportunity to look in more detail at specific areas where the guidance needed to be updated to reflect changes that have taken place over the 15 y ears since the ACMSF first issued its advice. The Agency has circulated the revised guidance to industry stakeholders for further comment, before finalising the final version which is attached. The ACMSF is invited to: Comment on the finalised version of the guidance document which the FSA anticipates will be publ ished early in 2008. Background 1. The attached document relates to the food safety aspects of the manufacture of vacuum and modifi ed atmosphere packaged (VP/MAP) chilled foods, with resp ect to non-proteolytic Clostridium botulinum . 2. The Food Standards Agency guidance is a concise summary of the advice from the Advisory Committee on t he Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF) in its Report on Vacuum Packaging and Associated Processes (1992) 1, more recent recommendations from the Committee (ACMSF 2006)2 and existing information contained in the Code of Practice for the Manufacture of Vacu um and Modified Atmosphere Packaged Chilled Foods (1996)3. The guidance was drafted in response to a request made by the ACMSF to make the existing guidance more accessible and relevant to manufacturers and retaile rs of chilled VP/MAP foods, and to Local Authorities carrying out their enforcement duties. 1 Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food. Report on Vacuum Packaging and Associated Processes, 1992. HMSO, London. 2 Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food. Annual Report 2006. Published by the FSA, August 2007, FSA/1191/0807 3 Campden and Chorleywood Food Research Association. Gu ideline No. 11: A Code of Practice for the Manufacture of Vacuum and Modified Atmospher e Packaged Chilled Foods; May 1996. 3. The Committee agreed at the 18th September 2003 m eeting that the document should go out to a full public consultation. The consultation raised a number of concerns , and in particular uncerta inty relating to the 5 day shelf-life rule for VP/MAP chil led foods. The ACMSF recommended the Food Standards Agency commissi on an independent review of C. botulinum in VP/MAP chilled foods to enab le the Committee to consider the evidence further. 4. At its meeting held 8 th June 2006 the ACMSF considered the findings of the independent review of C. botulinum in VP/MAP chilled foods and recommended the 10 Day shelf-life rule for VP/MAP chilled foods. The Committee also recommended the setting up of a small drafting group by the Food Standards Agency to consi der how the guidance could be revised to reflect further issues ra ised by the public consultation. The VP/MAP Drafting Group was est ablished in October 2006. 5. The Drafting Group in cluded representatives from the Chilled Food Association, Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, British Retail Consortium, Campden and Chorleywo od Food Research Association, Institute of Food Research, the f ood packaging industry and the Food Standards Agency. 6. The remit of the Drafting Group was to re-consider the guidance in light of the comments received through the public consultation and, where appropriate, take account of developm ents since publicati on of the 1992 ACMSF report. Such developments include: Widening the scope to reference HACCP principles Make reference to current re gulations (e.g. EC 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs) Include advice on technical issues (e.g. re-wrapping VP/MAP products) Reference currently available microbiological growth models Take account of current industry practice (e.g. Table 1 provides equivalent lethality of 90 oC for 10 mins up to a temperature of 100oC) Include more specific advice for Enforcement Officers and Food Business Operators. 7. Over the summer of 2007 the revis ed guidance was circulated to industry stakeholders for further comment prior to completion of the final version which is attached. When the guidance is published the Agency will draw it to the attention of relevant stakeholders including the European Commission. 8. The Advisory Committee is asked to comment on the final version of the guidance which the FSA anticipates will be published early in 2008. Secretariat December 2007 "}
