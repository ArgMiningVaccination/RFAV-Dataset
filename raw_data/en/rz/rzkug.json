Debate on in Karnataka Allopathic doctors, on the other hand, are aghast with this move by the state government even if it is just an idea. They say that for a newborn, there can be no substitute to mother's milk. In Short - Department of Ayush planned to administer Swarna Bindu Prashana to newborns - They have now referred the matter to an expert committee - Debate on between Ayurvedic and allopathy doctors People always want their children to be in the best of health right from the time they are born. So does the government of Karnataka and hence they came up with a plan to administer an Ayurvedic concoction to newborns to build their immunity. Their proposal was to administer Swarna Bindu Prashana, which is one of the 16 essential rituals described in ayurveda for children. There were plans in the AYUSH department to send a proposal to the National Health Mission requesting for funds to begin this process in 2017 itself. But their idea has taken a backseat after they were challenged to prove its efficacy in building the immunity of children. Raj Kishore Singh, Director, Government of Karnataka, Department of AYUSH, tells India Today that they have come across reports that its efficacy is doubtful and hence did not include this in the National Health Mission plan from the state. He added that a committee of experts has been constituted who will go into the details and then submit a report. \"Basically it is for enhancing the immunity of the newborn but subsequently we have heard that it might be injurious so we set up the committee,\" he said. AYURVEDIC DOCTORS ELATED Ayurvedic doctors swear by this concoction and want the state government to make this is a reality. They claim that Swarna Bindu is purified ash of gold and is administered with fortified ghee prepared with herbal extract and honey in liquid or semi solid form on the Nakshatra day of the Hindu calendar every month. They say that this helps boost the immunity of children and also prevent many diseases. \"Instead of giving Triple Antigen vaccine and polio drops to children, this will help,\" says Dr KC Ballal, a noted Ayurvedic doctor who has his clinic in Malleshwaram. He however tells India Today that if the preparation of this concoction is not done according to the ancient texts, then it's very dangerous. ALLOPATHY DOCTORS SAY 'NO' Allopathic doctors, on the other hand, are aghast with this move by the state government even if it is just an idea. They say that for a newborn, there can be no substitute to mother's milk. Dr Yogesh Kumar Gupta, Consultant Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at Fortis Hospital, says that mother's milk has a lot of immunity factors that help the baby fight infections and apart from whatever the baby can fight with this immunity it has acquired from its mother, they are vaccinated to fight against particular diseases. Modern medicine according to him does not use the term generalised immunity and hence different vaccines to treat different diseases. Dr Gupta is completely against giving any medication to newborns and children that contain heavy metals in them such as gold and Swarna Bindu Prashana has purified ash of gold in it. \"These heavy metals can cause problems like bone marrow depression and immune dysfunction than building up the immunity,\" he added. He cites the example of polio drops wherein a lot of study and research has gone into it for years together. But with this ayurvedic concoction, he wants to know where is the proof, facts and research that it helps build up immunity. Once they know it's safe then nobody will have a problem but till then it's a strict no. "}
