Acupuncture involves the insertion of single-use, sterilized needles into acupuncture points throughout the body. Most acupuncture needles are as thin as human hair. You don't feel anything in most points where the needles are inserted. Most acupuncture points are found along meridians or channels that are considered to be the pathway for the flow of energy or \"Qi\" How does it work? Acupuncture aims at causing a healing reaction in the body itself. Acupuncture is not to treat diseases directly. It helps the body itself cure the disease by acupuncture stimulation inducing a healing response. In other words, it makes our body's natural healing system work. The human body's natural healing system starts to work when the parasympathetic nerve of the autonomic nervous system is stimulated. The body is under the control of the parasympathetic nerve, which promotes a relaxation response and a healing response as well. The human body self-diagnoses and heals itself with the help of acupuncture. Acupuncture helps the body get back into balance. Acupuncture treatment makes qi (vital energy) smooth. By controlling the energy flow it has the positive effect of adjusting the balance among the internal organs and curing some diseases of the body as well. Acupuncture is highly effective in relieving pain in a way to stimulate the release of the body's natural pain-relieving chemicals. This effect can be 1000 times stronger than morphine. Acupuncture assists in the contraction or expansion of the blood vessels and facilitates blood circulation. It helps prevent or treat vascular disease. Acupuncture has a significant impact on metabolism. It helps urination, moves the bowels and promotes or inhibits perspiration. It can also aid in weight loss or gain depending on body constitution.

Sometimes you may feel lightheaded if you have an empty stomach or from laying in a face-down position during the treatment. Please have a light meal before treatment and take your time getting up and move gently after treatment. - Rigorous exercise, sexual activities, eating a full meal, and consuming alcohol should be avoided immediately after a treatment for at least 6 hours. - The frequency of treatment will depend upon your individual needs. I recommend attending treatment at least once a week for three to six consecutive weeks. - For health maintenance or preventative care, I recommend treatment once or twice a month. Contraindications to Acupuncture: It is generally safe to have acupuncture, but you should let your acupuncturist know if you are pregnant because some acupuncture points should be avoided during pregnancy for safety. Patients who have a pacemaker should not be treated with electro-acupuncture. Please notify your acupuncturist if you are taking blood thinners such as Warfarin (Coumadin) or if you have hemophilia.
