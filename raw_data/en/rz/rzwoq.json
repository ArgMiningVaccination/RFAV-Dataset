This conference is an annual rite of passage for all BU BME seniors, and culminates our year-long Senior Design Project Program. Our Senior Design program is recognized as a national model for the capstone independent design and communication experience for BME under - graduates. T o maintain our high standards while staying safe, this year's conference will be virtual with live presentations followed by interactive question-and-answer periods. Over the course of the day, our talented students will present their state-of- the-art designs through oral presentations, as they complete their BS degrees from one of the top Biomedical Engineering programs. Biomedical Engineering synthesizes engineering, computation, math and physica l sciences with the life sciences to advance our understanding of biology, physiology and the medical sciences. This knowledge is then leveraged to develop new devic - es and methods to improve healthcare, and accelerate cutting-edge research. Our ABET-accredited BS degree program in Biomedical Engineering is one of the oldest such programs in the country, and is designed to provide integrated training in life, physical, and engineering sciences as preparation for a variety of careers in bioengineering, applied biotechnology, and medicine. Engineering design is woven through each year of our curriculum. Earlier design courses complement the senior design experience and help us train the future leaders and innovators in biomedical engineering. This year's senior design project program was directed by Professors Diane Joseph-McCarthy and Darren Roblyer . This team invested much energy and organizational skills to sustain the level of excellence and impact for which this program is renowned. They were assisted by a very talented team of technical advisors from Boston University, BU Medical and Dental Schools, the Harvard hospitals, and medtech, pharma, and biotech industries. These technical advisors met regularly with their teams to guide the work, and grade and comment on assignments including propos - al drafts, progress reports, and oral presentations. Their efforts helped ensure that the program continues to sustain its high level of distinction. I served as part of this team and was fortunate to enjoy the program in all of its dimen - sions. We were able to increase our enagement with industry partners, including sponsors of the new Bioengineering T echnology & Entrepreneurship Center (BTEC) at BU. Many students utilized the state-of-the-art BTEC facilities to carry out their design and experimentation. Interactions with industry were facilitated with the help of BU's General Counsel, Martin Oppenheimer. I also want to acknowledge the assistance of David Shawn, Adam Kane, and Carroll Beauvais from the BU Writing Program, as well as the six guest lecturers who educated students on topics ranging from professional development to intellectual property to entrepreneurship and regulatory affairs. Finally, a very spe - cial thank you to John Benducci for his sustained support of the Senior Design Program this year. Our students are remarkable at rising to the challenge, and I have no doubt that their presentations today will im - press, inform and entertain you. Enjoy! John A.

The current gold standards of treat - ment for most cognition impairing conditions are prescribed psychostimulants. These medications come with multiple side effects and leave room for misuse leading to addiction and pose other health risks. An alternative non-intrusive, safe, and accessible method of improving cognitive per - formance can contribute to solving this problem. The brain produces electrical activities, known as gamma waves, which are essential for processing and connecting information. Light delivered at 40 flashes per second has been shown to restart the natural 40Hz gamma rhythm of the brain. These gamma waves are associated with memory and cognition, which are affected as a result of cognitive impairments. We ran a study using 40 Hz light stimuli administered through an iPad pro. The participants consisted of a group of college students with conditions affecting their cognition or in a state of fatigue to closely resemble individuals with cognitive disabilities. Subjects were made to take a 10 question arithmetic long addition test with 40 Hz light constantly on or off to de - termine the effect of light on their performance. Our findings showed a jump in performance from the first trial to the second when light was administered. However, this was attributed to the effect of practice and not a consequence of the 40 Hz light. Although, there has been an overall trend of improvement across subjects, the results thus far show no statistical significance in the effect of 40 Hz light on cognition. Development of Behavioral Task to Study Motor Control in Mice Team 20: Antoine Baize, Rachel Munib Hasnain The motor cortex of the brain has been shown to exhibit preparatory, or planning, activity before the execution of a movement. However, much is still unknown about the selective activation of regions of the brain corresponding to motor planning and motor execution. Current motor control studies that observe preparatory signals in the anterolateral motor cortex (ALM) in mice are constrained by a two-directional task paradigm (2AFC) in which a mouse licks one of two lick-sites for a water reward. Implementing a delay period in a 2AFC task allows for the isolation of the preparation and execution activity signals associated with distinct movements. We aimed to expand this paradigm by designing a new task in which mice will be trained to plan three directional movements (right- lick, left-lick, or center-lick) based on unique instructional tones and an enforced delay period. Central to our task was the design of a \"lickport\" to house the three straws that the mouse licks as the motor task. We tested the feasibility of each lickport design by determining whether the mouse could lick each site individually (i.e. they were not too close or too far apart). We also explored the selection and placement of speakers and LEDs as auditory and visual cues within our task. In the future, the mice trained to perform this task will exhibit an increased number of unique directional licking movements in the experiment. This will allow more complex neural activity patterns to be studied and may eventually expose more spatial and temporal correlations between movement preparation and execution signals. 28 BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTS Optimization of Electroencephalography Reference Layer Team 23: Allan Garcia, Stefan L\u00fctschg Technical Advisors: Laura Lewis, Joshua Levitt Simultaneous Electroencephalography & Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, (EEG-fMRI), is a brain imaging technique that combines the high spatial resolution of fMRI with the high temporal resolution of EEG. However, the usage of magnets in fMRI induces electrical currents which are also picked up by the EEG scalp electrodes, this is an effect of Faraday's Law which creates elec - trical noise. Inside the magnetic field the cardiovascular system of the human skull also creates artifacts known as Ballistocardiogram (BCG) noise and this reduces the clarity of EEG data. Re - searchers try to remove these artifacts by designing and producing reference layers which consist of insulating and conductive pieces of fabric that collect BCG noise, allowing for the reduction of artifacts in post-hoc analysis. These Reference Layers tend to be crudely made to fit researchers' specific needs. In the Lewis Lab, we've created a standardized design for a double-sided Refer - ence Cap, consisting of a single fabric that has holes cut out for EEG Scalp Electrodes. This fab - ric has an insulating spandex side that makes contact with the scalp and a nylon fabric side that makes contact with EEG Reference Electrodes. This nylon fabric is coated in poly(3,4-ethylenedi - oxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), an electrically conductive polymer that is safe for usage in MRI machines. With this design, we are able to provide a design that is easy to repli - cate and assemble in any lab. This design functions well as a reference layer, allowing researchers to attenuate noise found during EEG-fMRI imaging. BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTS 29 30 BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTS Computer Automated Neuron Identification in Functional Microscopy for C. elegans Team 34: Jun Young Choi, Laura Mazuera Technical Advisors: Andrew Chang (BU School of Medicine), Christopher Connor (BWH & BU School of Medicine), Christopher Gabel (BU School of Medicine) Current neuroimaging techniques are capable of capturing real-time neuronal activities, indicating areas of neuronal stimulation. However, state-of-art microscopes have compromised resolution, capturing the average neuronal activities of thousands of neurons in a single voxel. Due to this resolution limitation, the activities and interactions between individual neurons can only be inferred. To overcome the limitation, we have chosen hermaphrodite C. elegans with GCaMP and Neu our specimen. Hermaphrodite C. elegans' neuronal system consists of stereo - typed 302 neurons. The GCaMP transgene allows for fluorescence in response to calcium levels, which serves as a proxy of neuronal activity. Calcium levels alone are insufficient to map individual neuronal activity because each neuron is susceptible to positional changes. To accurately locate individual neurons, neuroPAL transgene is implemented. NeuroPAL transgene is designed to char - acterize neurons with a unique fluorescence color, providing a means to differentiate neurons by its fluorescence coupled with approximate location. To accurately capture the positional and flu - orescence data, images are acquired with Dual Inverted Selective Plane Illumination Microscope (DiSPIM). DiSPIM microscope has isotropic resolution, compared to the conventional confocal mi - croscope which has compromised z-direction resolution. The acquired images are then processed with an automatic neuron labeling algorithm that labels each neuron with the be both position and color. Altogether, this algorithm allows tracing neuronal activity of individual neurons in real-time, which can be utilized to examine the effect of various stimuli on neuronal activity and interactions in a single neuron resolution.

White, Daniel Carbonero, Jad Noueihed Anesthetics are widely used in modern medicine to induce loss of consciousness and henceforth allow painless performance of medical procedures that would be otherwise unbearable. Therefore, anesthetics have proven useful for surgeries and invasive clinical procedures in all populations. Because anesthetic response is not uniform across patients, it's crucial to have an objective mea - sure of depth, other than behavioral response Empirical measurements of anesthetic depth are difficult to take and are sometimes unavailable altogether. Hence, we propose a machine learning classifier to discern the level of anesthesia in mice using local field potential (LFP) and two-pho - ton calcium imaging recordings. The voltage recordings are automatically preprocessed to extract burst suppression activity, as well as filter and identify artifacts. Recurrence rate and burst sup - pression rate are features chosen to characterize the nonlinear nature of burst suppression events which occur only in the anesthetized state. When a subject is anesthetized, neuronal signals shift in power from high to low frequencies, which is quantified as a feature by spectral edge frequency. These features were used in two classification models: random forest and support vector machine. The former is robust, flexible and offers greater accuracy due to its collection of prediction trees, while the latter is versatile and matches with the brain because the brain is highly nonlinear. We cross validate both models, to demonstrate both classification models are effective at predicting the depth of anesthesia in mice. 34 BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTSA Cloud-Based Framework for Organizing and Analyzing fNIRS Datasets Team 3: Christian Arthur, Jeonghoon Choi, Jiazhen Liu, Juncheng Zhang Technical Advisors: David Boas, Stephen Tucker Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a fast, safe and non-invasive neuroimaging tech - nique that uses interaction between light and matter to study the brain and neural activity. Currently, fNIRS researchers use various available databases to store and share the data. In this project, we propose a cloud-based user interface that helps users in organizing their data and sharing methods in a standardized format. This framework utilizes a proposed fNIRS-BIDS data structure based on the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). This project includes the design and development of a front-end user interface along with the back-end Python packages for handling shared near infra - red spectroscopy format (SNIRF) file and fNIRS-BIDS folders to be used in the cloud-based frame - work. A mock-up is developed with Figma to illustrate the functionalities and the accessibility of the user interface. The mock-up and the package is passed to BU Software & Application Innovation Lab for prototyping. The Python packages were thoroughly reviewed and currently maintained by the software engineers in the BU Neurophotonics Center. This development process provides grounds for implementing the standardized folder structure and processing pipelines that direct users in organizing their fNIRS datasets. Furthermore, this provides the foundation for implemen - tation such as incorporating data quality metrics for immediate data feedback for the users. The long-term goal is to establish a standard platform that facilitates data sharing and quality assurance for fNIRS users.

Ultrasound stimulation is unique in its ability to pass through the cranium and deep tissue noninvasively, showing promise in clinical applications as a therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. Despite studies implicating mitochondria in the neu - ral response to ultrasound, the role of mitochondrial activity in ultrasound neuromodulation have not been fully explored. Therefore, there is a critical need to determine the bioenergetic effects and biophysical mechanisms of ultrasound on neuronal mitochondria. The implication of a mitochondri - al transduction pathway in ultrasound neuromodulation would broaden understanding of both the neuron's response to mechanical stimulation and neural activity energetics, further enabling its use as an investigative tool and expansion of its clinical potential. First, an in vitro confocal imaging pro - tocol was developed to quantify bioenergetic activity using the mitochondrial inner membrane-tar - geted voltage dye TMRM. A specimen setup was designed to enable simultaneous imaging and ultrasound stimulation. Then, the dynamics of the voltage gradient driving ATP production under spontaneous and pulsed ultrasound conditions were compared to assess the effects of stimulation. Finally, the biophysical interaction between ultrasound and the mitochondrial membrane was mod - eled in silico via molecular dynamics simulations, and membrane voltage changes were derived from the simulated deformations to be validated against empirical data. These results evaluate an alternate pathway for ultrasound transduction via the mitochondria and the possibility for bioener - getic uses of ultrasound stimulation. 36 BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTSNinjaNIRS 2022 Backpack System Team 8: Robert Bing, Benjamin Lissner, Juan Luis Ugarte Nunez Technical Advisors: David Boas, Walker J. O'Brien, Bernhard Zimmermann Brain monitoring devices like fNIRS and EEG offer valid approaches to monitor the cognitive states and activity of the brain. Moreover, it's been found that utilizing fNIRS and EEG in tandem creates a hybrid fiber system that attains greater success than each individually. However, use of this im - proved method has been limited by its lack of portability and inability of long-term continuous mon - itoring of brain activity during movement, perception, and social interaction in real time while in the real world. Therefore, we propose a multimodal portable brain monitoring system that incorporates fNIRS, EEG, and an Eye Tracking System into a lightweight backpack that can capture the data in real time. The case to house the fNIRS system was designed using the CAD software, SolidWorks. The purpose-built casing was created to accommodate a greater array of optodes and updates on the custom NinjaNIRS system. The backpack was designed such that it safely houses each system and is ergonomic towards the user. An interior composed such that it will secure systems from damage, while maintaining accessibility to components for easy troubleshooting and data col - lection. Upon finalization of the realized hybrid backpack system, it's within expectations that we'll have found and designed a prototype that best exemplifies desired traits for long duration real time clinical brain recordings. The device will open up a whole new field of experimentation and testing from which valuable data can be collected and analyzed.

The primary goal of this project was to create an electrocardiogram (ECG) measurement device that is connected to a compatible software ap - plication, which can output data sufficiently accurate to be used for patient-administered medical monitoring in a remote setting. A 3-Lead ECG device was developed using an ESP32 microcon - troller and an AD8232 module, which is an integrated signal conditioning block for ECG. In order to confirm the reliability of the device's collected signal, we compared it to verified ECG signals from the Physionet ECG database. An Arduino program was uploaded to the ESP32 that initializes data transmission. The ECG device communicates with the software application wirelessly by sending data through Amazon Web Services (AWS), a cloud-based computing service that can securely analyze, organize, and direct data to its final destination. In AWS, lambda functions were created based on previously researched Signal Quality Indices (SQIs) to categorize the signal as Excellent, Barely Acceptable, and Unacceptable. Depending on the signal's categorization, the smartphone application relays to the patient whether the ECG device needs to be adjusted and the signal rec - ollected. ReactNative was utilized as the framework for the mobile application. Distinction of our approach and device design from competing devices on the market lie in our novel IoT cloud com - puting methods, real-time feedback to the patient about signal quality, and patient data encryption methods. 40 BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTSMultispectral 2D Imaging for Oxygen Saturation in Tumor Detection Team 22: Chengxi Fan, Yining Guo, Ziwen Xie Technical Advisors: Ousama A'amar, Irving Bigio Tumors exhibit greater vascularization and lower blood oxygenation. Suspicious tumors may be detected by measuring the changes in oxygen saturation (SO2), noninvasively. In this project, we explore a method to perform 2D SO2 mapping of superficial human tissue. Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin exhibit distinctive reflection patterns of light in response to both red and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. Using a multispectral imaging technique, SO2 mapping of a region of interest (ROI) can be performed. Light from red and NIR LEDs is sequentially projected on tissue while short videos are automatically recorded. Frames are then isolated and processed at each illumination wavelength. LEDs are placed at a specific angle relative to the surface of the tissue so that the camera only captures reflected light that interacts with the targeted tissue. The frames are then analyzed with an algorithm that was designed to extract and process the light intensities frame by frame. Each frame is split into 10X10 pixels areas. The average intensity of each area is collected over time. Matching pixel coordinates are then used to produce SO2 maps. Both the device and the algorithm are validated by liquid phantoms that mimic the optical properties of oxygenated and deoxygenated tissues. Consequently, our product, utilizing 2D SO2 imaging technology, is capable of producing high-resolution images of SO2 mapping from targeted tissues based on the difference in vascularization.

Currently, most practices of bioluminescence imaging are performed on small mammals such as mice, although recent studies have shown that murine models do not accurately trans - late into human disease expression genes. Research shows Drosophila Melanogaster, otherwise known as the fruit fly, may be a better model for studying bacterial disease progression due to sharing approximately 75% of the disease expression genes humans have. Until recently, all tools used to characterize the infection in fruit fly models were destructive to either measure the bacterial pathogen load or host response. The Wunderlich Lab at Boston University is conducting research that combines bioluminescence disease tracking and the use of the fruit fly model to mitigate these limitations. A compact, cost effective, and robust bioluminescence imaging device will be proto - typed. Through an iterative design process, the device will be capable of capturing raw data from bioluminescent injected fruit flies, process the data to determine pathogenic load in all fruit flies, and output a legible plot for visual aid. To correctly process the data, a team-scripted MATLAB code will be used for image processing to convert the number of photons to pathogenic load. Through longitudinal monitoring of induced diseases, research may uncover important turning points in disease development. Furthermore, this prototype is intended to make this research more feasible and accessible. 96-Well Plate Fruit Fly Configuration Prototyped Bioluminesense Imaging Device Image Processing So/f_twareGraphical Output of Logitudinal Pathogen Development42 BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTSImproving the Sensitivity and Automating the Basilar Membrane Probe Team 41: Andrew Gross, Jose Miguel Sevilla, Jasper Zeng Technical Advisor: Aleks Zosuls Marine mammals rely on their hearing for spatial awareness, catching prey, and communicating. Interference from naval sonar disrupts their abilities to survive such as causing their eardrums to rupture which can result in them being stranded. The cochlea is a part of the inner ear which aids with hearing. Within it is the basilar membrane, a spiral shaped membrane which contains sensory receptors responsible for hearing. The stiffness of the membrane is what determines what frequen - cies it is sensitive to. To better understand this we have built a probe to measure the stiffness of the basilar membrane based on the design of a similar probe by Brian S. Miller et al. The main changes we have made to this design is to make the loading mechanism less stiff as well as automate it to increase the sensitivity of the probe and to optimize gathering of measurements. To determine the probe's performance, measurements were taken using the old probe and our improved probe on AFM beams of known stiffness to determine the accuracy of the probe. Measurements were also taken on gerbil membranes with both probes to determine the amount of time to take measure - ments. We believe a successful automated basilar probe will allow for a better understanding of what frequencies animals are sensitive to. BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTS 43 NEPHRO: Novel Evaluative Probe for Pilvar, Lina Lin Wei Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 20 million Americans and is commonly treated with hemodialysis (HD), a treatment that replaces kidney function by removing excess fluid from the body. There is a need for a method to assess fluid volume in HD patients to ensure that fluid overload or depletion does not occur. Our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of NEPHRO, a novel wearable short-wave infrared (SWIR) probe with an integrated pressure sensor, to quantify water and lipid composition in tissue in a non-invasive, direct, and computable way. Developments in SWIR technology enable a quantitative and non-intrusive way to image tissue with higher trans - parency and resolution than near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRs) imaging. The probe has LEDs of 980, 1200, and 1300 nm and source-detector separations (SDSs) of 7, 10, 13, and 16 mm. Light from the LEDs penetrate tissue and the photodiode measures the absorbance of the reflected light, which is then converted to an electrical current with a measurable voltage. The microcontroller connected to the photodiode stores the voltage measurements taken. We are investigating the relationship between the voltage signal and the concentration of water and lipid in a sample using tissue-mimicking phantoms and in vitro trials to determine the amount of excess fluid carried by a patient. Our integrated pressure sensor has allowed us to ensure that NEPHRO is making suf - ficient contact with the tissue. We hope that our device will be able to provide a personalized and precise measurement to improve patient care for HD patients. BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTS 45 Biomechanics Track 1 Session DBME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTS 47 Novel Method for Strain Transfer Research on Murine Flexor Tendons at Cellular Level Team 26: Gabriela Chiu Victor Wong Technical Advisor: Brianne Connizzo Tendinopathy is a highly prevalent clinical condition mainly caused by overuse or age-related de - generation of tissues. The transfer of strain from the ECM to the cell triggers extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Therefore, a reduction in strain transfer could lead to a reduction in ECM re - modeling and ultimately, tissue degeneration. A bioreactor with the capabilities of applying con - trolled loads and imaging loaded tissues would enable the study of strain transfer at the cellular level. The team inherited previously established hardware for a customized mechanical loading bioreactor, which has the potential to be used in conjunction with the Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope. The team developed two custom programs using MATLAB App Designer to control the bioreactor and analyze data. The control software performs customized experiments (Manual Movement, Imaging Protocol, and Cyclic Movement), provides real-time data of relative position of the slider and applied load on the sample, and saves data to an Excel file for further analysis. The data analysis software uses image processing and tissue-level displacement data to calculate multi-scale strains and strain transfers. Depending on the structure(s) stained in the confocal imag - es, the software has the ability to calculate ECM-, cell-, and nucleus-level strains as well as strain transfers from tissue to ECM, ECM to cell, and cell to nucleus. Additionally, the team developed a research protocol for a future age-related experiment, which would allow Dr. Connizzo to observe strain transfer via simultaneous mechanical loading and fluorescence imaging on bioreactor and collect time-dependent load & displacement dataFIJI software processes images from microscope Bioreactor data & confocal images used to calculate multi-scale strains & strain transfers Calculated data saved to MS Excel /f_ileResearch reported in this publication was supported by the Boston University Micro and Nano Imaging Facility and the Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health of the National Institutes of Health under award Number S10OD024993.

Medicine has advanced so much that people take for granted how intricate recovery is. The healing process at the cellular level is com - plex and involves a cascade of reactions that occur over the course of recovery. This complexity makes it difficult to simulate the bone fracture's progression as it heals. A successful simulation model would allow care providers to accurately track healing outcomes for their patients and catch any deviations in a timely manner. The issue is that the current framework for bone healing mod - els is incomplete because these models fail to account for all four stages of healing (inflammatory phase, soft callus formation, hard callus formation and bone remodeling). In particular, the inflam - matory stage is the most neglected stage in these models and so our team, using data collected from healthy rats , focused on this issue by constructing a computational model that simulates healing from the earliest stages of healing to bone reformation. The team created a biological ex - pression map incorporating new RNA data to model the different growth factors that are present at the fracture site during recovery. We also updated an existing mechanical model that describes the optimal conditions of a bone fracture during recovery. It is the combination of these two models that are used to construct the new mechanobiological computational model that will simulate bone healing. This model will hopefully set a foundation for bone healing models that can be easily im - plemented in healthcare in the future. BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTS 49 Rotator Cuff Tendon Surface Strain during Glenohumeral Motion: A Cadaveric Model to Assess the Effects of Mechanical Load and Joint Position Team 31: Andrew Miao, Zhongkun Xue Technical Advisors: Ara Nazarian (BIDMC & Harvard Medical School), Patrick Williamson (BIDMC & MechE) The rotator cuff muscles stabilize the glenohumeral joint which consists of the humeral head and the glenoid. This ball-and-socket joint enables the shoulder to have a wide range of motion. There are four muscles that create the rotator cuff (RC): Subscapularis, Infraspinatus, Supraspinatus, and Teres Minor. Each of these RC muscles serves a unique role in movements such as adduction and rotation. Injuries such as shoulder impact or jerking movements of the shoulder are common incidents that cause a rotator cuff tear (RCT). RCTs can be a partial or full tear and symptomatic or asymptomatic. Patients are more likely to seek treatment if they have a symptomatic tear because of pain or difficulties with typical movements. Nearly two-thirds of all RCTs are asymptomatic and can be left untreated. Given that RCTs are difficult to identify and their tear progression, this cre - ates a critical need to identify the surface strain of RC tendons from mechanical loading and joint position so that RCTs can be treated before muscle and tendon atrophy occurs. Here we propose a cadaveric study to analyze the surface strain of the supraspinatus tendon during passive adduc - tion using an existing glenohumeral testing system and a 2D image correlation. Furthermore, we propose to apply this system to investigate the effect of RC load and joint position on tendon strain. The objective of this project is to better understand how the position of the glenohumeral joint and loading on the RC tendons affect the surface strain of the tendons. 50 BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTSA System for Imaging Precision Cut Lung Slices Team 33: Precision Cut Lung Slices (PCLS) are a reliable tool to model the biomechanical activity of lung tissue. Its numerous advantages include the retaining of nearly all resident cell types in the lung, preserving the native extracellular environment, and suitability for high resolution imaging. Re - cent developments of novel tissue stretchers which mimic physiological breathing patterns allow researchers to track lung pathology progression via the changing mechanical properties of the lung tissue. Tracking tissue deformation, however, is difficult due to the lack of high contrast areas within the tissue, which image processing software require for their correlation algorithms. Current solutions are constrained by a small field of view, or are limited to the imaging of a single sample. We propose the use of ink-filled beads to provide the contrast necessary for mapping areas of the tissue during stretch, and housing the camera below the sample in the indenter to avoid light scattering caused by imaging through the tissue. This technique is known as Absorption Contrast, enabling tracking of deformations via the movement of beads at resting state and stretching state. Methods used in previous studies have been employed to ensure bead homogeneity and proper binding to the tissue. The beads are illuminated through the tissue using six dimmable, white LEDs and two layers of a light diffuser to ensure even lighting. An endoscope is housed within the indent - er in order to image the tissue from below, allowing us to image a large field of view of 12 samples simultaneously.

Amongst the middle ear bones of aquatic cetaceans there is an anatomical anomaly where differ - ent regions of the bone vary in density. Through the use of a precision saw and resin to create ef - fective whale middle ear bone samples and a microscope camera, precise mapping of the density of the samples can begin. Recent studies have shown by using Electric Scattering Spectroscopy (ESS), one can utilize the scattering of photons at different wavelengths for the incus, malleus, and stapes of two different species of whales and relate them to the number density can be used to de - tail different regions of bones for multiple species. In comparison, the water displacement method could measure the mass density of the material, but not specific areas while the Basilar Membrane Probe could measure the density of the material, but fails at high hearing frequencies. In this ex - periment, we explore a new way to quantify and understand the density of aquatic cetacean middle ear bones and expand on making it precise by building a fixture to hold the ESS probe. The number density can be achieved through the reduced scattering coefficient found using ESS and then one can find the scattering coefficient and subsequently the number density for regions of the middle ear bone. We demonstrate that using ESS is a much better tool to quantify the density because of its accuracy and precision than other methods. BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTS 53 Nanoscience & Synthetic Biology Track 2 Session ABME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTS 55 Miniaturized Microfluidic Device for High Throughput Production of Lipid Nanoparticles Team 25: Shirin Bakre, Genevieve Dowd, Liam Densmore (BU ECE), Radhakrishna Sanka (ECE) Microfluidic devices are ideal for developing and manufacturing lipid nanoparticles for drug delivery because they allow the production of micro-scale products with limited waste. The primary restric - tion with these devices, however, is their output potential; microfluidic devices are often limited to production of small volumes of product. In order to counter these constraints, toroidal micromixer (TrM) and staggered herringbone micromixer (SHM) designs are investigated. To resolve which of the mixing methods is most efficient at high flow rates, mixing index (MI) is measured across colored water pushed through the mixers. After determining that the TrM is a suboptimal mixing mechanism in comparison to the traditional SHM, we have developed computational designs for the SHM in order to create this component through soft lithography. Using a chrome mask and cus - tom manifold to produce an insert, this PDMS-based mixer was then inserted into a polycarbonate device containing a multiplexer and parallelization ladder. Multiplexion allows for the selection of inputs internally, enabling expedient switching between various inputs. The use of a parallelization ladder enables greater throughput by dividing the inputs between multiple mixers. As the mixer requires a comparatively low volume to function, mixing serves as a bottleneck. Parallelization via a ladder system allows individual mixers to receive appropriate volumes while a greater volume is processed by the device as a whole. 56 BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTSNovel Nanoemulsions for Intra-ocular Delivery of Team 24: Matthew Reynolds-Tejeda, Cedric Salame Technical Advisors: Leo Kim (Massachusetts Eye and Ear - Harvard Ophthalmology), Magali Saint-Geniez (Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research) Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the major cause of irreversible vision loss in elderly populations and is characterized by the progressive degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium, the primary support of the photoreceptors. Currently there is no treatment for the early stage of the pathology, dry AMD, and there is sub-optimal treatment for the advanced stage, wet AMD. Previous work in the lab has identified a compound, ZLN005, as a potent antioxidant able to normalize mitochondrial activity to rescue retinal pigment epithelial degeneration and/or block choroidal neovascularization. However, the application of the compound in-vitro and in-vivo has been hindered by its low solubility in aqueous environments. Nanoemulsions (NEM), which are composed of an oil core and an emulsifier shell, have been shown to improve the biodistribution of such drugs; therefore, we propose the encapsulation of ZLN005 within a NEM. The NEMs are formed using a probe tip sonicator and then characterized by dynamic light scattering, which in - forms on size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential. We have optimized the composition of the NEMs and encapsulated ZLN005 in our best formulations. We then treated human retinal pigment epithelial cells with drug-loaded NEMs in-vitro to correctly quantify the therapeutic effect of ZLN005 when delivered by the nanocarriers. Furthermore, it becomes possible to treat AMD through a top - ical application of 57 Novel Design of Polymeric Nanoparticles for Targeted Drug Delivery to Glial Cells Team Ramos Espinoza Technical Advisor: Timothy O'Shea As the population ages, central nervous system (CNS) disorders have become more prevalent, yet the challenges associated with treating them persist. Glial cells, which maintain a healthy CNS, are an important target for drug therapy. To address glial dysfunction, our team designed polymeric nanoparticles to preferentially target microglia and deliver small-molecule drugs. We developed an in silico pipeline to identify uniquely-expressed glial surface transporters. This pipeline mined published datasets with expression reads for glial cell transporter genes and computed z-scores to normalize the expressions across datasets. Using data dimensionality reduction, we identified uniquely and highly expressed genes for glial cell types. From this analysis, we selected a mi - croglial gene, SLC2A5, which is the only fructose transporter in the CNS. We designed a polymer that includes a fructose ligand to permit preferential binding to this transporter. To enable polymer functionalization, we acrylated fructose by an enzymatic reaction, purified it by flash chromatog - raphy, and confirmed purity by NMR. Branched polymers were synthesized via Michael Addition polymerization using different multifunctional thiol and acrylate oligomers before end-capping with fructose monoacrylate. Comparisons of polymer composition were evaluated by FTIR. These poly - mers were nanoprecipitated to generate nanoparticles (NPs). Stability and size of NPs were char - acterized using DLS. Formulations with optimized fructose percentage, stable ~100 nm size were pursued further. Polymers applied to neural cell cultures were non-toxic. Additional cell uptake as - says are scheduled to determine microglial cell selectivity and specificity. Nanoparticles designed to interact with a specific cell transporter show promise to target cells for therapy .

We designed a genetic circuit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that utilizes molecular assembly kinetics to perform \"input coherence detection\". These circuits can detect when two distinct input signals are present simultaneously, allowing for greater specificity and fine-tuned output control to make a synthetic circuit more akin to natural biological circuits. Our system leverages oligomerizing protein-protein pairs that can form both homodimers and heterodimers. Each oligomerizing domain is fused to half of a synthetic transcription factor and controlled by a distinct chemical input. In the simultaneous presence of both hormones, co-expres - sion of both protein domains drives formation of heterodimers to activate circuit output. Staggered induction will alternatively drive production of homodimeric complexes that delay circuit activation. Through a series of experiments, we measured fluorescent output in response to varied temporal input sequences via flow cytometry. We then developed a computational model of the circuit based on protein-protein assembly kinetics, from which we derived characteristic circuit parameters, such as induction and decay time constants. Further work includes identifying topological improvements to the circuit architecture to adjust for unwanted couplings that may influence its behavior. By mod - eling our synthetic circuit under physiologically relevant conditions, we have expanded our toolbox of protein-protein pairs for future applications in vivo. Our work could contribute to downstream therapeutics, such as CAR T-cell therapy or biosensors to recognize pathogens in the body.

The device will be used to perform mass screening of individuals and provide a metric for additional testing and diagnosis from a licensed medical professional. It will return a semi-quanti - tative value based on low, slightly elevated, or high creatinine values using the results from a Jaffe reaction - a more affordable alternative to enzymatic reactions. The main component of our device is a small light proof cuvette holder and a cuvette with a lid to contain the blood sample (obtained from a finger-prick). The lid will hold a plasma separation membrane and a capillary tube to drain the serum. The blood will then mix with the reagent found in the cuvette and the reaction will oc - cur. The reaction will run for five minutes and then the voltage drop will be recorded across the phototransistor at an absorption value of 500 nm. The patient will be categorized into a risk group based on the corresponding voltage reading, where higher readings indicate higher creatinine lev - els. The device will display this reading on a built-in LED screen. To achieve this functionality, 3-D printed components, simple spectrophotometer-like measurements, and a microprocessor (such as an Arduino) will be used to create the POC diagnostic device at an affordable price range. 62 BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTSAssessing Interstitial Fibrosis and Tubular Atrophy (IFTA) Using Minimally-Invasive Elastic Scattering Spectroscopy as an Indicator of Kidney Health Team 6: Giulia Boccardo, Ji Young Chung, Ousama A'amar, Irving Bigio Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a serious illness characterized by diminished kidney function that affects about 1 in 7 US adults. It consistently results in required dialysis and eventually kid - ney transplant(s). Currently, assessing the health of kidneys for transplant involves reviewing the deceased's medical record history and physically examining the organ ex vivo. The current gold standard of CKD diagnosis involves measuring the extent of IFTA through a kidney biopsy, a risky procedure involving a large needle with many drawbacks. Therefore, there is a pressing clinical need for a method to rapidly measure and assess IFTA for both the allocation of transplant kidneys and treatment of CKD without the guesswork or tissue damage. Our team has designed, built, and tested a minimally invasive fiber optic probe to measure the viability of kidney function. Our probe incorporates elastic-scattering spectroscopy (ESS) which measures backscattered light over the 300-900 nm range. We have tested our device on unlabeled tissue of an adenine rat model of CKD and were able to find correlation between disease progression and changes in the measured ESS spectra. The results were observed spectral trends of decreased slope of scattering intensity in the near-UV to short-visible region (300-500 nm), relative to longer wavelengths, for fibrotic kidneys compared to normal kidneys. The results of this study will demonstrate the potential of ESS tech - nology as a more accurate, rapid, and non-invasive assessment of IFTA for potential donor kidneys and its application for in vivo procedures. BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTS 63 Effect of Digital Intervention on Social and Verbal Skills in Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder Team 9: Matthew Collins, Nathaniel Heitmann-Basoni, James Maher, Technical Advisor: Andrey Vyshedskiy (ImagiRation, LLC; BU MET) Verbal communication is arguably the most common and effective method of communication be - tween people. Children with cognitive impairments and learning disabilities, however, often face challenges with regards to the expression and understanding of ideas in a verbal form. Difficulty with such communication can have a very harmful effect on a person's ability to be independent and fully integrated into society. As such, studies have been conducted on a variety of methods to help these children develop crucial conversation skills, such as understanding social cues and continuing a conversation. Direct intervention and one-on-one speech therapy have been widely proven to be the most impactful methods. Unfortunately, such methods are costly and potentially difficult to implement at a large scale, and many speech therapists face difficulty when trying to distinguish between providing feedback and participating in conversation, an issue which is exac - erbated by echolalia. This project aims to improve upon this method of therapy by developing a smart device-compatible application which will assume the role of conversation partner, leaving the clinician to provide feedback. The application utilizes a cloud storage system to pull videos of actors which correspond to conversation topics or particular questions, and it provides methods by which clinicians may give feedback to the patient. Ultimately, this project aims to understand the effects, if any, of replacing human conversation partners with an application on the effectiveness of one-on-one speech therapy for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). 64 BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTSDigital Biopsy for Glomerular Ultrastructural Connor Kim, Aksel Laudon, Grace Qian, Zhaoze Wang (ECE), Jackson Ye INTERDISCIPLINARY Technical Advisors: Weining Lu (BU School of Medicine), Vijaya Kolachalama (BU School of Medicine), Joel M. Henderson (BU School of Medicine) The glomerular filtration barrier is vital to normal kidney function. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images visualize its cross-sectional ultrastructure, which consists of the sieve-like glomeru - lar basement membrane (GBM) and podocyte foot processes. Proteinuric kidney diseases (PKD) are associated with filtration barrier morphological changes, which are observed experimentally and clinically in terms of GBM width and foot process width (FPW) measurements. Current TEM image measurement is performed manually as no fully automated solution exists. This limits re - search into PKD mechanisms and therapeutics with its labor intensiveness and operator bias. We developed an automated tool to measure input TEM images from a dataset of wild type (WT, n=5) and PKD model (ILK cKO, n=5) mice. A U-Net semantic segmentation model was trained on the dataset and corresponding manually annotated GBM masks. First, the segmentation model iden - tifies GBM in input images. Next, these GBM segmentations enter an image processing algorithm that estimates GBM width and FPW. In our validation study on the dataset, resulting segmentation accuracy was strong relative to existing literature. The estimated mean GBM width and FPW mea - surements closely matched manual measurements for WT but differed significantly for ILK cKO animals. Measured GBM width and FPW were significantly wider for ILK cKO than WT mice, which aligns with known morphology. These results suggest our tool performs comparably to manual measurement on healthy tissue and can distinguish healthy from pathological samples. Our tool provides high-throughput, objective morphological analysis for research, and in the future could potentially facilitate clinical PKD diagnosis.

Chakravarty (Fractal Tx) SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, had led to an ongoing health emergency across the globe, claiming the lives of millions and impacting billions of others to a profound extent. Despite the increasing availability of vaccines, the virus continues to spread and mutate into new variants. Because most vaccines tend to target the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there exists the threat of viral escape by evolution from vaccine effectiveness. As such, there is an urgent need for antiviral treatments that target a different mechanism of viral entry to increase the evolutionary se - lection pressure placed on the virus, potentially extending the duration of effectiveness of vaccines across viral variants and directly reducing viral transmission and infection. The protein GRP78 pro - vides one possible novel target for antiviral treatments. GRP78 is known to act as a host auxiliary factor for the binding of [JDM1] the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein to the human cellular ACE2, the primary pathway of cell infection. Here, we first modeled the binding of GRP78 to the spike protein ACE2 structure. We then used that model of the GRP78-Spike-ACE2 complex to propose a set of molecules determined through structure-based virtual screening of known drug databases that can be computationally demonstrated to disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein from binding to the GRP78 substrate binding domain (SBD), effectively preventing viral entry to the cell. A subset of the lead compounds has been selected to be suitable for intranasal administration to prevent viral propagation beyond the nasal mucosa, offering the potential for an early exposure intranasal treatment for COVID-19 following further clinical development.

Campbell (Broad Institute), Sumaiya Iqbal (Broad Institute) Inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3 are implicated in the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease, Fragile X syndrome, and bipolar disorder symptoms. However, most known GSK3 inhibitors are non-specific, affect both paralogs, and as a result, incur undesirable side effects. Hence, machine learning classification of GSK3 inhibitors into alpha-specific and beta-specific binding categories is fundamental in narrowing down compounds for more precise drug development, which in turn can guide the way towards improved patient outcomes. As in any machine learning problem, the first step of this project was to gather a large dataset (labeled, in this case, for supervised training) and to filter out duplicate and unlabeled data points. Additional preprocessing included feature selection and generation of Morgan fingerprints from SMILES keys. Our machine learning model consisted of multiple different classifiers. Integration of multiple algorithms to increase predictive power is common practice for many applications in the machine learning world, such as natural language processing and image analysis. Studies have shown that multi-layered models can decrease vari - ance, avoid overfitting, and improve classification accuracy of ligands as drug-like and non-drug like. In this project, we integrate random forest, SVM, and MLP algorithms to predict the ligand activity of chemical inputs to GSK3 and GSK3 separately.

Smith Homeostasis is a core concept in understanding body behaviour in biology and physiology; it refers to the self-regulating process by which an organism can maintain internal stability while adjusting to changing external conditions. Though, there is a lack of research on homeostasis on a smaller scale, where this project will explore tensional homeostasis at the focal adhesion (FA) points of the cell on the subcellular level. When a cell reaches a homeostatic state, the morphology of the cell will fluctuate to external stimulus. Specifically, this research will analyze how the displacement and fluctuation at the FA level will affect tensional homeostasis when the mechanical force is applied to the cell. FA are dense molecular assemblies and actin stress fibres connect together. This com - putation modelling is proposed to simulate cellular fluctuations that mimic in vivo laboratory cell fluctuations when the cell is responding to a stimulus such as traction force. This study introduces the Monte Carlo algorithm into the simulation process, so as to maximize the use of mathematical models to analyze the relationship between various transformations in the tensional homeostasis process to reduce physical laboratory experiments. As shown in Graph 1, the horizontal axis rep - resents the full duration of an in vivo experiment and the vertical axis represents random traction forces generated by the Monte-Carlo function. The different coloured lines represent one simula - tion of cellular fluctuation. These data can be used to predict the threshold when the cell reaches the homeostatic balance. Our long term goal is for these data to be used in further research to perform analysis on cellular behaviours relating to reaching the success of homeostasis and hence be a critical need in preventing diseases caused by the disruption of homeostasis such as cancer and artherocolosis.

The Rosebud healthcare system faces limited resources, 20% hospital understaffing, and long-standing histor - ical trauma. Furthermore, their Indian Health Services (IHS) hospital was shut down in 2015 for failure to meet the Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services' criteria for standards of care, and the surgery and obstetric units have remained closed. There is currently no systematic method to evaluate successful interventions for funding and training to mediate these issues and initiate actionable change within the Rosebud healthcare system. We propose a novel data-driven and community-based computational model analyzing resource-dependent outcomes in the Rosebud IHS. The purpose of this model is to simulate the average patient population during one year to test different potential interventions to systematically analyze how patient trust and access to care may be improved through targeted interventions. Application of the model to specific patient and staffing barriers indicates, through quantitative results, that the number of appointments available at the outpatient ward, access to family-care, transportation, and historical trauma are key areas that impact patient access. These quantitative predictions are consistent with the recommenda - tions presented in the Community Health Profiles, such as the increased support for transportation and expanded medical services. This model will lay the groundwork for the utilization of similar computational models in other marginalized communities seeking to analyze and improve patient access and trust.BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTS 71 Designing Novel Disruptors of SARS-CoV-2 Viral Spike Protein Function by Targeting the Nucleotide Binding Site of Chaperone Protein GRP78 Team Tx) GRP78, a host auxiliary factor for many viruses, is a promising target for antiviral treatment of SARS-CoV-2 because of its role in forming a complex with ACE2 and the viral spike protein. Fur - ther studies have also shown that disrupting GRP78 function in vitro down-regulate ACE2 expres - sion, leading to reduced viral cell entry. It is believed that binding to nucleotide binding domain (NBD) is responsible for disrupting GRP78 function, and compounds that capable of disrupting GRP78 function will serve as promising leads for the discovery of potential early-treatment options for SARS-CoV-2. After literature review completion and confirmation of GRP78 binding sites, we were able to choose appropriate databases in preparation to compute our own virtual screens. By comparing the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) residues used in different academic articles and available drugs repurposed to target the NBD of GRP78, we have determined the binding sites and residues. After a careful review of ZINC15 database, we decided to use the NIH, International Drug Collection, and ChEMBL as the final databases for docking to avoid those databases that have already been screened by other research groups. We first docked ATP to the NBD of 5E84 (ATP- bound state of GRP78) Chain A after we removed its original ligand ATP, as a control to make sure the docking site is specified correctly. Then, we have performed our own virtual screens by utilizing the software Glide to calculate docking-scoring grids for binding sites and conduct ligand docking. After docking, the most promising ligands were selected based on the information gathered from both previous literature and our own virtual screens. The top molecules have been determined based on their binding affinity compared to the control ligand ATP, as well as other ADME proper - ties that are available for any in vivo or in vitro studies about their toxicity to human body. By using QikProp Software, we have determined the most promising ligands that have the highest binding affinity to GRP78 and the best ADME properties for orally and potentially intranasally delivered drugs. By discovering ligands that can successfully reduce the rate of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor, this project will vastly advance the development of antiviral treatments and slow the escape evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein.

However, prior to their use in clinical applications, extensive testing is required to evaluate their material properties and the forces that they can sustain. An important adhesive characteristic to consider is its burst pressure, defined as the pressure at which an adhesive applied over a hole or laceration fails. Burst pressure testing is a standard method used to evaluate the mechanical stresses that adhesives can withstand, and various laboratory bench tests have been individually developed across research and industry for evaluating this parameter in vitro. The aim of our project was to utilize aspects of prior burst pres - sure bench tests to design a custom testing apparatus optimized to both measure burst pressure and visualize leakage for the purpose of supporting Draper R&D efforts. To construct this system, a review of other burst testing systems was conducted to reveal necessary system components. Conceptual design iterations were then created, incorporating the components of prior designs that best fit the aims of our system. These conceptual designs were reviewed until one was selected to be physically prototyped and tested to validate the capabilities of the system. By allowing for both measurement and visualization of surgical adhesives, our design enables rapid and accurate testing of surgical adhesives to aid in the continuing development of novel surgical adhesives. Moreover, it can provide further precedent for the development of future burst pressure tests that can better yield insight into the qualities of surgical adhesives.

Due to the limitations and ethical concerns of testing drugs in pregnant women as well as the structural and functional constraints of existing in vitro and animal models, it is hard to gain an understanding of placental transfer. To this end, a physiologically relevant in vitro model of the human placenta is required. In this project, an organ-on-a-chip model of the placental barrier was engineered using Draper's PREDICT96 platform. By capitalizing on this high throughput microfluidic system, the conditions to establish the placental barrier were optimized. To improve upon the model, the flow rates on either side of the barrier were controlled independently with the maternal trophoblast cells receiving low flow while the fetal endothelial cells had a higher flow rate. The BeWo trophoblasts became more confluent when treated with forskolin which improved barrier function. We are currently testing glucose trans - fer across the barrier for comparison to in vivo measurements. From there, the transfer of Tylenol from maternal to fetal side can be assessed using liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry. Our studies point to the feasibility of using the PREDICT96 platform to optimize the in vitro organ-on-a- chip model of the placenta barrier and conduct high DESIGN PROJECTS 77 Microfluidic Pump Optimizes Sample Transport In Integrated Bioreactor magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer to provide automat - ed analysis of liquid cell media from any bioreactor. As bioprocess research and manufacturing grows, there is a growing need for metabolomic analysis that is quick, low-cost and minimizes loss of product. The company's miniaturized NMR spectrometer currently requires manual sam - ple delivery and further streamlined integration between bioreactors and their product is desired. Automation of sample delivery, integration bioreactor and NMR components would allow for high - er data throughput. Our group produced an automated, in-line, pressure-driven sample transport system enabling control and monitoring of bioprocessing parameters. Our novel application of a pressure-driven pump to integrate Bitome's bench-top NMR with a bioreactor allows for consistent microfluidic sample mixing and filtering prior to NMR analysis leading to higher fidelity metabolite analysis. For large-scale data analysis of this kind to be successful, it is essential to optimize the components of sample handling and processing as best as possible. Our team employed in-line pressure sensors with our pump to monitor sample transport flow rate. The use of these sensors, along with optical flow rate monitoring fed to an Arduino microprocessor providing proportional-in - tegral-derivative (PID) control, ensures consistent flow of cell broth through the pump, filters, and mixers. Closed-loop transport ultimately returns the sample back to the bioreactor for continued culture growth, minimizing product loss. 78 BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTSBreaking Barriers in Bioprinting Team Tiffany Lukmantara Harvard Medical School), Kavin Kowsari (BWH & Harvard Medical School) Given the significance of unprecedented biomimicry for artificial organs and tissues, there is an unmet need for a 3D bioprinting technique that can facilitate rapid printing while supporting high cell viability. Conventional extrusion or droplet dispensing printing is too time-consuming due to the constraint of layer-specific molds and exposes cells to high shear stresses at the nozzle. The photo - crosslinking technique addresses these limitations by crosslinking two-dimensional (2D) layers in a single exposure through modulation of the light source. However, existing photocrosslinking-based methods rely on cytotoxic ultraviolet-sensitive photoinitiators. The goal of this study is to develop a novel 3D bioprinting technique that eliminates the use of toxic components and cell-damaging UV irradiation. We propose to funnel through different compositions of biocompatible monomers, photoinitiators, and co-initiators to formulate an optimal bio-ink and utilize an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) microdisplay as a visible light modulator to photocrosslink 2D layers. Human cells will then be embedded into these hydrogel layers using the CleCell U-FAB machine. In this study, we discovered an optimal bio-ink with a rapid photocrosslinking time of 1 minute and demonstrated successful attachment of cerebral endothelial cells on multi-layered three-dimensional (3D) hydro - gel structures fabricated using the OLED platform and CleCell U-FAB machine. This integration of an innovative biocompatible ink with a high-throughput OLED printing platform carries great potential in the wide range of tissue engineering applications and is a step closer to mimicking the complex biological shapes and structures of the human body.

This technology has gained interest recently for its ability to enhance drug discovery at preclinical stages for the testing of new drugs. Draper has developed PREDICT96, a unique high-throughput OOC platform that is capable of supporting vascular models under physiologically relevant fluid shear stress. Although the PREDICT96 has a longer viability and function compared to the static culture system, the lifespan has not been tested for longer than two weeks. The goal of this project is to test the current lifetime limits and then improve the model with enhanced longevity to 2-3 months. To extend the model's lifetime, we will target its barrier function by co-culturing pri - mary human coronary endothelial and smooth muscle cells, exposing the endothelial layer to high fluid shear stress, and adding various factors. To test if the model is able to respond and recover from drug perturbations, an anti-inflammatory drug is added and the response is physically and chemically characterized. Early results from trans-epithelial electrical resistance measurements and LIVE/DEAD staining have elucidated that co-cultured high shear stress devices contained more viable cells with a stronger barrier. Other factors, such as forskolin, were also shown to im - prove barrier function. BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTS 81 Projects Previously PresentedBME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTS 83 Improving Management, Detection, and Treatment of Iron-Deficiency Anemia With Rapid, Portable, and Affordable Next-Generation Point-of-Care Diagnostic Preeti Putcha (Synthera Health) Around five million people in the US currently suffer from iron deficiency anemia (IDA), but expen - sive and inconvenient standard blood testing options tend to lead to significantly late detection of this condition, thereby reducing the effectiveness of treatment options. The cost of repeating standard blood tests, which often process in several hours to days, can quickly become a great burden for patients in areas with relatively low health care resources who wish to test frequently. Potential lack of affordable transportation to well-equipped medical facilities also proposes an ob - stacle to consistent testing. Furthermore, even patients in developed, high cost-of-living areas with adequate medical resources are typically not tested enough to properly track and evaluate iron levels. Most standard blood tests also rely solely on hemoglobin sample detection to interrogate iron health status, ignoring other important markers which may also provide indicative medical in - formation. To address these shortcomings, an affordable, novel, paper-based point of care (POC) diagnostic test for iron deficiency anemia will allow for rapid at-home testing for IDA. Utilization of multiple detection analytes and chemical paper mediums, which have colorimetric properties, will allow for more comprehensive analysis and can be operated with minimal sample preparation and knowledge by the user. Testing of iron biomarkers to evaluate iron health through this device will be repeatable at any desired frequency with little to no additional cost and provide results within mere minutes, offering a convenient and efficient solution to the existing IDA diagnostic barriers. Characterization of A Subcutaneous Bleb Model Team 29: Jordan Barker, Thomas Settelmayer Technical Edward Tang (Takeda Pharmaceuticals) 84 BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTSSubcutaneous large volume infusions play a critical role in drug therapies that require continu - ous delivery at low dosages. Delivered into adipose tissue underneath the epidermis and dermis, subcutaneous injections provide many advantages over intravenous administration, including of - fering the possibility of at-home treatment, reducing user error and reducing overall care costs. Despite these advantages, subcutaneous administration of large volume infusions can lead to the formation of blebs that produce concentrated pressure, further leading to complications for pa - tients receiving treatment. When utilizing subcutaneous injection volumes greater than 1 mL, these complications from bleb formation can include injection pain, high subcutaneous back pressure, leakage and reactions at the injection site. Current research on the formation of subcutaneous blebs is primarily performed through costly and laborious animal studies. Furthermore, these ani - mal studies generally lack in providing sufficient quantitative data for analysis. To solve the issues associated with conventional animal studies, a three-part in-silico computer model was developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals with the goal of assessing the contributing factors in predicting patient complications from bleb formations. The current computer modeling relies on the assumption that human subcutaneous tissue is a uniform space, which is not representative of real-world data and was unable to reproduce in vivo testing results. By conducting ex vivo studies utilizing proprietary subcutaneous modeling, we propose research guided solutions to flaws associated with Takeda's current computer model. Results of the conducted ex vivo studies are ultimately leading to more robust in silico modeling, capable of providing a novel and efficient alternative to in vivo testing of large volume infusion therapies.BME SENIOR DESIGN PROJECTS 85 DDeelliivveerryy Device is inser ted into the brain lesion site DDoossiinngg Device releases drug micr odoses into 33 ccoommppoouunndd 22 ccoommppoouunndd 44 ccoommppoouunndd 11 RReettrriieevvaall sections comparisson for Drug Efficacy Testing in Tumors Team 35: Samantha Downing, Rebecca Janes, Maria Merhej Technical Advisors: Oliver Jonas (BWH & Harvard have emerged as a useful method to improve the processes of cancer treatment. Existing tumor imaging, tumor marking analysis, and other current alternative cancer drug assessment and treatment methods expose patients to drug toxicities, require months to years for results, and may not accurately model in vivo tumor sensitivities. Utilizing IMDs for as - sessment of brain and deep-tissue tumors requires modifications to the size and shape of existing IMD designs. Using clinician input, the brain IMD was redesigned for placement under the menin - ges and is removed with surrounding tissue through a biopsy procedure. Additional adjustments were made for removal by pulling on a nylon suture in the case of an aborted procedure. Force test - ing was performed to determine if the suture interface would be able to withstand estimated remov - al forces. The brain IMD was able to withstand a force over 120% greater than the force required as estimated by the clinician. The brain IMD was also able to withstand a force over 1200% greater than the force as estimated by phantom model testing. The deep-tissue IMD shaft design was significantly modified in order to facilitate minimally invasive retrieval through a 16-gauge needle. In order to evaluate drug effectiveness, a 400 m radius of tissue is needed. The deep-tissue IMD design was tested in phantom gels and tissue samples in order to determine the amount of tissue collected during the biopsy. We plan to further investigate the efficacy of the brain and deep-tissue IMDs by conducting animal trials to evaluate their drug eluting properties.
