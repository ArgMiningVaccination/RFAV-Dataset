Delivering products and services that satisfy the needs and expectations of audiences, and that meet the ABC's editorial standards, is the essence of the ABC's existence. Being visible and active in the community, setting high standards of social, environmental and regulatory responsibility is one of the ABC's six strategic goals. The values of integrity, respect, collegiality and innovation are the foundation of the ABC's activities. The ABC is committed to Corporate Social Responsibility and aims to deliver content with integrity, diligence and transparency and acts in the interests of the Australian community. This responsibility ensures the ABC focuses on the impacts of its decisions and business activities on society, the marketplace, and the environment. The ABC is committed to fulfilling its objectives across all business and media activities in a manner that is ethical, financially responsible, manages its impact on the environment and people, and is beneficial to the community. Late this year, the ABC will develop and publish a Sustainability Plan, which will prioritise the ABC's corporate responsibility activities for the next year. One of the six goals in the ABC [Strategic Plan 2010-13](https://about.abc.net.au/reports-publications/abc-strategic-plan-2010-13/) is to be Responsible. For the ABC, this means being visible and active in the community, setting high standards of social, environmental and regulatory responsibility. With over 5 400 employees working in 60 locations across every State and Territory in Australia, the ABC's potential environmental impact is significant. The ABC aims to reduce energy and water consumption, and waste, and supports a range of initiatives to implement more sustainable systems and processes as well as to change employee behaviour. The ABC's [Green @ Work program](https://www.abc.net.au/greenatwork/) coordinates the implementation and reporting of those initiatives. The ABC also considers the commitment to act on environmental issues in their evaluation of potential suppliers. Energy and water consumption Energy consumption represents a significant sustainability risk area for the ABC, as the provision of broadcasting and online services is energy intensive. Increases in the creation and distribution of content by the ABC, has necessarily required the installation of new computer servers and equipment, increasing the ABC's energy needs. The ABC seeks to offset these increases with efficiencies in other areas, and the introduction of \"virtualisation\" software to reduce the impact of computer server hardware on energy consumption. Operational decisions are guided by the ABC's Environmental Policy, Energy Policy (policies will be published early in 2013) and [Corporate Social Responsibility Policy](https://about.abc.net.au/reports-publications/corporate-and-social-responsibility-policy/). Energy consumption is monitored and reported across the ABC's entire domestic operations, excluding ABC Retail sites. The ABC currently monitors and reports water consumption at its capital city sites. Emissions, effluents and waste The ABC currently monitors and reports waste and recycling activities in its capital city sites. Measurement is based on billing information from waste management contractors. Data is reported as part of the Australian Packaging Covenant Survey through the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communications. Initiatives to reduce waste and increase recycling are part of the ABC's Green @ Work program. The ABC uses the National Green Accounts Factors (July 2011) published by the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, to identify and quantify GHG emissions. These are further classified as electricity and fuel. Data is reported in the Commonwealth Government's Online System for Comprehensive Activity Reporting (OSCAR). The [ABC has set targets](https://www.abc.net.au/greenatwork/theabc/) to reduce its carbon emissions. Transport The nature of the ABC's business requires that its people are moved around the country and around the world. The ABC monitors and reports the kilometres travelled by its employees by air and road, and where possible seeks to minimise the impact in terms of fuel consumption and emissions. Additional information about the ABC's environmental performance is available [here.](https://about.abc.net.au/2012-sustainability-reporting-additional-details#Environment) Other links |Inside Plan 2010-2013](https://about.abc.net.au/reports-publications/abc-strategic-plan-2010-13/) [/accordion] The ABC is a diverse organisation with staff working across Australia and the world. The success of the Corporation is built on the commitment, creativity and skills of its people. The ABC is committed to creating an environment in which its people can thrive and are motivated to deliver the very best content to its audiences. Employment and Labour Relations Terms and conditions of employment at the ABC (including remuneration, including penalties and overtime, hours of work, severance and cessation of employment, leave and performance management) are primarily regulated by a series of Enterprise Agreements, negotiated between the ABC and its employees through their respective bargaining representatives. Work Health and Safety As an organisation which has its people at the heart of its operations, health and safety is both a priority and a key risk area for the ABC. The ABC has a comprehensive Work Health and Safety (WHS) management system, collects incident and workers' compensation claim statistics, and monitors its performance against the Comcare National OHS Strategy Targets 2002-12. In its continuing efforts to improve our record in this area, the Board and Executive have identified the need to give Work Health and Safety a higher priority across the ABC. A project team is currently reviewing the ABC's safety performance and systems. The team has a three year brief, commencing July 2012, to devise an ABC wide strategy to minimise incidents, and improve our responses and injury management. The review, conducted through onsite assessment and an online survey of staff, aims to determine what aspects of the ABC's WHS management system work well, and what areas we need to focus on and improve. Equity and Diversity As a Commonwealth authority employer, the ABC is bound by the provisions of the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Act 1987, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, the Age Discrimination Act 2004 and the Fair Work Act 2009. The ABC's Workplace Behaviour Policy that addresses inappropriate behaviour, incompatible with ABC Values in particular bullying, harassment and discrimination and outlines the complaints resolution procedures. The ABC reports its [Equity and Diversity performance annually](https://about.abc.net.au/reports-publications/equity-diversity-annual-report-2011-2012/). The report articulates the ABC's equal employment opportunity program for the purposes of the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Act 1987 as realised through its equity and diversity strategies. These strategies are set out in the ABC's [Equity and Diversity Plan 2012-15](https://about.abc.net.au/reports-publications/abc-equity-and-diversity-plan-2012-15/) and the ABC [Reconciliation Action Plan 2013-15](https://about.abc.net.au/reports-publications/abc-reconciliation-action-plan-rap-2013-15/). Training and Education The ABC invests a minimum of 2% of base salary expenditure in training and development ( [Strategic Plan 2010-13](https://about.abc.net.au/reports-publications/abc-strategic-plan-2010-13/) page 15). The nature and volume of training is monitored by the ABC's Learning team within the People and Learning division, and is reported in the ABC Annual Report. The ABC seeks to provide a range of training and development opportunities focused on both strategic and operational priorities. Training and development is provided via courses and seminars, on-the-job projects, coaching sessions, and remotely using webinars and e-learning packages. A current focus is on training that is designed to enhance understanding of changes in digital technologies, including web technologies, use of social media and use of multi-platform production techniques. Media leadership and scholarship programs also form critical parts of the ABC's overall [development program](https://www.abc.net.au/careers/workinghere/developing.htm). The ABC also has systems in place to provide opportunities for [work experience, cadetships and internships](https://www.abc.net.au/careers/cadetshipsandworkexperience/). Additional information about the ABC's employment and labour relations performance is available [here.](https://about.abc.net.au/2012-sustainability-reporting-additional-details#Social) Other links The ABC is a publicly-funded broadcaster, relying on appropriations from government to fund its operations. Financial sustainability is a key focus for the ABC. In managing its budgets, the ABC aims to chart a careful balance between addressing vital pressure points and concerns for the ABC, including news content and multi-platform activities, while at the same time ensuring existing content, facilities and operations are maintained at sustainable levels. Divisions such as ABC Resources seek continuous improvements in operating practices, to ensure efficiency and effectiveness, thereby releasing additional funding to content priorities. The Corporation has submitted its next Triennial Funding Submission to Government for consideration in the May 2013 Budget. As part of this process, the Corporation will continue to liaise with Government on sustainability issues, including funding requirements for asset replacement. A proportion of the ABC's total revenue comes from its commercial operations. Financial performance of ABC Commercial is monitored closely, and overseen by the ABC Board. The ABC monitors its financial performance on an ongoing basis, and reports on its financial performance annually. The ABC's Financial Statements are audited by the Australian National Audit Office. Additional information about the ABC's financials is available [here.](https://about.abc.net.au/2012-sustainability-reporting-additional-details#Economic) Other links Shop](http://shop.abc.net.au/?WT.svl=explore) The ABC plays an important role in Australian communities, not only because of the content that is broadcast and published, but also because employees live and work in those communities. Engaging with and building those communities is an explicit objective of the ABC [Strategic Plan 2010-13](https://about.abc.net.au/reports-publications/abc-strategic-plan-2010-13/). Public Benefit The ABC plays an important role working with community groups. Through its Local Radio network and ABC Local websites, the ABC provides Community Service Announcements and information about fundraising and other activities in local communities. It also hosts the Big Diary, where community events are listed. ABC Television regularly carries Community Service Announcements. The ABC has a comprehensive workplace giving program in place for staff. Staff can make personal contributions to nominated charities via their payroll. The ABC also runs a self-supporting Tours program to the public for a minimal charge. The Public can participate in Tours at most of the ABC's capital city sites and get a glimpse of how the ABC works. The ABC Exhibition trailer is a unique initiative that was conceived by staff in 2001. The trailer tours Australia and may be seen at community events or schools. The unique trailer encourages users to engage with a broad range of ABC programs and platforms. Emergency Broadcasting Emergency broadcasting is an important element of the ABC's role in the community. The ABC works to maintain and build relationships with emergency services organisations and communities. Formal arrangements are maintained through Memoranda of Understandings and ongoing liaison between ABC Radio's Manager Emergency Broadcasting and ABC Local Radio Managers in each state and territory. The ABC measures community perceptions and beliefs about the value of the ABC's contribution to Australian society through the annual ABC Appreciation Survey conducted by Newspoll. Public policy The ABC makes submissions to government, parliamentary and law reform bodies on issues which are relevant to public broadcasting. Publicly available submissions are published online. The ABC complies with Senate Continuing Order Number 5 (the Harradine List). International Community ABC's International Division facilitates cross-cultural communication, encourages awareness of Australia and builds regional partnerships. ABC International Development works with public broadcasters throughout Asia and the Pacific, to support communications for development in partner countries, and increase the demand for good governance. The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) is the principal source of funding for ABC International Development. Other links The ABC's ability to have an impact on audiences and communities is primarily through its content and related events and activities. The ABC sets high standards of quality, independence and integrity for itself, and closely regulates its compliance with those standards. Content creation and delivery Consistent and rigorous editorial standards are critical to the ABC's ability to meet its legislative obligations and public expectations. The ABC Board is, among other things, required to \"maintain the independence and integrity\" of the Corporation. It is responsible for developing codes of practice in relation to programming matters on the ABC's services. These form the basis of the Corporation's more detailed Editorial Policies. The [ABC Editorial Policies](https://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/our-editorial-policies/) are the ABC's leading standards and a day-to-day reference for makers of content for radio, television, online and print. They give practical shape to statutory obligations in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, in particular the obligations to: provide services of a high standard; maintain independence and integrity; and ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. The [ABC Editorial Policies](https://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/our-editorial-policies/) consist of Principles and Standards: the Principles identify the ABC's approach to each of the main issues to be addressed by an independent public broadcaster that regulates itself; the Standards, which follow each statement of Principle, are enforceable under internal management processes and under the ABC Complaints Handling Procedures. Complaints under the ABC [Code of Practice](https://about.abc.net.au/reports-publications/code-of-practice-2013/) are also investigated internally and unresolved matters may be investigated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, a federal government statutory authority. There is also detailed and regularly updated guidance provided to program teams on how to ensure compliance with these standards and principles. Audience interaction and accessibility Effective feedback and interaction with audiences is fundamental to creating relevant and meaningful content. Feedback is obtained through: - annual surveys conducted by Newspoll - directly through Community Forums - via online feedback mechanisms - through the ABC Advisory Council - contact with the [ABC's Audience and Consumer Affairs](https://about.abc.net.au/talk-to-the-abc/feedback-and-enquiries/complaints-process/)department - direct contact with our local stations across Australia - direct contact with news and current affairs program teams The ABC seeks to improve accessibility of content to disability groups. The ABC's [Ramp Up](https://www.abc.net.au/rampup/) website provides news, discussion and debate about disability issues in Australia. As well as aggregating all ABC content on disability-related topics, the site provides a forum for Australia's disability communities to share opinions and debate issues. [Ramp Up](https://www.abc.net.au/rampup/) is produced by the ABC with funding assistance from the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA). The ABC meets (and exceeds) the captioning requirements of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. A closed captioning service is provided on ABC1, ABC2, ABC4Kids and ABC3 and ABC News 24. A captioning service is provided on iview for programs that were broadcast in prime time on ABC1 and ABC2. The ABC has recently completed a trial of an Audio Description service on ABC1. The trial ran for 13 weeks from 5 August 2012 and broadcast an average 2 of hours of audio described content a day in prime time. The ABC is currently drafting a report for the Government on the trial. Media literacy in a digital world The ABC contributes to digital and media literacy in order to enable audiences to express themselves, understand and engage with content and to contribute to the production of content. The [ABC Open](https://open.abc.net.au/) initiative provides extensive opportunities for regional Australians to engage with the ABC and to improve their digital and media literacy. The ABC's [Technology Explained](https://www.abc.net.au/technology/techexplained/) initiative aims to dispel the myths around new technologies and devices, and help people learn how to navigate the digital world. Other links The ABC contributes to the protection of human rights in a number of ways: by respecting human rights in the preparation and presentation of content; by drawing attention to human rights issues through relevant and appropriate content; and by endeavouring to reflect international human rights standards in the ABC's business processes. The ABC's [Corporate Social Responsibility Policy](https://about.abc.net.au/reports-publications/corporate-and-social-responsibility-policy/) outlines the ABC's commitment to key principles of corporate social responsibility, which include adhering to relevant laws and regulations and respecting human rights. Freedom of expression and portrayal related to human rights The [ABC Editorial Policies](https://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/our-editorial-policies/) include Principles and Standards which support the ABC's independence and freedom of expression, as well as supporting society's rights to freedom of expression. The [ABC Editorial Policies](https://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/our-editorial-policies/) ensure that the portrayal of all sectors in our community in ABC content is fair and accurate, and that a diversity of viewpoints is presented. These aspects are demonstrated in a number of sections of the Editorial Policies, including: - Independence, integrity and responsibility (Section 1) - Accuracy (Section 2) - Impartiality and diversity of perspectives (Section 4) - Fair and honest dealing (Section 5) - Harm and offence (Section 7) - Children and young people (Section 8) - Public access and participation (Section 9). Freedom of Information (FOI) The right to seek and impart information is enshrined in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which the Australian is a signatory. In Australia, access to information is governed by the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act). The ABC provides information in response to [FOI requests](https://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/freedom-of-information/) and also uses the provisions of the FOI Act to seek information from government bodies as part of its journalistic activities. Privacy The ABC recognises that privacy is necessary to human dignity and every person reasonably expects that their privacy will be respected. However, privacy is not absolute, and the ABC seeks to balance the public interest in respect for privacy with the public interest in disclosure of information and freedom of expression ( [ABC Editorial Policies](https://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/our-editorial-policies/), Principle 6). The ABC has systems and processes in place to ensure compliance with the obligations under the Privacy Act 1988. Culture and identity The ABC's Charter includes an obligation to \"broadcast programs that contribute to a sense of national identity ... and reflect the cultural diversity of the Australian community\". Promoting and contributing to culturally significant issues and activities is fundamental to the ABC's content strategy. The ABC's Reconciliation Action Plan commits the Corporation to a long-term course of action to improve opportunities for Indigenous Australians in the areas of employment, content, community links and cultural understanding and respect. Increasing [Indigenous employment opportunities](https://www.abc.net.au/careers/workinghere/indigenous.htm) at the ABC is a key part of both the RAP and the ABC's broader Corporate Responsibility strategy. In its Indigenous Protocols at ABC Events Policy the ABC sets out guidelines for showing respect to Australia's Indigenous heritage at ABC functions and events, either by making an Acknowledgement of Country address or performing a Welcome to Country ceremony, as appropriate. The policy will be published online in 2013. Other links The ABC Annual Report is the primary method by which the ABC communicates its annual corporate responsibility and sustainability performance. In 2011-12, the ABC continued to align its sustainability data and reporting with the internationally recognised Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework for sustainability reporting, and the GRI Media Sector Supplement. The GRI framework provides a common language for organisations to measure and report their sustainability performance. The framework relies on the key reporting principles of materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, and completeness.
