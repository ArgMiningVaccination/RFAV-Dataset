Kay When I moved for college to the Great Lakes region, I was shocked by the suddenness with which lovely fall weather could swing into a harsh preview of winter. Sometimes, I am still surprised.Looking at where our flowerbeds flourished only a few months earlier, I think about the sleeping plants buried deep beneath the snow. It will be a long time before the first buds of spring start to swell.With a decisive \"click,\" the storm windows lock into place, and the quiet season begins. ... bare branches rasp and creak... ... I look up at the sharp, white stars, waiting. Throughout the neighborhood, only tree bones reach up into the cold sky.my boots seems to travel a shorter distance than usual. House lights glow through closed windows that seal any noise within. Inside, the fire burns with a rushing, wind-like sound, like a gale through the eaves. Cars whisper past. Our lives settle into an indoor rhythm. The dog, burly and bear-like in his winter coat, spends more of his time curled up and snoozing. Flannel sheets go on the bed. Even they are quieter than the cool, rustling linens of summer. Soup burbles on the stove. The furnace roars out its hot breath for a while and then quiets again. We push against the cold with hot cups of tea or cocoa. The din of the traffic on the big cross street a couple of blocks away, which passes easily through summer windows, cannot penetrate the storm glass. When a major snowstorm hits, evergreen boughs bend under the weight. On the side streets, people await the city plows, hoping that they will come sooner this time. Snow blowers burst into action, the racket of their small engines evocative of the lawnmowers of summer, and then fall silent again. Our snow shovel grates against buried concrete as we clear the sidewalk. Large piles of shoveled snow appear next to driveways like gateposts and soon turn grey with the salty, dirty spray from the plows. Looking at where our flowerbeds flourished only a few months earlier, I think about the sleeping plants buried deep beneath the snow. It will be a long time before the first buds of spring start to swell. Embracing the possibilities that the snowfall offers, we join our neighbors for cross-country skiing in Huron Meadows Metropark on a chilly afternoon. Or our family tromps over to the big sledding hill at Slauson School. We ride double or even triple on our long sleds, the added weight speeding us down the steep slope. Against the quiet of the season, we bellow our joy and a touch of thrilled fear as we race to the bottom. We laugh like crazy at the end of the ride, often a crash that leaves us tumbled and jumbled in a happy pile of snowy bodies. The children want to hit the run where other kids have created a jump. They invite us to do it, too, but my wife and I demur and leave that one to their younger joints and bones. As we watch them rocket down and launch gleefully into the air, it occurs to me that much of the pleasure of parenthood comes in watching my children dare to do what they would not just a few years ago. Back at home, the children build snow forts and dig tunnels in the front yard. Later, we'll make more tea and cocoa, wrap cold hands around our mugs, and blow the steam away in wisps until we can take our first, tentative sips. When I take the dog for his bedtime stroll on a clear night in the heart of winter, he sticks his nose deep in the snow to snuffle about, and I look up at the sharp, white stars, waiting. The sky seems blacker than at any other time of year. The thin air is frigid, making my nostrils stiffen at their edges and my eyelids stick together when I blink. A neighbor comes out of his house to rummage in his car. After he finds whatever he's looking for, he straightens and notices me. We have known each other for a decade. In warmer months, we chat about yards and bikes and his retirement travels. Now, he only nods and hurries inside. His front door clicks shut, and I return to the stars. Orion hunts in the cold winter sky.With a decisive \"click,\" the storm windows lock into place, and the quiet season begins. The sounds outside fall distant, muffled until mid-spring. The days are cool, the nights dip toward freezing, and the easy, outdoorsy time of summer and early autumn has passed. The leaves have turned. Snow will come soon. When it does, my children will gush with excitement, especially my daughter, who has proclaimed winter her favorite season. Standing with them at the window to watch the early snowfall, my wife and I will join in their anticipation, though ours will be tinged with sobering thoughts of the grey skies that will predominate for months and the challenges of coping with cold, snow, and ice. I grew up in Los Angeles, with its stunted seasons. The stable climate made most days as indistinct as the horizon behind the usual, shimmering haze. The weather was generally dry and mild, and the smoggy, blue-grey sky stretched over the green Pacific. Sometimes cool, clear air flowed in and broke the pattern, and the San Gabriel Mountains stood sharp and tall northeast of the city. Those crisp days felt as if they were borrowed from some other place, like I had experienced on trips to the Sierras and visits to my parents' native Chicago. On those days, Los Angeles felt to me like a city where colored leaves could mark the autumn, and the fresh green of spring might slowly reveal itself after a long winter. But such days were the exceptions that proved the rule. I grew up in a place where the grass required mowing year-round, and there was no need for storm windows. When I moved for college to the Great Lakes region, I was shocked by the suddenness with which lovely fall weather could swing into a harsh preview of winter. Sometimes, I am still surprised. Often, by Halloween, a few cold, damp, blustery days have sent snowflakes or ice pelting sideways to sting our faces, and we tuck our chins deep into our collars. Wind and hard rains hammer the leaves out of the trees. Soon, lawns and walks and streets are slick with glistening mats that we dutifully scrape up with rakes loosed from their summer storage places. My wife and I rummage among the gloves and hats stashed in a bin and set them out for the season on top of what we call the \"shoe shelf\" in the front hall. Boots come up from the basement, and sandals are sent down. When cold temperatures come to stay, all becomes quiet. In the morning, the roof shingles wink in the sun under a frosting of silver crystals. During the day, there is no buzz of cicadas or low hum of bumblebees on their rounds. At night, there is no high, whistling chirp of insects, no soft, breathy whir of a lightning bug near my ear. Instead, bare branches rasp and creak, so different from the whooshing rustle of colorful leaves leaping in the wind just a few weeks earlier. Throughout the neighborhood, only tree bones reach up into the cold sky. Snow flurries and showers whiten the landscape and challenge drivers. When I venture out on a walk, I usually have the street to myself, enveloped by the quiet of the season. The winter solstice looms out of the lengthening darkness. If the snow is thick enough, it sucks into silence whatever sound might otherwise have echoed down the block. Even the crunching of The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 6 Ten years ago, I lucked into a career in the arts. I say \"lucked into\" because there are loads of other qualified, experienced, arts-loving, ambitious people trying do exactly what I'm doing. The field is competitive; hundreds of people submit their candidacy for a single part-time opening at some of the organizations I've worked with. I don't take my position for granted and when I can, I try to help others interested in pursuing careers in the field. To this end, I've been serving on a number of college student career panels, providing living, breathing proof of the ever-elusive \"career in the arts.\" Students have lots of questions for me, but one question in particular keeps cropping up: \"How did you find your passion?\" I hate this question. It never fails to make me feel like a floundering hack. My \"passion\" for the arts isn't Amelia Earhart's plane or my car keys we're talking about; I know exactly where it is at all times. Great art has always been what I get out of bed for in the morning. It's the thing I can't stop talking about. How can you even go about misplacing something like that? More importantly, how is it that a generation of students has been taught that career passion is critical and yet hasn't the foggiest idea of what that means for them? According to Lisa Inoue, L.M.S.W. and co-facilitator of the Ann Arbor Mindful Parenting Group, children as young as three show a special affinity for certain activities; it just takes a parent's attunement to notice and provide appropriate structure for the child's developmental stage and personality in order for that interest to blossom. \"Young children have an innate sense of 'this feels good in my body and I love it,'\" said Inoue. \"What is trickier to parse out is 'this feels good in my body and my mom is so proud of me when I do it.'\" While encouraging desired behavior through positive parental response is critical, Inoue said that it is just as important for parents to validate the child's attempts at \"being different.\" Encouraging their individual expression gives children the emotional skills they need to self-discover with confidence as they get older. So when my five-year-old daughter, Lila, insists on making her own wardrobe selections \u2014 complete with mis-matched tube socks, a thousand bead necklaces, and wild, unbrushed hair \u2014 I just need to let that look happen. Aside from the fact that I don't relish spending precious time in the morning arguing about how many legwarmers are too many, I will now take total solace in the idea that Lila's self-curated style might give her practice at confidently defining her role in the world in larger ways down the road. Ultimately, our job as parents is to prepare our kids for these \"down the road\" moments, but it is really easy to get caught up in the warm glow of nostalgia when we're with our kids. I was convinced that my daughter would love hiking because I loved it as a girl; she hates it along with museums and Charlotte's Web, two of my other childhood favorites. Every time I feel myself becoming insistent that Lila have these experiences, I try to remember my youth soccer coach, Dan. Once a spry f\u00fatbol player, Dan was a sagging grey man trying to re-live his youth through a gangly group of third grade girls he dubbed The Orange Crushers. None of us Crushers were particularly \"passionate\" about soccer but we liked running around outside and we lived in the suburbs, so why not? Our attitude of casual exploration, of childhood curiosity: this was infuriating to Dan. At each game, our clumsy kicks, our flinching at the goal created a volcanic rage in him. His face would redden, his arms would shake, he'd rip the attendance sheet from his clipboard and tear it in two. We'd watch him from the field, mouths agape. It was funny, it was scary, and it was sad. He was the dad of one of the teammates and we felt bad for her, even though she was terrible at understanding social cues (imagine that) and had really stringy hair. I'd never want to shampoo properly either if I had a tyrant like that living in my house , I thought. I'd just want to hide . Dan was forcing his passion for soccer on his child and her schoolmates and it was a disaster. We Orange Crushers were privy to what must've been the cause of much of her social awkwardness. It was a learning moment then and continues to be one for me now. Eventually, Dan was fired from his volunteer position of soccer coaching and replaced by another dad who didn't call his eight-year-old charges \"little shits.\" We can't control what our kids love and what they don't. We can introduce ideas and facilitate learning, but after that we have to step back. We can't live vicariously through our kids \u2014 we have to let them choose their own passions. I want to give Lila free reign over her pursuits, but what if this road to self-discovery leads to a place where she drops out of college to front a Kenny G tribute band? Or spends a summer as a Tea Party intern on the 2028 campaign trail? \"It's reasonable that a parent would be concerned,\" said Inoue. \"Every parent wants their children to have quality of life and be able to support themselves. Parents need to have a warm, open, and loving conversation with their child about their concerns.\" They also need to accept the outcomes of those conversations. Inoue said: If they feel their child should study something more practical alongside their 'passion project,' they should say so. And the child may say, 'No, this is what I'm meant to do and I'm doing it.' At that point, the parent needs to work on untangling their well-being from the well-being of their child. As children become adults, a healthy parent-child relationship depends on this acceptance. While my parents were unfailingly supportive of my artistic pursuits in young adulthood, my husband's parents were less than thrilled when he \"came out\" as a writer in college. His parents are incredibly hardworking people, a line-worker at GM and an inner-city school teacher. Shaun's parents wanted nothing more than for their son to have a stable \"forever job\" in engineering or business. He chose English. He couldn't help but write and had a nearly insatiable craving to get better at it. In his adult life, Shaun's always held a day job, paying his share of rent by using his editorial and writing skills in the realms of journalism, marketing, and publishing. But he's also tenaciously pursued a career as a creative writer. After ten years of freelance, ghostwriting, and publication in obscure literary journals, we celebrated his first big project with a publisher this May. While Shaun bristles at the word \"passion,\" it is clear that he is deeply dedicated to exploring the world, exploring ideas, and starting conversations through writing. And to get to this place, he had to make a choice: to live with the discomfort of parental disapproval. Shaun's word of caution: \"Parents aren't the only ones who need to untangle their well-being from the well-being of others; young adults may also find themselves doing the same.\" \"This is a defining developmental step during the college years,\" said Inoue. \"Young adults are parsing out who they are and defining the life they want to live.\" by Truly Render Zen and the Art of Hamster Maintenance ~ Thoughts on Passion, Purpose, and Parenting My \"passion\" for the arts isn't Amelia Earhart's plane or my car keys we're talking about; I know exactly where it is at all times. ... how is it that a generation of students has been taught that career passion is critical and yet hasn't the foggiest idea of what that means for them?

We can introduce ideas and facilitate learning, but after that we have to step back. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 7 Perhaps thinking of one's life work as \"passion\" just really isn't helpful for some people. In his original graphic novel On Purpose, Dr. Vic Strecher, Professor and Director for Innovation and Social Entrepreneurship at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, offers readers a fresh way of thinking about the life they want to live, arguing that purpose, not passion, may be at the root of health and happiness. \"Passion comes from purpose,\" said Strecher. \"It is the commitment, drive, and engagement that motivates purpose. Purpose is what happens when you're able to identify your core values, think outside yourself, and apply those values to the world at large.\" On Purpose, based on a course Strecher teaches at U-M, provides an interactive approach for readers to discover their purpose, weaving in personal story, historical anecdotes, scientific research, and philosophy. An app accompanies the book, allowing readers to keep a daily log of how their activities align with their stated purpose. In the book and on numerous idea festival circuits worldwide (including TED Talks and the Aspen Ideas Festival), Strecher encourages people to embrace the concept of purpose for the sake of their health. The book cites numerous studies that draw strong correlations between purpose and longevity, purpose and greater sexual satisfaction, purpose and fighting addiction, and even purpose and avoiding illnesses like Alzheimer's disease. \"Many students struggle with the question of purpose because their purpose has been imposed upon them,\" said Strecher. \"You see these birth announcements where parents are introducing their newborns as 'Future Doctor,' and while I'm sure it's tongue-in-cheek, it's often the start of a destructive life-long relationship where kids are bullied into a purpose by their parents.\" \"That said, it is equally problematic when students fall in love with an activity very early on in life and decide it is their purpose to the exclusion of all else.\" I tend to agree with Vic on this one. Career limitations aside: people who do this make awful conversationalists. \"My advice to students: don't worry about having a purpose in your twenties. Learn as much as you can about the world; take classes in subjects that you don't know anything about, travel, talk to people who have different opinions than those you hold, absorb the world without judgment. Only by doing this can students create values that are truly their own, leading to the discovery of purpose,\" he said. Recently, I asked Lila what her purpose was in life. She answered, \"To feed my pets everyday.\" While most adults might be tempted to laugh this answer off and fish for a purpose with a tangible career trajectory, Strecher commended Lila with sincerity. \"That is amazing,\" he said, \"she's thinking outside of herself, thinking of others. That is the self-transcendence that you need to define purpose.\" The great thing about purpose as Vic Strecher defines it is that it can \u2014 and probably will \u2014 change over time. While I don't expect that Lila's life will always revolve around providing breakfast seeds for her hamster, I feel good about her ability to discover her own values, to find her purpose in life when the times comes. I give Shaun and myself a solid parenting B+ on that front. If Lila chooses to spend her life honoring a smooth jazz saxophonist, we're ready to have that tough conversation. But in the meantime, we'll do our best to stay attuned to her curiosities, encourage broad learning about the world around us, and refrain from calling anyone under the age of 10 a little shit.

When not at work or swimming with her daughter at the YMCA, Truly enjoys reading, writing, and enjoying the incredible cultural offerings of southeastern Michigan with friends and family. ... my husband's parents were less than thrilled when he \"came out\" as a writer in college. \" My advice to students: don't worry about hav- ing a purpose in your twenties. Learn as much as you can about the world...absorb the world with- out judgment. Only by doing this can students create values that are truly their own, leading to the discovery of purpose. \" - Dr. Vic Strecher The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 8 Questions for Camille Noe Pag\u00e1n, Author of The Art of Forgetting Interview by Julianne Linderman Photos by Joni Strickfaden Camille Noe Pag\u00e1n, age 36, is an author and journalist. Her successful first novel, The Art of Forgetting, was published in 2011 by Penguin. The book was met with considerable acclaim from readers and critics, with the Chicago Tribune calling it \"a quietly compelling literary debut . . . about the power of friendship and the importance of forgiveness.\" Camille lives in Ann Arbor with her husband, JP, and their two young children \u2014 Indira, 6, and Xavier, 4. Raised in the Detroit area, she attended the University of Michigan and studied English. Upon graduation, she attended the six-week Radcliffe Publishing Course at Harvard University, which propelled her into her career as a writer. After the course, Camille moved to Brooklyn, where she worked as a health and nutrition writer for nearly a decade (writing for such publications as Glamour, Fitness, and Women's Health). In August 2010, she moved to Ann Arbor with her family. Her next novel is in the works, and she continues to be a regular contributor to national magazines in the health/nutrition field. Recently, I met with Camille to talk about her book, other writings, and life in Ann Arbor. Meeting with her was a pleasure; having devoured The Art of Forgetting in two or three sittings, I was certainly eager to get the inside scoop on how it all came about. The Art of Forgetting explores the close friendship between Marissa Rogers and Julia Ferrar, two young women who are pursuing their career dreams in New York City a few years after graduating from the University of Michigan. But when Julia suffers a traumatic brain injury after a sudden accident, her memory and personality are drastically altered, and both women's lives take unexpected turns. As the plot unfolds in this thoughtful and intelligent book, so do deeper themes about friendship and self-acceptance. *** Julianne Linderman: Can you tell us a little about how you got the idea for The Art of Forgetting? Camille Noe Pag\u00e1n: I'm a journalist specializing in health, nutrition, and wellness. Before I wrote Forgetting, I knew about brain injury because news outlets were increasingly covering it, particularly in regard to football players' and troops' injuries. It wasn't until I began writing a Women's Health story about brain health, though, that I realized just how prevalent traumatic brain injury is in young women. The fact that one seemingly small event \u2014 a fall, a car accident, a sporting injury \u2014 could affect a person's personality, possibly forever, was profound, and I wanted to explore the topic in a fiction format. Julianne Linderman: Has it always been a dream of yours to write fiction? How long have you been writing fiction? Camille Noe Pag\u00e1n: I've been writing stories since I could hold a pencil; my mother often sends me little \"books\" or stories I wrote as a small girl, which she'll find tucked away in drawers and boxes. Winning a young author contest in third or fourth grade was one of the highlights of my childhood, and I think I always knew, deep down, that I ultimately wanted to write books. Even so, I attended college on a full academic scholarship, and I think because of that, I felt a lot of pressure \u2014 most of it internal, no doubt \u2014 to do something \"practical.\" I took creative writing classes during college, but initially planned to be a physician or something similar, like a researcher. When it became obvious that I was a far better writer than science student, I decided to go into publishing. That was a very good decision, as working as a magazine editor and later a journalist gave me the ability to earn a living doing what I love \u2014 writing. I didn't try my hand at writing novels until my late twenties. Forgetting was the first novel I completed start to finish. After its publication, though, I wrote several other novels that I really didn't like, and didn't attempt to sell. Julianne Linderman: How did the title come about? Camille Noe Pag\u00e1n: The title came to me after I wrote roughly half the book. It more or less just popped into my head, but I knew immediately that it was just right for this story \u2014 it touches on the brain injury aspect of the story, but also on the fact that Marissa must ultimately choose whether or not to move past the issues she has with her old friend. Publishers often suggest new titles for novel manuscripts. I was thrilled when Penguin agreed that The Art of Forgetting was the right title for this story. JL: I found the book to be an inspiring tale for women about discovering healthy self-esteem. Little by little, Marissa Rogers, the main character, shows signs of becoming more assertive and less self-critical. Is this something you hoped readers would take away from the book? CNP: Thank you! Many readers assume that the character of Marissa was inspired by my own experiences. While there are parts of me in her \u2014 and all of my characters, really \u2014 I was inspired to write her after interviewing literally hundreds of women over the several years I worked as an editor. It struck me that no matter how different these women were \u2014 unique jobs, life circumstances, personalities \u2014 they often shared a common issue, which was the struggle to accept themselves for who they are, rather than who they want to be or who society tells them they should be. As with the topic of brain injury, I wanted to examine this struggle in fiction. JL: And it seems that through Marissa's character, this struggle is conveyed most strongly. It was refreshing to read about a young woman, nearing 30 years old, who, despite having a fantastic job as a magazine editor in NYC and a great relationship, certainly does not \"have it all together\" beneath the surface. Can you comment more on how you developed her character and Julia's? CNP: Fiction is such a weird process that it's hard to explain how I develop my characters; for me, the more I write, the more I \"know\" my characters, and that allows me to go back and edit early drafts of work to make them even more true versions of themselves. That said, both Marissa and Julia came to me quickly and organically. I knew that I wanted to write a protagonist who struggled with real issues that affect many women. And I wanted her best friend to be the woman who looks like she has it all, but who, in reality, also struggles with self-esteem issues and doesn't have it all together. JL: You mentioned that after the book came out, many readers wanted to talk about the \"love triangle.\" Can you briefly describe the love triangle, and why readers may want to talk about it, for those who may not have read the book? CNP: The love triangle you're referring to is between Marissa, Julia, and Marissa's college boyfriend, Nathan. When Julia discovered that Marissa and Nathan were dating, she was jealous \u2014 and also attracted to him. So she asked Marissa to let him go, and in spite of her better judgment, Marissa agreed. Now, a decade later, Marissa and Julia both reconnect with Nathan, and the reader is left wondering what the outcome will be. I think so many readers related to this part of the story because we all have someone from our past that we wonder about \u2014 a person about whom you can't help but think, \"What if we'd stayed together?\" or \"What if we got back together?\" The fact that one seemingly small event \u2014 a fall, a car accident, a sporting injury \u2014 could affect a person's personality, possibly forever, was profound, and I wanted to explore the topic in a fiction format.Winning a young author contest in third or fourth grade was one of the highlights of my childhood, and I think I always knew, deep down, that I ultimately wanted to write books. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 9 JL: Part of the book took place in Ann Arbor and part of it in New York. Can you tell us more about these settings? Are there particular things about Ann Arbor that you felt would suit the book well? CNP: I spent my twenties and very early thirties in New York, and knew I wanted to set the book there. But Marissa and Julia needed to have a \"home base,\" and Ann Arbor instantly came to mind; it's such an idyllic college setting, and many of Marissa's flashbacks are set during her time at the University of Michigan. Interestingly, I came to visit Ann Arbor a few times while working on the first draft to double-check my research, so to speak, and ended up liking it so much as an adult (versus when I went to college here) that my husband and I ended up moving here from Brooklyn at the end of 2010. JL: Are you from Michigan? Could you tell us a little more about your upbringing? Perhaps share an interesting story or two from your childhood? CNP: I grew up in the Detroit area. My mother encouraged my sister (who is less than a year younger than me; we grew up almost as twins) to read as much as possible, in part because my mother isn't a fan of television! Some of my most vivid childhood memories center around books: trying to recreate The Egypt Game with a friend; turning my dolls and figurines into different characters from The Chronicles of Narnia. I love the idea of writing children's books and may try that next. JL: You mentioned earlier that you felt some internal pressure to do something \"practical\" when you first attended college. How did your path shift and what inspired you to become a writer? CNP: I've always been very interested in health; my own family has been affected by numerous health conditions, like rheumatoid arthritis, Type I diabetes, depression, and so on. During high school, I thought it made sense for me to channel my health interest by becoming a physician. But in reality, it was evident from my very first semester at U-M that I was much better at writing than I was at science. I did take science courses, though, as well as a lot of psychology-focused work, and during my senior year, I worked in a cardiology lab at U-M's hospital. During that time, my supervisor \u2014 this really wonderful cardiologist, Lori Mosca, M.D., who went out of her way to mentor the students who worked for her \u2014 said, \"You know, Camille, I think you should consider combining your writing ability with your interest in medicine and pursue a career in health publishing.\" That was so important, because it made me realize that I could really have a true career in writing, which is what I not-so-secretly loved to do. I attended a post-graduate course in publishing, then landed my first job as a junior editor at Fitness magazine. I think it was only natural that I would look at a health topic in my first novel; though later fiction projects have been less health-centered. JL: Can you tell us a little more about your journalism career? What do you enjoy most about journalistic writing? CNP: I studied English and Native American literature at U-M. After college, I attended that post-graduate course in publishing at Harvard, then moved to New York City to work in magazine publishing. After serving as a magazine and online editor for several years, I became a full-time journalist in 2004 (I am self-employed, through a small company that I own). There are so many things I love about working as a journalist. I am a naturally curious person, and every new story I write gives me the opportunity to learn something new. Self-employment also allows me a great deal of freedom. I keep regular hours \u2014 and yes, I get dressed every morning instead of working in my PJs \u2014 but if I want to go on vacation or take a morning off to volunteer at my daughter's school, I can. It's great. JL: Was there something in particular that made you want to study Native American literature? CNP: My father's family is part Native American, but (for many complicated reasons that I can't do justice in a small space) my grandparents and great grandparents didn't embrace their heritage, and were not tribal members. Literature was initially a way for me to understand this, and explore the history of Native people in the U.S. That initial interest grew into a true appreciation: I love the work of Louise Erdrich, for example, and of Betty Bell, an author and professor who mentored me in college. JL: Do you ever experience \"writer's block\"? What types of things do you do to find inspiration again?CNP: I don't get writer's block, really, but I think this comes from years of working on deadline. If you want to get paid (or, when I was working in an office, not get fired!), you turn your work in on time. When I work on fiction, I give myself a daily word count, and I stick to it most days. Sometimes the work isn't good and has to be scrapped, but at least I have a draft to work with, and that means I've already done the hardest part. Inspiration isn't an issue, either, really. It's more like I have so many novel ideas that it's tough to know what to work on next! I keep notebooks full of them, and usually the best one bubbles to the surface in my mind, and that's what I'll start on. JL: The task of starting a novel seems like it would be the most difficult (to me at least!). Do you find this stage of the writing process difficult, or no? CNP: Oh, not at all. I could start a million novels; the tough part for me is the ending. I usually have an end in mind when I start, but getting the rhythm of the novel right \u2014 that is, having the story unfold naturally at the right pace \u2014 is tricky, especially in the last third of the book. I usually write the first two-thirds of a story very quickly (often in just a few months), then slow down at the end. JL: What are you working on now, if you're allowed to say? CNP: I just wrapped up a book about a woman whose life falls apart in a single afternoon, and how she attempts to come to terms with that disaster by running off to a fairly remote Caribbean island. It's called Life and Other Near Death Experiences. JL: Have you lined up a publisher? CNP: Lake Union (an Amazon publishing imprint) recently acquired the book and is publishing it in October 2015. JL: I'm also curious about how you find time to write \u2014 as a mother of two young children, I'm sure you are kept quite busy! CNP: The kids aren't the hard part; the full-time job is! My children are in school or preschool most of the workday, but during \"work hours,\" I primarily work on journalism. I write fiction at night and on the weekends, and occasionally squeeze it in on slow workdays. It's sometimes crazy-making, but I also find that I'm more productive when I have less time. Knowing I have an hour to get a chapter done eliminates the temptation to browse the Internet or answer email. JL: In addition to writing, you're also doing some interesting work at Burns Park Elementary School, is that right? Can you describe more about it? CNP: Burns Park has a relatively new principal, Chuck Hatt, who's fantastic. Many Burns Park parents have asked him to take a fresh look at the school's nutrition policies \u2014 not just school lunches but also snacks, and how holidays and birthdays are celebrated. With this in mind, Chuck formed a committee made up of interested, health-focused parents and faculty. This year, we'll begin looking at (and hopefully improving!) the school's nutrition policies so they're more in line with what recent research has shown about the connection between healthful food and excellent academic performance. Nothing's set in stone, but one neat thing we're talking about right now is the idea of healthy competition \u2014 that is, studies show that when kids compete with each other to see who can eat the most fruits and veggies, they consume far more fresh produce than they would otherwise, without feeling like they're being \"forced\" to eat nutritious food. JL: What neighborhood do you live in? What do you like about living here? CNP: My family and I live in Lower Burns Park. As I mentioned, my husband and I moved here from Brooklyn in 2010, after about a decade there (save a few years in Chicago), and our daughter spent the first few years of her life there, in a great neighborhood called Carroll Gardens. When I became pregnant with my son, who is now four, we realized we wanted more space, to be closer to at least one side of our family, and to live in a community where good schools were a given. We often visited Ann Arbor when we came to see my family (who still live in the Detroit area) and decided pretty spontaneously to look for a house here. Many thanks, Camille! I am a naturally curious person, and every new story I write gives me the opportunity to learn something new.During high school, I thought it made sense for me to channel my health interest by becoming a physician. But in reality, it was evident from my very first semester at U-M that I was much better at writing than I was at science. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 10 (Third in a Series) by Lenny Bass This morning, in the middle of a wind-driven rain, I once again heard the voice of the great spruce tree while sitting cross-legged on a love seat facing the wood stove...this time from the interiors of this A-framed cabin. I used to think that the tree and I could only converse if I was \"out there,\" under its magnificent boughs (and, therefore, under its magnificent tutelage), while soaking in the hot tub. And, as well, I used to think that I had to have a least a beer or two in my gut to get the conversation rolling. But, turns out, neither of these things are true. I was as sober as a washrag, and for various reasons, this year the tub was not up and running. I don't know whether to call this \"progress\"...or what. Turns out, the tree can talk right through walls...or ceilings...or whatever you call the side of an A-framed cabin. I was sitting there minding my own business, writing in my journal, when, out of nowhere, it said it wanted to \"chat.\" Only, that's not how it says it, at least not in my experience. Always in the past when it's wanted to converse, it simply announces itself by saying rather abruptly, \"We are trees .\" I'm just telling you this because this is how it happens for me. And if the messages it has given me in these past years weren't so damned relevant to my own life, you could pretty much call me certifiable. I don't know...maybe you still can. Nonetheless, for those who have not read my previous articles, this emboldened tree and I have had an ongoing conversation for the many years I have been coming to this blessed place out in western New York State \u2014 a sixty-acre enclave owned by my wife's family tucked away from all civilization. Well, all civilization except for those I can hear firing off rifles and riding three-wheelers and grinding snowmobiles and buzzing chainsaws and clearing snow off roads. And, as well, a couple miles away, at the edge of the Alleghany Mountains, which are clearly visible from the cabin, there rests a \"small\" highway, a four-lane road that recently was endowed with big time Interstate status. It used to be Highway 17, but now it's Interstate 86, interestingly enough. 86, as in, they totally eighty-six-ed whatever wilderness had been here before. Okay, so maybe it's not so far from civilization as I like to imagine. But it appears that way, deep in the heart of this spruce grove where the tree and the cabin reside. The nearest neighbors, despite their noisy habits, are a half-mile away. And the nearest \"large\" town, two miles from here, has one stop sign, two gas stations, and thankfully, for me, a small grocery store. Other than this, it's a good half an hour by car before you'd reach a town with any population of consequence. By my home standards, this puts me \"out of civilization.\" At any rate, when I \"heard\" the rallying cry \"we are trees \" while sitting there with pen and paper close at hand, I figured, what better time to transcribe verbatim all that the tree had to say? The hot tub certainly doesn't offer this luxury; always I have to \"paraphrase\" what I've heard it say, usually the next day. So, I primed my pen and paper and began writing. \"We are trees,\" it said matter-of-factly. \"Why have you been ignoring us?\"\"I have not been ignoring you,\" I said back. \"It's just that this year my wife isn't coming out here. And, as you know, she spends way more time in the hot tub than I do. And for me to un-winterize the tub, clean out all the antifreeze, add new water, put in new chemicals, heat the thing up...that takes an enormous amount of energy. Then I'd have to undo the whole damned thing a week later. And since she's the one who basically 'lives' in the thing while she's here, I thought I'd...\" \"You are not listening,\" the tree interrupted. \"We asked you a very simple question. We'll ask it again. Why have you been ignoring trees?\" \"Well, if you'd let me finish...\"\"Yada, yada, yada,\" the tree shot back, \"the hot tub this, the hot tub that. Fine, don't sit in the damned hot tub. But that does not answer our question. We'll ask it a third time. Why have you been ignoring trees?\" I sat there a second trying to ponder what it was after. I was merely trying to explain why I hadn't been out in the tub for our traditional conversation and the circumstances surrounding that. Finally, after thinking about it a while, I said with all the maturity a 53-year-old could muster, \"Have not.\" \"Have so,\" it shot back with equal infantile candor. \"Have not, have not, have not!\" I insisted.\"Oh really,\" it said back to me, \"and when you cut down Mrs. Samson's buckthorn last summer, you call that 'paying attention'?\" Mrs. Samson's buckthorn? I sat there a second, completely dumbfounded and blindsided all at once. I lifted my pen to write, but nothing came out. I run a small business back in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I do an assortment of all kinds of \"odd\" jobs. The \"odds\" have included a whole range of things \u2014 weeding, gardening, mulching, pruning...and as well, an occasional cutting down of what's usually referred to as an \"invasive species\"...in this case, the renegade buckthorn in the back of Mrs. Samson's property. \"I...you...how...I mean...\"\"We are trees,\" it said back to me without hesitation. \"Did you know that our roots run as long underground as we are high in the air?\" \"I've heard that,\" I said back.\"Do you not think that there is a contiguous root structure between here and your home?\" I thought about it a minute. So, it was the underground root network that gave the tree its information. But surely there must be some place, some open cornfield, some massive city, say, Cleveland, where the root system of trees is broken. \"We work around it,\" it said, reading my mind. \"We are trees.\" Realizing I could not knowingly argue against this, I started to plead my case. \"But it was an invasive,\" I said back to it with great persuasiveness. \"They're taking everything over. If we don't do something, the whole landscape will be changed. Good trees such as yourself will have no place to prosper.\" To this, I heard laughter. Not just the laughter of one jocular spruce tree out the cabin door. It was the collective hearty laughter of a thousand spruce trees, all my so-called \"brethren monks\" of this Sangha \u2014 or spiritual community \u2014 who rest upon this sacred land. The laugh was almost powerful enough to hurt my ears. \"You are the funniest human we know,\" the tree said to me finally, as the laughter died down. \"I am the only human you know,\" I asserted back, feeling rather rebuffed. Listening to the Wisdom of Trees This morning, in the middle of a wind-driven rain, I once again heard the voice of the great spruce tree...Always in the past when it's wanted to converse, it simply announces itself by saying rather abruptly, \" We are trees .\" It used to be Highway 17, but now it's Interstate 86, interestingly enough. 86, as in, they totally eighty-six-ed whatever wilderness had been here before.\"Why have you been ignoring trees?\"\"And, as seems to be the bewildering human propensity, you still have not answered the question. So, we will ask it a fourth time. Why do you ignore trees?\" I sat there on the love seat a while, trying to think it all through. Somehow, through the underground tree root network, or some such thing, communication is passed along through intertwining tree roots that are strung along for hundreds, maybe thousands of miles. So, one tree tells another tells another tells another, and suddenly, I'm busted. I'm the dude who \"ignores trees.\" Okay...I admit it. On the day I cut down Mrs. Samson's rather large invasive buckthorn, I went in rather crudely. I brought my chainsaw \u2014 the so-called \"thousand toothed monster,\" as the tree has called it \u2014 and I kind of brazenly slashed the thing to the ground. It was, like, a hundred and fifty degrees outside. And buckthorns, as those of you who have dealt with them before know, are not the friendliest of species. Large thorns poke out from most of their branches, and if you're not wearing layers of clothing and protective gear, you're gonna get poked and prodded and bloodied, like real fast. It was way too hot out to wear much clothing at all, let alone a bunch of protective gear. And I'd been poked and bloodied and scratched by this tree more times than I care to recount. I cut the damned thing up, loaded the brush into my pick-up truck, dumped it at the compost center, and took the big round trunk pieces home for our woodstove. At the end of the day, Mrs. Samson handed me a check for my time. Still, I knew suddenly \"of that which the tree speaketh.\" I was busted, and there was no way around it. It was time to fess up and answer its question. Why do I ignore trees? I mean, out here I don't. Out here, on my yearly retreat, they are the most sacred thing around. I walk slowly across the property, palm to palm to show my reverence for them all. I stop and look closely at their trunks...magnificent works of art too beautiful for words. Large swirls and crevasses and indentations, cracks, fissures, and flakes all woven together seamlessly, dotted with lush green moss, hues glowing red to brown to gray against speckled, filtered sunlight, turning and undulating. Swollen knots, incisions made by pesky pileated woodpeckers, a drizzle of orange-yellow sap too frozen to fall to the ground. I come out here and I'm blown away by the intricacy of it all. I stand there staring, five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes, at a single tree trunk, thinking to myself, what a work of art...this one little tree, one of millions. Who had the time to do all this? I ponder...and I just stand back and let the awe run through me like some kind of lost life blood and wonder why the other 355 days of the year I can whack down a buckthorn tree and not feel a thing. Was that invasive buckthorn not every bit as beautiful? \"I ignore trees,\" I said, stammering for an honest answer, \"because...I am not much better off than the very humans I claim are the reason I come to this place in search of solitude each year! Why I cannot hold onto the flowing sacredness I feel while I am here, I cannot say.\" After mulling it over a while, it finally said back with great dispassion, \"You can cut down trees. This is not the issue. Cut down trees to your heart's content. But can you not feel a tiny bit of awe while you are doing so?\" \"I...I suppose I could.\" \"Trees will come and trees will go. All things are like that. I will come and go. You will come and go. That's just the nature of all things, is it not?\" \"Yes, I suppose it is.\" \"So, then, whether a tree is cut down or is blown down or is pecked to death by a bird or rots from the inside of old age is not really the issue, is it?\" \"I guess not.\" \"You think I am upset because you cut down a tree? Ha! I am upset because...because we are trees! Here at your cabin, there at your home. There is only one tree. We are the same. You think we can only understand you here, in this tiny outpost? Out there, we are deaf, dumb, and mute? You happened upon the one and only intelligible, audible tree in all the land? Cut the tree down, by all means. But talk to it before you do so. It knows and can understand and would gladly give you its life just to hear you acknowledge its presence. That's all that we ask. We are trees.\" With that, the conversation ended. I put down the paper and pen and sat there all dejected. What a dichotomy my life has become ever since I started coming out to this place. How hard it was for me to transfer any little bit of it at home whatsoever. I have the intention of bringing it all back home with me and living in this mindfully harmonious way, each and every time I come out here. Then...I don't know. Jobs must be done. Bills must be paid. There's mold in our upstairs bedroom and it must be dealt with. A high school kid backs into my pick-up truck and I'm knee deep in insurance claims and paperwork. All kinds of crap come up, and somehow the perspective is lost. I didn't mean not to care when I cut down that tree; it's just that life has this way of encroaching, each and every time. Will I ever get this thing right? I thought to myself, sitting there. I was in the midst of a major browbeating, and a damned good one at that, when suddenly, out of nowhere, I heard the tree one more time. \"We are trees,\" it said to me with utmost sympathy. \"Now get out here and give me a hug.\" And I did. ### Lenny Bass is a long time meditation practitioner with deep ties to the Zen Buddhist Temple of Ann Arbor.

What's New Local birth doula and herbalist Caryn Simon has started a new business with a unique service for pregnant women: Tidy Nest Prenatal Organization. Simon explained that she was inspired to start the business while helping her sister-in-law prepare her home for her newborn. She realized that as a birth doula and a person who loves to put things in order, she could help expecting mothers in what can be a very stressful time. \"I love organizing,\" Simon explained. \"I like getting rid of things; it helps me not to feel overwhelmed, like the load is lighter \u2014 it's healing for me in that way, and helping others do it feels good.\" Preparing a home for a newborn, said Simon, generally involves \"a huge to-do list,\" and right at a time when a woman's \"body and mind need rest and simplification.\" She also explained that the process of going through one's belongings in any circumstance can be \"really emotional,\" and even more so for pregnant moms. Simon can help with traditional organization services, such as clutter reduction and simplification of the living space, and her experience as a birth doula gives her the knowledge to assist with baby-specific tasks as well, such as putting together a gift registry and assembling cribs, strollers, and other items. Many expectant moms are given hand-me-down clothing or other items from relatives and friends, and these items need to be sorted, washed, and some donated \u2014 Simon can help with this potentially overwhelming task, too. She can also provide guidance in prioritizing to-do lists and creating postpartum support systems by connecting women to resources in the community. With over ten years of experience as a birth doula, Simon can also serve as a supportive listener and help answer a variety of questions expectant mothers may have.Simon will be offering her doula clients the new organization services as part of a package if they choose, but she explained that Tidy Nest is a stand-alone service that she can offer independently of her doula services. More information about Tidy Nest Prenatal Organization is online at www. carynascreatrix.com. Caryn Simon can be reached at (734) 646-1351 or artemisia418@gmail.com. Dr. Siiri Krygowski, an experienced chiropractor at the Lifeforce Wellness Centre in Ypsilanti, became certified in animal chiropractic care through the Animal Chiropractic Education Source (ACES) in Celina, Texas, in August of 2013, and is now offering chiropractic services for dogs and cats. Getting the certification was a natural choice \u2014 in addition to her years of experience as a chiropractor, she has also worked with animals for much of her life, having once worked as a veterinary technician and also run a pet sitting business. New Offerings by Established Businesses and Practitioners Caryn SimonLocal birth doula and herbalist Caryn Simon has started a new business: Tidy Nest Prenatal Organization. With a knack for organization and over 10 years of experience as a doula, Simon helps expecting mothers prepare their homes for a newborn in a variety of ways. In February of 2014, Dr. Amy Saunders opened Integrative Healthcare Providers, a new holistic health care clinic made up of a team of practitioners working together to \"provide patient- centered care in a healing environment. \" (See article page 16) Local business owner Anthony Nitsos of Ascendeus launched the Ann Arbor Holistic Chamber of Commerce in May of 2014 and serves as the chapter president. (See article page 16)The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 13 Continued on page 14The goal of chiropractic care for animals is the same as it is for humans, explained Dr. Krygowski, \"to promote 100 percent function of the central nervous system.\" The biggest difference, of course, is that cats and dogs are quadrupeds, making their movement compensations somewhat less predictable than humans. Dogs and cats, she explained, are athletes as much as any human, and they get subluxations, muscle spasms, and imbalances just as humans do. She explained that a subluxation is a misalignment of a joint, with a decrease in the normal range of motion. This can create problems as other parts of the body try to compensate. \"Disease is a process,\" explained Dr. Krygowski. \"Pain is one of the last things that happens, and degenerative processes can take years.\" This is why she encourages people to get chiropractic evaluations for themselves and their pets, whether pain is present at the moment or not \u2014 the chiropractor can detect problems that may cause pain or movement problems down the road, and adjustment can help prevent this. \"Two common things that contribute to subluxations include long toenails in dogs and cats, as they change the animals' posture, and the use of computers and cell phones in humans. We are seeing a rise in cervical disc herniation and headaches in young adults from constantly looking down to use phones and iPads,\" she said. (No overuse of cell phones and computers by animals has been reported, as of yet.) Dr. Krygowski explained that pet owners might seek chiropractic care for their pets if they notice any changes in movement or behavior. Most people attribute this to general aging and assume nothing can be done, but chiropractic care can help animals move and feel better. A longtime horse owner, Dr. Krygowski adjusts her own horse and also offers barn calls as a part of her services. She said that horses can take on their riders' imbalances \u2014 if a rider has a high left hip, for example, the horse is likely to as well. For this reason she enjoys being able to work with both the horse and rider. People seeking care for themselves or their dogs and cats can call the Lifeforce Wellness Centre at (734) 434-9835 or visit lifeforcewellnesscentre.com. The Centre is located at 2302 Packard Road, Ypsilanti, Michigan 48197. Dr. Krygowski can be reached via email at drsiiri@lifeforcewellnesscentre.com. Personal and professional coach Donna Ryen became certified in the Havening Technique in February of 2014 and is using this modality to help her clients overcome trauma and make room for new thought and behavior patterns. The Havening Technique was developed by Dr. Ronald Ruden, and it is described in his book When the Past Is Always Present. Also called Amygdala Depotentiation Therapy (ADT), Havening uses four basic \"strokes\" \u2014 touches \u2014 on the face and arms, which, Ryen explained, generate delta waves in the brain. The technique can be applied by a trained professional, or can be taught and self-applied. It is in a category of \"psychosensory therapies,\" which use sensory input to alter thought and behavior. According to Dr. Ruden, \"When an event or experience is perceived as traumatic or very stressful, it becomes immutably encoded, often with life-altering consequences. However, recent research from the field of neuroscience has shown us how it's possible to modify this encoding. The Havening Techniques are methods that are designed to change the brain to de-traumatize the memory and permanently remove its negative effects from both our psyche and body.\" Ryen explained that the Havening Technique works quickly. As an extreme example, she cited working with a woman who had been in therapy for over 30 years for a traumatic event that happened in her childhood. After two Havening sessions she felt healed of the trauma. \"We are not going to talk about it forever \u2014 we are going to de-link the trauma and fear in the brain,\" Ryen said, and many people can experience great relief from PTSD, grief, trauma, or long-term stress in just one session. Ryen offers coaching in person and over Skype (teaching clients to self-apply the Havening Touch). She will also offer introductory workshops on the Havening Technique at the Crazy Wisdom Community Room on February 5 and March 5. Donna Ryen can be reached at DonnaRyen@aol.com or (734) 417-3884.

She has been training in the program since March of 2014 and expects to become certified in it soon. She explained that benefits include \"gaining freedom from fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of the unknown, and fear of overwhelm\" and \"transforming longstanding issues, problems, and challenges from struggle into something that's peaceful.\" Catey does all of her coaching via phone or Skype, and has helped many clients to transform their relationship with money from one of conflicted emotions to one of peace and prosperity. She loves working with women around issues involving money, and explained that women get mixed messages, that men don't, about making money. On one hand, they are told to go to college, get a good job, and make money while, on the other, society often suggests they need a man to provide for them. This can result in problem-causing habits and mixed feelings about money. Catey has been a Certified Money Breakthrough Coach since 2012 and feels the Harmony Integration process can add to what she offers her clients. \"It helps people dissolve the emotional component of blocks in a permanent way,\" she said, and it works very quickly. \"They don't have to explain their story; they just have to be willing to fully feel whatever feelings [the Harmony Integration] brings up. We don't have to keep talking about lifelong issues over and over again \u2014 we just release them.\" Afterward, she explained, people can clearly \"see what steps they have to take and have the emotional freedom to do it.\" Catey offers a complimentary 30-minute \"empowered and at peace with money\" coaching session for people interested in working with her, to explore whether her coaching would be a good fit for them. Pamela Catey can be reached at (734) 531-9121 or pamela@ownitandgrowit.com. More information about her coaching services is online at www.OwnItandGrowIt.com, and more about the Harmony Integration program is available at www. HarmonyIntegrationAcademy.com. Local spiritual teacher, intuitive, and author Marybeth Nelson published her fourth book in October of last year: Paths to Your Soul-Self . Described as a self-help book on how to develop intuition by listening to your soul, Nelson explained that it was inspired in part by a near-death experience she had during a surgery. She described the experience as \"peaceful and beautiful,\" and said she saw a \"pure, bright white light that was pure joy, love, and peace.\" Afterward, she felt a great comfort and surety that loved ones who had died had experienced this same peace, and that \"we won't die; we just continue on in a different form.\" At different times in our lives, Nelson said, we tend to ponder why we are here \u2014 what our purpose and path in this life is or should be. This book speaks to people in different steps of life who are in that position, as well as to people who are grieving. She said that the book discusses steps you can take to \"know that your soul is on the right journey in this lifetime.\" Paths to Your Soul-Self as well as two of Nelson's earlier books are available at Crazy Wisdom. Nelson gives readings, Reiki sessions, and seminars on developing intuition and will be offering readings at Crazy Wisdom in 2015. Watch the events page on her website for dates and times as they are scheduled. Marybeth Nelson maintains a website at www.spiritualintuitivemb.com.

Nonprofit Enterprise at Work (NEW) and ZingTrain (Zingermans' training business) have teamed up, with the help of a $15,000 grant from the Ann Arbor Area Community Foundation, to offer the Leadership DELI - Develop, Elevate, Launch, Innovate: a 7-month series of training seminars for nonprofit organizations in the community. Fifteen nonprofits were chosen from a pool of applicants, and each nonprofit had the ability to bring two people from its organization to the training. Rosemary Linares of NEW explained that the program is intended to target current and upcoming leaders in area nonprofits to assist them in learning \"best practices\" -- practices as delineated by ZingTrain and NEW. Beginning in October of 2014, the group has been meeting monthly for a total of seven four-hour seminars, with follow-up virtual sessions held two weeks later. Linares said that this is a pilot program that NEW and ZingTrain hope to replicate in different locations in the future. The series began with \"The Art of Giving Great Service,\" which details Zingermans' systems and philosophy for treating customers (and volunteers) \"like royalty.\" Session two \u2014 \"Leading with Zing!\" \u2014 covered Zingermans' successful leadership and management practices. Other seminars will include \"Creating a Culture of Inclusion,\" \"Selling and Marketing Your Mission,\" \"Open Book Management,\" \"Lean\" (Zingermans' concept of generating more value while reducing waste), and \"Creating a Vision of Greatness.\" Nonprofits chosen to participate span a variety of missions, from housing assistance and addiction recovery to community action and nature conservation. The following organizations are involved: The Ann Arbor Film Festival, Avalon Housing, Cancer Support Community of Greater Ann Arbor, Community Action Network, Dawn Farm, Ecology Center, Habitat for Humanity of Huron Valley, Huron River Watershed Council, Leslie Science and Nature Center, the Neutral Zone, Ozone House, Slow Food Huron Valley, the Corner Health Center, the Dispute Resolution Center, and Ypsilanti Meals on Wheels.

Beginning Monday, January 12, art therapist Sibel Ozer is offering a new four-week \"Expressive Arts Group for Professional Women\" at the Women's Center of Southeast Michigan on Maple Road in Ann Arbor. The group will meet weekly to \"play with paint,\" and each person will work with one canvas for the entire month, allowing the canvas to evolve as the weeks go by. Ozer said the group is targeted toward high-functioning women who have a lot going on in their lives, and who may not have taken the time recently to attend to themselves and reflect on changes occurring within them. The activity can be \"as playful or deep\" as any of the participants make it, \"or whatever it needs to be.\" The emphasis is not on sharing the artwork, but on \"a collective sharing of mindfulness\" and self-care, she said. The arts group is limited to eight participants, and of the $160 cost, $80 is a tax- deductible donation to the Women's Center, which provides counseling, support services, job coaching, and other services at affordable fees. Ozer explained that Ann Arbor-based life and business coach P amela Catey, who primarily focuses on helping women business owners, received training in the Harmony Integration method and is now incorporating this healing technique into a new program called \"End Struggle Now. \" New Books by Area Authors In October of last year, local spiritual teacher, intuitive, and author Marybeth Nelson published her fourth book: P aths to Y our Soul-Self.

Certified Hatha yoga instructor and registered nurse Janine Polley recently became certified as a yoga therapist and was also accredited by the State of Michigan to offer continuing education credits for RN attendees at her health-centered workshops: \"Yoga for the Prevention and Treatment of Headaches,\" for Chronic Pain Relief,\" Osteopenia and Osteoporosis.\" \"As an RN of over 30 years, I wish I had known when I began as a nurse about the healing grace of the ancient yoga breathing and subtle movements. So I am particularly thrilled to be able to teach other nurses how we can assist patients in pain management and other health-related challenges right at the bedside and/or in outpatient settings with the focused breath and gentle, heart opening movements of Hatha yoga,\" Polley explained. \"Yoga for the Prevention and Treatment of Headaches\" will be offered on February 7 from 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. at Inward Bound Yoga at the Friends Meeting Center on Hill Street and is limited to eight participants so that each can get personalized attention. The cost is $25, and the class is open to all; though RNs can get continuing education credits, anyone can attend. Since Polley's daughter is expecting a baby in the spring, she is waiting to schedule more of the workshops, but interested people can watch the Inward Bound Yoga webpage for more dates as they become available. Inward Bound Yoga is online at http://ibyoga.org. To register for the February workshop or to find out more, contact Janine Polley at (313) 909-8006 or janinedpolley@gmail.com. Local business owner Anthony Nitsos of Ascendeus launched the Ann Arbor Holistic Chamber of Commerce in May of 2014 and serves as the chapter president. The Holistic Chamber of Commerce (HCC) is an international organization supporting \"excellence in holistic, complementary, alternative, and sustainable professionals, practitioners, and businesses.\" Nitsos explained that members of the local chapter comprise a wide range of professionals: attorneys, chiropractors, marketers, accountants, Reiki practitioners, and more. He said that members don't have to be from a holistic business in order to fit in and benefit from membership in the HCC. Rather, they should be invested in the idea of holism in their lives and business practices \u2014 considering \"mind, body, spirit, business, budget, planet\" in their culture and operations. Nitsos compared a company to a body, and said that holism is like digging deep for the root cause of problems instead of just treating symptoms \u2014 \"promoting health instead of just treating illness.\" If a company cultivates a happy work environment, the workforce calls off sick less, steals less, makes fewer mistakes and is more productive. A company exists in order to make a profit, Nitsos said, but holism considers the best way to do that while also honoring the employees, the customers, and the planet. \"This is not just the right thing to do,\" he explained, \"it's a business strategy that will result in a better bottom line.\" Nitsos found out about the international Holistic Chamber of Commerce organization in the beginning of 2014 and was surprised to learn that Ann Arbor did not yet have a local chapter. In his own business, he said, \"I'd been using holistic strategies for years without calling it that.\" A yoga instructor at Russa Yoga in his spare time, he was also very aware of the benefits of taking care of oneself instead of sacrificing health and happiness for perceived business success, which is another aspect of business holism: \"If you're not taking care of yourself, how can you take care of your people and your business?\" Seeing the great potential for an Ann Arbor chapter of the HCC, Nitsos began the process of forming it. It began with 20 members immediately following the May launch and grew to over 40 members by November. Nitsos said he hopes to have 100 members by the chapter's one-year anniversary. Ann Arbor's HCC meets on the second Wednesday of most months. Each meeting features a keynote speaker who presents on topics related to improving their businesses \u2014 \"no boring speakers,\" Nitsos promised. In order to join the Chamber, applicants must submit references who can vouch for their character and the quality of their work. Once accepted, the member is added to the online directory and can attend events held by other local chapters as well as his or her own \u2014 Michigan has chapters in Brighton, Oakland County, Kalamazoo, Lansing, and Macomb County. Many members offer discounts to other members. Nitsos named other benefits of membership as being part of a community of like-minded people working toward a better future and helping to create a new culture of business practices rooted in holism and treating people and the planet as just as important as clients and vendors. More information about Ann Arbor's Holistic Chamber of Commerce is available at www.holisticchamberofcommerce.com/mi-ann-arbor. Anthony Nitsos can be reached at (734) 707-7755 or at AnnArbor@HolisticChamberOfCommerce.com. Integrative Healthcare Providers opened in February of 2014. It is a new holistic health care clinic owned by Dr. Amy Saunders, who has assembled a team of practitioners working together with the common goal of \"providing patient- centered care in a healing environment.\" {Dr. Saunders was profiled in the January thru April 2013 issue of the Crazy Wisdom Community Journal (Issue #53, starting on page 39) which is available on our archive at crazywisdomjournal.com.} A general internist, Dr. Saunders left the University of Michigan and began working to build her holistic family practice in 2012, beginning at the Natural Balance Wellness Medical Center, where she worked for two years. Seeking more space to grow her practice and envisioning a team of providers working collaboratively in one space, she began reaching out to other practitioners to see if there was interest in forming a new clinic. As it turned out, it was the right time and the right plan for several of those practitioners. Jennifer Wolf, an experienced nurse who was just completing her post-graduate degree as a nurse practitioner in 2013, was the first to commit to joining the clinic and helped Dr. Saunders design it. Wolf now provides primary care and wound care. Dr. Amanda Kaufman, another former doctor at U-M, found a good fit at IHP , where she now practices holistic family medicine. (Dr. Kaufman is quoted extensively in our article in this issue, on page 54 , called \"Expanding the Scope of Practice,\" about her work in training U-M medical students to have a deeper understanding of complementary and alternative medicine.) Two administrative assistants \u2014 Jessica Ferrel and Valerie Grieve helped get the clinic set up and have been with Dr. Saunders since its opening. Three other practitioners make up the rest of the team. Robert Piper is a clinical social worker who provides individual counseling using several modalities including mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, and hypnosis. Dr. Diana Quinn is a board-certified naturopathic doctor who specializes in women's health, endocrinology, Certified Hatha yoga instructor and registered nurse Janine P olley recently became certified as a yoga therapist, and was also accredited by the State of Michigan to offer continuing education credits for RN attendees at her health- centered workshops.

She helps patients with several modalities including nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathy, and mind-body therapies. Abby Humphrey uses her expertise in acupuncture and Chinese medicine to help patients with a variety of issues. Dr. Saunders explained that each practitioner has an independent practice, but that the team meets frequently to discuss issues related to the clinic and patient care. Patients who would benefit from the services of more than one practitioner are referred, \"but not in a pressured way,\" she said. While the clinic is new, each practitioner has at least 9 years of clinical experience in their respective fields, and several have more than 20.

Massage therapist Monica Boch opened Pearl Yoga & Massage in downtown Ypsilanti in September of last year. The studio offers massage therapy and yoga classes in a large space with exposed brick walls and art pieces that change monthly for Ypsilanti's Art Walks. Eventually, Boch said, she would like to offer a variety of health and wellness classes in the space as well. Boch has studied massage therapy since 2002 and began pursuing it professionally in 2010. She works in Swedish style with the influence of Eastern modalities and especially enjoys working with clients experiencing chronic pain, fascia restrictions, and neuropathy. Her technique, she explained, is customized for the needs of each client. Boch is also working toward certification as a Hatha yoga instructor through Sun Moon Yoga's instructor training program. Five other yoga instructors offer classes in Hatha, Vinyasa, Ashtanga, and Yin styles of yoga. The studio's class capacity is 15 students, so instructors are able to provide personal attention to each student. Boch funded the opening of the studio herself, and said that she felt a great need to bring the type of creative health and wellness space found so frequently in Ann Arbor to Ypsilanti. She hopes to continue to offer diverse classes and services, and said she recently announced an energy medicine workshop, and it was filled within four days of the announcement. Boch explained that her business model is responsive and adaptable to what local people are interested in doing. \"We are a studio welcoming to students at all levels of experience,\" she said, and explained that the instructors are very knowledgeable and able to work with people on an individual basis to help deepen their yoga practice. She described the business as a \"community studio\" and said that both instructors and students are growing and learning in the process. \"You don't have to have the right outfit,\" she joked, emphasizing a welcoming, playful, non-judgmental atmosphere. Pearl Yoga & Massage is online at www.pearlofypsilanti.com and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/pearl.yoga.massage/info. It is located at 108 Pearl Street, Ypsilanti, Michigan 48197.

McCarty recently relocated to Ann Arbor from New York, where she earned her master's degree in Traditional Oriental Medicine (after completing her clinical work at Pacific College of Oriental Medicine). She specializes in fertility, pregnancy, and delivery, as well as general wellness treatments. She also has experience in pediatrics and has worked on her own two young children. Common Source provides community acupuncture, which, McCarty explained, is a national movement. Instead of treating one person in a private room, the acupuncturist works on up to six people simultaneously (with screens set up for partial privacy). Patients benefit from \"cumulative healing energy,\" which she described as \"a sensation that is often discounted until you get the chance to experience a treatment in the vicinity of a few other people whose bodies are likewise working themselves back into balance.\" Group treatment also makes it possible for treatments to be offered at a much lower cost, making acupuncture accessible for more people who could benefit. Since healing can take several visits, explained McCarty, \"lowered costs mean that patients have a little bit more opportunity to disassociate money issues from health \u2014 something that is far too rare.\" McCarty also offers expertise in facial acupuncture, herbal medicine, practical nutrition, and skeletal-muscular healing. She is available for on-call labor and delivery support as well; she attended her first Michigan homebirth in October to help turn a malpositioned baby, which she said was accomplished by placing a needle in a particular spot on the mother's little toe, and it worked very smoothly. Another remarkable success story involved helping a woman who had been trying for five years to get pregnant \u2014 the woman was finally able to conceive shortly after receiving acupuncture treatments. McCarty said she often sees patients who come in barely able to move due to back or shoulder pain and leave after their first treatment feeling significant relief and restored function. More information about Nicole McCarty and Common Source Acupuncture is available at www.commonsourcehealing.com. She can be reached by phone at (734) 926-9410 or email at commonsourcehealing@gmail.com. Common Source is located at 220 N. 5 th Avenue, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104 (on the second floor). Janette Ghedotte, clinical psychologist and certified trainer in the Body Language Institute's \"You Can't Lie To Me\" Program, started Accurate Body Language, LLC, in 2013. Offering classes, workshops, and one-on-one coaching, Ghedotte helps people understand and use body language in order to detect deception and to assist in interpersonal relationships, sales, job interviews, law enforcement, parenting, and any other human (and even animal) interactions. \"Babies are body language experts,\" explained Ghedotte. \"Body language is our first language and we discount it as we learn verbal language.\" She helps people to once again become attuned to this type of communication. As an example, she talked about \"hot spots\" \u2014 indicators of discomfort such as increased blink rate, hard swallows, eye rolling, and turning the feet away from someone. A teenager exhibiting some of these \"hot spots\" may not be being honest with his parent about where he has been. A salesperson noticing these signs in a potential customer would do well to further explain the product or find out more about the client's needs instead of asking for the sale right away. Ghedotte said that she became focused on teaching others about body language when she watched the presidential debates with the sound turned off, and noticed that the candidates were saying a lot with their bodies that most viewers would miss. In early 2015, Ghedotte is presenting at several events, which will be open to the public. Details will soon be available on her Facebook page. On January 20, she will present an Accurate Body Language Keynote Presentation for the National Association of Women Business Owners. On a date to be announced in February, she will work with Footnotes Dance Studio in Ann Arbor to speak on \"How to Move Like a Leader with Top 10 Professional Dancer and Accurate Body Language Secrets.\"On March 7, she will present with Michael Burkey, dog behavior expert and owner of Michigan Dog Training, LLC, on \"How to Decode and Detect Deception in Human Body Language \" and \"Ho w to Decode and Train Dogs w/ Body Language!\" On March 15, she will team up with doctors Bob and Charlene Levine of Corporate Wellness Resources in Southfield to present \"You Can't Lie to Me: A 5-Step Process of Getting to the Truth.\"This past September, massage therapist Monica Boch opened P earl Y oga & Massage in downtown Ypsilanti.

Dr. Marcy Epstein, in addition to teaching in the Comprehensive Studies Program at the University of Michigan, opened Ann Arbor Educational Associates (AAEA) at the end of 2012. By background, Dr. Epstein is a professor of English and literacy/language arts, with post-doctoral specialization in disability and rehabilitative psychology. She created her practice to meet a growing need for \"complex literacy:\" a comprehensive, humane approach to reading, writing, speaking, and engaging in academic and professional environments. AAEA clients are diverse and tend to have more than one issue of literacy and learning at work or school (or in play); examples include children who may be gifted in one area and impaired in another, traumatized learners, students on Spectrum or with cognitive disability, English Language Learners (ELL) and international scholars, writers with blocks or mental illness, and professors undertaking a difficult tenure process. Dr. Epstein has helped children who struggle to keep up in their language classes at school, as well as gifted children who are not challenged at school and need more advanced projects and personal choice in what to explore to stay engaged in the learning process. She serves as an educational advocate, a specialized tutor, and a coach to help these students learn to navigate and enjoy working with language. She explained that she especially enjoys working with children with any kind of \"outsider experience\" \u2014 giftedness, ELL, any type of disability including autism or Asperger's, LGBT youth, or those with a difficult family background \u2014 and helping those children regain confidence and \"find a place.\" Dr. Epstein has also assisted adults in writing for academia, for the internet, for theater, and for personal enjoyment and enrichment. She emphasizes that with each individual, she joins them on their journey of learning and exploring as a warm and supportive guide. Dr. Epstein works with institutions as well as individuals, consulting on issues of social justice and educational access, focusing, she said, on \"individualizing education without stigma, through specialized tutorial, assessment, advocacy, and retraining.\" She seeks to work with institutions with some focus on social justice to help them \"strengthen their voices in a world that is sometimes hostile\" to their passion and ideas.

Semi-retired Ann Arbor resident and activist Nancy Ogilvie is forming a new consulting business offering workshops and group coaching for people interested in taking collective action to combat climate change and other dangers to our planet. \"Science says the situation is dire,\" said Ogilvie, and many people are scared and feel there is little they, as individuals, can do. \"Yet we have all the technology we need to turn the situation around; it's the human will that's missing.\" Her introductory workshops are geared toward giving people clarity about what the climate situation is, and providing sources of hope and options for taking action. Ogilvie is especially interested in talking to young grandparents \u2014 people who may be newly retired and looking for something meaningful to do with their time and who are invested in creating a better future for their grandchildren. According to Ogilvie, there are actions people can take as individuals and actions that need group effort to start making real progress in combating climate change. As an example of individual action, she suggests that one of the most impactful things we can do is to eat less meat. She explained that the agriculture industry releases a large amount of greenhouse gases into the air, and that eating less meat can be as beneficial to the environment as driving a hybrid car. For issues that will require more collaborative effort and organization, she mentioned working toward changes in policy, such as instituting a carbon tax and creating an amendment that would overturn Citizens United. Ogilvie will offer introductory workshops on \"Standing Together for the Earth's Future\" on January 8, February 24, March 14, and April 14. Locations and times will be announced on her website as they are finalized.

There she offers services in naturopathic medicine, massage therapy, energy medicine, and movement. Myers' journey in holistic medicine began after she underwent extensive surgery for cancer. At the eight-week post-operative appointment, she was still experiencing significant pain, lethargy, and a general feeling that her body had been invaded and was not healing right. Doctors had little to offer her, and she left with the impression that this was just how it would be to live in her body from now on. This launched her into a quest to find ways to heal. Before this experience, Myers knew nothing about natural medicine. Luckily, after the surgery, she found a naturopath who \"made my life worth living again.\" She also discovered Nia, a holistic fitness practice, which helped heal the scar tissue from the cancer. She said that, in some ways, she now moves better than she did before the surgery. \"I didn't know I could feel this good again.\" After her own healing journey, Myers felt inspired to learn how to help others; \"I knew this was my new life path and purpose,\" she said. She pursued education in everything that had been helpful to her and is now a traditional naturopathic doctor, a licensed massage therapist, Black Belt Nia instructor, Touch for Health practitioner, herbalist, and energy medicine practitioner. Myers' approach is holistic, addressing not only the physical body but also the spiritual, mental, and emotional aspects of the person seeking healing. She works with the person to develop a plan of self-care and healing services, and said that people are sometimes surprised, after getting the impression from Western medicine that there's not much that can be done for them, how simple (not necessarily easy) it can be to help oneself with nutrition, movement, and the right healing services. \"Living in a body should be joyful and pleasurable. Sometimes we just need a few suggestions, guidelines, or outside services to reset our body's innate ability to heal itself and restore itself to a sense of well-being,\" Myers said. Sole to Soul Healing Center & Spa is located at 325 E. Eisenhower Parkway, Suite 1, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48108. Teresa Myers can be reached at tkmyers@soulfulmovement.com or (734) 846-2695.

Mridu Pasrija, a Crystalline Consciousness T echnique (CCT) Energy Coach and Certified Teacher, offers a variety of healing and transformative sessions to help individuals recognize and connect with their personal power, wisdom, and joy. She also teaches webinar and in-person classes that give participants tools and techniques for facilitating personal growth, freedom, healing, and transformation. CCT is an energy healing technique that works to \"heal your past, transform your present, and manifest your future,\" Pasrija said. She found out about it in 2007, when her sister recommended she get a CCT healing session. \"The best part was, I felt as though I'd 'come home' \u2014 coming back to myself and my own power, joy, and wisdom. I shifted from watching my life from the sidelines to becoming an active participant based on what was really important to me. With the help of CCT, I realized that the answers to what I had been searching for were within me \u2014 such a simple realization that was life changing!\" Deciding that she wanted to use this tool to help others, Pasrija pursued education and certification and now provides CCT sessions and training. She explained, \"Everything in the universe is energy, from the smallest atoms to the largest galaxies. How we think and feel can direct energy in profound and powerful ways. When we work directly with the energy of something, we experience quick and amazing changes that we connect with at a deep level.\" Pasrija is offering the following webinars and in-person classes this winter and spring: CCT Level 1 \u2014 \"Awakening to Your Energetic Self,\" a webinar divided into two 90-minute sessions; offered on February 28, March 8, 25, and 26, and April 4, 2015. Pasrija explained that Level 1 is \"especially helpful for energetically sensitive people,\" and will give them a set of tools to tune into their own inner voice while shutting off distracting energy from others. CCT Level 2 \u2014 \"Activating Your Crystalline System,\" a multi-session webinar on April 22, 23, and 24, followed by in-person classes in Northville on May 2 and 3. Level 2 is for people who want to go more in-depth with CCT, learning the healing modality to help themselves and others. Pasrija also offers individual sessions in CCT, in-person or over the phone, as well as what she calls \"coffee shop sessions\" \u2014 where she meets with a client at a coffee shop to discuss what the client would like to shift in her life or what changes she is struggling with. At these sessions, Pasrija also creates a mandala infused with CCT energy, which the client can place somewhere she/he will often see it, to help support one's intentions. Pasrija lives in Northville, Michigan, and travels to India once a year to rejuvenate and reconnect with herself and her roots and to expand her spiritual knowledge.

Both women shared a similar itch to explore, and left their homes and families to move to different regions and experience life. Bad Fairy spent eight years in San Francisco before returning to Michigan. She said it was a great place to live at first, but after five years, she \"began to get tired of the concrete and the pace of life.\" Wonder Woman attended Xavier University in Cincinnati, and eventually moved to Chicago, where she worked at a nonprofit in HIV/AIDS education. She later was recruited to be an HIV/AIDS educator throughout Ohio and Michigan. While in Chicago, Wonder Woman also volunteered at an underground supper club. In 2008, Wonder Woman moved to Michigan for work, and she and Bad Fairy met through a mutual friend. After the two met, Wonder Woman convinced Bad Fairy that they should start an underground supper club of their own, which they called Bona Sera Supper Club. New to the Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti area, she thought it would be a good way to meet people. Through emails and Facebook announcements, the pair would announce their supper club and menu (but would not disclose the location for the event until two days prior), and people wishing to participate would have to purchase a ticket online for a suggested donation of 50 to 100 dollars. Wonder Woman and Bad Fairy would donate the proceeds from each event to a different charity. They also organized a themed drag show benefit for HIV/AIDS research every year. \"One year the theme was 'Fairytales Under the Sea,' and so the menu consisted of seafood dishes,\" Bad Fairy explained. \"Another year the theme was 'Hide the Salami,' which was a meat-based menu, and yet another year, we did a 'Cheap Tricks & Tricky Treats Halloween' theme with a drag show.\" Bona Sera Supper Club hosted events for five years, and in that time raised 20,000 dollars for various charities. \"We were never in it to make a profit,\" Wonder Woman said. \"It was just fun, and an interesting way to meet people.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 26 This is one in a series of articles we've been doing on local business owners and their businesses. What follows are profiles of two interesting businesses that are thriving despite the odds. By Mary RunserPhotos by Susan Ayer Enjoy a Bite to Eat at Bona Sera Caf\u00e9 Bona Sera Caf\u00e9 & http://eatypsi.com/bonaseraclub@gmail.com The two-woman team behind Bona Sera Caf\u00e9 consists of Bad Fairy and Wonder Woman, dynamic and fun-loving women who enjoy coming up with creative combinations and making great food for people. \"Cooking, for us, is a reflection of our own experiences in the world,\" Wonder Woman explained. \"Our food couplings and combinations are representative of the places we've traveled and experienced, and the foods we've tasted.\" The shrimp and grits is one such example. A customer favorite, it offers a flavorful taste of the South with just the right amount of seasoning. The crab macaroni and cheese, a yummy twist on a comfort food staple, also ranks at the top of the list for customer favorites. \"We really enjoy getting to create imaginative specials and introducing people to new food ideas,\" Wonder Woman said. The Bona Sera Underground Supper Club hosted events for five years, and in that time raised $20,000 for various charities.Bona Sera faced a bit of difficulty when it took much longer than expected to obtain a redevelopment liquor license. On a few occasions, they were able to serve alcohol because they are one of the host venues for \"Ypsilanti First Fridays.\" Both women noted that during these events business nearly tripled, so they knew obtaining a liquor license would be a key factor in attracting more business. Aside from their group of regular patrons, Bad Fairy said that getting new people to come in for dinner \"without the benefit of being able to order a beer or cocktail was a difficult feat.\" \"Traffic in downtown Ypsilanti is unpredictable at best,\" Bad Fairy added. Finally, Bona Sera Caf\u00e9 received its liquor license in September 2014, and new business is already coming in. Bad Fairy and Wonder Women enjoy the time they spend coming up with food couplings and creating new dishes. With the addition of the liquor license, they will now be able to suggest specific drinks to pair with each dish. Bad Fairy explained that they also have plans to put on more events, such as wine and beer tastings, music performances, and entertainment by local performers. \"Our goal is to be able to host a variety of events for the gay community, the artistic community, and the Ypsilanti community as a whole, by providing a nice space to gather for fun and good food.\" When man y of the supper club participants began to ask Wonder Woman and Bad Fairy to do catering, the pair had to start thinking about finding a new space. \"It was too difficult to do dinners for 100 people in my home kitchen, not to mention it was illegal because I was using an unlicensed kitchen,\" Wonder Woman said. So Wonder Woman and Bad Fairy started looking for a commercial kitchen to host their dinners and events. When they first started their search, it wasn't really their intent to open a full-fledged restaurant, but they crossed paths with the owners of MIX, a new and used clothing store located on Michigan Avenue in Ypsilanti. MIX initially had plans to open a caf\u00e9, market, and wine bar in the space across the street from its retail location (which is now where Bona Sera is located). \"That's how we ended up here,\" Bad Fairy explained. \"The owners of MIX eventually withdrew their deal on the space, and we stayed on as Bona Sera Caf\u00e9.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 27 Feature continued on page 28 Bona Sera Cafe C0-owner Annette \"Bad Fairy\" Weathers \"We really enjoy getting to create imaginative specials and introducing people to new food ideas.\"\u2014 Wonder Woman, Co-owner\"Our goal is to be able to host a variety of events for the gay community, the artistic community, and the Ypsilanti community as a whole, by providing a nice space to gather for fun and good food.\" \u2014 Ba d Fairy The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 28 Feature continued from page 27 Sic Transit Cycles Sic Transit Gloria Mundi: \"So Passes the Glory of the World\" Joe Bollinger and Michael Firn, owners Sic Transit Cycles Retail Showroom,1002 Pontiac Trail, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105(734) 327-6900; sictransitcycles.com Well-acquainted with the joys that riding a bike can bring, Michael Firn and Joe Bollinger are sharing their enthusiasm with the Ann Arbor community at their bike shop, Sic Transit Cycles. \"In its most elegant translation, sic transit gloria mundi means 'So passes the glory of the world,'\" Michael explained. \"Our name is a bit of a play on words in an attempt to relate the glory and beauty of the world passing as you're on your bike.\"Michael and Joe are not only spreading their enthusiasm for cycles but also serving the growing number of cyclists in Ann Arbor. This past April, Sic Transit opened its new retail space at 1002 Pontiac Trail. An \"urban focused shop specializing in functional transportation,\" its mission is to \"address the everyday cyclist who predominantly uses his or her bike for commuting, fitness, and riding for pleasure,\" Michael explained. He was also sure to mention another important aspect of their business: their service department. \"Our roots are as a repair shop and that aspect of our business will always be the cornerstone of what we do.\" And that's where the pair got their start \u2014 repairing and re-conditioning vintage and used bicycles. While Michael worked at the Arborland Borders, he expressed to his friend Joe an interest in biking to work because it took less time to bike across town than to ride the bus. Joe, who had been living in a shared house with a three-car garage (using one bay of which to work on bikes), purchased a 1980s steel-framed Schwinn for Michael and taught him a few things about bikes, like how to take the wheel off and change the tire. \"I learned to see the bike for more than just the sum of its parts. And I believe it was at that moment that my passion for vintage bikes was born,\" Michael said. Eventually, Michael purchased a Gitane bike on Craigslist for 40 dollars. He repaired and rebuilt it, and then sold it on eBay for 400 dollars! From that point on, Joe's garage remained chock-full of bikes waiting to be repaired, restored, and, hopefully, sold. In fact, it was the condition of the garage they'd been using that prompted them to look for a commercial space where they'd have the room to spread out and the chance to hone their skills. Sic Transit's mission is to \"address the everyday cyclist who predominantly uses his or her bike for commuting, fitness, and riding for pleasure.\" Michael Firn and Joe Bollinger The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 29 Sic Transit \"softly\" opened in the summer of 2009 in a space at 1033 Broadway. At that point, Michael and Joe had been collecting and rebuilding vintage bikes for ten years. \"Our intention was never to open a business but to locate a commercial space where we could continue our hobby,\" Michael said. But even though their intent during those first few months was not to become a retail or \"real\" business, they received a tremendous amount of support and interest from their neighbors. \"It was that support and interest that really encouraged us to turn what we were doing into something more regular and legitimate. It inspired us, so we decided to get a phone and hang a sign, and that sort of thing.\" Sic Transit remained a \"hobby business\" for about five years, while Michael and Joe worked full-time jobs outside of the cycling arena. Michael was a server at the Pacific Rim restaurant on West Liberty Avenue in downtown Ann Arbor. In 2010, he left Pacific Rim to work for Brooks England, the leather goods and bicycle saddle manufacturer. (He was based in Ann Arbor but spent a lot of his time traveling.) In 2013, he left Brooks England \"to pursue the idea of expanding and opening the shop.\" Joe also had a full-time position \u2014 in the energy trading department with Detroit Edison \u2014 but stepped away this past spring to devote more time to the newly expanded business. The two are now dedicating most of their time to running the business. (Because he likes to stay busy, Michael is again serving at the Pacific Rim after the shop closes in the evening.) Sic Transit now has three employees (five, if you include Michael and Joe) and will be adding two more staff members in 2015. They stock various styles and brands to meet all sorts of cycling needs, and carefully select accessory brands from around the world, taking pride in their unique selection. Though they've shifted their focus more to retail and transportation, they continue to \"re-condition and sell high-quality used and vintage bikes,\" Michael explained, \"though this now represents a much smaller part of our business.\" As an Ann Arborite, Michael is proud of his city and proud to own a business that has a significant impact on the way people are living their lives here in town. He likes being an ambassador for cycling and an informational resource, and having a welcoming space where people can feel comfortable about buying a bike again, or for the first time, or about just being a bike enthusiast. \"I consider a bike enthusiast to be someone who likes her bike and uses her bike,\" Michael said. \"It's a really exciting time to be in Ann Arbor right now. People are so environmentally conscious and striving to change the way they live their lives in order to preserve and restore the environment. So, as a bike store owner, it's about making people comfortable enough to ask questions and then getting them out there on their bikes.\" \"Our roots are as a repair shop and that aspect of our business will always be the cornerstone of what we do.\" \u2014 Michael Firn, co-owner \" As a bike store owner, it's about making people comfortable enough to ask questions and then getting them out there on their bikes.\" \u2014 Michael Firn Som aDance Class for Experienced Dancers Alternate Saturdays in 2015 4:30-6 pm Jan 10th & 24,Feb 14 & 28 March 14 & 28, April 11 May 9 & 30, June 13 Class meets at Arts in Motion Dance Studio 6175 Jackson Road Suite B A2 MI 48103 To register visit www.peopledancing.org click on Classes & Experiences.New!

As much as I loved studying tai chi, speaking with Joel has convinced me to begin practicing qigong. I have nothing to lose and all manner of health to gain. If you have any questions about Chinese medicine or qigong, please contact Joel Robbins at (734) 315-0573 or joelrobbinsherbalist@gmail.com. It takes a certain spirit to create something new, especially something new out of a somewhat rigid tradition. When Kendra Hurteau decided to make her own Petit Lenormand deck (called Under the Roses Lenormand), there were only two decks available on the market. Now there are quite a few, both self-published and available through publishers like U.S. Games Systems, Inc. At least five are designed by Kendra. You may be wondering, \"What is Lenormand? Is it like tarot?\" Yes and no. Kendra explains that Lenormand cards are more literal than tarot cards, which I personally find makes them easier to read. The Heart card symbolizes love, romance, emotions, and so on, and the Ship card stands for travel, exploration, transition, and so on. There are also only 36 cards rather than tarot's 78. Having purchased Under the Roses Lenormand myself last summer, I was very excited when Kendra agreed to sit down with me and talk about creating her own deck with her daughter, an extremely talented illustrator, Katrina Hill. \"Most people who self-publish don't use their own artwork,\" Kendra explained, so her partnership with Katrina really sets them apart. \"Everything starts with a story,\" said Kendra. In the case of Under the Roses Lenormand, things took off when Katrina was laid off from her job, and when the mother and daughter team decided to turn it into an opportunity to throw themselves into the creation process. Kendra came up with the ideas for the cards, then Katrina sketched them. The images have a late-Victorian/Edwardian look to them (which is what attracted me), and Kendra admits she enjoys that time period. Subsequent decks that the duo worked on together, Lenormand Silhouettes and Yuletide Lenormand, have the same theme. Using her Under the Roses Lenormand deck, Kendra gave me a sample reading to show me how a Lenormand reading works. She laid the cards out in what is called the \"petit tableau,\" using 18 cards. (The \"grand tableau\" requires all 36.) Rather than have a particular question in mind, I had her do a general reading, which means anything that's going on in my life can pop up. Right away Kendra saw that I want to move, but something is preventing me. This is true. She assured me that the outcome would ultimately be positive, but I would face some obstacles before then. Apart from my moving drama (found all over the tableau), the three cards at the bottom, which Kendra called the destiny cards, showed that I am meant to be a journaler (the card was the Journal), but my writing comes in cycles (the Moon card) and is sometimes obscured (the Clouds) and I can't get done all that I want to. Again, I was pegged.Exploring Chinese Medicine with Joel Robbins \"There are two pillars of Chinese medicine,\" explained local Chinese medicine practitioner Joel Robbins, \"acupuncture and herbalism.\" Recently, Joel was kind enough to meet with me at his office in downtown Ann Arbor (next to the Yellow Barn on Huron Street) and chat about what Chinese medicine is and how it can help us heal. The first pillar, acupuncture, which relies on the activation of certain points located around the body \u2014 generally via very thin needles \u2014 is good for outer body problems and getting the body's chi (energy flow or life force) flowing to where it needs to be to promote healing and wellness. When chi is not flowing as it should, illness can occur, so it is important to clear up blockages and keep everything swimming along as it should in order to feel our best. Moxibustion is another technique used to activate the same points as acupuncture and is perhaps a better solution for people who are squeamish about needles. I got to experience moxibustion first-hand \u2014 literally. Joel placed a small piece of moxa, specially dried mugwort, on an acupuncture point near the base of my left thumb. I have had problems with this hand ever since I injured it when I was nine years old and it did not heal properly. Using a delicious smelling Japanese incense stick, Joel lit the moxa, which then smoldered similarly to the incense. It did not hurt, and I was not burned. The best way I can describe it is a focused warmth that lingered even after the moxa was wiped away. For those individuals squeamish about both needles and burning, oils may also be used to warm the skin and draw the chi to that spot. The second pillar of Chinese medicine that Joel is very passionate about (his excitement shows in his charming smile) is herbalism, which seems to have a wider range than acupuncture. Herbalism is better for internal problems (clogged sinuses, for example) and disease. Joel grew up wild-harvesting with his family, who also used some folk remedies of Western herbalism alongside conventional Western medicine. This led him to study Western herbalism, then eventually the Chinese tradition. \"Chinese herbalism packs a powerful punch,\" Joel said, and can relieve symptoms in as little as a few days while acupuncture requires multiple treatments over time. Joel also teaches tai chi and qigong, which have their own health benefits in promoting personal energy for self-healing. I myself studied tai chi when I was younger and can attest to how much stronger and centered I felt when I was actively practicing. Joel points out that a lot of the health benefits people are seeking when they turn to tai chi (movement based on martial arts that is focused on proper alignment) are actually better achieved through qigong, a combination of movement, meditation, and breathing exercises, 1 2The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 30 Kendra came up with the ideas for the cards, then Katrina sketched them.

Getting Crafty with Kerstin Woodside Clever and chic Kerstin Woodside has been crafty her whole life. \"My Granny had me sewing since I was old enough to hold a needle,\" she said. Growing up, she made her own clothes, worked in mixed media and photography, and \"was even in a few art shows.\" It was during college when she fell in love with metalsmithing. Currently, Kerstin is launching her own jewelry business: Kamala Tree Designs. Right now, her pieces can be purchased from stores around Ann Arbor, like Orchid Lane and Catching Fireflies, but her dream is to one day open her own shop where she would also sell the work of other local artists and crafters. \"At that point all of the profits from Kamala Tree would go to a local charity. I saw Maya Angelou speak once, and one of the things she said that really stuck with me was 'when you get, give; when you learn, teach,' and I want to do that,\" Kerstin explained. Kerstin creates a lot of simple, earthy bracelets, necklaces, and earrings that make use of wooden beads, coral, and turquoise. She is part Cherokee through her grandmother and feels she is drawn to this combination of materials in particular because of her background. Many of the beads are sourced from trade shows and come from Nepal and Tibet. (She has not yet traveled to either place herself.) \"I also buy handmade items from other artists on Etsy. It is really important to me to support other local artists.\" One of the Kamala Tree bracelets that I have is mala-style and composed of dark wood beads and a sky-blue peace sign. The design alternatively comes with lotus beads or little Buddha faces in place of the peace sign. Other bracelets (and necklaces) incorporate the evil eye, an ancient symbol that spans many religions. \"I like using things that have additional meaning. Different Buddhas can 'bring about' different things, evil eyes are for protection, lotus symbolizes rebirth and purity.\"The name \"Kamala Tree\" comes from the Hindi goddess of wisdom, consciousness, and creation, Kamala. Kamala is one of the 10 aspects of the Divine Mother and is often shown seated or standing on a lotus and holding a lotus flower in each hand. It's hard to know Kerstin and not notice her affinity for elephants. She sometimes uses elephants in her jewelry designs, and they have clearly invaded her home. She laughs about it. \"My Granny had an elephant collection, and after she passed, they were given to me and I continue her collection.\" To many people, elephants are also considered symbols of good luck. (I am sensing a theme.) Outside of jewelry-making and her career as a retail manager, Kerstin loves spending time with her two wonderful (and also creative) daughters, going to the Arb, the farmers' market, and museums. She clearly knows how to make the most out of life, and this bright attitude shines in her beautiful creations. You can find Kerstin and her jewelry on her Etsy shop KamalaTree and follow her on Instagram under kerdy07.

Whether you're a seasoned yogi or getting ready to roll out your mat for the first time, you'll find a variety of tips from local yoga instructor, Roshani Adhikary . Namaste, Roshani, I recently stumbled upon your blog on the Crazy Wisdom Journal website. Congratulations on your pregnancy! I'm a mother of two, and it seems I can't lose the last few pounds of baby weight after having my second child. I've heard yoga is good for weight loss, but I'm a bit unsure, as it seems to be more of an exercise for the mind rather than the body. If it's true, it would be ideal for me since I don't have any time to go to a gym and have very limited space in my house for something like aerobics. I'm hoping you can help me from your own experience. Thanks in advance, Sheri G., Ann Arbor Dear Sheri, Kudos to you! Raising two kids certainly isn't easy; it's great that you're taking some time to prioritize your own health and wellness. Many women are shocked to find that their bodies simply are not the same post-pregnancy . It is true that the belly-area in particular seems to be the most stubborn after delivery . Fortunately , what you've heard is correct! Yoga is actually pretty great for weight loss, and it's also great for weight maintenance. If you don't have a lot of space or the ability to get to a gym, yoga is an excellent option. All you need is enough space for a mat, and the mental ability to block out any visual distractions (this is where closing your eyes becomes a huge help). There are many different styles of yoga, and some claim more benefits in regards to weight loss. From experience, I've found that a practice of more stagnant yoga (involving postures with long holds), such as Hatha yoga, is better for strengthening your muscles than it is for shedding excess fat. A practice with more fluidity and constant movement, such as Vinyasa yoga, tends to get the heart rate pumping thus leading to a more noticeable change in one's physique. Following some basic yogic guidelines helps increase one's discipline: stay hydrated throughout the day with lots of water, and try to practice yoga on an empty stomach (no food two hours prior to a session, and no food for one hour afterward). Decreasing mindless snacking will increase your chances at weight loss.If you're limited in space and travel, start by renting yoga DVDs from the library or the Internet and following along with them. Another option is doing several rounds of Sun Salutations. It may feel a little repetitive, but once you get into a flow , it can often feel like an active meditation session. Of course, it is always best to try to attend a class initially so you can consult with an actual teacher about your posture, but if this is not an option, just keep trying at home. In approximately 35 minutes you may be able to go through 30 rounds of Sun Salutations, and this, along with a proper diet, should help you achieve the physical results you desire, as well as some mental clarity . All the best! Roshani Namaste, Roshani! I'm so done with the cold! Last year I joined a heated yoga studio during the winter , but this year my funds are too low to repeat the same luxury. Please tell me there's a way I can incorporate yoga into my lifestyle to get myself warm this winter! I'm honestly considering moving from Michigan, but my entire family is here, so it's more of a pipe dream; I really need some sort of strategy to keep my body warm and my mind cool. Lori B., Ann ArborDear Lori, I think we Michiganders would get our residential cards revoked if we didn't consider moving during the winter at least once. It's true that hot yoga studios are wonderful to frequent during the wintertime but are also quite pricey at times. Luckily there are definitely some yoga-based solutions to warming up. In particular, there is a breathing technique you can practice at home:Named the \"Fire Breath\" or Agni-Prasana, this is a type of breathing you definitely want to do on an empty stomach. Sitting in a comfortable position, relax your entire face. Soften your jaw , neck, and shoulders. Inhale a long, deep inhalation through your nostrils. Feel your lungs expand until they can't expand any further, then exhale a short breath through the nostrils. As you exhale, simultaneously pull your navel inwards toward your spine. Repeat the short exhalation without taking any effort to inhale, as these inhalations occur naturally . Keep your face soft. Notice if you are scrunching your eyebrows. Take the time to relax. Imagine there is a mosquito flying into your nostrils and pretend you are exhaling through your nostrils in a manner that would shoo away the bug. Continue these short, quick exhalations about 25 times, and you should feel warmer in no time! Be mindful not to practice this breath if you are pregnant, have issues with your heart, or have high blood pressure. One another tactic is to listen to some guided meditations centered on winter themes. For example, visualizing a snowflake and immersing yourself in awe of the uniqueness of each and every snowflake. It's easy to feel frustrated with the cold, but it's just as easy to change our outlook by focusing on the wonder of the season. Good luck, Roshani Roshani Adhikary is a certified yoga instructor teaching in the Ann Arbor/Saline area. Visit crazywisdomjournal.com to send her your queries. To contact Roshani, email her at roshani734@gmail.com. Have a question for Roshani about your yoga practice? Submit it at crazywisdomjournal.com. Yoga is the study of balance, and balance is the aim of all living creatures: it is our home. ~Rolf GatesYOGA COLUMNThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 35 Ian Wylie realizes that nothing is truly perfect. But when he looks out his window and sees the beauty and peace of nature that surrounds him, he's tempted to think otherwise. \"It's so beautiful here, so pristine; for me, this is like a heaven on earth ... if you take it with a certain understanding that nothing on this plane of existence is perfect,\" he said. \"It's actually beautiful here in every season \u2014 and there's not too many places in Michigan where you can say that. It's so uplifting in a really nice, quiet way.\" Wylie lives on the property of Song of the Morning, a Yoga Retreat of Excellence, located on 800 lush acres of rolling countryside in Michigan's northern woodlands, near Vanderbilt. He's on the board of directors of Golden Lotus, Inc., the nonprofit group that owns and operates the retreat, which has been in existence for more than 40 years. \"People come here on different paths,\" Wylie said. \"We are a yoga retreat, but we don't just provide exercise for the body. We have people come here who are going through a tough time, and they just need to relax and let the answers come up. We have acres of trails to walk, we have a library. People don't have to participate in groups \u2014 they don't have to exercise, they don't have to meditate. It's encouraged, of course, but no one has to do anything.\" The History \"To seek happiness outside ourselves is like trying to lasso a cloud. Happiness is not a thing. It is a state of mind. It must be lived.\" \u2014 Paramhansa Yogananda A bright, sturdy sign at the entryway of the secluded retreat states \"Song of the Morning Ranch, A Yoga Retreat of Excellence,\" assuring visitors they've arrived at the center founded in 1970 by J. Oliver Black. The Detroit businessman was a disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda, one of the most renowned yoga masters of the twentieth century, author of Autobiography of a Yogi and How to Be Happy All the Time , among others. The retreat, said Wylie, was built by Black at Yogananda's request. Yogananda envisioned a center for the purpose of sharing the timeless science of yoga in all of its physical, mental, and spiritual applications as a full and practical way of life. \"He believes that it is possible for every human to come into contact with the divine,\" said Wylie. \"Inherently, everyone is divine \u2014 it's their true nature, and yoga is the muse by which this is actuated and experienced.\" Yogananda's mission, Wylie said, was to show the unity of all religions, with a particular emphasis on demonstrating that the original yoga, as taught by Krishna, and the original Christianity, taught by Jesus, shared the same beliefs. Yogananda spoke of creating World Brotherhood Colonies, communities where seekers of diverse spiritual traditions could live in harmony. Along those lines, Song of the Morning also features the Clear Light Community on the retreat property, where those who wish can lease homes long-term. Golden Lotus also has future plans for creating a Yoga University on the property, Wylie said.The Retreat Site \"The more you improve yourself, the more you will elevate others around you and the happier you will become. The happier you become, the happier will be the people around you.\" \u2014 Paramhansa Yogananda Lodging for guests at Song of the Morning is simple and comfortable, with accommodations boasting beautiful views of the Pigeon River Forest and/or river. A main lodge is used primarily for evening meditations and workshops, and also boasts a full kitchen available to guests. Many of the lodgings are located alongside the Pigeon River, which is being restored to its natural state after the removal of a dam. Prices range from around 35 dollars for a campsite per weekend night to 175 dollars per weekend night for the more luxurious Wheelhouse apartment with a queen bed, futon, full kitchen, and private bath. The most unique structures on the site are three geodesic domes, featuring skylights, small rooms, twin or bunk beds, and a sliding glass leading outside. The middle dome often is used for classes. The yoga programs taught on the site are based in Raja Yoga, which emphasizes balanced living and meditation. It includes: Ha tha yoga \u2014 asanas or postures and breathing techniques Bhak ti yoga \u2014 devotional practices, including prayer or devotional singing K arma yoga \u2014 selfless service Jnana y oga \u2014 path of wisdom through reading scriptures, introspection, and meditation A garden is tended by seasonal workers, who often stay for short periods of time in return for free room and board. They are invited to take part in regular hatha yoga classes, evening meditation, scheduled Sunday services, and the opportunity to grow spiritually. Vegetarian meals, often including bounty from the garden, are prepared for retreat guests during their stay. A Spiritual Heritage \"Live quietly in the moment and see the beauty of all before you. The future will take care of itself.\" \u2014 Paramhansa Yogananda Although yoga is core to the retreat, those with related interests often find themselves drawn to this secluded area. The retreat is open all year, with many coming for programs on wellness, meditation, relaxation, and more. They may stay for a week, a few days, or even just a few hours. \"We're pretty flexible,\" said Wylie, with a laugh. \"We've been around 44 years. And we'd like to be here a long, long time.\" The Blue Water Community of Mindful Living, based in Port Huron, has been finding its way to Song of the Morning for more than a decade, says retreat organizer Sam Ewalt. Members of Blue Water practice sitting and walking meditation in the tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh, the Vietnamese Buddhist teacher who emphasizes mindfulness in all aspects of life. \"It's a long haul for us to go there, but it's worth it,\" Ewalt said of the group's retreats. \"It's a very special place. It's 800 acres of woodland on a beautiful northwoods river, and it's very isolated. The place where we do our meditation is called the Wheelhouse, and it's built on the foundation of an old sawmill \u2014 there's glass on three sides, and it's really just like being out in nature. It's perfect.\"Ewalt says he's been out to the retreat by himself, as well as with the group. \"The food is good, the accommodations suit us, and the people there are just very, very warm and welcoming. There's a long legacy of spirituality there ... and you can feel it.\"By Diane Majeske Song of the Morning Yoga Retreat is located on 800 lush acres of rolling countryside in Michigan' s northern woodlands, near Vanderbilt. \"Inherently, everyone is divine \u2014 it' s their true nature, and yoga is the muse by which this is actuated and experienced.\" \u2014Ian Wylie Song of the Morning encourages visitors to call or email; they're happy to work with them and develop custom getaways. Many retreats are available by donation or suggested donation. The center also offers early registration discounts, student discounts and has a work exchange program. In the summer of 2015, the fourth annual four-day Yoga Fest is tentatively slated to be held with a selection of yoga teachers and assorted healers.

This is an age-old question, and it's been deeply considered by people for the last 5,000 years. As an acupuncturist. I am heavily influenced by the ancient Chinese philosophy known as Taoism. Taoists focus their attention on trying to understand change and transformation, the rhythms of the natural world, and they came to feel that the secret to health and longevity lay in going along with the energy of the universe, the Tao. As we look around us now, we see the energy of the world withdrawing and turning inwards. To follow the Tao, we would follow suit. The energy of the winter months is the utmost yin in the cycle of the seasons. Yin is embodied by the qualities of the earth itself. It is cool or cold, it is nourishing to the material/physical aspect, it is moistening, it is downwards, it is inwards, it is feminine, it is expressed in plants by the roots. In this Yin time, we should return to and nourish our roots. This means that we ought to behave in ways that are not contrary to the energy of the natural world around us. We should be more sedentary actually. Look at the animals. They often go so far as to literally hibernate. For us, this means that we should go to bed earlier, be more limited in our exercise and sexual activity. Be quieter, less social, less ambitiously hustle bustling about. The trees are not trying to grow and expand right now, because that is not the energy of this season. You feel like you just want to curl up with a book? That's because you should. At the same time, it is important to nurture the yang in us as well at this time of year. If yin energy is embodied by the earth, then yang energy is embodied by the sun. It is warming and expansive and active. It is expressed in plants by the tips of the shoots, by the top of the tree reaching skyward. We should be eating more cooked, hot and hearty foods to counteract and balance the cold yin of the season. Meats and root vegetables, winter squash and potatoes, for example, would be excellent. Using warming spices like cinnamon and clove are also very appropriate. There is a good reason that these things are already a part of the diet of the winter season. It is because we instinctively feel the desire for balancing with these foods, and because they are naturally and seasonally available. Too much raw or cold food at this time of year can be hard on the system, and can lead to cold disorders of the digestion, and other organ systems. The organ which is said to be most nourished and affected by this time of year is the kidney. The kidneys are the root of our vitality in Chinese Medicine, and they anchor the yin aspect of our beings. We need them to be supported so that we can sustain the energy of our growth and expansion in the spring, and stay cool and moistened internally during the hot summer months. Like good roots, we need them to help anchor and ground us energetically. Without this grounding we suffer. We have fatigue, we have restlessness, anxiety, poor sleep, and a host of other discomforts associated with weak kidneys. In Chinese medicine, the emotional energies are recognized as very powerful forces affecting our health. Emotionally, the kidneys are most affected by fear. During this time, in particular, we ought to try to embrace our deep personal work, turning inwards more and facing those fears which are deep within us all. We may find that we feel more depressed or emotionally exhausted. This could be due to a myriad of factors of course, including the sedate energy of the season, the lack of sunlight, the isolation inherent in the difficulty of getting out and about. This may also be due to the resistance we have to doing our work. The hard work of feeling, of going inwards and witnessing our injuries and giving them the love and attention they need to heal. Turn inwards and bring your attention to your feelings. It is not easy. No one really likes it. But if we can bring love and acceptance to our fears and injuries, we can do some wonderful healing. The work has its own rewards; a healthier emotional foundation upon which to build and grow, when the season of our lives turns once more toward spring. So try to embrace this season. Allow the energy of winter to be what it is and try not to resist it. This is what I tell myself. \"Come on Brodie, don't fight it, use this time wisely to nurture that within you which is nourished by this energy. Do your work and go with the Tao of life.\" Brodie Burris graduated from the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine in San Francisco. He has been practicing and studying Acupuncture and Chinese medicine in Ann Arbor since 1998.

Main St., Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104 Being gluten free myself, omelets really have become a staple of my diet, and the Joaquin Yahoo omelet at The Broken Egg is probably the best omelet I've ever eaten. Actually, it might be the best use of cheese I've ever tasted. I think it has something to do with the aged cheddar flavor combined with the veggies, salsa, and sour cream.

Produce at The Produce StationA vegetarian diet, a paleo diet, and a raw diet all walk into a bar ... or a grocery store, or a restaurant, or your breakroom at work, or your catered event, or even your own dining room. Many of us have experienced this type of scenario lately, where we are suddenly juggling the conflicting diets of our friends, our kids, or our guests. Or we might be the guest in an environment where we don't want to be rude or draw attention to our dietary choices by not participating in the highly social act of eating together. So here we're going to look at the options for a vegetarian, a person eating grain free, and a person eating only raw foods to have a meal together at any one of the following highly diverse restaurants, and get some ideas about what is available almost anywhere for a group of hungry (diet or allergen restricted) friends. (Note that grain free includes paleo and gluten-free diets.)

We can work more comfortably with these seasonal rhythms by nourishing ourselves and our families with yummy seasonal foods. While spring and summer are active times for movement and cleansing (think salads, watermelons, cucumbers, and cold soups), winter calls for foods that warm, nourish, and mineralize our bodies (think soups, stews, dense foods, and baked goods). The natural health community often emphasizes the value of cleansing, yet equally, or even more important, is our need for nourishing foods that build, replenish, and re-mineralize, which is winter's work. It has been said that if protein (amino acids) are the building blocks of a healthy body, minerals are the grid \u2014 responsible for the structure of the body at every level. So lovely cold-weather recipes will not only bring beautiful colors to lift winter spirits, but will also nourish deeply during this \"rebuilding phase\" with flavors that warm the belly and assist cold weather digestion. Foods that are \"in season\" locally tend to have the components that especially support the body through that local climate and season; here in Michigan this means roots that would be stored during cold (hopefully not too long!) winters. Look for recipes that include your favorites among these top ingredients: Winter squashes and root vegetables , such as pumpkin, butternut, acorn, Hubbard, carrots, sweet potatoes, and yams. Orange and yellow vegetables are especially rich in beta-carotene, a pre-formed vitamin A. Vitamin A is essential for proper immune function and respiratory health, and has often been found to be deficient in people that suffer from repeated sinus and respiratory infections. The body can manufacture vitamin A when it's supplied with ample amounts of beta-carotene-rich foods and healthy fats (including saturated) and lacto-fermented foods (containing healthy bacteria or probiotics.) People that find themselves consistently sick in the winter may also want to consider indulging in fermented cod liver oil and organic grass-fed liver, two food sources especially rich in bio-available vitamin A. Healthy fats \u2014 such as nuts, cold pressed flax seed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, coconut oil and full-fat coconut milk, fermented cod liver oil, avocado, butter, and for those that eat meat, grass-fed beef, tallow, and lard \u2014 feed our brains and support healthy immune systems. (Yes, really. See www.westonaprice.org/ for more.)Warming spices, such as ginger, garlic, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamom, and red pepper, 'heat us up' and support healthy winter digestion and absorption. Broths \u2014 make them simply with a Crock-pot full of water, quality sea salt, and lots of sulphur-containing foods such as onions and garlic; with simmering, their heat mellows to a rich broth. This food may also help your family members with winter skin problems such as eczema, as this naturally occurring sulphur helps to keep oils circulating through the body and the skin hydrated. One true traditional \"super food\" is bone broth \u2014 fish, chicken, or beef. A nutrient-dense and delicious broth can be made with an inexpensive beef cut (ox-tails, for instance), which are available from your local pastured farm source. Per quart of water: \u00bd tb sp.-taste quality sea salt 1 2 clo ves garlic \u00bd cele ry stick 1 c arrot 1 k elp strip \u00bc cup brandy (optional, adds fabulous flavor, and alcohol cooks out)Simmer 8 to 10 hours or until meat falls off the bones. Use as base for black bean soup, hearty vegetable stew, or chili. Strain it, and then add meat back in. Can blend it up as a thick base, and don't be dismayed by its weird look when it gels in the fridge! Enhance soups with small additions such as: A s trip of kelp (supports thyroid function, breast health, metabolism, bone growth) A s trip of Astragalus (very strong anti-viral properties, immune supporting herb, remove before serving) A bunch of par sley (chopped in, or simmered in as a bunch in the last 10 minutes of cooking and removed before serving) Good salt (unr efined sea salt or 'Real Salt'; Celtic provides essential trace minerals) Bur dock root (chopped small in stews, supports healthy liver, gall bladder, and skin function) A tb sp. of quality gelatin (good for hair, skin, joints) Even the act of cooking these simmering meals can bring joy and healing. As the house fills with delicious tempting aromas, our physical health is enhanced when our digestive enzymes have time to get ready as our \"mouths water,\" and our heart and memories are warmed.

Conscious and T asty Eating and Nutrition Nourishing Recipe The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 41 Root Medicine and Winter T onics By Anna Fernandez The life force in a biannual or perennial plant is evident in the greenness of its leaves and the vibrancy of its flower. As it begins to die back in the fall, that life force is not lost; it is transferred into the root, which embraces it and keeps it safe until the next growing season. Thinking of it this way, when using roots as medicines, one can see why the best time to harvest such a treasure is in the late fall or early spring \u2014 when the life force is still strongest in the root. Winter is an important time to take certain root medicines because of the nature of our winter lifestyles; eating heavier foods and spending less time outdoors results in less digestive vitality and lack of activity, which can make us vulnerable to illness. Certain roots can be taken daily over time to restore and tone the organs and systems, bringing about overall health and well-being and potentially preventing imbalance and disease. Herbs taken in this way are called tonics. Other roots are taken for a short duration in response to acute symptoms. Many local Michigan plants have roots that are considered tonics. Some are abundant, well known, and considered to be like a food. Others are more medicinal and often harder to find. Southeast Michigan boasts an array of both. Dandelion root is an easy-to-find tonic herb known for its nutritive value. It is gentle yet effective for improving liver, gallbladder, and overall digestive function, and it may also help normalize blood sugar levels. This underutilized plant may play a key role in preventative medicine. Burdock root is rich in minerals and can be eaten in stir-fries and is great in soups. Burdock is used as a tonic to support the liver and aid in digestion. It helps to restore normal function by improving metabolism and aiding in the elimination of waste products. This root also stimulates circulation in the skin and is frequently used for skin conditions, especially ones of the dry and scaly variety that often present during the winter months. The root of the Astragalus plant is used as an immune tonic to strengthen the overall immune system, build resistance, and prevent common infections. Mild in flavor, it is a great addition to hearty winter soups. Adaptogens are a group of herbs considered to be the ultimate tonics. Many of the most highly revered adaptogens are roots. These herbs increase overall health and vitality by modulating the body's response to stressors via the endocrine system, which in turn boosts immune and nervous system function. Some adaptogen roots include Ginseng, Ashwagandha, Eleuthero, and Licorice. Echinacea root, although not considered a tonic, is widely used as an immune boosting herb taken over a short duration in frequent doses at the first sign of a sniffle. It boosts white blood cell count and encourages the body to do the housecleaning necessary to stay healthy. These roots can be harvested and made into winter medicines, including teas, tinctures syrups, capsules, and so on. Alternatively, you can find them in many forms at your local herbalist or health food store. These roots are a small representation of herbs available for maintaining wellness. It makes sense that the deep, earthy energy of roots would play a role in helping us stay healthy in the long, dark, and cold winter months.

Nursing Tea \u2014 Used by breastfeeding mothers to enrich their milk and support healthy lactation. One-fourth cup red raspberry; one-fourth cup nettle; two tablespoons lemon verbena; two tablespoons spearmint. Family Immune Tea \u2014 Families frequently credit this drink for its ability to prevent \"catching what everyone else has!\" It's a delicious and healthy beverage to drink year-round instead of juice or soda pop. Half-cup red cup (optional; adds fruit flavor). Lemony-Lavender \u2014 This warm, winter twist on lemonade is sure to sweeten your day! One heaping teaspoon lavender; one-fourth cup chamomile; juice from one or two fresh squeezed lemons; raw honey to taste. Add lemon juice after herbs have been steeped and strained.

Nutrient-dense slippery elm soothes sore throats, heals irritated digestive tracts, and combats both constipation and diarrhea. One tablespoon each per one cup of hot water; do not make \"a pot,\" as it gels up. Start by making a paste with the two ingredients, adding hot water slowly. Drink immediately, taking care to cool a bit for children. Brain Food \u2014 Feeling some brain fog? These herbs are traditionally used to support cognitive function . About three heaping tablespoons each of gotu kola, ginko, lemon balm, peppermint. Relaxing Tea \u2014 Couldn't we all use a breath, a moment, and some relaxation support? About three heaping tablespoons each of chamomile, lemon verbena, oatstraw, skullcap, and spearmint. Brewing Directions: Boil a half gallon of water and stir in the herbs. Cover and let sit at least four hours or overnight (no heat). Strain and squeeze out the herbs; sweeten, if desired, with maple syrup or raw honey; and refrigerate. Drink two-plus cups per day, reheating on the stovetop or drinking as an \"iced tea.\" Herbal infusions typically last three to four days. Enjoy and experiment!

By Beth Barbeau and Juliana Sutton Herbal infusions are an excellent caffeine-free alternative to traditional teas. Unlike true teas \u2014 such as black, green, white, or oolong \u2014 herbal infusions are not harvested from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. These infusions, quite confusingly, are also referred to as \"teas.\" Technicalities aside, \"tea\" in our culture is generally referred to as a beverage steeped for a few minutes or so in hot water. And \"infusion\"is generally used to mean a beverage (even a medicinal brew) steeped for an extended period of time. These infusions are made by steeping the leaves or flowers of a plant in water, and the roots, bark, and berries are generally simmered (or steeped a longer time) to extract the medicinal chemical constituents. These naturally healthy brews carry various healing properties. Components provide nourishment for the immune, respiratory, digestive, nervous, or reproductive systems, and ingredients are often rich in vitamins, minerals, and other key nutrients. Infusions are the liquid gold in our homes! Here are some great ones to try (other herbalists might compose similarly, but we originated these blends ourselves): Warming Circulatory Tea \u2014This warming and invigorating blend is an excellent choice for the cold winter months, as it contains herbs used by traditional herbalists to combat the dreary symptoms of seasonal illness and support cardiovascular function. Two to four tablespoons fresh grated ginger; one-fourth cup lemongrass; half-cup hawthorn berries. Minty Green \u2014 This blend provides benefits of the \"greens\" we need, just in y our cup instead of your salad! Nettle provides adrenal support, combats seasonal allergies, and nourishes the blood. Red raspberry leaf provides seasonal support for colds and flus due to its astringent properties. Alfalfa is rich in cleansing chlorophyll and has been coined the \"King of Herbs\" due to its rich mineral content.

By Crysta CoburnSavor the Local Food Scene: The Argus Farm Stop A new farmers' market has popped up at the corner of 2 nd and Liberty on the Old West Side, a stone's throw from downtown Ann Arbor. The Argus Farm Stop, whose motto is \"our future is local,\" is open seven days a week, making it convenient for those of us who can't easily stop by the once-or-twice-a-week markets around town. Open until 7 p.m. Monday through Friday (and 6 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays), the Argus Farm Stop is easy to drop by on the way home from work to pick up fresh, locally sourced ingredients for dinner. The Argus Farm Stop has over 60 local suppliers, and the number is growing. Ensuring fresh produce and full shelves, \"farmers stop by all the time,\" said co-owner Bill Brinkerhoff. It is the farmers who determine the prices. Next to each basket or bin are stickers with bar codes printed on them. Fill a bag with however many of that fruit or vegetable you would like to purchase, then slap the appropriate barcode-sticker on the bag and take it to the counter where it is then scanned into the register. This ensures the right farmer receives the correct credit. You won't just find fresh produce, though, so don't worry about making this a seasonal excursion. Fresh bread and pastries, locally made soaps and candies, locally sourced dairy, eggs, meat (refrigerated and frozen), canned and jarred foods, pre-made salads and sandwiches, bagged coffee, dried pasta, and ice cream (my favorite) line the shelves. Does anyone remember the Brinery, whom I wrote about in the previous issue? You can get your garlic sauerkraut and Kvass fix at the Argus Farm Stop, too. I want to highlight one of the bagged coffee beans you'll find on the shelf because it's my favorite local roaster, Roos. As soon as you step through the door of the Argus Farm Stop, you are greeted by the friendly baristas of the coffee counter and all of the wonderful aromas that accompany freshly ground beans and an espresso machine. I was recently introduced to the honey latte (sometimes called caf\u00e9 miel), a shot of espresso with steamed milk, dashes of cinnamon, and honey. The honey latte I ordered at the Argus Farm Stop was a cup of liquid bliss. Hands down, it is the best I have yet tried. Another fun thing I encountered while perusing the shelves was basil ice cream put out by local ice cream maker Sweet Dirt, which may be recognized from the Ann Arbor Farmers' Market in Kerrytown. Here, you can buy Sweet Dirt's unique locally sourced and created ice creams and sorbets rain or shine. Argus Farms Stop is clearly and openly committed to our local food economy. \"Currently less than 1 percent of food is purchased directly from producers nationally, with over 99 percent going through traditional distribution channels,\" said Brinkerhoff. \"If we could grow the local and direct proportion to 5 percent locally, it would have a tremendous impact.\" If you live on the west side of downtown Ann Arbor, I strongly suggest keeping an eye on the ever-evolving Argus Farm Stop. Drop by for a honey latte, lunch, and maybe some good conversation with the wonderfully capable staff. The Argus Farm Stop is located at 325 W. Liberty Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48103 (on the corner of Liberty and 2 nd). It is open Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. For more information, including a PDF of the guidelines to which all of the producers are held, visit www.argusfarmstop.com/. Sparrow Kitchen Oddly enough, when someone asks me where they can get a great sandwich in Kerrytown, Zingerman's Deli is not the first thing to spring to mind. Now, we all know that Zingerman's is nationally famous, their selection of cheeses is one of the best around, and the people who run it are a fantastic group. That is probably why I so often see a line snaking out the door and around the building, especially on game days when the wait can be up to an hour, and if the president of the United States happens to be having lunch inside, you can forget about getting anywhere near the place (the Secret Service makes certain of it). A lot of us locals simply don't plan that far ahead when our stomachs start to grumble and we just want a sandwich. Tasty Discoveries at Caf\u00e9s, Markets, and Restaurants Around Town Fresh bread and pastries, locally made soaps and candies, locally sourced dairy, eggs, meat (refrigerated and frozen), canned and jarred foods, pre-made salads and sandwiches, bagged coffee, dried pasta, and ice cream line the shelves.The Argus Farm Stop has over 60 local suppliers, and the number is growing. My personal favorite sandwich at Sparrow is called the Kourtni, made up of a fried egg, spinach, goat cheese, red onion, bacon, and avocado.Cafe OllieThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 44 Conscious and T asty Eating and Nutrition Caf\u00e9 Ollie in Ypsilanti Argus Farm Stop This is where the Sparrow Kitchen comes in. The hours and selections are limited, but this modest grill is conveniently located next to the check-out counter just inside the Sparrow Meat Market (which sells much more than meat, by the way) in the Kerrytown Shops, just a block down the brick road from Zingerman's and next to the Farmers' Market. The Sparrow Kitchen actually serves Zingerman's bread, and they don't like it when people talk trash about their neighbors, so please no complaining about the long line outside the deli that you may have just ditched. My personal favorite sandwich is called the Kourtni, made up of a fried egg, spinach, goat cheese, red onion, bacon, and avocado. I usually get mine in wrap form, but you have your choice of bread for every sandwich, and it costs only about six dollars. Since they make all sandwiches fresh, it's pretty easy to work around food sensitivities by having them leave off select ingredients. On the sad, sad days that the kitchen is not open (Sunday and Monday), or I don't make it in time (they close at 3 p.m.), I buy one of the pre-made sandwiches from Sparrow Meat Market's pre-made lunch to-go case. (That's my own special name for it, but you can use it, too, if you want.) Since I can't eat ham, I generally opt for the turkey with goat cheese and spinach for five dollars, a delightful combination, or the vegetarian option with hummus instead of meat (though that one seems to disappear quickly). There are also delicious \u2014 and filling \u2014 yogurt parfaits, string cheese, salads, fresh fruit, and bags of chips for 99 cents. Since I spend about three days a week in Kerrytown, I pick up food from Sparrow fairly often. Yes, it is pricier than the average grocery store, but I feel more confident that the food I am getting is higher quality and mostly locally sourced. Sparrow's meat counter is widely respected as one of the finest in Ann Arbor, and it is these high quality meats that go into making some of the best sandwiches in Kerrytown. The Sparrow Kitchen is open Tuesday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. and is located inside the Kerrytown Shops at 407 N. Fifth Avenue, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104. Caf\u00e9 Ollie In the heart of Ypsilanti's hot spot, Depot Town, is Caf\u00e9 Ollie. Billing itself as a vegetarian and vegan restaurant, beer garden, and ice cream parlour, Caf\u00e9 Ollie successfully combines the atmospheres of a coffee house, soda fountain, and neighborhood sandwich shop, making it one caf\u00e9 that is not to be missed. Whether you are in the mood for some vegetarian breakfast nachos or an afternoon beer float (yes, a beer float), Caf\u00e9 Ollie has you covered. I feel I should mention up front that despite touting itself as a vegetarian restaurant, meat is served. There are wonderful vegetarian and vegan options for nearly all dishes, so I would still count Caf\u00e9 Ollie as one of the best vegetarian stops around. When you enter, there is the soda fountain and ice cream counter to your right and a bank of coolers containing cold, mostly local, bottled beers and sodas on the left. You order your meal at the counter, pay, and are handed an old vinyl record single (I once got Aretha Franklin's \"Until You Say You Love Me\") with a number painted on it, which you take with you to your seat. Your food will then be brought out to you as soon as it is prepared. You could start your day with a delicious breakfast sandwich, burrito, scramble, or cinnamon walnut pancakes, then mix it up at lunch with a Hale Yeah! (turkey, bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato, Swiss, and mayonnaise on sourdough), Bad N Moody (corned beef, cream cheese, and spicy mustard on rye), or Count Macula wrap (macaroni and cheese, hot dog, and spicy ranch). Why the lunch menu item names are so much more colorful than the breakfast offerings is anyone's guess. The sandwiches are divided into three sections \u2014 those with meat, vegetarian, and vegan. Too busy to eat-in? Delivery is from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday, or you may pick up your pre-ordered meal until 8:45 p.m. The delivery minimum is 10 dollars and costs an extra 2 dollars per order, pretty standard for the Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti region. The delivery map on their website shows that they cover a good bit of Ypsilanti, including all of Depot Town and Downtown, plus most of Eastern Michigan University's campus. Unlike downtown Ann Arbor, parking in Depot Town is free (one of its finest features, in my opinion), and the area is small and walkable. Grab some hot tea or specialty coffee from Caf\u00e9 Ollie and enjoy a leisurely stroll through the nearby Frog Island or Riverside parks and the adjacent shops. Weather too cold? Snuggle up inside with your laptop and get some work done or relax with friends. On my last visit, I just needed to get away from being cooped up in my apartment, so I grabbed my latest library paperback and camped out for an hour while sipping hot cocoa and noshing on a lemon poppy seed scone with the perfect drizzle of sweet icing. What an exquisite way to start one's day. Caf\u00e9 Ollie is located at 42 E. Cross Street, Ypsilanti, Michigan 48198. You can peruse their menu and order online at cafeollieypsilanti.com/. The hours are Tuesday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., Sunday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., closed Monday. El Harissa Market Caf\u00e9 I firmly believe that the many and varied regions surrounding the Mediterranean Sea produce some of the best cuisines in the world. Nowhere is that better illustrated than at El Harissa Market Caf\u00e9 near the corner of Miller and Maple in Ann Arbor. The flavors are so intense, I could have eaten until I burst. My first taste was of the gluten-free, all-meat Merguez Meatballs. I was warned that they were a little spicy, which is mostly true. They are packed with spices, none of them hot, and the red sauce they swam in was another culinary delight. I was told the sauce takes eight hours to cook, and the way the spices blend so perfectly together absolutely shows off how much time and care went into making it. These were the best meatballs I have ever had in my life (sorry, Mom). Next up was the Berber Terrine du Poulet. It basically looks like a meat muffin and is composed of ground chicken, potatoes, eggs, green onion, red peppers, and spinach. The sauce for this dish is coconut-based and flavored with curry leaves and more tantalizing spices. Most of the food is sold by the pound, but these terrines, for whatever reason, are priced individually, so if you are trying to keep an eye on your budget, watch out for that. It was also served with a plate of fresh pita bread, which I ate with the terrine and used to sop up all remaining sauces from both dishes. I found the prices of the food, beverages, and gelato to be very reasonable, especially considering how amazing the food is. All meat is halal, and every dish is labeled with potential allergens (eggs, nuts, etc.), and whether it is gluten-free, vegan or vegetarian, making it a very easy place to navigate for those with food sensitivities. There is quite a bit to keep vegans and vegetarians just as happy as their meat-eating companions. (Try the Ful Medamis, the \"quintessential street food of Cairenes\" according to the website, or Grilled Asparagus with Gribiche Sauce.) There is even a vegan strawberry gelato for dessert. The two non-vegan, but 100 percent kosher, gelato flavors I tried were spiced hazelnut fig and risotto (rice, cinnamon, and chunks of chocolate). Words fail at just how delicious that was, and I am so grateful that in gelato culture, it is customary to receive two flavors per serving. I ordered the smallest size, the four-ounce cup, and it was more than enough to satisfy any dessert craving I might ever have. Before I close this, I have to give El Harissa a special nod for including Lady Grey tea alongside Earl Grey among their beverage choices. Trademarked by Twinings of London, this is not a tea blend one often finds, and it is one of my favorites. Yes, I can approximate my own version by squeezing fresh lemon into Earl Grey, but it just isn't the same. They also offer Turkish coffee, which gives me and boyfriend both something to sip and enjoy while devouring the most excellent feast that El Harissa Market Caf\u00e9 offers. Located at 1516 North Maple Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48103, El Harissa Market Caf\u00e9 is open from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily.

The doshas are the three energies present in all things that work together to fuel your body and maintain your health as long as you \"feed\" them correctly, with the right lifestyle activities and foods. If you don't feed them right, they get \"aggravated\" and turn into health-sabotaging gremlins. So, here are the \"CliffsNotes\" on how to feed these little buggers so they stay balanced, without swinging wildly into dominating each other or becoming deficient, and how to tell if \"you're doin' it wrong.\" There are three doshas: Vata, Vata means \"life-wind\" and includes pretty much everything you'd expect it to when you think of wind. It's great in the form of \"dried out\" crispy snacks. But you don't want any Vata aggravating beans increasing your \"life wind\" at a party, because it will do that too. Digestive difficulties that produce gas are always Vata related. Feeding instructions: Vata is hyper and antsy, so feed your Vata the same thing you'd feed your kids if you wanted them to sit still and be quiet for a nice dinner: vegetables, all kinds, with some nice berries and nutritious salads full of dark leafy greens. Also, fermented veggies like kimchi or sauerkraut will have it purring like a kitten. Do not feed it: Dry stuff that lasts forever. Vata wants to mummify you! Don't help it! If you could stock your pantry, cellar, or bomb shelter with it, you can expect it to dry your Vata energy into its gremlin form, which in Vata's case is stiff and desiccated. Vata also takes issue with beans, including soy, peanuts, and yes, even flax seeds, because they have too much harsh, brittle, wind-producing fiber in them. How do you know if your Vata energy is happy: You feel cool, dry, mobile, changeable, light, and active. If you can move without creaking, groaning, or crackling, you're good. How to tell if it's become the Vata gremlin: Vata dries things out like a creaky door in need of WD-40. Anything that is dry, stiff, or deficient somehow has aggravated Vata. If something is flaking off, drying out, wasting away, or freezing up, you have a Vata problem. Also, Vata is the absence of stuff like hormones, nutrients, oils, and other important juices like the fluid in joints, so it gets more aggravated with age as our bodies stop making all the stuff kids' bodies make (those little super secreters.) 2. The Pitta \"Fire Energy\": Pitta means \"that which cooks things,\" which is wonderful if it's digesting that half gallon of ice cream you really should not have eaten, but it's bad if it's eating a hole in your stomach. It's overzealous enough to do that. Feeding instructions: Foods that keep the pilot light going without torching it are best, like mild peppers and black pepper, naturally sour foods like fresh citrus fruits, moderate amounts of clean meats (that aren't fried), eggs, natural salts, and aromatic foods like garlic and spices. Do not feed it: Table salt, processed meats, fried stuff, fiery spicy foods that you might anticipate burning the same on the way out that it did on the way in. (Turns your Pitta grease fire into a mushroom cloud.) Also, extremely sour things are bad because apparently they cause \"flabbiness.\" Pitta gremlins can perform the \"skinny fat\" trick where people look thin but what little meat they do have on their bones is not muscle but flab. How do you know if your Pitta Energy is happy: You feel hot, bright, penetrating, burning, luminous, spreading...I know that sounds weird, but stick with me. Imagine it as a personality trait, not just as a description of your body. So, think of penetrating as mentally sharp and ambitious, and spreading as super active and influential. Got it? How to tell if it's become the Pitta gremlin: Pitta makes heat, pain, and stink when it's angry. If heat, pain, or a foul odor are on the list of symptoms, there is Pitta involved. It can also make you have insatiable thirst and that ravenous hunger (that makes you really cranky) that Snickers advertises. It can get rather snippy and anti-social on an empty stomach. 3. The Kapha \"Earth and Water Energy\": Kapha means \"that which holds things together,\" like Jell-O holding fruit cocktail in suspended animation. It's great for things like holding your organs in place and keeping things perky looking, but it can get out of control. Muffin tops and spare tires are side effects of aggravating this guy. Feeding instructions: Good healthy Kapha foods include cultured dairy like yogurt and kefir, grass-fed butter, coconut oil, and good quality cheeses. Natural sweeteners like raw honey and unfiltered maple syrup are included along with nutrient dense starches like sweet potatoes and buckwheat. Do not feed it: Large amounts of frozen or gelatinous stuff. Big piles of starch, especially processed grains and flours. Also, things that are excessively sweet, including no-calorie artificial sweeteners. A Kapha gremlin doesn't care if its sugar rush is \"real\" or not. This is why you see all those studies recently about how artificial sweeteners cause all the same diseases that processed sugars do. In Ayurveda, the body's reaction to something trumps the actual effect of the thing itself. So, too bad about all that fake sugar and fake fat. Never going to work...ever. How do you know if your Kapha Energy is happy: You feel cold, damp, heavy, opaque, and still. That sounds gross, but you know you need a little of that mixed in to have any substance. Think of damp as \"hydrated,\" and heavy or cold as \"solid,\" like a brick house. Yeah! Just think of Kapha as the quality of not falling apart, ok? How to tell if it's become the Kapha gremlin: The Kapha gremlin looks like Jabba the Hutt and it's trying to recruit you by telling you that pasta is on your diet. It insists pancakes are a complete breakfast and offers you half off your next grande syrup-drizzled extra whip frozen frapp\u00e9 concoction. Don't listen! If any of these gremlins are aggravated don't feed them at all! They're going to bed without dinner. For example, if your Kapha is a gremlin, only eat Vata and Pitta foods. No Kapha until it goes back into it's natural balanced mode, playing nicely with the other two energies! Sometimes two or three doshas go gremlin at once, and in that case, take Triphala, an herb mixture for drawing all three energies down from their gremlin states into cooperation with each other (like garlic to repel vampires), and see an Ayurveda health practitioner. Left untreated, dosha gremlins will make you crave foods to increase them to super gremlins. That's why you see waifish extreme Vatas skipping meals to train for their ultra-marathons. Your extreme Pitta friends sucking down three different flavors of margarita at once, with salt on the rim, and a steak for garnish. And extreme Kapha people who already have weight problems developing a mighty need for wheat products and ice cream.

We're going to Casey's Tavern to do that, because that's my happy place, and I'm writing this article, so that's where we're going. We're looking for things that won't make our drinking buddies think we're nuts. So, we'll skip piles of dry lettuce, naked burger patties, or whipped cream \u00e0 la carte. (They will actually give you a plate of whipped cream \u00e0 la carte here; God bless these people. But, that's not sustainable.) We want balance, but we are eating out, so let's not rule out comfort food. We'll be stricter at home. For a Vata gremlin, you'll need to get some good comforting food in your poor atrophied little belly. You might not tolerate allergens like bread, but try to pick sweet and cooling things like an Asian Chicken Salad with toasted coconut and little rice sticks to balance. If wheat is still your friend, go for a Clubhouse Sandwich on sourdough bread. Soured bread is easier to digest than regular breads, and the turkey with lettuce, tomato, and mayo come together to make a nice balance of energies. Probably have a hard cider to drink because it's sweet and simple. For Pitta gremlins, lay off the meat and grease. Maybe try a Meatless Joe. With it you'll get some good flavors that feel satisfying, like corn bread and lentils with rice, along with just a touch of those sour notes you like from tomato sauce, without loading up with fried foods and vinegary condiments that will rev up your digestive \"fires\" too much. If you have no problems with wheat, try a Mac-N-Cheese or some Bangkok Noodles so that the rest of us can live vicariously through your burning need for extra calories and your ability to digest nails. Oh yeah, and have a nice cooling beer to rub it in. For Kapha gremlins, we'll want to mix Vata and Pitta foods and avoid starch. A Southwestern Steak Caesar Salad, or actually any of the salads, would be good and surprisingly satisfying. Chew your food and savor each bite and you won't miss your starches. You could opt for Some Kind of Steak with broccoli or asparagus on the side and sub out salad for fries. Hold off on the beer...maybe sip a nice bourbon? Any one of these options tastes delicious and is satisfying enough that no one would label it \"diet food.\" Only we know that we're promoting a healthy energy balance by mindfully selecting a meal that will have a harmonious effect on our bodies instead of throwing them completely out of whack (like we might have done last Friday night.) To find a more complete run down of what energies are in individual food ingredients, reference Ayurveda: A Life of Balance (Healing Arts Press, 1994) by Maya Tiwari. Or, if you want to really become an expert on the full complement of lifestyle choices that accompany Ayurveda as a diet, you can start at the \"beginning,\" where most practitioners begin learning Ayurveda, which is the book Prakriti: Your Ayurvedic Constitution (Lotus Press, 1998) by Dr. Robert E. Svoboda. These books don't mention anything about gremlins. But if you're like me, typecasting the Ayurvedic doshas as character archetypes is a much more helpful mnemonic device than memorizing lists of characteristics. Brandi Lyons has been a student of Ayurveda for seven years and is an author and graphic artist living in Ann Arbor.We want balance, but we are eating out, so let's not rule out comfort food. We'll be stricter at home.Brandi Lyons: I see you work in physics. Do you find yourself mentally integrating Vedanta and Ayurveda with a physics based view of the world? Kapila Castoldi: My field is particle physics, the search for the ultimate building blocks of matter. Along with this, I have always had a deep love for astronomy, and eventually discovered a deep interconnection between the two, the microcosm and the macrocosm. Although I worked as an experimentalist, my interest in physics has always been more at the philosophical level. In time I realized that I would not be able to find the answers to my questions within physics, or at least, not yet. I had to look beyond and this eventually led me to metaphysics and spirituality. In time I discovered that my questions were already answered thousands of years ago at the intuitive level by the Vedic seers through their meditations. Now science is beginning to answer some of these questions experimentally, in very small steps. I believe that Vedanta applies to the modern world, just like it applied to ancient times. Things have changed only on the surface, mostly due to the fast paced technological development, but the questions that each of us carry deep inside have not changed. They may simply go unheard, because of the loud noises that surround our modern life. It is through the meditative process that we can quiet our minds and tap on this wisdom that lies deep inside us. Brandi Lyons: What led you to integrate meditation with Ayurveda? Kapila Castoldi: After a few years of meditation under the guidance of my spiritual teacher, Sri Chinmoy, I realized that the true practice of deep meditation requires that we prepare the ground for it by working on our mind, emotions, and our body. In spirituality the body is seen as a 'temple' that hosts the inner being and allows it to be manifested here on earth. That's when I became aware of Ayurveda. Eventually I met Kumudini Shoba, an Ayurveda practitioner from Seattle who is also a student of Sri Chinmoy. Over the past 20 years she has not only helped me maintain good health, but has also taught me quite a bit about the philosophy behind Ayurveda. She recently published a small book on Ayurveda, which offers simple guidance to beginners. You may check it out at her website, Service-Plants.com So, to summarize, Physics led me to Meditation, and Meditation to Ayurveda.\"~A Physicist's Path to Ayurveda~ A Brief Q&A with Kapila Castoldi \"I had to look beyond, and this eventually led me to metaphysics and spirituality.

Her new class, \"Ayurveda and Meditation: Ancient Wisdom for the Modern Life,\" is a basic introduction to the principles of Ayurveda and emphasizes the need for inner awareness, which can be achieved through meditation, along with the need for outer balance in our life, which can be achieved through Ayurveda.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 47 AstrologerElizabeth.com The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 48 For fourteen years, Kyle Morgan, D.O., has been staging a quiet revolution in her private practice. She is fervently devoted to a vision of medicine that looks for the underlying reasons why people get sick and works to address those reasons in order for patients to find true and lasting healing rather than just being treated for their symptoms. \"I figured that if I could learn what makes people sick, then I'd be one step closer to helping patients actually heal from their illnesses and ultimately 'regain' optimal health,\" said Dr. Morgan. The following story illustrates her determination to hunt down the root causes of illness. Years ago a 38-year-old patient named Brad came to her who had been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS). His speech was incomprehensible to her, so she had to get his medical history from his family. He was in a wheelchair and had no use of his right arm, but he was still able to comprehend everything around him. He slouched forward and drooled. His face revealed no emotion when he spoke: no smiles, no frowns, nothing. His disease was at an advanced stage, and he was on a medication that was not helping. Things looked grim. Dr. Morgan sees \"diagnoses\" through a very different lens than traditional medicine. Even though many of her patients come to her having been given a specific diagnosis, she looks past that to their individual symptoms and seeks a cause rather than a label. She explained, \"I look for the underlying reason why someone was given a particular diagnosis. My experience with ALS has been that, upon further investigation, the symptoms are caused by toxins [and/or] pathogens (specifically Lyme). I am not looking to cure the ALS as much as to relieve the symptoms.\" People who come to her have experienced doctors who want to manage symptoms instead of resolve root causes. What she offers patients like Brad is a deeper understanding of what is making his body ill and alternatives that will enhance his well-being. In the first visit, Dr. Morgan took an in-depth medical history and discovered that Brad had been in the Gulf War and had been exposed to many toxic chemicals. Since there are no available \"Agent Orange\" tests, Dr. Morgan's first step was to run a heavy metals toxin screen and a pathogen screen. The tests showed extremely high levels of lead and the Lyme disease bacteria. Dr. Morgan prescribed chelation therapy for the lead and put him on a specialized home intravenous therapy for the Lyme disease. Within three months, Brad showed signs of improvement. Dr. Morgan said, I'll never forget the day that he first smiled at me. I was elated because I knew that day he was on the road to wellness. He had never smiled at me before. And I was better able to understand his speech. It was like watching him being released from a cage, the cage of his own body. By the end of six months, he was able to speak freely, had regained about fifty percent use of his right arm, and could walk using a rolling walker. After two more months, Dr. Morgan realized much to her disappointment that Brad's recovery had reached a plateau. But she did not give up. By now, she was able to talk to Brad directly, so she asked more questions about his history. His second wife had given Dr. Morgan the first medical history, but there was a vital piece of information that his wife had never known. At one point, Brad had been an exterminator and was exposed to highly toxic chemicals. Upon hearing this, Dr. Morgan ordered another toxin screen specifically for those chemicals. Two weeks later, the results came back positive. Dr. Morgan put him on several natural supplements to flush the chemicals out of his body. Six months later, he was nearly symptom free. \"One of the last times I saw Brad he was able to walk with a normal gait at normal speed, was able to converse freely with emotion, and had regained about ninety percent use of his right arm. He was still in physical therapy for the remaining muscle atrophy, but overall, he felt tremendous relief. He wept openly and expressed his gratitude to be alive and freed of the disease that had kept him trapped inside of his body for so long.\" It is results like Brad's that reinforce Dr. Morgan's determination to seek out root causes of illness. This wasn't always her mission, though. Dr. Morgan was the oldest of three kids, and her father was a traditional M.D. He was scientifically oriented and very traditional in his medical beliefs. \"I wanted to be a doctor from the time I was a kid, but in my family, the boys were the ones who were supposed to be doctors, not the girls, even though neither of my brothers could get into medical school. I was presented with three career choices growing up: elementary teacher, a nurse, or social worker. The primary reason my parents sent me to college, though, was to get my 'MRS' degree.\" Dr. Morgan started as a nursing major. In her second year of nursing, her organic chemistry teacher asked her to stay after class one day. \"I was so nervous because I didn't know what I had done wrong. I was shocked when my teacher told me he thought I should go to medical school. But I thought, I can't do that, I'm a girl. Because that's how I was raised.\" Between her second and third year of nursing, she started her clinical rotations. Two weeks into the program, she told her director sarcastically, \"I don't think I can be a nurse because I'm afraid I'm going to kill somebody, but it won't be a patient, it will be a doctor.\" Frustrated with the male-dominated system, Dr. Morgan quit nursing and graduated with a B.A. in religion from Capitol University in Columbus, Ohio. She got a master's in social work administration from the University of Chicago, went to seminary and then got another master's in theology. She also met and married a Lutheran minister, finally getting her \"MRS\" degree, and went on to have two children. By the time she graduated from seminary, she had become so disillusioned with the institutionalized church that she decided not to become ordained. But it wasn't so easy to walk away from ordination in the Lutheran church. \"I had to have an exit interview with the bishop and find a way to gracefully exit. Lutheran ministers have to chant during services, so I told the bishop I had to quit because I couldn't sing,\" Dr. Morgan said, laughing. \"This was a time when women were trying to change the church, so it didn't surprise me a whole lot when he didn't fight me on it.\" For the next year, she worked in Ypsilanti and acted as a good pastor's wife... sort of. \"I told my husband, 'I will pour coffee for you twice after services. Pick the first time carefully,'\" she said with a sly grin. Both she and her husband decided to apply to doctorate programs in theology. They both applied to the same eleven schools, including Yale, Harvard, Berkeley, Princeton, Notre Dame, Emory, University of Chicago, and Vanderbilt, with the plan of moving to attend whichever one they both were admitted to. \"I got into ten,\" said Dr. Morgan, \"and he got into none. This was the straw that broke the camel's back for our marriage.\" Soon after they divorced. Being a single mom, she was now restricted to schools in the Midwest. Dr. Morgan ended up commuting to the University of Chicago for two years. \"So I had taken my classes, learned seven languages, and was preparing to be the first person ever to write a dissertation in the field of ancient Egyptian healing arts,\" recalled Dr. Morgan, \"when my advisor, Professor Ioan Culianu, who had become a dear friend and colleague, was brutally murdered.\" Professor Culianu was from Romania. Once Kyle Morgan, D.O. The New Medicine By Jeanne Ballew For fourteen years, Kyle Morgan, D.O., has been staging a quiet revolution in her private practice. \"I was presented with three career choices growing up: elementary teacher, a nurse, or social worker.\" -Dr. Kyle MorganPeople who come to her have experienced doctors who want to manage symptoms instead of resolve root causes. By the time she graduated from seminary, she had become so disillusioned with the institutionalized church that she decided not to become ordained.Photos by Susan AyerThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 49 he got his green card, he started speaking out against the Communist regime after the death of the Romanian dictator Ceauescu. Professor Culianu went to the bathroom everyday before class, and one day \"they\" simply gunned him down in the bathroom. His murder was never solved, but most people assumed he had been assassinated for his outspoken political views. The only other person who could be Dr. Morgan's advisor was in France, but she couldn't go there because of her kids. \"I was heartbroken. I lost my friend, and my dream was shattered along with the vision for my future,\" recalled Dr. Morgan. She decided to work for a while until she figured out what to do. Throughout all of her schooling, she had had a variety of jobs and had done a lot of volunteer work at soup kitchens and even for Jesse Jackson's Rainbow PUSH Coalition. She was working as an administrator and counselor at the SOS Crisis Center in Ypsilanti when she developed her own health crisis that traditional allopathic medicine couldn't help. She ended up going to a chiropractor and a homeopath, both of whom helped her to heal, thus opening up the world of alternative medicine to her. \"My chiropractor offered the chance to restore health rather than just the band-aid approach of treating symptoms,\" said Dr. Morgan. \"I decided that I wanted to become a chiropractor, too, so I could help others the way that he had helped me.\" But at that time there were no chiropractic schools in Michigan (that is still the case). \"So that was when I finally decided to go to medical school and become the next best thing, a doctor of osteopathy,\" said Dr. Morgan. Being a single mom with two young children, she lived in Ann Arbor and commuted to Michigan State University. She also took numerous seminars outside of the medical curriculum, such as hands-on manipulation for chiropractors, energy-based medicine, and nutritional seminars, all of which contributed to her current philosophy of healing. Even before Dr. Morgan started medical school, however, she had a burning desire to know what makes people sick. She explained, Most people would agree that we feel best when we respect our body's fundamental need for adequate sleep and exercise, good nutrition, and some form of spiritual and/or social connection. These foundations of health also impact our hormonal health. In addition to maintaining a healthy foundation, however, my current understanding is that there are four primary reasons why we get sick: a) toxins, b) pathogens, c) genetic mutations, and d) negative experiences and beliefs. In addition to what I learned as a D.O., I added the following protocols to my practice to help address these four causes of illness: a) detoxification from heavy metals and environmental pollutants to address toxicity, b) a cutting edge technology called the Rife machine to eliminate harmful pathogens, c) cold laser treatments to address certain genetic mutations, and d) Brain Detox, a tool I developed to counteract the impact of negative experiences and beliefs. Of all of the tools Dr. Morgan has developed over the years, the one she is most passionate about is Brain Detox, a completely safe, painless technique that relies on the body's innate healing mechanisms to restore optimal health. \"This is my favorite tool because I see results so quickly,\" said Dr. Morgan, \"and the changes appear to be permanent. Brain Detox literally uses the brain to heal the body.\" Brain Detox is founded upon the relationship between the brain, in particular, the subconscious, and the nervous system. A core principle of Brain Detox is that negative beliefs, which can get recorded in the subconscious as a result of negative experiences, can cause an imbalance in the nervous system, which can then result in illness. To address these negative beliefs and experiences, Brain Detox relies on a surprisingly simple approach that uses specific positive statements to help rebalance the nervous system and restore health. Dr. Morgan explained: Normally, when we repeat positive statements, they stay in the conscious mind and can result in behavioral changes but do not necessarily reach the subconscious in such a way as to rectify illness. The subconscious regulates our autonomic nervous system, which regulates our physiology. Brain Detox 'downloads' these positive statements into our subconscious thus 'overwriting' the negativity, which balances our nervous system, resulting in healing.Though other mind-body healing modalities focus primarily on cognitive or emotional disorders, Brain Detox offers a substantial contribution by including physical conditions, thereby addressing the mind, the body, and the emotions. Brain Detox can be done at home or at Dr. Morgan's office, and in addition to the repetition of a set of positive statements, includes energy medicine exercises and self-administered \"light touch\" acupressure. She said it is as easy as reading, speaking, and moving. I have treated over 500 people using Brain Detox and taught a number of workshops. The applications of this tool are endless. I have seen results in patients with a wide range of conditions, including the following: allergies, high blood pressure, chronic pain, seizures, A.D.H.D., trauma, Crohn's disease, migraines, post-partum depression, insomnia, Parkinson's disease, Cerebral Palsy, psychosis, and alcohol abuse to name a few. The implications of this tool are exciting. These are just the results of one relatively small sample of people. Imagine the potential for healing if many people truly were to take healing into their own hands. Awareness of the healing relationship between the mind and the body is not new by any means. The mindfulness approach to dealing with stress has been in vogue in the U.S. since the 70's and is enjoying a larger following than ever today, but the physical \"side benefits\" have been more random than targeted, aside from obvious things like lowering blood pressure. The main emphasis of the mindfulness movement has been on relaxation and managing stress. Some of the other mind/ body techniques such as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) or Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) have primarily addressed the emotional pain associated with conditions like P .T.S.D., anxiety, and depression. Brain Detox primarily addresses specific physical disorders or diseases as well as mental and emotional health. Dr. Morgan continues to research and explore what makes the body tick each time she encounters a challenging new condition. But more and more, the treatments she offers her patients lean toward \"do no harm\" and \"give the body what it needs to heal itself.\" Said Dr. Morgan, \"I never cease to be amazed by the beauty and power of how the brain can indeed heal the body.\" The thing Dr. Morgan likes most about being a doctor is that she can be completely herself. \"As a doctor I get to be a detective, researcher, student, advocate, and listener. I also get to be caring and compassionate, encouraging and proactive. And I so appreciate being able to figure out the underlying reason why people have health issues and helping them correct that so that they can be well.\" Dr. Kyle Morgan's office is located at 180 Little Lake Drive, Suite 4 (right off of Jackson Road), Ann Arbor, Michigan 48103.

They told of a preacher with a voice like honey butter, and a scary snake named Sam. Their voices rose and fell, they shifted and stomped, and their hands caressed the air. As the sun set over the horizon, members of the Ann Arbor Storytellers' Guild told their stories. And they told them well.The audience, filling every seat \u2014 and spilling into the aisles \u2014 at Crazy Wisdom was mesmerized. In a time when technology rules our culture, and entertainment is instantly, constantly available, the ancient art of storytelling is alive and well. Internationally, storytelling festivals, conferences and workshops abound; closer to home, the Ann Arbor Storytellers' Guild is thriving. The odd juxtaposition isn't lost on longtime storyteller and guild member Judy Schmidt. But it doesn't surprise her, either. \"It might actually be because of technology that storytelling is thriving,\" she says. \"I think people really miss that face time; storytelling is getting back to the basics. People don't sit around the kitchen table anymore and share stories, or talk about what happened that day. I think a lot of people simply miss that.\" Gertrude Warkentin, a relative newcomer to the storytelling scene, agrees. \"You have so much coming at you so fast these days,\" she says. \"People have a sense of having lost something. Maybe there is that sense of longing for just slowing down and telling stories. I will say that since I've started, I've really come to appreciate a good story.\" And whether it's a personal tale, a myth, a ghost story or something altogether different, telling a good story \u2014 one that keeps the rapt attention of the audience \u2014 is all about connecting.Telling a story to a group is very different than simply reading one to them, says guild member Beverly Black, who also teaches storytelling workshops. \"When you have a written work, it's just between you and the story. But when you're up there onstage, telling a story \u2014 maybe telling your own, personal story, it's extremely interactive,\" she says. \"Storytelling keeps you in the present; you're right there.\" What Makes a Good Story? Stories are a wonderful way to get to know people better, says Black. But even the best story can fall flat without forethought. For instance, she says, a story that an adult audience would find poignant or amusing could go right over the heads of younger children \u2014 and an older audience might not find the simplicity of a children's story very entertaining. Good storytellers know their audiences. She explains: \"There are three things that happen in a good story. You have the storyteller, the audience, and the story itself, and there has to be a connection. There has to be a connection between you and the story, and between you and the audience, to make it all work.\" Storytellers think on their feet, reading their audience to see how the tale is being received. Based on what they see, they might spontaneously change it, add to it, or even start over. \"There are so many different kinds of stories and storytellers,\" says guild member Laura Lee Hayes. \"Storytelling can be very physical. They say that with storytelling, only 20 percent is words. But we know some (tellers) who barely move \u2014 but then again, they know the power of the pause. It's those pauses, the tone of your voice, the pitch, the expression on your face, all of those go in to making stories.\" The Art of Storytelling Pictured Above (Left to right): Jill Halpern, Darryl Micken, Judy Schmidt, Laura Lee Hayes, Glen Modell, Elizabeth James, and Beverly Black By Diane Majeske Photos by Joni Strickfaden \"With a story, there's no special effects \u2014 it's all in your mind.\" \u2014 Guild member Darryl Mickels\"What happened was when I came back from the storytelling workshop, I tried it out on the schoolkids,\" she recalled. \"And I found out that when you're in your storytelling mode, people listen.\" She laughs. \"When I was teaching the card catalog, nobody cared. But this was different. They were listening ... and that's a really nice feeling.\" She started buying tapes, reading books, and listening to other storytellers. She realized that a good story, like a good book, needs a plot and characters \u2014 but it also needs to be compressed, with each word carefully chosen. \"You can't spend pages on description, and pages on background,\" she says. \"You don't have that luxury. You can have a really good idea, but you really have to narrow it down and get rid of everything that doesn't contribute to the story itself.\" She learned quickly \u2014 and found she enjoyed telling everything from folk tales to experiences from her own life. \"I developed my own repertoire,\" she says. \"I started getting away from stories that were predictable. I realized people liked to be surprised.\" They do, agrees Warkentin. She considers herself more of a novice storyteller, although she's performed stage plays, is quick with a joke, and has always loved listening to stories. She realizes it's not as simple as many veteran tellers make it seem. In fact, she still remembers a night long ago, when she was in nursing school \u2014 she performed a monologue in front of an audience, and it fell flat. \"Oh, it was just terrible,\" she says, able to laugh about it now. She didn't get discouraged; instead she practiced and improved. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 51 Hayes feels like she's been telling stories all her life. \"I was the oldest of four, and my mother would often say, 'I have to make dinner \u2014 go amuse your siblings.' So I started making up things.\" She laughs. \"Now I've grown from being a big fat liar to a storyteller.\" Storytelling helps her hone her writing skills, she says, and keeps her imagination sharp. It also keeps her in touch with her audience. \"The stories I come away from feeling great about aren't always happy, or they aren't always funny,\" Hayes continues. \"They're the ones where I feel I've actually connected with the audience. A friend of mine gave me a wonderful quote, 'Remember that a story is one heart touching another.' I believe that; I truly do.\" Black agrees. She, too, has told stories all her life, and even taught corporate classes where she encouraged her participants to connect with others through storytelling. But she actually was introduced to the art when she was attending a different type of workshop \u2014 one for Celtic harpists. \"I play the Celtic harp, and I went to this workshop in Ontario,\" she recalls. \"You took four classes a day, and they only had three for the harp; the fourth was a storytelling class.\" She took it, told a story, and excelled. She was chosen to tell her story at a related festival that week. \"That was the first story I ever really told in front of so many people,\" she remembers with a laugh. \"I loved it; I loved the way people reacted. There's just something about being up on stage; something just happens. I came back to Ann Arbor and I realized I had to find (storytellers) here. And I got hooked up with the storytellers' guild.\" Preparing for the Big Moment Of course, no story will ever make it to the stage until the teller feels prepared enough \u2014 and brave enough \u2014 to get in front of an audience and share it. Judy Schmidt was a school librarian for 30 years and never had the desire to speak in front of a group. She was an avid reader, and she loved stories. But she didn't even like talking in front of a class. Until she took a storytelling workshop. Suddenly, that stage fright left her. \"... A friend of mine gave me a wonderful quote, 'Remember that a story is one heart touching another.' I believe that; I truly do.\" \u2014 Guild member Laura Lee Hayes Ann Arbor Storytellers' Guild The Ann Arbor Storytellers' Guild is a group of enthusiasts who support each other in a nurturing environment while encouraging the art of storytelling in the community. The guild, consisting of approximately 30 to 40 members, offers open meetings where the public is invited to tell stories, as well. \"Story Nights\" are held on the second Thursday of each month at Crazy Wisdom (except in the summer). At the end of the performance, audience members are invited to share a five-minute story. Regular Guild meetings are held on the fourth Sunday of every month from 2 to 4 p.m. at Nicola's books (except in the summer). The first hour is always devoted to open storytelling. Information on other storytelling sessions and special events can be found on the group's website: http://www.annarborstorytelling.org/AASG/Home.html Continued on page 52\"When you have a written work, it's just between you and the story.

Storytelling keeps you in the present; you're right there.\" \u2014 Guild member Beverly BlackFor instance, The MOTH, a well-known storytelling organization that holds events across the country, holds its storytellers to a five-minute time limit. Conversely, Going Deep: The Traditional Long Story Retreat , required its stories to be at least an hour long. Getting on stage can seem intimidating the first time, storytellers agree. But the end result is worth it \u2014 for both the teller and the listener. Ask Darryl Mickels, who not only loves telling stories, but enjoys listening to them, as well. \"With a story, there's no special effects \u2014 it's all in your mind,\" he says. \"And there's always a little bit of excitement to being up there ... sometimes you're sharing a deep emotion. But I love to kick back and listen to other stories, too. Even if I've heard it before, it seems like I always get something new out of it.\" Hayes encourages anyone who's interested to give it a try \u2014 even if they've never thought of themselves as a storyteller. She offers a little food for thought. \"If you think you've never told a story, consider this: Did you ever go anywhere and tell anyone about it? Ever have a little anecdote you've shared? Those are stories \u2014 they're all stories. And telling your stories and being heard is a wonderful experience.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 52 Storytelling Events Around the Community On February 21, The Ark in downtown Ann Arbor will hold its annual February Storytelling Festival, featuring nationally known storytellers.

I went to a class with Beverly (Black) and I've learned a lot listening to others in the guild. I tell a lot of personal stories, and when you craft a story from an anecdote and you gift an audience with it, there's something ... just satisfying about it.\" All storytellers prepare in different ways, they agree, and that preparation is essential. They type out notes, practice in front of others, or listen to themselves on tape. And if they're attending storytelling workshops or festivals, they keep in mind their venue \u2014 and rules that may go along with it.

Those students spend a week in September scattered across the area visiting, conversing, observing, and receiving treatments from holistic practitioners to learn about healthcare from their perspectives. I have been practicing massage, Trager\u00ae, and trauma healing work for 18 years. I am one of many practitioners hosting students that week. My visits are from 8:00 to 10:00 a.m., early hours for most students, and they often arrive groggy or flustered from dealing with traffic and unfamiliar directions. I typically host four students at a time, and I wait for all of them to arrive before beginning. We spend the first hour in discussion: What are the modalities I offer? Have they ever experienced any of them? What kind of healthcare and patients are they interested in? After that, some physical work: I give each of them a hands-on mini session of Trager\u00ae (movement reeducation work), offering gentle movement to the hands, feet, shoulders, or neck, and I have the group get up and do different movements, just as if I were doing a session with my clients. Nowadays, most students have had a massage of some sort, so we discuss the differences between massage and Trager\u00ae, and contextualize where each is more appropriate. I also explain trauma healing work. After their initial arrival, they relax in the dim room, and after receiving, they relax even more, their bodies getting lower in their chairs. Opening the Conversation When I first began practicing bodywork, connection between physicians and alternative practitioners was not common. At times, I felt that there were two systems running parallel to each other: conventional and holistic. When the U-M Medical School field visits became possible, I signed up, excited by the chance to begin building bridges between these two communities.I have always wondered what went on at U-M Medical School preceding and following these visits. Was there discussion? What effects did this have on their development as physicians? To answer my questions, I had several conversations with physicians who have been a part of this program. The first was with Dr. Sara Warber, one of the principal creators. Kirsten Mowrey: How did you create the field visit program for the medical students? Sara Warber: In 2001, we received a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which coincided with a time of curriculum revision at the Medical School. This gave us the money to hire curriculum experts for design, and both the associate and assistant dean, who were intimately involved in the grant process, wanted Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) as part of the curriculum. Kirsten Mowrey: What was the motivation behind creating the field visits?Sara Warber: We thought about what students knew and what we wanted them to know and came up with field visits as the best way to have a deeper understanding of CAM. The field visits occurred in a week where the curriculum was focused on patient care, with a lecture on CAM, a discussion group, and the field visits \u2014 not just to CAM practitioners but also to conventional medical practitioners' offices. It also included a conversation with a senior citizen. We wanted them to observe the doctor/patient relationship and think about how what they saw in alternative medicine was different from and similar to what they saw in conventional M.D. offices. We wanted students to understand why patients would choose CAM and how important that was. I felt strongly that students should have a basic ability to converse with patients \u2014 that to say \"I don't know about that, don't do it\" was unacceptable as a medical doctor. Physicians need to have the language and terminology to talk with their patients, to come from a compassionate stance instead of an authoritarian one. Kirsten Mowrey: Are there challenges associated with field visits? What happened when the grant finished? \"We thought about what students knew and what we wanted them to know and came up with field visits as the best way to have a deeper understanding of CAM. \" \u2014 D r. Sara Warber EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE: How University of Michigan Medical School is Training Its Students to Have a Deeper Understanding of Complementary and Alternative MedicineThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 55 Sara Warber: Regarding the logistical challenges, I know sometimes students were startled to be going to what looked like a home address and realizing that the buildings used [for care] may be different. The Medical School readily took on the expense after the grant because they felt it was successful and important information. I'm glad it's continuing. I remember, at the end of the patient care week, the students had a final with several essay options, one of which asked why patients chose CAM. Generally, more than half the class would choose to do that particular question, to put together all the information. Mowrey: You are currently not involved with the program, correct? Warber: Yes, I passed the medical student program on to Dr. Amy Locke.Mowrey: As you reflect back on your work with the Medical School, what stands out? Warber: I think that this work has contributed to an overall greater acceptance of CAM among young medical doctors \u2014 not just the University of Michigan. Twelve schools got grants to do this; it was an amazing investment on the part of the NIH. In all this, people like yourself, people who volunteered [to host the field visits], it was people who really made this alive and real. The set of resources we have in this community made this possible; we couldn't have done it if it was just academics [involved]. Mowrey: Thank you Sara, and best wishes.Back in my room, the students have reached the limits of their attention for this early hour and are losing focus. Then I announce that I will be working with a client for the last hour, and the students' attention sharpens. This is what they really have come for; this is the action, where it's all at. They lean forward, they wake up, stir themselves. The anticipation is palpable as they await the opening of the door and meeting my client. The Current Generation To understand where field visits stand now, I met with Dr. Amy Locke and Dr. Amanda Kaufman, who, at the time of our interview, co-directed this program for the Medical School. Since this interview occurred, Dr. Kaufman has left U-M and gone into private practice. Kirsten Mowrey: What brought each of you into integrative medicine?Amanda Kaufman: I graduated from the Med School in 2002. My residency was done in 2005. I joined the faculty in 2005. Amy Locke: Well, I went to medical school here at U-M and residency, and joined the faculty here in 2002. As a part of my medical school training, we had elective time available, and so I did some elective rotations with local integrative physicians. We also had a very active integrative medicine interest group at the time and so we brought in a lot of community practitioners to demonstrate what they do and to talk about their methods and the kinds of things they offer. That was very helpful. The Medical School didn't have a formal piece of their curriculum to expose all students [to CAM] then, but students who were interested would spend time. Kirsten Mowrey: So, the interest group was something you did beyond your regular curriculum? Amy Locke: Exactly, so at lunchtime, or on the weekend or evenings, we would do different activities.Kirsten Mowrey: Are there still those interest groups for students? Amy Locke: Yes, and I am the faculty advisor for the student interest group right now. Mowrey: And what is their particular focus?Locke: It really depends on the group of students. So if there is a particular interest in there for meditation or Reiki or herbs or acupuncture, whoever is leading it that year tends to use their own interests to explore different modalities. Mowrey: And what would you say interests you the most?Locke: I would say I am most interested in prevention, preventive medicine and lifestyle, so that you stay healthy and don't need to do lots of intervention. I would say I'm interested in nutrition as a primary basis for that. Amanda Kaufman: The mind body aspects, manual medicine, I love osteopathic manipulative therapy, and herbal products when they can be useful have been helpful. I would like to say I'm competent at homeopathics, but every time I feel like I know a little bit more, there's too much more to know. Mowrey: I'm curious, Dr. Locke, was your particular visit with an alternative practitioner around nutrition? Or that didn't exist at the time you went through the program? Locke: I don't think we had any visits with people around nutrition. I think that's something that I've just done a lot of reading and worked through continuing medical education courses to get more information about. Mowrey: Is part of what you offer at the Integrative Medicine Clinic training in that?Locke: Well, certainly we teach medical students in the Med School in the pre-clinical years, so for M1's and M2's, the first two years [of medical school], and then we have M3's and M4's who are in their clinical years who rotate with us at the [Integrative Medicine] Clinic. We also have residents who rotate through our clinic and then we lecture in the residency in Family Medicine and then we have a fellow who works full time at our clinic. So one of our docs each year is our fellow who comes for one year and, as a part of that year, they learn quite a bit about nutrition, as well as all sorts of other things. Mowrey: Is that something you brought in when you arrived in 2007?Locke: No, that was part of the clinic's inception, was the fellowship and the clinical practice. Mowrey: How actively involved with the M1's and M2's are you?Locke: We do a little bit, we give a lecture each fall to the M1's and M2's. There's a musculoskeletal sequence for the M1's where community practitioners come in. So they work with a chiropractor, an acupuncturist, and a massage therapist Dr. Amy Locke Dr. Amanda Kaufman Continued on page 56\"Physicians need to have the language and terminology to talk with their patients, to come from a compassionate stance instead of an authoritarian one. \" \u2014 Dr. Sara Warber \"Even the people who aren't particularly interested in integrative medicine, they have a baseline exposure to different kinds of practices, which is different from what it has been. \" - Dr. Amy Locke, on polling first year medical studentsDr. Kaufman is now working at Integrative Healthcare Providers in Ann Arbor. See page 16. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 56 to understand musculoskeletal from those viewpoints. And then the M1's do the community visit and that's about it. They have a mostly classroom-based education, with a couple of visits to see physicians in practice, and that coincides with their CAM visit week, and then they do a compare and contrast. Mowrey: So there is a meeting after their CAM visits to compare and contrast?Locke: Yeah, they meet in their small groups to debrief and they talk about what was it like for the patient who was sitting with the CAM practitioner, or the cardiologist, or M.D. they visited. Mowrey: They debrief in their small groups and then they write a paper?Locke: Yes, so they debrief and then they have an exam and they choose a certain number of questions and one of the questions is ours. So I have a stack of sixty [essays] and Mandy has another sixty to go through and comment on their visits. This year was the first time we tried to go through and figure out, when they are writing their essay, who they worked with. We have this huge list of practitioners, and sometimes we hear great things and sometimes we hear things that are concerning, but we haven't had a great way to link that back to the actual person. So I'm hoping that it will allow us to give feedback and make the experience more valuable. I would say the only complaint I've heard this year was some folks who went out and worked with a physical therapist group, that it wasn't alternative enough, they wanted more exposure. Amanda Kaufman: It is integrative, but they don't see it as integrative. Some of the rehab specialists we send people to, they [the students] were like, \"Well, I didn't have the experience my colleagues had.\" Mowrey: So that was one of my questions, because I've been a massage therapist for 18 years and I find it is very different now from when I began. Do you find there is a general knowledge base among medical students that is higher than there used to be, from when you went through school? Locke: You know, it's funny. So I give this lecture, and this year, I think it was the M1's, I just asked for a raise of hands as to who had tried this modality. And, you know, half the class's hands go up. So even the people who aren't particularly interested in integrative medicine, they have a baseline exposure to different kinds of practices, which is different from what it has been. Like massage therapy isn't very out there, so people don't think of that as, \"Ooooh I'm doing something kinda crazy,\" like they might if they were getting Reiki or acupuncture, although that's becoming more mainstream too. So I think it feels less fringy than it was. Mowrey: What modalities do you see as generally accepted now? You mention massage therapy and acupuncture, what about others? Locke: I think it depends on your population; in Ann Arbor chiropractic care is still considered a little bit edgy, but if you were in rural America, everybody's got a chiropractor. EXPANDING THE SCOPE \"When reflecting back on this past week's discussions and observations in addition to my own personal experiences with CAM, I believe that these alternative modalities deserve to have an important place in the Western medical world. I do not think that CAM by any means should replace biomedical therapies, but rather the methodologies should work in tandem to provide the most well rounded approach to healing a patient.... It is our responsibility as physicians to provide the best care possible that works with the lifestyle of our patients, and showing acceptance for treatments even outside our own belief demonstrates our commitment to serve the needs of our patients, which will ultimately strengthen the doctor-patient relationship. \" \u2014K atie Goldrath, M.D. Candidate, Class of 2017 \"I shadowed a D.O. with another student for three hours and was surprised it fell under CAM, as they learn a lot of the same things we do. We were 'flies on the wall' observing while they saw patients with a diversity of issues. I noticed they allowed for a lot more time spent with patients \u2014 one patient was about forty-five minutes to an hour \u2014 whereas doctors have more and more pressure due to reimbursement [to spend less]. They were very hesitant to prescribe prescription medication, preferring different supplements, minerals, and exercise. They used osteopathic manipulation where relevant and I didn't know much about that going into the visit. I think those who seek out alternative therapies don't want to add another scrip; it appeals to them to get treatment in another way. \u2014Anonymous M.D. Candidate, Class of 2017 \"I've had a pretty long standing interest in CAM and the more exposure I get, the more I want to make it a priority. I want to keep exposures going on and observing throughout medical school, it seems integral to maintaining my interest. The pressures physicians face, they end up working systematically and not necessarily creative approaches [get used]. \" \u2014S arah Bliss, M.D. Candidate, Class of 2017 \"Having a limited knowledge of acupuncture going into the visit, I was quite skeptical of its benefit. But, the two sessions that we were able to sit in on showed me how much it had done for the patients. Such Open Your Mind and Say \"Aah\" \"In Ann Arbor, chiropractic care is still considered a little bit edgy, but if you were in rural America, everybody's got a chiropractor. \" \u2014 Dr. Amy LockeContinued from page 55 \"I think that we are always apt to get complaints about those who go see our energy practitioners, Reiki or other, just because if they are not open, they can't see the healing there.

Mowrey: And what do you see as the fringe now?Kaufman: I think that we are always apt to get complaints about those who go see our energy practitioners, Reiki or other, just because if they are not open, they can't see the healing there. They are so used to this model of \"there's this drug and it does this\" that if you try to explain the healing from within or the person's self healing, they are just \"eh.\" Locke: A lot of people have trouble with energy work; it's harder to study, to get a good research base for those sorts of things. Depending on the group, homeopathy, sometimes; colonics; things where you look under a microscope and diagnose someone's whole body based on one drop of blood; I think those things are still kind of edgy. I think it really depends on whom you are talking to. Mowrey: So for energy workers, to be able to articulate what is happening would be very helpful for the student visits. positive results included an increase in energy, a drop in pain, and a decrease in the inflammation of certain areas. While I am not fully convinced about its direct effects myself, the patients definitely tell otherwise. \" \u2014 Anonymous M.D. Candidate, Class of 2017 \"It is amazing how something so simple can relieve so many symptoms in such a short period of time. It is a shame that insurance companies rarely cover such treatments, since it seems as though the addition of regular therapeutic massage to a pain or anxiety regimen could have extremely positive effects for patients. Instead, for the most part, only those who can afford the extra cost are able to obtain treatment from these massage therapists. As a physician I think it will be important to understand the benefits of complementary medicine and have a working knowledge of the evidence for and against specific complementary therapies. This would allow me to act as a valuable resource for patients deciding whether the out-of-pocket costs of a given treatment are worth it. \" \u2014 Anonymous M.D. Candidate, Class of 2017 \"I see nothing wrong with using energy healing for relaxing or spiritual purposes, but I am nervous about people who are overly confident in the practice and how that could influence the management of their care. \" \u2014 Anonymous M.D. Candidate, Class of 2017 \"After the visit, I realized that energy healing could have some serious effects on people suffering from serious illnesses. Even though I was still not sure whether this form of healing would have an effect on my mental and physical state, I was able to appreciate the tremendous impact it leaves on many people coming for help. It would be a significant technique to integrate into clinical practice to improve outcomes of overall treatment of patients. \" \u2014 Anonymous M.D. Candidate, Class of 2017 \"The afternoon was much more substantive than I expected. The practitioner walked my partner and me through the anatomy and physiology of the muscles she would be working on, described the benefits of massage in a medical context, and related her work to material we have studied so far. I was struck by her presentation of massage therapy as integrating aspects of medicine and physical therapy. \" \u2014Anonymous M.D. Candidate, Class of 2017 \"As someone who has received relaxation massages, I was not expecting to be so impressed with her techniques. She did a great job of explaining why she was doing something before she did it, and I immediately felt the effects of the massage. \" \u2014 Anonymous M.D. Candidate, Class of 2017 \" ...Every experience where they understand a patient's perspective is helping them to be better....

Maybe dumbed down for the medical students, rather than the medical students hearing that they are connecting the energy. One student complained that they got told that the practitioner was connecting the energy from the core of the earth or the universe, and, of course, the medical student just shut down. Locke: But I think that's good to bring that back to the group and talk about.Mowrey: Amazing discussions!Kaufman: The layer that we have no control over is that we are not in charge of who discusses this in their small groups. Locke: It's a physician who leads them through their whole curriculum. If the person who leads that group is into integrative medicine, that's great. If not, it's through their filter. We used to do this discussion co-led with a CAM practitioner and a physician. They stopped doing that a couple of years ago. I'm not sure of all the details behind it. Mowrey: How do students feel about that week of visits to alternative practitioners?Kaufman: In general, it's very positive. They are hungry to understand what the patient's experience is, both in conventional medicine and other venues. I think that the feedback I get from them is that every experience where they understand a patient's perspective is helping them to be better, to guide people better, to know what they are going through. It's a leap for them to understand where a patient is coming from. They are still very new. Locke: At that point they don't know much about clinical medicine, so they focus more on interpersonal skills: how did the patient feel listened to, more of that \"how do you be a provider\" kind of thing rather than \"they prescribed XYZ treatment or therapy.\" Mowrey: Have any students reported a change in mindset or viewpoint based on their visits? Locke: I feel like reading the essays last year was really educational for me because they made all kinds of comments about changing in perception and it not being what they expected. Really a lot of comments around the humanism; [that] the patient felt listened to in a way that they maybe didn't [feel listened to] by the M.D. Really being listened to and respected. And it being a very comfortable environment, versus a very sterile environment. Kaufman: A very healing environment. They mention objective facts, like integrative practitioners spend more time [with patients]; a massage therapist is going to spend more time than seven minutes. Mowrey: I saw on the website that all medical students have to go through this. I believe you said there are 170 medical students. As for participating practitioners, the website says you have over 200?Locke: It is hard to find that many people. That is a lot of people, and Washtenaw County is big, but it's not that big (laughs). Mowrey: So you stay within the county? You don't go up to Brighton?Locke: Sometimes we do, but they don't all have cars. We try to keep them as close as possible, just for transportation issues. Kaufman: Amy and I have tried really hard to send students who are going to be engaged; try harder to get them to do their pre-reading [of materials practitioners send before the visit], emphasizing their job is to be professional and respectful so people don't accidentally get turned off. In my experience with doctors, there are some who have really good people skills and there are some that don't have the best people skills, and the same carries through with students. I want as little as possible for one student to turn off one of our volunteer practitioners. Locke: We've had experiences where we've sent students and we've heard back from the practitioner that they don't want to do this anymore [because of students] leaving their blank face or making their snarky comment. I tell the students, it's not whether you believe in what the person is doing or not... Kaufman: They are volunteering! Locke: ...it's still a valuable experience. They have this pedestal thing going with the M.D. faculty, but when they are going to their CAM visit, they get kind of touchy. This is a good time to practice respect and learning outside of your own paradigm. Mowrey: Well, you never know who your patient is going to present you with!Kaufman: That's the other huge eye-opening part that comes through in their essays; patients are not cookie cutter two-dimensional humans with whom you are going to assess the situation and answer multiple-choice questions. They are diverse in their thinking, and whatever that client thinks is going to heal them, the power of their paradigm, probably will. Mowrey: Who oversees quality control for the selection of CAM practitioners?Locke: We use practitioners that we know or know of by recommendation. We will drop practitioners for future years if there are problems identified. We want the students to have a positive experience. Mandy and I work with Joyce [ Kiger, administrator for the medical students] to choose practitioners each year. Many, if not most, of the practitioners are known by someone affiliated with Integrative Medicine at U-M and come by recommendation. These relationships have been built over many years in many formats: met in person in any number of settings, shared patients, and so on. Mowrey: You mention dropping practitioners. What type of problems have you identified? Locke: I don't know of anyone off hand that we have chosen not to use again. Obviously, some have moved or changed their practice such that we don't send The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 59 \"That's the other huge eye-opening part that comes through in their essays; [they realize] patients are not cookie cutter two-dimensional humans.... They are diverse in their thinking, and whatever that client thinks is going to heal them, the power of their paradigm, probably will. \" \u2014 Dr. Amanda Kaufmanstudents anymore. Some haven't been deemed \"alternative enough,\" like last year when we sent several students to a rehab facility. It seems like occasionally a student identified not feeling welcome. Mowrey: Are there specific CAM practitioners that you would like to add?Kaufman: It would be nice if most of the groups had someone in their group who had a visit with an alternative practitioner: a chiropractor, an acupuncturist, an energy worker. It's been very hard logistically to make that happen. Locke: People who want to work with students and share what they do. Kaufman: Enthusiasm. Locke: At this point, I don't think there's a kind of practitioner we would say no to. I think it's more about interpersonal skills. Kaufman: And letting the students see actual patients. Mowrey: Are there still elements in the medical school strongly opposed to the one- week CAM visits? How is CAM received by other faculty? Locke: I don't know of anyone strongly opposed, but Joyce might know better. My impression is that the visit is well received. There seems to be a gradual increase in support at the med school level, including faculty. [Joyce Kiger via email: \"There are individuals (both students and faculty) who aren't overly receptive to CAM but I believe the numbers are declining. The field visits are very well received by the students.\"] Mowrey: What are your future goals for this program with the medical students?Kaufman: Right now, we still have a lot of work on \"buy in\" with our volunteer practitioners, and working with the really tight time constraints the medical school gives us. Locke: Look for ways to thank people. You want people to feel like they are making a difference, because it's a hassle to take time out of your day to meet with students, and if you don't feel appreciated, why would you add it? The gift of time, everyone is busy, everyone has things to do, so, giving the gift of time is to be acknowledged. Mowrey: What would be your hopes for the students at the end of it? Multiple visits? Locke: What would be really great would be to have an opportunity for those who were interested in more elective type opportunities \u2014 [for the student who says,] \"Oh, if only I could have seen this type of person or been able to compare [modalities]\" \u2014 to have a list of practitioners, if you have a student who is interested in this, [that a student could] call. Kaufman: There's about 10-15 percent who would be really interested in more time, and it's such a great space in their learning to have their minds opened.Mowrey: Thank you so much for meeting with me today, and good luck! The Expanded Scope Back at my field visit, the door opens, my client enters, and the last hour flies by. In preparation for this moment, I have discussed and received permission from my client to talk about the care they have received, their past and current condition, and openly discussed any health information. Every year I do this, my client is eager to talk to the students, to answer their questions and to be listened to by conventional medical practitioners. Clients are so willing to share their stories, the details of their care, the decisions carefully weighed. When they are on the table they will often take students' hands and place them where mine were, urging the students to feel the difference in the tissue. They may say, \"No, lighter; she was touching lighter, she was using her hand this way, that direction; do you notice this here?\" \u2014 teaching the students through direct feedback. I watch each of the students interact with my client, respond to the directness and immediacy of the experience, their frustration when they don't know how to use their hands, their wonder when they feel the change in the joint or the limb from how it felt before. I observe each of them struggle with their learning edge \u2014 for some it is understanding what my client means, for others it is learning to use their hands as sensory devices, to learn information kinesthetically, not cognitively. They are profuse in their thanks to my client when they depart. As we do a final roundup, I see an openness in their faces, an awareness of people learning together how to help each other. I wish them all well as they depart on their journey back to the medical school, hoping that my client and I have planted a seed that will grow as they learn. *** Kirsten Mowrey is a Licensed Massage Therapist, Trager\u00ae practitioner, and trauma healing therapist with 18 years of experience as a bodyworker.

So do my colleagues at the Ecology Center, and this is why we are working with the Ann Arbor Housing Commission (AAHC) to develop innovative solutions to make public housing \"greener,\" healthier, more comfortable and energy efficient, and more affordable. We're collaborating with the AAHC and Norstar Development on a new affordable housing project that models green and healthy residential construction. When complete, our Green and Healthy Housing project should lower utility costs and improve the quality of life for residents. Earlier this year, planning and design began on the AAHC's North Maple Estates site, where 19 single-family detached units will be replaced by 42 units of attached-style townhouses. The increase in the number of units is significant because the AAHC's waiting list has more than 500 families in need of housing. The North Maple project is anticipated to be completed in mid-2016. Our main goals are to maximize energy efficiency; reduce or eliminate toxic chemicals from the buildings; and use more durable materials that reduce operating costs and promote resource conservation. Energy costs are a very large burden for the AAHC's residents: low-income households pay a much larger share of their discretionary income on utilities than average households. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, low income households spend 17 percent of their total housing budget on energy \u2014 more than four times the average household. To maximize our impact, we'll not only be providing more efficient homes, but we'll also be reaching out to residents about ways they can get the most out of their energy use. But the benefits of the project could go much further, demonstrating the value of good affordable housing to the community as a whole. Communities across the Midwest face significant shortages of affordable housing. Locally, the story is the same: the demand far exceeds the supply. The AAHC had 15,000 households sign up in 2012, and have only been able to provide housing for less than 100 of these households in the past two years. Almost three years ago, I first collaborated with Jennifer Hall, the visionary and pragmatic executive director of the AAHC, to evaluate the energy performance of AAHC's buildings. Starting with existing housing stock is an essential strategy for long-term preservation of affordable housing. With support from HUD, we prioritized capital improvements that would reduce energy consumption for both the AAHC and their tenants. As an architect and sustainability geek, evaluating the AAHC's housing stock raised big questions. Could we afford to propose slightly more expensive healthy materials and high efficiency equipment when roofs, windows, and doors \u2014 fundamental to shelter itself \u2014 desperately needed to be replaced? The simple fact is that, despite obvious energy efficiency opportunities, the AAHC cannot raise rents to cover increased cost of repairs. Now, after years of persistent work and relentless advocacy from Jennifer and her staff, the AAHC has identified both funding and a developer to retrofit and rebuild their entire portfolio of buildings, and development and design on the North Maple Estates site has begun. With this project underway, the real question is, how do we replicate it and develop more sustainable public housing on limited budgets? The agencies that fund affordable housing need to understand what front-end investments will yield long-term savings and benefits. One reason so many affordable housing projects look cheap and deteriorate rapidly is that green and healthy investments face competing interests of getting more people housed, and making sure the buildings last over the long-term. While a natural product like wood flooring is more expensive (as well as durable and less toxic) than vinyl, vinyl is considerably cheaper. The average American spends about 90 percent of his or her life indoors, so the materials we use to construct homes have ripple effects related to disease and chronic health conditions. Greener homes also contribute to a community's resilience to climate change, yet green building investments are rarely directed to By Jason Bing Building a Healthy Foundation for Affordable Housing in Ann Arbor GREEN LIVING Communities across the Midwest face significant shortages of affordable housing. Locally, the story is the same: the demand far exceeds the supply. The AAHC had 15,000 households sign up in 2012, and have only been able to provide housing for less than 100 of these households in the past two years. For me, it is apparent that creating replicable solutions so that all affordable housing is rebuilt to be green and healthy is fundamental to furthering social and environmental justice in our community. The tenants experience many of these benefits. The financial benefits ... are vast. Equally invaluable, though, are the health, safety, and comfort benefits. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 61 low-income housing. For me, it is apparent that creating replicable solutions so that all affordable housing is rebuilt to be green and healthy is fundamental to furthering social and environmental justice in our community. That's why one focus of our Green and Healthy Housing project is to develop a set of principles that considers local needs and helps prioritize decisions. For instance, we all agree that proper insulation is a high priority. But we had to assess whether to use recycled cotton, cellulose, or polyurethane foam based on cost, durability, energy performance, and place of manufacture. As a way of organizing our design process, we created the following guiding principles: 1. Utilize Cost-Effective Energy Solutions 2. Choose Durable Materials 3. Eliminate or Substantially Reduce Toxicity 4. Education is a Key to Success 5. \"Push the Envelope\" on Green These principles are the project's framework, allowing the entire project team to focus our limited resources on what's best for the AAHC. I'm particularly enthusiastic about the emphasis on energy solutions, and here's why: new research is supporting earlier findings that the benefits of energy efficiency investments (our first priority) extend far beyond utility bill impacts. More and more studies outline the \"non-energy\" benefits of efficiency measures, whose beneficiaries include owners, tenants, utility companies, and communities/society. The tenants experience many of these benefits. The financial benefits \u2014 decreased financial stress, reduced exposure to rising energy costs, and increased cash for rent, education, food, and medical expenses \u2014 are vast. Equally invaluable, though, are the health, safety, and comfort benefits. Improved ventilation and climate control has been shown to reduce cardiac and pulmonary ailments caused by poor indoor air quality, including asthma. The potential for reducing childhood asthma is truly exciting \u2014 it has a direct impact on educational achievement, especially among low-income school-age children. Asthma disproportionately affects lower-income households, and particularly people of color. In 2010, there were approximately 640,000 emergency room visits due to asthma for children under the age of 15. Asthma is a leading cause of school absenteeism, and accounts for an estimated 14.4 million lost school days per year. Broader community engagement is critical to the success of this project. That's why this project's community-based philosophy fosters participation from many diverse partners and stakeholders, especially the residents. We've partnered with the Arts Alliance to create educational public art, and we're working with the Peace Neighborhood Center to host hands-on educational events (including a green building design class for middle school students). Most recently, we have engaged a class of Skyline High seniors to produce green and healthy educational videos, in addition to consulting with students from the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business to develop a model for a community-based solar power project. It truly takes a village. If we believe in sustainable and climate resilient communities, we need to recognize subsidized affordable housing as a critical component of our city. Community housing investments save money, create local jobs, protect the health of at-risk families, reduce health-care costs, build community, and increase local climate resilience. These developments are physical representations of our core values as a community. If we have the technical capacity to build healthy, safe, and comfortable housing with dramatically reduced operating costs, why wouldn't we?

She was ordained as a Dharma teacher in 1984 and as a Buddhist priest in 1993. She hails from Vancouver, British Columbia, where she was born in 1944. In her early 30's, she lived in Toronto, where she unwittingly joined the avant-garde of her generation, taking yoga classes and seeking new paths. In 1977, she discovered zen/seon meditation, or \"sitting\" as it was called by the Toronto-based, Korean priest, Samu Sunim, who introduced her to it and took her under wing. She was 33 years old. Under his tutelage, she was drawn into Buddhist practice. He gave her the name Haju Sunim. She explained that the name Haju means \"to hold a place\" or \"beyond wisdom.\" \"Sunim\" is a Korean honorific for all Buddhist monks, male or female. It is, she said, an egalitarian title. The Ann Arbor Zen Buddhist Temple on Packard and Wells is known to most Ann Arborites for its distinctive, dun-hued, brick wall with the hand-written sign: \"Ann Arbor Zen Buddhist Temple.\" The wall hides a typical Burns Park home, purchased by the group in 1982. Two years later, the community began renovations. According to those who took part, the work was exhilarating. Skilled work was contracted out, but community members did most of the grunt work. They built the brick wall along the street. They tore down walls inside. The ground floor's enlarged rooms are used for lectures, worship, and meditation. The third floor is a multipurpose yoga studio. The second floor holds a lounge and several bedrooms. When the group acquired the building next door at 1224 Packard, formerly a bike shop and previous to that a grocery and drug store with a soda fountain, they dug two tunnels underneath the building for steel beams to be installed to support the floor. It was a mighty effort. They also hauled bricks, dug trenches, filled dumpsters, made trips to the landfill, brainstormed, and fundraised. This building is now known as Sangha Hall. (Sangha means followers of Buddha.)

She was 33 years old. ...Haju means \"to hold a place\" or \"beyond wisdom.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 63 structure campus hidden behind the outside wall. The smallest structure is the hermitage, where Haju resides. In the outdoor space between the structures, the group planted a vegetable garden. It provides some of the vegetarian fare that fuels the followers. The Buddhist life that Haju has chosen is built on a back-to-nature, self-reliant approach to living. Self-empowerment, she said, allows for greater faith in one's awakening. She cites the Buddha's injunction: \"Be a lamp unto yourself,\" explaining that in Buddhism, \"everyone is Buddha.\" Each person has the capacity and obligation to be awakened and to stay awake. \"Faith,\" she said, \"is coming to know that for yourself.\" The result is self-empowerment, which allows for greater faith. Haju Sunim's responsibilities at the temple involve teaching, guiding meditations, leading prayer services, and conducting weddings \u2014 an office she relishes. \"I've done weddings at the Huron River, restaurants, backyards, and with other religious leaders, including priests and rabbis.\" Each day begins with 108 prostrations before the meditation. The regimen is a reminder that our lives are a confluence of mind, body, spirit. Prostrations follow a fixed sequence. Haju demonstrated the regimen as we sat chatting in a room on the temple's main floor. She lowered herself to the floor and began an elaborate sequence of choreographed movements. Bows and genuflections, done in quick succession, required stamina and agility. As part of the morning rituals, each worshipper does a set number of prostrations, then shouts out a verse. After 25 prostrations, the verse is: \"Great is the matter of birth death.\" After \"Impermanence surrounds 100: \"Do waste your life.\" These verses are called Gathas (GAH-tuhs). People seeking to become Buddhists are asked to do 3,000 prostrations. She explained: \"The first thousand are to make amends for the past. The second thousand are to forgive those who have offended us. The third thousand confirm the commitment to be helpful to others.\"Until she became a Buddhist, Haju Sunim was known as Linda Hadfield n\u00e9e Murray. She grew up in Vancouver, British Columbia in a small fishing village by the Fraser River that was once a village of Japanese fishermen. She attended her mother's Anglican Church. During the Second World War, when the Canadian government dubbed its Japanese residents \"enemy aliens\" and forced them into internment camps, the Murray family became squatters in one of the empty houses. Haju's father fished. Her mother mended nets. When the salmon were not running, he landscaped. Haju remembers bright red roses outside the front of their small green-shingled house. In winter, the family sold Christmas trees. Eventually they bought a home of their own. It had \"plenty of acreage.\" Her father \"loved to grow things.\" Of necessity, the family was frugal. They shared the values of the village, which featured a communal bath. Her parents' work ethic ingrained itself in their daughter. She taught Sunday school and became a youth leader in her mother's church. At the University of British Columbia, she studied English and history, took teachers' training, and then taught elementary school. Eventually, she taught in innovative schools and worked with teachers on what she called \"cutting-edge education.\" Her perspective was further broadened as an associate faculty member at Simon Fraser University's School of Education. SFU is located on scenic Burnaby Mountain near Vancouver. After her very first year of teaching, at age 23, she married an accountant. He was soon promoted, which prompted their move to Toronto. She continued to work, but she also became a regular client of Vidal Sassoon hairdressers. \"It was a different lifestyle from what I'd been used to,\" she added, articulating the obvious. For a while, she worked for Interval, a day program for kids who couldn't hack it in regular schools. The work was gratifying. When an outsider, someone trained in special education, moved in, she moved on. She taught English as a second language. Somewhere during these career moves, she fell in love with another man, a yoga classmate. He was a Detroit native who had played football in college. She left her husband. After six years of marriage, her departure was, she said, \"unceremonious.\" She later regretted the hurt she caused him, but she needed a new direction. She and her new partner lived for a while in a yoga center. Both became certified yoga instructors. In 1999, after her years of training and temple service, she received the capability to teach Dharma from Ven. Samu Sunim. In Buddhist vernacular, this is known as \"receiving Dharma transmission.\" The Sanskrit Dharma, a key concept in Buddhism, is sometimes translated as \"disambiguation,\" to reflect the Buddha's emphasis on clarity, on being awake to the world and to oneself. Dharma also refers to a sense of cosmic law and order. Sometimes it's described as simply \"phenomena.\" Receiving Dharma transmission also means becoming part of the Buddha's spiritual bloodline; joining the lineage, the unbroken chain of succession. \"I rely more on who I really am. Maybe it's all about unwitting authenticity.\" She emphasized that every moment is informed by previous moments of her life.

The Ann Arbor Zen Buddhist Temple on Packard and Wells is known to most Ann Arborites for its distinctive, dun-hued, brick wall with the hand-written sign: \"Ann Arbor Zen Buddhist Temple.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 66 Members of the Zen Community on Zen Meditation and Daily Life To gain insight into how Zen practice impacts daily life, we asked eight Zen Temple practitioners, each in different stages of his or her meditation practice, the following questions: 1) How long have you been practicing Zen Meditation? 2) How does your involvement or meditation practice at the Zen Temple show up in your daily life? Tongsan Catherine Brown Since 1996 Daily meditation practice reminds me that a place of quiet happiness is always available to me. All I have to do is remember to go there. Daily meditation practice helps me tell the difference between the stories I tell myself and things as they really are. Daily meditation practice, by making me aware of my own stories, plants the seeds of compassion for others \u2014 who are, like me, trying to make sense of the world. Hayeon Kelli Conlin I have been practicing meditation for two years, since I enrolled in an introduction to meditation course at the Zen Buddhist Temple. Before that, the closest I came to meditation was sitting in the middle seat on a crowded airplane. I have come to understand that the value of our practice to our lives increases as we try to immerse our practice into everything we do, not just when we're sitting in meditation. I own and run Fluffy Bottom Farm and Upaya Creamery, located just west of Ann Arbor, where we raise dairy sheep and Jersey cows, and produce limited-supply, artisan yogurt and cheeses. My practice, along with all that I have learned from Haju at the Temple, has helped me to produce yogurts and cheeses in a mindful way. It brings together the contentment of our animals, the skillful means of those of us who milk the animals and make our products, and the health and joy of our clients who, we hope, experience that mindfulness themselves when they taste our cheeses and yogurts. Maum Gloria Co x 10 years Meditation practice has a greater range of benefits that I initially envisioned. Living a more mindful life means becoming a better person ... being more focused at work, being more available to those who need my help, appreciating opportunities and challenges as they arise, and continuing to grow a little more every day. Omyo Emily Howard Two and a half years The people at the temple and the practices I've learned there have really changed my life from inside out. I'm more stable and no longer need to act on the first thing that pops into my mind. This means I can better dedicate myself to my work, even when it's emotionally difficult, be more attentive to other people, and be more careful about how I use natural resources. Haru Sarah Juster Three years The Dalai Lama said, \"The most important thing is practice in our daily lives. Then you can know gradually the true value of religion.\" I can feel the effects of daily meditation, study, work, chanting, and prostration practice in my life. Sometimes I am working on a project in the Temple, like winterizing the windows, and suddenly I remember to stop and feel my meditation practice in my body. It brings warmth and joy and a sense of deep contentment. When I take a walk each day I feel sheer joy of the outdoors in seeing the bark on trees, the cool air in my face and staying connected to my own breath and my feet touching the earth. I notice changes in myself and others within our community as we learn to harmonize and become more loving and aware towards one another. I feel that in myself anxiety, tension, and worry are lessening as gratitude and contentment grow, but not without the hard work of daily practice and patienc Amoha Steve Marenghi I took the Lay Buddhist precepts in 1987 here at the Zen Buddhist Temple, and I practiced where I could while living in California and North Carolina, but it has only been one year and five months that I've been practicing formally while living at the Temple. The intensity of meditation practice and chanting here at the Temple has given me a stronger focus, a feeling of inner peace and outer awareness to process selflessly the positive and negative areas in my life. Nick McAllister I have been practicing Zen Meditation for around three months now. There is a certain \"calmness\" and \"stillness\" that thrives throughout my day due to my practice. Kogi Jennifer Ratliff-Moss I have been practicing Zen Meditation for 21 years. I am happier as a person. As I become more aware of the present moment and attuned to details, I enjoy more individual moments in my life. We also practice as a family. The other day my 12-year-old son noticed that I was feeling stressed about trying to get out the door when we were already late. Rather than reacting to my stress, he responded by presenting me with a flower that he had made from his two hands separating in a very gentle way. This gift, formed by his attentive presence, allowed me to immediately calm down and we both laughed, thus transforming the situation. We were still late, but no longer stressed about it. It was so quick. Zen practice has taught us how to do this.

The acolyte asked: \u2014 Are you a god?\u2014 Are you an angel? \u2014 Are you a saint? \u2014 No, no, no. \u2014 What are you?\u2014 I'm a human being, and I'm awake. Haju and her new partner lived, for a time, in a rented apartment across the street from the Toronto Buddhist Temple. Eventually, they scraped together the funds to buy a \"seedy flophouse,\" which they overhauled themselves. For Haju, this was good preparation for the renovations to come at Ann Arbor's Zen Buddhist Temple. They became students of the Toronto temple's resident priest, Ven. Samu Sunim. He had introduced her to meditation. He became her husband's teacher, too, and he married them in a Buddhist ceremony. When her first daughter was born, Samu Sunim came over to cut the umbilical cord. He also named the baby. The Korean \"Karima\" (the K is pronounced as G) means middle way and the ability to please oneself. Several years later, he named Karima's little sister Komani, which means \"enough.\" Haju soon recognized that with that name, her teacher was telling her that two children were enough. Haju re-interpreted the name to mean \"good enough.\" She wanted to be sure her daughter knew that one need not aim for perfection. Under the tutelage of Samu Sunim, Haju and her husband received priestly ordination. Haju's mother, still in Canada, had long since decided that her daughter had joined a cult. She worried about her granddaughters being raised as Buddhists. Initially, she was alarmed when her daughter started doing yoga. Haju's meditation and Buddhist practice increased her mother's fears. In 1981, when Haju was invited to join a pilgrimage to Korea, her mother's concerns deepened. For Haju, it was the opportunity of a lifetime, especially since a friend offered to help care for two-year-old Karima. But travel expenses were prohibitive. Haju's mother, widowed at age 56, In 1999, after her years of training and temple service, she received the capability to teach Dharma from Ven. Samu Sunim.Continued from page 63 Continued on page 68 Holistic Law The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 68 had come into money by remarrying a man of means. Haju turned to her mother for financial help. She said no. Haju asked her brother, then her sister for help. Each declined. In Haju's words, \"everyone was suspicious.\" Finally, a member of the community stepped forward to cover her expenses. Haju left for three months. Haju speaks of her trip to Korea as a \"defining event.\" The group, consisting of three men and two women, meditated, traveled, and learned together. Sundry others joined them for brief periods. They rose at 3 a.m. in the mountains and 4 a.m. in the cities to begin the day in meditation. They visited many temples, including some on mountaintops. It took spunk, determination, and stamina to reach certain destinations. She described the experience of doing 3,000 prostrations, a prerequisite for seeing Ven. Song-chol, Patriarch of the Korean Chogye Buddhist order. The men did their prostrations in the mountaintop hermitage. The women, prohibited from joining the men for this ritual, did their prostrations near the foot of the mountain. It took the women ten hours to complete the task. The men took longer. Haju recalled that, as darkness fell, she needed a bathroom. Her legs were so sore from the prostrations that she crawled down the stairs to the fancy, tile-roof outhouse, which bore a Korean sign. With a smile, she offered its English translation, \"Pavilion for relieving anxiety.\" After her pilgrimage, the Ann Arbor Zen Buddhist Temple beckoned. Haju's husband moved to Ann Arbor first. A few months later, Haju and the children joined him. Before long, he left to take a position at a Buddhist temple in Detroit. She assumed the priestly duties at the Ann Arbor temple. The marriage ended. After 35 years at the Ann Arbor Zen Buddhist Temple, Haju Sunim is central to this Buddhist community. Last January, when she turned 70, her community celebrated by throwing a surprise party. The Friday of her birthday weekend, she was immersed in curriculum preparation when the doorbell rang. Reluctantly, she set aside her work to answer the door. There stood both of her daughters with her grandchildren. She was astonished. They live in New England. Typically, they return to Ann Arbor each May, for the Buddha's Birthday Celebration. The daughters no longer consider themselves Buddhists, but they still consider May the time for family to gather and celebrate. For Haju's birthday, people came from around the world. Children and grandchildren and members and friends of the temple since the early days and up to the present attended, about 80 in all. Many knew Haju from the temple's Peace Camp, an annual, six-day retreat on Friends Lake Community on Long Lake in Chelsea. Peace Camp draws people from Korea, Chicago, Arizona, Mexico, Florida, Ohio, and many parts of Michigan. Haju relishes Peace Camp. For many years, she was camp director. Last year the temple celebrated the 30 th anniversary of the camp, which started with a little morning camp in the backyard of the temple on Packard. Haju's birthday weekend featured original music, poetry, and skits. There was worship, ritual, and communal chanting. The weekend event was a family and community celebration. There were lectures and workshops, just as there are at Peace Camp. Haju pointed out that many of the Peace Camp activities have rippled out to the larger community. Temple outreach includes work in prisons, where members teach meditation and Buddhist philosophy. Haju Sunim looks younger than her years. Small-boned and slender, she keeps her hair closely cropped, dresses in simple and classic \u2014 if somewhat shapeless \u2014 garb, and remains limber. During our first interview, she easily assumed a lotus position on the couch in front of me in the small lounge area on the second floor. We sipped ginger tea and munched dried mushrooms. Her drawstring pants and cross-collar tunic were grey, the standard priestly hue of Buddhist garb in Korea, the source of the tradition she perpetuates. (Elsewhere in the Buddhist world, monks wear saffron colored robes. In Tibet, they wear maroon; in Japan, black.) Her cotton trousers were neatly patched with solid color blocks of fabric. Her daily prostrations, and she does many each day, take a toll on the knees. She has repeatedly reinforced those areas of her pants. Discussion of her garb brought back memories of her meeting with Ven. Su'un Chul Sunim in Korea. \"He wore the kind of clothes I'm wearing now,\" she said. \"He patched his pants himself.\" Patching is pulsa , work done with the hands. Such activity, which includes making kimchi for the group, or sewing mats and cushions for meditation, is valued in Buddhist life. It supports the principle of self-help. For Haju, Buddhism represents a way to put theory into action. She is drawn to the integrity of its lifestyle. For her, living simply in a community of people who work together is key to fulfillment. She noted the words of Margaret Mead: \"It's amazing what a small group of dedicated people can be.\" Haju added: \"Voluntary simplicity is the essence of the Buddhist ethic.\" In Haju's experience, Buddhism also offers women more meaningful participation. \"In the Anglican Church,\" she said, \"I didn't have a position, as I did being a cook in the temple. I feel more connected when I'm down on the floor with others, or in the garden. It's important in our culture, because we are so disembodied.\" She dismisses \"all these hand-held devices\" in Western culture. She finds meaning in physical labor, working with others to build community, reaching out, and nurturing a spirit wherein people help one another. She mentioned Gary Snyder, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, essayist, environmentalist, activist, and translator of Japanese and ancient Chinese writings. In his best known work, The Practice of the Wild (North Point Press, 1990), he echoed the Buddha by writing: \"We must try to live without causing unnecessary harm, not just to fellow humans, but to all beings.\" I asked Haju about celibacy, having read about Buddhist monks and nuns who take such vows. She responded that in certain orders, including Haju's Buddhist Society for Compassionate Wisdom, celibacy is not required. In most orders, however, celibacy is required for monks and nuns. In this sense, Haju's North American Buddhist order is a departure from traditional renunciation practices. \"Buddha left his wife, child, and palace and became a Bikku, a monk,\" Haju explained. \"He was called the great renunciate.\" For Haju, who raised two children as a single mother, who has experienced both physical and spiritual passion, and who continues to reach out to many well beyond the temple compound, the kind of renunciation begot by simple living has been a path to fulfillment. \"I feel more connected when I'm down on the floor with others, or in the garden. It's important in our culture, because we are so disembodied.\" -Rev. Haju SunimPeople apply [to the Visitors Program] for the privilege of residing in the temple and becoming participants in daily, communal Buddhist practice. Haju's mother, still in Canada, had long since decided that her daughter had joined a cult. She worried about her granddaughters being raised as Buddhists. Continued from page 67Haju Sunim \u2014 and the Zen Buddhist TempleThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 69 Haju explained the Visitors Program to me. People apply for the privilege of residing in the temple and becoming participants in daily, communal Buddhist practice. Those accepted into the program occupy the bedrooms on the temple's second floor. Each offers a donation to the temple each month, shares in the preparation of communal meals, tends the garden, and helps run the temple's programs. As Haju and I sat together in one of the temple's main rooms, Sarah, a resident member of the Visitors Program, brought us a pot of tea and a bowl of dried apple slices. Sarah has been studying beekeeping. At the time of this writing, she expected delivery of her first hives any day. The bees will contribute to the garden's health and provide homegrown honey. Haju reached for her \"gratitude throw,\" which she had placed nearby. She wanted to show me this tangible result of pulsa : a patchwork quilt made of colorful fragments of old sweaters. It was a gift from Sanha, the temple priest in Toronto. Haju said: \"Each of us is patched together in a beautiful way. There's nothing that originates in us. I'm a patchwork person.\" Asked about her future, Haju responded that she hopes the community will find a way to support her in her old age. \"I don't see myself apart from what's going on at the temple,\" she said. At the same time, she knows that her daughters would welcome her with open arms. \"At this point in my life, I'm learning to be someone else,\" she said. \"I'm letting it go. It's hard to see myself not doing what I've always been doing.\" She says she is learning to grow old gracefully, to let others take on leadership and responsibility. Part of that process is training others and learning to trust. Haju talked about her connections with other people. For her, connecting with people is key to a meaningful life. At the temple, where she still works in the garden and even cleans toilets from time to time, such connections are built into daily routine. When she was younger, she said, she protected herself with a certain guarded distance from people. But in this time of life, no matter what the setting, she is simply more comfortable with people. \"I rely more on who I really am,\" she said. \"Maybe it's all about unwitting authenticity.\" She emphasized that every moment is informed by previous moments of her life. She believes that she still has something to offer. As she learns to relinquish responsibilities, she recognizes that she has reached a new stage. \"I'm at a poignant, crucial part of my life.\" The Ann Arbor Zen Buddhist Temple is located at 1214 Packard Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104.

It's 7:00 a.m. and the day is starting at the Bird Center of Washtenaw County. Volunteers and interns are busy feeding birds, cleaning the birds' baskets, and answering phone calls. This routine continues with a rotating crew of volunteers and interns until 9:00 p.m. each night. Each bird has its own story of how it arrived at this nonprofit wildlife rehabilitation organization. There are birds who flew into windows, birds who fell out of nests, baby birds (fledglings) who were discovered all alone, and even birds who have been mistreated by humans. Last year the Center answered 3,460 calls and cared for over 1,000 birds. Sometimes the interns and volunteers can avert a problem just by answering a phone call. The Center gets approximately 300 calls each year from people concerned that baby birds have been abandoned by their mothers. The volunteers instruct the callers to leave the birds alone and watch them for the next hour. Clinic Director Bailey Last year the Center answered 3,460 calls and cared for over 1,000 birds.The Bird Center's strength is helping songbirds.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 71 Hughes said, \"In 99 percent of cases, the mother bird comes back after looking for food.\" Carol Akerlof, the Center's founder and executive director, added, \"A lot of good is done over the phone.\" Often the Center interacts with well-intentioned people who move birds from their habitats without getting instructions first. On a day last May, a tiny killdeer was delivered to the Bird Center. A child had found it in a local park, and the family took the bird to the Humane Society, which recommended they bring it to the Bird Center. The killdeer only had a short stay at the Center. During that time, the volunteers used a mirror so that the social bird wouldn't get lonely. It was peeping loudly for its parents. Since it wasn't injured, the interns determined it would be better off being reunited with other killdeers, and they took it back to the park where it was originally discovered. This May, the Center will open its doors for its twelfth season, but Akerlof has been helping injured and abandoned birds since the 1970s, when she first began caring for them in her home. When asked about her formative experiences with rescuing birds, she recalled that as a young girl living in Erie, Pennsylvania, she and her sisters lived along a busy rural road that was a popular spot for goldfinches. Unfortunately, they would often find birds that were killed by cars on the road, but it gave Akerlof an appreciation for their beauty. Years later, when she was living in Ann Arbor with her husband and children, she rescued a bird stuck in the backdrop of the baseball diamond at Winchell Park. The bird's foot was tangled in string and Akerlof took it home to her patio to cut off the string. When she cut the last piece of string, the bird flew away, leaving a strong impression on her. When her family moved to California from 1981 to 1983 for her husband's job, Akerlof became familiar with the work of the Palo Alto Wildlife Rescue. Before she moved back to Ann Arbor, Akerlof spent every day for a week from early morning until nighttime at the Palo Alto rescue. She was grateful that they were willing to share all of their volunteer training materials, and she was excited to share what she had learned when she returned to Michigan. Initially, Akerlof and Pat DeJong, founder of Ann Arbor's Friends of Wildlife, worked together with their rescue efforts, but eventually it made sense to run the organizations separately as a bird rescue and an animal rescue. Ann Arbor's Friends of Wildlife is one of a number of local organizations that help with referrals. The Bird Center's strength is helping songbirds. The Center's volunteers can give advice and short-term aid in an emergency for hawks, waterfowl, and owls, but there are organizations the Center works with that specifically help those types of birds. A Unique Home Before the Bird Center had a location, Akerlof and the other volunteers cared for birds in their homes. Feeding baby birds at 30-minute intervals from dawn to dusk is time consuming, and when volunteers needed to go on vacation that meant taking their birds to other volunteers. In 2004, the Bird Center received a grant from the James A. & Faith Knight Foundation, which enabled the Center to begin leasing space in a building on Mary Street that is over 100 years old and is owned by the City of Ann Arbor. Having the birds in one place allowed the Center to rely on volunteers for shifts instead of constant care. Akerlof is grateful for the opportunity to lease the space, but the building has many challenges, including the need for the Center to move out on election days so that the building can be used as a polling place. Its one room is so small that it is hard to imagine it being big enough to be a polling place. As the Bird Center, all of the space is utilized. Tables are filled with bird enclosures. Laundry baskets, buckets, an incubator, and even playpens serve as temporary homes for the birds. Supplies are stacked on shelves in the corners. It is orderly, but full. Akerlof would like to find a building that is larger than the current 700 square foot space. The Center needs an additional sink, more storage, and more room for birds and volunteers. The cramped quarters make it difficult when birds need to be quarantined (taking up some of the square footage). Akerlof said the nonprofit cannot afford to buy its own building, but she hopes there is a donor who would like to give the gift of property and have the lasting legacy of having his/her name on the Center. Making a Difference An explosion of noise greets the first shift of volunteers every morning as the birds anticipate being fed. Hughes said the volunteers sometimes get the food ready before they turn on the lights because the birds are so excited. She added that the volunteers and interns need to be ready for \"a lot happening at one time. Every day is different.\" Capacity can reach 120 birds depending on the birds' sizes and ages, but even 90 birds is a lot to handle. Caring for that many birds from 7:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m. each day requires a dedicated group of volunteers. In addition to the very important work of providing for the needs of the birds \u2014 food, medicine, and cleaning for example \u2014 volunteers also answer phone calls and help people who drop off rescued birds. Hughes started her involvement with the Bird Center as a half-time unpaid intern in the summer of 2007 while a student at Eastern Michigan University majoring in biology with a minor in zoology. Since then, she became head intern and is now clinic director. Before starting at the Bird Center, Hughes knew that she wanted to work hands-on with animals. Each summer she has enjoyed the work and learned more. She has an appreciation for Carol's decades of knowledge and dedication. She said, \"I owe a lot to Carol for what I've learned.\" In the summer of 2014, the Center employed eight full- time paid interns and eight part-time volunteer interns. Nicki James graduated from Michigan State University in 2014 with a degree in zoology and returned to the Center for her third year as an intern. James said the work can be \"challenging\" but also \"very rewarding and you come away feeling you made a difference for the people and the birds.\" Diane Hein-Beutel had a volunteer shift at the Center two years ago, and then last January, she became the volunteer coordinator. She said Akerlof is a \"very special person\" and that, \"There is a calmness to her. Even her voice is calming, and she is calming to the birds. She knows what birds need. She knows what people need.\" About half of the volunteers are college students. Hein- Beutel said she finds it \"refreshing\" to work with such a diverse group of volunteers. \"No matter what brings you [to volunteer], there is a shared sense of peace and accomplishment.\" Hein-Beutel pointed out that \"birds are all around us, part of our lives, and people don't often connect with them.\" She said it is powerful that \"the birds at the Center need some type of help, and they are relying on us to help them.\" Even though a volunteer shift can be very hectic, she finds volunteering at the Center \"soothing to the soul.\" Hein-Beutel realizes that volunteering directly with the birds is not a good fit for everyone and emphasized there are many volunteer needs in addition to taking care of the birds. Because of limited storage space, weekly shopping is important to keep the Center stocked with supplies. It's also important to have people willing to pick up injured birds when they are discovered. The volunteers don't need to have all of the skills because they go with someone else who is trained. A volunteer training is held every spring before the Center opens for the summer. By the end of the summer, many students have returned to college, and there are usually some spots to fill. The Center opens in the spring and the bird population Carol Akerlof, Executive Director - Gabrielle Costello, Shift Manager - Lisa Usselman, Shift Manager - Nicola James, Clinic Manager Carol Akerlof has been helping injured and abandoned birds since the 1970s, when she first began caring for them in her home.When she cut the last piece of string, the bird flew away, leaving a strong impression on her.

Last year the Center was still open in November. Volunteer help is important for the huge task of temporarily moving out to make room for the polling place for elections. Fundraising and marketing volunteers are also critical to the Center's mission. It costs approximately $100 for each bird that is cared for at the Center. Funded by Donations On Saturday, May 2, 2015 the Center will hold its fifth annual Fly Away Benefit and Auction fundraiser at Weber's. Weber's supports the fundraiser by charging the nonprofit for the food but providing the room at no charge. Akerlof is clear that every donation is important. A number of local veterinarians provide reduced rates, and in addition to donating some professional services, the Ann Arbor Animal Hospital provides the use of its dog training room free of charge when the Bird Center has to relocate during an election. Whole Foods Ann Arbor on Washtenaw regularly donates apples. Since they are for the mealworms, the Center actually wants the bad apples that aren't fit to donate to other nonprofits. Akerlof does not have a salary. Her enormous donation of time has always been volunteered.Helping People Connect with Wild Birds The Center is dedicated to educating both adults and children. One example is educating families who turn in a rescue. Some parents think keeping a baby bird is a great learning experience for their kids, and unfortunately they wait to call the Center until the bird is lethargic. Akerlof said, \"We understand kids have a connection with nature.\" To honor that connection and to foster the bonds people have formed with their rescues, each bird is assigned a number and people are welcome to call the Center and check on how the bird is by giving that number. The Center also has a blue jay that tours as a bird educator. \"Blue\" is registered with the state and federal governments so he can make educational presentations to a variety of groups. He goes to schools, but he also goes to senior citizens' groups. Both adults and children love the chance to observe him up close. Hein-Beutel said a visit from Blue helps people \"understand birds more readily.\" They can learn the importance of fledglings staying with parents and gain awareness of animal cruelty \u2014 that, for example, it is not okay to kick or throw rocks at birds. The Center's volunteers and interns release rehabilitated birds into their natural habitats. One of the most moving rescues involved 17 cliff swallows whose nests were illegally removed. The rehabilitation required some special arrangements. Volunteers set up a tent outside the Center where the swallows could fly during the day and a volunteer created stand alone perches. That happened two years ago, but Akerlof still fondly recalls when volunteers released the birds and they flew across the Huron River. Releases are never \"staged\" events. As soon as birds are healthy, it is time for them to be returned to their natural habitats, and the volunteers and interns who happen to be scheduled might get to see the release. One of Akerlof's favorite release spots is in The Arb. She recalled an early morning when she went to The Arb to release a bird. She noticed a family with a young child who got to witness the bird soaring up and up. As it reached the tops of the trees, it began making sounds and calling. Hughes recalled a crow with an injured foot that needed six months of care before he was able to perch properly. She said it is nice \"when you know you helped them, and they wouldn't have survived otherwise.\"The Bird Center of Washtenaw County Continued from page 71 An explosion of noise greets the first shift of volunteers every morning as the birds anticipate being fed. \"Birds are all around us, part of our lives, and people don't often connect with them.\" -Diane Hein-Beutel, volunteer coordinator\"[Carol Akerlof] is a special person....

She knows what people need.\" -Diane Hein-Beutel, volunteer coordinator ...To foster the bonds people have formed with their rescues, each bird is assigned a number and people are welcome to call the Center and check on how the bird is by giving that number.Photo by Doug RussellPhoto by Doug RussellThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 73 How To Help a Bird Advice from the Bird Center of Washtenaw County, reprinted with permission HEAD INJURIESTall buildings are the major cause of death for migratory birds. Lights in tall buildings should be turned off at night, and especially when the weather is foggy. Put decals on the outside of your home windows. Place bird feeders at least three feet away from a window. An injured bird's tail may be off to one side or you may suspect a collision because it is under a window or beside a road. These birds need medication immediately. Keep the bird warm, quiet, and confined and call the Bird Center for help. CAT CAUGHT BIRDS All birds that have been in a cat's mouth need antibiotics even if they don't appear to be injured. If they are not treated, they will die a long slow death in the wild from infection. Puncture wounds from the cat's teeth are often invisible. For your health and the welfare of your cat, keep it inside. If it does go outside, make sure that its rabies vaccination is up to date. FLEDGLINGS With the exception of a very small number of birds such as swallows and swifts, songbirds leave the nest unable to fly. They remain on the ground for a day or two until their wings become strong and they are able to flutter into low bushes for safety. During this time they fall prey to dogs and cats, children, well meaning adults, cars, lawnmowers, and so on. Fledglings should be able to walk or hop, and they should be covered with feathers. Watch the bird quietly from a distance for an hour. If during this time the parents arrive and feed the baby, all is well. Put cats and dogs inside, ask your neighbors to put their pets inside, and/or get out your garden hose so any potential threats can get a discouraging shower. HATCHLINGS AND NESTLINGS Finding a little pink hatchling or small nestling on the ground is a traumatic experience. If the nest can be found and the bird does not appear to be injured, returning it to the nest is an option. If the bird is very weak or cold and it is not opening its mouth to be fed, you should not return it to the nest. The parents will only feed young that open their mouths and beg for food. Call for advice immediately. Make a facial tissue nest and keep the bird warm at 85-90 degrees. Do not use grass because it is cold. INCONVENIENT NESTS Good nesting spots are scarce. Try not to remove old dead trees if they do not pose a risk. Almost all birds, eggs, nests, and nestlings are protected under federal law. A nest will not last forever. Call the Bird Center and we will try to give you an estimate of how long the nest will be occupied. We will also advise you on how to avoid the problem in the future. Check all nursery trees to be sure that yours does not contain a nest. If a tree must be removed during the spring and summer, watch it for some time to be sure that it does not contain a nest. PESTICIDES With the exception of doves, all songbirds are feeding their young the soft squishy insects, grubs, and worms that you or your lawn company may be trying to eradicate! Help your health and that of children, pets, and birds by eliminating pesticide use. Another rescue involved getting baby ducks out of a storm drain. When a local mother walking her son to school noticed the ducklings were trapped, she called Akerlof. Akerlof and a volunteer made duck calls into the opening, enticing all but one of the ducklings to come out. The intern even used his iPhone to play duck call noises, but one duckling had wandered too far inside and did not come close enough to be rescued. Akerlof and the intern left a concerned neighbor with a butterfly net and a bucket, and Akerlof was thrilled to hear from her later that day. It had rained and the water washed the duckling close enough to the opening that the woman who originally discovered the ducklings could rescue it. Akerlof said, \"There are a lot of good people who try hard to help wildlife. It makes a big difference.\" Whether it is providing educational information over the phone or taking care of an injured bird, the Bird Center of Washtenaw County is filling a unique need for the birds and people of Washtenaw County. Akerlof said, \"There isn't anyone else doing it.\" Akerlof has many stories of coming home to an empty box on her porch or at the Bird Center, so she strongly urges that people call the Center first before \"dropping off\" a bird on the doorstep. If you find a bird in distress, contact the Bird Center of Washtenaw County at (734) 761-9640 and visit their website for more information: www.birdcenterwashtenaw.org.

I grew up with a series of dogs, cats, ponies and horses, and even a cow, a couple of pigs, and a goat. My pony and my dog were my best friends, and I spent many happy hours exploring the fields, woods, and pond on our 40-acre farm. As a teenager, I planned on being a veterinarian, but after I flunked the required college physics class for the second time, I set that dream aside and contented myself with having pets. I stumbled into pet sitting a decade ago after nearly eight years as a professional bodyworker. In hindsight, it was an obvious choice for me, and I'm now one of those lucky people who've found the sweet spot between doing something they love and getting paid for doing it. I am a pet owner myself and have known since I was about 10 years old that having children was not on my \"to do\" list. My dogs are as close as I'm getting to children, so I understand when clients tell me that their pets are \"their babies.\" (Although I'm very clear that my dogs are, in fact, dogs and not \"little people in fur suits.\") I have a wealth of experience to draw upon and love when I'm able to be an information resource for my clients. I delight in being able to connect with so many different beings, and with being able to experience, through my clients, what it's like to have a hedgehog, a chinchilla, lizards, ferrets, or birds. Because my husband is allergic to cats, we're unable to have them, so it's especially nice to have so many kitty friends. While I have learned not to take anything that animals do personally, this is especially true for cats. It can take a while for kitties to warm up to people, and I literally have some cat clients that I've taken care of for years but only see when I search for them (for instance, under the bed). I'm always thrilled when a kitty that's hidden from me, or been aloof, finally allows me to pet him/her. Animals often act very differently with a pet sitter than they do with their own people.Dealing with poop, pee, vomit, blood, and animal bites and scratches are obvious \"occupational hazards\" in this line of work. Having to shove most of my arm down a dog's throat to retrieve a baby bunny that \"Fido\" is trying to eat is one that hadn't occurred to me before becoming a pet sitter, but it is something I've had to do more than once. Dealing with a client's flooded house, trapping feral cats, and \"re-homing\" raccoons are other tasks I hadn't considered before but have also had to deal with. Traffic and weather are big issues, too. Interestingly, many of the client-relations skills I learned as a massage therapist serve me well now, too \u2014 pet sitting is a much more people-intensive line of work than I had anticipated. Sometimes my people skills get stretched in ways I hadn't even thought possible, like when I had to become a \"doggie crisis counselor\" for the little girl who left her dog with us for a week while on a family vacation. This was the first time they had spent any time apart, and I had to send texts and pictures at least four times a day to console her and reassure her that her dog was happy and well.The Musings of a Pet Sitter I delight in being able to connect with so many different beings, and with being able to experience, through my clients, what it's like to have a hedgehog, a chinchilla, lizards, ferrets, or birds.

Now offering Nutrition Response Testing and Reiki!! 734-385-7161 Monica Turenne DVM,CVA The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 75 While I have not had an animal in my care die, I have come close. I have arrived at a client's home just after the vet tech who was there to give meds to an ill cat, and the vet tech was the one to find that \"Max\" had died in his sleep. I have also arrived at a client's home at the same time as the client, and we both discovered her dog having what turned out to be a fatal seizure. And my husband and I had a dog who was boarding with us take a turn for the worse on the morning of her scheduled departure \u2014 she literally collapsed on the front porch when her owner arrived. Her owner took her straight to the vet, where it was discovered she had a massive abdominal tumor that was bleeding out, and she was euthanized. I think she waited for her people to return before dying. Last month, I had to take a long-term client's cat to the vet's office for euthanasia. The client, who spends summers up north, trusted my team member Marcy and I to make the decision that it was time \u2014 \"Beanie,\" the 18-year-old, arthritic and deaf indoor/outdoor cat, had been having trouble breathing, and was starting to have seizures. Marcy and I stayed with Beanie until the end, with Marcy holding and petting her the entire time, sobbing as she did so. Like most of the professional pet sitters I know, I care deeply about the animals I look after. I don't think it's too grand a statement to say that pet sitting isn't just a job for many of us \u2014 it's a calling. We generally get very attached to our charges and consider the animals that we watch to be members of our extended family. We greatly enjoy developing a bond with them, and grieve when they move away, are suffering, injured or ill, or die. The relationship between a pet sitter and a client and their pet(s) is a very personal one, and often a very long-term one. If you're thinking of hiring a pet sitter, use your judgment \u2014 you are entrusting your home and your animal companions to this person! Not every sitter is a perfect fit for every family. Good communication is key to a good relationship. Do you feel comfortable with her/him? Does your pet? It's okay to ask questions and to ask for references. While I ask many questions when meeting with a new client, a written note with instructions (e.g., details on feeding or medication) is always helpful. And while they may seem like small things, hand soap, paper towels, and pen and paper in an obvious location are very helpful for your sitter.

It's easy as an adult to see children as experiencing a lot of freedom \u2014 usually freedom from paying bills, cooking meals, and working full-time jobs. But we live in a time when the percentage of children and teens who claim to be irritable, anxious, or fatigued hovers around 40 percent, similar to what has been reported for adults. The puzzling question then becomes: What is causing children and adolescents to become so overwhelmed and how can we help our children experience less stress? Before attempting to answer these questions, it is important to understand why stress and anxiety exist. Anxiety has an evolutionary purpose: aiding us in fight or flight when confronted with danger. Although, for the most part, humans are no longer exposed to the dangers our early ancestors faced, our fight or flight response has now attached itself to modern scenarios, like public speaking, meeting deadlines, keeping up with multiple responsibilities, and confronting social pressure. These scenarios can be easily applied to children and adolescents, and in fact, when confronting social pressure, children and teens are likely to be more vulnerable. Coming of age is inherently stressful as we find our place in the world and test boundaries, but there is a modern tendency to move beyond normal stress into unhealthy anxiety. Imagine the situation in which a high school freshman is at first pleased that her Instagram account has a growing number of followers. It is all too common for students (and adults) to derive a sense of self-worth and confidence from a good response to their carefully constructed social media and online personas, especially at a time when social status can feel so critically important. However, what if the student's Instagram account begins to fill with hurtful or rejecting comments? What if other teens voice dismissal of what the student has chosen to put forward? With such a slim backdrop for self-esteem, this student may start to question her ability to keep up with what is trendy, her social standing, and her ability to relate to her peers. She may start to question whether or not she can ultimately fit in. The more she internalizes the stress surrounding the situation, the more her fear might escalate beyond what is rational, pushing her to conclusions such as 'I'm not posting anything anymore' or even, 'I'll never fit in.' In another scenario, imagine a seventh grade boy who hates giving presentations in front of his social studies class because he gets nervous. The night before he has trouble sleeping, he can't eat breakfast, and while anticipating his turn, his heart races and his breathing becomes heavy. He may decide at the last moment to skip the class or stay home from school altogether. What for most people would be understandable jitters has amplified for him, affecting not just how he does on his presentation but how he participates in the world. When children and adolescents experience perpetual concern, insecurity, and feelings of impending doom, normal stress has developed into unhealthy anxiety that disrupts their ability to enjoy and benefit from educational, social, and interpersonal experiences. Anxious responses in children and adolescents can be the result of several factors: a biological predisposition for anxiety inherited from parents; learning by observing maladaptive coping methods in those around them; exposure to stressful and unstable environments; and a lack of care for the physical body, usually expressed as poor sleep, minimal exercise, and improper nutrition. Increasingly, school-age kids are exposed to society's value on success and, as a result, pressure is put on kids to succeed at everything they do \u2014 math, writing, gymnastics, soccer, piano, volunteering... the list can just go on. But is it actually a good thing for a child or teen's \"list\" to really \"go on\"? Shouldn't it be okay to play just one sport? One instrument? Shouldn't it be okay to engage in an activity for enjoyment rather than accomplishment and to remain an average rather than outstanding contributor? Shouldn't it be okay to enjoy unscheduled time? Without the chance to calm the mind and detach themselves from pressures and commitments, children and adolescents are ever more vulnerable to the development of anxiety.Another important factor is the omnipresent stimulation from \"screens.\" Some screen-time is okay; to say it isn't would contradict the call for enjoyment of unscheduled time. However, there is a give-and- take aspect to screen-time. It may be a way for children and adolescents to \"wind down,\" but the increased availability of screens exposes them to media portrayals of omnipresent danger (many major news headlines) as well as societal ideals, like body composition, material wealth, and respected accomplishments. These media representations of what is good, bad, right, or wrong can influence the mind and leave children and adolescents feeling frightened or inadequate. Untreated anxiety can have a domino-effect and can lead to: physical health complications, avoidance, and withdrawal; strains on relationships and family; and habit formed maladaptive coping strategies including substance use, eating disorders, sleep difficulties (too much or too little), increased time checked out on phones and computers; and the development of additional or more serious mental illnesses. So as a parent, what can you do to help your child or adolescent deal with stress or manage anxiety? First, think about the messages you give and receive. What do you emphasize as important? Do you encourage down time or is your child scheduled from morning to night? Would you encourage your child to miss out on recreation in order to do well on a school test, or would you strive for balance even at the cost of lower academic achievement? When your child plays a sport or signs up for a music class do you encourage fun or perfection? Remember the importance of balance. It is great to encourage your children to be their best, but being their best requires sound health foremost; and sound health requires downtime in order to rejuvenate the mind and body. Second, think about how you handle your own stress. When you were last upset by something, what might your family members have observed in your reaction? Do you primarily partake in healthy, proactive coping methods or do you let your stress get the best of you? Do you handle your own stress in ways that you would like to see your child handle stress? Children construct their behavior by observing those around them, so the next time you are feeling frazzled, try to consider what you would like to model for your family. Third, encourage healthy coping skills for the whole family. Make an exercise plan together or learn yoga with your child. Read up on the Cognitive-Behavioral practice of \"talking back\" to anxious or upsetting thoughts, such as those that tell you to be perfect at everything you do, or those that tell you to expect failure in anything you try. Thoughts like these can be combated with phrases like, \"It's exciting that I can keep improving,\" or \"I can do it, and it's okay if I need to ask for help!\" With your child, identify some of the fears that hold them back, such as a fear of meeting someone new, and set some goals to help conquer those fears in small steps. Finally, in the words of Queen Elsa from Frozen , help your child decide to \"let it go.\" Some things in life are certainly worth getting upset over, but the vast majority of what stresses us out does not fall into that category. Practice caring less if you are a few minutes late, if you spill something on your new shirt, or if you don't get that perfect score. In the end, you'll have more energy left to effectively handle the moments that are worth caring about, and in the meantime, you will feel a lot better.

The deadline for submissions for the May 2015 issue is March 1, 2015 . \"We are becoming a global culture and we need to recognize the interconnectedness of all of us,\" explained ordained interfaith minister Lauren Zinn. Inspired by how \"understanding others' traditions informs and deepens our understanding of our own traditions,\" Zinn founded ZinnHouse, an Ann Arbor-based organization that supports interfaith youth and their families by providing classes and community. Zinn's interest in youth and interfaith issues began more than fifteen years ago as she tried to integrate elements of various religious and spiritual paths into her own family. \"I was raised Jewish and then practiced Hinduism for a number of years,\" explained Zinn. \"Once I had children, I wondered what I was going to teach them about their Jewish roots and also about the wisdom that comes from other traditions.\" Zinn found that she was not alone in these struggles, especially in a community like Ann Arbor. Zinn ran an interfaith congregation from her home. Called \"Jewbilation: Jewish Roots with Interfaith Wings,\" the congregation met from 2001 to 2006. During that time, parents began sending their kids to Zinn, who also has a master's degree in philosophy, with an emphasis in philosophy for children, to talk about interfaith issues. Out of these discussions, a class called the \"Hebrew Play Group\" was founded. Over the past decade, this \"play group\" evolved and was renamed \"Jubilee,\" one of two classes Zinn currently offers through ZinnHouse. A multi-age class for youth in upper-elementary through early high school, Jubilee brings together kids from interfaith families to help them learn about various religious traditions. What the children have in common is that they all have Judaism as one of their \"home base\" religions; they also have one or more other religious or spiritual traditions or an interest in learning more about other traditions. What I explore in my classes is not strict Judaism, but it's also not 'a bit of this and a bit of that.' It's not a tour of world religions. It uses Judaism as a base, since that's common to all my students. My approach recognizes that religious, secular, atheist, ethical, and cultural worldviews all have something to offer us, especially toward understanding our home base religion.ZinnHouse and Interfaith Minister Lauren Zinn A multi-age class for youth in upper- elementary through early high school, Jubilee brings together kids from interfaith families to help them learn about various religious traditions.Lauren Zinn \"My approach recognizes that religious, secular, atheist, ethical, and cultural worldviews all have something to offer us, especially toward understanding our home base religion.\" - Lauren Zinn, founder of ZinnHouseZinn's group meets monthly in her home and has a monthly field trip related to the theme. Kids in the Community Photos by Susan AyerThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 79 Zinn's students are asked to utilize their \"home religion\" and to add a \"traveler's vision,\" which she described as the desire to learn what others are doing in order to better understand your own traditions. \"In my classes, there is no one doctrine or set of beliefs. I have one student who considers himself an atheist. I have another who says he is his name with -ist at the end. That is all fine here,\" she said. The students in Zinn's Jubilation class sign up for one year during which they explore many world religions and spiritual traditions. Some of these students have studied with Zinn for as long as ten years. The theme for this year's Jubilee is \"Equality for You and Me,\" drawing on ideas from the Torah that this is the seventh year, a year of rest for the land. \"For our group, we are bringing in ideas of the environment, of justice for the land, economic justice, feeding the needy, a resting time to think about justice for all,\" she explained. Zinn's group meets monthly in her home and has a monthly field trip related to the theme. For example, the group recently visited a renewable energy wind farm, made sustainable Shabbat candles, worked to help the hungry in connection with a visit to a Catholic church in Plymouth, and heard a speaker from Iran talking about Islam and banking in connection with social justice issues. Other field trips and programs are aimed at helping her students better understand others' religious traditions and rituals. They attended services at a local mosque and visited an area Mennonite community. I want the students to really experience these rituals and to have them be able to talk with people of different faiths. After the visits, we talk and debrief. We visited the mosque for one service, and I know the kids didn't understand everything, but that's not my goal.... They have an understanding about what happens there and that they are people like them and that they were wonderful with the kids. When travel to a house of worship is not practical, Zinn brings speakers to her students. Recent programs included a Native American speaker and a computer Skype visit with a school in Indonesia, during which the children shared ideas about school and faith. Monthly movie and discussion nights feature films related to different spiritual traditions, including Kumar, Life of Pi, and It's a Wonderful Life. Another significant part of Zinn's curriculum is what she calls \"Ten Advancements\" \u2014 principles, values, fears, and tensions related to how we approach faith and interfaith dialog. At an interfaith education conference, Zinn participated in a discussion with other religious educators about their fears in teaching interfaith education. Zinn said that a young rabbi shared his fear that if his one-year-old daughter was exposed to other faiths too early, she might identify with them and not with Judaism. \"My fear is different,\" said Zinn. \"My fear is that with no exposure to others' beliefs, children might get 'stuck.' We have a lot to learn from other people, from their different paths.\" She said that one of the Ten Advancements that she discusses with her students is the tension between integrity and identity with regard to faith. \"If we get stuck on identity, we can lose the integrity. It's not that one is more important than the other, \"We can gain knowledge from others' beliefs without losing our own.\" - Lauren Zinn but, to me, integrity requires a little more weight. We can gain knowledge from others' beliefs without losing our own.\" Zinn's students appreciate the opportunity to share their thoughts openly and to learn from their peers. A student wrote a letter to Zinn in which he said, \"Another thing that you gave me was a special opportunity: to openly discuss religion and philosophy in a comfortable setting with intelligent people.... I want to thank you for opening my eyes to a broader cultural-religious landscape.\" In addition to participating in the full-group activities, several members of each year's class are working toward their bar or bat mitzvah, or coming of age ceremony. Leading up to the ceremony, Zinn meets with the student individually to help him or her create a ceremony that is authentic and meaningful and that incorporates other religious or spiritual traditions in the family. For example, she helped create a bar mitzvah for a child whose father is Jewish, mother is Mennonite, and sister has Buddhist traditions because she was adopted from Nepal. Zinn explained: These can be considered very 'outside the box.' They would not be recognized by most Hebrew schools as a traditional bar mitzvah, but they are authentic to the student and their spiritual traditions. These are meaningful ceremonies. It's about integrity. Authenticity is more important than just following one religion if that doesn't reflect the family or the individual. Students do learn Hebrew and create their own Torah scroll in preparation for their ceremonies. \"I teach them to use a sewing machine to make the seams for their sticks,\" said Zinn. \"They joke that they come to Hebrew School to learn to sew, but it's an important life skill, too.\" Zinn, with the help of her husband, Frank, is also teaching a second class at ZinnHouse for older children, \"Money Inside Out.\" This class teaches kid about the fundamentals of money, including budgets, banking, credit/debt, interest, knowing one's financial personality, taxes, investing, and so on. Zinn said that she finds this class important because, without understanding these concepts, it is difficult to know how to help the underprivileged or advocate for social and economic justice. Other programs ZinnHouse offers include baby naming ceremonies, memorial ceremonies, interfaith couple's counseling, and interfaith wedding ceremonies. She is also in the final stages of developing several online programs for families called \"Philosophy and Religion for Kids\" (PARK) that could be led by parents themselves. These workshops may include topics such as forgiveness, traditions of giving and receiving, economic models and religion. These are previewed on the ZinnHouse website. Zinn is seeking feedback from a few parent reviewers and she encourages interested parents to email her. Ultimately, Zinn's hope for her students and their families is for them to develop their spiritual intelligence. \"I hope for them to expand their sense of self, to be grounded and inclusive, transcendent and transformative. Not just awareness of self and others, but a mastery of skills be to personally whole/authentic and integruous (I made up that word to mean a person of integrity), but also socially whole. We are moving from a 'me' society to a 'we' society and I want them to be ready,\" she said.

A recipient of this generosity wrote Sluymers a thank you card, which she has treasured for decades. \"I have showed it to my kids,\" said Sluymers. \"It is inspiration for their own philanthropic activities. My goal is to create a culture of caring and to start with my children, and all children.\" Sluymers fosters this \"culture of caring\" as the founder and executive director of Elameno-Peace, an Ann Arbor-based center for youth-inspired philanthropic activities. Before founding Elameno-Peace, Sluymers, a former teacher and long-time philanthropist, established The Brides Project in 2009, a nonprofit that collects new and used bridal wear to sell, with the proceeds benefiting families affected by cancer. Inspired by her own father's battle with cancer, Sluymers said The Brides Project is \"a way for brides to do good for others while also being budget-conscious, reusing. It's a win-win for all.\" In just three years, it raised over $250,000 and outgrew its first home in Sluymers' house. She has since found donated space and partnered with the Cancer Support Community to incorporate the project into their fundraising. Sluymers' work with The Brides Project showed her how successful social enterprise can be. At the same time, she felt a pull to develop a nonprofit that could help children pursue their own philanthropic projects. In 2012, her full-time teaching position was downsized and she decided to take a year off from paid work. \"A lot happened in my life in a short amount of time. I realized that I want to spend my time doing things that I find important, and helping kids do good is definitely important,\" she said. In fall 2012, she founded Elameno-Peace out of her home, using her own funds to build a website and to seed early \"meaningful and fun service projects for youth.\" Barb Hiltz acts as chief strategist and development consultant. One of the team's first projects was to make pillowcases for Camp Catch-a-Rainbow, a camp for children ages 4-15 who have cancer held at Camp Storer in Jackson. \"Like most things, it started small, with the idea that we could do good for the children at this amazing camp,\" said Sluymers. Several of her own children's friends expressed their interest and Sluymers advertised the event on the Elameno-Peace website and Facebook page. In a space provided by the Cancer Support Community, Elameno-Peace held a \"SewKind\" sewing event last May to make the pillowcases. \"We laid out all the fabrics like a store. Kids could choose their own fabrics and we taught them how to measure, how to follow a pattern, how to sew if they wanted to,\" said Sluymers. The kids wrote each camper a note to accompany the pillowcase. The Wednesday of camp week is a \"birthday\" celebration for all campers and each camper received a pillowcase. \"Many of the campers wrote letters back to our kids, thanking them for caring,\" she said. Katie Wilson, Camp Catch-a-Rainbow Coordinator, said, \"The pillowcases were a big hit! The personal notes that came with each one made the campers feel so special. Some of the parents told me that it's their child's favorite pillowcase and they rarely use a different one!\" During the time the pillowcases were being made, one of the young volunteers was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. She took a dozen pillowcases to the University of Michigan juvenile diabetes camp she attended. \"Now we plan to make this an annual project, making pillowcases for over 300 kids at these two camps. Kids want to do meaningful things for other kids. We can find them the space and help them get the tools and materials and they just run with it!\" said Sluymers. Planning is already underway for next year's SewKind activities. Youth can find out more by joining the Elameno-Peace Corps on the organization's website, www. elamenopeace.org, or by liking them on Facebook. Another on-going project is the Teddy Bear Triage Program, which emphasizes the value of repairing old/damaged stuffed friends while helping kids raise money for causes or projects important to them. Sluymers said that, as a child, she planned on becoming a veterinarian and worked in a veterinary clinic. While working there, she learned of the Farley Fund, a charitable organization that assists pet owners by subsidizing the cost of veterinary services. One of the ways they raised money for the fund was to host a \"stuffed animal hospital\" during which kids could bring in a favorite toy that might need repairs. \"For a donation to the fund, kids could wear a surgical gown and learn about animal care while having their own animal repaired,\" said Sluymers. She developed a similar program called \"Teddy Bear Triage,\" which she has offered the past two years at the annual Old West Side Children's Festival, a free event for children and families held in June in Wurster Park. \"Our mission at Elameno-Peace is to make the world a little better for all creatures,\" said Sluymers. \"We want kids to understand that it can be better to fix a worn, beloved animal rather than just buying new.... that we need to care about and come to the aid of animals and people in need. There's a lot that can be communicated through a simple action.\" Sluymers said that she teaches children to act as \"Teddynarians\" \u2014 like veterinarians who can do basic sewing and repair work. Repaired animals receive a certificate of good health with a note about \"healing those we have and valuing things that are older and loved,\" said Sluymers. Once a group of kids is trained, they could create a Teddy Bear Triage event at a location of their choosing in order to earn money for a cause they wish to support. \"For example, kids could host an event at a local bookstore that may donate space and the kids could keep half the profits for a charitable project of their choice and the other half would be reinvested in Elameno-Peace to provide for future projects and materials,\" explained Sluymers. \"Kids could also hold an event at an animal rescue and they could donate half the proceeds directly to them. Our goal is the let the kids make choices, to take ownership of the project.\"Elameno-Peace, A Center for Youth-Inspired Philanthropy Monique Sluymers, Founder and Executive Director Monique Sluymers ...she felt a pull to develop a nonprofit that could help children pursue their own philanthropic projects. One of the team's first projects was to make pillowcases for Camp Catch-a-Rainbow, a camp for children ages 4-15 who have cancer, held at Camp Storer in Jackson.\"Kids want to do meaningful things for other kids. We can find them the space and help them get the tools and materials and they just run with it!\" - Monique Sluymers, founder of Elameno-Peace Kids in the CommunityThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 81 A key aspect of Elameno-Peace's mission is to help kids learn about social entrepreneurship, creating business models or other innovative solutions that can help them fund their philanthropic goals. Sluymers said that kids involved with Elameno-Peace, including her own son, Owen, attended Detroit's version of National Lemonade Day last June. National Lemonade Day is an experiential learning program that started in 2007 as a way to teach youth about entrepreneurship and running small businesses. At the Detroit event, the Elameno-Peace kids won a contest to have a lemonade stand of their own. \"The kids went all out, they planned their pricing, created uniforms. That one stand raised over $500!\" said Sluymers. The Lemonade Day business model recommends that kids spend a third, save a third, and donate a third of profits; however, the kids decided to donate all their profits to a cause very dear to them. In July 2013, they lost a close friend, Stephen. To honor Stephen's memory, Bach Elementary School community members, along with Stephen's friends and family, are creating an outdoor theater space at Bach. \"When these kids realized that they, as kids, had the ability to raise this much money themselves for this important cause, they were really inspired,\" said Sluymers. Sluymers shared her kids' success with the Stephen's Theater Project Committee and \"Stands for Stephen\" was born. Children and their families found residents near the University of Michigan stadium who were willing to host lemonade \u2014 and later hot cocoa \u2014 stands on home football game days and sent messages asking classmates' families to donate baked goods and supplies. Sluymers said, The kids really wanted to raise money for their friend, but it's important to have the kids do it themselves. It's not just about asking their parents to write checks. I want these kids to know that one day, years from now, when they are playing on the stage, that they will know that they each played a real part in making it happen. The full circle nature of getting kids involved in philanthropy is so important. Kids have to make the connections between what they are doing and why they are doing it. The events raised just over $2,550 for the Stephen's Theater Project. Sluymers encourages kids or youth organizations to contact Elameno-Peace for help in making their own philanthropic projects successful. \"We want to support these kinds of activities however we can,\" she said. Sluymers has filed the paperwork to make Elameno-Peace a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit. Once this process is complete, Sluymers plans to further the Elameno-Peace mission of youth philanthropy by offering grants, micro-loans, and additional support services to help kids jumpstart new initiatives or to further develop existing programs. In 2015, Sluymers also plans to start hosting events, talks, and author presentations, in addition to continuing to promote youth service learning. She looks to partner with local bookstores and other youth-based organizations to host a variety of youth-centered literacy, cultural, and service learning events.\"We want kids to understand that it can be better to fix a worn, beloved animal rather than just buying new... that we need to care about and come to the aid of animals and people in need.\" - Monique Sluymers on Elameno-Peace's Teddy Bear Triage Program \"The full circle nature of getting kids involved in philanthropy is so important. Kids have to make the connections between what they are doing and why they are doing it.\"Above all, Sluymers said that what she enjoys doing most is brainstorming with people passionate about creating change in the world. If I could envision my perfect job, it would be to sit around all day talking about ideas and how to help people, especially children, achieve their goals to do good in the world. I want this for my children and for all children. This was brought home to me when a friend asked my child what I do. My child answered, 'My mom is changing the world.' They don't remember that I used to teach. They see me as a person who wants to change the world and I love that. She encourages anyone in need of support for a youth-driven service project \u2014 or who just wants to talk about changing the world \u2014 to contact her at Monique@elamenopeace.org.

For anyone seeking a break from the cold, Matthaei Botanical Gardens offers a variety of free and low-cost programs \u2014 and for those up for outdoor winter explorations, the surrounding trails and Nichols Arboretum showcase the beauty of Michigan's flora and fauna. Liz Glynn, Children's Program Coordinator for the Matthaei Botanical Gardens and Nichols Arboretum, described the facilities as \"hidden gems, especially during the winter months.\" She said many families don't realize how many activities are available simply for the cost of parking ($1.40 per hour). \"So much of our space can be enjoyed at such a low cost,\" she said. \"We want to make this available to everyone.\" Some of the most popular indoor activities are the \"Activity Backpacks\" that may be checked out at the entrance to the Conservatory. Each backpack contains seasonally-themed activities, including \"Trail Tales\" scavenger hunts to lead young explorers to various plant species, imaginative storytelling activities, and storybooks for the youngest children. Glynn said the backpacks are fun for preschoolers up to fifth or sixth grade. \"We also always include blank paper and sketching tools in the backpacks. While a young sibling enjoys Trail Tales or a storybook, an older sibling can just go off quietly and sketch,\" she said, adding that often the older siblings \u2014 and grown-ups \u2014 engage in the scavenger hunt activities as much as the younger children. In addition to the Activity Backpacks, which change according to the seasons, special exhibits that appeal to children are often curated in the Conservatory. A past program featured fairies and fairy houses hidden throughout the Conservatory. This March will feature a \"Shakespeare's Garden\" exhibit with posters from past performances of Shakespeare in the Arb, costumes, and plants featured in Shakespeare's works. Permanent features such as the koi ponds are favorites of children, as well.For families willing to brave the cold, winter can offer much outdoor beauty. Glynn said, I encourage families to come out and make a day of it here. Come and explore the trails outside. Look at the icicle formations, look for the bright red berries against the snow, look at the rosehips, at the red-twigged dogwood. It's also a fantastic time to look for animal tracks. There are always tons of tracks and footprints in the fresh snow. She added that while the trails in the Matthaei Botanical Gardens are not groomed for cross-country skiing, they are great for sleds and snowshoes. Glynn noted two trails that are especially nice for children. The Sue Reichert Discovery Trail provides a multi-sensory experience, leading visitors around Willow Pond with many native Michigan plants and trees, leaf casts, a willow-branch lodge, a \"bug meadow,\" and spotting scopes. The Sam Graham Trees Trail is home to a special collection of trees native to Michigan. Visitors see the trees in their natural or restored ecosystems, wandering from wetlands to floodplain forests to a tamarack swamp. Plaques for leaf rubbings are placed along the trail, and a tree rubbing booklet can be downloaded for free on Matthaei's website. Interpretive guides are also available in the Conservatory. \"These trails have different things to offer in the warm and cold months,\" said Glynn. \"The Sam Graham Trees Trail is great in the summer months when leaves are on the trees, but there's also great beauty in winter. When families get too cold, they can come on in to the Conservatory to enjoy snacks and hot chocolate at the snack bar and the fantastic warmth of our desert ecosystem.\" Hot chocolate is prominently featured in one of Glynn's favorite wintertime classes. Classes are offered most Saturdays (cost is $5-10, including materials; pre-registration guarantees a spot). The very popular \"Hot Chocolate Class\" is planned for Valentine's Day. \"We say it's about chocolate from tree to truffle,\" she said. The two-hour class explores the origins of chocolate and how our chocolate preferences have changed over time. Kids look at cocoa plants and beans, make chocolate from \"I encourage families to come out and make a day of it here... Look at the icicle formations, look for the bright red berries against the snow... look for animal tracks. There are always tons of tracks and footprints in the fresh snow.\" - Liz Glynn, Matthaei Children's Program Coordinator This March Matthaei will feature a \"Shakespeare's Garden\" exhibit with posters from past performances of Shakespeare in the Arb, costumes, and plants featured in Shakespeare's works.\"When families get too cold, they can come on in to the Conservatory to enjoy snacks and hot chocolate at the snack bar and the fantastic warmth of our desert ecosystem.\" Kids in the CommunityThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 83 cocoa nibs, and try different hot chocolates. \"But what's even more important is that, on a child's level, we talk about why chocolate has been and continues to be a charged agricultural product economically and socially,\" said Glynn. \"We talk about what choices they, even as kids, can make about fair trade chocolate and what that really means. That could mean that a child in another country can afford to go to school versus working in the fields all day. We empower kids to think about their choices, even with something that seems simple like chocolate.\" Glynn's personal interest in sustainability and fairness with food is long-standing. After receiving her degree in environmental education from the University of Michigan, she became connected with food cooperatives and collaborating with farmers. After more than twenty years working in co-ops, Glynn came back to education. \"I really enjoy working with children and families,\" she said. \"I love being able to do alternative approaches to education.\" Other Saturday morning children's programs have included \"Kids are Chefs, Too, Warm Winter Spices,\" \"Super Seedlings,\" and the very popular \"Fairy Door and Garden\" class which will be held in March. Glynn said: Kids love this one because we don't tell them how their project is supposed to look. We provide lots of beautiful, natural materials, like leaves, mosses, seedpods, and milkweed pods, to make into fairy beds. This isn't a class where we show them a sample and tell them how to glue their parts together. We provide materials and encouragement and let the kids design their own special projects. They leave with a working fairy door and a garden! Matthaei also offers a \"Family Tree Membership\" program that includes six kids' classes. For families seeking respite during mid-winter and spring school breaks, Matthaei offers two-hour weekday morning classes. These activities are held Tuesday through Friday during both Ann Arbor school break weeks and families can choose to register for one or all classes. Last year's activities included windowsill gardening, \"Flavor-Filled Friday\" featuring edible plants, worm composting, and paper-making. \"Our Spring Break activities were all related to encouraging kids to be 'eco-kids,' to empower kids to make good choices. It may not be fun to hear lectures about energy use or recycling, but it's lots of fun to make your own paper and to talk about recycling as we do it!\" These programs also cost $5-10. To learn more and register for Saturday classes and school break activities, visit the Calendar of Events at www.lsa.umich.edu/mbg/happening/calendar.asp. Matthaei Botanical Gardens also offers opportunities for Scouts and school groups to learn about native and exotic species. On Thursday evenings, Matthaei holds programs for Scout troops and other groups on themes such as making terrariums, trail treks, and exploring wetlands (during warm months). Glynn said that for Scouts working on specific badges, she can often help design activities to help accomplish their goals, citing a recent Wolf Pack that needed to learn about plant anatomy. Scout and group programs require at least six participants and cost $5 per child. Teachers seeking unique, hands-on, educational field trips should also look to Matthaei. \"Our school programs are very different from the rest of our programs in that they are very closely aligned with the Michigan grade-level curricula,\" said Glynn. \"We make sure that our programs meet state standards so that teachers can justify using their valuable class time to come here.\" For example, Matthaei offers field trips about seeds, plant lifecycles, and seed dispersal for second graders, and on ecosystems for fifth graders. Said Glynn: Many of our docents are retired teachers; they understand kids. Kids can sit in a classroom and read about seed dispersal or they can... walk the trails while docents show them seed dispersal.... They can walk into the different ecosystems in the Conservatory and they can feel the heat and the humidity. They can look at and feel the waxy coating on a plant and they can see how water runs off it when the mists go off. In the desert ecosystem, they can actually see how the spines create shade for the plants. This can't happen just from reading a textbook. Kids really respond to this. School programs can be scheduled Tuesdays through Fridays during the academic year. Glynn noted that subsidies are available for schools that show financial need (40 percent of students receiving free or reduced-price lunches). Glynn said she hopes to welcome many families to Matthaei Botanical Gardens this winter. \"We really do have a lot to offer,\" she said. \"Our mission is 'enriching lives through experiences in nature' and we do that all year around.\" For more information about the programs offered by Matthaei Botanical Gardens and Nichols Arboretum, visit www.lsa.umich.edu/mbg/ or contact Liz Glynn at lizglynn@umich.edu or (734) 763-6667. Matthaei Botanical Gardens is located at 1800 N.

Imagine some words to describe how that feeling-state felt in your body \u2014 perhaps you felt a heavy heart, a frozen throat, butterflies in your stomach, or a tight pressure in your head. Perhaps it felt hard to relax, to be focused and creative, or to feel a deep connection with yourself and others until the mood-state eventually passed. Maybe you couldn't wait until that mood experience was over! Now, imagine a simple intervention that inspires the opposite bodily and emotional feelings, including invigoration, flexibility, creative risk-taking, team building, focus in the \"now,\" laughter, joy, and a bodily \"letting loose.\" These qualities can all be ignited via improvisational theater exercises or \"improv\" for short. Improv is a type of community performance in which players spontaneously improvise dialogue and actions, flexibly building upon suggestions from the audience and the other team players in the scene. Many seasoned and well-known improv actors \u2014 including Tina Fey, Amy Poehler and Stephen Colbert \u2014 have shared that while improv may have sparked their comedic careers, the greater benefit to the training was the catalytic personal growth that the principles of improv naturally galvanize. Some of the powerful aspects of improv that therapeutically serve to shift moods are: The concept of \"Yes, And ...\" \u2014 a primary foundation of all improv exercises. No matter what is presented in the course of the exercise, each player's response is a \"yes\" to that reality with a subsequent expansion into new realms. For example, if during an exercise a player holds out his or her empty hand to you and states that there is a \"block of ice\" sitting in it, a \"Yes, And ...\" response would be to accept this reality of the \"block of ice\" and then add another element to it. This response could sound like, \"Wow, that ice must be cold! Good thing your hand is coated in peanut butter insulation!\" In contrast, a \"no\" response at any point (such as, \"There's no ice in your hand!\") would block the flow of the exercise and lead to a deflation of the creative energy and a negation of your team member. This \"Yes, And ...\" approach teaches many things, including breaking through negative barriers, opening up new neural networks, and honing social connection. It trains each player to stay focused in the present moment, as you must be aware of what your team members are saying and doing to acknowledge and expand on what is happening. In terms of mood healing, according to Earl Vickers, \"The 'Yes, And ...' principle suggests a useful way of processing painful emotions. Instead of simply repressing such emotions (i.e., saying 'no'), it may be better to experience these emotions fully ('yes'), and then restructure them or cultivate new positive emotions ('and').\" The healing effect of whole body laughter. One common denominator during improv practice is that at some point laughter will bellow through the room. Improv exercises shift people out of their restrictive comfort zones and create unique experiences of silly play, sounds, and bodily postures. Laughter during improv is a supportive experience that is almost invariably \"with\" and not \"at\" each other. The physiological benefits of laughter are numerous and include reducing stress and tension, triggering \"feel good\" endorphin release in the brain, increasing oxygen flow to the organs, enhancing immunity, relieving pain, and relieving depression and anxiety. Increased resilience and self-acceptance. Two sayings in improv are \"mistakes are gifts\" and \"enter the danger.\" There is no perfection in improv. The more someone is \"trying\" to be funny or an expert performer, the less effective, humorous, and relaxing the exercises are for everyone. The gift of each person is his/her willingness to present his/her vulnerable self and take spontaneous personal and creative risks in the exercises, with positive social support offered by one's teammates for doing so. Instead of avoiding aspects of oneself, there is a moving into one's bodily expression, emotions and life experiences to embrace all of who one is. Allowing for mistakes and vulnerable risk-taking also serves to confront one's fear of failure and tendency to \"over-think\" life choices and moods, because in improv there is no time to over-process \u2014 only time to \"act\" and \"do\" and respond in the present moment to whatever is happening. Through the practice of improv, spontaneous expressive energy is catalyzed. This infuses change and growth into \"stuck systems,\" including stuck moods and their concurrent bodily sensations. The fearful frozen throat becomes thawed with creative risk-taking. The sad heavy heart lightens with laughter. The irritating head pressure releases as energy and oxygen circulate throughout one's whole body. The anxious butterflies in one's stomach are faced, embraced, and moved through. Connection to others and oneself is enhanced. If you would like to practice improv to help your own moods shift, here are resources that may be helpful: Go Comedy!

Exceptional Healing Healing Work. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 98 Psychic Protection and Support for Your Auric Field with Black Tourmaline Black tourmaline is a powerful and highly useful stone for both the professional healer and the average person alike. Its therapeutic benefits are endless. Known for its protective and grounding properties, black tourmaline can protect against many forms of negative energy. It quickly dissolves low, dense negative energy and transmutes it to higher energetic vibrations. Not only can black tourmaline help ward against psychic attack, but it can also help dissolve negative thinking about yourself and others. It can also serve as an energetic guardian for all corners of your home or workspace, and help cleanse the energies in these spaces as well. As a powerful grounding stone, black tourmaline is extremely helpful for sorting out inner emotional dispute and providing mental stability. It helps us reconnect to the earth by creating a circuit of energy between our own energetic fields and the earth, grounding out our chaotic energies. It brings about a sweeping of our auras, providing not only instant grounding but cleansing and protection from others' negative energetic patterns. Sometimes we encounter people throughout our day who tend to steal our energies. This can be very tiring or draining. So what is this psychic energetic drain? It is a deliberate energetic intrusion upon your aura, without your conscious permission. This could be done lightly or much more intrusively, by a person, place, thing, or group, leaving you feel very open, exposed, vulnerable, or anxious, even to the point of panic. We can also unconsciously attract lower energies based on how we are feeling. When unresolved feelings of fear and anger linger within us, non-serving energies can attach to these feelings and fuel the energy they create, which can blow things way out of proportion. Psychic attacks can also happen through etheric cord attachment, which is when a person, place, or thing attaches those lower energies to you via a tunnel of energy, or \"cord,\" between you and the source, with you as the receiver, or the reverse can happen if we attach our energies to things. These cords can affect us deeply by connecting to one or more chakra points in our bodies and energy fields, which can cause emotional distress or even physical sickness and disease. Black tourmaline is an excellent way to prevent these attachments from manipulating your energy. In some cases, though, it's best to deal with these attachments by seeing a professional, especially if the chaotic energy is affecting every part of your life \u2014 relationships, finances, etc. \u2014 or just creating difficulty surviving in this world day to day. Have you heard of electromagnetic stress or smog? It's another way that chaotic energies, this time from our environment, can throw us out of alignment and form attachments or steal energy from our bodies. It's everywhere, all around us, and even though we can't see it, it affects our energetic bodies. The effects of prolonged exposure to strong electromagnetic waves have been thought to cause major illness, fatigue, stress, sleep disturbances, skin symptoms, various body pains or ache symptoms, eye fatigue or burning, ear, nose, and throat symptoms, digestive disorders, and possible anxiety or depression. Electromagnetic frequencies, or EMF waves, are produced by the electrical output of all electronic equipment. For example: computers, cell phones, TVs, radios, power lines, satellite dishes, and so on. What is one of the best EMF blockers on the market? Black tourmaline. Ways To Use Black Tourmaline Wear this stone or carry it with you to protect yourself from negativity or possible psychic attack. Support meditation by surrounding yourself with small pieces of black tourmaline, creating a sacred net of energy to capture and redirect lower and chaotic energies so as to be removed from your body. Put this stone near all entrances/exits, including windows, to help protect all corners of your home against intruders or energetic intrusion. Put pieces of black tourmaline in desk drawers, around the perimeter of your cubicle or office, and around all electronic equipment on your desk to help protect against negativity in a workspace or office. Tape or glue pieces of black tourmaline to your laptop or cell phone case to help decrease EMF from your electronics. You can also surround home theater equipment, speakers, or TVs as well for the same effect. Use black tourmaline that is tumbled or polished in a gem elixir to help boost the immune system, treat arthritis and dyslexia, provide pain relief, and help bring the body back to natural balance.

Photo by Rachael Waring The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 106 Use y our own spiritual practices \u2014 journaling, art, movement, and so on \u2014 to ask for guidance about who is calling you Pr epare to be surprised! Working with Your God/dess Once a god/dess has claimed you, your work (and play!) together can take a variety of magikal forms and focus on essentially any subject. The substance of my work with Sekhmet over the years has been claiming my innate power to stand up for myself and what I believe. Generally, the form has been trance journeys to her temple in the Egyptian desert. Sometimes we just talked; others, she led ritual. She often did what I can only describe as zapping me with a jolt of energy to my solar plexus; these were energizing and powerful healing \"treatments.\" With Isis, the substance of our work was about claiming the power of opening my heart and allowing myself to be vulnerable. I didn't travel to connect with her; she was simply always present and available when I needed her, like a perfect mother. She would often just hold me tenderly, and sometimes sing to me. I grieved many losses and healed a lot of hurt in her presence; there were times when I cried my eyes out in her arms. She loved me until I claimed my love for myself again. Currently, I work and play with both Isis and Sekhmet in my personal practice. Sometimes it's both of them together; sometimes they decide which one will take the lead; sometimes they let me choose. Integrating their respective gifts and aspects has given me a comprehensive sense of Divine feminine power and what it means to be powerful as a woman. I have equal access to the power of my solar plexus and my heart, and integrate them or choose which to emphasize depending on what's called for in the situation. Your relationship with your god/dess is a co-creative partnership that is unique to the two of you \u2014 and your playing field is nearly infinite. If Sekhmet claims you, for example, your relationship with her will likely be entirely different from what I've described as mine with her. Let yourself follow your god/dess' lead; after all, s/he is a reflection of unclaimed parts of yourself. Trusting his/her guidance will bring you to see her in yourself, and yourself in him. In other words, you are your god/dess, and s/he is you. Yes \u2014 you are divine. Let the transformation begin!Nancy L. Ogilvie is an initiated priestess who primarily practices Dianic Wicca (honoring all forms of the Divine Feminine). She is available to lead ritual/ceremony (including weddings, baby blessings, and any ritual of transition), to train or mentor budding priestesses, and to teach classes on Wiccan practice. You can reach her at nancylogilvie@gmail.com or (510) 825-3125. The beautiful card images featured in this article are from The Goddess Oracle Deck & Book Set by Amy Sophia Marashinsky (Author), Hrana Janto (Illustrator), and are availbe for purchase at Crazy Wisdom. Mastered the basics of Wicca and wondering what's next? Looking for something to support you as we move deeper into winter and the dark time of year? You may want to begin working in depth with a particular god or goddess. This relationship can provide powerful guidance and support in your spiritual development, thereby helping you live a richer, more fulfilling life. In this article, I provide some tips for this form of ritual work and share my story of working with two Egyptian goddesses, Isis and Sekhmet. I hope my experiences will provide you with some ideas and suggestions for your own journey. Opening to Your God/dess I first had this section titled \"Choosing a God/dess to Work With,\" and immediately realized that my experience was closer to one of being claimed by Sekhmet. She is a fire goddess, and her name means \"Sacred Power and Might.\" She is generally depicted as a woman with the head of a lion, and she carries that big, \"roaring\" energy. Always crystal clear about what she wants and never abashed about claiming it, Sekhmet came blasting into my life. Almost before I knew it, she had taken me as her priestess, simply assuming I would follow her. When I was preparing to lead a ritual, she provided direction and instruction. When I was meditating, she often summoned me to her temple in the Egyptian desert, and provided direction and guidance for my daily life. Once when I was beginning a session with my craniosacral therapist, she showed up and began giving direction to the healer. She was an ongoing presence, mentor, and teacher in these ways for about eight years. Isis came into my life in a very different way, but still with no sense that I chose her. About eight years after I first started working with Sekhmet, I was priestessing a ritual that included a trance journey; in my own trance, Sekhmet was leading a procession I was a part of as her priestess. At a crossroads, we met another procession led by Isis, and both processions stopped. Sekhmet and Isis stepped forward, and called me toward them. Sekhmet said to me, \"Our work is complete; you continue with Isis now,\" and they led a beautiful ritual of transition. I joined Isis' procession, and both went on their respective ways. Isis is also extremely powerful in her own right, but she is a water goddess, so her energy is much softer, more flowing than Sekhmet's. Isis' energy is largely heart-based, where Sekhmet's is more solar plexus-based. In the transition ritual, I recognized that I had reintegrated enough of Sekhmet's fierceness, and that it was time to soften its edges in me. Through my work with Isis, I've opened my heart and allowed more compassion and tenderness into my sense of power. So clearly, identifying a god/dess to work with is not about consciously choosing one in a rational, logical way. Reason and intellect have a role \u2014 and the decision is far more an intuitive, receptive process. Here are some things you can do in ritual space (sacred space usually created by invoking the directions and/or a god/dess so you can be in an altered state safely) to open yourself to whoever wants to come in: When y ou're outside, notice which of the elements you feel more drawn to Cr eate a ritual to ask the god/dess who is calling you to show him/herself (and know that it may not happen right away) A ttend or create rituals honoring different god/desses to see who calls you R ead the stories of different god/desses, and then check in with your inner wisdom. Who do you feel drawn to?

The CRAZY WISDOM CALENDARThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2015 Page 110 Now including personal training/corrective exercise! 4,500 Circular breathing tends to feel a bit \u2014 or more than a bit \u2014 uncomfortable and awkward at first. Y our mouth can get dry, your chest can feel tight, and emotions tend to come to the surface. Breathwork is done with and without music, with and without touch, with and without movement, individually and in groups. It is often mixed with other therapies or spiritual practices.Therapeutic Breathwork Training (a story) By Andrea Hill I re-experienced my own birth the other day, for the third time in a week. I was in Milwaukee, at Transformations, Inc., with Jim Morningstar, a dedicated and compassionate psychotherapist, breath coach, writer, and Therapeutic Breathwork teacher. Sitting in Jim's comfortable office, after a week of intensive breathwork training and experience, we began the session by talking about what I would like to focus on. I asked for inner child work. I knew that this was a gift of his \u2014 that he has been perfecting the art of the healing conversation for a long time \u2014 and I had some childhood emotional patterns I wanted support in clarifying. I was quite primed for this session after our week of training. Jim Morningstar, along with Steve Moe and others, had led around 25 of us students through several breathwork sessions a day, each with a different flavor or focus. We were inside, outside, and underwater, facilitating each other individually and in groups. We were psychotherapists, social workers, bodyworkers, and shamanic healers. I felt instantly connected to this group of people who were willing to press through discomfort in order to live freer, more authentic lives and help others do the same. For me, this was the culmination of a distance-learning course with Jim, which was my entry into offering breathwork professionally. I have been a spiritual explorer since childhood and a bodyworker since 1990, which has given me the opportunity to witness the deep connection between physical, emotional, and spiritual life. I love anything that helps integrate these for a person, and breathwork is a lovely way to do that. I was attracted to it first during a particularly intense time of my life, several years ago, as I was going through a divorce. I didn't want the emotional pain to lodge in my body, so when a friend suggested Transformational Breathwork with Julie Wolcott of Breathe Ann Arbor, I tried it out. With her and her business partner Marcia Bailey, I was able to grieve holistically, release trauma and feel a deeper connection to my innate joy and creativity. If you've never heard of breathwork, you are not alone. Maybe this will help give you an idea: \"Breathwork,\" as I am using it here, has roots in yoga, but it is not the yogic system of breathing called pranayama . It is a general term that Breathwork, Therapeutic Breathwork, Holotropic Breathwork, Rebirthing Breathwork, and other forms that derived from psychotherapy and use a circular breath pattern. Circular means no pause in between the inhale and the exhale. It is a little faster than normal breathing, done through the mouth. The various forms of breathwork bring different styles and philosophies to the practice. Imagine Bikram yoga versus Iyengar yoga. For example, in my experience with Transformational Breathwork, we used specific pressure points and corresponding affirmations during a breath session. Jim Morningstar's approach in Therapeutic Breathwork is more open-ended in terms of using bodywork and affirmations, but it felt instantly familiar to me because of the circular breath. Breathwork is done with and without music, with and without touch, with and without movement, individually and in groups. It is often mixed with other therapies or spiritual practices. Circular breathing tends to feel a bit \u2014 or more than a bit \u2014 uncomfortable and awkward at first. Your mouth can get dry, your chest can feel tight, and emotions tend to come to the surface. Body-mind tension is amplified, and it can feel boring or irritating. The breathworker, or breath coach, is there to listen and offer support in moving through these sensations without shutting down the breath, so that eventually, a point comes where the circular breath feels natural. It is surprising but true that after a while, it actually feels good. I have found myself continuing it into my day because it feels weird to stop. That natural point where it becomes easy is lovely. It is the point where breathing becomes a deep, moving meditation that has served me on all levels. Something about circular breathing activates the body-mind's own healing mechanisms. If you have ever experienced \"unwinding\" in bodywork you'll know what I mean. You enter a light trance, perfectly conscious and in control, and at the same time, accessing parts of yourself that aren't normally available. Sometimes unresolved life (or even past or extra-life) experiences come back \u2014 not as a memory but as a bodily re-experiencing. In this, there is tremendous opportunity for learning and healing. A traumatic memory does not go away, but breathing through it with self-love and supportive connection changes your relationship to it. The charge is lifted, and it no longer affects present day experience in the same way. This has changed my perspective on my own emotions and life experience in general. It gives me a tremendous amount of hope, knowing that trauma is not as permanent as it seems. When I breathe for my own healing, I do it to bring in more life force, feel uncaused happiness, and release any blocks that I'm ready to. Re-experiencing my birth was not something I tried to do, nor something I try to create now for myself or my clients. It just came up as part of my process \u2014 and it comes up often enough in breathwork that it is considered normal. Quite a vulnerable thing to go through, right? Yes. Yes. Yes. It is tender, squishy, and often tearful. It is not just remembering with the mind, but re-experiencing through the cells. You are in it. And the gorgeous beauty of this is that you get to re-experience it on your own terms in a safe place. While feeling myself as a pre-born baby, I had a conversation with Jim. \"I don't want to come out yet. I need to know it will be safe. No forceps. I come out when I'm ready and not before. I have another place I need to say goodbye to that I can see right now...\" Jim gave me his shoulders to push against, simulating pushing my way out, entering the world in a new way that felt safe, supported, and complete. I am changed by this, and by all the loving interactions and breath experiences I had during training. A group of perfectly imperfect people came together to explore and evolve; to loosen what restricts our creative movement and life energy; to understand ourselves better, in order to make more conscious choices in our lives. I love that. Andrea Hill, B.S., L.M.T., originally wrote this story some months back, and has since then incorporated breathwork into her healing practice. She is now a mentor for students of Jim Morningstar's school. Her practice is called Body Poetry Therapies, where she offers Therapeutic Massage, Breathwork, and Aromatherapy. You can reach her at (734) 255-8487 or ahillbodypoetry@gmail.com.
